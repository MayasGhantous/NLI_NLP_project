  http://www.tripadvisor.com.br/restaurant_review-g189180-d953422-reviews-restaurante_bufete_fase-porto_porto_district_northern_portugal.html the negative aspect of the tasca is ... well . . it is a tasca . 
  do not expect fancy stuff , we have plenty of good restaurants with that , in fact i could give you a list of restaurants , but this is the closest to a tasca experience , the true porto tasca from my childhood memories . 
  francesinha is the obvious choice here . 
  it depends , modern tascas are just regular restaurants with tapas basically . 
  the real tascas well those are nearly extinct . 
  clerigos , recently renovated , with a museum and the best views of the city . 
  also the area around the tower is the `` to go place '' of porto , for food/party/drinks / coffee . 
  ribeira , to see the river , the bridges , to have some wine . 
  also since it is blazing hot here , try the boat trip under the 6 bridges . 
  get lost in our streets , from rua das flores , to mouzinho da silveira , to santa catarina , porto lives , and the only way to live it is walking around . 
  be aware , it is quite hilly . 
  palacio da bolsa , for me the jewel of porto , with its arab room . 
  located near ribeira . 
  if you are into museums and great gardens please do visit serralves instead , located between foz and boavista , where casa da musica is located . 
  foz at the end of the day , take the bus , it takes a while but you can relax at the beach , visit parque da cidade , have some drinks , and enjoy our weather . 
  this should fill 2 days , in fact you might not have time to do everything . 
  there is much more to discover here , and around . 
  douro is the place if you like driving . 
  try it during summer time . 
  winter is quite deadly around there . 
  3 things : - the food , including the wine . 
  francesinhas , tripas \u00e0 moda do porto and the wine that makes every dinner with friends great . 
  - how pretty the city and the region actually are . 
  i have been around europe and i ca n't find similar places , the closest are probably in galiza . 
  walking around porto since i was born and i am not bored yet . 
  the river has also some of the best views you can get in europe . 
  - the people of porto . 
  people make the difference , you might live in a beautiful place , but what makes it special ? 
  the people . 
  they feel the connection to the region and to the cities they live in ( braga , guimar\u00e3es , povoa , etc ) and they transmit that . 
  they are often , as the portuguese in general are , welcoming , engaging , and quite direct to the point here in porto . 
  the parties , the traditions , and our motivation towards our region makes even a new tree in the city sound special . 
  so when everything around you means something to you , the place gains a new definition too , home . 
  and i like to think that when people visit porto , even for one day , they feel that little bit of our home . 
  some say it is just the food , maybe they are right , ca n't really blame them xd, 
  thanks !, 
  loads of connections to europe people , no excuses  !, 
  yeap they seem to have a lot of difficulty understanding us . 
  problematic during my trips to spain . 
  had to learn with duolingo to effectively avoid using english in spain . 
  the one in douro , from pinh\u00e3o to regua . 
  http://www.ipressjournal.pt/a-estrada-peso-da-regua-ao-pinhao-e-world-best-driving-road/ i personally love the one in madeira , that goes up to the encumeada, 
  portuguese from porto , north of portugal . 
  ask what you like about the city/region . 
  sorry bros =( we still love you though galiza !, 
  wet as the ocean . 
  drugs are not legal , they are decriminalized . 
  you ca n't sell or walk around with over a certain amount of illegal substances with you . 
  but you can consume it , and you wo n't go to jail for it . 
  you will be fined however . 
  we see it as an addiction , a disease such as tobacco consumption , and it is treated as a disease , with quite good results since people usually will tell you what they consume , how much , etc. 
  ( i am a doctor here ) . 
  curiously people are much more reluctant to talk about their alcoholism . 
  ok ... ei spain , let us get together and start our own eurozone government , iberia !, 
  ( * you must have gazpacho in the national gastronomy to join ) ( ** sunny days are 80 % guaranteed ) ( *** we almost understand each other without a translator . 
  almost ), 
  is it a permanent exposition ? 
  pretty cool !, 
  let me think . 
  hard to choose . 
  well i think i have to say spain . 
  a mega rectangle . 
  people all over the world would be like '' what is that thing ?? '', 
  we were almost soviet in the 70s . 
  do n't ask me how or why . 
  those damned mongols . 
  yeah !!!, 
  and you are the best and the worst at the same time . 
  because you are the only neighbor we have !, 
  eheh i really like spain, 
  it looks like those airport flags . 
  they should hire a designer or something . 
  or just place the map over a white background . 
  yes i think so, 
  yeap 1 elected, 
  this . 
  i use london as a hub . 
  also i want uk to grow because if trade partners grow , we grow . 
  they have the best food and the best wine . 
  tomato soup from alentejo with aged cheese as a side plate with regional wine x.x dauuummm, 
  true and also about alentejanos . 
  we also have a daily tool named after our dictator . 
  has anyone ever crossed the border ? 
  my car ca n't cross dunes and i heard our trains also do n't fare particularly well . 
  i have always wondered if there are any camels or pyramids . 
  maybe even france somewhere out there . 
  well after i saw that report in tvi i was pretty shocked . 
  in europe doing that ? 
  well i recently saw a news report here in portugal about how your country 's social security makes money stealing portuguese babies . 
  that did n't help . 
  green areas and we need a useful bus network ( porto portugal ) . 
  i agree . 
  highways , shoppings , roads to everywhere , an international airport , hospitals . 
  still loads of nature around the main city . 
  so true !, 
  maybe he is a martian . 
  now they say he is from pakistan but who knows right ? 
  i read you had a flag sticker on your cat . 
  sounded pretty hardcore to me to try to put a flag on the face of a cat . 
  turkey is learning from portugal 1939 .

i had no idea different countries had different approachs to how they list their parties . 
  for example , in portugal the order is randomly selected for each election , which i think is a great idea . 
  i 'm not sure what i think about the slogans ( we do n't have them here either ) , but ... are n't logos useful for people who ca n't read ? 
  portugal tried cet ~ 15 years ago and it did n't go well . 
  mostly because the sunsets were too late and kids did n't want to go to bed at night because there was still light . 
  it 's not that we do n't have good things in our country . 
  it 's that we ca n't enjoy them while worried about money . 
  how can i enjoy that awesome food if i ca n't afford to go to the restaurant ? 
  how can i enjoy the awesome landscapes if i ca n't go anywhere with my car because the gas is so expensive ? 
  i could go outside and enjoy the sun if i did n't have to babysit the washing machine so it does n't flood the kitchen ; and i do n't have money to buy a new one . 
  maybe i 'm just proving your post right . 
  but i feel our place in that list is deserved . 
  i can see the good things in my life . 
  it 's just that they pale when i remember all the little things that are breaking or are broken and are slowly bringing our quality of life down , and i ca n't do anything to fix them , and there 's no light at the end of the tunnel . 
  the worst part is that there is no hope of change in the next months , or maybe even years . 
  i did n't mean to add such a dark tone to an otherwise happy thread , but i wrote it , so i 'm going to post it anyway . 
  thanks for reading this far . 
  it 's not really merkel 's first time either . 
  noooo not the north european work ethic !, 
  next thing i know i will have to stay indoors working because i ca n't stand how sunny and warm it is outside ... 
  there are a lot of ways to get your e-mail address added to these lists . 
  if the e-mail is listed anywhere in the web , it has a good chance to be found by a bot created to search for them . 
  if you signed up to a website with your e-mail and their databases were hacked , your e-mail was leaked . 
  if the company is doing badly , they might sell off that information to other companies themselves . 
  if someone 's e-mail is hacked , anyone in their contact list will have their e-mail revealed too . 
  and my personal favourite : people who forward those funny jokes/missing dog/missing person e-mails while putting everyone in cc , and not deleting the header from the previous e-mail . 
  i actually have a doc with hundreds of e-mail addresses that i saved from a couple of e-mails like that - it had like 4 or 5 different headers with all the e-mail accounts the previous people sent to ... 
  people arriving late . 
  we agreed on time * x * to be here , you 're not supposed to be leaving the house at * x * if you take 10 or 20 minutes to get to the place where you should be . 
  i 'll admit i used to be like this too but now i make a conscious effort not to do it . 
  i have only been late to a meeting * once * this year !, 
  i spotted the northern !, 
  but seriously , i did n't mean it as a bad thing . 
  it just is . 
  people from the north , especially north of the douro river , tend to lean more right-wing ( psd and cds-pp ) , while the south ( alentejo ) usually vote for the communist party ( pcp ) . 
  ^ ( i think there is an historical reason for this if you 'd like me to explain further . ), 
  oh , and people from the north swear * a lot * . 
  regarding big cities vs interior , i feel like the people in big cities tend to be more open-minded towards `` new '' things like gay marriage , abortion or drugs . 
  but you tend to write some of the letters in the word together ( at least i do ) , which does n't happen in numbers . 
  in the end i guess it comes down to personal preference . 
  we do , 2 plus 2 equals 3 here in europe , and we also count everything in base 8 instead of base 10 . 
  when you 're hand writing it 's a good idea to use either commas or periods instead of trying to adjust the spacing between the numbers . 
  i 'll agree with you on the fact that the debt appears to be unsustainable . 
  greece says so too , and one of their demands was that part of that debt was written off . 
  imo that should have been done now instead of kicking the can down the road , because that problem will only grow bigger as time goes by . 
  glad to hear you 're not against bailouts . 
  the problem here is that the conditions that were demanded are counter-productive if the intention is to be able to pay off the debt . 
  it 's like you let someone work in freezing cold to pay off their debts but you demand they sell off their jacket first and then complain they ca n't do any work . 
  austerity measures shrank the greek economy and reduced the amount of money they are able to collect through taxes - for example , businesses going bankrupt pay no taxes and increase unemployment , unemployed people not only pay no income tax but they also receive benefits for some time . 
  less money available for the middle class also means more tax evasion as people need to choose between paying their taxes and eating . 
  these are just economic arguments , i 'm not even going to argue about the humanitarian part , because that should be obvious . 
  increased rate of suicide , increased rate of infant death and death in general as the quality of healthcare in general decreases ; i do n't think these are acceptable `` side effects '' to pay off the big banks . 
  does this really have to be a competition about who has it worse ? 
  i concede that there are countries that are worse off than greece . 
  that does n't change the fact that the conditions imposed on greece are more about punishment than they are about money . 
  this is a political issue - stomp down on the leftist government and force them to accept twice as much austerity as they would propose to a right-wing government . 
  refuse to negotiate until a certain person is removed from the table . 
  refuse to accept proposals that bring the same income to the ones you propose , if they hurt the big money - like an extra tax on large profits , but instead tax both big and small companies the same way . 
  it 's a very clear message to the people : elect politicians who approve of austerity or the same thing will happen to you . 
  that , above all else , is what is pissing me off about this situation . 
   ~ ~ give ~ ~ * lend * money if the debt is not voided ( and there are no plans to do so at the moment ) , you 'll get back what you lent plus interest . 
  that 's a good gift if there is one . 
  when your time comes and you need a bailout , you will get one , just like other countries did . 
  i 'm sure your country gets money from the eu , just like mine does , and like other eu countries do . 
  and you will continue to receive it while you need it . 
  is it that much to ask that other countries that also need money get their share ? 
  i 'm curious - what makes isil a bigger problem for the uk than for the other states ? 
  so if i lose a leg in an accident i ca n't complain because there are people who have no legs ? 
  the greeks signed it under the threat of going bankrupt , having their economy destroyed and their citizens going through a lot of suffering , which included having no material in hospitals and possibly a food shortage . 
  they are in a very bad place and i ca n't fault them for signing it , just like i ca n't blame germany for signing versailles - but let 's not forget that versailles eventually led to wwii . 
  now this would make for an interesting situation . 
  all those finance ministers need to secure a job with one of the big ones before they leave the government . 
  this . 
  ^ making a country `` pay the price '' for their disobedience is the worst thing they could have done . 
  the eu was supposed to be a union for countries to help each other and prevent another war in europe , not to fuel hatred and prejudice . 
  nothing good will come out of this - and at worst the prejudices that this crisis is enhancing will result in another war in europe in 20 or 30 years . 
   there is a physicial difference . 
  the roma are from north western india originally , and look like a mix of 1/4th indian + 3/4th european . 
  what does an european look like ? 
  not in theory , but in practice we all know how it works . 
  what you said does n't invalidate this :  they will find help from another countries like russia the money has to come from somewhere . 
  and i believe leaving the eu is not as far fetched as some may think . 
  especially on the aftermath if greece indeed leaves the ez . 
   had to stand the whole way one journey , on a hot day in the summer , as there were no seats and people were sitting in the corridors , near the doors etc. 
  i thought this was normal for every country , at least on rush hour ? 
  if not , i 'd like to trade this portuguese transit system for a non-crowded one , thanks . 
  was n't this the way it worked a few years back ? 
  what about the old men with their barriga de cerveja ? 
  i had the impression that the prices have been decreasing in the recent years . 
  it still takes away most of the pension if you have one of those low 200-300 $ pensions . 
  yes , and the worse part of this is that the buyer knows you need the money fast , so he might make a lower offer than he would make if he was buying a cow from another place . 
  the same privatization is being done in portugal and i believe we will greatly regret it in 10-15 years , just like today we regret giving money to our fishermen for them to burn their boats 20 years ago . 
  i thought no one took the daily mail seriously . 
  in portugal the price increases with the cubic meters you use ( may vary depending on the city though ) . 
  for me it 's : 0.52 $ / m ^ 3 for the first 5 cubic meters 0.97 $ / m ^ 3 for the 6th-15th cubic meters 1.74 $ / m ^ 3 for the 16th-25th cubic meters ... and no idea after this . 
  then you multiply this number by like 2.5 to account for taxes and water treatment fees and you get your final bill . 
  if i just take the total value/1000 liters i get 2.65 $ / m ^ 3 . 
  i 'm not sure about other countries , but we have plenty of h&m stores in malls here in portugal , along with zara , massimo duti , etc. 
  fair enough . 
  but if my country must resemble either china or the us , i 'd prefer the us ...

  i had horrible experiences with these . 
  from insults to brutal death threats like beheading and physical intimidation . 
  man , they had public school small children engaging in hate rallies in class . 
  how can you or anyone apologize this kind of behavior ? 
  how are those people still here and free to roam around europe ? 
  does it offend you ? 
  it offends me that you seem offended by such a juvenile prank . 
  just shows how backwards and unacceptable religion is . 
  one of these days , you 're going to become a victim of something truly heinous . 
  in the end of your awful experience , tea and cookies will be served . 
  what can you do then ? 
  the police wo n't help and the media wo n't care . 
  even the community will ignore you and probably judge you if you try to make a fuss about it . 
  welcome to islam , or better yet , welcome to the uk . 
  that 's also the same logic behind rapists marrying their victims . 
  i meant reaching this far without resistance or intervention . 
  as if giving tea and biscuits clears anyone from serious wrongdoings . 
   more than a dozen sources disclosed how children at one supposedly non-religious primary school , oldknow , were led in anti-christian chanting by one of their teachers at assembly . 
  unbelievable that this happens and nothing is done about it , most likely out of fear . 
  also , makes you wonder what happens inside mosques . 
  in fact , it 's been reported by undercover journalists that hate speech and even terror workshops are held regularly ... 
  everything is stormfront nowadays . 
  hell , this sub is more stormfront than stormfront . 
  and that 's getting really old . 
  `` youths '' ... 
  nobody gives a damn anymore . 
  and this just shows it can happen in your own backyard and nobody will care . 
  so , governments better start stocking up on weapons of mass destruction and live in paranoia . 
  i bet this configuration will be a great nesting ground for political extremists . 
  proof that there ca n't be a rational discussion about immigration . 
  portugal , also a catholic country , suffers from this as well . 
  what 's worse is that families do n't allow the deaths be written by the coroners or police as suicides . 
  out of shame or denial , obviously . 
  the statistic is likely much higher than what it is . 
  an entire generation thrown under the bus . 
  left to utter precariousness and misery , apathy and depression . 
  a majority of them unable support themselves , carry on with their studies , get jobs , have kids and start families . 
  quite far from the way of life sold by the media and advertising industry . 
  disregard it being zerohedge . 
  it checks out . 
  and prepare for a euro devaluation . 
  ww2 era wmd 's were hardly wmd 's by today 's standard . 
  fire bombing was much more damaging and deadlier than any nukes back then . 
  these were the true wmd 's . 
  and fire bombing became a regular practice . 
  we ca n't really compare the world today to that of 70 years ago . 
  we have technology to easily develop 100 megaton bombs ( twice the yield of the infamous tsar bomba ) . 
  once that drops on a country , it 's game over for whoever is on the ground . 
  precision bombing may even begin in the early stages but that soon goes out the window , given their expense and over reliance on ground intel . 
  then , in come the big boys . 
  i wanted to avoid classic examples , but hitlers orders were to destroy cities on their retreat . 
  recent wars have left all infrastructure destroyed beyond any kind of use to rebels or even the locals . 
  in vietnam , during the war , the policy was to destroy anything that could be used by the vc army . 
  in syria , for example , whole cities and neighborhoods were razed to the ground upon retreat . 
  taliban in afghanistan have destroyed cultural heritages and infrastructure on their way out . 
  in mali also . 
  israel consistently bombs essential palestinian infrastructure , whether it is schools , hospitals or factories . 
  georgians shelled hospitals and infrastructure in tskhinvali . 
  the balkan wars also involved heavy destruction , particularly near the end . 
  it 's hard to give better examples with heavier weapons like nukes because we have yet to get there . 
  but i have no doubt it would be considered and probably used . 
  hate and recklessness are all too present in modern warfare . 
  conventions are signed and put to use in small conflicts or during peace time . 
  in a all out war , anything goes . 
  the aim is to inflict maximum damage/suffering on your enemy so as to end as quickly as possible . 
  some even consider it to be a humane approach . 
  logical insanity as dan carlin puts it . 
  here 's a thought . 
  the losing side usually considers using them . 
  imagine some dictator and his regime knowing his days are numbered . 
  he could go out in a spiral of violence and death . 
  look to history . 
  of course not . 
  germany and france will even provide the weapons for the grand assault . 
  the oligarchs and eu bureaucrats will fill their pockets and eu citizens get the short end of the stick . 
  probably get sent to some gulag . 
  the eu is a sad joke . 
  far too corrupt and morally bankrupt to actually do anything for the interests of it 's citizens or it 's principles . 
  bring on them down arrows !, 
  at least i 'm not delusional about reality and facts . 
  send them to germany and further north . 
  maybe it was prayer time in sweden . 
  or during ramadan . 
  you ca n't blame the poor swedes . 
  values ? 
  do n't you mean value ? 
  and more subject to road violence , theft and serious injuries . 
  i 'm a cyclist but it 's a horrible world for bike commuters . 
  do n't forget that a weak ruble means cheaper gas . 
  germany will profit if this drags for years . 
  a cold war is what merkel wants . 
  kids are expensive . 
  daycares are expensive and difficult to get into with meager incomes . 
  it 's also corrupt as hell and * a personal favor * must be involved somehow . 
  everything is ridiculously expensive for a single person , let alone people with kids . 
  kids are high maintenance and companies frown on people with kids . 
  vat is max value for kids stuff , like food , baby cars , etc. 
  every daycare , like any government center or school/college is loaded with administratives , doing god knows what . 
  much much more than 20 years ago . 
  that 's why tuitions/costs are pornographic and getting something to change is impossible .

it 's more about the mouth with full of red paint ? 
  that looks blood . 
  man the portuguese girl is wtf to me never seen one like that here . 
  looks like an angolan impregnated a kurd . 
  romania looks like a vampire . 
  sounds fitting . 
  that does n't really look like an average portuguese woman . 
  pepe is a dead meme . 
  did they find any ? 
  before morocco it was us who owned those places . 
  will be interesting to see putins reaction to this . 
  i guess both won in the final against the host ? 
  i think portugal and greece are closer to each other than spain . 
  but i might be wrong . 
  ca n't wait to read his piece of literature in the radio . 
  what, 
  portugal would be the kid who had a great life in elementary : great grades and popular among everyone . 
  but now he is just depressed with shitty grades . 
  i am not a right winger . 
  but it is worth pointing that the paper says that there are ` smarter ' people in the fars ( right and left ) . 
  but ultimately says that right wing people tend to be more ` simple ' . 
  great paper by the way i will use it to annoy some friends right now . 
  in the end of the video they killed with a shock i think . 
  i think the shock is the common humane way . 
  but why the boiling alive at the start ? 
  why ? 
  that 's awful . 
  do n't they have more humane ways of killing than being boiled alive ? 
  wait until you actually get elected ,, 
  whats the deal in corsica ? 
  that works too . 
   '' she did refer -- briefly -- to a referendum on eu membership in her closing statement , but not to ditching the euro . '', 
  that 's not that bad . 
  maybe she is starting to see the eu is not the real enemy out there . 
  while we dont consume much out coffees are really strong and should count as 3 coffes per coffe making us top the list . 
  we just do n't have jobs . 
  but we have immigrants from mainly angola , cabo verde and brazil . 
  hahaha that 's true . 
  i do n't think we need to side with anybody we are n't going to war , are we ? 
  ca n't say you guys have n't already tried !, 
  i am ok with this as long as they give us even more money . 
  the original lyrics said :  for the fatherland , fight !, 
  against the ** british ** , march on , march on !, 
  instead of :  for the fatherland , fight !, 
  against the ** cannons ** , march on , march on !, 
  because even though we were allies at the time they were stronger than us and issued an ultimatum demanding that we gave them the territories between angola and mozambique . 
  the hymn was created as patriotic protest to the decision of accepting the demand . 
  low birthrate and net loss in imigration . 
  in a blink of an eye we will have less population than the likes of luxembourg . 
  i am really enjoying hamon . 
  also now i can see why people still vote for fillon he brings security with his words . 
  le pen 's arguments seem like a disc on repeat . 
  macron is doing alright . 
  melechon looks really respectable . 
  yeah i mean just as a start calling portugal euphoric ... 
  when someone writes n\u00e5 !!, 
  with 2 exclamations marks it must be hard guessing what he is saying . 
  they would have to massively decrease their dependence in oil exports . 
  i agree with the austrians . 
  they used to rule portugal as long as we had power in the advisors or parliament ? 
  or something like that . 
  then felipe iii came into power and kicked the portuguese out of those roles , angered the country and lost the battle . 
  funny fact is that when we restored the independence we almost became a merchant republic . 
  why does luxembourg gain so much ? 
  i always thought that she had potential but at the moment she is just encouraging violence exactly the opposite of what she is saying in this video . 
  she just seems out of touch with the reality . 
  would n't porto to horta be farther ? 
  i agree . 
  / r/europe makes me feel genuinely happy . 
  the us is only 27 % ? 
  that was unexpected . 
  [ yeah , portuguese is the best example . 
  a peaceful civil war with no casualties to end the dictatorship also known as carnation revolution . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carnation_revolution ), 
  the invader would lose . 
  without us you would n't exist . 
  always wondered what the native americans would be like today if we left them untouched . 
  i heard somewhere that the vegetarian option requires a registration so the schools can change the number of meat meals and vegetarian meals . 
  what conflicts happen in bosnia that dont happen in serbia and albania ? 
  they have a really cool hymn . 
  you should check portugal !, 
  macron gets some fillons as well . 
  paris is still a lovely city . 
  you guys are probably confusing with the portuguese napole\u00e3o boaparte, 
  fair enough , i deleted my comment . 
  but i would argue trump supporters see things that do n't exist . 
  i have a friend who is a trump supporter and says lisbon is being also overrun by muslims and i 've never seen a muslim in lisbon . 
  no , thanks !, 
  do n't forget to stream !, 
  atleast one of you !, 
  some things in the eu need to change and i hope fillon/macron and schulz/merkel have something in mind . 
  i think the main reason they worked together was the general idea that selling the main public companies was a step in the wrong direction to the portuguese in both short and long term . 
  passos coelho was still able to close tap days after the election which i think was a major reason they joined forces . 
  ireland and france are real horndogs . 
  sweden is now considered a capital ? 
  pink map and occupation of portugal after the napeolonic wars come to my mind . 
  kinda of a shitty ally tbf, 
  quite a old video but i am always fascinated by how influential we were . 
  sweden has twice our gdp . 
  we closer in size with greece or ireland .

  why are you being discriminatory against africans ? 
  would it be fine if instead of africans it was for example poor portuguese or poor magdeburgians the ones living off your welfare money ? 
   who needs enemies when italy is your friend ? 
  people are downvoting you because you 're supporting your claim . 
  what a bunch of hypocrites . 
   a fundamental understanding of economics is something only americans have knowledge of ? 
  yeah ... quite the opposite , for the most part american redditors are a bunch of retards who go on reddit complaining about capitalism when they 're wearing designer clothes and posting their nonsense from some ipad . 
   because your comment is misinformed and stupid , and openly displays your ignorance . 
  ( ... ) havent had anyone ( except in iceland ) http://studiotendra.com/2012/12/29/what-is-actually-going-on-in-iceland/ there , who 's ignorant , misinformed and stupid now ? 
  `` hurr durr banks are evil '' , what a moron . 
  all these downvotes i 'm getting . . 
  i should have known better than to post this late at night when europe goes to sleep and the americans wander about thinking things in the eu are like they are in the usa . 
   the problem is corruption on higher levels , public works . 
  unfortunately , you 're right . 
  sadly , the man on the street is the one who votes for the guys up top and there are plenty of examples where people knowingly vote for corrupt politicians . 
   do you know how fractional reserve banking works ? 
  by lending out the money they receive , like always . 
   do you have any idea how much fraud the modern day financial industry has committed , and continues to commit , to this day ? 
  protesting against that is the same as protesting against thieves and arsonists , it makes no sense whatsoever . 
  that 's not solved through protests , that 's solved with a more effective legal system . 
   have you any idea how investment bankers are essentially conning us , and by us i mean anyone with any connection to stocks , mutual funds , pensions , or bonds ? 
  if you do n't like the service a bank provides , do n't deposit your money with them . 
  if you do n't like any bank , keep your money under the mattress or cut the middle man and loan it yourself . 
   nah , much easier to write some stupid pithy comment that contributes less than nothing to the conversation . 
  go back to youtube . 
  said the person that 's angry against the system because `` hurr durr bankers are evil '', 
   protesting is not part of our culture . 
  really ? 
  well , i sure am sick and fucking tired of those , here it seems like `` oh , another strike ? 
  it must be tuesday ! '', 
   even the protests against austerity were small , and most of the country is against it . 
  pretty much all of the country is against it , the thing is that there 's no alternative , nobody was willing to continue lending us money so that we could continue to pile on the debt , so protesting against this is like protesting against too much rain . 
  the only ones who keep on striking are the idiot communists who think if we just taxed more or if we just printed money that we 'd be able to keep on spending and the damned unions who are seeing their monopoly rights curtailed and hate the idea of less funding and more competition despite that being what 's best for the country . 
   and our catholicism is very weak , most catholics do n't go to church even on `` missa do galo '' . 
  that much is true , i 'll give you that , nobody actually cares , people just go about their own beliefs and it 's great that way , there 's no annoying religious / anti-religious people around and it 's a private issue . 
   hate speech is n't , or at least should n't , be considered the same as free speech . 
  nothing good , productive or in any way useful comes out of hate speech and there 's no logical reason for it to receive any sort of attention that is n't in the lines of ` shut the fuck up ' . 
  replace `` hate speech '' with `` criticism of the authorities '' and your argument is just as valid . 
  the problem is where you draw the line and with regards to freedom of expression , there should be none . 
   just because someone has an opinion does n't mean it deserves to be heard . 
  saying you 're for free speech but then saying some of it ( the bits you do n't agree with ) should be forbidden is highly hypocritical , that 's not free speech at all , even the most ruthless of tyrants would agree to that !, 
  it 's not free speech if you 're not allowed to express yourself freely , no matter what you say and no matter who might disagree with you . 
   the privately owned media do n't have a duty with democracy . 
  and the state-owned media is often a weapon against it . 
   protest bankers lol , if you do n't like what they do , then do n't lend them your money . 
   there are lots of catholic in france , for one thing . 
  they also say that about portugal and we legalised gay marriage without problems . 
   what 's next ? 
  people complaining about racism on r/europe and reminding us we should n't discriminate against muslims just because some of them carry out these terror acts . 
   he is no longer among us . 
  to the mod team : things were so much worse back when everything was allowed and the community regulated itself through upvotes and downvotes . 
  thankfully things have changed and now it 's you the ones decide for us what we should and should not read . 
  thanks for ~ ~ censoring ~ ~ moderating this subreddit , you 're doing r/europe a valuable ~ ~ dis ~ ~ service . 
   neoliberal is a troll . 
  ignore and move on . 
  `` i disagree with him , hence he must be a troll '', 
   he will not condemn the killing of lee rigby because he does not consider him innocent . 
  yeah , not being a radical muslim must make you guilty of something . 
  on the other hand , beheading people with machetes must be fine ( that is , if you do it in the name of the right god ) . 
   i 'm not saying it 's a bad thing to question governments , institutions and what not really . 
  it 's good to question silly bullshit like this . 
  but if one is going to use it as an argument against their existence i think they should bring something different to the table . 
  the thing is that this kind of nonsense should not even be an issue , do n't people think twice about the things they 're proposing ? 
  the argument seems to be that this type of crap should n't even exist . 
  that it needs to become a public scandal so that it 's avoided means that there 's something wrong with the current political system - and this is a quite pathetic example , we 've had plenty of other incidents ( some of this kind , others more serious ) where people within the eu act as if they 're completely disconnected from the people they 're meant to be representing . 
   it was a proposed law nothing more ... why every other idiot got riled up about it is a mystery to me . 
  because if nobody got riled up , it would pass and become law . 
  do n't click , it 's a virus . 
   question , could anyone see russia ever joining under any circumstances ? 
  if it 's about assuring the free movement of goods , capital , services , and people , i 'll support it . 
  if it 's about letting brussels regulate and control the economy , fuck no . 
  as of now , i have no passion left for a united europe . 
   with the eurozone we already have free trade ( pretty much ) have we ? 
  did we forget about cap and cfp and all the regulation and restrictions on foreign trade ? 
  we 're going full-steam in the wrong direction , the eu is just caving in to all and any pressure from special interest groups and becoming [ highly protectionist ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgp5hiisnjo ) - this is the opposite of what it was meant to be and it 's an eu i simply refuse to support . 
   a good example is ukip 's immigration policy , which requires any immigrants to be fluent in english ... my own country requires me to be fluent in english , at least it 's part of the national curriculum here , what 's wrong with that ? 
  are you telling me immigrants in the uk do n't have to and should n't have to learn the language of their country ?? 
   conservatives and poorer people that 's stupid , most of the tory electorate is n't close to being wealthy , and i 'm yet to see the conservatives trying to arbitrarily hurt those who are worse off . 
   labour and the upper-middle class again , that 's nonsense , just because they 're a party that 's for more for interventionism in the economy that does n't mean they 're out to harm those who happen to be better off . 
  anyway , the policies labour often tries to pursue do inevitably lead to higher inequality and more difficult social mobility , and that 's a good thing for those who already have it good . 
   ukip supporters are the type to screw over a huge number of people because it had n't occurred to them that these people might exist . 
  so ukip enforcing the usage of the english in the uk is trying to screw with immigrants ?? 
  is trying to halt the eu 's creeping control of the economy and the lives of its citizens pretending that x or y group do n't exist ?? 
  that 's utterly ridiculous !, 
   if they 're really out to get in then they could probably just declare themselves part of portugal , bypassing all the other eu states . 
  yeah , about that , we 'd have to accept them first . 
  i mean , i 'm guessing we would , but it would still be odd . 
   probably the freest country in the eu . 
  with regards to civil liberties , perhaps . 
  with regards to economic freedom , not at all . 
  whenever my american friends demonstrate their ignorance regarding europe , i might feel smug and cynically educate them . 
  too bad i have no american friends . 
   if a child consents then there is nothing wrong . 
  looking at your comment history , you 're quite a weak troll . 
  anyway , children and other groups such as the medically insane are n't responsible and therefore ca n't fully exercise their rights - just like they ca n't have a driving license or have voting rights , they also ca n't consent to sexual intercourse or pornography . 
   pedophilia is a sexual deviation , not a crime . 
  just as homosexuality . 
  it 's not their fault that they were born that way . 
  `` it 's not my fault that i was born wanting to rape lousy trolls , sorry u/nutchnig , but you 're about to experience the dick . '', 
  lol nope .

  i have lived in a car . 
  it sucks . 
  it sucked i had a job and still could n't afford all expenses and was n't eligible for any support !, 
  now if only i were a gypsy or some other naturally oppressed minority ... dat welfare !, 
  europe has failed . 
  there 's way too many similar stories here . 
  the excuse of lacking funds or any support grid for these cases are unconvincing . 
  ubiquity of guns . 
  romani gangs and eastern mafias . 
  competing for ripping off tourists , wealthy old expats and also mainly for western europe 's main gateway for drugs , guns and sexual slavery . 
  seeing this put hair on my chest . 
  [ mine . 
  interesting choice of words . 
  muslims * blown * out of proportion . 
  this is why current nuclear power is the biggest stupidity we could embark on . 
  on paper , it 's unbelievably good !, 
  in practice , it 's far too risky and costly to the general population . 
  we ca n't prevent human errors and we ca n't predict earthquakes , tornadoes or any other natural calamity , let alone jihadis and other terror groups from attacking them . 
  if anything happens , land becomes irradiated for centuries ... even those who far away from it . 
  effectively removing kebab since 722 ad . 
  now seriously , people are fleeing the country in droves !, 
  who the hell wants to settle here ? 
  there are no jobs and hardly any evidence or hope it 'll ever get better . 
  i blame people like you for them living like this . 
  with your tags and decrying racist every chance you get . 
  you create the perfect background noise for this to proliferate in the 21 ^ st century . 
  feral children living in squalid conditions growing up to become violent antisocial individuals ... all because of an absurd and criminal form of political correctness , sjw like yourself and of course the racists . 
  romani are gypsies , for the millionth time ... 
  in portugal our gypsies are the same . 
  in northern spain it 's also like this . 
  these people live in squalors by choice . 
  they 're formatted to this by their cultural habits . 
  i recall passing by a `` squalor '' such as this one on my way to work and see many high powered vehicles parked in front . 
  they are also very feral and abusive towards outsiders . 
  they all live on given land and get many subsidies , all the while keeping parallel economies , drug and people traffic and other criminal activities . 
  we ca n't resolve the gypsy issue as it would mean taking us back to the middle ages . 
  might as well pay them what they want and give them free reign . 
  melilla or oliven\u00e7a for instance . 
  whatever it is n't it 's likely nuclear armed and has a nasty attitude . 
  russia should join the eu . 
  they are !, 
  they 're allowing it and even subsidizing it . 
  addressing the issue will land you in jail and label you a racist . 
  submit to it . 
  it 's over . 
  you 're making it a race issue . 
  it 's a continent of origin issue . 
  this mess would n't even happen if it were not for the complete absurdities in immigration policies and policing . 
  then spain should suffer being broken apart . 
  what you 're justifying is absurdity . 
  nothing preventing someone from usurping what is culturally historically and legally someone else 's , particularly when they are in a weak condition . 
  you 're advocating jungle law . 
  it 's the line of reasoning bullies employ and the same logic that will probably end the world somehow someday . 
  i could give you the same reply over and over again . 
  l e g a l i t y, 
  does denmark want scania back ? 
  is there a legal dispute ? 
  because portugal wants oliven\u00e7a back and is legally entitled to it , regardless of genocide and past cultural displacements , which btw failed . 
  spain in its chauvinistic bouts , failed miserably to erase portuguese presence . 
  it is not forgotten . 
  that 's irrelevant . 
  if someone occupies your backyard and stays there , would you use that argument ? 
  take oliven\u00e7a back from spain . 
  just to stir shit up . 
  fuck that . 
  play it in kobane . 
  could be their national anthem . 
  dear god , if the winds blow south , we 're doomed !, 
  it 's not * just * erdogan !, 
  why does everyone insist on dissociating an elected leader from it 's electorate ? 
  he merely reflects the opinions and stances of a majority that elected him . 
  this leads to `` forgetfulness '' , de-responsabilization and other non-constructive issues that lead us all back to making the same mistakes over and over again . 
  turkey is a big country , i get it !, 
  and there are a lot of good people , which are pro democracy and secular !, 
  sadly , they 're not the majority that matters right now . 
  so , islamism is running rampant . 
  violence , incarceration of journalists , blatant corruption and historical revisionism are at an all time high !, 
  all this does makes turkey ineligible for eu accession . 
  were it not a geopolitical prized asset , even nato would do well and sever ties with this turkey .

  one of those retards where the comment says it all, 
  in 2008 lehman brothers public capital injection into the finantial sector happened . 
  lol , actually that 's sad but true . 
  moreover , a federal anti corruption agency would have much more power to deal/face corruption than national agencies . 
  looks like a fair speculation-proof solution , upvoted . 
  sure , i just do n't think we need to go into this level of harassment and more into serious negotiations - and by serious i mean for both parts . 
  now what i do n't like is the false superiority and the arrogance of some people of countries ` holding the wallet ' . 
  i think that 's neither respect for the people of troubled countries , nor for the officials of every country trying to solve this out , nor for the past leaders that fought and worked hard to build the european project . 
  lastly , sure it 's a greek problem , but not all help involves the transfer of money - help could be offered as know-how and fiscal best practices , for example . 
  saying simply ' i do n't care , it 's a greek problem ' i guess , since we 're in a union , is n't for the good of neither greece nor every other country . 
  oh , too bad you did n't think of that before the introduction of the euro . 
  then you should pay war reparations to greece that you , germans , owe greece . 
  afterall greece does n't have fault that you voted for a maniac that blitzkriegd their whole country . 
  there you have , a german problem . 
  if greece is n't germany problem so why there 's a union set in place ? 
  eu do n't work like it is , so or we move to a full monetary and political union or get back to national currencies . 
  yes , because international markets never screw up , like in the lehman brothers case ... oh wait ... 
  the greeks are n't the only ones responsible for the state of things - there 's much more to the story . 
  moreover are we a union or not ? 
  or we are a union or gtfo !, 
  true , constitutional courts are like the citizens last line of defence . 
  downplaying them like this is a dangerous path to take - a path where everything goes . 
  yes the article does n't have that bias , true - it 's more informative and unbiased . 
  i was only refering to the headline - which is the part most people will see . 
  i always find a little uncomfortable when i see sensationalist and biased ** headlines ** like this , imo . 
  i mean , is n't the court only trying to enforce the rule of a law voted by germany citizens , the very own thing it is supposed to do ? 
  this headline portrays the court as a bunch of grumpy old ones spoiling the party . 
  if we ignore our democracy , our values and our beliefs what will be left to fight for ? 
  europe is in dire ( very dire ! ), 
  situation , but i think sacrificing the little democracy there is left should n't be a solution . 
  so there , let the democracy work , wait for the ruling and [ deal with it ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/052/812/deal_with_it_dog_gif.gif ) .

  wow , just realized that 2 years have passed since he wrote/i read that - and we 're pratically in the same spot or worse . 
  just , wow . 
  ( wondering how confidence fairy looks like ... ), 
  yep , i really do n't know what ` signs ' are you talking about . 
  in portugal the deficit just increased to higher levels than last year ( when we had the bailout ) , the internal demand and economic activity is speeding it 's way down - thanks to wage cuts , which due to the deficit fiasco could happen again this year - , external demand is slowing , so i really do n't see what ` signs ' you 're talking of . 
  and last time i checked irish economy is n't exactly taking off as projected . 
  i dunno about you guys but i loved the pun . 
   cheers , mate . 
  sure , no probs . 
   if you look at it i think it 's a us like dual chamber : one where citizens are proportionally represented and one where states are equally represented , like today 's council and us senate . 
  the problem of today 's eu council imo is that it only have the heads of state ( only one per country ) and that does n't quite reflect the political diversity of that country , it should be like 2-4 eu council members per state imo . 
  this is stupid . 
  period . 
  nope , i think they only appoint the 2nd chamber . 
  i mean the ` alentejo ' region is all good - the food is probably the best in portugal too . 
  i do n't know much about the spanish coast but the ` alentejo ' coast / ` costa vicentina ' is a top also - it 's the southwest coast of portugal . 
  have fun !, 
  trudat , same goes for portuguese . 
  * facepalm *, 
  lol , what 's this supposed to be ? 
  euro cup ? 
  yields ? 
  ca n't find the pattern . 
  i told you ... here come the bond vigilantes/crooks : [ spain 's benchmark bond yield hits euro-era record on bank deal angst ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/12/markets-global-idusl5e8hce8e20120612 ),

  meanwhile ... `` 2010 is calling , he says he needs this thing fast ! '', 
  imo , i think it makes more sense for the irish to be fairly annoyed at this - since it 's a similar situation , banking bailout - than the greeks and the portuguese ( state bailout ) .

  momma says it 's ok being special !, 
  o que ? 
  i must have made myself not clear . 
  what i meant to say was why would you venture yourself in the usa airports ( i was hoping that would be clear from the links i posted ) , when they are known for being so idiotic and draconian in an irrational way . 
  if they reply , please post their response here . 
  well , my country is with 30 % youth unemployment and the government is having a hard time liberalizing employment , it 's still easier to shut down a factory than it is to fire 5 unproductive workers , it would be really helpful if the unions did n't had so much power and did n't go on strike every time the government tries to revitalize the economy . 
  but the unions have way too much power and only care about themselves and those they represent , they do n't give a shit to those unemployed or the rest of the society . 
  but yes , this is more of a national problem than it is an eu one , other than showing their support for the legislation trying to be put through , there is n't much the eu can do . 
  `` a new animal along with the piigs in its farm '' ? 
  not really , no . 
  as if the germans were the only ones to commit murder in a large scale even inside the eu . 
  it never will . 
  lol at them trying . 
  the influx of people from the middle east entering europe would be too much , and their culture is just too different from ours , though converging , will not anytime soon be exactly attrition-free . 
  politicians just go with the economical excuses and they still try to represent the ottomans and justify their treatment of the armenians , so they have it easy . 
  in short , it would be much more trouble than it is worth it , at least for now that 's how things are . 
   i did n't expect more than this in this subreddit , though . 
  on r/atheism . 
  i have to say , it 's actually quite funny , at least imo . 
  but what do i know , i also find this very topic funny . 
  it 's a joke , the title could be changed to pretty much any other eu country and it would still be valid , it 's the internet , do n't take so seriously . 
  why would they ever want to visit the usa in the first place ? 
  [ l.a. food stylist pulled from flight for ` atom bomb ' tattoo ] ( http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/dailydish/2010/11/la-food-stylist-pulled-from-flight-for-atom-bomb-tattoo.html ) [ tsa pat-down of a 3 year old ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn6pj7np1ya ), 
  eu countries currently having financial issues , which by the way are not limited to portugal , ireland , italy , spain or greece . 
  but i guess if it was something like ukpiigs , for instance , it would n't have the same ring to it . 
  do n't take this the wrong way , i fully agree with you in that the eu should be more unified and be independent from the usa just as it is from anybody else , but what do you mean when you say that we 're just a collection of small entities that take orders from them ? 
  it 's not like they 're bullying us over our lunch money , pressuring our politicians to cave in to their demands or asking us to join them in invading more arabic countries , or that they 'd act that much differently towards us if we were an united states of europe . 
  what do you mean ? 
  multiculturalism is about the government promoting minority cultures , which is exactly the opposite of non-intervention . 
  i agree with pretty much of what you said but i fully disagree about # 7 . 
  multiculturalism is often nothing but problems , either by causing resentment towards minorities or these minorities trying to impose their will on the rest of society . 
  i 'd rather live in a society where the government does n't try to promote any culture . 
  windows ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that was bill gates ... 
  this is most definitely related to [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/oull7/europe_is_considering_a_sweeping_new_law_that/ ) . 
  i can confirm this . 
  that article was bullshit . 
  it 's actually quite clever indeed . 
  if there were european rednecks , i 'm pretty sure they 'd sound like that . 
  i there 's one thing i love in you guys is your sense of humor . 
  at least according to portuguese law , you 're mistaken . 
  considering that our law is largely derived from german and roman law , i would be very surprised if we were the only country that could prosecute criminals for crimes they have committed in other countries . 
  personally , i agree with this , rather than extraditing suspected criminals to the us and other countries , it would be for the best if we just adjusted our laws if we have to so that they can be prosecuted in their own country . 
  you do n't need the extradition treaties to nail them , nor should you need them . 
  you can prosecute criminals in your own country . 
  it 's not . 
  sarcasm aside , that 's exactly what the far left parties and unions want . 
  and they 're the most vocal group , at least here . 
  fortunately they have never won and hopefully never will win the elections . 
  their unemployment severely increased with the housing crisis and now the difficulty in getting credit , as they had a lot of people working in civil construction and now almost every project is in stand-by . 
  i honestly do n't care . 
  if those idiots do n't know about our existence , let them , it 's not like it would be beneficial if they did . 
  is that the flag of angola ? 
  why does it say antarctica ? 
  you forgot the part of the extreme stereotypes , like the french with the baguettes or the british coldstream guards . 
  i 've never heard about that saying , but if you say so , i guess . 
  good grief , this is an union of 27 countries , why give such relevance to the current uk vs germany/france debate for europe ? 
  if we 're ever going to further our integration even more , these nationalistic petty arguments really need to stop , they are only good for driving us apart . 
   welcome to the fourth reich fucking really ? 
  when we compare the mess we 're in to what 's happening in other countries ( usa and ows , russia and their elections , the arab world and the revolutions , china and their population working conditions ) , we are indeed not bad at all !, 
  sure , there 's room for a lot of improvement within the eu , it 's just than when it comes to the uk , it often seems you 'd rather just give up than continue to work for a better future . 
  but then again , what does the uk have faith in when it comes to the eu ? 
   but that 's what modern democracy is all about !, 
  corporate interest is what really matters . 
  this is n't the usa . 
  democracy here is n't only two parties with a chance to win and both favoring corporations . 
  as a side note , i 'd be much more scared if it were the communists getting their way most of the time rather than the corporations . 
  as for the eu council , it still has to go through parliament and those were elected democratically , so i doubt it will pass . 
  godwin 's law much ? 
  unfortunately ... 
  it would be really helpful if you could determinate what it is . 
  the blame is n't of the people directly , it has been their governments that were to blame . 
  greece did many many things wrong , they never got used to losing the drachma and they continued to live like they did during the cold war when they were an important exchange intermediary and had full control over their currency . 
  that and the general government waste that provided subsidies for everyone and everything . 
  such mismanagement of money is obviously a recipe for failure . 
  portugal never did things as bad as greece and at least did n't try to hide its debt like the greeks , but still , mistakes were made and money no longer grows on trees ( or should i say , it still does but the tree is in brussels ? ) . 
  you ca n't blame it in anyone in particular , you certainly ca n't pick us a greek , portuguese , british or german from the street and say `` it was him ! '', 
  but it does n't really matter now , does it ? 
  at least it 's what i think , that the priority now is to fix this and prevent it from happening in the future rather than pointing fingers and scapegoating others . 
  the inflation rates between both countries is very similar , the goal is for it to be 3 % year . 
  i do n't get it , how is the ecb trying to harm us . 
  ( as a side note , i 'm in my first year of university , getting a degree in economics in universidade do porto , so i 'm genuinely interested in learning more about this . ), 
  what ?? 
  the inflation as been really low in germany but so has also happened in portugal !!, 
  in fact , in 2009 , portugal even had deflation !!, 
  http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/inflation-cpi http://www.tradingeconomics.com/portugal/inflation-cpi, 
  when you consider that we got to the point that our own state only had money to pay for salaries and pensions for one more month , all that goes down the drain . 
  yes , we did wasted a lot of money . 
  would it be fair if the situations reversed ? 
  ( ex : portuguese people from the continent having to pay for the fuck ups of the madeira government without any accountability there ? ), 
  i do n't think so . 
  the germans clearly are n't in this for the money . 
  i do n't know or care if it 's guilt or pure interest on an european union or whatever , but what i do know is that they 've already invested a lot in this and that they are not going to get all their money back so soon , if they 're even going to get it all back at all . 
  i personally do n't view it as slavery , i view it as paying for the crap we did in the past and doing our obligation of paying what we owe . 
  it wo n't kill us and it will only teach us a lesson , hopefully now we 'll learn from our mistakes . 
  i do n't want to sound too harsh but while calling us piigs is n't really helpful , we whining because we do n't want to pay for the mistakes we did and the loans we took is n't also good . 
  take it easy , man . 
  saying stuff like gtfo and then complaining about downvotes is n't really going to help you achieve anything . 
  nobody is saying the current $ issue is uk 's fault , but is n't it still fair to ask for the uk 's help ? 
  i mean , if the uk had problems of its own , the rest of the eu would certainly help , it 's why we 're in a union , is n't it ?

i 've been to koln and i really liked that city and have been considering the suburbs nearby for a long time . 
  but i do n't know , when i get the chance to move , maybe things will be more difficult for emigrants and all . 
  i got ta be honest : we 're on the other side of the continent so the only refugees from syria i have knowledge of came on a plane and in a considerable low number . 
  i think that most of them are young adults that came to study so i do n't even know if they 're part of this big wave of people coming . 
  but days ago on the news , it was pointed out that some villages in portugal are ready to receive refugees ( not in high numbers , maybe tens of them ) and well , they interviewed a woman who was all pissed off because she 's worried about the houses that are for sale in her town being occupied by migrants and decreasing the value or something . 
  besides of my finance teacher , who claims how lucky we are and how these people want to the same opportunities to study and work i 've honestly not heard a lot of opinions . 
  share debt problems , really ? 
  when countries like greece hid the real numbers for years and had the public sector milking a lot of money without regard to efficiency i do n't think that it 's fair making everyone pay for it . 
  not all countries can handle as many migrants as germany but portugal , for example , can handle some of them . 
  edit : but yeah , i still agree that when germany 's open door it 's what 's bringing more migrants . 
  australia, 
  my only opinion about georgia comes from eurovision . 
  so the greeks are able to afford toyota ? 
  or is this the big last investment for the next ten years ? 
  i 'll be in dijon ( universit\u00e9 de bourgogne ), 
  i 'm actually lucky that my university got most things online but still , not as fast and convenient as ireland . 
  thank you for the heads up regarding the administrative processes in france . 
  about the formality and hand a sheet to professors , that 's just like in portugal . 
  well , now i feel a bit more prepared . 
  thank you !, 
  yeah , probably . 
  they only point out things like the agriculture that suffered with the quotas and how salazar made a better job with the portuguese economy . 
  i 'm not saying that they 're lying , but i do n't see portugal being much better outside of the eu . 
  my russian friend always told me that the media is the one ruining things for russians in europe . 
  she even told me that black people are perceived as cool and exotic in russia !, 
  i would n't put greece in there . 
  not even portugal . 
  it 's sad to hear about this but it does n't surprise me a bit . 
  even in my country i can find people ( even university students ) that think that portugal would be better off without the eu . 
  their arguments are so stupid that most debates just end with `` i 'll not argue with you , you love eu too much '' . 
  they are in a horrible situation but when i heard about how they took advantage of the social security system it makes me mad . 
  http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb10001424052970203370604577263863362854348 unfortunately , its a cultural thing and i see it also in portugal ( not so much now , thanks to troika and the need to cut expenses , which started a huge search for people that presented fake children and other things to get more money ), 
  so , we could have a change in the regulations for the use of pesticide in products but the thing regarding toys inside food would be untouched ? 
  if we think about the economic impact of kinder eggs , kinda makes sense ... 
  stupid question : would this partnership make the kinder egg disappear ? 
  wow !, 
  it bothers me a lot when they start screaming and crying like they 're the victims ... 
  wow , what a bunch of ungrateful bastards !, 
  true . 
  only this week i found out about the gypsy student in my college . 
  everyone was surprised about it . 
  plus , he got into college with a very high grade ( 17 out of 20 ) and when erasmus application came along , he was in the top 10 of applicants . 
  i work with gypsy kids every weekend and i can tell that he was n't raised like the kids i engage with . 
  if a kid is successful in school and the teachers tell the parents that , instead of making the kid drop out , they start to make him miss classes with the `` we 're poor and we need his help to sell stuff in the street market '' . 
  then the kids fails school by missing to much and the process repeats itself until they get him married . 
  edit : word, 
  neither did i. 
  we ca n't get it right , ahah !, 
  i thought i was watching the show with attention , until i saw people giving 8 , 10 , 12 points to russia . 
  still ca n't remember seeing that performance ... 
  true . 
  they brought their cultures into the music and made it fun !, 
  true . 
  people are taking eurovision too seriously . 
  only israel and a few others brought the good old eurovision acts . 
  plus , now we 're seeing hipsters singing too . 
  shame ... 
  the only muslim i know told me that his sister is married to his cousin and he did n't get why we were surprised ... 
  you 're right . 
  gon na edit . 
  all rapes are equally bad . 
  poor kid . 
  edit : ranted something very stupid and deleted it . 
  he was fifth in nine candidates . 
  the ones that had less votes than him were all university graduates, 
   for a start , you would be downvoted by every portuguese redditor ever i see that you know r/portugalcaralho, 
  integration that will end up with everybody being happy is impossible . 
  i had this in my university residence ... 
  in my erasmus the percentage of girls there was around 80 % for sure . 
  some czech girls ended up disappointed because they did n't have as much sex as they 'd like ... 
  what a delusional prick . 
  can confirm . 
  romanians whooped my ass in an english course . 
  edit : and easily whooped french people asses too !, 
  those numbers for france are bothering me the most . 
  i ca n't believe that the percentage in france is that high . 
  studied abroad there and i was shocked that even the tumblr generation struggles a little . 
  ugh , tell me about it . 
  i 've been here doing my erasmus , and even though i choose france to improve my french , sometimes i really need to speak in english and i was really surprised with how bad some university students are ... shout out to the ones who try hard , tho ... 
  maybe this question is a bit dumb , but i 'm seriously curious if anything would happen to the euro . 
  from what i can gather , the ttip would affect the market access and probably the trade rate between eu and usa . 
  so , would the euro be affected in any way ? 
  hello sub . 
  in two months i 'll be in france for one semester and in the last months i noticed that i ca n't get that much feedback from other people . 
  in my country , people do n't choose france as destination that much since it 's not famous for the parties and such . 
  so , can you share with me your experiences ? 
  i 'd like to say 20 but i only spent around 20 hours in hungary . 
  does it count ? 
  most countries i 've visited have such rudimental used for the atm , i 'd never think that portugal would have one of the most advanced atm systems out there . 
  he just generalised it to `` 2004 enlargement '' . 
  in my opinion it was just too many countries at the same time . 
  even my 12 year old self thought the same , when i learned about it on my school 's european club . 
  de gaulle always knew ... 
  exactly what i thought . 
  just go to south portugal and there 's a some mena looking men in there . 
  they still seem closer to european standards than turkey , nowadays . 
  or maybe i 'm wrong . 
  he 's a disgrace to his greek ( ? ), 
  last name . 
  that 's so nordic .

  that special day where you ca n't eat meat , not even ham but you can eat fish . 
  because they are pussies, 
  it 's a mix of both , you ca n't just run forward and think you can solve your problems just by achieving growth , when the budget deficit was higher than the gdp growth you will be more in-debt next year . 
   interest rates were too high because the markets did n't believe that 's not how it works . 
  that 's exactly how it works , confidence in getting your money back means more people are willing to lend you and the interests are lower ... and the fact that you did n't believe there was wastes in the public sector makes me realize it has been a waste of time talking with you . 
  keynesian economics work if the money is well spent , not just poured into a fabric filled with holes in it , the state was inefficient . 
  and above all , it works when the state can print money or borrow money , portugal could n't do either . 
  ofc austerity does n't make the economy grow but it was needed to fix issues . 
  portugal was running out of money , interest rates were too high because the markets did n't believe . 
  we had to fix a lot in our economy , many wastes , i believe it 's mostly done . 
  unemployment dropped , gdp growing a little , and public debt started dropping . 
  and the deficit is being reduced . 
  people tend to exaggerate ... 
  fact their gdp per capita is higher than portugal , romania , bulgaria , poland etc. 
  people are n't starving in greece , their gdp per capita is higher than portugal ... we did reduce public spending , do your homework . 
  no , i 'm actually socialist , but not from this ps, 
  just answer me this , are you against cuts on public spending ? 
  you realize the government spends too much and needs to be more efficient ? 
  cds is just another option for people who do n't believe in unicorns . 
  psd + ps + cds are known as the government arc for a reason , outside of this are demagogues ... `` let 's restore the salaries , cut the austerity measures , etc '' but they never say where the money for that comes from ... we have seen them at work in 1975 and what they did to the country , they set our economy back 20 years . 
  you are a cry baby , if you ca n't find a job go find it outside the country ... or you expect the state to provide for you ? 
  and who cries about privatizations on the xxi century ? 
  the debt started lowering this year , as predicted . 
  economy is growing a little and unemployment is decreasing . 
  emigration is normal . 
  let 's dug our head in the sand and pretend all is dark . 
  you are the typical portuguese guy who thinks everything is bad and the sky is falling , news to you : you live in a decent country with good public services , good healthcare , good security , good education , etc. 
  `` blabla ca n't wait to get out of here '' , then leave , i 'm personally in angola and i ca n't stand the cry babies that some portuguese are . 
  be is pretty hardcore on my book , nationalizing banks and sectors of the economy is hardcore on anyone book except left fanatics that think it 's ok . 
   there 's certainly an argument that we should honour our debts no-matter what , but personally i do n't buy into it . 
  if your citizens are suffering , then your first obligation is to them , not your creditors . 
  and if austerity is actually stopping you from being able to pay back your debt ( which it is , because cutting government spending slows economic growth , which reduces tax income for the government , and hinders their ability to repay debt ) then it is just not logical to repay that debt . 
  of course there will always be some suffering , but it 's not as bad as some people try to play it . 
  left party is even more vague than communist party ... 
  portugal will pay it 's debts , state debts is to be paid over decades , sometimes nearly 100 years ... austerity is working like the numbers are showing . 
  it depends what you consider communism and what would you call be ? 
  we do n't live in a utopia , states need weapons because there are actually bad guys with access to them . 
  it 's not that simple , first psd+cds are given the chance to form a government . 
  if they fail the left can try . 
  the president left the door open . 
  but he is n't wrong , having a ps government hostage of an anti euro anti eu and anti nato parties is too ridiculous . 
  be and pcp had 18 % let 's not forget this . 
  that 's why i also mentioned the training part , they are equally important . 
  for being power hungry , they lost , costa instead of resigning decided to run forward , this was the time for him to be prime minister and he blew it . 
  europe does n't have oil or gas in decent numbers , and it 's a relatively cold continent so this would be huge . 
  in portugal the president always invites the winning party to form a government , even if they have less than 50 % . 
  there are several examples including with the previous ps government and this same president , psd+cds won the election this time so they were invited to form a government , if the left do n't agree they can overthrow the government and new elections will be held . 
  we will see then who the people will chose . 
  that 's not the case in portugal ... opposition will oppose , even if they know austerity is needed and will implement it when they are in power ( at least for ps , psd and cds ) . 
  the other 2 parties ( be and pcp ) are hard-line communists and are even against nato and eu . 
  we borrowed the money and we have to pay , most people here in portugal agree with this simple thought . 
  so it 's not about being afraid or wanting to please anyone ... it 's about being realistic and honor our compromises . 
  there will be new elections next year and ps is gon na be punished . 
  one could argue that more weapons ( or more/better training ) would have been helpful to stop isis from getting half of iraq and 1/3 of syria ... 
  what about no ? 
  dat circle jerk though, 
  maybe it 's weaponry bought by the pentagon/cia and supplied to rebels . 
  i thought most of the weapons in syria are either soviet or american ... but i guess that way the circle jerk could n't be completed so gracefully . 
  ya one `` witness '' says he saw you that 's not enough to destroy a man 's life ... at the time they also mentioned sampaio , they were trying to frame all the ps ... 
  i 'm not with ps on this one , but let 's be reasonable here . 
  ah i do it right then, 
  lol i say heaven too , what 's the correct pronunciation ? 
  do n't know about italians , but it 's the same with apple , i keep saying ` haaple ' instead of ' \u00e1aple ', 
  because english sometimes is stupid with their pronunciations and illogical . 
  a y and not a e, 
  the one in the op for instance ... 
  i 've seen videos of them just ferrying them back and forth without even someone trying to stop them , just some guys welcoming them . 
  wait for them to unload the refugees , sink the boat . 
  board the ships , jail the crew . 
  and the greek government is doing what exactly ? 
  god damn , british love their horse meat , they do n't know it yet , but they looove it . 
  so did portugal , i 'm sorry too , have always been against it . 
  absolutely disgusting, 
  this just confirms greeks are cry babies, 
   finding out that their third degree cousin 's best friend 's grandma was 25 % portuguese and patting ourselves on the back as if we were responsible for said achievement . 
  i do n't , you think ? 
  ofc a small nation with 10 million will never be able to compete with a nation with the resources brazil has , not to mention the 200 million people . 
  but ask yourself this , would you be rather be the average chinese ( 2nd biggest world economy ) or would you rather be the average german ( 3rd or 4th biggest world economy ) ? 
  on one side you can boast about how you are # 1 in population , the 2nd biggest economy in the world , most relevant country in asia !, 
  on the other side you have healthcare , higher life expectancy , good education and a good place to grow and raise your children ... and quality of life . 
  it 's a matter of perspective . 
  portuguese aproax would be saying `` we suck , oh , how relevant we used to be '' while blaming the politicians, 
  yeah , except in every human index category . 
  not to mention their gdp per capita is half of the portuguese . 
   overtaken `` overtaken '', 
  hollyyy shiitt, 
  on the other hand it 's a pain in the fucking ass to download decent portuguese subtitles . 
  god damnit, 
  he 's from catalonia and is bashing spain, 
  it 's subsidised by the government , like social houses . 
  think chinese ghost towns . 
  came here for them catalonyan comments was not disappointed . 
  angola has huge problems with education , healthcare , social services , security , etc , everything . 
  but still , she should n't be living on welfare, 
  my sister-in-law has gone to france with 2 of her 5 children , she 's living on benefits and her husband will join her now with the rest of the children . 
  they plan on living from welfare for a few months at least , after that i do n't know what 's the plan . 
  they are from angola and here they had several small stores , an apartment they bought for 60k usd and cars worth 80k usd ... 
  i just do n't understand . 
  we still sell them in africa , by the thousands in my stores, 
  it would n't surprise me either , to impose a dictatorship , abusing the insecurity feeling .

  i meant my country . 
  i want my oranges back nonetheless . 
  brother have a hug and a pastel de nata to help you overcome that , 
  apparently also greek and arabic , enough !, 
  i want my country back !, 
   the word for `` orange '' is \u0628\u0631\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644 ( burtuqaal [ remember that we do not have a `` p '' in arabic , and it usually becomes a `` b '' when we borrow foreign words ] ) . 
   in fact , greek has the same difference ( roughly ) in the two words :  orange is \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9 ( portokali )  portugal is \u03a0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 ( portogalia ) source : the internet, 
  romanian , albanian , persian ... edit : persian , not farsi . 
  they use portugal to call oranges in a bunch of languages , we should also make them stop it . 
  my country my rules !, 
  that 's so patronizing and incredibly lusophobic in so many ways ... past\u00e9is de feij\u00e3o are by far a superior choice . 
  you would know that if lusophobia would n't have made you so short sighted . 
  oh so i guess all was fine and non-racist at all then . 
   `` skin racism '' is a western really ? 
  what about slavery ? 
  and why did the ottoman empire banned white slavery before black slavery ? 
  hmm ... 
  funny how not so long ago wanting to host the olympics sounded populistic while nowadays is quite the opposite , not wanting the olympics is the populistic position . 
  in this case i 'm with the populists , organizing the olympics is a complete waste of money and for a city like rome does n't bring any added value . 
  let some new city get some recognition from that , rome does n't need it . 
  dude if you want your view to be respected first you have to give it a fancy name like lusophobia . 
  now it 's ok , you can accuse northerners of being lusophobic , they 'll be scared with the accusation and start thinking on ways to compensate for that . 
  soon sardines and codfish will be available in all supermarkets and loudspeakers will spread fado through the streets of nasty lusophobic northern europe . 
  maybe one day they 'll understand ... 
  it sounded real russian to me lol, 
  problem again is that many are legitimate refugees that ca n't go back home , and are forced to wait for months in these camps without end in sight . 
   if they choose to be resettled in png quite sure that in the case of economic migrants going back home sounds a much better perspective . 
  here , you can [ still catch on with the news ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention ) . 
  and now you 're being lazy and rude . 
  keep on . 
  if you look closely the link you used you 'll find at least 2 , but that 's not the main point anyway . . 
  great , thanks , 
  so many wrong perceptions though on the other ranking . . this reminds me of that one about corruption , where northern countries perceive less corruption than what they have and southern countries perceive much more . 
  stereotypes are powerful stuff . . 
  unfortunately it was removed . 
  maybe you can post it with your translation , 
  is it the same channel ? 
  in that case definitely !, 
  i was not comparing . 
  just noticing the girl priorities : burkini and french riviera , coming all the way from australia . . wow while her country sends syrian refugees to nauru . 
  merci !, 
  i think most people support the policy , it has proven successful , there was a huge drug problem in portugal in the 90s . 
  we just fear all the publicity about it . . drugs are not legal , just decriminalized . 
  on another note , it 's fascinating that an australian family flies all the way from australia over countries like saudi arabia or syria to complain about discrimination in a few french beaches ... 
  fascinating also that this gets covered by an australian channel , the country that sends asylum seekers to concentration camps offshore . 
  [ well ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/53pfyf/australian_tv_channel_fakes_burkini_persecution/ ), 
  you can see [ the complete australian report here ] ( https://au.news.yahoo.com/sunday-night/features/a/32638445/the-moment-a-muslim-woman-is-threatened-for-wearing-a-burkini-on-a-beach/?utm_content=buffer561d9&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer#play ) . 
  however the french newspaper nice matin found some people shown on the report that have a very different version of the events : people complained and kicked out the tv crew for filming children without their parents permission and this was the reason a parent called the police . 
  according to the same witnesses nobody said anything to the burkini-women present . 
   he is probably more of a genuine europhile that 's definitely true . 
  also comparing him with the previous one , barroso , he has 100 % more character and personality ; he 's not just a puppet politician looking for a nice job . 
   i think the overabundance of articles regarding portugal 's drug policy is bound to bring unwanted attention . 
  i fear the same . 
  plus in the meanwhile there are a few countries with similar policies i think , time to report on those . . and remember : drugs are not legal in portugal , you just wo n't go to jail for consuming , but you can go easily to jail for dealing . 
  thanks . 
  merci !, 
  what 's the name of the doc ? 
   so her religion is rude to them ? 
  our customs are rude to her . 
  oh the always renewed islamic fundamentalism ... 
   mainly because it 's disrespectful that 's an interesting point that people tend to forget , at least in the iberian peninsula it 's regarded as impolite and rude not to uncover your head once you 're indoors . 
  i remember seeing once an american guy at the border in the airport getting all annoyed cause the border police was telling him to take off his hat for starts . 
  so this is indeed a strong tradition/social rule , even if people do n't think much about it , it 's just intuitive most of the times . 
  portugal looks depressing ... everyone 's leaving . 
  ah ok , got it , 
  depends on the calendar , often sundays are presented as the first day , which makes more sense . 
  i learned to like it as it 's original . 
  i also have a laugh when often in calendars and [ even in newspapers ] ( http://imagens.publico.pt/imagens.aspx/2016/09/09/publico/publico-20160909.jpg?tp=arquivo ) the days of the week are shortened to the first 3 letters , makes sexta-feira ( friday ) extra fun . 
  once i was showing my calendar to a scandinavian colleague to agree on a date and she asked me `` so you always have sex on the same day of the week ? '' i had a huge laugh when i finally understood what she meant ... ahah it also saves you letters when you want to write them on a sms or something : 2\u00aa , 3\u00aa , 4\u00aa and so on ... 
  the same in portugal , feira is feira , n\u00e3o festival :p, 
  of course they 're not different . 
  they 're just more directly affected by homophobia , which makes it stupid to support homophobic parties . 
  but yeah , gays can be homophobic too . 
  a foreign prisoner is not necessarily a resident , criminals also travel . . 
  oh for christ sake , it 's ukip we 're talking about . 
  get real , that kind of denial it 's what led this guy there and now into full regret/treason ( depending on the angle you see it ) . 
  of course . 
  i 'm a immigrant myself and in favor of migration caps . 
  still i did not join , nor intend to , a xenophobic party . 
  you may not want to see the obvious and you 're free to do so , but the ukip is a xenophobic party . 
  i would write the same thing about a gay in a conservative party ... of course in the end people are free to join parties that advocate against their own rights , but it 's still stupid . 
  forever an indian for the ukip crowd . 
  no chance of ever becoming a brit on their eyes ... 
   how exactly did he do it ? 
  by joining and helping and legitimizing a party that actually promotes xenophobia and racism . 
   within the party , i progressed very rapidly and before i knew it i was sitting in the european parliament in brussels alongside farage and the others . 
  if you think about it it 's actually very easy for someone from a racial minority to become a mascot of some far right party and get a dream job as mep in brussels . 
  all you have to do is to betray the interests of your own people . . but it 's a damn good job . 
  they came directly from west africa to portugal and portugal accepted them and they are well integrated . 
  that question does not apply . 
  sorry my bad , was on my phone and mixed with the other user . 
   as nothing would change . 
  you defend the biggest political change in your country after the wwii and then smilingly state that nothing would change . 
  yep , you 're the dutch farage . 
  will you also apply for a german passport afterwards ? 
  me neither , but that made some sensation on / r/portugal some time ago ... but it 's true that there 's probably less sex these days on day-time tv , i still remember when rtp2 would air sex scenes from some alternative drama series immediately after their children 's programs around 7pm ahahah oh the sweet 90s . 
  or malta , andorra , san marino , monaco ... luxembourg is actually huge among the tiny ones . 
  are you kidding ? 
  they show vaginal plastic surgery on morning tv ... `` re-youthening techniques '' ... 
  you argue in favor of your country to leave the entire legal framework on international trade built during past decades , objectively going into a blank legal area that no one can honestly say how it would be filled eventually ( therefor creating uncertainty and fear with obvious economic consequences ) , and then you go on to simply say that that would not be an issue .

  yeah , because the eu is n't turning autocratic at all ... 
   doing absolutely nothing to prevent the poverty in some part of the population ( that is comparable with africa and ca n't be found anywhere else in europe ) do n't worry , we in portugal , greece and probably others will soon join you proudly . 
  most western countries have less than half the voters showing up and nothing is changing for the better anywhere save a couple of countries . 
  it 's just too late for 4 countries ... ah well , they 're ~ ~ black ~ ~ ~ ~ poor ~ ~ lazy . 
  but really , you 're assuming this is not her ideology and that austerity and trickle down economics is not the plan for europe ; i am not convinced of that at all . 
  yeah , like that works ... she scares everyone into believing that blindly following whatever comes out of brussels is the only thing that could possibly work and should not be questioned ; local governments have little power . 
  eu to merkel : stop destroying the eu . 
  i dislike romani but i 'd still like them to be treated as human beings . 
  they probably have the same ( large ) percentage of assholes as everyone else . 
  they should learn to deal with their inhabitants too . 
  you 'd be paying fees for decades . 
  that or consulting . 
  maybe if you were properly bred you 'd get it ... 
  i do n't know about greece , i know portugal forcibly closed down agriculture and industry . 
  ( yes , we elected weak willed politicians who took the money for their buddies and did n't fight for theircountry ) do you think having a hungry population does n't lead to a revolt that either succeeds or is agressively put down ? 
  russia is a democracy in name , but i do n't want that as a regime . 
  having the supreme court declaring that the constitution is not valid in years of crises , the police declaring a 3 person gathering as illegal , having agents provocateurs , threatening newspapers for publishing corruption news , fining someone who recorded a corrupt transaction and other such actions does n't make for a revolution per se , but is it really the kind of country you want in the eu ? 
  do n't you think that spreads legitimacy of such actions into the richer countries ? 
  or as long as you put a cross every four years in one of tthe german accepted parties were still a great democracy ? 
  and yes , you sounded bigoted , saying only the superior populations should have modern economies with modern industries , everyone else should be content with their barely survivable wages that barely allow them to get to work and certainly do n't allow them to rent ( unless the market crashes brutally ) , and is definitely not enough for privatized health or education which will lead to bigger class differences and potential clashes . 
  maybe a crashing 800 $ a month is a fortune for a western country and people just need to get used to eating 2 meals at best a day . 
  you 're stretching . 
  there 's a lot of assholes here too . 
  but i think acceptance is at all time high , especially since we envy their recent progress . 
  i 'll just say that capitalism and democracy are pretty broad terms that today include complete opposites of their original definitions . 
  so , yay democratic capitalism , but this particular version is quickly turning as bad as what came previously , so a more regulated , transparent etc version is needed . 
  both will be democratic and capitalist , but they 'll be very different , like we are very different from the essays of adam smith and jefferson . 
  no , he makes it sound that the responsible parties are spoiled children that will only change when forced to , and they ca n't be changed from within the country because a two party democracy does n't work that way . 
  which includes forcibly breaking a shit ton of bad contracts , btw , and that wo n't happen by the strength or will of individual governments without a revolution . 
  they didnt make the decision of destroying agriculture and industry , they were destroyed as a condition of joining . 
  ever heard of things like the pac ? 
  do you know much portugal got screwed in fishing quotas ? 
  it certainly were n't the fisherman who wanted to quit , i heard them year after year as they got shafted . 
  did you ? 
  we will turn into paradises following the model of latvia , with a third of the educated youth gone , 23 % gdp loss and no social services , all to pay for your high horse . 
  do you even realize how bigoted you sound ? 
  it will eventually get taken from you anyway because the neo-liberal agenda is completely catastrophic and will spare no one . 
  and that 's if revolutions and wars do n't start happening and the eu and the euro holds , which is more and more likely by the minute . 
  you 've got that so completely backwards i do n't know what to say . 
  people are starving and the eu demands us to keep electing corrupt politicians so they can skim from you to give to banks while waiting that some miracle happens and we magically recover . 
  there 's nothing to say to that worldview at this point . 
  with complete secrecy from the european council . 
  sure ... 
  it 's not about that . 
  well , it also is , but i 'll leave that for last . 
  for a fraction reserve of 10:1 ( the banks borrowing 10 times as much as they get , which is standard for deposits in modern times ) , the economy has to keep expanding around 3 % ( the math is somewhere ) for that money to exist in reality , and that 's exponentially because each year depends on the last . 
  some find that was only possible while exploiting other countries and with cheap power , a situation that is slowly changing . 
  there are financial products that reach 40 , which means that rate of growth must be even higher . 
  as to whether it is lawful , that does n't matter much when they intermingle with governments , especially the us , to the level of writing the laws that govern themselves . 
  as to whether it is harmful , that is quite a debate . 
  i would say it is very much ( at the current level ) , because the expanding/bursting bubbles hurt the poor terribly every time it happens , while the banks get richer and more powerful . 
  i do n't have the models to know how the full impact of things like leveraging , high frequency trading and commodities markets , but at the level they are they are clearly creating bubbles that harm/benefit the same people , for virtually no risk and no work ( economy growth ) whatsoever . 
  in fact , it is equivalent to skimming of the top cents on a huge number of transactions , it adds up . 
  i 'm willing to accept that liquidity is good for an economy , but the levels of inequality , uncertainty , poverty and unrest that are being generated by the level that such methods have achieved are reaching critical levels that can not be dismissed for very long . 
  it would be better to discuss the fact that this financial model is failing at the level of deregulation and unaccountability it has achieved before people start starving and rioting , but states are never clever enough to realize it . 
  we will live in interesting times , but i fear they will be very bloody again because the powers that be are unmovable and the masses are placated until they ca n't eat , and they they get ugly . 
  as for football players , the money they make is pitiful compared to the big bankers . 
  and at least they 're subject to a market , though i hate that they keep passing themselves of as `` sportsman '' . 
  every country has an economy . 
  they will not have an economy to pay a tenth of their debt , especially because it will keep increasing . 
  it 's insane that people keep thinking the debt will be payed after the countries are turned into a 3rd world shithole , or that they miraculously will not have a fascist/socialist/whatever revolution because the 99 % keep getting poorer . 
  it 's a state of mind . 
  i could have rather said to stop trying to control the country like a puppet regime , that 's only the most egregious example i can recall . 
  it was a collusion of interests . 
  i will not defend the plutocrats destroying democracy in every single country , but i will not let the co-conspirators escape the scrutiny either , so that they can place the next puppets to play pretend democracy . 
  people do n't create 40 times the money they receive out of thin air while selling things that are n't real . 
  there is no money . 
  and yes , i do worry about the greeks , europe and the euro , as they near implosion . 
  but it does hurt germany , so it does n't excuse their corruption as the right thing to do for the country , as you said . 
  is it a lie ? 
  do you care about the return of instability , nationhood , fascist/communist revolutions and wars to europe ? 
  because if you do , you 'd do well to start thinking as an european . 
  that 's cute . 
  so , we know the current plan is doomed , but the several uncomfortable for the status quo alternatives are always without merit . 
  people do n't have 40:1 fractional reserves on worthless products . 
  no , goldman sachs , with the full knowledge of parts of germany and the eu , cooked the books for them . 
  and they never will have it in the next 50 years because they will not have an economy . 
  so it 's everyone 's problem . 
  only , it 's getting worse by not getting solved and the euro is likely to disappear next year . 
  `` you '' did n't . 
  some germans did . 
  if you do n't want to be treated as imperialistic , stop acting like it , like saying greece should pay off with it 's island . 
  well , why does n't germany start a european campaign against corrupt rulers , instead of campaigning heavily that voting for non-corrupt `` responsible '' governments is the only way to salvation ? 
  they have said exactly zero about the shady deals that still go on in portugal , they only care about turning our wages lower then china so they can keep the unsustainable financial system afloat . 
   it does n't hurt the german nation i thought the lack of money received was proof enough that that 's wrong . 
  and when someone comes and says they want to clean the country , germany comes with all kinds of bullshit threats , making it a german problem . 
  nevermind the fact that your politicians and the institutions they empower also knew very well how greece was run . 
  nevermind the fact that unless a real solution is found , germany wo n't see the money back . 
  hell , nevermind the fact that the bailout is just a way to funnel money from german taxpayers to their own banks . 
  it 's not their fault because of that , it 's their fault for voting on extremely corrupt politicians . 
  even if we held elections today . 
  this will end terribly , terribly badly for portugal until someone has the courage and the will to rip of a lot of contracts and piss off a lot of rich people . 
  but you can say that about most places , as the financial system is about to colapse . 
  `` it stings even more when you are reminded that these politicians were given a free or cheap ride through university courtesy of the taxpayer and entered a much more penetrable job market . '', 
  you think those politicians entered the job market ? 
  hahahahaha . 
  what does that matter when they can both print however much they want and everyone will loan them money until the system completely crashes ? 
  ( everyone will be fucked then ), 
  quite the opposite , the piigs are not iceland , because iceland fixed itself while we 're drowning . 
  because it 's just laundering money from germans to the german banks and the imf .

  only one of the sides here has it all on the line . 
  why would you ask a hairdresser her opinion on complicated financial matters ? 
  there 's a reason why most constitutions in europe forbid governments from calling referendums on fiscal issues . 
  agreeing to reforms , and putting them into practice ate two very different things . 
  for example , the imf came out with a report a few weeks ago that mentioned portugal as only having achieved 1/3rd of the reforms in the memorandum . 
  i 'll bet you any money greece is in the same boat . 
  of course . 
  greece is the homeland of democracy , so we can have referendums on anything . 
  that 's so wrong . 
  the 2nd bailout has record low interest , much lower than the ones we got in portugal , and still lower than the ones we got right now . 
  they have a much higher debt than we do , but they pay less interest than us . 
  and treaty obligations means we have to lend them the money , its the cost of being on an monetary union . 
  the same cost that greece does n't seem to want to pay . 
  i want a referendum in all eurozone countries asking if we should throw money at greece without no guarantees of getting it back . 
  thing is , can you be in the euro , and not the eu ? 
  well all polls show no as the winner . 
  now the eurogroup should finally gets some balls and refuse any agreement with greece . 
  if they do n't , they 'll just look weak , it would make no sense negotiating cuts and then just giving in out of the blue because of a change in conditions of the other side of the table . 
  whatever happens , this referendum is based on an agreement that has been off the table since wednesday , and greece needs a 3rd bailout . 
  if they do n't want to concede , with the rightful legitimacy to do so , then we should n't have to concede either . 
  the right they have to refuse more measures is the same right we have not to throw endless bags of money into a bottomless pit called greece . 
  you understand that a monetary union would only impact that , if the textiles came from another euro country , yes ? 
  there still is a money exchange , it 's between euro and yuan , instead of lira and yuan . 
  ah dude i 'm done with this . 
  i ca n't put up with this conspiracy theory shit . 
  reailty does n't support my rethoric , i better establish some fucked up theory that will . 
  everyone lies , except for me and those who agree with me . 
  [ sources are extremely easy to find ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-gdp-growth.png?s=gkgnvqq ) [ greece 's own statistics authority ] ( http://www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/esye/bucket/a0704/pressreleases/a0704_sel84_dt_qq_01_2015_01_p_en.pdf ) proves it . 
   after it was proven that the numbers were false ? 
  right . 
  as false as 25 % unemployment . 
  you can choose to deny reality , it 's your own problem , but facts are facts . 
  greece had growth in january . 
  so be it , it 's their choice . 
  if they want austerity , they get to do it inside the euro , inside a controlled environment . 
  if they want insolvency , it 's their own god damn problem . 
  as long as it does n't cost me , i really stopped caring about it . 
  i get the sarcasm , but what they 're doing is `` oh look at me , i 'm stabbing a sword into my own heart so that you feel pain '' they 're overestimating the level of fucks that europe still has to give for greece . 
  were was this , athens ? 
  this far ? 
  the only person that can say that with a straight face would be a 6 month comatose patient . 
  there are facts you ca n't really ignore , samaras left government with a surplus and growth . 
  where has that gone ? 
  the opposite can be said too . 
  would you vote no on an agreement that nobody knows the details and no one agreed to ? 
  that 's why it 's a referendum on the euro , for greece . 
  let me be honest , if the no wins , there 's no way greece wo n't have to print new coin 2 or 3 weeks from today . 
  greece has no market access , no financial aid when the 30th of june expires , and a deficit . 
  so that means that they either come across a golden treasure under the sea , or they have to print coin . 
  since they ca n't print euros , they have to print something else . 
  sure , tsipras does n't want you to know this , because it wo n't suit his `` we want the euro '' rethoric , but everyone knows that this is an implicit euro in or out referendum . 
   forcing greece to leave the euro would be a political suicide . 
  politics 101 . 
  if you ca n't beat them , tell everyone else they 're the bad guys . 
  he 's rallying everyone he can against the troika , because he knows he ca n't win a negotiation , so he rather have everyone think he tried really hard , and then be able to claim its their fault for not getting a deal . 
  either way , it 's forseeable that whichever way the vote goes , syriza is going to go down a really , really bad place . 
  if the vote goes no , then syriza will continue to rule a devastated moneyless country that will be argentina 2.0 , and there will be riots on the streets when people do n't have enough money for food if the vote goes yes , then tsipras will immediately resign , because he ca n't enforce a deal he does n't agree with , plus he would n't have any external credibility anymore . 
  either way , like pilate , tsipras washes his hands from all this . 
  not a doubt in my mind . 
  2 weeks from now , greece will no longer be in the eurozone . 
  we 're looking at a long con here . 
  a great number of syriza supporters always wanted to leave the euro , and they 're days away from achieving their goal . 
  it was indeed the perfect plan . 
  agreed . 
  and i have a strong feeling that the eurozone will fight hard to keep the euro alive , even if it means assisting recovering countries if things go bad for them due to the greek exit . 
  plus , it 's easy to sell at home , it 's one thing having a crisis because of decades of overspending , but it 's another to have a crisis because of another country going bust . 
  well yes , but you were unclear . 
  i believe there will be a crisis in greece , but i doubt it will affect the rest of the eurozone to the same extent . 
   well , we know that there will be an immediate and large scale economic crisis . 
  we do ? 
  that 's some rampant speculation tight there ... 
  true , but if he knows a better deal is impossible , and since he 's dropping the referendum bomb i believe he does , he 's purposefully misleading the people , by giving them a choice they do n't actually have . 
  can we ( anyone else outside greece ) get a referendum that asks us if we want to throw more money at greece without guarantees of getting paid back ? 
  there is n't any home banking in greece ? 
   they are acting should have ended it there . 
  they do n't want this , no one wants this . 
  but he has nothing to lose . 
  if the people say no , then he can wipe his hands clean when greece leaves the euro , beacuse it was the `` implicit will of the people '' . 
  if they people say yes , then his power struggle within syriza will end , and he has an obligation to accept the deal , because the people told him so . 
  either way , if he ca n't govern alone , then he ca n't govern . 
  its not the imf 's job to keep the eurozone alive . 
  make a circle with chalk on the ground , and sell it as a future teleportation spot . 
   i believe promoting the lifestyle in a way that could be deemed influential to minors is illegal but you do n't go to jail for being gay yea , let 's run a scenario here . 
  you gather your family and friends and their kids over for some party , everyone 's having fun , at some point in time you say `` i 'm gay '' and someone rats you out for saying it in front of kids . 
  that wo n't land you in prision in russia . 
  right . 
  you know what , you should go try it out , and let me know what happens to you . 
  seriously , you should do it , and tell your story to the world . 
   any number of motives for that killing  perhaps it was a kremlin inspired killing but why do it there in broad daylight , do you ever think it would be a great way for opponents of putin to cast him in a dark light after all `` who else would have done is '' is the obvious narrative being parroted as a result . 
  coincidences , coincidences everywhere . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the leader of russian opposition , assassinated hours after saying that he feared for his life , died hours later from a coincidence . 
  putin even went as far as saying he ` ld head the investigations , you got ta love his balls , almost like he 's feeding on western hate . 
  unfortunately , that hatred is easily justified . 
   no they have not , they have constantly stated the opposite yea . 
  an ex-kgb agent who is actively expanding his country and upping rethoric against the west , is surely not interested in an political and military state of tension . 
   actually we have lots to gain , a stable supply of petrocarbons in a time of peak oil and declining local supply being the primary one .

   you are equating half of ukraine with all of ukraine i am most certainly not , and i have no idea where that even came from .

  face it the only people that really love the modern arts are the money launderers . 
  yuo must be of genius architect . 
  it 's shit . 
   turks in germany voted 53 percent in favor of the akp , while , mirroring the trend worldwide , second place went to the hdp with 17 percent . 
  the akp was especially strong in western european countries where there is a large turkish diaspora , coming first in germany , france , the netherlands , belgium , austria and norway . 
  at the same time , voters in most arab countries , particularly in north africa , also opted for the ruling party .

  ultimately , this has to be addressed by policy . 
  i think it 's more than fair to argue that european countries ca n't sustain this sort of asymmetrical immigration ad infinitum . 
  exactly , it 's a large enough problem as it is without another year of the same or larger influx of migrants . 
  the problems will only grow if nothing is done to change policy . 
   that was until we saw the temperatures there during summertime , oof . 
  haha !, 
  yeah , our summers are hot , but we always have cold beer on hand to help cool off  as long as you stay away from amareleja ( has the country record of [ 50c during the summer ] ( http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/sociedade/amareleja/vila-alentejana-bate-recorde-e-chega-aos-50-graus ) ) , you wo n't encounter life-threatening temperatures !, 
  the sintra trails you 'll probably enjoy more than the rota vicentina if the heat is not for you , since it has a sort of microclimate separate from the rest of the country ( near the ocean , with a forest ) . 
  i 've done the small trail to the [ palacio da pena ] ( http://www.parquesdesintra.pt/parques-jardins-e-monumentos/parque-e-palacio-nacional-da-pena/ ) by going part-way with the car and cheating ... :p, 
  in my country you might have luck at the estrela mountain range for harder hiking : http://www.roughguides.com/destinations/europe/portugal/beira-alta-beira-baixa/serra-da-estrela/hiking-parque-natural/ also , google for hiking in the minho and tras-os-montes regions where we also have natural reservations and hiking trails there that are popular amongst nationals . 
   edit : just remembered about sintra , it also has hiking trails and a gorgeous natural reservation and historical monuments to boot : http://www.parquesdesintra.pt/en/recreation-and-leisure/hiking-trails/ if you take the castelo dos mouros route , you 'll see one of our oldest fortresses at the peak , the mouros castle which stands since the time of the reconquista, 
   the issue is also that thousands of people gathering on the streets of a major city like cologne would be a big anomaly most times but on nye it is basically expected this is a good point , i agree . 
   trying to compared these two events is irrational beyond belief . 
  i agree with you in part , they are n't entirely comparable , i should have stated it differently : the police have shown they are capable of cracking down on this type of crowd , so i hope they do the same thing if that same type of rapist crowd tries to gather in future . 
  with regard to prior warning , i do n't know how riot police works in germany ; however in my country , if a large unruly crowd is reported our riot police ( corpo de interven\u00e7\u00e3o ) show up really quickly and start cracking skulls . 
  regardless of prior warning i doubt the same crowd of attackers from cologne would have gotten away with such impunity had they tried the same thing in [ terreiro do pa\u00e7o ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pra%c3%a7a_do_com%c3%a9rcio ) . 
   portugal improved a lot on women 's rights and treatment since 1974 definitely . 
  many in the older generations still felt it was okay to hit their wife ; on a job i had previously i saw an old man ask to speak to a guy because he was sure a woman would n't know how to help him . 
  the difference is that our society does n't reinforce this behaviour , and even those people slowly change and soften with time ; maybe they do n't become as `` progressive '' as the younger generations , but our society is n't stuck and fighting for the `` old ways '' . 
  hell we even have gay marriage and adoption by gay couples before germany !, 
  the difference is that this time the police were prepared . 
  other posters here have pointed out that the city 's police had rejected reinforcements for nye . 
   or undercover police acting as agent provocateurs . 
  this i very much doubt . 
  it 's as ridiculous as those claiming that the nye harassers were actually right-wingers trying to stir up hatred against the migrants . 
  since they turned violent , they got the treatment they deserved from the police . 
  that said , i hope the german police take a similar hard stance the next time a crowd of rapists gathers ; the way they responded on nye was disgraceful . 
   the common point is very lowly educated people . 
  a large part of our population is completely uneducated and not is properly used to living in urban areas . 
  no i ca n't agree entirely with this . 
  the common point is the culture ( very backward regarding women ) and religion which reinforces these attitudes and impedes change . 
  my country also had very lowly educated populace until the revolution in '74 ( where people signed documents with their thumbprint since they had no schooling at all ) yet these type of mass sexual assaults were unheard of . 
  i agree on one hand that education does play a role , but its far from being the sole reason . 
   then you 'll have five years to enjoy yourself before your nervous system is harvested for use in the robotics industry . 
  eh ... if i 'm dead i wo n't care either way . 
  my liver wo n't be of much use to them though :(, 
  thanks for that info !, 
  interesting point . 
  the age of death may rise but what about the difference in quality of life in those later years , are they comparable ? 
  i 'm not even counting on ever receiving mine . 
  wonder how many turns it will take to build with their current resources . 
   i say , just let them go , really . 
  if the brits want to leave , let them . 
  if they eventually learn that it was n't such a great idea they can hold the politicians responsible who played with that contant threat of leaving . 
  you seem to be forgetting that the uk is a net contributor to the eu . 
  greater will be the union 's loss , not the other way around . 
   barbara steffens , ** equality minister ** in north rhine-westphalia til that such a thing exists in germany . 
  thanks for the insight !, 
   so they 're going to make smoking cigarettes illegal ? 
  which means that the tobacco market will become an underground one , and with that all the unpleasantness that crime brings with it . 
  why do people keep repeating the mistake of prohibition over and over again ? 
   but to me it seems a long way still until refugees actually make up a majority of the population . 
  in london ethnic brits are already a minority since at least 2012 ( date on the article ) : http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4bd95562-4379-11e2-a48c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3wem2dblh i do n't imagine this will happen * everywhere * , but it 's not valid to claim that it wo n't happen at all , or that it 's far away in the distant future , since it has already happened . 
  edit : the automoderator sent me a message saying that ft articles are paywalled , however the one i posted above is n't . 
  in any case , the relevant snippet from the article :  the surge of immigration has been especially striking in london , where more than one in three people -- 37 per cent -- were born outside the uk . 
   only 45 per cent of london 's population were white people of english , scottish or welsh heritage , according to the latest data , down from almost 60 per cent in 2001 . 
   this makes london the first uk region where white ethnic britons have become a minority . 
   snitches get stitches . 
  perhaps if you live in cova da moura or other similar neighbourhoods , otherwise not really . 
  jonas salk is spinning in his grave right now :(, 
  a very large portion of those are yet to be determined as refugees , and those that are n't will be doing what until then ? 
  and will they go peacefully back to their countries if asylum is rejected ? 
  the cost is n't paid only in money . 
  you ca n't buy guaranteed successful integration , and the larger the number of migrants the less likely they will assimilate . 
  they 're pretty popular here . 
   our representatives say we should use jesus to prevent teen pregnancies . 
  i thought conservative christians were against homosexuality . 
  you seem to think that the shit-hole that syria has turned into is completely divorced from the invasion of iraq ? 
  ignorant . 
  and if you 're still claiming `` vague bullshit '' you did n't even watch the video where cheney himself accurately describes what would happen to the region if sadam were deposed , almost 10 years before the invasion . 
  anyway , i 've had a look at the subreddits you moderate and your comments its obvious you 're either a troll or a pitty-seeker who thinks america is the poor blameless victim in this whole mess . 
  the war you started has larger ramifications than only iraq . 
  again , the bush administration knew this well before the invasion . 
  i assume he was asking the question since they 're being called refugees after they passed through multiple safe countries before reaching sweden . 
   starman is pole who went to space . 
  everyone knows polan ca n't into space, 
  thanks !, 
  obviously you 're exagerating , but the bush administration knew they 'd turn the region into a fire-pit and what the consequences would be . 
  before you start with the claims that you had no idea this would happen , your country * did know * exactly what would happen as you can see in this 1994 interview with cheney : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9yud9kyk9i pretty much describes what the region has devolved into . 
  your country is n't directly responsible for all the death and destruction in iraq and syria , but you are n't blameless either . 
  now that i come to think about this , we do n't have all that many jokes about spain ... at least not that i can remember . 
  though i do relish teasing folk from border cities like elvas by calling them spaniards  the joke i do know is : ------- a spanish guy , a portuguese guy , an old lady and a hot blonde are traveling in the same train car and they 're seated next to each other . 
  the train enters a tunnel and suddenly a * slap * rings out , and when the train exits the tunnel the spaniard has a red palm mark on his cheek . 
  - the blonde girl thinks : `` hah , the spanish guy probably tried to grope me but grabbed the old lady in the dark instead , and got slapped . '', 
  - the old lady thinks : `` the spanish guy probably tried to grope the blonde and got slapped . '', 
  - the spaniard thinks : `` that damn portuguese guy groped the blonde and she thought it was me ! '', 
  - the portuguse thinks : `` ca n't wait for the next tunnel so i can slap the spaniard again ! '', 
   spain is there , thus portugal is there . 
  ** eye twitches ... starts foaming at the mouth **, 
  dunno about you guys , but since we 've only had freedom of expression since '74 these topics are a non-issue in my country , at least from what i can tell . 
  perhaps its because we 've had this freedom for less time than lots of other countries , who knows ? 
  lots of people who lived under the old regime are still alive now and remind us how much worse it was . 
   we do have some cash but how would you think of being paid directly in pork and beer ? 
  might save us both some taxes , eh  excellent !, 
  this sounds like the kind of thing to discuss over a long meal of pork and beer !, 
  if you want a mountain so bad we can sell you one . 
  how about the peak of the [ ossa mountain range ] ( http://www.visitalentejo.pt/pt/o-alentejo/viva/serra-d-ossa/ ) in our flattest province ? 
  wow , 650 meters !, 
  such height !, 
  very mountain !,

  he protected from competition a small group of companies because he tought that economically was the best thing to do . 
  yes , if only we had a government each week we would be much better . 
  many smart decisions would be made and we would be swimming in money right now . 
  that is the only possibility . 
  of course they were . 
  although comparing both to caetano is very unfair . 
  i 'm not saying that we werent poor . 
  we were poor with salazar but we were poorer before him . 
  our economy was a disaster in the 1920 's . 
  he came along and things started to improve . 
  the attacks on portuguese settlers were caused by the cold war . 
  besides , granting independence to whom ? 
  our hasty retreat of africa was the cause for the civil wars in mozambique and angola . 
  of course i can do that argument , given the causes of our involvement in the first world war . 
  salazar had pressure from both the nazis and the allies to help each side , but he was able to stay neutral and we 've profited from it . 
  i 'm just saying that it is perfectly possible to dislike ones political views but respect their intellect . 
  m.caetano is one of greatest law thinkers we 've ever had and he is still studied today . 
  of course . 
  i 'm not saying that he was excellent because he was n't , but he also did many things right . 
  plus , he did so without getting rich or helping relatives getting rich . 
  he had morals - perhaps thats why people like him so much . 
  perhaps if we had had a democratic regime in the 40 's we would have been drawn to the second world war and we would have been destroyed . 
  the man got our economy growing sometimes at over 10 % a year . 
  granted , that wasnt enough to be one of the highest economies of the world , but its still pretty good . 
  i 'm not old enough to remember us growing more than 3 % . 
  second , it was n't all of the natives - most of the army we had was composed of native soldiers . 
  a country as small as ours could n't fight in 3 places at once without the `` help '' of natives . 
  more : the war began when some of the natives , sponsored by the cubans and the soviets started attacking the portuguese there . 
  what would you do if you were the portuguese government ? 
  would you have the `` whites '' thrown into the sharks ? 
  third , most of the soldiers could n't give a toss about `` freedom '' . 
  it was a carreer thing . 
  many fascists became democrats after the revolution . 
  we 've had many pm 's before he did and they could n't fix our problems . 
  he came along and he fixed many of the issues he had - we may not have become the richest country in the world , but with him we 've got better . 
  yes , but a better ruler than any of his predecessors . 
  but you can recognize one 's value even with opposing views . 
  the `` president '' - not the right word - of a.cunhal 's thesis was marcello caetano who was one of the notorious figures of the regime . 
  he graded his thesis paper very highly . 
  a. cunhal was escorted to the faculty by members of the secret police and didnt hid his views . 
  even still , caetano recognized his value . 
  yes , pre-28 our country was so much better . 
  our economy was booming and we were the most liberal country of europe . 
  then he came along and we came poor . 
  regarding africa , there was nothing else he could do . 
  we had 1.000.000 people there . 
  after the carnation revolution , they came back empty-handed - those who came back because many werent so lucky . 
  thats why we had 13 years of war . 
  most people understood that there was no choice but to fight . 
  even the carnation revolution was more about soldiers being discriminated in their carreers than it was about freedom . 
  well , perhaps this is just my pov , but many people i know have a positive view of him . 
  this is noticeable with the old for obvious reasons , but also amongst the young . 
  a few years ago , our national tv made a contest ( with the people voting ) about who was the greatest portuguese ever and he won . 
  also was very good at his job . 
  not many muslims are born in the czech republic . 
  i 've heard many people on tv saying that we `` should get used to '' this kind of things and `` learn to live with them '' . 
  hell no . 
  we know what the problem is . 
  it might be hard to fix , but we know what the problem is . 
  multiculturalism has failed . 
  but besides that , nothing american !, 
  that will show them !, 
  we still include that town in our maps . 
  we call it portuguese terroritory , administered by spain . 
  are you insane ? 
  we must not jeopardize cod . 
  i need it to live , man . 
  drinks are on us !, 
  time to party !, 
  so , is this article trying to imply that only left wing people can be journalists ? 
  i 'm portuguese . 
  was never asked for id in a bar or club . 
  even in casinos , i was able to enter when i was a minor . 
  nobody asks for id in clubs or bars , unless you look like a child . 
  you can have it back now , we already spent all the gold . 
  hehe , there 's a very famous portuguese song that goes something like this `` come , that love is n't the time we spent , and time does not make love , come , that love is the moment i give myself to you and you give yourself to me '' . 
  ( this is a very broad translation , dont hurt me portuguese bros. ), 
  first off , i bet you have a very cool name . 
  second , we 'll give you back extremadura and you give us back galicia and oliven\u00c7a . 
  deal ? 
  to be frank you always had bigger armies than us , but that did n't stop us from giving you a whooping from time to time . 
  nope , neither of us does anything around the house . 
  neither me or my brother contribute to the household budget - i 'm still a student , but my brother works and has a decent income . 
  it is not `` expected '' for us to contribute in any shape or faction . 
  my brother is incentivized to save a little money , but most importantly to travel and buy/do stuff he wo n't be able to do when he has a family of his own . 
  i would n't dare to leave my parent 's house , even if i was financially capable . 
  my brother who is 27 has a nice income and still lives with us - if its not to get married/living together with someone , why leave ? 
  terrible idea . 
  sultan erdogan might not be a democratic rolemodel but turkey has a vital purpose serving as a buffer zone between us and the middle east . 
  what would you say is the reason for that ? 
  we 'll have to agree to disagree . . , 
  all those you mentioned in your first line , werent a ministery the previous government ( at least , independently ) ; defense is a constant because its one of those fundamental roles of the state - that was my point all along . 
  and for a fundamental role we need a competent minister , one that knows his stuff . 
  why is it good that we have one ministery of defence , if they are n't important in your opinion ? 
  every government we had so far agreed that defense was so important that it deserved a ministery . 
  and they are not wrong . 
  every government we had so far agreed that defense was so important that it deserved a ministery . 
  why is defense always a ministery and other stuff is n't ( culture , for example ), 
  so , we should crap the ministery ( or several in your opinion ) completely and save a few bucks - it 's far cheaper to have a secretary of state that a ministery . 
  surprisingly , no government ever done that .

  if it is true , wtf !?!, 
   it must be perception , from where i 'm standing , it seems you 're eager gamble with yet even more money to get out of this when i 'm the one saying we already lost enough and should n't risk losing what we still have left . 
  not really , we should n't be the ones doing this . 
  europe and particularly the countries that do n't need structural reforms are the ones who should be doing expansionary economic policies . 
  we 'd just rise with the tide . 
  the malinvestments is a straw man argument , you did not see me making the argument for stupid public spending like our football stadiums or defending what we did that got us into this situation . 
  you did not address the [ multiplier effect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fiscal_multiplier ) . 
  which by the way also works in reverse , when you do austerity . 
  you did not explain how do you propose to go back to growth without destroying everything in the process . 
  you did not explain how those great companies you 're talking about will survive everyone deleveraging at the same time when there will be no demand for several years and when the banks that could finance their projects are zombies , unless the deleveraging is helped by some form of inflation ( i.e. 
  money printing ) . 
  austerity sadly does n't work to lower our interest rates either , austerity combined with the aforementioned multiplier effect has shown to lower your gdp a lot faster than it solves the deficit problem . 
  so i do n't really see how that helps our debt to gdp ration and our interest rates . 
  belgium was in a comparable economic situation to us , they did no austerity since they had no government and they seem to be doing a lot better . 
  finally , there are as a matter of fact several public investments that could be made with good roi like decent rail connected to our ports , some of the dams , etc. 
  frankly i think i 'm doing reality and thinking of how to solve the current problem while you seem to be doing morals and giving a lesson to your 6 yr old on money management . 
  what economic growth is severely hampered by is non-existent demand , something you can easily get when you are deflating and the private sector is deleveraging . 
  in those situations it 's necessary to kickstart the economy . 
  i do n't really see where do you think the economic growth will come from . 
  if everyone in europe , private and public , is deleveraging at the same time . 
  when everyone in the world wants to be an export oriented economy and there 's no one to export to . 
  maybe you do n't mind that everything that was achieved in the last 20 years goes bankrupt because there 's no demand for 10 years while everyone deleverages , but i do . 
  furthermore , there is also a multiplier effect so public spending can in many situations be a very important factor for economic growth . 
  we should n't be doing austerity in europe , it does n't work , it had its chance . 
  we do need to keep doing structural reforms but you do n't need to do austerity to do that . 
  france needs to do some austerity 1 % growth is way too much . 
  the deficit and interest rate point is just to underline the fact that our budgets are not as unbalanced as they seem . 
  our deficits are mainly caused by the huge interest rates we 're paying right now . 
  i 'm not blaming anyone else but our politicians and our voters for our situation . 
  however , saying that germany in particular or europe in general is handling this well is quite ridiculous in my opinion . 
   just look at our deficits and at theirs our deficits would be a lot smaller if we were paying their interest rates . 
  one could think that the policies that caused this capital fight from the periphery , due in great part to people seeing their result on greece , are a huge part of the problem we 're in and a huge part of the problem spain banks are in . 
   germany is far from being perfect but at least they 're thinking on the long term long term my ass . 
  they 're thinking a few months ahead when they will have federal elections again . 
  also , in the long term we are all dead . 
  i do agree with you on one thing . 
  this article sucks ass . 
  it 's like the author wants to irritate all the stakeholders in this problem . 
  this is what 's wrong with europe , we do a summit , people reach a compromise , a few days later each country is doing it 's own thing again like it never happened . 
  for fucks sake . 
  * rising -  raising, 
  apparently you like talking out of your ass . 
  do you even know what were the structural reforms for portugal ? 
  we have been doing most of them and quite quickly . 
  here , have some official reports [ january ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/countryfacts/prt/2012/012112.pdf )  let me conclude by congratulating the authorities for the strong start to the program and note that we share their view that clearly this is just a start and many challenges remain . 
  we welcome the authorities ' plans , for example through these workshops , to further strengthen the structural reform agenda in focus and specificity . 
  thank you very much . 
  [ statement by the ec , ecb , and imf on the fourth review mission to portugal ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/articles/financial_operations/2012-06-04-portugal_en.htm ) ( june )  the programme remains on track amidst continued challenges . 
  the authorities are implementing the reform policies broadly as planned and external adjustment is proceeding faster than expected . 
  in the future please refrain from commenting on things you know nothing about . 
  you . 
  you 're still right , pegged is still not the same as the same currency , since it is a lot easier to unpeg than to change your currency , and they only pegged quite recently ( early 2009 ? ) . 
  these effects take time . 
  another important factor is that they are right next to germany and other countries which still have a decent economy , while the troubled countries are next to other troubled or not so good countries , this is important because your main trading partners in europe tend to be next to you . 
  that may be , however , i think quazz has a point given the historic evidence we have from american evangelists fucking shit up in uganda . 
  it 's also great for our social security systems because we wo n't have to pay these people 's retirement . 
  fewer unemployment benefits to pay , fewer retirements to pay , win win . 
   in addition , emergency aid funds will in the future be made available to stabilize the bond markets without requiring countries , providing they are complying with eu budget rules , to adopt additional austerity measures . 
  this seems a lot like eurobonds to me . 
  while the new bank recapitalization mechanism seems a lot like printing . 
  anyway , i think this is a good mid term solution , europe needs to integrate a lot more but , realistically , that will take at least a few years . 
  europe can afford to play stupid morals with small economies like portugal , but it would be crazy and too expensive to do the same with italy and spain . 
  i think merkel actually did a good job this time , she previously got some controls in place and now is starting to show some flexibility like she should . 
  it sounds good because it is a good one . 
  people in charge , that made wrong decisions , refuse to change their minds and insist that they just have n't done the wrong thing for long enough . 
  it is exactly the same . 
  dude , the comparison with vietnam was to how the generals and politicians that made the wrong decisions stubbornly stayed the course instead of doing the right thing . 
  something that is very much like what 's happening in europe right now . 
  the germans are crazy if they think europe can solve this crisis by simply deflating in the periphery . 
  this path will just lead to more banks to continuously go under and the contagion to keep spreading . 
   but mrs merkel continues to insist that before anything is done to increase the burden on german taxpayers , building blocks towards greater fiscal , banking and , eventually , political union must be put in place . 
  i do agree with this but we need something to keep europe afloat in the mean time , i suggest printing . 
  printing would stop the deflation in the periphery and increase inflation in the core solving the competitiveness problem way quicker , with less pain and less bank problems . 
  you 're doing the same stupid mistake many other europeans make , and which seemingly offend you and your dignity . 
  which is to make stupid moral judgements on a whole group of people living on the same region based on prejudice and morals that do n't even really apply . 
   we are noble and dignified people , qualities which it appears the germans lack and will not be taught . 
  seriously , if most people can not see how this mirrors the idiotic way some northern people are demonizing us ... europe is beyond lost . 
  yes , the europeans in other less troubled regions should change their posture , but , while you and them , keep thinking in terms of we and them , nothing is going to change . 
  that diversity between north and south is precisely because the moors were in the south for much longer , in over 1k years we did n't lose that diversity so i 'm not that worried . 
  your example is not very good , portuguese are in general a little darker and less blonde than the other europeans because the iberian peninsula was occupied by moors for quite a long time and that happened well before portuguese people went to japan . 
  that was before portugal , one of the oldest nations in the world , even existed . 
  i 'm carrying a recessive blue eyes gene , i 'm pretty sure that will make it impossible for me to reproduce . 
  if only it was dominant i 'm sure girls would flock to my beautiful blue eyes . 
  i 'd love to agree with you , but words like these cause prejudices and stereotypes that can take a generation to fade away . 
  words like these make things harder for portuguese nationals , companies and products whose quality becomes considered substandard when it 's actually fucking great . 
  the same way the good german engineering stereotype benefits german products the stereotype created by the usage of this acronym and bad reporting is not good at all for us . 
  i do n't see why , what he seems to be defending are strong european institutions being the guard dogs ( he actually defended an `` european finance minister '' ) and i think almost everyone can agree with that . 
  what we have now is what i consider germany taking over our government and it 's an uncomfortable position for everyone involved . 
  i do n't think people realize how dangerous these insults are , not everyone ( if any ) in those acronyms is so lighthearted as most portuguese , and the reaction you get is stuff like golden dawn , so thank you . 
  i agree that greece needed to reform , but if the objective was that they would also become a fiscally sustainable country maybe things could have been done in such a way that their gdp did n't got completely destroyed in the process . 
  i mean they have already defaulted once , and the way this is going they will default again because their gdp keeps falling , and this is just a death and deflationary spiral . 
  soon there wo n't be anything to reform . 
   gdp is set to shrink this year by up to 7 % holy shit ... as a comparison we 're implementing pretty hard austerity measures too and ours is set to shrink only [ 3.2 % this year and 0.9 % ] ( http://www.oecd.org/document/41/0,3746,en_33873108_33873764_45270249_1_1_1_1,00.html ) next year , and the prevision is that growth will be back afterwards which gives some hope i guess . 
  of course these are all just forecasts so take it with a grain of salt but i do n't see how there can be any hope left in greece , i 'd be leaving the country for sure . 
  you have a point , but my opinion is not based solely on this article . 
  in fact it 's not based in any article at all although i 've read plenty which show that the lazy southerner narrative is not as circumscribed as you seem to think it is . 
  my opinion , however , comes mainly from the fact that it 's so politically hard for merkel to let europe do anything that might actually solve the eurozone problems which for me is evidence that there are a lot of german voters this misguided . 
  first time i upvoted you , hopefully not the last . 
  more like `` eurozone crisis leaves german ignorant , misguided welder feeling bullied and misunderstood '' . 
  if your books and newspapers tell you this was caused by 55 years of age retirements and mediterranean laziness and you lack the knowledge and critical thinking to realize this is completely false , you 're an idiot .

  with brand name stuff and you pass within 1 meter of them and they smell sickening . 
  not fun in elevators . 
  thank you america . 
  they could all learn the concept of private conversation voice tone though . 
   certain places should be enjoyed by as many people as possible , just like works of art . 
  if you put people crushed like sardines in some squares or museums nobody enjoys the works of art ( been to museums where you literally could not reach a main attraction ) or the experience . 
  see , a northern-southerner divider . 
  nightly ( 6 times a night , 3 times for generic non recyclables , 2 times for packaging recyclabes , once a week for paper , and glass you take to the street picking points ) is the norm in lisbon . 
  i have been completely shocked friends in northern europe got garbage pick up every 2 weeks , bio residues just sitting there 2 weeks , it \u00b4 s not a good mental image . 
  but for the neighbourhood , while tourists innocently not being aware of it , or having * needs * which are different , innocence can have the same result as malice . 
  say you are a tourist and you want to ask a local the way for the nearest open supermarket or pharmacy or which public transportation to this destination . 
  you are only asking once a year !, 
  it \u00b4 s really rare you need that information , but if you live in a place with lots of tourists and you pass through 1000 a day , you are going to get some of those interactions in a month and sometimes it \u00b4 s with really unfortunate timing . 
  furthermore , tourists do not want other tourists . 
  they want to go to non touristy restaurants , they do not want other tourists in their landscape photos , they want to interact with locals and not other tourists . 
  you know they will get very very drunk and whatever happens when they are drunk does not count you decadent westerner . 
  if they think they got it bad , they don \u00b4 t , they so far got it as bad as other eu citizens . 
  try being a non eu citizens , hoteliers are clamoring over it . 
  august is becoming more and more infernal for anything . 
  the more people travel , the more inadequate the infrastructure proves itself to be , either that is passport control , access to tourist attractions or restaurant service in tourist attractions . 
  if you possibly can do not travel in august . 
  my sorry excuse for gaydar is pinging like mad ... 
   how are tourists causing gentrification ? 
  honest question . 
  are the talking about rich brits or germans buying houses there ? 
  on some places yes . 
  the gra\u00e7a or chiado neighbourhood of lisbon are now filled with rich french or brazillian people . 
  but in general on some neighbourhoods , nobody is renting anymore to full time residents , they are evicting as soon as possible and putting the apartments on airbnb . 
  houses for sale are bought by somebody who buys them , remodels them airbnb style ( very clean lines , very focused on looking good for photos but neglecting stuff like clothes washing machines ) and puts them on airbnb . 
  it totally changes a neighbourhood . 
  you lose full time residents , people who might patronize grocery stores and hardware stores and bookshops . 
  you get a lot of `` indian '' convenience stores with really high prices and open till the night . 
  tourists make noise ( they are on holiday , and even if they are nice responsible people maybe they need to take their noisy wheely bags at 5 am to catch their flight back home ) . 
  they are completely baffled by trash collecting schedules and rules . 
   i really wonder how it will look like in lets say next 50 years , when billions of africans or asians starts to be more wealthy , don \u00b4 t assume wealth progress is going to be ininterrupted for the next 50 years for the third world . 
  the world in 50 years will be a lot different , there are not enough resources to assume billions more will be able to have a nice western style with showers and air conditioning and air travel . 
  and pressure from third world foreigners buying real estate for residence visas or investment is already a huge problem in canada and australia . 
  some european countries already have such schemes and it \u00b4 s affecting badly the real estate of some cities like lisbon . 
  for full disclosure , it does not get to -10 in lisbon ever . 
  how record is maybe -1 something . 
  but +3 with total humidity and strong winds can be really unpleasant . 
  and it does not rain as fast and hard unexpectedly ifyou are even just 50 or 100 km away from the ocean ... 
   i never eat anything raw so that 's not a problem . 
  yeah , but i do , like mayonaise or chocolate mousse and often have eggs which are not cooked all the way ( those are the best ) , so i would rather not risk eggs from chickens which might be suffering from diarrhea or an infection . 
  if i am buying eggs don \u00b4 t need to want to worry , oh this might be unsafe , i need to check them all before i decide which is going to be one i choose to be just partially cooked . 
  if sellers could wash eggs besides them being able to push that egg at you , the wash potentially destroys the egg protecting film and any pathogens on the shit or blood could get inside the egg and reproduce like crazy before the egg finally gets eaten . 
  feathers or straw not an issue . 
  blood or shit might be a symptom the chicken is ill , in which case better not eat that egg particularly raw . 
  we have had hot spells either , but yeah at least near the ocean the temperatures tend to dip during the night . 
  and wind !, 
  a lot of foreigners get caught really unprepared for how cool and windy portuguese summer nights can be . 
  and as an extra we can have extremely fierce downpours , and damp windy cold winter days ...

  finns are not finnish white after 6 months in portugal , even if it was winter , not most of them . 
  everybody gets a bit of a tan , even if they go through some sunburns first , day in and day out . 
  atlantic ocean ftw . 
  we are fine , we had lots of 16 to 28 days which for me is absolutely ideal summer weather . 
  heating up a bit . 
  that is nothing wrong with that , but if the egg came with blood or shit , you would notice and complain and not use that egg . 
  but if the eggs could be washed , even eggs with blood or chicken shit would pass , and you would be more likely to eat those eggs . 
  that is the point . 
  i wonder if the chlorinated chicken is not a bit of the same thing , but so much the process but that the process can be used to mask less safe food . 
  supposedly their ancestors come from india or pakistan . 
  but here it \u00b4 s pretty mixed . 
  on average ciganos ( they are not rom people and would not like to be called that ) are darker than the average but hey we had a multicontinental empire for centuries , lots of people can have ancestors from asia or africa and be a little bit darker anyway . 
  this is a portuguese secretary of state ( like a junior minister ) who is cigano ( and a former mayor ) hhttp : / / www.portugal.gov.pt/pt/ministerios/madj/equipa/secretario-estado/carlos-miguel.aspx he looks totally generic and that is just an example . 
   in usa , if you , after the age of 15 , decide you want a higher education , you can always pay for it , take a loan , whatever . 
  don \u00b4 t wish that for your own country . 
  they can do loans , attend anything because universities there are businesses ( if not exactly for profit ) , and the way they survive is requiring a lot of money from those who attend . 
  so of course they want everybody to be able to attend . 
  and there are a lot of people in debt for educations which are practically worthless , while for the finantially responsible poor even if they can get the loan carrying the debt might be scary them . 
   ca n't do anything besides regoing elementary school . 
  can \u00b4 t they get a special chance to skip redoing school by just taking an exam about the courses they skipped ? 
  i see your problem though , just think the american model is far from being a good solution . 
   attendance is only one way to look at it , though . 
  but more attendance might mean nothing if the school is pretty bad . 
  i read about evangelical colleges , diploma mills . 
  in portugal you got the public ( older , cheaper , more difficult to get into , heavily subsidized even for things like their campus and research projects ) and private universities . 
  if you cut the number of graduates from private universities we would have less college graduates but very few of those private university graduates do learn something useful , became more useful to society because they attended those private universities . 
  it \u00b4 s often a vanity thing . 
   free higher education is reserved for a minority of the population , who made that decision when they still were children . 
  if university education is free it seems likely they will try to limit the number of vacancies to more or less what they think society needs . 
  not going to university does not mean a 15 year old can \u00b4 t be as necessary to society as somebody who goes . 
  but i am sorry you are totally blocked from applying . 
  in portugal you also select your `` area '' when you are 15 , and some for example do not teach the kind of maths you need for some universities , but up to a certain age ( 22 or 25 ) anybody can study on their own the program and apply to the national exams according to the requirements of each course . 
  past that age , they can also apply but it gets even simpler , i think . 
  you are assuming a lot of the population having a university education is the desirable thing . 
  maybe . 
  but if the university education is free or heavily subsided , maybe for society in general it \u00b4 s better to apply some filter , to limit how many vacancies there are to make sure the ones getting a university education are the ones who can actually make the most of it . 
  free university services will always , because public funded , put some quotas , some blocks to how many vacancies are created and on which fields . 
  we do not need all 18 year olds to go to university we need some to pick up truck driving schools , or learn welding or haircutting . 
  a lot of 18 year olds see university as the only way for professional respect and a nice wage , and i actually think a lot don \u00b4 t realize how much better paid some non university skills are ( welders , truck drivers , plumbers can earn a lot more than people with degrees in marketing or even law ), 
  is that unusual in your country ? 
  a lot of gypsies can be as white skinned as the rest of the population and blonde ( particularly in children ) and pale eyes are not totally rare . 
  it \u00b4 s an interesting point , but to be really fair , maybe it \u00b4 s better to compare just 25-35 year olds or something . 
  if you are comparing for such a wild range of ages , a lot of european 64 year olds grew up in countries were access to education was very different than what it is now , and i guess very different that what it was in canada . 
  in portugal we had many less universities , say 10 % or 5 % of current student vacancies .

  the exit polls usually get it right . 
  this is n't an exit poll . 
  still fairly leaning towards a nai win . 
  the betting markets usually get it right and they were leaning for nai . 
  tsipras ai n't budging no more if he wins this buddy . 
  if that is a good or a bad thing well ... 
  i did n't call the netherlands a tax heaven , though i should have made it more clear : their personal fortunes ( that they do n't disclose ) are on tax heavens . 
  their companies that they obviously ca n't hide are registered to pay taxes on luxenbourg and the netherlands . 
  one of our biggest retailers pays many taxes to them instead of us : he also is know for treating his employees very badly . 
  it makes me really bitterly angry when i hear the stories of people working late hours well into christmas or easter day and even worker 's day and not get paid for it : if they refuse they are fired . 
  i must confess i am not sure about anything anymore . 
  i know first hand how harsh austerity is ( and i was not one of the unluckiest , unfortunately austerity targets those who are worst in life much worse ) but they are staring at the abyss and taking a step ahead if the vote no . 
  if the vote comes as yes and the eu still fucks them over i will lose so much hope for its future . 
  this must be so heartbreaking for greece 's youth ... 
  within margin of confidence , still thinking nai will win the day . 
  yeah its all the evil lazy workers fault . 
  they do n't want to work , despite the fact that people are literally working for free and even paying to work just to add the experience to their curriculum . 
  this is of course very good , after all they are learning new skills !, 
  they should be so grateful to their employer for letting them work for free or just a small bit of money so that they can learn all these valuable skills !, 
  anything else is le ebil socialist conspiracy too turn us away from the path set forth by the glorious invisible hand . 
  there has to be a meet me in the middle solution to this . 
  workers ca n't be seen as merely tools to be used and disposed of as they go unfit for service , and companies ca n't merely be a machine for generating profit . 
  at the other side there has to be enough incentive for people to update their skills and seek to better themselves , but this has to take in account that this is not something everyone is capable of , either due to advanced age , limited intellectual ability or other misfortunes of life . 
  if the collapse of the soviet union showed us that collectivism alone is n't enough to make a stable and happy society , this last few years ought to teach us the opposing lesson : the `` let the big fish eat the little ones '' mentality when taken to the extreme can be just as harmful . 
  you seem rather exalted dude . 
  just let democracy take its course , it seems you will have your way in the end anyway . 
  i do hope someone manages to extort a bit of dignity out of the current eu institutions though . 
  small businesses pay their taxes more ( but there are versions of the software that you can bribe the companies to install that have `` backdoors '' allowing you to circumvent it and still seem legit to the customer ) and that is of course very positive . 
  the problem is that the really big fish still do n't pay their taxes . 
  their fortunes are stowed away in `` fiscal heavens '' and their companies are registered in countries like holland and luxenbourg and they pay their reduced taxes ... but use our infrastructure , their workers are educated on our public schools and receive our public care , they use our roads , if they get fired they receive our subsidies , etc. . . 
  yeah , i too wonder why some people insist on calling the act of letting people decide on their own future democracy !, 
  truly the saddest and most undemocratic of ways :(, 
  it 's the same in portugal man . 
  shame our governments seem to be cheering on this madness rather than showing solidarity for those who are willing to fight against these policies . 
  and then they have the gall to say `` it 's working '' . 
  and then they wonder why young people vote against austerity ... that is criminal behaviour . 
  did your employers also get a sudden need to constantly have `` lots of fresh blood '' by rotating through interns while never hiring any of them ? 
  we pumped money into their country 's debt , not its economy for the most part . 
  we took over private debt so that the banks and investors who gave them the loans would n't crash and burn . 
  yeah , its been a great time for employers for sure , since they cut so hard on worker 's rights and benefits you get to enjoy cheaper labour ( also the intern thingie where the state pays for a good chunk of the salary ) , much less job security , much lesser pay because people are desperate . 
  for the people though the austerity measures will take many decades before the austerity measures that were implemented can be fully taken off . 
  if you are ambitious and can leave there 's really not much of a reason not too . 
  maybe you should get out of your circle more and see the misery that abounds ? 
  if that growth is anything like portugal 's , trust me , nobody was noticing but the rich guys . 
  it 's convenient to pretend after causing the disaster in a country due to its political choices that everything would have been fine if they had just voted for the guys you liked and that were so subservient to you . 
  of course you had to sneak a generalization to all the greek people in there , because this is / r/europe and everybody knows the greeks were asking for it . 
   to build stuff and satisfy ~ ~ my people ~ ~ the oligarchs, 
  the law , in its majestic equality , forbids both gay and heterosexual people from marrying someone their own gender . 
  no , i 'm sure that if they start a war they will get their debt forgiven , seems fairly standard for europe . 
  if a government is deciding against the will of the people ( calling them `` masses '' is one of the worst dismissals of democracy i 've ever heard ) then it is the government that is being manipulated . 
   ireland as been less noisy than portugal when did we make any noise at all ? 
  look at it this way : most likely there wo n't be a landslide victory for the yes or for the no : both will represent about half of the population ( they may not , i 'm going off of polls , which can frequently be wrong ) . 
  in this case if new elections are called you may have a problem : syriza wins again , gets the 50 seat bonus and effectively blocks the formation of any new government because it is far better at gathering the anti austerity vote than pasok , nd , potami are at gathering the pro austerity vote . 
  and old people do n't understand the dangers of supporting centrists . 
  come on , i 'm sure you can do much better than golden mean fallacies . 
  i think you really need to not believe in every shitty stereotype people parrot around . 
  it 's one thing to interfere , it 's another very different thing to call for governments to resign . 
  i do n't understand why you bundle portugal with italy . 
  the culture is not similar at all from my experience . 
  maybe the stereotypes about southern countries are similar ? 
  also the italian economy is leagues above portugal 's . 
  the guardian was reporting a few polls that had a victory for oxi but with increasingly diminishing margins but i ca n't really attest to their credibility as i know very little about greek polling companies . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_bailout_referendum,_2015 ) lists two polls made after the referendum announcement with links to their sources . 
  i do n't see how someone in his position would confuse a statement available to the public with one directed to the government . 
  and even in that case it does n't sound right to tell to a government they should resign like that . 
  the poll saw a small increase in the yes vote but a large increase for the undecided right ? 
  people who go from no to undecided are more likely to vote yes , or not vote at all . 
  but well , there 's too much riding on it to trust polls , particularly from greek media . 
  i always perceived schulz as the `` moderate '' guy among all the involved ... :(, 
  wrong post maybe ? 
  also it proves very little as to the actual effectiveness of a measure because we do n't know how many she would be sending if the measure happened not to be in effect . 
  well , when all your media is in the hand of a small elite of oligarchs ... 
  someone posted the stats on \u039f\u03a7\u0399 / \u039d\u0391\u0399 coverage in the press and the `` yes '' campaign had something like 10 times more coverage in almost all newstations . 
  let them eat cake . 
  the first rule of capital controls is that you deny any plans for capital controls . 
  find my a government that announced capital controls in advance of implementing them . 
  do n't the polls suggest a ` yes ' victory ? 
  how the fuck is this somethign acceptable for a foreign authority representative to say about the government of another country ? 
  he may personally believe it , ** as do i ** but that decision is up to the government and the people of greece . 
  if any other country started suggesting the conditions under which the german government should resign there would be outrage from germany , and rightly so . 
  what he said is that it is not ok to be a muslim and de-radicalized because you still hold moral values incompatible with our `` liberal democratic '' society . 
  he then mentions that christianity suffers from the same problem . 
  when confronted with largely christian population of europe he then claims that this does n't matter because they do n't go to church , implying those who do are as dangerous as muslims , which he then compares to car banners and nazis . 
  overall this guy is deranged . 
  but those who do live in a religious fashion are not really comparable to the nazis , like londonghost tried to say . 
  no , i did n't as your post was clearly implying that germany 's defaults and debt pardons were somehow more justified than greece 's eventual default . 
  also is buzzword the new buzzword for historical fact ? 
  you ca n't compare them ... because the circumstances of a eventual grek default are far more benign than those of the german default . 
  after all i do n't remember greece waging genocidal war against half of europe . 
   however , i do n't think we should be so negative in the longer term as history remains an uncertain process , ready to present us with surprises now and then . 
  more value should be given to the short term . 
  we can not spend our days thinking on long term possibilities of actions that have short term disastrous consequences . 
  the idea that all will be well , eventually , is mostly fruitless because the very concept of what `` being well '' is changes quickly . 
  also i ca n't help but think that greeks are completely and utterly fucked either way . 
  the feeling of helplessness must be so awful . 
  by your logic you only care about drinking ouzo and taking naps on the beach side while evading taxes and eating goat cheese . 
  i am not arrogant enough to suppose to imagine how other people think . 
  i still do n't see why the left should change its ideology based on its current popularity . 
  what purpose does that serve ? 
  should the left strive to be in power at any cost first , and uphold its ideals second ?

  from classes 1 to 9 you are graded  90 % - excellent , 90-70 % - exceeds expectations ; 70-50 % - achieves expectations ; < 50 % - does n't achieve expectations . 
  from grade 10 to universitiy you are graded 1-20 , being 20 the highest mark and 9,5 the minimum to pass . 
  2 - depends on the year and how schools set up the schedule . 
  but 10th and 11th years require more time spent on school , since you have to study for university exams on 12th year . 
  3 - the curriculum is set by the ministry of education . 
  after 9th grade you choose a high school course which will give you some fundamentals more specialized on the area you pretend to follow after high school ( it 's either humanities , economics , arts , or science and technology if you ~ ~ pretend ~ ~ intend to study in university and there are a fuckton of technical courses if you just want to start working ) . 
  4 - yes . 
  there 's a national assigned curriculum for each year . 
  the order of subjects might change from teacher to teacher , but you still have to fulfill it by the end of the year . 
  5 - the only optional class is religion and moral . 
  you can choose what languages you learn through 7th to 11th grade ( english + spanish/french/german / latin ) and which 2 classes to learn besides the obligatory maths , portugese and pe ( biology and psicology are the most popular ) .

  it 's used to describe mixed black/white people and light skinned black people, 
  breakfast cereals , a toast or sandwhich with milk or yoghurt, 
  yes . 
  you can see it by the shit they pass on is catered to old people, 
  [ there are about 110 million russians in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_russia ) . 
  and there are also native speakers in neighboring countries , pushing this count a few millions up, 
   the language that has more native speakers in europe is german . 
  it 's russian actually, 
  but all of them are catholics or agnostics that try to pass as non practicing catholics , so it does n't matter . 
  how are those tests supposed to be reliable anyway ?

  there is no tradition of it here . 
  some people might complain about stuff getting corroded . 
  most likely, 
  why ? , do you like spanish mediterranean towns ? 
  putting salt on watermelon or eating it with a spoon - never seen , would frame you as a lunatic and a waster of perfectly good watermelon . 
  just cut a piece for you and share the rest with the others . 
  for regular melons , eating it with ham is nice . 
  if you are feeling a bit sophisticated , you can cut canteloupes in halves , remove the seeds , mix any fruits inside and eat it with a spoon .

  dont know were i got the 200 milion : s must have been some cross information derp on my brain but you are right , most of sources say its 50 , 60 or 60 +, 
  wars like ? 
  i dont remeber seeing francois hollande declaring war on anyone o_o, 
  that was an estimate of the victims caused by the war , which most of the people blame the nazi regime on . 
  i am not saying that this is true , i am just trying to indicate to what causes people to say that far-right is worst than far-left, 
  nazi germany , 60m + worldwide my point is , it easier to see the death and destruction that the far-right caused than the far-left . 
  editer : brain derp on the number of casualities, 
  they had a less bloody ending , and also they stand for the lowest class of people , which there are alot , so its easy for them to get votes , just say something ignorant like the state wants you poor so you can work harder !!, 
  but we dont ( we dont want you poor we want slaves muhahahaha ), 
  or because europe already knows what happens when you vote far-right ( nazi germany . . ), 
  reverse ww2 , italy germany portugal and spain , basically all the old facist ditatorships , agaisnt the nazi allies, 
  i was trolling :p , basically what i said was that we can only be equal in disgrace ... 
  its is possible for that utopia to become true , if the human race gets enslaved , so lets all hope for the robots that we create to enslave us so we can have an 100 % worker and comunist world and we all be alike , without freedom and starving !!!, 
  ( ok i 'm done with the trolling ) but sometimes i wish people would get what they ask for :(, 
  how can someone be worste than france ? 
  70 years ago they got invaded by far right racists , and now they are voting for them ... 
  i blame the education system of these european countries , people are getting more ignorant every day , its like the new documentary on discovery about the rise of nazi party to power says , `` if you dont learn from history , you are going to make the same mistake . '', 
  i saw the interview and i think it was proof of direct intervention by the russian army, 
  and they either drive a micra or a seat ibiza, 
   while in mcdonalds is always at least 6-7 $ ( burguer + chips + drink ) 5 $ medium menu, 
   and on top of that being forced to loan greece over 1 billion euros through the ecb most of that money was lent before we called troika , so its pretty much on our former pm for lending money while we couldnt even sustain ourselves . 
  if during the communist rule you would divide europe between communist and capitalist countries you also would divide it between poor and rich europe, 
   but as a german it 's my impression that most people with turkish immigration backgrounds are pretty well integrated around here funny enough most kebab restaurants that i saw here in portugal were founded by german turks . 
  pretty much, 
  also paper industry only cuts the trees that they grow . 
   cut aid to developing countries . 
  ( to be proposed . ), 
  that is retarded, 
   or is olivenza/oliven \u00e7a actually something special ? 
  its just an old border dispute that nobody today cares about . 
  basically pre-napolionic wars spain and france invaded portugal and in the peace deal they took oliven\u00e7a , part of french guyana and portugal took a bit chunk of what today is brasil from spain . 
  after the napolionic wars in the peace deals spain was supposed to give oliven\u00e7a back ... and we are still waiting . 
  that and cheap oil . 
  arent they in every active front ? 
   we could spend the resources we waste in bull fighting on improving the quality of life of bulls ( and other animals ) what happens to the resources when the income stops ? 
  the resources only exist because people pay a ticket to see them . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate yep , sweden is way more dangerous than lithuania !, 
   its lack of democracy care to explain ? 
   australia even also looking possible . 
  i tough it was proven when someone found naval artillery from the 16th century in a australian beach, 
  that is probably putin troll army, 
   the guys performing the experiment in portugal are roaming through lisbon 's downtown and a mall . 
  look at 2:25 , that isnt either a mall or downtown . 
  oops, 
   but can you explain how and what will make the difference ? 
  do you remember what the us army did to iraque 's army during the iraqui war ? 
  or they count the parents also . 
  well , spending 900 of those 1000years as a slave might have helped with that some would say . 
   actually they represent the 5 moorish kings we killed to form the kingdom i dont know if they all died , i think our king just defeated the 5 of them in a single battle . 
  see , thats why you failed , you need to drink to forget like us !, 
   i am still fucking scared of having children [ i wonder why ] ( http://imgur.com/rajlsnq ), 
  spain-portugal fucks up your teory, 
   caribe neerland\u00eas that is pt-br i think, 
  you kept the \u00e7 in cura\u00e7ao but not the \u00e3 ? 
  at least your language doesnt come in small letters under spanish, 
  in the end of the article : https://usatmarkets.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/capture30.jpg?w=1000 debt is debt , it doesnt matter what they do to it . 
  capitalism is run on debt , companies that are worth bilions , like apple and mcdonals also have a bilions in debt . 
  do you think whenever mcdonals wants to open a new restaurant the owner just saves money to do it ? 
  he ask for a loan and hopes that the investment will be enough to pay off the loan and interest and still have a profit . 
  same goes for countries , when a country wants to build a new airport or highway they dont save money in the bank , they ask for money because they know that that might help the economy grow and bring enough benefits that will pay off the interest . 
  i am not saying that you should go full portugal or greece and overspend , but under spending is also a problem because the country is missing an opportunity to grow faster . 
  i mean the totals , for example germany has 70 % public debt in relation of gdp , switzerland 52 % but estonia only has 6 %, 
  is it 100 % positive ? 
  acquiring debt is normal for any western government and having a low debt may mean that the government is missing chances to develop the country . 
  those weapons were used against portuguese soldiers that were manly conscripted against their will . 
  the portuguese communist party was a big supporter of the ussr , helping them supply the colonies with weapons in the colonial war . 
  they also support a lot of communist leaders since their leaders met with the soviet ones and in the anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall they put a statement basically saying it was a sad thing and east germany was best germany !, 
  good thing he is burning all the bridges now , its not like he need the trust of markets to ask for money for decent interest and become independent from troika . 
   ` the communists ' are pretty loaded descriptions which i assume were not part of the original article . 
  the communist party is wildly accepted in several european countries that have no idea what the real russian communist party did , for example we have 2 communist parties that had 7,91 % and 1,12 % of the votes last elections . 
  its not `` student cheap '' , i can eat the the college cafeteria for 2,5 $ or in a restaurant for 3,5 $ but an adult meal is around 5 $ same as mcdonalds which is quite cheap, 
  they sell crappy food/beverages for low prices with shitty quality . 
  no its not , we can get rich thanks to euromillions !, 
   the imf refuses participation unless there is debt restructuring . 
  and they also refuse to be that of the restructuring . 
  they want a restructuring , if that doesnt affect their money, 
  we have to watch both !, 
   events with greece just make it worse . 
  i honestly belevie we are better with z\u0142oty . 
  greece had 120 % debt before joining the euro , so you can put the blame only on it, 
  its what been keeping the world powers from entering a war between each other for 70 years, 
  maybe those bases wouldnt exist if the countries didnt felt threatened ? 
  it does make sense , people that are left in poverty with no option often resort to begging or stealing, 
   here in the netherlands $ 1000 would probably not be enough to house , feed , clothe and insure one person in most places , especially if this wage would also need to pay for the base requirements of keeping a job ( transportation ) when people were talking about subsidies to refugees which are around 700 $ in denmark , which is the 6th most expensive place to live in the world and more expensive than the netherlands , it was ok !, 
   ( when convenient of course ) and while researching that , most articles said that basically this : `` sometimes it is wrongly said that the catholic church opposes stem cell research . 
  in fact , the church supports ethically responsible stem cell research , while opposing any research that exploits or destroys human embryos . 
  because the church opposes deliberately destroying innocent human life at any stage , for research or any other purpose , it opposes embryonic stem cell research as currently conducted . '', 
   this . 
  we ca n't repeat this harsh truth too often : this shortcoming of democracy in general needs to be solved some way or another . 
  people forget that the catholic church was also a big promoter of science ( when convenient of course ) , [ and still is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vatican_advanced_technology_telescope ), 
  you didnt point to another alternative , so austerity is still the only alternative ? 
  you dont live in portugal , thats for sure !, 
  its funny because here in portugal its regular for you to eat in a restaurant , go get a coffee at a cafe and go to a grocery store without paying taxes . 
  in fact i dont remember paying taxes for anything that is less than 5 $ and even the things that are more its very rare in those places . 
  is it regular for people from northern europe to buy like a coffee or something under 2 $ and get a receipt without asking for it ? 
  if they leave they have to do a 100 % default , and no country in europe would accept that, 
   whether you accept the existing terms on offer or not will make little difference . 
  funny enough , the vote today is noting more than a confidence bote on syriza . 
  because in both cases they will have to negotiate a new agreement because the last one prescribed , but if yes wins tsipras ( it was him righ ? ), 
  said he was going to resign .

  all of northern ireland could vote for independentist candidates for westminster and it would n't mean anything and it would amount to nothing . 
  it 's the same problem with the argument rajoy has against catalonia 's referendum when he says that it should be democratically voted in the congress of deputies where catalonia holds a tiny minority of seats . 
  i disagree , and since we are both speculating there is not much more to be said . 
  is it any better to vote to be ruled by an institution when your end goal is to break free from it ? 
  knowing that no matter how much in favour of your position your people vote , it is still a tiny minority of the way to getting it to freely relinquish its power over you ? 
  i disagree , i think it could potentially affect us in the not so long term . 
  no amount of border security can insulate us completely in the age of globalization . 
  as is thinking that what is happening right outside your borders will not affect you if you go isolationist hard enough . 
  75 % they have a majority . 
  the point is that if you vote for others they will go on to represent you in an institution whose legitimacy to rule you you do not recognize . 
  so as a protest against the yoke , you send no one . 
  there 's also the problem with mps being forced to swear loyalty to the queen . 
  results coming out point to better than normal tory performance . 
  to me its pretty clear there will be a tory majority , with perhaps slightly more seats than last time . 
  people are kinda ashamed to say they do n't like corbyn but no way in hell some of them would vote for him or for someone who did not keep him out . 
  yep , they never take their seats . 
  in portugal employees remarking to their bosses that it 's past the end of work time will often say `` est\u00e1 na horinha '' , which means `` it 's the hour '' but with hour in the diminutive . 
  i 'm sorry , i 'm not versed in the proper terminology . 
  no offence meant . 
  uk unionists from northern ireland ? 
  conservatives + irish unionists is obvious as their rethoric on labour is that corbyn is a terrorist sympathizer - it only remains to be seen if it is possible . 
  though my prediction at this point is a conservative outright absolute majority . 
  polls have been wrong before and the shy tory vote is strong . 
  that 's also not a solution . 
  it may partially fix the symptoms , but the problem will keep festering outside our ivory tower . 
  permanent arrangements for refugee support outside our borders and for pacification of the middle east must be made , and i think it should start by quickly bringing the countries not currently involved in civil wars up to a decent standard of development . 
  i know a few which are completely free for all uses and look much more professional . 
  there 's free templates they could have used to produce better results in an hour if that 's the route we are going . 
  would those accept this kind of coin ? 
  i can barely get them to accept perfectly normal coins sometimes , so i always thought they were very strict about shape and weight . 
  or he could just give it to someone as change . 
  what percentage of coins is eventually deposited in the bank ? 
  hunger , poverty , all great things . 
  nice deflection after you just literally praised thatcher on what she did to coal miners . 
  do you really say that without feeling the slightest bit disgusted about thanking someone for utterly destroying livelihoods without providing any source of compensation or even showing sympathy to her victims . 
  god this capitalist world never ceases to sicken me . 
  they ca n't use nuclear blackmail because we have nuclear weapons . 
  the obvious moral decision when someone sends a nuclear attack is not to retaliate though , because you only generate a larger problem by retaliating and do not fix anything . 
  would you prefer the world to end instead of the evil evil russians who 'd totally use nuclear weapons on us conquering europe ? 
  there 's a reason why we do n't elect internet tough guys for high office . 
  you are already dead at that point . 
  there is no way to kill the other guy , he 's probably hiding from nuclear strikes . 
  you just need to choose between a country getting destroyed or two countries getting destroyed . 
  i ca n't understand the cult of suffering behind the widespread admiration for people like thatcher and other austeritarians . 
  there is this easily thaught dogma that `` yes , everything became worse but it was necessary because we were having it too good '' . 
  people feel like their suffering is righteous , that it is correct morally that the majority should suffer . 
  is n't that why it is so vital to have someone with corbyn 's moral fiber on the trigger finger ? 
  vengeance is pretty meaningless when you in trying to carry it out not only will you probably miss the motherfuckers who did it , you also ended up roasting to cinder millions of people who are probably not happy with the decision to use the bomb . 
  i think it 's important in war to recognize that just because your people are doomed you should n't ruin humanity 's slim chance of survival . 
  particularly since you 'd be exacting vengeance upon people who likely had no say on the matter . 
  here 's the thing about using nuclear weapons : they are deterrance . 
  if nuclear weapons are deployed against you already there is no actual point in using them . 
  if they are n't deployed , there naturally is n't any excuse to use them . 
  so whatever the situation you should not use them . 
  there was a time where the european citizens got helped at the expense of african citizens . 
  no such thing as international law back then though . 
  the west will literally disappear in a few generations , this is equivalent to genociding european citizens guyz !, 
   or lose western europe within a few generations . 
  the melodrama is where you lose people . 
  the west is n't going anywhere , the vast majority of people in countries much more affected by refugees than poland do n't feel like the sky is falling and there is no political will from either the governments or the electorate to implement the kind of radical and inhumane solutions you are proposing in the richer countries where the problem is more pronounced . 
  or you know incredibly complicated and intricate international politics that are n't solvable by simplistic solutions thought up for a reddit post . 
  which from what i understand from his constitutional functions are far and large out of his hands . 
  but should someone who watches them out of curiosity , however morbid or weird , be detained if caught ? 
  portugal , italy , greece , austria ... did i miss any other country where the left is in power in europe ? 
  why does the left keep getting blamed for things they could n't do since it 's been almost two decades since they have been anything but a marginal political actor ? 
  it 's illegal internationally to deport someone to a country who does not want to receive that person . 
  otherwise middle eastern countries would also start dropping their criminals in our borders . 
  how dares a journalist not blindly trust one side or opinion and seek confrontational opinions or validate that what the group is doing is actually correct ? 
  is it their job or something ? 
  oh wait , it is !, 
  can we address the fact that it is enough for a posting to paint catalonia , barcelona or anything related to catalonia in a vaguely good light for it to get buried in downvotes ? 
  is there some brigade at work ? 
  edit : already downvoting just for noting this strange effect ... 
   china is the most hardcore capitalist country if it was n't the west would not be willing to make deals with them . 
  goal number 1 is to blockade and bring down any country who does not go the capitalist route . 
  they already have the libdems for ruthless capitalism with leftist social policies . 
  why are unions all opposed to his reforms then ? 
  it 's false . 
  well you 've come to the point where nations and states stand in the way of democracy to be honest . 
  the idea that people are somehow too dumb to make good decisions but smart enough not to elect stupid politicians is baffling especially when electdd politicians defend it . 
  do they realise they are claiming to be elected and chosen by a bunch of drooling idiots ? 
  that does not reflect well on them . 
  what 's the point of calling a referendum if `` taking the result in consideration '' means doing whatever the well you wanted to do to begin with . 
  this is the kind of thing that diminishes faith in democracies and makes people think the current politicians do not respect their sovereignty . 
  there can be only one logical conclusion to people who are against direct democracy but for representative democracy , and that is that elected officials should lie regularly to get elected because the public is just too stupid to vote for good policies . 
  it seems much less likely for a wide electoral base to shit the bed than for a appointed politician to shit the bed . 
  workers in sweden and denmark have hugely powerful unions with lots of rights enshrined in the law . 
  macron will go full union busting mode as soon as we field huge opposition to his labour reforms in the streets and block this country with strikes . 
  meet the new gang , same as the old gang except they are also coming for your job security and work rights . 
  en marche is socially liberal and economically hard-right . 
  the first is most definitely unconstitutional and reels of something a banana republic would consider doing . 
  i feel like i am in bizarro world lately where economy minister becoming president means there is a fresh face in the elysee and now apparently french german relations which have been solid with hollande always backing merkel up where suddenly shit for an entire decade . 
  until the problems voiced and silenced in may 68 are solved , it will remain a landmark . 
  if the target country wo n't take them and you hold them until they can leave , which they never can , you effectively condemned them to life in prison . 
  we will see and this time we will judge his capitalist policies on what they are , not on the last time where capitalist reforms failing kept being blamed on the fact we are still too socialist like hollande 's labour reform . 
  for worker 's sake i hope he does n't . 
  abandoning all hope though . 
  i 'm not sure i 'm seeing your point ? 
  how are they not confirming to the roles of the military by even wearing specific uniforms when they stop fitting the regular ones due to an health condition , since uniforms are expected of all military ? 
  this seems going above and beyond in trying to fit into what is expected .

i thought that would be us . 
  please keep quiet . 
  we are going deaf over here . 
  portugal has always been part of the west either geographically , culturally or politically . 
  you really should check some history . 
  you ca n't get more western than portugal . 
  that 's how i see it too . 
  come to portugal , 
  migrants also think that poland and hungary do n't exist . 
  hungary would only be a route to germany . 
  yet the far right movements are big over there . 
  me too . 
  i prefer ajax . 
  very true . 
  why would they be called expats ? 
  they should be called emigrants . 
  that 's what they are . 
  people emigrate to those countries because that is where people they know ( some other portuguese people ) are working . 
  most of them do n't choose those countries thinking about quality life or quality democracy . 
  people only think about making some money and then go back to portugal . 
  nordic countries are portrayed in portuguese media as the ones who have better educational systems ( finland ) and are most equalitarian . 
  those countries are not a very good example . 
  nordic countries are indeed perceived as being the most equalitarian . 
  switzerland and luxembourg do n't fit . 
  the `` pinnacle of western development '' would be the us . 
  mostly in a bad way . 
  i think `` western development '' is not positive . 
  the pinnacle of european ideals would be sweden . 
  in portugal , for example . 
  nordic countries are perceived as having the better quality of life . 
  beautiful, 
  the most common is moors ( mouros ) . 
  lisbon is moural\u00e2ndia . 
  `` russo '' means someone from russia . 
  `` ru\u00e7o '' is the word which also means blond . 
  `` ru\u00e7o '' comes from the latin word `` ruscidu '' . 
  first thing i could think of is chocolate . 
  once we get our empire back we may include you . 
  why the chick-pea ? 
  no cabbage ? 
  lol, 
  beautiful city . 
  triggered . 
  you are part of europe too . 
  in portugal it used to be baby jesus but father christmas took over . 
  beautiful . 
  brazilian ... 
  brazilian ... 
  brazilian ... 
  happy birthday , emma morano !, 
  yes . 
  i 'm not rich to go eat in a nice italian restaurant in touristic areas , i guess . 
  beringela in portugal . 
  i 'm not a fan . 
  i was n't such lucky . 
  i know there must be wonderful food in italy . 
  i was kidding , i know what an aubergine is . 
  in portuguese it is `` beringela '' . 
  thanks anyway . 
  i totally understand you , brother . 
  i do n't get all the fuss about italian cuisine . 
  i 've been to italy and all the restaurants were so damn expensive . 
  i spent the whole time eating pizza and burgers . 
  some other dishes i ate there ... meh, 
  i would rather have sausages and mash than a thin thin crispy pizza . 
  caldo verde and broa . 
  we introduced you to tea . 
  common in portugal too . 
  southerner here . 
  we also have blood sausages and they are delicious . 
  there 's some other dishes with blood like `` papas de sarrabulho '' . 
  `` papas '' is a popular expression for coagulated blood , so the literal translation would be `` mashed blood '' . 
  the soup is made with pig 's blood , chicken meat , pork , ham , salami , lemon , bread and is typically sprinkled with cumin , which provides to this dish a distinctive odor . 
  i agree with you . 
  the authentic galician sounds more like portuguese but it seems that there is a progressive influence of castillian in galician . 
  the deplorables . 
  i always feel welcome when i visit spain too . 
  we understand you quite well . 
  and we have `` portunhol '' . 
  galician is quite similar to portuguese . 
  `` galician-portuguese was first spoken in the area bounded in the north and west by the atlantic ocean , and by the douro river in the south , comprising galicia and northern portugal , but it was later extended south of the douro by the reconquista . 
  it is the common ancestor of modern portuguese , galician , eonavian and fala varieties . 
  the term `` galician-portuguese '' also designates the subdivision of the modern west iberian group of romance languages . '', 
  maybe our inquisition was softer . 
  you do n't have to be sorry . 
  it 's okay . 
  it is the way it is . 
  maybe i feel closer to galicians since i 'm from northern portugal . 
  i have never had that much interest in spain really . 
  it 's a beautiful country which i have visited numerous times though . 
  it 's a foreign country like any other country . 
  however i do feel more at home in spain than in italy or any other country , particularly in galicia . 
  i thought you were `` nuestros hermanos '' . 
  anyway i know what you mean . 
  in my opinion , we have never had no interest in spain . 
  we have always been looking to the atlantic ocean and definitely have closer ties to `` nossos irm\u00e3os '' in brazil and africa . 
  in portugal we also use the french one . 
  it translates into : quando as galinhas tiverem dentes . 
  and it has the exact same meaning . 
  me too then,

  i left there a post ... 
  europe should get rid of this shit ... nuclear plants are time bombs . 
  [ theory that germany was manipulated in recent past ] ( https://youtu.be/ewtx9bswvfu ), 
   the security debate is changing with calls for country to pull its weight militarily in about 10 days ' time the elite of the us and european defence and diplomatic establishment will gather in bavaria for the annual munich security conference . 
  sometimes it is an occasion for high diplomatic drama ; other times a chin-stroking gabfest . 
  this year , one senses there will be quite a lot to talk about . 
  at a time when many of the old certainties have been overturned , few questions seem inappropriate . 
  so in that spirit , i have one for those gathering in munich to consider : is it time for germany to go nuclear ? 
  simply entertaining the thought might seem grossly irresponsible . 
  the world , surely , has quite enough nuclear powers already . 
  also , history makes germany an unlikely candidate to join the club -- even if a fair number of the pioneers of the original atomic bomb were german \u00e9migr\u00e9s , thus making the country sort-of present at the creation of mass destruction . 
  german defence policy has long been characterised by restraint -- sometimes to the frustration of its allies -- and is obliged by international treaty not to take up nuclear arms . 
  this makes it all the more remarkable that the nuclear option is being countenanced in berlin , as part of a wider discussion about how germany might need to reposition itself in a fast-changing geopolitical environment -- one in which talk of a break up of the `` supranational '' eu or the `` obsolescence '' of nato is almost routine . 
  the spark for the nuclear part of this discussion was provided by the election of donald trump . 
  a few days ahead of the us presidential vote , an article in spiegel online asked whether , with the election of an american administration that may no longer care so much for europe or nato , germany might need to pursue its own , or a european , nuclear deterrent . 
  related article donald trump , nato and a strong transatlantic alliance it is high time for europe to take more responsibility for its security this was later echoed by roderich kiesewetter , a foreign policy spokesman in parliament for the ruling christian democrats and a former colonel . 
  he told reuters that if the us no longer wanted to provide a nuclear shield , then `` europe still needs nuclear protection for deterrent purposes '' . 
  a subsequent opinion piece by one of the publishers of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , germany 's conservative paper of record , made a similar case and suggested that it was time the country reconsidered things long deemed `` unthinkable '' . 
  it did not take long for the think-tank community and commentariat to weigh in . 
  some saw such views as the logical consequence of developments that could see germany left vulnerable in an increasingly dangerous neighbourhood , with a newly expansionist russia flexing its muscles to the east . 
  others maintained that it was reckless even to entertain such thoughts . 
  almost all observers have been quick to note that there is almost zero public support in germany for nuclear weapons . 
  even those who have raised the issue acknowledge this . 
  mr kiesewetter says that europe does not need another nuclear power . 
  he has talked instead about a european nuclear `` umbrella '' provided by the continent 's existing atomic powers , france and the uk , and possibly part-financed by germany . 
  other analysts note that germany 's more immediate defence requirements may lie in the area of trade , where the new us administration has identified berlin as the miscreant in a system supposedly manipulated to america 's detriment . 
  yet the very fact that this is being discussed at all is a further indication of how the german security debate is changing . 
  calls for europe 's biggest economy to pull its weight more militarily have been a feature of western defence discourse for years . 
  germany has responded , albeit cautiously . 
  past taboos about overseas deployments have been overcome . 
  defence spending is due to rise , and the need to modernise the armed forces is widely recognised . 
  now added to this are the disruptive changes threatened by brexit , the rise of populism and the election of mr trump . 
  in an extreme case , these could sever the moorings of postwar german foreign and security policy in europe and the western defence system . 
  in that context , thinking the unthinkable becomes more imaginable . 
  currency war against germany ? 
  ... this is pathetic , germany has the euro , a currency common to 19 countries . 
  how can you declare war to only one of this 19 countries ? 
  on the contrary . 
  never the forgotten regions of portugal got so much money/infrastructures to attract visitors or project their cultural inheritance elsewhere . 
  that \u00b4 s powerful, 
  one leg and feet can be social security , the other can be economy . 
  we all can lead, 
  we need to start internally ; all this antidemocratic , anti human , anti diversity trolls in europe and in this sub ; let \u00b4 s kick their asses first and teach them that europe doesn \u00b4 t need to be painted in monochromatic tone to be great in almost every aspect of human life . 
  if we stand together for values bigger than our little bellies , if we stand together for something that dignifies life , any kind of life , our enemies will simple fall like an house of cards . 
  romania !, 
  ... make europe great again . 
  let \u00b4 s kick some asses on the way there ... let \u00b4 s make europe great again !, 
  thanks for the post !, 
  lol, 
  yeah the weather ... can ruin my holidays , hard to believe it can damage the supply chain like this . 
  the propaganda that the uk economy is booming, 
  looks like the mask is falling ... cracks in the make up are starting to appear, 
  [ at the moment , the global financial system is centered on the united states but that will not always be the case . 
  ] ( https://www.dukascopy.com/fxcomm/blog/?action=post-show&amp;post_id=346 ) [ also ] ( http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/files/2015/12/01/currencybasket-01_0.png ) the dollar is losing ground to other currencies, 
   the point is countering the idea that the us has always been against the eu you were the only one who said this . 
  i didn \u00b4 t made an elaborated assertion on the subject , because i don \u00b4 t know enough to con-substantiate my position ; but what i said doesn \u00b4 t need to be said by someone who deeply knows the subject , it \u00b4 s common sense . 
  for starters it \u00b4 s a global financial system , meaning that crisis are all intertwined ; a financial crisis in europe is also a financial crises in the us and vice-versa . 
  second the us has to maintain a schizophrenic relation with europe ; in one hand the euro is a menace to the dollar as a reference currency , on the other hand the us wants and needs a stabilized eu . 
  you \u00b4 re strange ; you take my isolated comments on a limited part of a complex reality and extrapolate or generalized ... wtf is wrong with you ? 
  that doesn \u00b4 t make what i said not true . 
  the us economy profits a lot from the dollar as a reference currency . 
  laugh all you can while you can , because the last one to laugh always laughs better . 
  romania lead the way ... we need this here in portugal and in all eu capitals . 
  let \u00b4 s turn on the heat ... a lot of us have been frying for much to long . 
  since the euro creation the us is a threat to the eu ; the euro is a serious candidate to replace the dollar in world commerce ... this as always been a problem to the us . 
  nothing new here . 
  probably , but what can we do ? 
  ... when the majority chooses dead , one can only hope that not all of us going to be killed . 
  and people that i know , smart people , travelled and educated people , really think that protectionism is the only option here . 
  i don \u00b4 t see this ending well either way . 
  i don \u00b4 t think so ; one important sign of it is the economics ; traditional papers , news channels ... are bankrupted ; at least for what is known here in portugal . 
  they are only maintained working by large economic groups for propaganda purposes , but the fact that they alone are not viable is a sign of the end . 
  the mainstream media is in his last breath ... the beast is out of control , just stay back and watch her die . 
  this is a globalized world economy ; patriotism is good if you want to commit suicide ... you whether embrace change or are killed by it ( patriotism ), 
   what has trump done that threatens europe in any way ? 
  trump \u00b4 s rhetoric , as well from his supporters , portraits eu as a plot from globalist to take over the world ; trump is a man on a mission to take down globalists ... 
  someone should explain to trump and his supporters that the globalists are big corporations that profit the most from globalization . 
  lol, 
  no shit ; only the us ? 
  hey we have a nice strategy , so please show some respect . 
  last week some accommodated syrian refugees escaped to germany ... they must be giving free stuff , everyone wants to go there . 
  may should march out of here, 
  on the right column of this sub , there \u00b4 s and `` edit '' option next to your nickname . 
  what a great time to be alive ; the end of an era . 
  the rules i can see being violated by the use of the veil : - safety , not knowing what is being transported under the veil ; - is not a tradition , for now , to use this kind of outfit , makes people distrustful, 
  i don \u00b4 t get all this fuzz about the veil ban . 
  this is europe not a shit hole in the middle of the desert . 
  we have rules of good conduct and good practices that have to be followed by all new comers ... it \u00b4 s a matter of respect from the new ones to those already here . 
  what wave is he talking about ? 
  what an image ... beautiful . 
  i love my country , not the people , just the country, 
  people can be easily manipulated, 
  portugal \u2122 , kicking muslins asses since 1140 . 
  bullshit  is that a genuine feeling ? 
  the genuine feeling is `` not impressed '' by the bullshit  any concerns to add ? 
  wwiii is coming, 
  i \u00b4 m not going to answer that question . 
  i see an agenda of people trying to ignore some facts on the ground , whether they don \u00b4 t known it , because they don \u00b4 t live in eu , or they are part of some like minded people who prefer to only see some more convenient parts of the story , that corroborates there bias . 
  i \u00b4 m not saying eu hasn \u00b4 t problems , i would be a fool to say that , but i \u00b4 m not going to give my opinion to people i don \u00b4 t see serious ( not saying is your case here ), 
  did you took your pills today ?

  so you only want the part of the democracy that suits you best ? 
  you want to choose this , don \u00b4 t want that , exclude this one , include that one ... what a fuck is this ? 
  a joke ? 
   what do you do after they registered and start a mass migration to germany , now registered ? 
  let them go.i would try to provide alternative options to the migrants on their way , like accommodations and possible job interviews or job oportunities i \u00b4 m not here defending refugees ; to a lot of them there \u00b4 s no excuse to their attitudes , like dumping their kids or confronting the police . 
  this is people that desperate , came from war zones , different cultural backgrounds and need an attitude correction by the authorities . 
  that way it \u00b4 s important to separate the refugees , according to their menace level and deal appropriately . 
  nothing of this was done by the hungarian authorities . 
   hungary simply let the refugees through at the beginning , they were n't antagonized i \u00b4 ve read that large poster where exposed in hungary , telling the refugees to go away from hungary , that hungary doesn \u00b4 t want them . 
  orban leads a government that \u00b4 s more close to a russian fascist regime , than from a western prosperous democracy , and is using the refugee crisis , to manipulate hungary population on his behalf , inciting fears and reviving old traumas . 
  all this before the crisis took this proportions.the level of international criticism to hungary just tells how bad they are dealing with all this . 
  that \u00b4 s a good question . 
  i don \u00b4 t know if 95 % of the refugees don \u00b4 t want to register ; find it hard to believe . 
  one solution would be to open corridor trough the country ; people would walk , of would use convoys in buses or trains ; along this corridors it was needed check points ; this check points would have humanitarian help and registrations ; in this registrations you would have the first selection of refugees . 
  you don \u00b4 t needed all registered in the first check point they pass , but people who refuse to register would be arrested in probably , `` concentration camps '' style prisons ; this `` concentration camps '' would be a constant flash point to authorities , and here it \u00b4 s where i would like to see riot police in action ; not against helpless woman and children . 
  people would have to wait in this camps until they get registered or face deportation . 
  i don \u00b4 t believe families would refuse registration in his circumstances ... we only would see young man here ... that \u00b4 s why the riot police was good for a good old fashion education all this was possible in an organized society or government ; i don \u00b4 t think money would be a problem to this kind of implementation , brussels would give the green light for this operation , this is more the inability of the government to mount the operation . 
  hungary has been antagonizing refugees since the beginning , yesterday when we saw riot police against woman and children was the inevitable consequence of their lack of ability to tackle the problems, 
  that \u00b4 s what you think, 
  your level of incompetence it \u00b4 s behind words, 
  that \u00b4 s why i say eastern europe gives europe a bad name, 
  no , just bad parents ... like many others european parents . 
  hungary has a very good public image ... nice work . 
  you guys should stop recruiting greek \u00b4 s pr . 
  fuck the assholes, 
  this people are so racist that they refute even the basic facts of this crisis , presented in the video, 
  if you find how to help refugees don \u00b4 t forget to tell me . 
  there are 4 million syrian refugees outside syria , if we took then all , it would represent less than 1 % increase in the eu population ... irrational fears of what people don \u00b4 t know . 
  well equipped and trained hungarian police beats helpless women and children ... very dignifying, 
  lol, 
  this refugees represent less than 1 % of europe \u00b4 s population ; they don \u00b4 t represent a menace to the stability of the region , especially if they are scattered across the continent , and with real help on the ground to the integration process ; you \u00b4 re judging their reactions from our perspective ; they come from a very different cultural background , they are young and they are desperate . 
  their should be institutions in this eastern countries to make the registration process faster as the processing process to other countries and integration . 
  wow ... i \u00b4 m so afraid, 
  my opinion about your comments it \u00b4 s just you are retard and ignorant, 
  just a thought, 
   i imagine that portugal could send a ship over and take some of the people we \u00b4 re not xenophobic so bring them on ... we will do our part in helping easing the `` burden '', 
  so what \u00b4 s up with all those people behind the fence ? 
  i don \u00b4 t think they are being registered ... more barred, 
  for treating people people like shit , and not doing their job to register people who arrive . 
  europe has values, 
  eu needs to declare war on the v4 countries ... this is europe not a middle east shit hole or russia, 
  there you have millions of syrian , afghan , iraq \u00b4 s citizens watching german news and the first response to the invitations was to pack their things and their families and leave to germany ... all this in a mather of days and they already arrived to europe . 
  fascist need to came out with better stupidities to convince the masses . 
  nice move on the fence hungary ... there \u00b4 s no ways this will backfire ; smart move ** edit ** i was being sarcastic ... bring it on the downvotes avalanche now, 
   she sent an invitation to everyone and now a swarm of so-called `` refugees '' is invading europe . 
  do you really believe this shit ? 
  ... people spend months and years on this travel to europe ... wake up ; this it \u00b4 s just the beginning and has nothing to do with merkel invitations . 
  in your face \u00d3rban ... 
  what do you mean ? 
  people from other countries in war aren \u00b4 t refugees ? 
  people aren \u00b4 t going for this trip for some kind of game ... this people are desperate ; people need help , when they choose between dead in their countries and possible dead from the journey ahead ; dignity please, 
  `` it is a ruthless and inhuman game , playing with the lives of people fleeing one the worst conflicts in the world , for a little political gain . '', 
  i sincerely hope that countries like hungary will be putted in her place ... a very small corner in a very dark room, 
   it should be greece job to turn the boats away but we know the story turn away an overcrowded dingo ... bravo ; let them die , right ? 
  who cares anyway . 
  i like the repetition technique ... to emphasize the message, 
  arrest them and punishem ... guys in prisons have a little taste for rapist, 
  people already have worst animals than those in their countries ... actually they have born there, 
  people aren \u00b4 t stupid ; they can distinguish a bad apple from a good one , and avoid troubles for themselves by taking people in their houses, 
  6:00 am with that level of noise pollution ? 
  ... first thing the police should do is to stop that shit, 
  if schulz needs people to fight those shameful countries , i \u00b4 m in ... 
  europe \u00b4 s economic power it \u00b4 s already in decline for a time now . 
  if the people forget the values !!!, 
  ... what will be left of europe ? 
  they should be scattered all over cities . 
  putting them in ghettos it \u00b4 s the first step to don \u00b4 t integrate . 
  especially if they are putted in ghettos, 
  you didn \u00b4 t get my point ; the antagonizing attitude by the hungarian government towards the refugees was a shot in the foot , when the government needed their cooperation for the identification process , that willingness by the refugees wasn \u00b4 t there ... understandable ; and this it \u00b4 s even more ridiculous when the refugees didn \u00b4 t wanted to stay in hungary in the first place , hence the no reason to make refugees life harder in hungary . 
  but i guess orban it \u00b4 s too stupid to understand that . 
  the hungarian government has been antagonizing refugees all the time ; they are rebellious because they don \u00b4 t trust hungarian authorities . 
  and all the incompetents in the government hat to do was to let them pass . 
  the level of incompetence of this people it \u00b4 s beyond words ... maybe that \u00b4 s why not all countries are developed countries . 
  they are rebellion for a reason douchebag, 
  i respect germany ;, 
  is there more info on this ? 
  goodbye ... ? 
  are they going anywhere ? 
  you guys spend too much time indoors . 
  the technical name for it \u00b4 s dementia . 
  you should go out more often , and meet new people, 
  looks like they are doing a great job there ... pathetic, 
  portuguese it \u00b4 s a peaceful people . 
  we had our troubles in the past , but our african ex-colonies aren \u00b4 t near what other europeans ex-colonies are ; we also integrated well romans and ex-colonies people in our society . 
  syria it \u00b4 s a french ex-colonies , afghanistan an ex-british colonies ... and we all know what it \u00b4 s happening now in those countries . 
  besides , the rest of europe , including the eastern part it \u00b4 s responsible for the worst part in human history , like the 2 world wars . 
  so go back to the hole you came from, 
  eu firm response to this crisis is being deliberated sabotaged by some states, 
  eastern europe ... giving europe a bad name since ... ever incompetence it \u00b4 s king by those sides, 
  i wouldn \u00b4 t swap a thousand of ~ ~ you ~ ~ refugees for 1 ~ ~ refugee ~ ~ of you, 
  that too, 
  none, 
  any area with no industries ... industries fuck people \u00b4 s minds . 
  no it \u00b4 s not ... 
  i see 97 % whites everyday, 
  great more refugees ... millions of them !, 
  portugal, 
  only if we put people like farage in the boats, 
  doesn \u00b4 t he has a mirror in his house ? 
   are only useful after the fact or crime has been committed .

  then there 's the fact that you obviously do n't view dutch citizens with turkish ancestry or nationality as proper dutch , dog whistling at its best . 
  so erdogan is sending money to the dutch turkish population ? 
  still if anyone wants to donate their money on denk they should be able to do so ( in limited amounts of course ) supposing there is n't coercion by the turkish state to have those dutch turks act like an human offshore . 
  switzerland is balkan , it 's confirmed . 
  `` is n't switzerland in western europe ? '', 
  try hard swiss nationalist : `` uhm ackshually like all other balkan countries , switzerland is a melting pot of different nations , languages , religions ... '', 
  which means nothing because you ca n't have an institution like the eu without any delegation of sovereignty . 
  why should n't dutch turks be able to donate to a party in the netherlands ? 
  fortunely because the dutch political system is so fractured and wilders is n't reliable i do n't think pvv will ever get in power in the near future . 
  the problem is rutte using dog whistles in a letter `` to the people '' and others using wilder 's playbook . 
  so you vote for the clearly non democrat and demagogue ? 
  there was poll shortly after the inauguration where republican voters went something from 20 % to 70 % in favour of protectionism . 
  that party is stained forever . 
  the interesting in the netherlands is that populism is very active there not because of economic reasons but socio-cultural . 
  compared to the rest of the planet the dutch could n't be better . 
  also , one ca n't expect populism to wither , it 's intrinsic to liberal democracies . 
  i 'm reading it at the moment , it 's superb . 
  there 's 10 different basic variables between consensus and majoritarian , 5 in the executive-parties dimension and 5 on a federal-unitary . 
  i suppose your referring to majoritarianism as in the family of electoral systems , right ? 
  most arguments usually refer to the fact that it enables a clear cut winner and therefore a strong and effective government and the ideological weight of rousseau 's * volont\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale * . 
  to the end of the book lijphart shows how consensus based democracies have delivered better results than majoritarian based democracies . 
  i do n't see how it could be easier , their political systems are highly unstable and there is a much bigger difference between big and small states ( compared to the treaty of rome and subsequent eu evolution ) . 
  what apparently kaczynski did n't understand is that to follow the hungarian `` illiberal '' path you ca n't make waves and piss off everyone . 
  \u00d3rban managed to pass a constitution full of inovations , a clearly biased electoral system and remain in epp due to his cleaver maneuvering . 
  nonsense . 
  they have like 3 different unions and those are n't relevant . 
  add to that that giants like brazil are highly protectionist or the enormous ideological difference even in each `` wave '' . 
  bottled water . 
  immigrants are n't refugees . 
  nothing says more love for `` european values '' than going for taliban justice . 
  every single time . 
  it 's impossible to have exactly equal rights for women and men . 
  for example men ca n't abort and women ca n't perform like men athletes . 
  apparently it 's only feminism when it does n't bother . 
  i agree with you but i would n't say all of the right is against feminism or more action for women . 
  liberals or even christian-democrats do n't have the same actions and rethoric that of conservatives and far-right . 
  anti-feminism is one of the most widespread reddit circlejerks . 
  canton is n't hong kong , that would be modern day guangzhou . 
  actually it has to do with having a popularly elected president , the system is inherently majoritarian . 
  one seat is a zero-sum game ( it 's not possible to have pluralism ) . 
  what i love about zizek is how nationalists and racists use descontextualized quotes from him in order to vomit once again their bullet points . 
  people read the article . 
  ah good news then . 
  a victory for proportional representation . 
  last year you had a referendum where on of the proposals were to have a majoritarian two rounds electoral system , it did n't reach the quorum but did any of the proposals come to fruition ? 
  if they are bigoted and racist then it 's fair to call them out . 
  hillary did n't make them vote for trump . 
  everyone except the bolsheviks lost . 
  tell that to the `` southern provinces '' . 
  of course i get it , the far-right needs to weasel out their abhorrent core values in order to be relevant . 
  so does bill gates , is he also a dangerous commie ? 
  how is he authoritarian ? 
  even his ubi is n't universal ( at least in the first years ) . 
  that 's the measure that would be gutted first if he reached the elys\u00e9e . 
  apart from it i do n't see nothing `` hard '' on his rethoric or programme . 
  maybe for those who follow the center-right and right wing script that sounds like an impending bolshevik revolution . 
  with the right ? 
  of course , that 's why social democratic parties in europe have been vanishing . 
  let 's see : pasok , spd , psoe , pvda , irish labour , both ps 's in belgium , sp\u00d6 and this is only in western europe . 
  of course , people do n't vote for what fn members truly believe . 
  marine had to scale back a lot to reach a considerable electorate . 
  i 'm yet to understand on how `` hard '' applies to hamon . 
  it 's understandable to see how fillon might be `` hard '' ( neoliberalism amok or adopting the nativist and islamophobic rethoric from le pen ) but hamon really ? 
  he 's just a more leftwing psf candidate , more in line with social-democracy than vall 's hard centrism . 
  ironically this thread 's response only shows how populism and illiberal thought easily gets traction . 
  this sub is in a sad state compared to what it used to be . 
  yeah right . 
  and i suppose fillon is somehow center-right . 
  merkel is the epitome of the administrative short sighted politician . 
  i 'm yet to hear an inspiring or passionate speech by merkel with the exception of refugees . 
  meh it 's symbolic nothing will change . 
  i can see your point about the right proposing more condemning proposal about the responsibility of the soviet union but then again only naif people would expect stuff like this to divide pcp from the gov. 
  nope , this stuff was purely on the assembly . 
  it was neither a proposal from the gov nor influenced by it . 
  again nothing to do with the government , it was the parliament . 
  give juncker the job , president of the eu council is nothing more than a glorified spokesperson for national governments . 
  the government was n't involved in any of this . 
  nah i do n't buy it , our immigrants do n't have any political weight ( except africans and brazilians ) . 
  i think it 's really just being solidary with ukrainians . 
  that 's a given fact . 
  entering a supra-national institution and agreeing to certain rules ( as in having a non national military hierarchy or agreeing to help other members ) means you lose sovereignty . 
  i 'm myself not crazy about losing national sovereignty but i understand what consequences there are . 
  of i course i do n't know . 
  but i do n't see any alternative when the eu ca n't even coordinate a common foreign policy . 
  will the neutral irish or austrians enter a eu wide defense alliance even if that goes against their own constitutions ? 
  having inter army cooperation is very far from having an european commanding hierarchy . 
  the country loses part of it 's sovereignty in being the sole `` commander '' of its army . 
  even nato 's joint command does not have ultimate power to dictate what happens . 
  giving the eu military oversight ? 
  cmon do n't feign ignorance . 
  yeah but your political scene is riddled with religious undertones , that does n't happen here with the exception of a small conservative party . 
  and turkey is a bigger trade partner than armenia . 
  it 's pretty clear . 
  do n't know . 
  our tech sector is minimal and relies on low wages and a good propaganda effort by recent governments , the catholic background is fading and it 's nonexistent compared to ireland and about partying it 's very different from the usual southern european stereotype . 
  they are in the line of the majority of gue/ngl group , against `` this eu '' but for renovated europe . 
  of course it 's half not being openly eurospeptics ( like the far right saying they support a `` eu of nations , whatever that means ) half `` different cooperation between the peoples '' . 
  how are any of them left leaning ? 
  you can be conservative and repudiate trump , erdogan or putin 's russia . 
  just like saying polish death camps is n't wrong .

it 's just a petty regionalistic insult . 
  do n't think too much about it lol . 
  especially people in lisbon . 
  we northerners call everyone that lives below coimbra moors . 
  because when portugal was founded everything below that area was moorish territory . 
   moors vs the portuguese ftfy, 
  did n't humans originally come from africa ? 
  does n't that make us all african-something ? 
  this is why the `` african-something '' designation is ridiculous . 
  a thousand times this . 
  you can also make a lot more money from weapons by selling them rather than using them . 
  they have more bycicles to steal . 
  i 'd thank you but systems administration is a thankless job . 
  they truly are nuestros hermanos . 
  16th century high heels probably look like italy . 
  but the whole poland into space joke started in one of the early eu games . 
  there is a lack of `` cheese eating surrender-monkeys '' on this thread ( this is now fixed ) . 
  owned most of north africa at some point . 
  allways blobs into god mode in europa universalis . 
  hate the english , although that feeling is mutual . 
  napoleon had to invade portugal 3 times to truly defeat us . 
  still lost when the brits decided to send wellington . 
  you ca n't integrate a group of people that do n't want to be integrated . 
  but you can give them room to run their own society . 
  my coutry has a lot of deserted villages in the interior and a lot of gypsies living in social neighbourhoods or shanty towns . 
  we should take the gypsies living in these places and repopulate the countryside . 
  they get to live in their own society and everyone else gets to live in their own . 
  have n't you had enough of them ? 
  corelation does n't equal causation . 
  the hundred years war lives on eh ? 
  just make sure it 's the last thing . 
  your heart wo n't take it .

  well militarily at least . 
  the roman legionaire was created to defeat the phalanx/hoplite .

  sorry i do not know the full details of the finding . 
  all i know is that they rulled the law unconstitutional . 
  but that has n't stopped the government from going over the constitutional court 's head before and having the law aproved anyways . 
  the thing is that other than not showing up for work a civil servant can not be firered . 
  and portugal has way too many civil servants , far more than what it needs , so some need to be let go . 
   whatever floats your goat are floating goats a belgic tradition i know nothing about ? 
  i was hungry already !, 
  thanks a lot bavarian !, 
  no one says no to free food : /, 
  technically it 's not the highest court . 
  that would be the supreme court . 
  this court is the constitutional court who 's only job is to evaluate the constitutionality of new laws . 
  nothing cool like this ever happens in my country = /, 
  or bifes , as in pieces of delicious cow-meat . 
  probably because of the beef-eaters ... 
  actually there 's a trade surplus because there 's no money to import anything . 
  exports have n't increased significantly at all . 
  could n't we purpose build a city to be europe 's capital ? 
   it 's going to take a long , long time and a hell of a lot of money to rebuild syria when all this is finished . 
  * the cheney stirrs . 
  that mentality worked wonders for the league of nations . 
  never atribute to malice what may be adequatly explained by ignorance . 
  or gross incompetece in this case . 
  a\u00e7ores : they speak arabic . 
  we mainlanders ca n't understand a word they say . 
  madeira : corrupt as fuck . 
  love to spend our money on expensive parites and re-electing a virtual dictator for decades . 
  why would the us want to do anything that jeopardizes their hegemony over western world ? 
  it would be akin to the roman empire pulling out of britain . 
  dude , you know nothing of eu money wasting . 
  like building 3 paralel highways that sit empty , or investing in other unecessary infrastructure while the necessary bits sit in disrepair because you ca n't make corrupt contracts over them . 
  in portugal we have a kneedrome in f\u00e1tima , it 's like a race track for people that want to go kneeling arround the place . 
  not really . 
  we already pushed their shit in every time we fought them pretty much . 
  they know we ai n't nothing to fuck with . 
  i love watching you nords bash each other . 
  it 's the reason i come to / r/europe so often . 
  history shows portuguese military prowess is not to be underestimated . 
  [ joaquim de almeida is a bad bad man . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehy4f19z2o ), 
  if all you know of portuguese history is what you learned in school then it 's no suprise . 
  it 's super editorialized to make portugal look like the greatest country ever . 
  that 's because no one understands their messed up language . 
  it 's more the latter . 
  people in cities are usually more open minded than in the rural interior . 
  but that 's pretty standard for most countries i believe . 
  joaquim de almeida also played the bad guy in one of the fast and furious movies . 
  so is the summer if you do n't have ac . 
  it 's scorching suffocating heat . 
  sugestion : replace the short version of the national anthem you have there with the [ complete version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmnshtjcyh8 ) . 
  how about ... 
  the european union ? 
   obviously no brits want to join the euro . 
  are you sure ? 
  we could ask . 
  a referendum perhaps . 
  honestly it 's time the uk commits to the eu fully or gets out . 
  yeah it would suck if you guys started colaborating with this union you are supposedly a part of . 
  because a lot of europe 's trade is internal . 
  if , for example , portugal was n't such a bad country and it 's people had more disposable income , then we could buy more stuff made in france , germany and the uk , and thus those countries would profit . 
  sovereignty is over-rate imo . 
  i 'd rather be living under a more rich , fairly balanced , more centralizes europe than in shitty , corrupt , never getting better independent portugal . 
  independence is all well and good but you ca n't eat independence and independence is no roof to shield you from the elements . 
  ouch .

  now , all this self promotion means nothing but one thing to me . 
  when shit hits the fan , there 's at least a couple things i 'm pretty sure wo n't change - the brits ai n't going nowhere and neither are we . 
  we have close to 20 billion $ in gold ( in current gold prices ) or some 382 metric tonnes . 
  that hardly pays for a years worth of our politicians pay , performance premiums and expenses . 
  well , i never said which side we 'd be on . 
  `` the german genius '' , `` germany is the most grown-up country in the world today '' , `` german renaissance '' , `` people are envious of germany '' . 
  oh , this looks promising !, 
  nonsense , we 'll see you in the trenches . 
  as with everything * economics * . 
  being called a science is somewhat misleading . 
  it uses math , sure . 
  but at its heart lies nothing but ideology . 
  it holds no true natural laws , no universal constants and can not make use of controlled experiments to support its theories . 
  it 's all speculation read over mathematical interpretations that can simultaneously fit conflicting perspectives . 
  shoot up some randomness into the system and everything goes out the window leaving only the ideologues clinging to their fossilized thinking processes . 
  as for the article itself . 
  it 's a pleasant reading but it 's far from being relevant to the situation or the readers . 
  there are bigger problems that could easily be identified by simple math . 
  because , for the middle and long run , numbers just do n't add up , no matter how much you twist them . 
  we 're already past our expiration date . 
  democracy is dead for a long time but only now is the corpse starting to stink . 
  the eu has always been about protectionism and distorted ideals . 
  it was all `` here , join the eu , we 'll give you money to reform your country and in return , you 'll give it right back to our banking and industrial sectors '' . 
  that 's why it was so easily put forth for decades . 
  it allowed the further expansionist intents of the industry and banking sectors of the bigger countries . 
  now , those interests are set on another horizon . 
  whats coming for us is this neoslavery of everyone bellow the * banksters * social tier . 
  they 're collecting and they 're repossessing . 
  very few will be able to keep paying . 
  i also doubt the referred treaty changes are ever submitted , given the market behavior , let alone put in practice . 
  i say that same thing for those constitutional changes many countries are setting up . 
  enshrining deficit limits is ridiculous wishful thinking . 
  in an age where constitutional rights conflict and get trampled on by the many governments , it is really really infantile . 
  as for germany , i see germany playing their game , as always , protecting their own interests , their own agendas and bullying europe into submission . 
  they do n't anything that is n't in the interest of their elites . 
  good for the uk . 
  but bad also , because the uk is actually a nest of financial malpracticing . 
  if you track the global money trail , it leads to a lot of uk based mega-clusters . 
  what would take to solve the issue is real courage . 
  take on the need reforms announced on the treaty changes and apply them fast . 
  get rid of the unlawful lobbying . 
  clean all parties of it . 
  separate politics from capital . 
  it 's also infantile of me to expect it from these kind of characters ... they 've proven themselves quite well . 
  those are really low food prices !, 
  incredibly lower than here , where we have much less purchasing power !, 
  til ... 
  i 'm as frugal as they come but you 're not equating food diversity and energy costs . 
  cooking your own food is fine and i do it always , but you must diversify or you 'll be hurting soon ( health ) . 
  and take the added energy into account . 
  i can buy the cheapest spaghetti pasta for 50/60 cents ( it has steadily risen near 20 % these past months ) , salt for about 30 cents , rice for 1 euro ( also rising ) , canned beans and tomatoes are also way past 1 euro each for big cans . 
  i did the math and even with just soup and vegetables , i would n't sustain just myself on less than 170 euros food-wise . 
  just to put things into perspective , housing costs are 600 eur , energy/water ( gas+e lectricity + water ) are at 80 eur and rising . 
  daycare is another 150 eur . 
  food costs for a family of 3 are in the 400 eur . 
  all these have risen some 10 % this year and are due to rise even more with the changes in vat and interest rates . 
  social security taxation will add further strain to this coming year . 
  i have an old diesel car with low mpg ratio and little maintenance needed but the cost of a liter of diesel is pushing 1.50 eur . 
  there is hardly anything left on the family budget . 
  i know i 'll have to scrape something soon coming january . 
  i will probably start wearing a miners hat indoors to save energy . 
  i also suspect our government is planning to tax oxygen in order to pay their wallstreet like salaries and shady deals with their crooked friends . 
  that 's 4 $ a day !, 
  so , are you jesus christ ( multiplier of bread and fish ) or you are feeding yourself in socialized school cafeterias ? 
  some shelter for homeless people ? 
  could you please elaborate on that ? 
  because i live in one of the cheapest countries in europe food wise , and find that hard to believe . 
  what really should be graphed here are the work hours put in by corporate and company managers , state and private . 
  also , `` salvaged '' bankers and specially those in legislative seats like those elected for parliament , ministers , state secretaries and also judges of all instances . 
  but , yet again , the pawns that get all the focus . 
  if anything , this graph proves the real issue is competitiveness and not productivity . 
  does any guardian journalist dare tread such murky swamps ? 
  it will be at their doorstep soon enough . 
  it will also be too late , though . 
  it 's a shame , because the german people are unknowingly playing the * banksters * game of taking over the world . 
  and all of this due to the propaganda of lazy southern europeans versus the hard working northern europeans . 
  i find an uncanny similarity between germany and the sub-prime crisis . 
  while it lasted , the sub-prime , much like the eu integration model , was apparently good for everyone . 
  everybody had credit to buy and the markets apparently thrived with all this surge in forwarded debt , as did the german industry with the sudden explosion in purchasing power of this upcoming middle class in their easy to access markets . 
  people who would have difficulty paying their new homes got them anyway and were even encouraged to . 
  in europe , so did many governments embarked on this , `` encouraged '' to modernize their countries . 
  military contracts poured , large infrastructures , railways , steel , concrete , oil and overall consumerism . 
  this made some countries , particularly those with high industrial output , very dominant and successful . 
  then came the harsh mathematical reality and there you have it , people and countries going belly up . 
  a lot of song and dance and straight refusals to acknowledge the roots of the problem and dragging it ad nauseum at the expense of all the eu citizens and taxpayers . 
  this kind of problem should n't even have arisen if the true spirit of the post-war eu was still alive along with some sense of justice or even common sense !, 
  ms merkel and mr sarkozy should delete themselves from the history books . 
  they are literally playing the eu for saps and their short shortsightedness is infuriating . 
  the markets play them like puppets . 
  the eu is now the world 's weakest link because it has the weakest politicians - greedy , stubborn and far from the bright and lucid minds that once shaped the eu . 
  country after country will fall because of this warped sense of ethos sweeping the continent . 
  out with them , now !, 
  but it 's late and the democratic prozac does n't favor blitz politics . 
  it 's already geared to fail so brace yourselves , winter is definitely coming for us . 
  the upcoming suffering and death toll will be on their hands . 
  and do n't laugh . 
  it may seem a bit of a stretch , but the eu is all that stands between dialogue and war ( and what a whole new level of war it could be ) . 
  it may not come right away , but it will come , and not just from within our borders . 
  i find an uncanny similarity between germany and the sub-prime crisis . 
  while it lasted , the sub-prime , much like the eu integration model , was apparently good for everyone .

  our country , like many others , was built on bloodshed and prospered on bloodshed . 
  but still we acknowledge the good that our kings and queens did , neverming how many they killed . 
  we 've had many kings that were far far worse than salazar . 
  but they belong to the past and nobody has connections to that bit of history anymore , and when we talk about them the emotion is gone and we can see more clearly . 
  he was an intelligent and accomplished person in his field , he was a patriot and a hard line catholic . 
  [ this was his idea of the ideal family ] ( https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zqkyedsivca/vxtnexxzeki/aaaaaaaaopc/e1gdvfe2vis-8s3qxqs-sw53kmdefblqaclcb/s1600/l2.jpg ) , on the top right it reads : `` the lesson of salazar '' and in the bottom left : `` god , fatherland , family : the trilogy of national education . '', 
  so you 're starting to get the picture of the sort of person he was . 
  he kept portugal out of ww2 , something he is rightfully credited with , by playing and appeasing both sides . 
  we let the allies use the lajes air base in the azores ( under threat of a hostile take over instead ) and traded tungsten to the germans which was used for ammunition . 
  theres is no question that this was a good thing for the country . 
  he also got portugal out of a serious economic tight spot , however the way he did it was questionable as rationing was prevalent and there was an infamous need of a permit to carry a lighter . 
  freedom was very limited , public displays of affection were punished with fines and large gatherings were forbidden . 
  political dissent was punished with prison and exile , a case or other where a political opponent was assassinated , it was a dictatorship so nothing new there . 
  the colonies were denied independence and the regime strongly pushed the idea of the massive size of portugal and its overseas holdings as propaganda . 
  the fact that there was no talks about a slow move towards independence like in some british colonies eventually led to the war of the ultramar which ended with a [ peaceful ] ( http://www.grupoescolar.com/galeria/fotos/9f9dc.jpg ) military coup ( after salazar was long removed from power ) on the 25th of april of 1974 aptly denominated as the carnation revolution . 
  after the war the portuguese citizens were expelled from the colonies and returned to portugal itself leading to a crisis due to the massibe influx of people . 
  he had a stroke and fell of a chair incapacitating him , they let him believe he was still running the country for a bit and then made it official . 
  this happened not that long ago and a lot of what i know was told to me by my family members , and when i talk about this sort of stuff i count myself lucky that i can speak my mind without having to look over my sholder . 
  in sum salazar benefitted the country somewhat by saving it from war and fixing the economy ( through questionable means ) , but to do this he sacrificed the freedom of his people , kept them in poverty , isolated from the world that was n't portugal and in the end lost the empire anyway . 
  he certainly was n't evil , and he wanted the best for his country but he is somene who hurt a lot of people , caused a lot of suffering and is in no way someone anyone should look up to . 
  after capturing a merchant ship supposedly belonging to a wealthy indian lord from calicut instead of puting the ship and the pilgrims returning from mecca up for ransom he instead beggan transferring the cargo over to the portuguese ships and then set the ship on fire with all the pilgrims locked in the hold . 
  supposedly it took days to sink completely and any survivors were speared by portuguese soldiers on longboats . 
  estimates say that around 300 people died , this was done as vengeance for the massacre of calicut , in the end though the ship apparently belonged to the sultan of egypt anyway . 
  this is from wikipedia as its far more detailed than my memory : bombardment of calicut edit october 25 , 1502 - fleet departs cannanore . 
  chroniclers differ a little on the subsequent sequence of events . 
  while still in cannanore , gama had sent pedro afonso de aguiar to calicut in advance , with the warning that he had come to settle scores for the mistreatment of cabral and to get compensation for the overruning of the calicut factory in 1500 . 
  in response , the zamorin of calicut sent back a string of messengers to cannanore ( and along the way to calicut ) , each delivering promises that the zamorin was willing to settle matters with gama , and compensate the portuguese for the loss of their factory goods . 
  on the other hand , gama also receives a message from gon\u00e7alo gil barbosa , the portuguese crown factor in cochin , warning him that it was all a tactical ruse , that the zamorin of calicut had also dispatched a circular letter to all the lords of the malabar coast instructing them to close their ports and markets to the portuguese . 
  october 29 , 1502 - gama 's large armada finally arrives before the harbor of calicut ( calecute , kozhikode ) . 
  the zamorin dispatches an emissary , a brahmin ( dressed as a christian friar ) on a boat to gama . 
  the brahmin reports that the zamorin had arrested twelve of those responsible for the 1500 riot , and offers a peace and friendship treaty and the opening of a discussion of the restoration of the trade goods seized from the portuguese factory , albeit noting that the zamorin has also suffered property damages from portuguese actions and that he intends to deduct it from the final account . 
  gama is angered , feeling that the zamorin has changed his tone from his earlier messages , and demands the property taken from the factory be restored in full and brought to his ship , and that all muslim merchants must be expelled from the calicut , before any discussion about a treaty begins . 
  while awaiting the zamorin 's reply , gama seizes a nearby idling zambuq and some fishing boats that had unwisely ventured into calicut harbor , taking some fifty fisherman captive . 
  this action evidently angers the zamorin , who sends a stern reply to gama , noting that gama had already taken severalfold times more property from calicut ships , and slaughtered ten times more of his citizens ( on the miri , etc. ), 
  than the portuguese lost in the 1500 riot . 
  despite being the net sufferer and the clamor of his citizens for revenge , the zamorin is prepared to forgive and forget and start anew . 
  the zamorin also replies that calicut is a free port and he has no intention of expelling ` the moors ' . 
  moreover , the zamorin orders gama to release his ` hostages ' , that he will not subject himself to negotiation conditions and that if gama is unhappy with his offer , then he should leave calicut harbor at once , for the zamorin has not given him permission to anchor there , or at any other port in india . 
  october 31 , 1502 - infuriated by the reply , gama sends out a strongly worded ultimatum , declaring that the zamorin 's permission means nothing to him , that he has until noon the next day to deliver the portuguese factory goods to his ship . 
  gama uses this overnight interlude to send his boats out to sound the harbor of calicut to find optimal firing positions . 
  that same night , calicut forces set about frantically digging entrenchments , erecting a protective timber palisade and laying cannon along the harbor shore . 
  november 1 , 1502 - at noon , having received no reply , gama orders that his malabari prisoners be strung up by their necks from the shipmasts , allocating a few to each ship . 
  calicut crowds approach the beach to watch the grisly spectacle . 
  then the armada advances into the harbor and opens fire . 
  the bombardment is principally aimed at clearing the beach and trenches . 
  the malabari shore cannons are too few , their range and power too weak , to provide an effective reply . 
  the bombardment continues until nightfall . 
  that night , the corpses of the hung malabaris are taken from masts , their feet and hands severed off and sent by a small boat to the beach , with an insulting message to the zamorin , including a demand that the zamorin reimburse the portuguese for the powder and shot expended on destroying his city . 
  november 2 , 1502 - the city bombardment resumes the next morning . 
  the mostly poor dwellings on the shore having been razed the previous day , the portuguese cannons now have a clear view of central city and the statelier homes of the richer citizens of calicut and bring their larger ordnance to bear . 
  the city is relentlessly bombarded all morning - some 400 large rounds and an indeterminate number from the smaller caliber guns . 
  at noon , when the portuguese pause for lunch , a small group of malabari vessels tries to attack the idling squad , but are quickly seen off . 
  november 3 , 1502 - barros reports that the two-day bombardment had sufficiently crippled the city that several of the captains urge gama to authorize a landing of troops to sack calicut . 
  but gama , still hopeful the zamorin might come to terms , turns down their request , believing a sack would only escalate matters to the point of no return . 
  so , the next morning , vengeance satisfied , gama sets sail out of calicut harbor . 
  [ in his somewhat different account , gaspar correia does not report the hanging of the prisoners ; instead , after the bombardment , while still anchored before the harbor of the smoldering city , the 4th armada captures a coromandel merchant convoy of 2 large ships and 27 small boats unlucky enough to turn up at calicut at that very moment . 
  seizing the convoy , gama orders the cargoes transferred , the crews tied , their teeth beaten out , their noses and hands cut off and the ships set alight . 
  the brahmin emissary ( still being held by the portuguese ) is sent back to shore with a bag full of severed hands and a note for the zamorin telling him to `` make a curry out of them '' . 
  the violent treatment meted out by vasco da gama sends shockwaves throughout the malabar coast . 
  merchant ships in indian ports hurriedly leave the area or go into concealment . 
  all shipping along the coast essentially freezes . 
  ------ there 's also the story of when he declares a messanger to be a spy and cut of his nose and ears and sewed on a pair of dog ears and a snout as a replacement and sent him back . 
  supposedly he was also a pirate or a corsair before his `` break out role '' . 
  the portuguese presence in the indian ocean in general can be described as one of the great historical dick moves and a mass scale protection racket . 
  there 's some more neat stories about vasco da gama in his wikipedia article if you 'd like to take a look at those too . 
  maybe vasco da gama , he was a bit of a dick, 
  not so well regarded in portugal because of the whole invasion thing, 
  how 's the 18th century ? 
  spain or italy , i really appreciate the shared cultural elements of the southern european cultures . 
  plus , ca n't give up the great beaches and weather . 
  i think you 'd lose a lot of your time travelling and then being so tired because of it that you would n't enjoy the place you would be in as much . 
  i 'd advise sticking to one or maybe two countries that border each other and make the most of it . 
  i 'd like to see an european federation some day . 
  a single country ? 
  that tier idea sounds like it 'd piss off southern and eastern europeans while also being less efficient than using english, 
  literally , are you sure ? 
  denmark and portugal are two examples of the opposite that first come to mind . 
  i 'm sure there 's more true nation states . 
  oh yeaaah , completely forgot about those, 
  they 're nonexistent , thankfully, 
  i think one way or another its time for the american empire to end, 
  we have one for the copper ( ? ), 
  coins , `` pretas '' ( blacks ) . 
  because the older ones always have a dark patina, 
  on par, 
  i have a stove top deep frier , its aight . 
  i live in a city , i see them every time i got past the centre . 
  sometimes when they 're patrolling . 
  i know of them but i do n't see then anywhere else but on the internet , i do n't hang out with kids or teens so i might not be the best source . 
  we do n't have a significant amount of filipinos here , so i do n't believe there is any general opinion regarding them . 
  as for other asians , if you see an asian person that is n't a tourist you can safely assume they 're chinese as they are by far the largest asian minority . 
  overall i 'd say the opinion on them would be neutral , they tend to be regarded as hard working and smart but there 's also some very nasty rumours ...

  why not ?

i understand and agree with your points . 
  i too wish people would be less materialistic . 
  not by chance i love going to / r/latestagecapitalism and / r/simpleliving . 
  however , people wo n't really take your points and ponder about them if you tell them so aggressively . 
  i understand that you might not care about making them think about life , though . 
  i understand your point , but you are n't going to win anyone over or even be understood if you communicate like that . 
  i still think the main reason is the economic condition and lack of job security in this new age of capitalism . 
  what you are right about is that part of it is also on the culture , as it 's becoming significantly more individual . 
  there was a cultural shift about family and children that did n't exist in times past . 
  still , i 'd maintain the focal reason is `` no jobs '' or insecure ones . 
  he was very clearly joking and barroso also fucked us over , so you wo n't see anyone `` proud '' of him . 
  besides , who the fuck is proud of someone else working at goldman sach , they are like the company everybody hates . 
  i did n't downvote , but i also did n't upvote , so all it takes is one troll . 
  i 've compensated now . 
  though my joke was kinda aggressive now that i read it again , so i understand why you were confused . 
  with enough effort and dedication , it will always fit . 
  wait , what are we talking about ? 
  did i seem offended ? 
  i 'm sorry i seemed offended , i just wanted to joke back . 
  i doubt she can distinguish most of us though , unless she 's spanish/portuguese herself . 
  if you were raised by sitcoms , yeah . 
  married couples fuck a ton . 
  [ this is the most portuguese picture you 'll ever get to see ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ma2nntt.jpg ), 
   brit girls have a thing for ** attractive ** non-brit guys in general . 
  there , i fixed . 
  that should be enough for you to figure out why you were n't aware . 
  yeah , why does n't greece just lift itself up by it 's own bootstraps !, 
  i was right in the thick of it the whole time , i 've read all there is to read . 
  you should try stopping your shitty southern european phobia , before commenting on any topic . 
  greece wanted to leave , you just did n't allow them too . 
  it 's interesting to see the same pressure is n't being put on u.k. 
  you are right about everything you said in that comment . 
  i was replying to what you said here :  the school wants to make it equal by banning all religious practice because you are there to learn not pray . 
  you seemed to have been defending this attitude , but i can see you were just concerned about logistic matters . 
  i agree , the religious practices should not be an inconvenience to the classes or school finances . 
  see that just reeks of ignorance to what `` praying '' is to the different religions . 
  muslims ca n't just `` pray in their head '' . 
  it 's a physical prayer . 
  the schools are held to social contracts as well , they ca n't enforce religious discrimination ( and i do n't mean just discriminating towards one religion . 
  if you discriminate towards all religions , that 's still religious discrimination ) . 
  honestly , i do n't understand why this would be so complicated . 
  as long as it 's not inside lessons and not damaging/inconveniencing anyone else , what does it matter if they put a mat down at the patio outside ? 
  i concur with secularism . 
  i think you should re-read my post . 
  i 'm not saying secularism is bad , i 'm saying you should n't overreach it . 
  there 's a different between saying `` you ca n't pray while inside the class on ongoing classes '' to `` you literally can not practice your religion inside the school building regardless of having breaks and lunch breaks '' . 
  the latter is what the * commenter * above was defending . 
  `` you are there to learn '' , sure inside the classroom . 
  give students some freedom during their free time , though . 
  btw , as a european , that last chapter sounded like a parody . 
  each country is what it is , only americans treat europeans as a single identity . 
  it seems that that would greatly please some of the commenters on this thread , though . 
  it 's okay to apply that rule during classes , not `` school hours '' . 
  the title and article itself are just incredibly misleading , though . 
  my reply was directed at the commenters above and not at the article or the school director . 
   the school wants to make it equal by banning all religious practice because you are there to learn not pray . 
  i mean , this is n't very realistic no ? 
  you 've never had breaks in school ? 
  you are there to learn when you are in classes . 
  whatever harmless thing you do during breaks and lunch hour , should be up to you . 
  so you ca n't have any personal time while in the school ? 
  you are aware kids spend 8 or more hours per day on a school building , right ? 
  if they are not interrupting classes , there 's no reason to ban them from doing harmless things during non class hours . 
  it 's like if a school banned you from searching facebook in the hallways , because `` you are there to learn '' and you should do that other personal stuff in `` your own time '' . 
  they are all being equally treated in a shit manner , though . 
  schools should n't ban prayer , definitely not all together . 
  schools are supposed to be secular , not anti-theist . 
  does n't 100 % explain this economical phenomena but it was interesting anyway . 
  thanks . 
  it did explain that once they reach the peak , they can shut down the renewable energies from production but the coal and nuclear power just keeps on chugging . 
  however , i wanted to understand why they still need to pay customers to use the energy , why they ca n't just either store it or give it away for free and trash the rest . 
  i presume trashing it is more expensive than paying people to use it , however that works . 
   pay them to take our energy do you have a source on that ? 
  i 'm curious on how that works . 
  is `` trashing '' energy that expensive ? 
  they should have just copy pasted to practically every other country then . 
  lol , just act like you did n't go into a full muh freeze peach tantrum five seconds ago then , be my guest . 
  glad i could help , kind gentle free sir of the free internet !, 
  do n't hold on those incredibly grounded and well thought out opinions of yours , backed up by minutes of thinking while stuck on a toilet . 
  i 'm sure the earth will benefit greatly from all of them !, 
  you were making shit jokes about a sensitive topic and got mad that someone grounded your shit joke in reality . 
  nobody said anything about censorship , feel free to keep doing you . 
  i want just wanted to give you some food for thought on the consequences your jokes might have . 
  some us like to think about the consequences of our actions , i 'd just like to invite you into that group . 
  there 's nothing relative about the morality of colonialism , my friend , that was a indeed a good one . 
  there are 14 year olds reading this thread that do n't understand sarcasm and their views are being shaped by your jokes . 
  the 4chan experiment should prove enough already . 
  it 's still pretty ignorant . 
  we could try to stop taking advantage of a privileged status in an economical system that is * intentionally competitive * , for example . 
  i too do n't think it 's fair to be mad at modern europeans for colonialism , but if we refuse to change the economic system , when it only works when everyone can compete ... 
  seems particularly unfair to those countries , no ? 
   obama , hillary 's state department , those and other western powers as well . 
  who voted for them ? 
  remember i said brexit voters and other people in europe and the us . 
  it seems like you are purposefully trying to not understand my point . 
   all opinions are equally valid in my opinion , that is not true !, 
  just because you do n't understand an argument , it does n't make it a strawman . 
   nobody is arguing against the cause of the problem here . 
  i 'm arguing that they 're bringing problems with them that brexit voters do n't want in their back yards . 
  and i 'm telling you that the problem was created by the brexit voters ( and many other people in other european countries and the us ) and now they have to deal with it , not ignore it .

  however , they are divorced and jaime is no longer a member of the royal family . 
  she * did * study at exeter but i ca n't vouch for what people call her . 
  with regards to her son , joy has a light soir\u00e9e just like every other club in spain that is for underage . 
  i assume that 's where he worked but if not that is indeed stupid on everyone 's part . 
  also botswana does n't have a king . 
  i still do n't think that makes a case for ( male preference ) cognatic primogeniture . 
  [ according to wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/line_of_succession_to_the_spanish_throne ) , it seems the infantas abdicated any pretension to the throne and the law will be changed as soon as don felipe has a son . 
  ah i see , well that should be changed obviously . 
  source ? 
  you only have to look across the border to know a parliamentary republic does n't work in countries with problems regarding corruption . 
  ( same with italy where it 's more expensive and yet another source of corruption ) . 
  i 'm liberal and federalist but there really is n't a better alternative to a secular monarchy if we are to have a ceremonial leader . 
   in its crown the male has preference over the female , but also says that are men equal in rights to women . 
  not true , next in line to be monarch is felipe 's eldest daughter . 
  still cheaper than a republic .

  oh god , i 've specifically said that they did n't directly cause the eu crisis . 
  are you reading something i 'm not writing ? 
  they caused the financial crisis which contributed massively to the world recession . 
  this is what rocard is saying . 
  there are financial incentives to create economic `` disorder '' . 
  that 's it . 
  and yes the developed world [ * is * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_recession ) in recession or lower than average growth at the moment . 
  a ) financial crisis + b ) eurozone crisis = c ) world recession ( of which we are still in as i linked you ) cause of a ) us + uk financial institutions therefore , factor of c ) = uk financial institutions . 
  * obviously * there is a vested interest in selling high risk derivatives as low risk . 
  i do n't think i can spell it out for you any clearer . 
  portugal , spain and greece 's issues were entirely unrelated to the euro/eu . 
  they were/are internal structural issues mainly linked with corruption . 
  the financial crisis on the other hand was created by investment banks , of which london has the biggest hub in europe/the world . 
  this happened [ in 2008 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/financial_crisis_of_2007%e2%80%9308 ) this , along with the eurozone crisis , which is a seperate thing that happened [ in 2010 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_sovereign_debt_crisis ) and other factors , led to the current '' [ great recession ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_recession ) '' . 
  so yes , the uk is partly responsible for economic recession the world is currently observing . 
  and the city has come out better than it was before so obviously there is a vested interest from the financial world in creating profitable situations like these , which are not what countries want . 
  this is what he was saying and it 's correct . 
  thermal solar power does work at night , especially when using salts . 
  when denmark has wind , so does germany . . 
  anyway , the solution is there , it 's the country that ca n't take advantage of it . 
  financial disorder , along with the us yes they did , look at what happened to northern rock , lloyds , etc. 
  this affected the world 's financial state and therefore the euro . 
  * geothermal [ is n't as experimental ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geothermal_energy#economics ) as you make it seem , it really is worth exploiting more . 
  * as for solar and wind , have you seen the newest episode of cosmos ? 
  the fact that they 're expensive in portugal is n't the technology 's fault . 
  thermal solar power does n't have the intermittency issues of regular pv cells . 
  wind has a [ lower capacity factor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermittent_energy_source#terminology ) of course but they should all be used together , so really it 's not that much of a problem i do n't think . 
  * gen iv nuclear plants can actually [ use nuclear waste as fuel ] ( http://gizmodo.com/5990383/the-future-of-nuclear-power-runs-on-the-waste-of-our-nuclear-past ) .

   maybe take a page out of merkel 's book maybe not . 
  `` the economy of the eu would fall '' ? 
  what does that even mean , that all the other countries in europe would become bankrupt because the uk decided to leave or would the eu as an institution have less funds ? 
  i want the uk to leave because it 's clearly not in the uk 's plans to become part of a federal europe , which is the point of the eu . 
  we 'll do just fine without the uk , on the other hand , the uk might not be able to say the same thing . 
  as in why do i think they will or why do i want them to ? 
  yet another reason for you to leave , fantastic . 
  it 's very clear that the uk does n't want the eu and i 'm perfectly ok with that . 
  yeah you might vote to stay unfortunately . 
  hear that , farage ? 
  no no no , it 's okay . 
  that 's a good argument for further political unification . 
  there is [ at least gas ] ( http://www.publico.pt/ciencias/jornal/os-vulcoes-de-lama-do-golfo-de-cadis-e-as-ameijoas-gigantes-que-la-vivem-26022174#/0 ) off our coast and it 's pretty much [ given that oil exists . 
  ] ( http://www.psd-algarve.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=219&amp;catid=1:noticias&amp;itemid=11 ) i know alqueva was 70 years too late but that 's no reason to not take advantage of it . 
  we still have wind , solar , wave production and if we can change that stupid law , nuclear since [ we have reserves ] ( http://publico.pt/ciencia/noticia/investigadores-analisam-residuos-das-minas-de-uranio-portuguesas-1162177 ) . 
  like you said , untapped geothermal in a\u00e7ores too .

  * no natural resources ? 
  there 's plenty of [ oil and gas off the coast of algarve . 
  ] ( http://www.publico.pt/economia/noticia/repsol-assina-contrato-de-exploracao-de-petroleo-e-gas-no-algarve-na-proxima-sextafeira-1517334 ) we have europe 's only deep-sea port ( sines ) , europe 's biggest artificial lake with a massive dam ( alqueva ) , the entire tejo valley , incredibly fertile ground ( alentejo ) , lots of hydroelectric potential in the north , the 10th largest eez in the entire world , the a\u00e7ores islands ( geothermal and scientific haven ) etc. 
  * our population is [ becoming well educated ] ( http://gpseducation.oecd.org/countryprofile?primarycountry=prt&amp;treshold=10&amp;topic=eo ) believe it or not , we just ca n't retain it like you say so there 's something we could do . 
   state actively discourages private investment and new businesses . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i did n't know the state did this , i know it 's impossible to get capital in portugal at the moment though but we still have [ a good environment for start-ups ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-05/lisbon-s-heart-is-in-san-francisco-style-startups.html ) . 
  * absurdly slow and ineffective justice . 
  agreed , so we need to reform it yesterday . 
  * high taxes ... 23 % corporate tax is n't bad at all , but the vat is too high yes .

  it 's not that difficult , it 's called supply-side reform . 
  [ michael porter told us what to do step by step in 1994 and the results were obvious ] ( http://www.publico.pt/economia/noticia/portugal-precisa-de-um-novo-relatorio-porter-que-aponte-os-caminhos-da-reindustrializacao-1586584 ) . 
  we need that again . 
  but obviously , [ our socialist governments has kept any chance of that happening well hidden ] ( http://www.publico.pt/economia/noticia/michael-porter-arrasa-sete-anos-socialistas-130570 ) ( see the date on that ) . 
  the issue here , in my opinion , is that a republic [ does n't propose an improved alternative ] ( http://www.royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/opinion/why-the-arguments-for-a-republic-are-an-insult-to-the-intelligence-31835 ) ( i do n't agree with the title of that article by the way but with the general content ) . 
  monarchies such as spain 's rely on democratic approval and are subject to change to a republic if the people want . 
  also if you think about it , the country would n't exist had it not been for the particular ancestor of the monarch . 
  that 's not a reason on it 's own but it supports why it should be that particular person and not another to be carry the burden of being the head of state . 
  no worries . 
  i mean [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-clericalism#portugal ) and [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_october_1910_revolution#anticlericalism ) . 
  it was very healthy in my view to separate church and state . 
  no such thing as religious oaths , religious tax exemption , preferential treatments , etc. 
  which i think would have taken longer had the monarchy survived . 
  in recent years more monarchies are de-establishing religions from state functions like for example in [ sweden ] ( http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/01/local/me-49706 ) and the netherlands but with a vocal and strong minority of portuguese people being catholic , i doubt that our monarchy would have done that in the beginning of the 20th century . 
  fun fact : the monarchy was ousted in a terrorist act by freemasons without public support ( i think only something like 7 % wanted a republic at the time ) as the king was [ very popular ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carlos_i_of_portugal ) and known for his academic prowess and humility . 
  you can see pictures of the `` rebels '' parading [ carbon\u00e1ria flags .

  mcdonalds needs humans to sell food , the human factor is essential . 
  to produce the burgers not so much , but then again too many variables ?

  god , we are so corrupt . 
  euros e c\u00eantimos . 
  no no , portugal 's flag has a sphere in the center that encloses the national shield . 
  it is common to represent the flag as green yellow and red . 
  if uk leave it opens a precedent . 
  either to throw countries out or to leave at first turbulence . 
  i sure hope that , my country can not provide me space to improve , in fact they are cutting my choices for specialisation ( i am a doctor , very fresh one ) , and i really wanted to follow a field but my only option might be abroad . 
  it makes me sad to see the spirit of eu crushed by ... eu itself , but let us hope . 
  all good to you also my friend , feel free to visit portugal anytime , 
  that yellow is just because of you know * coff * , to match our flag center yeah , * coff * yeah that 's it . 
  i am proud . 
  * walks away crying like a teenage girl *, 
  ukip , that guy that is always with a beer in is hand . 
  yeah sound like some politicians we have now , similar to the ones in italy ( they say popular things , gain votes , bad things happen next ) . 
  i think the mp system is different , we vote for parties and they assign places in the parliament . 
  they are trying to change the system and make us vote for the person and not for the % . 
  currently we have no saying whatsoever in who goes to the parliament . 
  just recently we were able to vote in primaries ( similar to usa i think ? ) . 
  barroso left our country in the middle of the downfall . 
  after that it was a long way down , until now . 
  guess who wants to be the next president of portugal ? 
  yes , barroso ... no confirmations , just rumours , and he would be up against guterres , another one that left the pm place in the middle of a crisis . 
  the recent growth of eu , followed by the crisis , was really miscalculated . 
  if we continued to grow like we used to , no problem . 
  romania , poland and etc would quickly develop . 
  but with the crisis , growth was not that good , adding to that many countries such as mine went up in flames . 
  we used to be immigrant receivers too , but now i bet a romanian would rather stay at home . 
  germany was an exception and received/receives loads of immigrants . 
  switzerland basically voted to close the borders ( to bad for them , good for me , wo n't get fat with their delicious chocolate ) , the nordic countries gained loads of population ( and they are having issues , i heard here that the immigrant population does not integrate , does not work , does nothing basically = / ) , and uk , with is own coin was less affected by the euro madness ( i am uber septic of my coin , a central bank with no political power is useless ) . 
  uk is in fact the place of choice of many of my friends . 
  again the emotional factor is always a problem when arguing this problem . 
  saying that i want border regulation and limits to immigration would be kind of saying i am shutting down doors for my future , and my friends future , and my so 's future . 
  but , and once again thank you for the detailed answer , seeing from your perspective , immigration with the current economy is probably causing social issues in your nation . 
  so this should be discussed between every country of eu to see what can be done . 
  how can we fix the jobless rates in the southern countries , and how can we help the eastern countries develop faster ( besides throwing money for roads ) . 
  i hope this new leadership in europe is able to guide us to a better future , we must put europe growing again . 
  and who knows when the time comes for me to go find a job outside this place i wo n't have to worry a lot about restrictions . 
  oh ... the magnificent ham . 
  essential for every sandwich . 
  must point out that the portuguese make clear distinctions between hams . 
  fiambre -  `` ham '' http://www.hipersuper.pt/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/fiambre.jpg . 
  thank you for the detailed text !, 
  actually really good explanation . 
  i got to say when i read here in / r/europe , the arguments against immigration within europe , i see it from my eyes / most of portuguese eyes . 
  our recent mass immigration is mostly composed by skilled workers . 
  young people , as me , that went through college , got education , worked a bit , but found themselves jobless ( no economy can grow without investment in new companies/ideas/science ... ) . 
  so many of us , and many of my friends went to sweden , germany , switzerland and to the uk . 
  literally 350.000 in the last 2 years according to some sources , non official says even more ... 
  when people here argue they do n't want immigrants , it really strikes me in the heart , it sounds `` i do n't want people like you , living here '' . 
  but , with your perspective i can see things a bit like they were once here , when the ukrainian and brazilian immigrants arrived in portugal . 
  unskilled jobs were being taken by them , but our economy was booming . 
  when we crashed to the ground , things got bad . 
  they had no homes , everyone started complaining about them , we had no money , we could n't afford paying them anything . 
  a disaster basically . 
  then our economy went really really really bad , and most of them just left . 
  we barely have new immigrants , just from old african colonies , and some that stayed here and found their place . 
  a `` wall '' that filters those who have a job and are skilled from the others could solve the problem indeed . 
  if the `` wall '' is needed to prevent uk from leaving eu for good , then ok , i would really be pissed if uk left , it makes no sense to me ( barroso is an ass ) . 
  but only temporary , someday this might get better , 
  that is very nice  although money would n't be the main driver , probably for me stability and the opportunity to develop would be the top priorities . 
  portugal is kinda lacking there ... 
  i shall do more research about ireland . 
  i do agree with you , our passport is also very good to get visas anywhere ( one of the most wanted also ) , but eu offers some nice things too . 
  i know probably you do n't feel that as much but for example i can go to spain with no passport . 
  spain is just one hour away . 
  i have no traffic at the border . 
  i have no one asking me anything . 
  i go to vigo , have lunch , buy something for dinner and head home . 
  i go to vigo , and i really do n't feel any difference . 
  i know people that work there , and live in portugal .

  i feel like the invaded nation should be colored differently . 
  green maybe . 
  what about sweden ? 
  third romae would disagree . 
  either way , just because rum claimed to be rome does n't mean they were . 
  same way charlemagne and the hre claimed to be the true successors of rome , but were they really ? 
  what about `` another lisbon '' ? 
  what does have to do with anything ? 
  i 've simply made the claim that if this is a civil war , then it 's strange for georgia to be portrayed as the aggressor . 
  the logic conclusion is that this is not a just a civil war but somehow you felt attacked about things that do n't concern you . 
  i 'm not arguing anything , i 'm simply stating that if it is not a simple civil war . 
  but if it is a civil war then the breakaway province was the one to start the war . 
  georgia would merely be restoring order . 
  hungary and macedonia are low effort . 
  some are quite distorted , such as portugal or greece . 
  the german one is just stupid . 
  the shape of the country should naturally remind me of something , instead of trying to find something that technically could fit in that shape . 
  i do n't disagree with you . 
  i 'm just pointing out that statement transmits no information . 
  it is useless to the overall argument . 
  the post is talking about occupied countries , yet you needed to invoke a different definition ( without stating you were doing it ) just to try to save face . 
  the fact is that the post is not about invasions of the territory that is presently controlled by a country , but about the occupation of the country in question , which differs considerately in several aspects , as it means an actual political take over ( even if temporary ) and not only holding a batch of territory ( like the battle of fishguard ) . 
  the uk never actually suffer such take over . 
  it might be different for england , but then so it is for scotland ( english invasions of scotland , for example ) . 
  following your definition , though , there is no indication in the map that it only concerns great britain and not ireland and the rest of the present uk territory , so i guess the safest date on the map , on your idea , would be 1982 with the invasion of the falklands . 
  in that case english invasions of scotland also should count as invasions of the territory of great britain . 
  either way , the title mentions occupied countries , so it does not make any sense for you to make a separate distinction for invasions in the uk presently controlled territory ( which would be wrong , because we would need to account for the falklands , too , for example ) . 
  only england was invaded not the whole of great britain , but if that 's how you want to play ... 
  the name is in english that did n't exist at the time . 
  there was no great britain either ... norman troops only invaded what is now england , not the independent kingdoms in scotland , wales and ireland . 
  if eu eggs are more expensive and if worse quality , like you claim , why would it be the problem of allowing them to be imported ? 
  surely the free market would make sure they would only fly of the shelves to a garbage container . 
  so either you are a terrible buyer or you do n't really mind eating garbage , considering all the bullshit that comes out of your mouth . 
  everything is stable until it is n't . 
  not this argument again ... 
  i do n't , that does n't make any sense . 
  eggs that are subject to more regulations , in this case to stop the spreading of salmonella , that is a big concern in europe , should be more expensive than those who are not regulated . 
  as an european , i prefer to pay for those eggs and not burden our national healthcare with preventable diseases . 
  my question is if the same philosophy applies with defenders of free market or that simply does n't matter to them . 
  it 's a valid ideology too , i guess , but then ours should be taken into account when discussion higher prices due to health safety regulations . 
  i thought it only concerned imports and not actual production . 
  thank you for the detailed explanation and i 'm sorry for wasting your time . 
  i was thinking the same . 
  oh , i thought ck2 was the younger game . 
  the more you know . 
  this is a doubt i have for quite some time , maybe you can answer me . 
  how is this problem solved when regarding free trade deals between the eu and other nations ? 
  does n't the same problem appears between japan and canada with eu as intermediary ? 
  or between eu and nafta with canada being the kingmaker ? 
  i think i am . 
  if not proud , at least i feel like a european citizen . 
  at least i feel more connected with my european partners , either through the eu , the type of tourists or students we communicate with or even just this forum . 
  does n't mean i discard my national identity , i love being portuguese , but i 'm european and i like it . 
  yes , britain has showing cracks for a long time . 
  / s anyway , i do n't see anything bad with what varadkar has said . 
  he stressed the eu position and give a possible solution ( maybe discussed inside the eu ) to solve one of the criteria needed to close the first phase of negotiations . 
  at this point what everyone is waiting is for the british to reassemble themselves and start negotiating . 
  first , we are talking about eggs , not the overall rate of salmonella and either way it does n't matter . 
  i just wanted to know what is your opinion and i gave mine . 
  do n't need to get all defensive . 
  bollocks , pigs do n't lay eggs . 
  the real question is why are you deathly afraid of cookie dough ? 
  do you prefer cheaper eggs that might spread diseases or better quality eggs that do n't ? 
  is it ethical to have deadly products in the market and expect the people to sort it out ? 
  either way , i think people in europe are happy with their healthcare , so i guess better quality eggs is not that a terrible thing . 
   us sucks eu rules if us was sucking eu rules , maybe their eggs would be of better quality . 
  congrats , it did n't take that long . 
  that 's not how the game is supposed to be played , as you skipped one blank space . 
  talk about being inept and incapable ... 
   given how much american culture they devour someone has to . 
  culture is our thing . 
  and then we make it better . 
  did you watch current american politics ? 
  i 'm not sure if our politicians are that more likely to contain bullshit than their american counterparts , but if they do , it is not due to eu regulations , but a proud tradition of screwing ourselves . 
  and on the american state . 
   50 times so american . 
  was i the only one making effort noises every time the poor chicken tried to push ? 
  and chickens . 
  spanish already sounds drunk enough , i do n't think portuguese excels that , but i might be biased . 
  well , suicide was considered a sin by the church . 
  logic ca n't really be appealed to when it enters the realm of faith . 
  what does neoliberal even mean in the european context ? 
  it 's just an insult imported from the us that does n't make sense in much of european countries . 
  you are killing a meme ... 
  i need to take of picture of this moment . 
  that 's answer not a question ... 
  no , i did n't try that yet . 
  what i 'm saying is that it would be unwise for op to give those informations regardless of having money or not at home . 
   also let me know when you 're away and where do you leave your spare key . 
  not that people 's houses usually have more things of value than money . 
  do you want a place to keep your money safe or a place to make more invest your money ? 
  i think it the ends it comes down to it . 
  if you want high interest rates there are places where you can invest it , but , of course , it will be riskier . 
  if you simply want to have your money in a safe place that seems a good plan . 
  maybe those are the two thirds that live far from the coast , like near zagreb . 
  but does it makes sense for religious groups to be receiving such benefits ? 
  do n't worry , they still are . 
  that makes no sense , porto is by far coolest than lisbon , but certainly the title should go to some city in scandinavia .

  ok ... that makes all the difference, 
  great euro crisis ? 
  ... euro meltdown ? 
  ... wtf ? 
  ... is this a joke ? 
  there should \u00b4 t exist a nobel prize in economics ... it isn \u00b4 t a exact science and errors following someone or a line of thinking can cause a lot of harm to people, 
  isis is in war with everyone ... even with itself, 
  don \u00b4 t mess with people \u00b4 s head !, 
  no one wins ... we all lose, 
  innocent people die, 
  the stupidity of all this is just horrendous ; this new greek government had no bargain power , had nothing 0 ; and still they tried to play the big game ; what of disgrace . 
  people want their way of life ... pensions , cars , holidays , job in the office , free welfare ... all the things that money can provide , and still they want to impose their conditions to the guys to lend them money ... what a stupidity, 
  greeks are very confident on this syriza government, 
  yes/no to austerity !, 
  ... that \u00b4 s a tough choice !, 
   but something tells me that might change when tsipras tells them the cost of staying in ok, 
   in a recent opinion poll , 7 out of 10 greeks want to keep the euro at all costs . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2015/06/19/greeks-in-last-ditch-rally-to-stay-in-the-eurozone/ ), 
  don \u00b4 t the polls say greeks want to stay in the euro ? 
  doesn \u00b4 t the polls say that more than 60 % of the greeks want to stay in the euro ? 
  ... referendum for what ? 
  to know the answer we already know ? 
  well it is ... what can you do against terrorism ? 
  good ... then the creditors will have something to sell at the auctions insolvent, 
  lol, 
  russia invades the next day, 
  it would \u00b4 t be my neighbour a long time ago . 
  why \u00b4 s that ? 
  i would build a bunker with dried food for a year, 
  we don \u00b4 t need anarchy . 
  no one does . 
  power to the people, 
   you 're assuming the imf truly really wants what is best for greece and is infallible no i \u00b4 m not . 
  imf doesn \u00b4 t give a shit for greece . 
  imf just wants to protect the money it invested in greece , by being paid back by the greek government ; that \u00b4 s their only interest ; the greek people should be a concern of the greek government ; don \u00b4 t mix the things because i assume that either you don \u00b4 t know what you say , or are intentional doing left wing stupid propaganda . 
  i think the government should take the measures to protect his citizens . 
  to change the laws to promote the private sector grow , fire public workers or privatize public assets ... you need imf approval ? 
  that \u00b4 s hitting the bottom ; besides if wise measures where taken to the imf by the greek government , i doubt they would oppose ... but if that \u00b4 s the case !!!, 
  ... prepare for civil war and country disintegration . 
  without a deal in the eurozone , greece it \u00b4 s history . 
  if now you \u00b4 re against a 5 % pensions cut , after a failed deal you will not have money for pensions ( worst scenario ) ... good luck to all greeks . 
  i think this is the end of greece as we know it . 
   it can not make decisions for itself man those propaganda sound bites ... who makes every day decisions on greece ? 
  who decides to hire of fire public workers ? 
  who decides to raise or lower taxes ? 
  like you said printing your own money makes politician \u00b4 s life more easy , but the ordinary man having to deal with hiper inflation is kind of disturbing ; imagine going for a drink in a coffee esplanade and having to pay the drink when the waiters delivers her ... because if you wait until you leave the esplanade , it will cost you more . 
  imagine with the hyper inflation trying to save some money to the future ? 
  ... the money you saved for a long time will be worthless and on ... 
  i think this is no solution . 
  if you trying to save yourself on the exports rise , with the money devaluation , no one guarantees you that you will have enough exports to run the country ... it \u00b4 s a bad management decision anyway i look at it . 
  i \u00b4 m not question all those results , from the failed imf policy 's ; what i question is the ability of a country to save himself , recovering from years and years of bad social and political bad decisions , hoping that an external entity solve the problems they been gathering all this time . 
  the imf can make bad decisions , basically it doesn \u00b4 t give a shit about the results of that ( ok , maybe some public acknowledge of bad policies ) but the ones who get fucked are the countries ; in that sense have you ever asked yourself , that maybe , just maybe , the imf and germany and ... is just the smallest of your problems ? 
  maybe you sick society is the first one to blame for this ?

  if you know where i can find studies on the costs of construction , please share . 
  construction prices are very , very , very inflated . 
  construction costs are very low when we talk about materials , what makes costs rise it \u00b4 s labour . 
  but basically prices from the house market stayed the same from pre 2008 bubble , with a lot less work contractors , that where used to earn a lot of money , run into troubles mostly by bad management .

   either merkel becomes the midwife of a new europe or she will find herself relegated by history as responsible for having killed forever a european dream . 
  this dream is bigger than any person agenda ; there can be bumps in the way but the train is already in motion also syriza lack of trust is also a result of out of reality extreme left ideas ... this is why i never saw syriza as a revolutionary movement capable of anything concrete other than isolate himself,

  a different currency is a barrier for trade , and the argument for having an own currency so that we can devalue to improve trade goes down the drain when that said devaluation has a negative impact on the whole economy ( as everyone 's net worth is negatively affected ) , when changing to a different currency would mean your exports would need to be converted to another currency within the eurozone ( our largest market ) and when you have a lot of products which you need to import no matter what ( so we 'd experience harsh inflation ) . 
  so you ca n't really blame our negative balance of trade on the euro , our largest market also has it and changing the currency away from it would have quite severe impacts to our exports - and you really do n't want to compete on the same level as the east asians . 
   since you 're someone who is against the minimum wage i 'm not , i 'm against our system of minimum wage . 
  i 'm for a minimum wage similar to that of italy , austria , germany , denmark , sweden and norway where is n't not an arbitrary value imposed to everyone equally . 
   you actually appear to be some kind of gold standard supporter which is what the euro pretty much is these days . 
  gold standard ? 
  do n't confuse me with those us libertarians who want to go back in time back to the days before central banks or with the austrians that think that currency should be privately issued . 
  what i 'm for is simply a stable european currency so that there 's less restrictions to trade and so that politicians ca n't get away with constantly devaluing the currency since it 's unpopular for them to increase taxes or cut spending . 
   you seem to only want to see the good things with the euro , when the bad things are now blatantly obvious and the willingness in europe to deal with monetary union problems , from either politicians or their electorates , is quite non existing . 
  which blatantly obvious bad things ? 
  the only one i can think of is that we can no longer devalue it at will , and i do n't really consider it a bad thing . 
   in fact many europeans seem to insist that there is no problem with the emu , the only problem for them are dumb and lazy southerners requiring some protestant education . 
  that stupid and you know it . 
  some retards call us dumb and lazy , other retards say those who refuse to give us more money are nazis , so yeah , there 's retards everywhere , ignore them , they 're not the problem , the problem was our constant public deficits and the delaying in paying them - unfortunately for us , we ca n't just keep delaying the payment of our obligations and expect that people continue to supply us the cheap money . 
   i would love for us to be in a fiscal union , i 'd love for us to have a functioning central bank like the us , i 'd love europeans to be glad to support one another , i 'd love world peace . 
  sadly none of these things appear to be happening any time soon . 
  yup , i agree with all of this . 
  however , just because these do n't seem they will happen any time soon , we should n't backtrack and scrap that which we 've already achieved . 
  trying to bring down the partial monetary union because there 's still no full monetary and fiscal union , i personally find that counter-productive . 
  til there are people incarcerated in portugal . 
  i was under the impression everybody walked free here . 
  portugal here , thank fuck for the euro , it has saved us from what happened in the past where all debts were paid by devaluing the currency ever further instead of addressing the issues . 
  it 's also much easier to export to the rest of europe , to import goods like fuel and to prevent interest rates of being even higher , so yeah , the $ uro could have been implemented better but it has been great for us so far . 
   siesta is a spanish thing , not portuguese . 
  i really ca n't blame the spanish for the siesta considering their days are huge , their timezone being the same as sweden and poland has these effects .

   strong military is good for maintaining western dominance of the world , which is absolutely an imperative for the ** previous centuries ** . 
  there , ftfy , the time of european military domination is dead and long gone , we wo n't control anyone else with the barrel of a gun when nuclear weapons are easily available . 
  we hardly have a military and we matter immensely , our economy is stronger than that of the usa , and i think this is a great thing , we work in our self-interest and also benefit others instead of alienating the rest of the world . 
  you can call me deluded but i think that we are much stronger if we can get others to help us because it would be in their interest as they 'd also benefit economically than we would be if we just threatened with violence like drone strikes and such . 
  so yeah , between investing in the military at the expense of the economy or letting the economy grow freely and cut spending in the military , i 'd rather that we just kept our military to the minimum and focused all our efforts in the economy . 
   i do n't favour argentina . 
  but the island is in south america , it would belong to either brazil or argentina .

  we must make choices , one ca n't just ask for the world , i 'd rather not tax people so high so that the economy benefited instead of taxing them and building a military base so that the military benefited . 
  besides , if you want to promote peace , an arms race is n't the way to go , the eu itself is proof that it 's much better to simply liberalise and free the markets so that the economies become interconnected and that a conflict is against the best interests of all parties involved - and there 's also the benefit that stronger economies benefits our societies while stronger armies are only good for killing those who oppose the powers that be . 
   to maintain global military dominance ? 
  that 's been proven to not be effective . 
  if anything , we should strive for global economic dominance , now that would be swell . 
   he 's an eu citizen . 
  this . 
  the thing about promoting equity through welfare is that it also leads to inefficiency , a basic income guarantee would be great if you wanted a system that promoted people living off the work of others - while i would n't think of moving to germany only to live on welfare , i 'm sure some people would and now is not really the time to place another burden on the economy , we have enough problems as is with our public sector debt . 
   it 's only insane if you do n't understand it . 
  it 's also insanely unaffordable and it also promotes unemployment which is insane . 
   it 's probably true that people on this subreddit share a great deal more with each other than with their compatriots . 
  we 're all losers , too . 
   a basic income guarantee great , give me that so that i can move to germany and live on welfare . 
  why do we need nato anyway ?

   it 's somewhat like calling all of britain or the uk `` england '' . 
  i 'm aware of that but it makes things simpler . 
  sure , on reddit i also write `` the netherlands '' or `` united kingdom '' but when i talk normally i say `` holland / holanda '' or `` england / inglaterra '' just because it 's much easier and because , unlike what happens in reddit , nobody gets upset or attempts to correct me . 
   whites are still master race for me .

  why not holland ?

   fuck you for even implying this thing is even remotely democratic or even remotely involves the citizens  fuck you lol, 
  you have good taste in music ,

  do you people really expect to be taken seriously when you throw around the word `` elites '' at the slightest thing ? 
  not good enough but doable . 
  i do agree with cameron 's proposals of cutting the eu budget and i 'd even go farther , cap and the strasbourg parliament need to go as they 're too expensive , though it 's quite obvious that france will veto anything of the sort , so the next best thing would be to make cap optional so that member-states could opt out and make france alone the one to pay for the strasbourg parliament ( again , this is much easier said than done but it would be beneficial on the long run for europe ) . 
  regardless of this , i do hope that britain wo n't alienate itself more from the eu , they ca n't continue to just opt out or veto , going in the reverse direction of the rest of europe , these issues must be well discussed and a democratic outcome reached , not the usual `` either do what we want or do whatever and leave us out of it '' the uk seems to be doing .

  finally all parties in parliament are taking up some responsibility in their shoulders . 
  even the animal party , while not being officially part of the deal , has been cooperating closely with the government and voting in favor quite often . 
  at the same time this situation of a minority party government ensures that the government is under much bigger scrutin than usual . 
  this is working , i hope it will keep on working for at least 3.5 more years , 
  a family of 6 syrians relocated in portugal from greece , under the eu program of relocation , abandoned the apartment provided to them in the town of mangualde and disappeared after only 2 weeks . 
  they had shown interest in moving to norway , however their current location is unknown . 
  portugal already received 357 refugees from the relocation program . 
  you can start offering your trip there , even if there 's no specific greek version yet . 
  of course it will be less likely to find passengers , but this website/brand is growing very fast ... 
   also , last time a kid vomited in my backseat . 
  three . 
  times . 
  her mom paid me a coffee though . 
  oh that 's nasty though , not sure the coffee paid off . . 
  i 'll think about a no-kids policy :p i had a rabbit once , counted as luggage though , yep , a live rabbit lol, 
  i think they have a system for female drivers to make their offer of trip available only for female users , but i think that 's how far as it goes . 
  for the rest you can evaluate people as you wish , but anyone will be able to see your trip . 
  your phone number is only available once they 've booked and you 've accepted their booking . 
  some drivers actually make the acceptance immediate and automatic , others like to check on who 's booking first . . 
  so if i would use the german version maybe i can avoid those fees ... hmm i will try that next time , 
  basically you can search on the website if someone is doing the trip you plan to do , let 's say luxembourg-paris ( plenty of offers here ) , or if you intend to drive you can announce it on the website . 
  the website determins a maximum amount that the driver can charge per passenger , the idea is that the driver does n't get a profit but only shares expenses -- this is not intended to be a long distance uber . 
  and that 's it , the passengers book the trip and pay it on the website , on the scheduled day they meet and go onboard , and once the trip is concluded the passenger gives a code to the driver or marks the trip as performed on the app . 
  both the driver and passenger give a review on each other , that only becomes public once both have done it . 
  co-passengers ca n't review each other though . 
  so when you look for a trip or when you accept a passenger you can see their previous reviews and decide accordingly . 
  the website uses things like phone number and facebook to attest your identity . 
  i already did a few trips with them and i always enjoyed it , it 's a nice way of meeting people and practising languages . 
  i think blablacar has some sort of insurance in case things go wrong , but as it 's not for profit the people going along count as friends for insurance purposes i guess ... 
  i recommend it . 
  just notice that when you look for a trip the price shown is without the fee yet , that will add up some euros , depending on the fare price . 
  for a 22 $ fare expect 4 $ something fee . 
  but in markets where they 're new the fees are lower or even non-existant . 
  but even if they do n't have an official website for a country , like the us ( [ interesting interview with the founder that touches the issue of why are they not in the us ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/blablacar-when-will-real-ridesharing-come-us-1944519 ) ) , it 's possible to publish trips there as well , it 's just less likely to find passengers/trips . 
  the fees are precisely to pay for the service of reputation and connecting the people ... they do it very nicely i have to say . 
  but fees should be lower . 
  frequently people negotiate the return directly with the driver to avoid paying for them ... 
  i love them . 
  but the fees are getting too high . . 
  the [ underwear guy ] ( http://darkroom-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/06/afp-getty_topshot-france-environment-weather-flood-2-760x488.jpg ) is being picked by more newspapers though . . 
  i recognize the dutch tourists by the colors they wear , specially men , with strong purples , greens or pinks . 
  much rarer in other nations . . spaniards are also easily recognizable by their clothes , either alternative-left ( long hair , beard . . ) or partido-popular style ( women with vests and riding boots ) . 
  then there 's the germans , with their jack wolfskin tourist gear and deuter bags , not to mention white socks and sandals , it 's almost an uniform , freaky .

   nobody considers the azores to be part of europe .

  plus the difference is smaller and smaller ... these days you do n't get a hot meal on european flights with most traditional airlines , with ryanair you actually can , for a fee sure , but the possibility is there . 
  legroom is bigger than many mid-sized aircraft used by traditional airlines . 
  pay for luggage is more and more common ... seriously , i do n't get the bitchin , i 'm a frequent flyer , of both low-cost and traditional airlines , and i hardly see any major difference these days for short-haul , less than 3 hour flights i only care about the price tag . 
  i like ryanair , made travelling accross europe crazy cheap . 
  wears the european colors , was the first real european airline , making full use of the open skies policy ... they have strict rules , with luggage and so on , if you respect them , you 're good to go . 
  it 's not like you get much more flying economy inside europe with most traditional airlines . 
  it was actually quite obvious , if you 're not completely ignorant about the social context of holland and the political one of the newspaper . 
  if it was a neo-nazi gang that mention would be in the title and repeated across the entire article . 
  as the teens were of moroccan origin it 's only stated that they were dutch , intentionally ignoring the background that can give clues about their motivations . 
  once again , the irony is that in morocco plenty of men hold hands in public ... 
  i 'm guessing the teens doing the attack have origins in countries where men usually hold hands in public without being perceived as gay ... 
  yeah , but that one row got quite aggressive at the time . . 
  could that also be related to that row between the uk-austria over eu subsidies to a nuclear plant in the uk ? 
  if people want to call brexit a punishment do so , but keeping clearly stated that it was 100 % self-imposed . 
  but they say each bill costs less than 10 cents to produce :p, 
  i think the graphic is missing one of the things they really want : the end of the eu . 
  more and more i have a clear impression that a big portion of brexiteers voted for the end of the eu and that 's why they go on so angry even after winning the referendum , as they realize that they 're not getting what they want , they 'll just get brexit . 
  i think they forgot eurovision ... 
   the second bomb was supposed to be five times more powerful than the first one . 
  it was filled with metal balls and coins to have more victims . 
  the number of attacks that almost happened during the last decade is really incredible . 
  they should send a free sample to every citizen so people get used to it .

   brazil had a king until the 20th century , right ? 
  no , it turned into a republic before portugal . 
  that 's why the brazilian flag is actually older than the portuguese one , a thing few people know and one more argument to favor it as the flag to illustrate the language ... 
  it 's cooler and more precise to say that it 's the only european country that had it 's capital in south america for a decade or so ... 
  that 's quite wrong actually , there were many colonizers before the portuguese , ex . 
  romans and arabs both colonized the iberian peninsula and in fact most of the portuguese colonization comes centuries after the explorations ... initially it was mostly a trade network , not active colonization of big portions of land and people . 
  so epic . 
  for people that have no patience to watch a full match that was pure gold , totally watchable . 
  how a language sounds to you always depends on your own language and your cultural references . 
  a language sounding good or bad is indeed incredibly relative . 
  vinho verde is indeed awesome , best summer wine in the world .

  as for the $ , the only thing the germans did to us wrong was loaning us money and ( apparently ) not caring if we invested it wisely or not . 
  sure , eu policies like the cap or the cfp could have been much better employed ( they did wreck our national farming , and to some degree , our fisheries , but that was because we joined at the wrong time , when everyone was downsizing their productions and we needed to increase it ) but what made the most damage was socialist policies like free computers ( the magalh\u00e3es ) for everyone in school , building football stadiums like there was no tomorrow for euro 2004 or increasing in the minimum salary and unemployment wages ( you have people that could work in industries like cork or textiles but that instead work as maids or waitresses because the government would n't allow them to receive the same amount of money if they worked in the industries ) . 
  not to mention that it 's easier to shut down a factory than to fire 5 or 6 unproductive workers , but that 's another story , about how unions can ruin your economy . 
  honestly , with the $ , the growth you do have is a much more real representation of reality than it was with the $ ( escudo ) , as before the government could just set the exchange or interest rate and adulterate the currency , now we 're forced to actually work in order to grow . 
  obviously our productivity was n't going to beat the german one , not with our culture and our non-interest , but that 's just how things are . 
  we have nobody to blame but ourselves . 
  germany is n't a white knight in shinning armor here to save us from ourselves , but they do work much more and harder than we do and our governments policies are ( or have been ) indeed above its capabilities . 
  and even though things have n't been easy and this adjustment is clearly not an easy one , the eu is still a great project - there just needs to be more accountability and responsibility . 
  i do n't want the uk to leave , i want them to take responsibility for joining in the first place . 
  it should n't be what the eu can do for the uk ( or any other country for that matter ) but rather what can the uk do for the eu . 
  we need to move past these small borders and think larger , it 's a community , we are not enemies of each other , we should be working together , not whining and threatening to leave if things are n't going as good as they should be . 
  honestly , i thing it would be best if just if we continued to work together and , in the future , if everyone else but the uk wanted to be involved in this , then the uk should just stay out and not join the `` eu successor '' , and in that case , make a referendum in every country before joining so that in future european projects , there are no more countries that seem to be fighting against integration rather than welcoming it . 
  the us constitution 2nd amendment ? 
  in r/europe ? 
  seriously ? 
  why are you giving him credibility ? 
  last time i checked , he is n't even european , so why even bother ? 
  while i see no harm in guns being used strictly only for sport , surely you agree that more regulation is sometimes required , right ? 
  i mean , it 's one thing to use allow some guns to be used for sport , it 's another to allow guns like ak-47s or hand grenades like those described in the news to be available to the public , right ? 
  while one can argue that all guns should be banned or not , a ban on these guns would n't really hurt you at all , right ? 
  why is a ban on guns a bad thing ? 
  and down again and up again and down again and up again * ad infinitum * welcome to the stock market . 
  dude , if you hate the eu so much , why do n't you leave ? 
  goodbye democracy ?

  thanks for the link . 
  the portuguese constitution is already incredibly similar to the german one . 
  when it was drafted in 1976 , the german one was its main support . 
  but what about the uk ? 
  why is that all the comments are related to us politics ? 
  sure , it 's an interesting subject , but this probably is n't the best place for those discussions , is it ? 
  i believe calling them out on their bullshit is enough . 
  memes do n't belong here . 
   it does n't matter it they ruining the economy in the process or destroy our gdp . 
  please , cut back on the leftie talk . 
  we are where we are because we spent too much , our economy and our gdp are wrecked because we were living above our capacities . 
  we need the imf , we need the eu and we need germany . 
  otherwise the state would go down just because it would run out of money , and without money , you would n't be able to do anything . 
  what we need is more liberalization of the economy - it 's insane that it 's easier to shut down a factory than it is to fire the half a dozen leeches who do n't work at all or that you have people who retired in their 50s receiving some 1000 $ or 1200 $ in pensions and hardly paying any taxes whereas you have an unemployment rate in people below 25 years of 28 % and those who do are employed receive on average 750 $ !, 
  we not only need the money , we need politicians strong enough to tell these leeches that this wo n't be possible because it 's just not economically viable !, 
  the entire welfare state is on the line , we need to cut back on it immediately or we 'd be in serious risk of losing it all !, 
   do n't mistake wall street for the us . 
  we do n't . 
  the so called `` 99 % '' is proof of that . 
  if the usa proves unable to regulate ws from there , we at least must act to minimize their damage here . 
  portuguese , not portugese . 
  as for the lazy part , well , it 's all because of the benefits . 
  if portuguese , italians and greeks are more protected from unemployment than there are germans , obviously the germans are going to work more while the former are going to slack off much more ( and still feel entitled to the same benefits ) . 
  as for the pigs , it 's excusable . 
  i mean , i really do n't care one way or the other , but if you get pissy for being called soviets ( or so i 've been told ) then you should also consider not calling us pigs . 
  it does n't really help us as a whole and things are already hard enough as it , let us at least try to be united while dealing with these issues , and if these acronyms might stand in the way , why not dropping their usage ? 
  i would n't mind being ruled by a german , a danish or a finnish . 
  actually , i 'd welcome it . 
  we seriously need people that are able to cut with all the waste ( like wild pensions for people who retired in their 50s , unemployment subsidies for those who do n't quite feel like working and social funds for those with no money to pay rent but with enough money for a lcd screen or a porsche ) without losing votes because all that scum decides to act like cry-babies when they feel they 're going to get of the government tits , and they all vote accordingly . 
  you know what ? 
  perhaps i 'm exaggerating a little , but the main idea is there . 
  this kind of shit does n't go down in your countries , why should it happen in mine ? 
  i 'd love to be part of a responsible society like yours , and between corrupted portuguese politicians or responsible danish politicians with funny english accents , i 'd take the later any day of the week . 
  funny how the danish actually do more than just talk shit about the team they 're in . 
  i disagree , other than the uk , it seems everyone wants the eu project to work . 
  while you might get flak for not wanting to pay for our government fuck-ups , do n't take it too seriously , that often comes from an angry minority who thinks they 're entitled to all the benefits with none of the responsibilities . 
  i remember during the finnish elections some anger from my fellow portuguese claiming they were being selfish and yada yada but when we from portugal continental had to pay for the fuck-ups of the madeira government , we were saying the exact thing the finnish were saying about us !, 
  just beware that not everyone is like that , the only opinions you hear are the ones from those that are the most displeased , trust me that most of us have some sense of pride in being part of this project and are fully committed in the prosperity of europe , and the fact that your countries ( germany , denmark , finland , sweden , etc ) are still trying to hold everything together is great . 
  no , we do n't hate you for it and yes , we do agree with your policies . 
  you do n't even have to do them because you 're selfish , you can do them to make us learn from our mistakes and so that you continue to be healthy enough economic wise to be able to continue to help us . 
  please do n't go down like we did , we admire you and now more than ever we need to work together for a brighter future . 
  federalism sounds much better than dismemberment , and even if the former turns out to be unachievable , you can still take some comfort in the fact that me and many more younger people would rather move there than being stuck here paying for our parents and politicians mistakes . 
  i 'm portuguese and i fully agree with what you said . 
  it would be best if everything was fully protected , but if a choice is required , first get your shit straight and then try to save the rest . 
  you do n't even need to feel guilty for doing so , i 'd for example gladly move there and find a job there where people are more serious and determined than here were half my salary goes to the state and the unions . 
  i 'm portuguese , and we felt the same when ps was in power . 
  now with psd , it 's like the laws come directly from germany - which i do n't think is bad at all , if you do n't mind me saying such . 
  portuguese here , m\u00e1rio soares is not to be taken seriously . 
  the guy had his time and it 's now over . 
  you should consider unsubscribing from those - they 're mind numbing and while fun at first , quickly turn incredibly stale and obnoxious . 
  that 's a valid question , but asking it with a meme just makes it impossible to be taken seriously . 
  uk students ? 
  hopefully it would n't be all red , like it would be with the uk elderly . 
  this could be good news for portugal 's economy , if our politicians knew how to take advantage . 
  since they do n't , it 's a shame - both the ban on netherlands and the money we as an union are not making . 
  then the uk can stay out of a future european federation and leave their euro skepticism to themselves . 
  i in fact wonder why they joined in the first place , if all they do is whine and oppose , their alternative being no further integration ( like before the world wars , everyone for themselves ) . 
   but a single government for all of europe , at a time when people are out on the streets demanding a greater influence in the decision making process , i just do not see that happening any year soon . 
  neither do i , but i hope it does , at least in the next 20 years or so . 
  the way things are , we much either choose federalism or dismemberment , and i much rather have the former . 
  a fully integrated union like we ( or at least i ) dream of will still take a lot of time and further integration to achieve , and we have bigger problems to face at the moment , but once this whole banking and financial crisis is taken care of , and the way is cleared for a even more unified europe , that should be one of our primary goals . 
  what you said about minnesota or florida could be said about portugal and spain . 
  if you compare texas with illinois or nevada with maine you 'll see that they 're also incredibly different . 
  just because they 're that different does n't mean they ca n't have the same goals and work as a team , and so should we . 
  the language barrier is , on its own , a great barrier against an use . 
  but that does n't mean that , if it were to happen , france and germany would rule it . 
  these could be broke in terms of states ( like belgium - 1 vote , french lorraine & alsace - 1 vote , german bavaria - 1 vote ) or the rest of eu nowadays grouped so these could have a stronger voice in eu ( like germany - 1 vote , portugal & spain - 1 vote , austria & hungary - 1 vote ) . 
  as for the uk and scandinavia , it 's not like anything would be imposed on them , they 'd join later like they did initially and will do with the euro ( when it ever gets back on its feet ) . 
  overall , it would be great , an europe unified ( like the usa ) , with a single government and with a single voice . 
  how crazy would it be for example if florida or mississippi wanted a single american currency and the creation of us bonds but california disagreed with it and new york did n't even agreed with the creation of the us dollar ? 
  this is how the eu is currently , and while we 're much more unified than we were in the past , it 's hardly an union if we still disagree so much and are trying to impose national agendas on an european project . 
  as for the global federal government , yeah , i agree , it wo n't work , at least not in our lifetime , if things continue like this . 
  we do n't even need it , we just need peace , understanding and prosperity , that does n't require a one world government , that just requires we not being assholes with each other . 
  we should for now focus on stuff like the middle east or the dictatorship regimes and only then worry ourselves with those dreams .

  his second voyage was much more * fun *  during his second voyage to calicut , da gama intercepted a ship of muslim pilgrims , travelling from calicut to mecca .

  they offered their wealth , which `` could ransom all the christian slaves in the kingdom of fez and much more '' but were not spared . 
  da gama looked on through the porthole and saw the women bringing up their gold and jewels and holding up their babies to beg for mercy .

  the flag of lisbon is related with saint vicente of saragossa , the saint died in 4th century in valencia after being severely tortured and his body was thrown in the coast of portugal on what is now the cape of saint vicente , and according to the legend his body was protected by ravens who prevented other wild animals of eating him . 
  later in the 12th century , afonso i of portugal exhumed the saint to lisbon , and while on the voyage , made by boat , some ravens were accompanying it . 
  that became a symbol to the newly formed christian kingdom and so adopted by its capital .

  as for leaving the country , i 'm portuguese , here people do n't mind leaving , it 's something normal to happen since ever at least in the `` interior '' , for most parts portugal is a desert of human life and within a few more decades all that his going to left were some cities ij the coast populated by a spectrum of multicultural people , nothing wrong about that bit , but sometimes it saddens me to think that people would rather live in like a fish in an aquarium just because they have someone giving them food than be free to swim in the ocean despite all the dangers . 
  there once was guy that lived in a small house , nearby there was a huge palace where they would eat good shrimp , caviar , etc. . . and the man though `` my life is miserable , i ca n't live no more '' and so he decided to suicide and jump of a bridge , but as he walked into the bridge he so a homeless man , shirtless sleeping on a bench , and right next to him a whole family in similar conditions and so he looked back and smiled at his `` palace '' .

  santiago order was pretty popular in portugal too , and since spain had n't sub-saharan colonies at this time ( guinea equatorial is from xviii century ) i would say that the knight is probably portuguese .

  this is / r/europe ... in european terms uk has a lots of immigrants , do n't you agree ? 
  we ca n't really compare with any american country ... 
  and neither is the us for that matter ... but when we think of the usa we think of new york , los angeles and cities like that , if we go to utah or south dakota while many people can have some * distant * relative from germany they 're not immigrants . 
  same happens in uk , of course rural areas were n't made of immigrants , but what about london and other cities ? 
  and london surely is influential in the panorama of uk . 
  but you 're saying that like it 's a bad ... maybe i 'm just interpreting your comment the wrong way , but the british empire ... the roman empire , if there was a thing that made them the * greatest * of their times was their way of interacting with foreigners , with the peoples they had conquest , they way the knew how to adapt ...

  [ intro video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ddhaxqlgc ), 
  the big difference are the main expertizes of which country and that influences the productivity and what they produce the much , so while germans work less hours they 're working with metallurgy making cars , pieces for tanks , aeroplanes and computers , etc. . . while the portuguese and greece are working in factories producing textiles and making olive oil , in the end the wealth of a country ends being up fairly superior to the other . 
  and that 's why it 's important to have the european union , portugal and greece will never achieve the same wealth as germany simply because which country as its focus and in an union it 's better to have which one doing it 's expertise , just like in a football team , german is the goalkeeper saving eu from losing , portugal is the one making the outfits for the players and greece is the chef doing the meals for them , but in the end all the players , all the staff and all the people around were important to a well functioned eu, 
  a movie about a young man named alex that always arrives late to his meetings . 
  i 'm here just to say this :  hmm yeah , either kicked ass or then our poor infertile land with a few piss poor hunters just was n't worth visiting . 
  iceland , south korea , malawi , portugal and japan , here is a group of countries we do n't usually see put together, 
   portugal portugal is a founding member of nato , basically because while they 're neutral during ww2 they ceded an airbase in azores to the allies ( which is still today an [ american airbase ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lajes_field ) ) spain only joined in 1982 when they 're already a democracy . 
  the 4 +1 * bestest * countries !,

  just let the experienced people screw the country . 
  when you come to age , it will be your turn . 
  i understand , but considering portugal is a schengen country , it would be advisable to carry your id , instead of the passport . 
  but you should n't have any problems either way . 
  first , voting blank is a vote like any other . 
  i do n't count it as giving it up . 
  i never used it , but if there 's a time i believe none of the options satisfy me , that 's the way i would go . 
  second , everyone can vote already . 
  if you choose not to express your opinion , then i do n't believe the state has any right to take it from you . 
  it probably does , as they would only want to know your age , but do n't you have your official id with you anyway ? 
  that , unlike most countries , the people actually trust the government and the government trusts the people . 
  interesting argument . 
  i 'm probably talking big because there 's no actual mandatory voting here . 
  i would probably ended up voting regardless , but i certainly do n't like the idea of having it in place . 
  yeah , i feel the same way . 
  the parties campaign on their own interests and claim victory or defeat accordingly . 
  they basically treat those elections as indicators for the national ones . 
  that 's one of the reasons turnout is so low . 
  yeah , that was what i meant . 
  there 's an healthy relationship between the populace and the government , which is quite unusual . 
  i vote , but i do n't want to be forced to do it . 
  that was n't what i meant ... 
   and the government recommended voting yes i love how the swiss usually take the government advise into consideration . 
  can you imagine how awkward for everyone that scenario would be ? 
  for the conservatives for loosing so much ground , for the labour , hoping to get rid of corbyn with actually reaching ok results ... ? 
  ah , that 's a different thing !, 
  i though you were saying the voting age would range from 18 to 70 . 
  i think , but i 'm not sure , belgium let 's those who 've come recently to age to skip the first election or something along those line . 
  i understand the point you are trying to make , but the way you phrase it seems you are actually the problem , not the eu . 
  i would vote blank every time , if voting was made mandatory . 
  besides , why strip the voice from people above 70 or to forcefully increase the voting age to 18 when some countries allow it at 16 ? 
  i most likely would/will vote for a different party in eu elections and in national elections . 
  besides , not all of the parties at eu-level are represented at a national level . 
  for example , i do n't expect anyone to vote for the [ pdr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_republican_party_ ( portugal ) just because they are in alde , although several people might actually identify themselves more with alde than s&d . 
  i agree the eu needs a clean up and maybe a restructuration to make it more transparent , but sweden also as a lot of unelected bureaucrats ( without even mentioning that you have a non-elected head of state ) . 
  that particular criticism of the eu also applies to your own country . 
  wow , did you feel insulted ? 
  what a petty human you are . 
  do you know that no one is forcing you to go to kiev ? 
  you can stay in your own country and enjoy your own terrorist attacks . 
  and before you tell me that germany is still a pretty safe country , to which i agree , so it 's kiev . 
  not everyone wants to spend their holidays in the beach . 
  `` i 'm going to visit this city because it has the best transportation . 
  look at these buses . 
  please , admire how they do n't catch fire and how the vehicle actually stops when you press the brakes . '', 
  ps : my standards for what constitutes a good transportation network are pretty low . 
  * corrects it to estremadura *, 
  in algarve , the british are often called `` bifes '' ( steak ) , because of their sunburns . 
  it 's not a very nice name , but i though i should share it . 
  what was the greek motivation to enter such a conference ? 
  i 'm pretty sure it affects , but i 'm under the impression that norway is in quite a good spot regarding the eu . 
  no union , seems it would actually negatively impact norway . 
  certainly , but you can fairly accuse me of being bias , most of the countries would be left in a terrible shape if the eu was to be disbanded and it would be disastrous for portugal . 
  well , i consider myself a federalist , so i consider the kind of federation the eu would be an interesting subject . 
  i would like to know what is your motivation for opposing a union which , i assume based on your flair , you are not part of . 
  ps : unless you are actually from [ southway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southway ) , in which case , i understand some of the motives . 
  why do you care ? 
  first i would like to point out that nondemocratic government does n't necessarily means the country is not relatively free , but it does lack an important component that is to choose those you rule you . 
  one of the advantages of nondemocracy over democracy is its stability . 
  you may be able to start grand projects without having to worry about elections every four years . 
  it 's easier to plan your economy or social measures 20 years in advance and consolidate them , instead of the ping pong of a democratic system that oscillates between parties . 
  in a lot of countries where two parties dominate , this is a really sad reality that jeopardizes the concept of democracy . 
  that being said , it certainly does n't mean i do n't prefer to live in democratic society . 
  i certainly do , but democracy as we have it is far from perfect and other types of systems have some advantages ( not enough to justify them , in my opinion ) . 
  now imagine how awkward is to guard it against future invasions . 
  wow , huge wall of text . 
  thank you very much for your insight and sorry for making you waste that time . 
  it was quite enjoyable to read . 
  in spain is not seat or in japan not toyota ? 
  that 's surprising . 
  also , i do n't think jaguar in belize means what you think it means . 
  step one to leave the crisis : buy a bmw . 
  i do n't know about any more steps , but you cares ? 
  now you have a bmw . 
   the unemployment rate was 9 % at 2009 . 
  now , after austerity measures , its 27 % . 
  i 'm not sure , but was n't the public sector one of the biggest in greece ? 
  it certainly does n't cover the entire rise in employment , but did n't the draconian austerity meant a lot of that employment was due to a shrinking public sector ? 
  this is a serious question , i 'm really not sure what is or was the actual situation in greece . 
  edit : i said it was a serious question , not sarcasm or any of that . 
  who the hell downvotes a serious question ? 
  i do n't know if we should bring the us into this , considering puerto rico or the disastrous situations in cities like detroit . 
  i do n't know what to say about that ... 
  this is probably more suited to r/eurovision , i would say . 
  in wikipedia it says sbs plans to transform the selection process if continue to be invited by ebu . 
  maybe we will see that change in the future . 
  greece and cyprus 12 points were way more ridiculous than australia 's . 
  for me uk was one of the top 10 , so not surprising they would get 12 points from someone . 
  regarding the guy , one guy does n't make australia , but he was [ later identified as the prankster vitalii sediuk ] ( http://www.9news.com.au/entertainment/2017/05/14/08/02/australia-has-mooning-moment-at-eurovision ) , so he is not even australian . 
  you were closer to win that we ever were . 
  we ended last 53 years ago and before today our best score was a 6th place . 
  i 'm pretty sure australia wo n't need to wait that long . 
  it was , although she underperformed a bit , i believe she should be in top 10 . 
  :( although i would argue that the meme is not that subtle anyway . 
  except australia , maybe . 
  give 12 points to the uk . 
  and put it on a bus . 
  he called her for the finale . 
  the king in southwest !, 
  i 'm really confused .

  its 2015 if you want a strong wall you need something better than brics . 
  you can add the 25 % already living under poberty in portugal . 
  our poberty levels since 2009 went back to 80 's . 
  you dont get how tolerance works , you give some and then you recive some back . 
  those militaria stores in poland are selling real guns ? 
  does the czech state has an official religion ? 
   this is so true , every opinion poll done in europe shows that almost all european countries feel like they do , where you got that from ? 
  well i think a massive dose of austerity concentrated in 4 years should fix it . 
  how times change , ukip is now considered a mild party . 
   poverty and homelessness are extremely high . 
  oh japan is pretty rich , what you mencioned is the result of the conservative government . 
  we need to stick together half of europe is really crazy . 
  a gay refuguee would face threats in many of our member states . 
  what pegida radicalised ? 
  no way . 
  no money was given to us . 
  very heroic stuff no doubt . 
  since when `` leftists '' oppose nato ? 
  it was a douch move to say the least , but it did cause the end of our last king and it was not the reason we lost the overseas territories . 
  for portugal it worked well until we joined the euro . 
  good post . 
  i speak portuguese and english fluently , spanish at b1/b2 level . 
  hei maybe you dont know , but you can find left from pro europe open market to against nato , eu isolationists , furthermore global trade agreements are mostly pushed by right wing . 
  i met a few mostly turkish woman though . 
  competency is irrelevant as long as he is german . 
  i allways saw then as center right and socialist parties as center left . 
  i think most people dont realize that fact , and as consequence they dont appreciate what we have in europe, 
  all countries pick and choose what parts of their religion they wish to follow . 
  bit hypocritic but then again we are speaking of religion . 
  such an ignorant comment , reminds me of '' look the refugees have smartphones indignation '' . 
  law is not suppose to care about election dates . 
  you cant swap a damage bill in your central bank . 
  love this guy . 
  well i get your point , but there is a reason why the reader automatically assumes the paper was shut down by the government with this title ... 
  same title for other country this would not be implied . 
  hope they get caught . 
  agree . 
  this . 
  time for eu to regulate this shit asap . 
  its same thing in portugal , you want a coffee you drink an espresso . 
  no giant water down coffee for us . 
  stop making up lies , not everyone on europe restricts there decision 's to the quota deal . 
  pretty good . 
  not as bias as pt like to think . 
  go read the conclusions of the investigation , accusing a hand full of people ody rape , including some german nationals can hardly be defined as the rape of cologne . 
  hun no , only if you mean helping then will in turn hurt us . 
  witch is a point made by people that look at then as a mob that shares a set of negative characteristics instead of realising they are all individual 's that will act in different ways . 
  the probability of one individual being a terrorist does not justify denying help to everyone else . 
  how weak is your culture that can not stand a less then 1 % population variation . 
  countries that were previously against the quotas are still against them . 
  great piece of news no doubt . 
  interesting perspectives . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  my guess would be france . 
  some services are not meant to be profit blue or they are key tools in macroeconomic policies and should be state owned . 
  also selling public assets for a price bellow their value when the income it represents wont even make a dent on annual interests and debt management cost is a bad idea . 
  that is the mainly thing orban wants to see on headlines . 
  your are delusional , they will find the help that the italian state provides to their citizens based on their income level and accumulated health . 
  well ecb policy is definitely helping portugal . 
  media is making to much of a fuss about german politician 's complaints , they are not likely to change anything and likely they are just noise targeted at voters witch savings became less profitable . 
  eu has 500m citizens , in 2013 syria had 23m citizens , it gives 4.6 % . 
  yes different nationalities are arriving but i doubt many of them will be allowed to stay . 
  oh pls we could take in the entire syrian population and they would represent arround 4 % of the population, 
  wow , its like that cover was made to trigger this sub . 
  try an spd and green coalition , when was the last time spd actually behaved as a left wing party . 
  yes to all 3 of them , they were based in some truth , when you open your doors to millions of people some will commite crime but you can not convict people for crimes before they make them . 
   they still try to ban the product/project . 
  turns out that the product/project they 're banning is done by or used exclusively by a `` foreign company , and banning it is done to favour domestic companies , sometimes even companies the political party receives a lot of donations from '' ye this is not how it goes , first because such measures are forbidden by eu competition law and companies can appeal to eu courts , second because in most eu countries companies can not subsidy political parties ... oh and you can stop with that `` evil companies '' shit , companies have no moral grounds and this is precisely why they should be kept in a short leash . 
  this is the reason most people are against this deal , being against ceta does not make you a corporations hater . 
   they bring crime and unemployment , homophobia and misogyny . 
  lol this is pretty much what was told before eu expanded east . 
  x d, 
  those it really matter ? 
  the elections could have been 100 % legitimate and the opposition still would not have won or made any significant progress , after a decade of state run media while simultaneously demonizing any source of information that is not heavily controlled by the government , a decade of political intimidation including assassinations . 
  christ why all the world powers need to be so fuck up . 
  i liked their ukrainian war video coverage . 
  how so ? 
  \u017durek indeed is the best . 
  maybe go check what syria and libya looked like before the bush administration and then speak . 
  secular countries dont look at religion when deciding who to help . 
  why spd ? 
  serra da estrela : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estrela_mountain_dog this one will fight off an wolf . 
  oh i recommend going to a crisis great depression style , that will fix it , even if does not it may give the population a better perceptive on what are the important issues to focus on . 
  talking about north africans ? 
  we had our fair share in early 2000s did n't see us making a fuss about it . 
  i can tell you in this south corner we are feeling pretty safe . 
  because institutional investors make their decisions based on a few organizations reports . 
  he just means no bank or debt union . 
  what other eu integration is being discussed besides this ? 
  if you think russia is a safer country to live then germany you are delusional . 
  you have the cristian democrats if you do n't mind their conservative attitude . 
  people that complain eu is neither democratic or transparent , and every time they come across with it they down vote it . 
  your population is quite smaller then the countries you mentioned , why the hell would you guys get more voting power ? 
  how much more does the opinion of a rich eu citizen is worth in comparison to a poor eu citizen ? 
  sure you are happy its not your country watering down democratic institutions , you just happen to agree with their migrant policies and close an eye to everything else . 
  i shared it mostly because of his final statement , he is kinda of right eu would most likely force hungary to rollback some reforms orban did since he is in power and condemn some of his statement 's much more harshly then now . 
  haha thanks for sharing never saw it . 
  this will get so downvoted . 
  maybe if more redditors add more ads like this on their tvs they would be better people . 
  `` summer is over .

there is n't a lot of anti-immigrant sentiment here at all well , considering half the youngest generation likely are gon na be immigrants themselves it 'd make us all sort of hypocrites to dislike them . 
  glad to see you 're enjoying portugal and that you can have a good life around here , some of us have to move on to other european countries eventually . 
  i mean , i guess you guys are better than france or germany so ... that 's something ? 
  spain ... 
  do n't tell them though . 
  it 's a southern thing as far as i know . 
  because spain is also a regional definition much like italy . 
  italy did n't exist until the late 1800s but the region was still referred to as italy . 
  you know , if italy was to be split into lombardia and napoli for some reason , people would still call the region italy . 
  much like our peninsula has been referred to as spain for a long time , it 's derived from the roman ` hispania ' . 
  which is why when people say ` the spanish kingdoms ' they refer to castile , portugal and aragon . 
  because they 're kingdoms ... in spain . 
  which is precisely why the king of le\u00f3n named himself 'em peror of all spain ' at some point . 
  you know ... because spain also describes a region . 
  of which portugal is part . 
  iberia is the greek name for the roman hispania for the moor al-andalus . 
  spain is a perfectly valid term for the peninsula . 
  the kingdom of spain ( el reino de espa\u00f1a ) is referring to being a kingdom of the geographical region . 
  not unlike the rebublic of portugal is referring to being the republic of the geographical region of portugal . 
  to end , portugal is a region which is a subset of the larger region that is spain which also includes catalonia , galicia , andalucia and castilla . 
  it is , spain is both a region and a nation state . 
  portugal is part of the former but not the latter . 
  how is this hard to comprehend ? 
  what are you on about mate ? 
  portugal is not a part of the spanish nation state . 
  but portugal is most definitely part of the spanish region . 
  if you were to look at the peninsula in ~ 1450 then you 'd see spain broken up into portugal , castile , aragon , navarre and granada . 
  i hate my own countryman 's aversion to even being mildly be associated with the spanish . 
  these two nation states have a lot of shared history and we 're likely more similar than any other pairing you could make anywhere else in europe . 
  portugal is not a part of spain when you define spain as the spanish nation state . 
  portugal is a part of spain when you define spain as the spanish region . 
  spain is the spanish nation state in the spanish region whereas portugal is the portuguese nation state in the spanish region . 
  i 'm on board with this portugalicia thing . 
  oh fair enough , i generally picture prussia as going from konigsberg to holstein more or less . 
  i thought the hohenzollern dynasty was prussian , why is their castle in baden ? 
  oh wow , ca n't take a joke mate ? 
  that 's kinda funny coming from an american actually . 
  when is alaska being given to canada ? 
  i still find it weird considering canh\u00f5es ( cannons ) used to be bret\u00f5es ( bretons / englishmen ) . 
  why would you hear about spain instead of their more dashing far more relevant neighbour ? 
  ^ ^ ^ france, 
  is there a single nation in the eu that has applied for more than a single language ? 
  if not i mean , spain applied for the one with the most speakers clearly . 
   particularly portugal and greece that have been cosying up to russia in recent times . 
  we have ? 
  sure but it depends if their concerns are relative to something eu related or not . 
  catalan independence is not something that the eu should preside over , that 's for catalonia and spain to sort out . 
  if the secession happens and catalonia wants to have a deal with the eu like any of the other member states then the eu will no doubt get involved but until that point , catalonian and spanish politics are between catalonia and spain . 
  the government and other associations . 
  circumcision is by and large not an anti-religion thing , it 's an infant rights protection thing . 
  in general , what matters here is that governments are looking to protect infants from their families while they do not have the cognitive power to make a decision that just affects themselves . 
  i 'm fairly sure no one is arguing against voluntary circumcisions for adults but kids ca n't consent to cosmetic surgery and as such should be protected by law from being put through them . 
   i did n't feel it oh you felt it , you just do n't remember it . 
  he 's not wrong . 
  catalonian secession is a matter for catalonia and spain , not something the eu has to make decisions over . 
  if they split and catalonia wants to join the eu post-secession then the eu has decisions to make but not before then . 
  how so ? 
  most of our language is very similar to spanish spelling and sounds . 
  i have nothing against it personally . 
  our politicians ca n't really get any worse . 
  i thought everyone hated skane . 
  clearly prussians . 
  kicked them out 700 years ago . 
  i 'm always perplexed by this opinion . 
  how is a german having control over your country any worse than an englishman ? 
  i am seriously not attached to the idea that i must have portuguese politicians making decisions over my country , i just want competent politicians no matter the nationality . 
   if it makes you happier , people from galicia understands portuguese perfectly to be fair , galego pretty much is portugese . 
  i do like galicia though , it 's like a spanish northern portugal . 
  they would n't but most portuguese people can understand spanish whereas the inverse is rarely true ( and no , portuguese do n't learn spanish either ) . 
  if they find it so difficult to understand portuguese i do n't know how they 're supposed to understand a language that 's so dissimilar to theirs . 
  i 'm surprised the number is that high . 
  they ca n't even understand portuguese let alone english . 
  italy and poland would probably be the best bets for a majority supporting a federation as far as i 'm aware . 
  caldo verde helps , i could eat that soup every goddamn day . 
  no more than us really over here in portugal really . 
  there 's a lot of parallels to it . 
  portugal / spain is another one but that was sorted over 300 years ago . 
   scottish universities charge one set of fees for scottish students and eu students , and another set of fees for non-scottish uk students . 
  as far as i 'm aware , it 's mostly due to the fact that english universities do not provide the same benefits to eu and scottish students . 
   steal africans from their lands and make them work as slaves the vast majority of african slaves involved in the atlantic slave trade were enslaved and sold off to europeans by other africans . 
  would you say galician will be fine ? 
   i think nationalism is on the rise . 
  not sure that 's the case in the younger generations . 
  from what i 've experienced it 's the older generation ( in their 50/60s ) that is becoming increasingly anti-eu as a reaction towards the recent financial crisis . 
  the younger generations ( 20s / early 30s ) seem to me to be much more affable towards the eu . 
  so when the older generations start dying out , it 'll be the pro-eu generation that has the majority opinion . 
   it is common to have dinner at 21:00 , or even later during the summer . 
  same here in portugal . 
  also true in spain . 
  apparently i should be in austria . 
  followed by spain and france . 
  that sounds about right except for the spain part of it . 
  there are a lot of ukrainian immigrants here in portugal . 
  they integrate fairly well , speak with a funny accent and get along just fine with everyone . 
  mate , people are free to not want a relationship with someone for whatever reason they want . 
  too tall ? 
  loves shellfish ? 
  does n't mean they think those people are n't worthy of love or that they 're inferior . 
  they perceive an incompatibility between themselves and the person that has those attributes and therefor think they 'd rather not date them . 
  get it in to your head , not wanting to date someone is n't the same as thinking they 're bad .

  i would say that they steal individuality . 
  people should able to dress in a way they feel most comfortable with and should be able to express themselves in however they see fit . 
  well ironically i did my undergrad and master 's in portugal . 
  paid less than a 1000 euros/year for undergrad ( took one extra year than i should but that did not increase tuition ) and did not pay for my master 's because the tuition was wavered . 
  now i 'm getting paid to do a phd in england , so i guess that worked out well for me too . 
  the point is that more expensive education does n't mean a better one . 
  everyone should have the same opportunities regardless of their social background , it 's not always about the economy , sometimes it 's about social equality . 
  you talk about supply/demand but there are plenty of countries that offer free/cheap high education and then these qualified people are often hired in countries with expensive education . 
  would n't the demand in the job market incentivate the governments to decrease tuition in order to educate more people in professions the country requires ? 
  education should be getting cheaper ( free idealy ) , not more expensive , this is just sad . 
  i would not do a undegraduate degree in the uk ( or us ) paying this kind of fees . 
  darwin and newton would be on the greatest of the world ; they shaped the way we see the world, 
  it 's just not very reassuring that a defence strategy is not actually a defence strategy but a retaliation one . 
  as a citizen i do n't really care with `` hey you and everyone you knew die but a least we get them too am i right ? '' . 
  also i am not entirely convinced a sane country would bomb the shit out of another just for retaliation , killing more innocent lives and actually not getting anywhere with it . 
  ca n't we just not have nukes ? 
  so many trillions used on this just in case a insane leader decides to do something stupid . 
  it 's the most drastic measure against insanity ever . 
  oh sure , if they can detect it in time they could surely fire their own . 
  but this is why i do n't understand the fear of nuclear attack , any country that would initiate it they would also be destroyed , there would ' t be anything to gain . 
  now if they were really interested in defence they would invest on actual defensive methods . 
  a bomb is not a weapon for defence it 's a weapon for attack . 
  all this nuclear deterrent talk is bit disturbing because like you say it would only cause mutual destruction . 
  depends on the destruction they cause , if they target cities with governmental or military facilities that would hinder the other side a lot . 
  the radiation radius would be few kilometres and within a few weeks the ones that did n't die from the explosions would die from radiation sickness . 
  even if the country was able to respond somehow , an attack of a couple hundred nukes would render many locations inhabitable and the stability of the country would probably be compromised . 
  hypothetically , in a nuclear war situation , the winning side would likely be the one to strike first . 
  let 's face it , russia would be the largest threat ( unless the usa decides to go nuts ) , and with the thousands of warheads they have , with an infrastructure ready to lunch several at the same time they would take down most opposition . 
  that 's my point , there are other pressing matters at hand that need to be solved . 
  this seems to me an attempt to take advantage of the political instability . 
  i would say that the deterrent of the 1700 something warhead the usa has is much larger than the 150 deterrent the uk has . 
  even france has almost double the uk . 
  i do n't think war would break out just because the uk would go a couple of years with an oldish submarine ( which as far i understand still works ) . 
  also i read that technology will probably advance to the point of making a new submarine obsolete much sooner than the lifetime end of the submarine . 
  i stand corrected but is it worth renewing them ? 
  is it worth renewing them now or in the near future instead of leaving this decision for the near future ? 
  oh sorry , i kept forgetting this argument . 
  if you already have hundreds of nuclear bombs why do you need more ? 
  one single nuclear bomb attack would trigger ww3 . 
  hundreds from each side ? 
  that would be the end of civilisation as we know it . 
  i do n't think we would . 
  a portugal and spain union would only be usefull if both countries separated from the eu . 
  both being member the union would have no real benefit, 
  i do n't think this would fly well with most portuguese . 
  cooperation ? 
  yeah sure . 
  political union as in , there would some kind of iberian parliament ? 
  not likely . 
   so it begins now it ends, 
  i stand corrected on the canada comment . 
  but like you said single market is much more than that . 
  i have n't read it anywhere else , i just think that `` access '' can mean many things . 
  for example the common external tariffs , it could mean that the uk wants to have the same tariffs that the eu negotiated with other countries . 
  also in the case of canada , the eu is a very small market for it but it still imports about 35 % more than it exports so i 'm sure it was in their interest to follow the same regulations to be able to sell better ( ironically the largest export partner in europe is the uk , while the largest import is germany ), 
  i very much like the idea of the eurozone , and while it has problems i do n't think it 's an idea that should be abandoned . 
  more than that , i think an acceptance of cultures and an open world where one has more choices to choose it 's path is not an idea that should be abandoned, 
  it depends on what he says with access . 
  with a fta no one will stop the uk from buying with eu and vice-versa . 
  the single market rests on 4 pillars : 1 . 
  free movement of goods , persons , services and capital between member states 2 . 
  the approximation of relevant laws , regulations and administrative provisions between member states 3 . 
  eu-wide competition policy , administered by the commission 4 . 
  a system of common external tariffs ( cet - also known as the common customs tariff ) in the case of fta is free movement of goods ( someone correct me if i 'm wrong ) , it does n't mean you get all the others . 
  living in the uk it really saddens me that the comments in this subreddit , and apparently from british politicians , are that one side has all the leverage and that they just want the other side to collapse . 
  canada-eu is a free trade agreement ( or area ) , it 's not single market . 
  they have access to the single market in the sense they can sell to it , but they are not part of it as a whole . 
  you do realise that even the leave campaign has been claiming they could maintain access to the single market ? 
  the uk also wants the single market . 
  the single market is the best option for everyone . 
  what is not the best option in undermining one of the core principles of the eu, 
  this is the best comment i have seen about brexit, 
  one can keep dreaming, 
  you do realize these agricultural products can still be used for other things right ? 
  like you can make jams for example and you can also donate it to food banks and there are other options . 
  do you mean restrictions like : - for stays of over three months : the right of residence is subject to certain conditions . 
  eu citizens and their family members -- if not working -- must have sufficient resources and sickness insurance to ensure that they do not become a burden on the social services of during their stay - being able to expel people , or prevent their entry , based on their personal conduct - only being able to have permanent residency after 5 years of uninterrupted legal residency ? 
  regarding the non-eu countries . 
  you do realise they do n't have freedom of movement right ? 
  you do realise many of these are fleeing from a war-thorn country ? 
  there are different kinds of market . 
  a single market , which was derived from a common market . 
  you can negotiate which kind of trade you want with the eu , but you can not negotiate parts of the single market . 
  eu will not sacrifice one of it 's funding and more important principles for the uk . 
  why do you think that the us does n't have access to the single market ? 
  according to your arguments the us is the largest economy in the world , and it would be in the interest of the eu to allow single market access . 
  this does n't mean they are unwilling to negotiate other options . 
  here is an article about different markets : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36083664 here is more information ( jump to slide 10 ) : http://slideplayer.com/slide/4902889/, 
  put yourself in the eu position . 
  why would they open a precedence for limits on freedom of movement ? 
  if the uk is allowed , other would be allowed and that would undermine what the whole eu stands for . 
  the eu is waiting to negotiate with the uk , it 's waiting on article 50 . 
  my point is that some things are not negotiable , i.e. , single market with no freedom of movement , it 's just not a thing . 
  yes , the uk is a large economy . 
  germany , and now france , alone are larger than the uk , put all of the eu together and is much more of an appealing pack than the uk alone . 
  if it becomes choosing between the uk and the eu , i do n't think many would choose the uk unless it made a lot of concessions . 
  again i think you are overestimating thing a bit . 
  the uk can not negotiate properly with the other countries without knowing what the terms are going to be with the eu . 
  part of the uk attractiveness is that is a gateway to eu and the single market . 
  without that you can only negotiate for business to do business in the uk , while before any company registered in the uk could branch or immediately negotiate with a bunch of other countries .

  yeah , how dare they , the mutual fund setup by all nations to provide help to ailing nations , give soft loans to nations in need of economic aid in exchange of actually solving the problems they brought onto themselves ? 
  i mean , it 's not like the imf only grants these soft loans to the nations that request them . 
  they should be severely punished for their crimes . 
  but only after they give away the cash . 
     oh france , why do you let things escalate . 
  this is not needed , uphold your authority . 
  i would put my money on the odds that these so called movements are just yet another front for anti-establishment organizations to try to milk all the anti-establishment propaganda out of these cases while using these illegal immigrants as useful idiots . 
  my guess is that germany does n't hold kind memories regarding groups of foreigners raping german women in german soil . 
   i 'm surprised more europeans have n't heard of the western sydney gang rapes . 
  the parallels are quite strong . 
  as a reference : [ wikipedia article on the sydney gang rapes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sydney_gang_rapes ) . 
   technically you 're right you 're just admitted that your nato claims are bullshit . 
  just give up and stop lying . 
  in case you 're wondering , [ here 's a pic of the polish scientist responsible for surveying the site ] ( http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/zacmbc5lmtb3wmiitavd.jpg ) . 
   it would be only for political reasons if it happens . 
  political and strategic . 
  i assume the ability to transfer train loads of cargo between finland and baltic nations without being forced to go through russia has its advantages . 
   it 's funny really , even the imf came out recently and straight up admitting they were wrong . 
  the imf admitted that they underestimated the economic effect of the proposed spending cuts , and that they were also wrong in bending the rules to offer help to countries that failed to meet the most basic requirements . 
  [ see here . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/05/imf-underestimated-damage-austerity-would-do-to-greece ) it 's very strange that people like you insist in picking up the imf people stating `` we were wrong in giving away money to people who did n't meet the requirements '' and insist in twisting that type of statement saying `` see ? 
  they admit they were wrong ** in doing each and everything i did n't approved and criticized ** . 
  a tad dishonest , do n't you think ? 
   he was removed from syriza i vividly recall him [ announcing his own resignation from his syriza appointment ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/06/greek-finance-minister-yanis-varoufakis-resigns-despite-referendum-no-vote ) and while arguing that the motivating factor was the referendum supported what he defended and he somehow was reluctant to stay the course he advocated . 
  that 's varoufakis in a nutshell . 
  emphasis in nut . 
   is n't he saying that it 's hard to learn the language because swedes do n't like to talk to him ? 
  what language ? 
  swedish or english ? 
   that seems like a fair criticism if true . 
  learning a language with no one to speak to is hard as fuck . 
  it 's obviously bullshit . 
  sweden offers [ free swedish courses to any immigrant . 
  ] ( http://www.stockholm.se/forskolaskola/svenskundervisning-for-invandrare-sfi/swedish-for-immigrants-/ ), 
   ive meet plenty of engineers who lack any organisation skills for anything but their field . 
  we 're not talking about a complex systems engineering project , here . 
  we 're talking about basic stuff , such as asking himself `` i 'm moving to sweden and i want to take my family with me . 
  how 's life over there , and what will it take to get my life up and running ? '', 
  you know , the most basic stuff that anyone moving into any foreign country asks himself before venturing into the unknown . 
  most people plan their week-long trips abroad on holidays with more care than this idiot did with his life-risking adventure into the unknown . 
  what does this say about this moron ? 
  sweden has an awesome higher education system , where nael hamadi could enroll to actually improve his life . 
  but somehow he simply whines . 
  this nael hamadi character does n't sound like he is the brightest bulb in the christmas tree . 
  who in their right mind would subject himself to a notoriously dangerous and life-threatening human trafficking service to actually succeed in reaching his target destination , and then proceed to go back where he first left because he failed to inform himself about what he was doing and now complains about petty bureaucracy and being in a foreign land ? 
  in fact , is n't he supposed to be escaping a civil war ? 
  additionally , the article mentions nael hamadi has a b.a. 
  in engineering , but i seriously doubt that such an idiot , who has such a profound lack of planning skills or even critical thinking , has anything to do with engineering at all . 
  in fact , perhaps that 's why he whines about the `` seven or eight years '' he estimates it would take for him to `` start his life there '' , because it takes anyone just 5 years to get through a full-blown masters degree in engineering . 
   or just something else than sentimentalism and false arguments to try to convince people ? 
  that 's a very odd statement , because the only argument that the separatists play is nothing more than emotional and sentimental bullshit . 
  talk about wanting to have their personal independent cake and eat it too . 
   this is not a schr\u00f6dingers box . 
  it 's schr\u00f6dingers black box : the data only becomes unreadable once they realize it shows the plane did entered turkish airspace . 
   so like spanish submarines ? 
  i suppose you 're referring to spain 's [ s-80 class submarine program ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s-80-class_submarine ) . 
  even with the design issues ( all engineering projects experience them ) , spain managed to setup a submarine industry that is self-sufficient , and enables the spanish navy to equip itself cheaper than buying germany 's export boats . 
  additionally , it appears india is also interested in the subs , which might mean the program may end up paying for itself . 
  spain did very well for themselves . 
   it costs the same or even less ( depending on variant ) as your own typhoons . 
  if by `` the same as '' you mean `` almost twice than '' , you are right . 
  nevertheless , money spent on eurofighters is money spent on eu military and high-tech industry . 
  let 's not forget the people in charge of guine-bissau , a narcostate whose government has well established business ties with colombian drug lords . 
  they are just giving the public what they want to see . 
   theoretically speaking , portugal is also a spain . 
  those are fighting words !, 
  sometimes these loons manage to be their own parodies . 
  it 's a bit hard to play the victim when the video of the candidate being punched in the face is right there for the world to see . 
   honestly , human body is a lot more durable than you would expect . 
  spend a couple of minutes watching vids on liveleak , and you 'll understand that this is n't exactly true . 
   in my opinion this wo n't have a significant impact in election results . 
  in portugal , something similar happened in the presidential elections of 1986 . 
  communist party members assaulted the candidate supported by the socialist party when he visited the town of marinha grande , a notorious communist enclave . 
  the news about the beating ultimately lead him to surge in the polls and double his voting intentions , which lead to his election as president of portugal . 
  [ this news was already posted . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3x46e5/rajoy_spanish_pm_punched_in_the_face_during_a/ ), 
  it 's that time of day where everything is pinned on the dreaded neoliberalism bogeyman . 
  now , imagine if neoliberalism actually had anything to do with this issue . 
  again , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism your argument is simply idiotic . 
   what about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism, 
   how a guy metaphorically describes an area to a newspaper is not exactly objective fact it 's your word against his . 
  he has grenade attacks a a series of shootings to back up his statement . 
  you , on the other hand , only have hand-waiving , baseless assertions and a series of strawman arguments that fail to address the problem . 
   what , i 'm not claiming anything , i 'm stating facts . 
  there 's a goddamn police station there . 
  what are you saying , it 's run by smurfs disguised as police ? 
  you 've claimed there was police there , to which i pointed out reports that the area is described as '' [ not exactly ] the wild west , but something in that direction '' . 
   yes , a guy called amir told a magazine called the local that he feels the gang environment is something in the direction of the wild west . 
  but you 're just some random anonymous guy on the internet claiming otherwise , and the only thing that you can leverage is your baseless assertion . 
  and you 're doing this while desperately trying to lead everyone to turn a blind eye to all the reports and evidences . 
   if you 're talking about roseng\u00e5rd or similar areas , they have more of a police presence than other areas . 
  here 's what [ the local ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20150622/police-concerned-over-malm-wave-of-violence ) had to say about the police presence in roseng\u00e5rd after the infamous grenade attacks and series of shootings :  `` today , the gang environment is ... i do n't want to exactly call it the wild west , but something in that direction , '' amir rostami , a leading authority on sweden 's organized crime groups told the local after two people died in a shooting in the suburb of hisingen in march . 
   not reported by the media if you read what i wrote , you 'll notice i did n't referred to `` the media '' as a whole but to this newspaper in particular . 
  the central point of the ikea murders , and the motivation for the attack , was that the attacker was an illegal immigrant being deported and consequently opted to go on a murder-suicide binge . 
  being the sole motivation behind the act is precisely the definition of relevant . 
  the ikea murders was n't islamic terrorism . 
  iirc , the attacker was an illegal immigrant scheduled for deportation , and decided to go the old murder-suicide route to avoid being sent back . 
  in fact , i believe the two victims were also immigrants . 
  does anyone find it strange that the author of the article makes a point of stating the alleged political allegiance of the attacker right in the article 's leading paragraph ? 
  in the ikea murders , it was obvious right from the start that the [ same newspaper was bending over backwards to omit any reference regarding the alleged attacker ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20150813/cctv-shows-ikea-suspect-tried-to-kill-himself ) , but in this news report the same paper makes a point of associating the attacker with a very specific political allegiance .

   i do n't want a career politician with a phd in political science governing the health care system in my country . 
  why not ? 
  being a minister is having the political responsibility for the assigned portfolio , it 's an inherently political job .

  a little like exporting services only in this case it 's doctors with restricted rights . 
  yes cubans doctors usually go in humanitarian missions on cuban friendly nations . 
  of course this means almost slavery for those who go . 
  they can reject but in the end is the national gov that has the right to propose the candidate . 
   i do think however that we should abolish the 1-state 1-commissioner rule . 
  the ec president should be able to appoint whoever he thinks is best i agree but i 'm very skeptical the eu establishment would find an option that satisfies all member states , especially the smaller . 
  the alternative to the current situation is to democratize and politicize the eu institutions . 
  in that way the parliament should be the most powerful organization and not the council . 
  why the heck should the commission be made up of technocrats ? 
  if they 're there then they are inherently political , afterall it 's a political job . 
  you would be electing the * national * choice to the ec . 
  it 's disingenuous to compare the ec to a supposed pan-european government as if the eu organic is n't suis generis . 
  each commissioner is appointed by national government ( you can have the case where a minority government decide who 's the national choice ) . 
  it 's undemocratic as the choice is n't even decided by national parliaments .

  * but hey they 're moderates !,

  there is n't unregulated immigration , at least use the proper terminology . 
  and virtue is whatever it is , be it center or on the fringes . 
  it was n't between the right and left side of 1920s cpus or between prussian generals and the nazi party . 
  but there never was the case of mass immigration . 
  the fact that people think this is about mass immigration tells us how the populist far right narrative was successful in framing the crisis in their terms . 
  and at least 70 % of comments here would easily be considered far right on the real world . 
  coming here and starting destroying civilization left and right . 
  i 've actually looked at data by organizations like eurostat among others . 
  in france the difference is 0.2 . 
  even then i do n't really care about the ethnic makeup of a nation . 
  i 'm not a fan of branding immense groups of people to a set of stereotypes . 
  every thread that checks on controversial topics far-right users love to drool about quickly becomes a racist piece of shit . 
  it 's like light to mosquitoes .

  if they adopt the recommendation of the jospin report then france will switch to a mixed member majoritarian/parallel voting where the proportional and majoritarian sections are independent , ergo there is n't a corrective nationwide vote as in germany .

  he attacked young people interested in politics . 
  utoya was a summer camp for youngsters of the norwegian labour party . 
  i know you all make a very concerned effort to spread that lie that the refugee crisis was `` allowing mass migration '' or parroting an ethnonationalist falsehood about `` cultural integrity '' . 
  at least you could 've been more discreet about your intentions like not using `` evropa '' a pseudo-latin word popular in far-right circles . 
  that 's not true . 
  there were/are multiple political assassinations from both political sides as well as civil bombings . 
  for example eta did a big favour to spaniards who wanted a democracy ( killing carrero blanco ) while at the far-right killed a bunch of civilians across europe ( bologna massacre for example ) . 
  nope . 
  you certainly do n't have the same kind of rethoric that parties/movements like podemos , fn or m5s spew . 
  what en marche embodies ( so they say ) it 's a different kind of doing politics , a wide centrist movement drawing from civil society and `` reformists '' from the old parties . 
  i 've yet to hear despise for liberal democracy ( other than arrogant tirades about france needing a king and on the same line ) . 
  no he is n't a populist . 
  he 's himself from the elite and as far as i 'm aware he does n't have a simplistic narrative about the pure people against the corrupt elites . 
  also what is the problem that half lrem 's mps are new ?

  unfortunately modern hebrew only got a chance of becoming the main israeli language due to the active suppression of yeddish and other jewish languages . 
  ireland should look at what the basque country or wales is doing . 
  because he did n't align with melenchon in key subjects . 
  back then ? 
  yes . 
   correct me if i 'm wrong sure , it should n't be difficult . 
   but that is called conquest and is exactly what europe is experiencing today . 
  wrong , it 's called migration and it 's actually one of the most ancient human activities . 
  and apart from the donbass conflict it 's not happening in europe . 
   the europeans did n't assimilate to the native american culture . 
  true , within itself and overseas europeans have a long history of cultural genocide and other types of repression on the perceived other . 
   they conqured america true , all of the americas were conquered by europeans or later by nations with elites composed of mostly european ancestry . 
   this is what islam is doing today wrong , islam is not even a centralized religion like the catholic church nor is it unified . 
  and as we 've seen europe is n't being conquered , then we can infer you 're wrong here . 
   and somehow pointing that out is being racist . 
  yes , you 're called racist because you use fringe far-right narratives of contemporary europe as if it 's factual . 
  to sum you 're called racist well because you 're racist . 
  not really . 
  2/10 with rice , would n't correct again . 
  for example the kind of assimilation that the sami or native americans underwent . 
  however i 'd wager culturally greece is closer to turkey or lebanon than to norway . 
  sure but even when the first steps of european integration where made the focus was always to help each country and prevent more wars based on things like `` pure populations '' or the widespread feeling expressed on this thread . 
  to think people here spreading far-right propaganda are in any way a defender of the eu is laughable . 
  the problem with talking with sweeping generalization over a vastly diverse continent is that those grandstanding comments fall short when some one is minimally knowledgeable on the subject . 
  christianity was n't domesticated , the vast majority of european societies just secularized . 
  and saying the continet welcomes radical muslims with open arms is just propagating a simple narrative to complex issues that take and took decades . 
  even if a considerable of european muslims are homophobic or against progressive values then society and those groups ought to improve instead of making dog whistles on how barbaric and uneuropean they are . 
  greek and norwegian culture are also two completely different cultures . 
  what 's the point you 're making ?

  and what makes his apocalyptic calculations even more questionable is the fact that he withholds the costs of the alternatives . 
  in a worst-case scenario , the euro zone would collapse if politicians heeded his advice . 
  the fiasco could cost the germans $ 3.3 trillion , according to a recent report by the german council of economic experts . 
  purely based on this article , this does n't seem very thoughtful to me . 
  seems like he just wants the world to work the way he wants it to , and uses copious amounts of information bias to stick to his guns . 
  i am , of course , open to you and other german redditors , that know him better , to enlighten me on this by teaching me more about his opinions . 
  yeah , because social mobility only depends on your smarts . 
  as someone who lives in lisbon , this scares the shit out of me . 
  the average earthquake lasts between 2-4 minutes , the 1755 lisbon earthquake lasted 8 minutes and destroyed 85 % of lisbon 's buildings . 
  8 fucking minutes and that 's not counting the aftershocks !, 
   that deflation will be counteracted by the inflation caused by printing money . 
  it would but that only means that unlike you previously said , we are not as exposed to high inflation because we start from a deflationary position . 
  i 'd like to know how you are calculating those numbers , it seems to me that you are using a per year basis in some of them while using the total in the others . 
  the yearly budget of both the health and education ministry is around 8 billion euros so i 'm very confused with your numbers . 
  countries like portugal ** are not just as exposed to inflation ** , we had ** -0.21 % ** inflation last june , that 's not inflation , that 's deflation . 
  ergo what you said is just not true . 
   the portuguese government is cutting on education , information , health , wages , etc. 
  these cuts reduce the deficit only by a fraction of what other cuts would . 
  again not true . 
  education and health are by far the biggest expenses in our budgets , therefore any cuts to any of them wield the biggest deficit reduction per the law of diminishing returns . 
  i do agree we have a croonyism problem , but the rest of your post seems mostly propaganda . 
  you 're quite wrong . 
  it would be precisely the opposite . 
  the troubled countries would experience very little inflation due to their austerity measures , while the core countries would have bigger inflation . 
  therefore the troubled ones would regain competitiveness quicker and in a much less painful way than what is currently happening which people call `` internal devaluation '' and involves not only everyone losing purchasing power but a lot of companies going bankrupt too . 
  inflation by printing would be the best thing that could happen to us . 
  in my opinion this is really the only solution at this time . 
  we ca n't do debt forgiveness , we ca n't do eurobonds and i doubt they would be enough at this time , we ca n't politically do jack shit in europe . 
  just print the damn money , lets have some inflation and carry on with our lives . 
  historic revisionism - deal with it - all the other europeans have learned to do it , it 's not that hard . 
  yeah but the unemployed we are talking about here are not people with 15-16 , they are twenty somethings with a degree . 
  they are mostly still living with their parents since they have no money , but that 's like the only thing in common . 
  i 'm not saying this could n't work for a few people , without some college , to learn a trade , but it 's not really a solution for spain . 
  ahh the solution for spanish youth unemployment - working for free - genious . 
  have you not noticed all the countries with negative interest rates ? 
  he seemed to be defending the social democracy , that europe is losing , to me . 
  the maths are the same , you are just changing the base . 
  much more problematic is - how would we get 2 extra fingers ? 
  i suggest we change to base 8 instead , it 's computer friendly and we do n't really need our pinkies . 
  yeah you 're right it 's a moral issue . 
  usually people use the word `` pegged '' by the way . 
   on account of not being part of the euro exactly . 
  indeed , that 's why people keep saying we need more europe , which is one alternative , the other is that everyone just goes their own way . 
  while the factors you have chosen are certainly very important . 
  do you think your country would 've done any better if the ecb had rates much lower than what your country and your country 's inflation needed for a decade ? 
   these countries have lost their economic sovereignty yep pretty much . 
  these plans are not good for us , and they will not solve our problems . 
  however it 's not like we can do anything else until foreign interests say so . 
  it appears you 're right and i was wrong by 1 year . 
  well that sucks ... 
  disregard my last paragraph everyone . 
  ahahah their clothes . 
  sorry , i could n't resist . 
  on a more serious point , i think it 's worse than sch\u00e4uble says - it 's not just the markets - people and countries in the eurozone are losing faith that european leaders and institutions can make the euro work . 
  i frankly do n't know if the eurozone can survive for that long . 
  the delay also seems to throw this decision to around the timeline for german elections which does n't seem innocent to me . 
  in fact it makes it seem like there 's what you would call here `` corruption '' , and judges and politicians are trading favors . 
  i 'm sure i 'm wrong and it 's just my portuguese glasses making me think this . 
  wait a minute !, 
  you 're telling me that if i rub an ordinary tomato ( not a gm one ) i get 3 wishes ? 
  are you trolling me or do you just not understand english ? 
  i 'm saying it is less corrupt now . 
  maybe my english failed me , but what i meant is that portugal is a lot less corrupt ** now ** than it was 20 years ago . 
  i 've edited my post to clarify that . 
  i do n't think the eu handled the greek crisis well * at all * . 
  however if your banks made loans without the proper due diligence and your regulators did not do their jobs correctly , you can hardly blame anyone else if they end up losing money on those loans . 
  of course what europe needs is a better mechanism to deal with our zombie banks than what we 're doing right now . 
  i disagree , i 'm old enough to remember how things were 20 years ago . 
  nowadays portugal is ** a lot ** less corrupt than it was . 
  there are still problems but most of the small time corruption you had when dealing with bureaucracy and other day to day stuff is mostly gone there is also a lot less tax evasion . 
  our justice system still needs some reforms and we still have corrupt politicians but everyone does . 
  sigh ... 
  ** full article : ** finland would consider leaving the euro zone rather than paying the debts of other countries in the currency bloc , finnish finance minister jutta urpilainen said in a newspaper interview friday . 
  `` finland is committed to being a member of the euro zone , and we think that the euro is useful for finland , '' urpilainen told financial daily kauppalehti , adding though that `` finland will not hang itself to the euro at any cost and we are prepared for all scenarios . '', 
  the finance minister stressed that finland , one of only a few european union countries to still enjoy a triple-a credit rating , would not agree to an integration model in which countries were collectively responsible for member states ' debts and risks . 
  she also insisted that a proposed banking union would not work if it were based on joint liability . 
  `` collective responsibility for other countries ' debt , economics and risks ; this is not what we should be prepared for , '' urpilainen said . 
  urpilainen acknowledged in an interview with the helsingin sanomat daily that finland `` represents a tough line '' when it comes to the euro-zone bailouts . 
  `` we are constructive and want to solve the crisis , but not on any terms , '' she said . 
  as part of its tough stance , finland has said that it will begin negotiations with spain next week in order to obtain collateral in exchange for taking part in a bailout for ailing spanish banks . 
  finland has also voiced concern about an agreement reached at an eu summit in brussels last week to use the european stability mechanism ( esm ) to buy bonds to ease the unbearable borrowing costs which are squeezing spain and other vulnerable euro-zone economies . 
  last year finland created a significant stumbling block for the euro-zone 's second rescue package for greece , agreeing to take part only after striking a collateral deal with athens in october 2011 . 
  you can speak german but you ca n't click the [ original ] button on the top right ? 
  frankly , i 'm more of a right leaning kind of guy , but are n't communists all about means of production being shared and against most private property , and nowadays is n't all intellectual property becoming private property and an important mean of production ? 
  you think that 's odd ? 
  the only portuguese guy is someone who was , until very recently , a communist , that later turned socialist . 
  they 're fucking scumbags . 
  their supposed ideologies do n't really matter . 
  in fact , most politicians are scumbags and they know ideologies are much like religions to fool the stupid sheep , they just knew better than vote yes for this . 
  so these guys are not only scumbags but idiots . 
  probably thinks he can troll better this way . 
  the flair is automated right now and easy to change . 
  he 's not greek he 's the resident troll of / r/portugal please do not feed . 
  i meant this :  `` in slovakia , people live of a monthly pension of $ 280 ( $ 350 ) and salaries stand at about $ 400 a month , '' he said . 
  `` it is very difficult to explain to those people why slovakia contributes to assisting countries where ... wages stand at $ 3,500 . '' which seems to me to be either a lie , or purposefully misleading people into thinking the slovakian earning 400 $ could get 3500 $ doing the same thing in one of the troubled countries . 
  it certainly could n't here as that is almost 5 times our average private sector salaries . 
  i can understand the sentiment but ...  contributes to assisting countries where ... wages stand at $ 3,500 where the hell does a slovakian earning 400 $ for a job can get 3500 $ for the same job in the countries having problems ? 
  this ca n't be right . 
  right ? 
  and if it is n't true why reinforce the already problematic public opinion problem with lies .

  the number of deaths correspond to the number of bodies found . 
  they were just missing , for a day there was the doubt about their condition ... 
  fire danger varies a lot from municipality to municipality and along the regions . 
  in the big planes of the south the danger is quite low , those are farming areas with little forest . 
  the region where this happened is by far the most dangerous zone due to the very big forest full of dangerous trees such as pine and most of all eucalyptus . 
  good they 're all moroccan , easy to kick them out and to a country that knows how to deal with people like these . 
  portugal rural areas are being abandoned by locals for decades now ... many foreigners , mostly north europeans , seize the opportunity to buy big plots for little money . 
  they 're the hope to keep these areas populated . 
  there are even some japanese farmers from fukushima that moved to portugal as well ... 
  thought about sharing a bit of good news in the middle of so much horror going on in this region for the past days . 
  this is a dutch family with 6 kids that lives in an isolated area right where the fire passed . 
  for long hours they were feared dead , as they were nowhere to be found and they were not at home . 
  their home survived the fire , although they lost most of their garden . 
  but even the dogs that were at home also survived . 
  luckily for them they were away for that day and when they tried to go back home the road was already closed . 
  they ended up helping 3 other people running from the fire and they took refuge at a belgian couple 's farm as many other people of different nationalities did that day . 
  the belgian couple hosted for a night around 50 people , including germans and czechs , besides this family . 
  shitty journalism happened , but better like this than a real news . 
  both pilots and the mechanic from the non-existent and of undetermined origin plane are fine . 
   even more confusing to ** non-europeans ** . 
  i like your optimism , 
   so yes - work started . 
  the problem is that in some areas you have the feeling that works are never ending ... 
  i also have the impression that an unnecessarily long stretch of road is closed to do works on a much shorter part ... edit : typo, 
  i guess it 's due to comments like this that they 're [ leaving you ] ( http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/equatorial-guinea-joins-community-of-portuguese-language-countries-268594002.html ) ... * evil laughter *, 
  true , they 're the only monolinguals you can find in luxembourg :p, 
   not compromise at all those are the hardliners . 
  not compromising on core principles it 's just common sense . 
  i really do n't think there 's any ongoing claim on belarus ... the policy has been of intentional lack of any visible interest . 
  let 's chat again in 100 years time  well , for the blocks from the 60 's we just need to wait 50 more ... it 's doable !, 
  if there 's something that is not objective is the concept of pretty . 
  i 'm definitely not sure . 
  many people found the eiffel tower a horrible pile of steel ... time heals , people get used to it , it becomes a classic ... also old constructions tend to become rarer with time , as many are demolished/replaced/altered in the meanwhile , so they turn more unique with time as well . 
  we ca n't have empathy for every single tragedy in the world , otherwise we would n't do anything else in life . 
  allow me to be specially sad with a tragedy i relate more to due to thousands of reasons . 
  i just expressed that sorrow , in no way did i deny anyone else 's sorrows ... 
  the first named victim is [ a 4 year old child ] ( http://www.movenoticias.com/2017/06/rodrigo-4-anos-primeira-vitima-mortal-conhecida-do-incendio-pedrogao-grande/ ) , this is beyond sad . 
  at least 3 other children died in the fire . 
  here 's [ a video of the tsunami ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnaoxel48wg ) . 
  although i guess this is not from the hardest hit area . . 
  i mean , it would have been totally awesome . 
  time , i 'm sure , would have transformed it in a love icon just like it did for the current structure . 
   this sounds like some sort of freak firestorm . 
  it was , + than 40\u00bac , super strong winds - some trees broke with the winds , dry thunders ... everything that could go wrong went wrong . 
   i 'm from the area and was there yesterday . 
  awesome , here 's a friendly suggestion , transform all that anger in action . 
  go clean some forest close to your place , cut down eucaliptos , australias and the likes and next autumn plant or seed some oak trees around . 
  i 'm ashamed of your comment . 
  i 'm ashamed of loads of people like you with zero knowledge on the issue hurrying to finger pointing . 
  is this kind of hurried and quickly vanished anger that does n't help in any way . 
  survivors describe `` tornadoes of fire '' , many trees in the region fell with the force of wind . 
  investments have been made , the means to fight the fires are more modern and efficient today than ever before . 
  the biggest problem is structural and needs generations to be solved : the desertification of population and the unhealthy forest invaded by exotic species . 
  yesterday 's weather fenomena were impossible to control and might only get worse with climate change . 
  trees fell down with the wind , wind with 40\u00bac and zero humidity . 
  this is not normal , not in any way . 
  it 's actually quite unexpected and completely exceptional . 
  please save your empty critics for other time . 
  portugal faces severe fires every year but the death toll is always a fraction of this , some years it 's even zero . 
  till yesterday our biggest forest fire tragedy was the death of 25 firemen in the 60 's !, 
  we 're now talking about 57 civilian deaths , this is on all levels exceptional and unexpected . 
  this was a pretty exceptional fire . 
  40 \u00b0 c strong winds and dry thunderstorms . 
  the perfect storm . 
  there are no miracles . 
  43 now :(, 
  43 now :(, 
  60 % is far from always . 
  natural fires do happen . 
  that mayor has been saying lots of idiotic things . 
  in fact everything suggests that this fire was natural , caused by the extreme temperatures and dry thunder storms and strong winds . 
  thought this sub had a strong policy against shitty tabloids . 
  you 're hopeless and theologically ignorant . 
  you just established that all religions are equal and islam especially deserves all your sympathy cause . . because . 
  religions are ideas , and they are all quite different . 
  islam especially uses violence as a way of spreading . 
  just like christianity used to do , till it reformed - thanks in big part to all the critics and heretics , and became a mostly humanist and pacifist movement ( even if some violent sects till persist ) . 
  in islam violence is much more predominant , from the holy book to everyday reality in countries with significant muslim populations . 
  but why am i wasting time , you do n't give a fuck about reality , you decided that religions are all the same and deserve equal treatment , even if the outcome of that is huge differences in treatment of people ... it 's the suicide of the left , this stupid idea that it the religions , and not the people , that should be treated equally . . this will cost us everything . 
  i 'm really fed up . 
  you clearly have no idea what 's in there . 
  i trust you to be able to read it without becoming a terrorist though . 
  like millions of people . 
  once again , go read the koran . 
  you 're in denial . 
  go read the koran . 
  radio people fooling the continent with their seductive voices ... 
  being a german is just having a nationality , you have little control on that . 
  being a muslim is a having a set of beliefs , whose actual interpretation may vary tremendously among muslims , but still , shared beliefs . 
  my source is the article from the post , that is , the guardian . 
  would be nice if you explained your sources instead of downvoting my comment . 
  according to the article that 's simply germany 's biggest umbrella organisation for muslims . 
  well i gave you a few examples , waiting for yours . . 
  wow that 's really cool , it 's not so easy to find european stuff . . so much easier to decorate everything in union jack style . . :p, 
  there 's at least 4 other related posts but i upvote anyway , good news must be praised , 
  denmark 's result is quite disappointing for a country with high hopes of hosting the ema after brexit . . czechia and slovakia , you really went separate ways , did n't you ? 
  mostly in trade wars ... 
  maybe they 're under-represented in the rest of society ... when one does n't know one just assumes someone else is straight , and that 's often not the case . 
  in case there is some over-representation there could be some explanations for it . 
  it 's hard for politicians to have a family life , women politicians frequently do n't have children ( may , merkel . . ) , that could have an impact maybe .

  we will make the spanish pay the wall . 
  ahead of spain, 
  it is based in london so it might be a little biased . 
  then how come the us produces so much more co2 and waste ? 
  i just hope for the best for france . 
  macron seems to be handling the situation quite well .

  obligatory comment, 
  kill them with rational behaviour . 
  estonia is one of the most atheist countries out there . 
   best quotes from famous people ** from europe ** it is full of american quotes !, 
  first their ambassador now their army choir . 
  this looks fishy . 
  that music starting at 0:06 with the camera zoom in and out made me laugh . 
  hahaha, 
  our is better . 
  doubt that , if angela merkel speaks again against the us the news will be flooded with corruption just like when dilma did it . 
  that 's beautiful .

  / r/dota2, 
  i think its really unfair to say england has invaded portugal . 
  we were part of spain at the time . 
  they are supposed to say that . 
  would n't relate it directly with game of thrones, 
  people are treating the french army like it was the american one . 
  i do n't know why catalonia tries to make these referendums . 
  they will not be recognized by spain and if spain does n't recognize them they wo n't be able to join the eu or have any kind of support within it . 
  but why, 
  cereals or a toast with cheese and tea . 
  i like her .

  i always hear that american barbecue is good but the only couple times i ate i disliked it . 
  the meat did n't feel and taste meaty enough and the crusts were unpleasant to eat . 
  because they gave us money . 
  we just misused it . 
  you will never take our chorizos alive !, 
  i have a friend who was born in portugal and all his educations , apart from 5 years in andorra , were in portugal and his parents are both from portugal . 
  but those 5 years in andorra were enough for him to think he is from catalonia and that he is being oppressed by the castillans . 
  i always try to say it like it is : you are portuguese . 
  but i think he now thinks portuguese people are oppressing catalonia too . 
  it is a strange sentiment i have towards him and i always wondered what the hell is going on in catalonia .

  even the 4chan post where that originated debunked the supposedly files leaked because it was very bad framed/photoshopped . 
  yeah that 's true haha, 
  good point by macron actually . 
  if she wants to stop terrorism why is she voting against the measures in discussion ? 
  i do n't understand what le pen is trying to say . 
  i barely see ford fiestas . 
  in what country are they so popular ? 
  what does that have to do with democracy ? 
  might be because you didnt follow the rules of the subreddit . 
  your account got banned 3 minutes ago because democracy ? 
  israel one is actually interesting . 
  considering russia was the first to help them and most of their habitants are russian of ancestry . 
  she asked for it ... and misused it it . 
  at least she did n't suck daddy 's dick to get where she is .

  we do n't have strong regional policies at all . 
  but we 're a small country anyway . 
  and yes , our politicians are pretty fucked up . 
  specially if you talk about our two last prime ministers ( one `` socialist '' ( like psoe ) and one `` social-democrat '' ( like pp ) were probably the worst two prime ministers since we 're a democracy . 
  and the new pm ... we 'll see . 
  yes , but apparently do n't drink from our wine . 
  thought it was good but i guess i was wrong . 
  this map raises more questions than it answers . 
  1st of all , massive discrepancy between portugal and spain . 
  i do n't see a reason for this massive gap to exist . 
  secondly : were n't the nordic countries supposed to have a much larger life expectancy since life is so much better over there and there is less inequality between the richest and the poorest ? 
  speaking of that i wonder how the gibraltarians ( gibraltians ? 
  the rock people ! ), 
  are dealing with brexit . 
  well , shit . 
  that 's beautiful . 
  i have a very similar picture to the ukrainian one on my computer for three years or so . 
  beautiful . 
  but all of them are really good . 
  losing an argument usually is the point where people remember that they have a life . 
  that 's cool . 
  so weird nobody has an answer to you . 
  i guess people who hold any kind of socialism as stalinism did n't really think things through . 
  * much less than . 
  well , honestly i knew of her because she 's the sister of eva gabor from green acres , a show that was somewhat famous in my country . 
  just googled zwarte piet . 
  was not disappointed . 
  no because : 1 ) he talked a lot about being against the tpp . 
  not the ttip ; 2 ) policies do n't magically desintegrate once a new government takes over . 
  he did n't even take over yet . 
  he was n't even voted in the true election , the one where the electors choose who takes charge . 
  that should happen in a few hours , though ; 3 ) even if he said he is against tpp and possibly other trade agreements , he can always be pressuated . 
  and i 'm sure there will be many powerful people presuading him to not oppose the trade agreements once he takes office . 
  but yes , i hope the ttip and other trade agreements like this one fail and fail hard . 
  i do n't believe for one second trump will actually be against the when it matter butif he does i 'll be very grateful . 
  well that should change eventually as america and the eu agree on pseudo-secret pacts like the ttip . 
  haha , exactly !, 
  well , for starters that we have `` a '' ( singular ) culture . 
  and you say that knowing perfectly this is just a curiosity and no one will take the time to actually check your claim . 
  ok , fair enough . 
  you say you have documents , you mean . 
  oh that `` redneck '' comment i made was `` crying '' ? 
  ok , whatever you say , billy-bob . 
  cheers . 
  omg you trump supprters are such delicate flowers . 
  ca n't find a more pc crowd you guys . 
  why the hell should i stick to local politics ? 
  i know more about your country 's politics than most people in your country . 
  and you should really google the meaning of `` racism '' . 
  unlike clinton , trump and johnson ... face it , this election was the election of idiots . 
  stein was by far the better choice . 
  you 're right . 
  it 's a bunch of racist rednecks in the countryside that are ready to do sum lynchin ' like their gran ` daddies that should decide , even if they are the minority . 
  and as the popular vote did n't win , most people live under a government they did n't vote for . 
  makes perfect sense . 
  that `` union of countries '' argument is complete bullshit , let 's be honest . 
  the `` countries '' already have their state `` government '' as they have a governor . 
  but the presidency is supposed to be voted by the general public . 
  ouch . 
  savage . 
  can only talk for myself , but yeah , maybe some people . 
  wtf ? 
  i saw several times your `` georgia \u2229 europe \u2260 \u2205 '' and for some reason i read `` georgia \u2229 europe ** = ** \u2205 '' . 
  nevermind , i 'm fucking blind . 
  you 're right . 
  and yes , it makes sense that georgia is a transcontinental country as well . 
   georgia and europe has a non-empty intersection do n't you mean to say that they have an empty intersection , since you are arguing one is not contained in the other ? 
  as for the map , it is arguable if it is correct or not . 
  what is factual is that they lie in between of european russia and asian turkey . 
  as far as i know , they mostly think of themselves as european . 
  and , since there is no actual definition of what a continent is ( ie : i 'll defend until i die that australia is not a continent , but many say otherwise ) and geography does not provide a clear result , i agree with most georgians . 
  therefore , assuming georgia is part of europe , your math does not check out . 
  he should double-czech his math , though . 
  that wc does n't really look very safe . 
  it would scare the shit out of me . 
  but that 's probably the plan anyway . 
  i always knew merkel was hiding something . 
  and now the world finally knows . 
  i do n't know ... have you ever seen german porn ? 
  it 's all a conspiracy from osho . 
  i bet you even think he died . 
  or did he ? 
  i know she does - i literally commented on a video of her speaking in russian with astronauts . 
  i was just making an attempt of a stupid joke . 
  i think she does too . 
  ^ ok , ^ i 'll ^ see ^ myself ^ out ... 
  bratil . 
  it would be way worse if they put a spanish flag there . 
   i mean d most important law according to christ is love . . is it really ? 
  i can see why decent people would associate jesus with love . 
  i really do . 
  but if you really look into the bible , he really is n't very keen on poeple who do n't want to follow him . 
  he kinda wants to bring death and destruction to the non-followers and make them suffer an eternity in hell for the `` sin '' of not believing in him . 
  it was a second round . 
  it 's normal that many people will vote for the least of two evils if their guy is not up there . 
  did anyone here actually watch the debate ? 
  i hate le pen but she fucking wiped the floor with macron last night . 
  he could not counter her accusations that basically he is basically the bitch of the corporations . 
  the fact that france ended up choosing these two assholes for the 2nd round is absolutely insane . 
  it would be / r/la _ le_pen .

  you do n't know that . 
  they are undocumented people that france determined to come from mali . 
  mali refused them on the basis of the lack of documents . 
  that 's the story . 
  you said they were not malian , and you do n't know that . 
  i trust much more the bureaucrats in france that did deal with the people in question than i trust your prejudiced guess . 
  accessing one 's nationality is not that difficult when you have translators that can distinguish dialects from specific regions . 
  by taking a stronger stance against migrants that destroy their documents and against their own countries when they refuse to take them back , you can create examples and end the practice . 
  right now , because no one seems to care , it 's the smartest move , to arrive in europe and burn your passport . 
  eventually another way would be the australian way , probably in the near future when populism really starts winning elections in europe and panic takes over the establishment . 
  then europe will bribe/threat some country , possibly tunisia , in order to become host of an ofshore processing center of refugees/migrants . 
  that alone will discourage future migrants , like it happened in australia . 
  it 's a nasty policy , rather cruel , but , it 's still far enough from nazism and murder , and let 's face it , it really works . 
  the boats pretty much stopped . 
  how do you know that ? 
  mali just refused them because they had no documents . 
  mali did n't access their nationality . 
  you ca n't know that , for sure france did investigations before sending them there . 
  mali is not on the other side of the world , is actually quite close to europe . 
  and i never suggested that , but europe ca n't be stuck with undocumented people with no legitimate right for asylum when europe has means to determine their nationality through other means - people talk and have dialects that are closely connected to specific geographic locations . 
  if burning your documents it 's all you need for you to be granted right to stay in europe for ever than we really need a fortress . 
  how did i lie ? 
  i just find this particular issue irrelevant , it 's an article in a british newspaper about a crook hiding in the ecuatorian embassy . . is this relevant , how ? 
  i did n't even read the interview or the said article , i do not care . 
  edit : i 'm just get fed up of seeing this bunch of crooks ( assange , snowden , greenwald ) being constantly quoted on this sub as reliable sources : they are not . 
   force us to scrutinize his claims more closely , not disregard them entirely . 
  it 's an article on a british newspaper , i do n't find this particular subject so relevant . 
  it 's not like british press is normally so accurate and unbiased . . 
  europe really needs to get tougher on this issue . 
  the terrorist of berlin was not taken back by tunisia because his passport had expired ? 
  it 's absurd , unacceptable . 
  i wonder if any european would be refused entry in europe for that reason . 
  europe has to take a much stronger stance against countries that refuse to take back their citizens . 
  that said , this particular case is a bit fishier as the guys had no documents . 
  but i trust the french authorities did sufficient quests to determine their nationality and therefor seems reasonable to demand mali to take them back . 
  our migration laws are good as they are , but if we keep on not applying them , populists promising zero migration and 100 % expulsions will come to power . 
  it 's on the best interest of rightful refugees that these processes are done correctly and as fast as possible . 
  europe has the power to demand these countries to accept their citizens back , it 's time to exercise that power . 
  i 've no idea , never heard of . 
  this matter alone is unimportant , a translation being considered biased . . pff . 
  apart from this , greenwald is effectively a crook who deserves no credibility . 
  he 's a fakenews agent . 
  part of the mob that gave us trump for 2017 . 
  edit : the downvoters are clearly overrating the influence of the guardian in the world affairs . 
  only if . . at least there would be no brexit . 
  this issue is interpretive and the guardian already rephrased their article . 
  but fuck reality , conspiracy theorists can see a world in any given nonsense . 
  greenwald is a crook , he deserves zero credibility . 
  not really , no . 
  most likely it was random criminality . 
  [ commemorative ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_euro_commemorative_coins#2017_coinage ) , although the tone of the news sounds otherwise ... 
  many people do n't see that well , and could in fact confuse both due to sight problems . 
  but apart from that i 'm sure i 'm not the only one doing my usual shopping in a distracted/fast pace . 
  when i go to the supermarket after work all i think is being as fast as possible to get home quick . 
  several times i bought wrong stuff , the only case that did piss me off was a non-alcoholic beer package , pff . 
  that 's another issue , if it 's ethical to give meaty names to meatless products . 
  or milky names to vegetarian drinks . . 
  i 'm unsure about it , even though i do drink soy milk and eat vegetarian meaty stuff some times . 
  but i was commenting on the possible confusion issue , which i think it 's real , but more easily solved by supermarkets separating the products in different sections . 
  you see a familiar logo and you put it in your cart . 
  true that in this case is the brand logo , and not a meat reference , that makes it confusing . 
  but if you 're doing a quick shopping after work you 're probably not in the mood to be so attentive to every buying you do , especially when you just grab a familiar logo in a familiar package . 
   are germans collectively buying vegetarian meat can in fact be misleading if they 're not in a separate section of the supermarket . 
  most shoppers do n't read all the small print/logos . 
  for instance [ this ] ( http://www.wiwo.de/images/currywurst-im-veggie-style/13070182/4-format2114.jpg ) is very similar to the [ original meat version ] ( http://www.meica.de/fileadmin/_migrated/pics/meica-curryking-currywurst-l-og.png ) . 
  do n't underestimate the power of clich\u00e9s and stereotypes . 
  many people believe this , with positive and negative consequences for germany . 
  on the positive side they easily sell products more expensively than they should be , due to the german brand . 
  on the negative side many germans are so convinced this is true that they cope very poorly with change and foreign criticism , believing that what they 're doing must be more efficient anyway . 
  in reality it 's an extremely bureaucratic country , full of never ending road works and delayed trains . 
  any other european country would just be too embarrassed by this , so it would n't be possible such a failure . 
  only germany , with it 's strong brand of `` german efficiency '' , can cope with such a disaster . 
  is it really more expensive ? 
  that 's not what i understood , a dutch friend had a baby recently and i was surprised they did a passport for the baby just to go on holidays in austria , and they said it was the same price as an id , so they went for the passport instead . 
  i remember a poll that showed czech republic as the least religious country in europe . 
  in portugal most people ( 87 % ) will say they 're catholic but only 13 % of the population claims to attend regularly to religious services ( of any religion ) . 
  ok , my source is a dutch friend that says they 're not mandatory , like in most countries that issue id cards and they are as expensive as passports . 
  so , according to him , people just make a passport as that allows you to travel far and avoid the id card . 
  some countries do n't issue them even . 
  id cards are not so common in the netherlands and cost as much as a normal passport . 
  anyway i used the word `` passport '' in its wider sense of identification document . 
  but according to the article she did get a letter saying precisely that she should leave . 
  so anyone applying for a permanent residency permit in the uk must give away their passport for 6 months !? 
  considering that you need you passport just for crossing the channel , as the uk it 's not schengen , this is rather harsh . 
  you want permanent residency ? 
  you must stay permanently then . 
  he might feel disheartened with the drama of the new berlin airport construction . . there goes your german efficiency myth down the drain . . 
  i 've lived in germany before and i still live close by enough to know that the myth is mostly a myth and germany can be spectacularly inefficient and bureaucratic . 
  partially due to the strong belief in the myth , `` whatever we 'll do , it will be more efficient anyway 'cause we 're german '' . 
   they will build that factory to get a foothold in germany i mean , there 's this eu thing called common market that makes it totally doable to have a factory in one country even if your main market is another country . 
  tesla is an american brand , and putting a factory in germany wo n't change that . 
  germany certainly has some advantage points , but also comes with some disadvantages : higher costs for land and labor , lower solar energy potential , shortage on skilled labor - german industry has been complaining about that for years . . once again , their pick in the us was nevada , not detroit . 
  portugal is safe all around , go off the beaten track without fear  if you compare it to italy it 's pretty much under-touristed everywhere ... 
  lol it 's true , brexit it 's a boy . . even in portuguese , but in my head it makes more sense in the feminine in both languages , it 's a sortie/sa \u00edda after all :p, 
  i think lonelyplanet had us for 2016 , they 're a bit ahead . . 
  no , i 'm an exiled southerner in northern lands , but i come from northern portugal . . so just made a word game with north and south . . all options were taken , in the end that was the confusing result :p, 
  would n't it be wiser to wait for the actual brexit to confirm itself ? 
  if it never happens will be weird to have a `` rue de la brexit '' address ... 
  their american factory is in nevada btw . 
  there are still many options away from the touristic hotspots . . pretty much all interior , most north ( except douro valley and porto ) , most azorean islands ... and every corner has its charm .

it means that tolerate and educate is more productive than punishing . 
  if you disagree , you are disagreeing with most known science and history . 
  edit : and no , i 'm not suggesting that we should tolerate rapings , we totally should n't . 
  i 'm just suggesting we tolerate and educate the refugees instead of bundling them up and calling them all rapists . 
   i would say its a pretty good success story for austerity in latvia . 
  the point of comparing to russia is that russia is not a good example , and latvia is comparable to russia . 
  the author is arguing that latvia is a success because the bar was set so low for her . 
   im gon na need some sourcing for the ( ... ) bullshit latvia 's economy is converging to eu standard , it 's low wages attract industries from other countries , industries that previously were attracted by the low wages of portugal . 
  basically , by entering eu , latvia and other eastern countries are getting the factories and low income jobs that were previously the main force behind the south 's growth . 
  i 'm not bitter , nor angry , it 's normal , and i 'm glad you are growing . 
  but for fuck sake , do n't say austerity played a part , because it did n't . 
  if you look at the graphic comparing iceland and latvia you will notice that two countries with similar gdp 's had very similar performances despite very different policies ; the complete opposite of austerity actually . 
  what that is trying to prove is that you can not attribute latvia 's success to austerity without considering many other factors . 
  austerity ( arguably ) works when used in a counter-cyclical way , but when not , it does n't work . 
  and there are [ 100 years of data to prove that ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-13/one-hundred-years-of-austerity ) . 
  they also said portugal is a success story for austerity ... 
  it 's not . 
  http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2013/01/03/latvia-is-a-success-story-if-by-success-story-you-mean-disaster/ `` the main really good news about latvia , rapid productivity growth , arguably had more to do with the catchup of a very poor country by european standards than with macro policy . '', 
  baltics are playing catchup . 
  piigs already played catchup in the 80 's . 
  that is the definition of deficit . 
  but no one is richer because they are spending more money than they have , nor it means that the country is better or spending money on it 's population if they have a deficit . 
  the country is living above it 's means , not the people . 
  it 's totally different . 
  but this is irrelevant , because the human argument `` people have been living above their means , so they are only balancing '' is totally flawed . 
  because people have n't been living above their means , it 's just their governments that have been overspending lavishly . 
  and the economic argument `` austerity to balance the bills '' is also completely flawed , because data has shown that ( as i said ) the positive benefits from austerity on the debt-to-gdp ratio are nullified by the negative impact on gdp caused by spending cuts and tax increases . 
  but hey , you do n't need to believe me , you have 100 years of history to tell you austerity is wrong : http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-13/one-hundred-years-of-austerity, 
  well , sorry ... 
  i guess i was baffled by how could someone write something like that . 
  it 's ... stupid ( sorry again )  right now , countries with deficit are making people richer than are supposed to be . 
  the only thing you can prove by looking at the deficit is that the country is spending more than it gets ... 
  the people are richer than it should be is a completely baseless assumption . 
  edit : besides , it 's somewhat offensive to have a french guy telling me that the portuguese government has been making people richer by spending too much ... jesus fucking christ , it 's completely ridiculous ... 
  and besides the cuts in social spending , add the increase in taxes . 
  a lot of taxes were increased and that threw even more people into unemployment and welfare . 
  just the sudden vat increase of more than 10 % to restaurants , threw a fuckton of businesses to bankruptcies and thousands to unemployment . 
  more people to be supported by an already shrinkened social welfare system . 
  and point is , you ca n't deny welfare to those people , because a % of their salaries goes to the welfare fund . 
  so they cut from other people , usually those who need it the most and complain the less . 
  meanwhile , you see `` excesses '' everywhere ; not being cut . 
  because they support a lobby somehow . 
   no country in europe under [ the type of ] austerity [ we are talking about ] recovered . 
  counter-cyclical austerity which country ? 
  `` rational fiscal policy , as i have written many times before , should always be countercyclical , or at least cyclically neutral . '', 
  `` but did n't austerity `` work '' in the baltics ? 
  well , yes , it worked -- in the same sense that throwing up your dinner is better than dying of food poisoning . '', 
  `` the reason we can not point to the baltics as a success story for austerity is that there is no such thing . 
  by its nature , the very need for austerity is a sign that there has already been a policy failure . '', 
  http://www.economonitor.com/dolanecon/2013/10/18/why-the-baltic-recovery-is-not-a-success-story-for-austerity-lessons-for-the-us/ `` poland has performed better largely because , rather than implementing the european elite 's preferred policy of austerity , it has actually had extremely accommodating fiscal and monetary policies . '', 
  http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2013/03/23/how-austerity-is-failing-in-eastern-europe-in-one-chart/ `` finally , almost half of ireland 's dramatic increase in gdp is from multinational activity , which does not take place in ireland . 
  thus , much of ireland 's growth is based on facilitating some of the most profitable global corporations and financial services in reducing the tax they otherwise would have to pay to countries across the world . 
  this is an unethical , unfair , and ultimately unsustainable form of economic activity . '', 
  http://www.irishexaminer.com/viewpoints/analysis/irelands-austerity-success-is-no-model-for-greece-340662.html but if all this is not enough : http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-13/one-hundred-years-of-austerity, 
   right now , countries with deficit are making people richer than are supposed to be . 
  roflmao wtf lol bbq . 
  [ incredibly creative offensives i ended up removing ] . 
  portugal is n't a rich country since the 16th century . 
  portuguese engineers get 1/5th of the salary a german engineer gets and pays the same for food and electronics . 
  1/5th of the portuguese workforce gets less than 500 $ , the rest does n't get much more , but one bedroom in lisbon costs 250 $ plus expenses . 
  25 % of the spanish workforce is unemployed . 
  you . 
  must . 
  joking . 
   austerity only tries to come back to a normal level . 
  portugal went back 20 years . 
  we are in 95 economic levels . 
  are we good now ? 
  a crisis hits every 7 years . 
  next crisis should be hitting in 6 to 24 months ( business cycles , google it up ) . 
  so when the next crisis hits , same logic applies ( we are living above possibilities ) and more austerity comes up and we regress 20 more years . 
  and then in 2023 it will be 60 years and we will be living in pre-revolution era economic levels . 
  fucking brilliant right ? 
  managing the economy is not managing your house . 
  if you are actively making people poorer , you are also sending your economy back in time and it will take time to recover again . 
  you are not fixing anything , you are just destroying ; because every new austerity measure , everytime you `` make people poorer '' , you punish the economy and you reduce the gdp , making the people richer than they should be again . 
  because * most of the financial benefits of increasing taxes and cutting wages are directly reflected through decreases in gdp . 
  less gdp means less income and more deficit again . 
  so it 's a cyclic policy . 
  it does n't solve anything . 
  in fact it makes worse . 
  but just look at the fucking numbers . 
  no country in europe under austerity recovered . 
  when your answer is always austerity , you will end up not being able to stop using austerity until there is no more taxes do increase or wages to cut . 
  do you get the problem now ? 
  a solution that advocates for making people poorer , will obviously reduce the countries income and increase it 's debt , and it 's not a fucking solution . 
  lol , that 's totally not what i said, 
  it was an hyperbole . 
  from wikipedia  '' another historical example of austerity was in the united states , which nearly balanced its budget from 1998 to 2001 during an economic boom ( as keynes advocated , rather than during a bust ) . '', 
  i underline : '' ( as keynes advocated , rather than during a bust ) '' . 
  exactly the opposite of what the fuck we did in europe . 
  exactly the freaking fucking opposite . 
  austerity works sometimes , yes . 
  but not when applied on a weak economy . 
  i 'm not talking about the finnish economy . 
  this conversation started with `` is n't that exactly what the pigs countries were doing before they went bankrupt ? '' . 
  i do n't know what will work with finland , but i know what does n't work anywhere : austerity . 
  no , im talking about friedman and keynes also . 
  did n't knew about that one .

  in portugal now you can also choose greek and chinese after your 1st grade , i think .

  found that funny too tbh ... 
  i was like , is n't this against the point you 're trying to make ? 
  this . 
  europa 's a greek word too , i think , so i guess we also have to thank them for that . 
  it does lag behind in some aspects , but most people in the us are quite up there education wise . 
  well , europe = europa in portuguese , so it 's not much of a change to us . 
  greece wins it , i think . 
  portugal 's looks a bit too try hard . 
  just get a god damn toilet booth with an open/closed sign . 
  sup nick ? 
  that 's true ... 
  guess it 's because most of the true rural portugal is more than 200km away . 
  the north of portugal is very active tourism wise , so most know enough english to sell their products/services . 
  alentejo is another story altogether ... 
  i know why portugal 's not there ... dude 's take days to deliver something from one side of the country to the other while stuff i get from japan gets here overnight . 
  look at the edit on my post . 
  it sorta makes sense , in my case at least .

  they are explaining the european refugee crisis , whilst attempting to conflate the entirety of the masses of people as being syrian , which by the numbers germany is finding does not match that perception . 
  some of them [ do n't ] ( https://youtu.be/hzmgyfqnvvu?t=2m27s ) like us very much . 
  english is the only language i speak . 
  the ** european refugee crisis ** , the one that 's in the news right this very moment , that 's where the 20 % figure comes from . 
  * the ** european refugee crisis ** and syria explained thats the title of this thread and the video title , your claim would make more sense if the title was . 
  * the syria refugee crisis explained, 
   seems a lot of people here wish they lived in japan though . 
  please no , leave my waifus alone !, 
  * hugs *, 
  it 's not exactly an easy question to answer , for me broadly speaking i 'd say culturally and ethnically is what i consider a european . 
  as an example i consider americans ( north and south ) to be variants of european . 
   i do n't understand how that means we should n't be helping syrian refugees ? 
  i have n't seen anyone make this argument . 
  its funny in a way though.in a few threads i have seen people complaining about being called nazis , these people have in turn been told that they are just making it up or maybe they are trying to head of criticism , and then here in this thread two posts already claiming `` racists '' , `` nazis '' . 
   apparently being not unconditionaly pro immigration gives you several phobias . 
  also dead babies man , you would n't want to be responsible for that again right ? 
   only 20 % he is talking about the current crisis . 
   people will assimilate quickly ... so long as we are accepting , and welcoming . 
  the ** reality ** is quite different from your assertion . 
   do say ? 
  why would they do that ? 
  if they could just go back home . 
  or back to those great turkish and lebanese camps . 
  that would be great , would n't it ? 
  what they could try doing is respecting the laws of the countries to which they are asking help from , is this to much to ask ? 
   how is that in any way indicative for the notion that the would would n't agree to a process were they were distrubuted throughout the eu as long as they got asylum ?!, 
  its like your just throwing stuff at the wall , assuming it will stick . 
  when people criticize these people for wanting to go to specific countries a whole host of excuses are given , they want the best start in life , or , they want to be reunited with family . 
  what will change between what is happening now and the future that will alter this behaviour ? 
  it is a perfectly reasonable assumption that certain countries will be favourite destinations for migrants . 
   you know , if some of them are demanding something , it means that every last one of them are the same . 
  carry on . 
  there was an awful lot of them trying to break into hungary . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-34270077 ) is some info from a source used in the video . 
   ** syrians are a small minority of those seeking refuge in germany **  while the tragedy of those fleeing syria 's terrible civil war has caught the popular imagination , such people formed just 20.1 % of those seeking asylum in germany from january to august 2015 . 
  if the makers of this video were such a reputable group they obviously know this information , why are they misrepresenting what is going on ? 
   comeon now you 're not even trying !, 
  it 's not like poland is getting its doors bashed down by people clamouring to get in , shit even austria got bypassed in favour of germany . 
  based on the choices in which this current and the previous waves of migrants decided to settle , it is reasonable to make the prediction that they will continue to do so in the future . 
   `` news '' do you mean actual video footage of refugees demanding to be let into hungary , cause `` we want germany '' . 
  we are not only dealing with syrian refugees but migrants from all over the world and he kept on conflating syrian refugees with migrants in general , it 's almost like he was trying impress on the viewer that a migrant is the same as a refugee , also the dead baby thing at the end was just really classy . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:academic_use http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k70847&amp;pageid=icb.page346376 just like reddit has brigades so does wikipedia . 
  they say that immigrants are less likely to cause crime than locals when they are employed . 
  tell me mr swede , is this the case in your lovely country ? , or are migrants over represented in the statistics ? 
   where is this ` collective sharing of refugees initative ' that you say the syrians have outright rejected ? 
   have you been watching any news within the last few weeks ? 
  captain ausfalia to the rescue , let me guess you are from melbourne right ? 
  the gaurdian , vox , the economist , the wall street journal , wikifuckingpedia , much credible sources they are . 
  as the recent crisis has shown this 1 % increase will not consent to be spread out around europe . 
  they make an assumption that the majority of these migrants will get work , and they are also leading people to the conclusion that the current refugee influx is only a temporary thing . 
  and the sources , wikipedia , a bunch of news outlets , the majority of those sources are heavily biased towards mass immigration , you might as well use russia today as a source when talking about ukraine . 
   before that there was a lot of pro-federalism threads here . 
  the mild taste of what federalism would entail vis-a-vis quotas , has probably soured many people against ever closer union . 
  `` immigrants less likely to commit crimes than local population , ** when allowed to work ** . '', 
  this person also assumes that there is a set number of refugees and that will be the end of it , the truth is that for the foreseeable future there is no end in sight .

  at least he got a date . 
  why the hate ? 
  we were already occupied ? 
  being occupied by a bigger realm does n't really change things . 
   for a few decades this is the important part . 
  apart from a period when we were occupied we were never a part of spain . 
  spain got its border in 1492 , we got ours in 1143 . 
  germans have long done that . 
  the german government not so much . 
  they may have tried but they did n't succeed . 
  i do n't live there  do ask in / r/portugal , they tend to be helpful to foreigners .

  this is _ not _ a war . 
  if this were a war the european industrial output would be enough to glass the whole of the middle east . 
  islam would be found only in museums and history books . 
  this is the world 's biggest economic block trying to keep its public services not blown up while not thinking too hard about it . 
  so we 'll get people . 
  seriously , give me a real problem . 
  i was talking about the internal french services . 
  there 's been too many attacks in europe for them to be coordinated . 
  of course they would . 
  but if britain withdraws we ca n't let the eu crumble because then others would suffer even more . 
  and who says we ca n't hold the line without britain ? 
  who says the eu does n't already have what it takes to take on jihadis ? 
  but not people , which is what the intelligence services deal with . 
  in fact , i 'd say war has nothing to do with this . 
  oh yes , absolutely . 
  for a while , until we built capabilities . 
  nothing we have n't seen before . 
  smaller nations ran successful counter terror operations during their colonial periods . 
  or what ? 
  and yet small nations did it successfully . 
  there 's no two options . 
  europe is getting closer and closer brexit not withstanding and economic realities mean that eu security services will simply start to work closer together . 
  as for the cost , we 're not exactly samoa . 
  i guess we should start now then . 
  i do n't see the difficulty . 
  there is a definitive lack of political will in france to get it done , probably hollande 's inability to wrangle all interests that the 6 agencies represent , but to say its `` quite hard '' is an overstatement . 
  why does n't the eu up its intelligence capabilities ? 
  seriously . 
   if it somehow shows that you swipe regularly and there 's just one missing in a long time thats what happened to me , so having a record helps . 
  not really . 
  morning commute , half a sleep . 
  did i swipe in or not ? 
  ( this is what gets me all the time ) . 
  again , the whole `` we give you one free lunch before a death sentence '' would only work if humans are machines . 
  as i said , i 'm a multiple fare dodger and not a single one of them was on purpose . 
  humans live a long time , giving them a criminal record over something they can easily forget is not ... optimal . 
   the train companies will only file a complaint with the police if someone is a repeat offender . 
  i 've dodged fares more than once and it was always accidentally . 
  too distracted to remember i touched in or something similar . 
  to even think this gets to the police is insane . 
  i could understand if i did n't pay the many fines i accumulated but to be prosecuted for effectively just being a normal citizen is pretty insane . 
  seriously ? 
  guy gets on the train drunk to go home and ends up with a criminal record ? 
   which basically comes down to using a train without a valid ticket . 
  that 's a crime ? 
  should n't it be a fine ? 
  no it 's not . 
  so our immigration policy is n't a cheap copy of yours ?

  the position fell off .

  til you say wtf in both english and dutch . 
  props to him for managing to keep a straight face the entire time , i bet it helps that he was actually pissed at erdogan and that he 's a comedian but still there had to be someone at least grinning behind the scenes . 
  nah , i just though of adding a ( slightly related ) random fact :p, 
   politicians should lead , and govern with the population 's best interests at heart ( with their consent ) , not follow and give people what they want . 
  it just so happens that a lot of the times those politicians put their own interests above the people 's , and the people have a right to protest when their voices are not being heard , otherwise it 'd be a dictatorship . 
  the eu acted in the wrong by making this deal secret , it opened the doors to speculations ( and made people assume that it had to have had something bad otherwise it would n't have been secret ) and now you have articles that say the ttip is great and will bring lots of jobs and others that say it will cause problems to our workers/consumers rights and could put at risk the european environmental standards ( i found [ this article ] ( http://one-europe.info/the-transatlantic-trade-and-investment-partnership ) which i think maintains a certain level of neutrality towards the matter ) . 
  it does n't matter , most of the territory still belonged to it and we 're already referred to [ lusitanic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lusitanic ) so it 's not like it would make much of a difference  the most important one ( above douro river ) cheeky bastard , 
   probably because neither parties wanted to rename the whole country from a region it would n't be the country having to rename itself but just one of the regions . 
   one which i suppose was not very large . 
  both regions are/where actually quite big ( the spanish one is an autonomous region and ours was the region that encompassed the metropolitan area of lisbon and its surrounding ) but their names where never considered ambitions of invading the other ( it was just a name ) . 
  we stopped calling it estremadura and now just refer to the area as lisbon ( which includes the lisbon district and the northern part of the set\u00fabal district ) . 
  not so fun fact : both [ portugal ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/estremadura ) and [ spain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extremadura ) have had a region called extremadura/estremadura at the same time ( before we changed it ) , never really caused much of a stir between the two countries . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfvlab4sdhk ), 
  well then that 's good for your state , have they also been releasing the people that were arrested smoking pot ? 
  something simple , like : `` the great and totally relevant republic of lusitania , land of the portuguese , explorers of the seas , producers of cork and wine , and the true western europeans '' or , in it 's shorter version , `` tgatrrollotpeotspocawattwe '' . 
  jokes aside , lusitania is fine . 
  why would you build it out of wood in the first place ? 
  it 's much heavier than aluminium . 
  that 's after a night of drinking with the dutch embassador of eesti . 
  they do have some nice looking furniture ( and some not as nice looking ones ) , but still , i 'd expect something more like [ this ] ( http://media.independent.com/img/croppedphotos/2010/03/12/omafiets-gt-studio_t479.jpg?ad14627618f647f3902aa65ed5ac8237c798b1ef ) for the dutch embassy . 
  you 'd think the dutch would have a better taste in bicycles , this looks like it was bought in ikea . 
  it 's hypocrisy, 
  a lot of police here are usually hostile and biased towards gypsies and blacks . 
  but the majority of cases of police violence do occur in rough neighborhoods and in sports events or in protests , which is something common in many other countries . 
  actually the [ uk 's tories and lib dems are in favor of the ttip ] ( http://www.waronwant.org/media/ttip-and-2015-election-where-do-parties-stand ) so even if you guys leave ( and the tories remain in power ) there 's still a chance of a similar ( or worse ) deal . 
  every time i see an article about someone resigning because of the panama papers that song jumps immediately into my head xd, 
  dammit !, 
  my plan to release criminals into the streets of the us failed but i 'll get you next time , i swear on me mum !, 
  instead of building more prisons or paying for private prisons ( which , by the way , are horrible ) , you guys could enact a ** retroactive ** law decriminalizing marijuana ( that alone could relieve a lot of the overcrowding ) , change your system from punishment to rehabilitation and increase funding in schools ( including funding some courses for adults to help them get back on their feet ) and help poorer communities . 
   but that used to be a very very dangerous neighbourhood , basically a favela , where police could easily get shot if they gave people they approached an opening still is, 
  we know that we have problems with police brutality and prison overcrowding but it never reaches a point where cops start killing people ( like what happens in the us ) and this is quite hypocritical coming from the us , which also has lots of problems with corruption , police brutality and prison overcrowding . 
  [ they also pointed out police brutality and prison overcrowding in portugal ] ( http://observador.pt/2016/04/14/eua-voltam-apontar-condicoes-das-cadeias-abusos-policiais-portugal/ ) ( which , coming from the us , is extremely ~ ~ ironic ~ ~ hypocritical ) . 
  / r/portugal is pretty good ( the users are mostly friendly and helpful towards both portuguese and foreigners ) , as long as politics is n't involved , then it 's a battle zone between the left and right and you 'll become obese with the amount of popcorn you 'll eat while reading the comments . 
   and build a wall around russia and make the russians pay for it . 
  [ ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia%e2%80%93ukraine_barrier ) and [ eesti ^ ^ ^ stronk ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34085926 ) have got you covered , sort of ... ^ ^ ^ russia ^ ^ ^ is n't ^ ^ ^ paying ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ them ... 
  [ it 's a commemorative coin ] ( http://www.coinsweekly.com/en/german-commemorative-coins-with-completely-new-security-technology/4?&amp;id=3410 ) just like the [ belgian 2.5 $ ] ( http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015-belgium-2pt5-euro-waterloo-coin800.jpg ),

  when you say it does n't reduce the cost are you referring to the cost for the people or for the government ? 
  do you think it causes more or less of a strain on the economy than the public healthcare that germany has ( for example ) ? 
  for instance the healthcare system in portugal takes a major chunk out of the country 's economy , would the system that switzerland or nl have help reduce the costs for the government and help increase the quality of the healthcare or would it be more expensive ?

   are they associated with your nation in any way , like the british bulldog and the uk . 
  are they common pets , strictly wild or working animals ? 
  the portuguese water dog is the most popular portuguese dog breed ( both [ bo and sunny ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/sunny_and_bo.jpg ) are portuguese water dogs , for example ) but there is n't much of an association between the portuguese and a specific dog breed ( that i know of ) . 
  they are also a not so common breed and [ require quite a bit of grooming ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_water_dog#coat_types ) , [ they 're working dogs , they 're very intelligent and can be easily trained to help you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_water_dog#temperament ) . 
  [ they have one on the turkish part of the border and are thinking of building one in the greek border too ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-bulgaria-idukkcn0wr0um ) , they also have a tight border control . 
  but you 're not experiencing the same amount of refugees that the southern balkans are so right now it 's quite manageable on your end . 
  only if bulgaria decides to remove their border ~ ~ fence ~ ~ control with greece , which is unlikely . 
  romania joining wo n't affect much , if you are considering the border with ukraine , poland , hungary and slovakia also border ukraine and they have n't had trouble on their side . 
  edit :[ there is n't a fence on the greek-bulgarian border yet ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-bulgaria-idukkcn0wr0um ) ( only in the turkish-bulgarian border ) but there is quite a bit of border policing . 
   that 's why germany decided to do the worst : have both : public + private ... but only the wealthy are allowed to quit the public ... 
  same here , and the government even dumps money to the private system in detriment to the public one . 
   it is like putting the best of both worlds into a system - that 's why it is deamed superior to most other systems . 
  so why are n't there more countries using this system ? 
  question for the swiss , how good is your healthcare system ? 
  you guys have a system closer to the us one ( privatized ) than the one in other european countries ( public ) , right ? 
  does that mean that people also experience the same problems that occurs in the us ( people not being able to afford healthcare ) ? 
  and if not , do you think your system is better ( less of a strain in the economy and better for the hospitals and people , in general ) than the european system ? 
  it 's just the media over exaggerating things like they always do , just nod and keep walking and do n't make eye contact , they 're like jehovah 's witnesses !, 
   but belgium gives no fucks .

   strawberry scooter gang sounds like a gang of hippies or [ angry vegetarians ] ( http://how-i-met-your-mother.wikia.com/wiki/strawberry ),

  well he 's not exactly my first choice , but his government ( i assume ) has managed to turn a former soviet state into a relatively successful country , estonia is growing quite a bit economically , technologically and socially . 
  of the ones currently in government , xavier bettel ( luxembourg ) , mark rutte ( netherlands ) , or taavi r\u00f5ivas ( estonia ) , in that order of preference . 
  no way , that did n't end well for us the last time,

  [ be careful with hola ] ( http://lifehacker.com/hola-better-internet-sells-your-bandwidth-turning-its-1707496872 ) :  hola users ca n't opt out of being an exit node in the free version . 
  the problem with being an exit node , of course , is that ** when someone is connected through you and does something illegal ** or against your isp 's terms of service , ** you could be held accountable ** -- and since hola makes no promises to encrypt your traffic , it carries the same risk that using a service like tor does ( even if that risk is slight . ), 
  if you are willing to pay for a vpn then you could check out [ tunnelbear ] ( https://www.tunnelbear.com/ ) ( they have a free version with 500mb/month which you can use to test if you like it ),

  what 's that supposed to mean ? 
  i have no specific opinion over this because i do n't pay much attention to polish affairs/society , but from what i 've seen they look like the texas of europe ( just replace oil with coal ) , very conservative , very religious and a bit backwards , but this is just a stereotype and i refuse to believe that the entire population is like this . 
  ultimately it varies from people to people and you ca n't generalize it and i wo n't generalize it , to me this is the image/stereotype that is transmited to the world because the media prefers to transmit loud idiots over quiet smart people , effectively dumbing down the population ( and this happens everywhere , not just poland ) so it just makes it seem like the entirety of the population is a bunch of idiots , but i know there are smart progressive people in the country and they have my utmost respect . 
  and in the language ( pronunciation ) of my land ( algarvian ) : `` um\u00ea ovacreft t\u00e1ch\u00ead ` anguias '', 
  yeah , but it 's just something that you do n't hear about , i never knew there was an issue , at least with macedonia ( fyrom ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ kill ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ greeks ) you hear about it because the greeks make their voices heard outside of the area of conflict , with the british isles where is this issue discussed besides ireland and maybe the uk ? 
  just curious , is it something controversial in ireland like macedonia 's name or is it just among a few people ? 
   would you be happy if everybody started describing portugal as being on the spanish peninsula ? 
  i think it 's a bit of a different situation , the iberian peninsula was never called the spanish peninsula so it would n't make sense , it used to be called [ hispania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hispania ) by the romans a long time ago , maybe then , when the regions were broken up and [ lusitania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lusitania ) was formed , some people kept calling the lusitanian people hispanics and it took sometime for people to adapt . 
  i 've never heard of irish people being mad about the name british isles so i assumed it was n't an issue , but if there 's a majority of irish people who defend that the name should change then they should try to make their voices heard , not just locally but globally , otherwise , even if ireland decided to change their name , people from other countries would still keep using british isles because of ignorance to the issue . 
  there 's also cgp grey 's video about the [ differences between the uk , great britain and england ] ( https://youtu.be/rnu8xdbsn10?t=1m10s ) where he also says that the british isles include great britain ireland and the other smaller islands around these two big ones . 
  `` o meu hovercraft est\u00e1 cheio de enguias '' , although there are two portuguese words for hovercraft ( * aerobarco * and * aerodeslizador * ) most people prefer to use the english version,

  hey , merkel finally got her hands unstuck , good for her !, 
   dublin is one of the more expensive cities in the uk this is a joke , right ? 
  that 's why galicia looks like it 's part of portugal in the map, 
  it 's okay , we can just name it [ portugalicia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_portugal ) and use [ this flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/flag_of_portugalicia.svg ) , 
  my guess is we have many tiny villages spread out throughout the region which means more roads and more spread out lights , whereas on the spanish side people tend to gather more in urban centers leaving the country side more empty , again , just my guess, 
  that 's because you belong to us , this map just reinforces it , you guys even subconsciously selected the same lighting as us , great minds think alike and all that , 
  and what sickens me the most is the deal that 's being discussed between the eu and this country , i hope that deal gets a clear rejection, 
  disasters , the only thing missing in cities skylines that would make that game much more entertaining , i remember in sc4 you could spam the map with tornadoes or meteors , those were times , 
  so , is it safe to assume that now he 's just going full on dictator mode ? 
  what 's next ? 
  no more elections ?

   what is important is that all of these actors have power to significantly reduce the problem and they are all parts in the system and they directly or indirectly cause , benefit and take harm from these negative aspects . 
  the only actors here that can make a difference are the consumers , while they continue to choose to buy these products , companies that provide them will benefit and companies that do n't provide them will lose business . 
   the uk for the last decade has been told we can not deport terrorists who are n't even british or eu citizens for a start . 
  sauce please ? 
   we 've been told how many hours we can work . 
  sauce and did n't you already have in the past an 8/hours a day limit ? 
   what legitimacy does this decree have ? 
  it has the full backing of the eu parliament which the uk voluntary agreed to recognize as legitimate . 
   how do you feel about the [ serbian pentagon ] ( http://x.vukajlija.com/var/products/posters/201108/207719/srpski.jpg ) ? 
  that looks delicious . 
   while it makes economic sense ( i.e. 
  it is profitable to sell to belarus ) products will be sent to belarus no matter what . 
  of course , unless someone embargoes belarus , they 'll still be able to acquire their products elsewhere . 
   instead of exporting 100 items , 130 will be produced . 
  that takes time and resources and those extra 30 units might still be exported to the eu :p you have to look at the actual data to get a good picture . 
   it can be painful for belarussians if eu will provide more competition to their products so that instead of purgasing belarussian-made goods , ukraine will purchase european-made . 
  but then this will mean that ukraine is able to spend resources more efficiently . 
  which is a good thing , both ukraine and the eu benefit and it gives an incentive for belarus to improve . 
  governments , private businesses , consumers and voters all have a share of responsibility for these issues . 
  the government , private businesses and voters , none of these can force you to buy these . 
  the only one to blame are the consumers who are willing to buy these products knowing full well the conditions under which they were made . 
   well since this is a british newspaper , most british people care , unsurprisingly . 
  i was only talking about  the rest of us europeans, 
   over here we have to respect civil rights , worker rights , family rights , manufacturing rights , producer/creative/copyrights , etc. 
  and still we get swamped by stuff made abroad by countries that respect nothing , commit atrocities of all sorts against its peoples and environment . 
  you 're right . 
   and all because ? 
  ~ ~ big fat corporations and a globalized banking sector that 's making a killing over the stupidity of eu citizens and by owning the media , the majority of politicians and with it the entire legislative process . 
  even the institutions created to protect the eu are failing miserably , corrupted by greedy bastards . ~ ~ ( big fat corrupt greedy bastards ) consumers prefer to buy those goods which are cheaper . 
  ftfy . 
   bastiat explains this much better than i ever could . 
  nice . 
  x ) oh , tugasnake , if you ever have the time , [ here ] ( http://www.econlib.org/library/smith/smwn.html ) , this is also great . 
   it will not hurt their economy at all . 
  or it should not . 
  if ukraine exports 100 of something where 50 % go to belarus and 50 % go to the eu and the eu reduces its tariffs to ukraine , suddenly ukraine will be able to and will benefit more to export more to the eu , meaning that out of those 100 they produce and export , more will be sold in the eu and , as a consequence , less on belarus . 
   eu is a joke - a failing , rotting institution , which only exploits slavs and treats them as second class citizens . 
  yeah , just the other day they told eastern europe to sit in the back of the bus . 
  lol, 
  why should we care if it will thrive or not ? 
  the rest of us europeans must only care about if they are in or not and what it will mean for us if they abandon the eu . 
  the outcome for them if they do decide to leave is their own problem and i 'm sure they 'll sort themselves out just fine without our help . 
  what 's so wrong about european legislation anyway ? 
  it 's those damned bendy bananas ( which is n't even true ) , is n't it ? 
   which is exactly why uk must leave the eu because you 've trolled the eu enough ? 
   what issue ? 
  are you asking me why i think it 's idiotic ? 
  our gun laws , yes , i do n't even know how they are as it 's such not an issue here , i was asking for a more detailed opinion on them because i honestly do n't know , 
   others provided valuable insight into a community i 'm yet to meet one who is like this . 
  so far , no such luck , they 've all be downright unpleasant to be around , to put it lightly . 
   he solution is easy : forbid not only buying guns but having them , and force people to destroy them . 
  that would be just effective as their war on drugs . 
   i 'd rather have the american law regarding guns than the idiotic law we have here in portugal . 
  what is our law regarding this issue ? 
   i 'm fucking glad that i live in a country where the only guns i see are carried by the police or the military and where collecting guns is not simply an extravagant hobby but raises eyebrows . 
  does n't switzerland have one of the highest number of guns per capita in the world ? 
  i 'm basing my info on [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_politics_in_switzerland ) , so i might be wrong though . 
   and germany , france , italy and spain do n't do the same thing ? 
  no , they do n't . 
  damn , that was sad . 
  hey ztiller , what 's that fucking pie doing next to your username ? 
  [ wait a second , it 's your birthday ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=5qm8ph4xass#t=45s ) !, 
   that is so racist . 
  why ca n't the borders just be open ?!, 
  yet more blood on white mans hands . 
  those people had families and friends and because of racism they now are in deep grief !, 
  dude , that is fucked up , while you 're right in that you ca n't just open the borders and let numberless people who have completely different cultures into on our welfare states , but on the other hand , they risked everything to get here and they drowned while crossing the med . . put yourself in their shoes , your only crime would be to have been born in a fucked up place , nobody deserves this . 
   from what i 've seen though , there 's really no other way to get our point across as all our supporters are small countries compared to france/germany that 's nonsense , you could easily get ireland , the nordics and most of the former soviet countries to back you up against the french policies like cap . 
  nothing is stopping you from trying to change the measures being proposed and instead attempt to create an union based more on free trade as opposed to interventionism and state capitalism , you do could provide a massive and necessary counter-weight to the french interests but you choose not to an instead alienate yourself from the eu , which in unfortunate , that course of action is impossible to defend and is also highly ineffective . 
  though i guess i kinda understand , the murdoch empire has been working relentlessly for decades to distance the uk from the eu and your political leaders have to comply with their demands or they 'll suffer the same fate and be criticised non-stop in your media . 
  i know it 's more complicated than this but you have to understand - it 's sad that you 're taking that course of action , of giving up on the eu , you seem to be more inclined to leave than to change things to the way you think would be best - and this is harmful not only to your relationship with europe , it 's also quite bad for europe as a whole . 
   you sound like abit of a troll yourself . 
   i kinda am but not in full time . . it gets boring if you always do the same thing . 
  it 's not that you 're stopping the eu but that you 're delaying it , and it 's true , in most negotiations the uk always threatens to veto and stalls things till they get an opt-out clause or something similar . 
  do n't get me wrong , i mostly agree with the british proposals as opposed to the french who want more and more government intervention in the economy , but the uk always opting out instead of trying to get their measures implemented on a eu level , always trying to negotiate from the outside and shunning every attempt at further integration as if it were the plague . . that is too much , as much as a lot of the rest of us agrees with you , the way in which you try to achieve those goals ca n't be supported , that and the constant `` we 'll leave if we do n't get what we want , you european bastards '' , it makes standing up for you very difficult . 
  oh , look , another thread which will get srs and all the trolls in here . 
   i 'm serious . 
  try all you want , you ca n't argue against scientific data , global warming is n't just a socialist conspiracy so that the commies get to close down all the factory and get us to back to living in their pre-industrial utopia . 
  nah , man , sorry , i ca n't take you for real , you must be a lousy troll . 
  nobody is against the uk revising their position within the eu , what people are getting upset with is the constant sitting in the fence , the only partial commitment and the whole `` we 're special and have special needs '' the british are always going on about . 
  please stop this at once , just have your referendum and either make a true commitment or leave , nobody will think any less of you regardless of the outcome , what we all want is for you to make up your mind so we can stop with this bickering and actually start solving our problems . 
   kyoto is socialism by the back door , attached to the idea ( which is widely disputed ) that humans are causing global warming . 
  i honestly hope you 're just trolling .

   which has nothing to do with my post above . 
  or with any possible solution to the problem of corporations not being taxed , which could be solved in 1000 different ways .

   you are just trolling me from post to post . 
  `` here is one of them commies , do n't trust them '' i ca n't help it , the shit you post is too crazy for me to let it slide . 
   grow up .

  merkel ( and germany by extension ) as the flag bearer of austerity , objectively has part of the blame . 
  this is n't just some silly need to blame someone . 
  of course lots of other people/countries have it too , namely , our own politicians . 
  for that kind of visit , i 'd recommend coming with warmer weather so you can enjoy the outdoor terraces . 
  if you 're coming during the winter the area does n't matter as much as there are good restaurants scattered all over lisbon . 
  anyway , my recommendation would be . 
  during the day , you can head to bel\u00e9m and eat some [ nice pastries ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pastel_de_nata ) and coffee while you look at the [ jer\u00f3nimos monastery ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:jer%c3%b3nimos_april_2009-4.jpg ) . 
  during the night , go downtown where if you 're a bit careful you can have a good dinner avoiding the tourist traps and still see some pretty stuff from outside ( you can try pin\u00f3quio in avenida da liberdade ) . 
  after dinner walk until [ terreiro do pa\u00e7o ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pra%c3%a7a_do_com%c3%a9rcio ) where a new disco opened . 
  take a look around because it 's fucking pretty , then decide if you want the disco there or go to the bars in the nearby cais do sodr\u00e9 before going to some other disco . 
  the night ends very late in lisbon so there 's no hurry , go to the cais do sodr\u00e9 bars then decide . 
  i 've tried to balance good eating , seeing stuff without actually going into a museum , and a proper end of day drunkenness . 
  but this is just one day , you can really do a lot of other stuff , maybe other portuguese wo n't mind planning your other days . 
  the annoying thing to me is that she seems to be implying that the 25 % of gdp and 50 % social spending are related in a 1:1 ratio or something . 
  the rest of the world does not do enough social spending that 's why they are shitholes and we have 50 % of it . 
  these 2 percentages are not comparable at all . 
  just because 2 things are a percentage it does n't mean they are in the same unit . 
  i find this comparison intellectually extremely dishonest . 
  i think he was asking for specific places . 
  let me suggest a few : - [ praia da cordoama ] ( http://www.minube.pt/fotos/sitio-preferido/8421/41051 ) - [ serra do ger\u00eas ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=serra+do+ger%c3%aas&amp;hl=pt-pt&amp;tbo=u&amp;rlz=1c1svea_pt-ptpt485pt485&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=nedpunkcl8ithgef9yhobq&amp;ved=0ce4qsaq&amp;biw=1241&amp;bih=606 ) - [ the staircase of the church in lamego ] ( http://imgur.com/1t1hr ) - [ the lello e irm\u00e3o bookshop in porto ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=lello+e+irm%c3%a3os+porto&amp;hl=pt-pt&amp;tbo=u&amp;rlz=1c1svea_pt-ptpt485pt485&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=nkhpulynpmwihqejjycgaw&amp;ved=0cegqsaq&amp;biw=1241&amp;bih=606#hl=pt-pt&amp;tbo=d&amp;rlz=1c1svea_pt-ptpt485pt485&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=lello+e+irm%c3%a3o+porto&amp;oq=lello+e+irm%c3%a3o+porto&amp;gs_l=img.3...1478.1478.0.1684.1.1.0.0.0.0.55.55.1.1.0...0.0...1c.1.ynwqzzdfgwg&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.1355325884,d.zg4&amp;fp=9030d40036ac9518&amp;bpcl=39967673&amp;biw=1241&amp;bih=606 ) these are a very small sample , i could be suggesting stuff for months . 
  i honestly think portugal is one of the most underrated tourist destinations . 
  i disagree as they also have an influence on the other users . 
  do we want to create a pleasant environment where things can be discussed rationally or do we want a sub where people are constantly trolled and harassed ? 
  i 'm all for freedom of speech but any `` in real life '' public forum would not tolerate the constant trolling we see here . 
  this subreddit is starting to suffer from the effect where people behave like trolls because they see lots of other trolls around instead of carefully constructed posts . 
  problem is not solved because they keep trolling all threads . 
  i do n't think it 's that big a deal anyway but it is certainly * annoying * that we have a troll comment in every single submission on / r/europe . 
  there 's no need to be sarcastic . 
  it is perfectly possible to express yourself normally and get your point across . 
  i agree with you for normal posts , but constant trolls should just be banned . 
  i 've seen very different statistics for this . 
  this map is based just on prof. lynn study , and iq is pretty much bullshit anyway . 
  this is also the dude who said men are more intelligent than women by 5 iq points so i do n't think he 's very credible and that his studies are unbiased . 
  he seems to favor whatever group he 's part of as can be seen by the relatively high uk iq result , which is hilarious in my opinion . 
  it has nothing to do with that , these people are constantly trolling and it 's annoying and disrupts this sub . 
  ^ pickpocket, 
  i think we all do this , only silly americans think it is ok to use only the fork . 
  we do cook it in one piece but i 've never seen anyone using a plate to break it up . 
  agreed . 
  it also seems to have the perfect shape to get the coffee cold way too fast . 
  it 's pretty much the same situation . 
  spain has a series of small regional savings banks . 
  in portugal and spain many small banks and even some bigger ones have `` caixa '' in their names . 
  in spain these small banks were a huge part of the housing bubble they experienced . 
  case in point , portugal which is similar to spain in many aspects , mostly does n't have small regional savings banks and experienced only a very small housing bubble . 
  so it is not ** one ** corrupt as fuck bank , but a series of small banks not being regulated enough and trying to maximize their profits with little foresight . 
  so i see a very big parallel with the german situation . 
   but leaves most of germany 's retail banking sector -- and its politically powerful network of savings banks ah , germans want to have the possibility of doing their version of the spanish caixas ... 
  this is stupid . 
  have n't seen it . 
  a co-worker recommended it to me a few weeks ago and now it 's referenced on reddit . 
  i guess it 's time to see it and i can see how that quote fits in the mentality they portray in the movie . 
  i still stand by my point of course , many people literally believe that quote . 
  [ this is all i can think about right now ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddai8ff3f4&amp;t=10s ), 
  i do n't know why you were downvoted , that 's a point of view . 
  i quite disagree with it , but it 's a valid contribution to this discussion ; again i remind / r/europe of the [ reddiquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette ) . 
  in this comment you seem like a free market fundamentalist . 
  in my opinion , people thankfully do not behave like the horrible `` rational agents '' those guys have in their models , and much if not most of human endeavors and progress has not came out of greed . 
  of course you will then argue that they always have some kind of greed , greed for feeling good about themselves , or something . 
  that must be the kind of greed that makes me give coins to beggars when i 'm stopped on traffic lights alone in my car and no one but me will know about my good deed . 
  i do n't think that 's what is really happening . 
  people have a lot more motivating them than greed and it is horribly reductionist to put everything trough the greed looking glass . 
  i totally used to agree with you , but frankly as the economic crisis unfurled and i watched the incompetence of eu institutions , the lack of solidarity between europeans from different countries , the management of a common currency only in the interest of few , and the constant lies fed to europeans by the commission , the ecb and the various european leaders . 
  i 'm very much starting to doubt that . 
  furthermore , the eu future is objectively weak . 
  while the eurozone does n't break the negative feedback loop it got itself into , no one with close economic ties to the eurozone will be doing well . 
  i see no signs that the eurozone will start doing the right thing anytime soon . 
  it does n't have catalytic converter !, 
  because the eu future is n't weak ? 
  eheheheh dude i did say . 
   that said , some of these answers can probably be attributed to people being nervous of being asked questions by someone with a camera , and just saying the first thing that comes to mind . 
  so i agree with you , but plenty of them said things like `` oh i do n't know about that stuff '' , which i interpret as `` i 'm not even going to use my brain to think about it '' . 
  i think there are a few more culprits like the other countries that stubbornly still demand austerity when it has already shown it is not working , or even the european comission - barroso recently had the nerve to say , while smiling , that austerity is working in an interview in portugal when all the portuguese know it is not ; or the ecb that still says that europe will be growing by the end of 2013 when it is obvious that it wont . 
  in my opinion the incompetence is widespread across europe and that is the problem . 
  the germans must be pissed off too , they made the latest patchwork job on greece thinking it would delay further problems until after their elections . 
  boy were they wrong . 
  anyway i get confused when i ca n't understand if you 're trolling or being serious . 
  berlusconi 's party withdrew it 's support so he really did n't have democratic legitimacy anymore . 
  i 'm not sure that 's an excuse . 
  many of them did n't even try to use their brain . 
  you can see the cogs turning into the right answer in the young girl and old dude that got it right . 
  i excuse the guy that answered as if we were speaking about planets as the original question does n't make any sense due to how obvious the answer is . 
  frankly , this video annoys me , it shows that many people have not only conformed themselves with being ignorant , they are also ok with not using their brain and not trying to understand what is being told to them . 
  that said , some of these answers can probably be attributed to people being nervous of being asked questions by someone with a camera , and just saying the first thing that comes to mind . 
  of course what ben9345 suggested is not even an option , but your answer to it is the argument blocking any solution to the eurozone crisis . 
  ah the european problem in one sentence . 
  i do n't think there 's any particular `` hate on her '' over here , we just did n't elect her and think the current eurozone policies are counterproductive if not outright suicidal . 
  you are right , of course , she 's certainly not the only culprit for austerity being the route europe has taken . 
  true , portuguezer is not happy with that . 
  you certainly have your tribal instincts quite well developed . 
  i know that redditor generation has n't experienced war unless they 're a ptsd american , but dude ... not cool . 
  not long after that we were helping with the 1st world war so clearly we got over it . 
  it certainly is true that it was a big deal for us at the time though . 
  we have plenty of africans here from our former colonies and we do n't seem to have this problem . 
  to be fair , they 're not north africans so maybe the problem lies in the differences in culture between north africans and angolans , mozambicans , cape verdeans , etc. 
  and between the receiving country culture and the culture of portugal . 
  we do lots of things wrong here ( finances ) , but there is also some good stuff that other europeans can learn from us , and analyzing the differences can be worth it . 
  this saddens me and would sadden most portuguese if it is seriously going to happen . 
  the uk is a country the portuguese quite like and we see it as a friend and one of our [ oldest allies ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-portuguese_alliance ) . 
  the european union is certainly better with the british aboard from my perspective .

  they will have to choose . 
  there will have to be a bureaucratic process , and that process will be anything but simple ( and judging from my previous experiences with swiss bureaucracy , at least in the french canton , i can only react with a ` lol ' ) . 
   are you really suggesting that one of the freest , most developed , progressive , wealthy and truly beautiful countries is going to struggle to recruit or to attract people to meet quotas ? 
  attract ? 
  recruit ? 
  yes . 
  exactly . 
  competing industries in other eu countries now have more ease to recruit people for their companies than swiss companies . 
  my point is the same . 
  how do you enforce the quota ? 
   or they 'll just negotiate an associate agreement as replacement , continue trading with the single market , but now set their own immigration limits . 
  obviously , but it takes two to tango . 
   why on earth would they have problems getting qualified workers ? 
  they 'll be able to just run an advert . 
  they can invite as many or as little as they like . 
  the immigration limits the swiss have just voted for ? 
  they 'll still get qualified individuals through exceptions , sure , but they just added a layer of bureaucracy , making it inherently harder to go work there . 
  haha , what a snub . 
  well this is anecdotal , but i went to the u.k. in 2008 and i only took my id card . 
  [ more info ] ( http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/customs-travel/enteringtheuk/arrivingatukborder/ )  what travel documents are accepted at the border ? 
  you must be the legal holder of a genuine document . 
  your documents must be valid and issued by a government or authority . 
  the most common examples of travel documents are :  national passports ; or 1951 convention travel documents for refugees . 
  ** we also accept national identity cards for eea citizens . 
  eh it was just a retarded joke , not a criticism of current european union foreign policy . 
  to be honest , i 'm far more afraid of russian economic sanctions and the clusterfuck that crimea is , rather than military intervention . 
  the use of military force by any side right now would be extremely unwise . 
  russia invading ukraine ? 
  time to sharpen our pencils and refill our pens . 
  on a more serious note :  analysts say that although russia has a special interest in ukraine , glazyev does not speak for putin and is exaggerating the threat of military force . 
   `` mr. glazyev has a record of making inflammatory statements about ukraine -- to my knowledge , he does not speak for the russian government on ukraine , '' said john lough , an analyst specializing on the russia and eurasia at the chatham house think-tank in london . 
  `` i think that any potential intervention by russia would be political and economic , and certainly not military . '', 
   some protesters say the ukrainian government is playing for time and would welcome russian military intervention if protesters refuse to back down . 
  you must have been hibernating then . 
  thanks man !, 
  i really missed the mark there . 
   we 're japans foot in the eu door , are n't we ? 
  can someone explain this analogy to me ? 
  i do n't really get it . 
  is it about quantitative easing ? 
  and you know this , how ? 
   and yet all of you idiots are eating it up . 
  again . 
  wake up sheeple !, 
   back to the halcyon days where we only complained about evil america ( with the uk sometimes getting an honorary mention ) , eh ? 
  oh yes , everyone bullies the poor usa and uk . 
  nasties like germany and france , with their massive and far greater military and intelligence spending pose a real threat to the five-eyes coalition . 
  they 're bullies / u/yldas . 
  always preying on the poor , old and kind , uncle sam . 
  pushing their luck . 
  they are trying to kill you , destroy your way of life . 
  you must continue your work . 
  awaken the sheepish europeans to their devilish governments . 
  let them see the truth only you can see !, 
  let them bathe in the eternal glory of your unique perspective !, 
   i did not say that foreigners are outlawed from society . 
  neither did i. 
   i 'd try my best to be a part of a society and for me this means also getting a citizenship . 
  why is citizenship ** that ** important to you ? 
  oh , the portuguese state also lets you live in guettos ( offers utilities too ) and get the benefits . 
  when i meant dignified , i meant a place where leaving the building does n't mean getting mugged and beaten to a pulp . 
  300 and something euros is not nearly enough to live a comfortable life in portugal , even with house and utilities paid , much less in germany . 
   i 'd fully become a part of its society ( citizenship ) this is wrong . 
  on so many levels . 
  think about it deeply . 
  citizenship is ( should be ) a completely independent thing from society . 
  what ? 
  it is pretty hard to make do being hartz iv . 
  of course they 're not easy , but if you are legally here you are as entitled to them as i am . 
   most of these benefits are shit meaning they 're low and that is is pretty much impossible to lead a dignified life ( food , housing and utilities ) with them . 
   if i move to another country to earn more money it 's my own decision and i do not necessarily have the right to claim the same benefits there as a foreigner . 
  if you paid taxes and social security , would n't you feel entitled to claim benefits ? 
  i mean how would you have a retirement pension then ? 
  does the german government offer you a pension if you never paid ss before ? 
  because in portugal they would tell me to fuck off ( i.e. 
  : pay me 230 $ / month ) . 
  necessary criteria for all below : you need to have a social security number , to have one , you need to either have a residence permit , or be an eu citizen with residence in portugal ( hint : it 's not hard ) . 
  edit : ( the other obvious option is : be a citizen ) unemployment benefits : if you 're unemployed you need to be actively searching for work and show up to any interviews your unemployment counselor sets . 
  you also need to have worked before for at least 6 months , or else you 're not counted as unemployed and therefore you are not entitled to unemployment benefits . 
  family benefits : you need to have children or dependent minors . 
  sickness : you need to be sick . 
  disability : you need to be disabled or have a dependent person that is . 
  poor : you need to have an income under a certain amount . 
  modifiers include : marital status , number of children , number of dependents , income bracket and others that i do n't recall right now . 
  there are several others , including some for illegal aliens , but i do n't know and cba to look for them in the social security website . 
  be aware that most of these benefits are shit . 
  edit : i forgot the main one , ha . 
  pensions : you need to have discounted to social security for a number of years ( 15 consequent years if i 'm not mistaken ) and from the total you discounted a monthly value is given and calculated from several criteria . 
  if you either : have a value that 's bellow a certain threshold or are not entitled to any pensions , you can have a special survival pension of something like 230 $ / month . 
   btw how is this topic handled in portugal ? 
  quoting my previous post :  i mean in portugal , if you have a residence permit ( or are an eu citizen ) you can enjoy state pension and state benefits as long as you fulfill the same criteria as other portuguese ( being a citizen is not one of them ) . 
  i thought this was pretty much the same across europe . 
  i was wrong apparently . 
  edit :  i did , the main reason for working in germany is probably a higher wage than what you get in your home country . 
  so you 're not in germany to help or finance society , but to earn more money and sustain a higher standard of living . 
  i hope this answers your question . 
  no it does n't . 
  it is completely ridiculous . 
  this part is hilarious :  but to earn more money and sustain a higher standard of living . 
  so germans are n't looking for that ?

  seriously guys , it 's getting scary .

  truly a good day !, 
  next time a brit rants about the unelected bureaucrats of the eu i 'll show him this . 
  i know that the eu parliament has an ** official ** subreddit / r/europeanparliament probably managed by interns , though . 
   frequently asked questions in a major diplomatic victory for the uae , emiratis will need only a valid passport to enter any of the schengen countries . 
  the uae is the first arab country , second in the middle east , and third among islamic countries whose citizens receive this visa waiver . 
  here are some of faqs on visa-free travel for emiratis to schengen countries . 
  ** q : when does visa-free travel for emiratis start ? 
  ** from may 7 , uae nationals can visit 34 european countries without obtaining a visa prior to the travel date . 
  ** q : what does the visa-free travel to europe mean for emiratis ? 
  ** it means an emirati traveller needs only to produce a valild passport at the host country 's airport . 
  he will then be allowed to stay for 90 uninterrupted days , or 6 months with interruption . 
  ** q : when was the visa-free travel for emiratis granted by the eu ? 
  ** the proposal to grant the uae schengen visa-free status was passed by the european parliament in june 2014 , with 523 out of 577 votes . 
  ** q : how many flight are there between the uae and europe ? 
  ** there are 500 airline trips a week between the uae and eu and these figures will most likely increase as travel restrictions are lifted . 
  several thousand emiratis visit europe throughout the year . 
  last year , italy alone granted about 10,000 visas for emiratis at both their abu dhabi and dubai diplomatic mission out of the 35,000 visas approved in the uae . 
  with the visa-waiver , the number of emirati tourists to europe is expected to increase dramatically . 
  ** q : which european countries will uae citizens be allowed visa-free travel ? 
  ** uae citizens will be allowed access to 34 european countries ( including 28 schengen states ) . 
  the schengen area member states are : austria , belgium , czech republic , denmark , estonia , finland , france , germany , greece , hungary , iceland ( not an eu state ) , italy , latvia , liechtenstein ( not a european union member state ) , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , netherlands , norway ( not an eu member state ) , poland , portugal , slovakia , slovenia , spain , sweden and switzerland ( not a eu state ) . 
  ** q : what happens in emergencies ? 
  ** citizens need to coordinate with the uae missions in these countries to negotiate longer stays . 
  ** q : what if an emirati citizen is accompanied by non-emiratis ? 
  ** if you are accompanied by non-emirati citizens , make sure to obtain a schengen visa for them before travelling . 
  ** q : how big is the trade been the uae and eu states ? 
  ** based on eu data , trade between the 28 members of the eu states and the uae rose in 2012 by 9.7 per cent year-on-year and hit $ 45.4 billion . 
  trade connections with european countries today is tipping the $ 50 billion ( dh205 billion ) point .

  when ? 
   you 're obviously caught up in some kind of delusional anti- ` communist ' fervour , where here the word communist is used to mean anything you disagree with . 
  not really , you were the one that commented on `` the ` law of the jungle ' style of governance is going the way of the dodo '' and i mentioned that was precisely the case with communism , which is based upon public ownership and strives for a moneyless society - which is exactly what you were arguing for in supporting this proposal and even going as far as saying that it 's `` primitive and degrading ( ... ) to charge people '' . 
   you would actually need to heavily regulate to make it into a functioning market , but that would be even more expensive than just letting local governments run the show . 
  how so ? 
  i 've never heard of a situation where goods and services were actually cheaper when provided by the government , just because it might be cheaper for the consumer it does n't mean it will be cheaper for society . 
   exactly . 
  railroad privatization has turned out to be a disaster everywhere it was tried . 
  quite the opposite , railroads were first privately owned and only then nationalised , they were much better managed and competitive back then till the state intervened and restricted the business . 
   in germany , they wanted to privatize railroad for the past 20 years and have n't been able to figure out a way to do it without destroying it . 
  you might be right but for the wrong reasons . 
  railroads today are much more unprofitable , specially in germany with the autobahn . 
   water is better run publicly . 
  how ? 
   run it by local governments . 
  if they fuck up , the mayor gets kicked out in the next elections and the local managers get heat from their neighbors . 
  oh , that does sound more appealing , here it is pretty much all done from some office in lisbon . 
  still , between having a limited choice with regards to the mayor or having a limited choice about the supplier , i still believe it would be best for each and every customer to choose for themselves . 
   the local water companies should be normal companies with public books , thy should just be owned by local governments . 
  that was n't the case here . 
   but you should also asking yourself this question . 
  i already did , i see no benefit with nationalisation and i see people more accountable in the private sector . 
   guys ... http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette it 's alright , i find karma wholly irrelevant , i do n't think i should refrain from giving my honest opinion just because it 's somewhat controversial and unorthodox :p, 
   what is it then ? 
  a mirage . 
   you pretty much just described why europe is in trouble . 
  7 % of earths population , 50 % of the welfare spending . 
  the way you 're talking , it 's as if europe was not the best continent there is . 
  there might be problems but let 's get a sense of proportion here . 
   you really like throwing that word around , do n't you ? 
  hey , i 'm not the one who wants common ownership , and that 's textbook communism . 
   law of the jungle refers to an ` every man for himself ' mentality . 
  i 'd say our society is more like `` every person for its family '' but yeah , it 's about that . 
  what , you care more about me or op or some other stranger more than you care about yourself ? 
   water is essentially a monopoly as it is . 
  you 'll generally have one , maybe two if you 're lucky , providers in one area . 
  you 're right , though i wonder , how is the solution for a private monopoly a state monopoly ? 
  seems to me you 're not fixing anything at all !, 
   the idea behind managing it publicly is simply the next logical step in a long process stretching back for decades ( in the netherlands public water management dates back to the 13th century ) . 
  hey , if it works , i 'll have no problems with it , my issue is how people think it will somehow be done better if done by the government , that `` public = good , private = bad '' . 
   are you be opposed to government regulations on water quality ? 
  why should the government need to regulate water quality ? 
  the providers and the consumers already have all the incentives to have the best water quality possible , if the providers slack on this they 'll lose all consumers and will probably be criminally prosecuted in case somebody gets sick . 
  same thing with food actually , and you do n't see people getting food poisoning every time they go to the restaurant or buy food in the supermarket . 
   you might as well be . 
  if the government does n't have the right to ensure their citizens have untethered access to the most important substance on earth then why would they have the right to say it has to be filtered and treated ? 
  why are you putting words in my mouth , going full straw-man and talking as if i was some sort of bogeyman ? 
   it 's not about what 's ` the most cost effective ' . 
  eventually we 'll look back and realise how primitive and degrading it really is to charge people for it . 
  we should n't charge people for water ? 
  tell me , who will work for free then ? 
  where will you get the pipes and the engineers and all the rest of the infrastructure and manpower required for keeping a water company working come from ? 
   the market is highly opaque and physically restricted . 
  blame the government for restricting access and holding a monopoly there in the first place . 
  canalised water is just like the railroads , the only reason those are inefficient monopolies today was because the state stepped in , regulated everything and eventually nationalised . 
   it 's basically not possible to develop a real market , so there will not be any real competition ever , only an oligopoly , and hence there will be inflated prices and a decline in quality . 
  same thing if the state manages it , the only difference is that the costs are hidden for you , they 're paid also through taxes . 
   free markets are good and i am always defending them . 
  but before jumping on a privatization train , ask yourself if there is a chance for a free market to actually develop . 
  and before jumping on a nationalisation train , ask yourself if there is a chance that society will actually benefit from this . 
  because it seems to me a lot of people here are expect a free lunch by the government , that they wo n't all pay just the same or even more . 
   same goes for health care , no free market will ever work , because there is no transparency . 
  the us has the freest of all health care markets and prices usually above 250 % of the prices elsewhere . 
  i wonder how much of their taxes go to healthcare as opposed to ours . 
  though that 's an whole other discussion , i 'm never going to support the us 's stance towards healthcare because of how their government says they act in favour of a free market and competition but actually just helps the health providers that already exist against the customers and new competition , it 's basically a corporatism system , socialism upside down , the complete opposite of a free market . 
   who are you referring to ? 
  when he said `` humans can survive for a few days without water '' , as if we should nationalise something just because it is relatively more important , as if the state could manage it better than the private sector . 
   from what i understand in the past privatized water has meant higher prices without any investments in the essential infrastructure . 
  people and society should only invest in what 's worthwhile , what , you think it would be a good idea to invest in pipes everywhere even if people were n't using those ? 
  that the government should give away millions of euros of the taxpayers money to the benefit of the few like those who lobby the government and get to build that ? 
   the private owners would just seek rent for all the pipes and what not , that were already there and let maintenance slide . 
  and the taxpayers would get what they pay for , and they 'd be paying much less as the government would no longer need to levy taxes to pay for the people for infrastructure they do n't seem to need . 
   slowly degrading the network and in the end costing the people more than was ever made by selling the water company to private owners . 
  it 's not about the benefit of selling to the private owners , it 's about how these manage the system while paying much closer attention to the costs than the state ever does . 
  if the network degrades , the private sector will have to pay for it . 
  if it was the state , it may or may not degrade but it will surely be much more expensive as it 's indifferent for bureaucrat if he manages to cut costs or not , the taxpayers will pay for all his inefficiencies . 
   humans can survive for a few days without water . 
  it may feel like you ca n't live without internet , but it 's a different situation entirely . 
  i mentioned internet because a few days ago there were people here calling for the nationalisation of the web providers . 
  regardless of what you use your water for and how important it is , the way you talk it 's as if people would die of thirst if the water was privately-owned and we 'd all have plentiful if the state managed it instead - that 's absolute nonsense . 
   countries profit when they invest in their citizens ' welfare . 
  you 're right , and nationalising water would be to invest against the welfare of the citizens as the service is the same but it 's more costly and wasteful to manage it publicly . 
   the ` law of the jungle ' style of governance is going the way of the dodo , and rightfully so . 
  law of the jungle ? 
  as in everything belongs to everybody ? 
  thankfully it is becoming extinct , that 's precisely the reason why we should n't go back to the times of common ownership the communists tried so hard to make it work ( and failed so hard they 're still recovering even after all these years ) . 
   water is a natural monopoly . 
  some of the things you mentioned are n't . 
  think about that . 
  i do n't think that 's the case , some consumers have several providers ( like buying portuguese or spanish water if one leaves near the border ) and some even have their own source of water ( like wells ) . 
  also , there 's the distinction of canalised water and bottled water , they 're both water but i really do n't know if this proposal makes the distinction and only wants to nationalise the first one or if it wants to nationalise both . 
  regardless of water being a natural monopoly or not , the solution to that would be to impose a maximum price ( to make the cost for the consumer about the same as the cost for the producer ) , not to leave the monopoly to be held by the government and not by a private entity ( as if these would ever manage it better ) . 
  i mean , what the heck , it 's much more easy to complain with and get a good service even from a privately-owned monopolist than it is to get the same from a state-owned one . 
  nationalising water would do us no good . 
   i dunno , sometimes i wonder where all the old chinese people in portugal go to ... 
  i wonder why dogs tend to avoid them . 
   and with terminating nuclear power , and now no fracking , all the coal they 're going to have to burn instead is going to make global warming all that more pronounced . 
  are n't there economically viable clean sources of energy ? 
   supports free trade and progression of further globalization which is great but is in direct conflict with this :  supports agricultural subsidies because food security is important issue , links to national security , thus allied with france and other southern european countries if it secures protection of finnish farming that 's against free trade , in fact cap ( and cfp as well ) must be the most protectionist policies the eu has . 
   god , you 're probably studying politics too .

  last time i checked , the people in government and the people running businesses where not reptilians , they were people that got elected or that started their own business or rose through the ranks of their companies , saying we need to take those back makes just as much sense and me breaking into my own house . 
   when the unions have amassed enough people it can start to take the funktions that the state and free market had previously . 
  yeah , call me a counter-revolutionary but that 's not going to happen . 
  fine , feel free to take away power from the state , they really should n't be interfering with the market anyway , they most they should do is force people to internalise their externalities and they 've gone way past that . 
  but to take away power from the free market ? 
  that 's quite hilarious , if you do n't want to deal with it , do n't , it does n't force you , cultivate your own food and live off the land , tell the butcher and the baker to go fuck themselves , you do n't need to deal with them , after all , it 's a free market , you only take a part in it if you voluntarily agree to it . 
   the system pacioli invented is still used for recording financial transactions today , hence the hate . 
  what did he invent , the debits and credits in t ? 
  if you do n't mind me asking xd, 
   i mean , today in spain , they 're protesting because ibera is laying off 3k people they should lay off even more people then . 
  [ this is how you should handle the unions ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/professional_air_traffic_controllers_organization_%281968%29 ) . 
   no , it wo n't ` work ' . 
  no , it will work . 
  it wo n't work for good , it will work like the rest of the taxes , but it will work . 
   i have to say that i do n't think this is valid for the new generations . 
  they are , like many start-ups nowadays , born global . 
  hence they present different characteristics . 
  hey , it 's not like we can escape the every day reality and the constant whining . 
  did you see anthony bourdain 's show in lisbon ? 
  holy fucking shit , i nearly hanged myself from how depressing the whole thing was , brazil has it much worse than we do and yet they know how to have a good time !, 
  i really do n't understand , all the older people tell us is how we 're so spoiled , how they lived in misery and the future was so grim and there was n't food available for all , and now that that 's all gone , people still act fucking depressed all the time , i bet malnourished kids in africa often have more fun than a lot of us do . 
   while nobody denies that there was a lot of bad in salazar 's regime , a lot of people accept that at least the country as a whole worked better . 
  the country worked better under salazar ? 
  same shit , different smell . 
  the only difference back then was that you were n't allowed to express your distaste for the shit they did . 
   i think the newer generations of portuguese people are conflicted in their inability to truly get away from the characteristics you mentioned about the older generations . 
  oh , the newer generations do can get away from this , in fact , they 're physically leaving portugal by the thousands because of the shit the older generation left them to take care of . 
   apart from generations of accounting students worldwide who have deeply hated this 15th century italian friar !, 
  i thought accountants had to learn how to record the financial movements in a company and not accounting history and that kind of crap . 
  i 'm both a portuguese and eu citizen , yet i do n't hold dual citizenship . 
  portugal : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hla3avlz5xo, 
  are you serbian ? 
   what the fuck did we do to you ? 
  you know what you did . 
  signed , * netherlands *, 
  there 's no state in somalia yet that whole place is a shithole . 
  sure , you could say that they still have some sort of capitalism , but how are you meant to abolish it without the state ? 
   i have one idea , mainly for the more anglo-saxon and anglo-irish of us   * *** learn more foreign languages and encourage others to *** hey everybody , the english are trying to learn our languages !, 
  whenever they try to communicate with us in our language , let us all immediately start speaking in english , that will surely help them !, 
  what kind of book would that even be ? 
  [ this is how i picture you ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1xxoqrm.jpg ) . 
   but nice one there , turning a nice message into insults out of the blue . 
  good job . 
  damn , you always feel insulted with the slightest thing , i ca n't even say you 're a sissy that you have to report me to the mods for discriminatory homophobic language . 
  you know what ? 
  if your feelings are hurt , that 's good , it means you have feelings . 
  now please stop being so sensitive about everything !, 
   nah everyone 's different from the portuguese troll armada . 
  just because you 're the over-sensitive kampf die kapital type and i 'm not , that does n't mean we 're that different . 
  i mean , i fit your description , i 'm nerdish , i 'm white , i play and used to play a lot of video games , i 'm not into heavy metal but i fucking love house music which older people also find quite distasteful and i could have gone into a career of it . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wlac6py.png ) , i think my reddit history indirectly tells how i 'm am . 
  i 'm sure we 're not that different , despite me also wanting not to be associated with you . 
  doing things requires work , i rather stay home and post on the internet !, 
   * organize in unions   * resist exploitation   * push for emancipation   * ??? 
   like nerdy white male , especially on here . 
  i 'm willing to bet that there are a lot more rpg ` ers ( even larp ` ers ? 
  ) , video gamers , heavy metal fans , it people , and other general geeks on reddit compared with the general population . 
   we 're so similar and yet so different . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd7yyquwp_o ), 
   portuguese , of course . 
   lest you are caught off guard by the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life what the fuck did you just fucking say about me , you little bitch ? 
   its sad if there are people that still think like this . 
  we are in the 21st century for gods sake . 
  i doubt there will be any war between greece and turkey i 'm pretty sure he was joking , he did n't even say turkey , he said ottoman empire :p, 
   and most religious people i know are , like you , right wing nuts . 
  and most religious people i know are , like you , dogmatic in their beliefs . 
  so maybe reconsider your socialism . 
   `` do n't do to others what you would n't want people to love to you '' sorry , i meant `` do n't do to others what you would want people to do to you '' . 
  we need a new borgia pope !, 
  those were the days !, 
   me too . 
  oh boy that would be simply awesome . 
  they would divide into two groups : enraged racists and racists that somehow manage to pretend they do n't mind it . 
  the religious people i know are actually from the least discriminatory people i 've ever met - whereas some people may make distasteful remarks about people from other ethnicities specially when these raise problems , the religious people never do that and always prove the most helpful to them . 
  heck , i used to go to church a lot when i was a kid and even though i 'm no longer religious , i still know these people , i admire them for their kindness , they constantly try to guide themselves with principles such as `` jesus is the father of all of us and he loves all his children the same '' , `` do n't do to others what you would n't want people to love to you '' and `` we are nobody to judge , life is its own trial and in the end there will be justice '' . 
  why do you have to be such an asshole and assume that every religious person is a racist prick ? 
   the 117 pedophile rapists who will choose the next pope *   and by pope they want a man who will be in charge of covering up pedophile cases around the world . 
  there is a reason the current pedo rapist pope was chosen . 
  he was in charge of the vatican secret police who were the head of covering up the cases . 
    as long as the new pope knows his role in covering up his fellow rapists crimes then he will get chosen . 
  yeah 86mitso , it 's all one big conspiracy orchestrated by the vatican with the help of the fyromians , frau merkel , the imf and the turk !, 
   easy answer : just raise customs for said companies in every country which signs this agreement . 
  why should the consumers have to pay for this ? 
   also because reddit 's retarded admins would probably ban me for doxxing myself . 
  nah , you 're free to spread your own personal info , just not that of others :p btw , what do you think of [ this music ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejn2y1-ufgw ) ? 
  your desktop is hilarious . 
  i wonder why you did n't blur out your user image like you blurred your name . 
   and no you are not , romania could have afforded to raise the minimum wage more when we had sustained 7 ~ 8 % economic growth , but all we saw were minuscule increases . 
  i wonder why you would want to raise the minimum wage if you had that strong economic growth knowing that the minimum wage does n't help in achieving that objective of sustained economic growth . 
   it 's not discriminating against anyone , having a higher minimum wage is just another form of social justice to an extent . 
  unfortunately the minimum wage does n't achieve its goal of increasing the pay of the average worker . 
  do n't get me wrong , i fully support the objective behind the minimum wage of increasing the pay of those who are the least qualified and are therefore paid less . 
  however that 's the wrong way to achieve that , if you do want to increase the average wage in your country you have to increase the bargaining power of the worker and you do that by both reducing unemployment and by giving the workforce opportunities to increase their qualifications . 
   there are several views on inflation , but in keynesian economics there is demand-pull inflation which happens when demand for products increases ( which in the end happens in time if people 's wages increase ) , there 's also the built-in inflation . 
  firstly , the minimum wage does not increase wages and secondly , you may call me a monetarist but inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon . 
   how would romania control wages ? 
  from my knowledge , unions have more control over wages , via negotiating with employers than the country , the only thing the government would control is the minimum wage and government worker wages . 
  there 's absolutely no problem with workers together with unions ( or even with lawyers , for that matter ) reaching an agreement with their employers over their payment , the only problem arises is when a third party decides what minimum wage should apply to an individual regardless of its opinion on the matter . 
  when that happens , most are unaffected but you do end up with some people having a much more difficult time being employed . 
   the minimum wages is what the name states , the lowest common denominator , it 's function is to raise the standard of living of the poorest employed .

  sometimes i 'd have trouble even fitting them in my backpack properly . 
  this was more than 10 years ago though , so maybe it 's no longer the case . 
  exactly , he was first and foremost the founder of our nation , although he is also known for his territorial gains ( he is `` the conqueror '' after all ) . 
  though the few kings after him also expanded portuguese territory . 
  i think people are more reluctant to celebrate him for territorial expansion , which has , to put it mildly , kind of fallen out of fashion since the 12th century , than for establishing portugal as a sovereign state , which is something people still relate to . 
  high temperature of 21 c and somewhat cloudy here . 
  so yeah , i 'm dealing rather well . 
  the weekend was absolute hell though ( high 20s and humid ) , though typical even for northern coastal portuguese summer . 
  in portugal our go-to spicy sauce is piri-piri sauce . 
  i 've seen sriracha occasionally but it 's not so frequent . 
  every week is n't common , but some people do have a gardener go every few months to do heavier and more thorough gardening work . 
  or `` viva '' . 
  it does n't seem to be as vital to the toast as respective words are in other places though . 
  people often toast without saying anything special . 
  or someone will just propose a toast by saying `` um brinde '' ( a toast ) but nothing is said by everyone . 
  yes we do , it 's rtp . 
  they have 4 channels among the 7 standard ones that everyone gets , and was the only broadcaster in portugal until the early 90s . 
  it has adverts , just like most private tv channels do . 
  usually 1000 mg , sometimes 1 g. also , if it matters to whatever you need this for : * the g for gram is lowercase * in most of europe , commas are used as decimal points so it 's just `` 1000 '' , since 1,000 is 1 * there should be a space between number and unit so it 's `` 1000 mg '' and not `` 1000mg '' sorry if it does n't matter to you and i just sound like a pedant . 
  can you give examples in english of what you 're talking about ? 
  oliven\u00e7a is actually still officially claimed by portugal , even though it 's been more than 200 years . 
  of course no one actually cares at this point and the people there today are undoubtedly spanish but it 's not an issue that 's easily solvable . 
  galicia was never portuguese though , and neither was it ever claimed by portugal . 
  yeah , i like sumol and frisumo much better . 
  it was hugely controversial at the time , with some people on the right going so far as to call it a coup . 
  the main centre-right party 's whole agenda for a few months was that the government was illegitimate and would fall in a matter of weeks . 
  portugal has a history of minority governments with parliamentary support from the main opposition party , so this was quite unconventional , especially since until then , the dividing line between the centre-left and the hard left was seen as stronger than the one between left and right . 
  our national broadcaster actually made ( makes ? ), 
  an adaptation of it ( focusing on our history , of course ) . 
  i 've only seen like 5 minutes of it once but as far as i can tell , it 's well liked . 
  americans eat them with bacon ? 
  wow . 
  nah we eat them plain or with sugar and cinnamon . 
  maybe in spain yes , but that 's not how it 's eaten here . 
  caf\u00e9s and bakeries here do n't typically serve churros . 
  usually , to find churros here ( or farturas , the somewhat similar but `` more portuguese '' snack ) , you go somewhere like [ this ] ( http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7530/1406/320/f-farturas.jpg ) . 
  maybe in spain people eat churros like we eat past\u00e9is de nata , but we do n't eat churros like we eat past\u00e9is de nata . 
  well , seems like there 's a difference here between portugal and spain then . 
  you typically get churros here from those portable food parlours you find at some festivities and you rarely see them anywhere else . 
  do note that churros here are also seen as a spanish thing , they 're not typical from here . 
  edit : also , they 're served with powdered sugar here , which apparently spaniards find strange . 
  i 've never heard of anyone eating churros for breakfast . 
  they 're street food here at least . 
  i feel like the pirates of the caribbean one where they retrieve a beating heart from a chest and fight over it also keeps on being on tv . 
   if you pretend to study in university should be `` intend '' not `` pretend '' . 
  pretend is fingir . 
  pretty much this . 
  go on then . 
  people from the alentejo region are stereotyped as lazy and slow . 
  there 's a whole genre of jokes devoted to that stereotype , kind of like dumb blonde jokes , but with lazy alentejanos . 
  though this is more a caricature than a stereotype at this point . 
  here in the north , people are stereotyped as being short tempered and direct and swearing a lot . 
  people from lisbon have the typical capital stereotype , being snobby and arrogant and barely acknowledging the existence of the rest of the country . 
  very partial and enthusiastic , as i guess is normal . 
  they root for the national team but analyse the game objectively , i.e. 
  if there 's a penalty against us , the commentators do n't tend to let their affiliation influence their opinion on whether it was fair . 
  they 'll also root for portuguese clubs when they play foreign clubs , but usually more discreetly . 
  edit : if by partial you mean biased , then not very , see the rest of my comment . 
  i once heard an italian guy speak who had an otherwise perfect rp accent but still could n't get rid of that - a at the end of every sentence . 
  sounded quite bizarre . 
  slightly off-topic , but `` uhu '' is n't pronounced as a word here , but as `` u.h.u. 
  chewing gum are chiclets ( and an individual one is `` a chiclet '' ) . 
  a power drill is a black & decker . 
  an anorak is a kispo ( a portuguese brand that no longer exists ) . 
  a shaving razor is a gillette . 
  then there 's the typical ones also used in a lot of other countries , like tupperware , jeep or maizena . 
  that 's a bit strange though , it 's not at all common here to exclude ourselves from `` europeans '' . 
  slippers ( with socks ) . 
  my parents tend to wear normal shoes ( inb4 shocked northerners ) . 
  i 'll wear shoes too if i have visits , seems a bit rude to be in slippers or socks . 
  it 's common here too to ask something along the lines of `` is everything alright ? '', 
  when you see someone you know without expecting an answer ( other than the same thing back ) or even stopping to talk . 
  basically the same as `` hello '' . 
  and it gives you a chance to actually answer if you feel like it . 
  a duplex here is a flat with two floors . 
  a detached house is a house that does n't share any walls with other houses . 
   he was mp for hayes and harlington from 1983 to his retirement in 1997 , having unsuccessfully contested the seat of bristol south in 1979 , when he was defeated by labour 's michael cocks . 
   but are n't ministers also normally appointed ? 
  at least in the uk , which , let 's face it , is the country we all think about when this particular perspective comes up , all ministers have to be elected members of parliament , who in turn are elected as representatives of a constituency . 
  i think this difference in the whole democratic representation system can make it seem like the european comission and even parliament are less democratic . 
  ( sorry if i got anything wrong , please correct me if i did . ), 
  yeah we do n't even have a native word for pickles , we just say pickles . 
  it 's mostly an institutional day with a ceremony involving the president . 
  since the current president is in power , it 's been held in foreign cities with significant portuguese communities : paris in 2016 , s\u00e3o paulo this year , next year it will be in the us . 
  it does n't really celebrate an event in our history though , it 's the day of the death ( as the day of birth is n't known ) of one of our great national symbols , 16th century poet lu\u00eds de cam\u00f5es . 
  yeah sorry if that was confusing . 
  what i meant is that these numbers also change when they 're a part of a larger number . 
  so for instance the `` two '' in `` thirty two '' will change according to gender like `` two '' does . 
  as will `` four hundred '' in `` three thousand four hundred and fifty six '' . 
   meteorologisch `` meteorol\u00f3gico '' is also commonly mispronounced in portugal , as `` metreol\u00f3gico '' . 
  it 's so bad that pronouncing it correctly sometimes sounds weird . 
  we have that for 1 , 2 , every hundred except 100 and 2000 . 
  this applies when it 's just one part of a number too , so any number ending in 1 or 2 , any number whose third-to-last digit is not 0 or 1 , and any number whose fourth-to-last digit is 2 will have different masculine and feminine forms . 
  no one actually struggles with this , that i know of . 
  so maybe it 's just less complicated than in your case . 
  except when they do , that 's the problem . 
  these end letters are usually pronounced when the next word starts with a vowel . 
  eliminating them from the spelling would just create an `` add a random extra letter to this word in some contexts '' rule . 
  yeah , in portugal too , `` storm in a glass of water '' . 
  i doubt most people know what the symbol actually is .

  specifically the saudi arabian regime that promote their extremist and backwards branch of islam . 
  and also the west had only itself to blame for destroying the secular alternatives in those countries that they compared to the soviets . 
  considering that the most bloody terror attack in scandinavia was commited by a white supremacist i think they should reconsider their position on allowing far-right ideologies to take root . 
  they should stamp out those lunatics . 
  that 's the point of the joke ... 
  in netherlands there 's no hills . 
  the most rated comment on that youtube video ... hahahahaha, 
  well , it was a tremendous coincidence that so many influential people were in that plane and that it crashed . 
  i can see why conspiracy theories would pop up . 
  in portugal we also had a prime-minister that died in a plane crash in the seventies and there 's still a debate if it was a murder or not ( nowadays investigators tend to believe it was ) . 
  my view point is that i wo n't suport a common military in an european union that continually tries to humiliate my country , and force unfair cuts to the majority of its population that are tantamount to economical sanctions instead of actively persecuting the real culprits and reform itself into an union that actually protects its member states instead of blackmailing them . 
  anything that increases france 's influence within the eu is good for me . 
  i 'm tired of the excessive influence of germany and when the relation of power between germany and france was more balanced things worked much better . 
  no you ca n't . 
  i wo n't bleed for another country if that country does n't exhibit solidarity torwards mine nor shares the same set of values . 
  i definitely do n't want a common military or common nukes with a lunatic like kaczynski . 
  and same sex marriage ? 
  a european military implies a tighter eu , with more shared responsabilities between the different countries . 
  now tell me why should some countries chip in to an european army if that eu treats those countries like crap and demands ridiculous sacrifices to its populations . 
  no thank you . 
  want a common military ? 
  ok , lets have common bond treasuries , lets have an upper chamber in the european parliament where each country is equally represented and not proportionally to safeguard each countries interests . 
  lets have a talk about debt relief for greece , italy and portugal . 
  lets talk about enforcing the rules on germany for them to control their obscene budget surplus which is against the eu rules but everyone turns a blind eye to that . 
  as long as it keeps working and prove the international community wrong about their viability and seriousness ... and they managed to stop the attack on the portuguese middle and lower class , the national health service , public education , public transports , etc , etc. 
  holy crap , that ca n't be in vietnam . 
  amazing !, 
  no it 's not . 
  nothing forces other parties to have to accept conditions from the party that earned the most votes but not enough to govern if they do n't want to . 
  if the party that won the elections ca n't find partners then the second most voted party must be called to try to form a functioning coalition . 
  that 's not undemocratic . 
  democracy allows majority rule but assures protection of minorities against majority rule via an independent justice system , political bodies selected through distinct elections ( ex . 
  president , upper camera of parliament ) . 
  i do n't understand why most people seem to forget this . 
  if he wants european nukes then he would have to be in favour of tighter eu integration and a bigger step torwards federalization , something that him and a bunch of other eastern european countries are adamantly against . 
  plus , the french have nuclear weapons . 
  they just have to make it clear that an attack against any member of the eu would lead to the deployment of said nukes . 
  most europeans know him as the right wing lunatic that unfortunately saw his brother die in that plane crash . 
  i would . 
  paris is undoubtedly the cultural capital of europe and also one of the most populous cities of the continent . 
  if it 's written we can understand a lot . 
  i used to vacation in galicia and i would read marca every day and i never had any difficulty doing that , or reading local newspapers or el pais for that matter . 
  occupied by who ? 
  i would say we are free south galicia . 
  we do n't have to bend the knee to no king from castille . 
  when i lived in sweden and the us i often had people asking me where from russia i was because they could n't understand my words but found the sounds similar . 
  and a friend of mine is actually married with a russian and when she speaks on the phone with her family it sounds like she 's speaking gibberish portuguese hahaha . 
  spanish people ca n't understand portuguese because they are arrogant and do n't make an effort to understand us . 
  :p joking aside , portuguese spoken by a portugal native is phonetically very different from spanish and other latin languages . 
  we do n't open our vowels and we actually have a lot of sounds that make it sound similar to russian . 
  brasilian portuguese is easier for other latin people to understand since they open their vowels and speak more slowly than us . 
  galicians are portuguese that did n't get their independence . 
  that escalated quickly . 
  lets send them all to hungary and then kick hungary out of the eu !, 
  this fucker has no shame . 
  for sure . 
  i applied to postdocs there ... 
  germany also does n't pay that well . 
  and turkey is one in all but in name . 
  maybe in the uk is different but in portugal we 've been voting for the lesser of the two evils almost since we became a democracy again . 
  and it 's the best way to vote . 
  these are n't beauty pageants . 
  vote on the one that screws you less not the most shiny . 
  do n't put every socialist party in the same bag as yours . 
  otherwise you would have to thing that merkel is the same as \u00d3rban for example . 
  trust me . 
  not to the extent of sweden . 
  and from what i 've mostly lived people still are very attached to the parents even when studying in other cities , often visiting every other weekend it every weekend . 
  and people from lisbon do n't leave their parents house when going to college . 
  there 's hungary already in for that . 
  it 's cultural really , it 's easy to understand that greeting is different in different countries . 
  it 's not because of that that notherners are perceived as cold and unwelcoming , it 's mostly smaller things in social interactions , certain social norms which are very different ( ex . 
  kids moving away from the parents when the go to college while in the south it 's very common to have a strong connection untill quite late in life ) , certain socialization meetings which are very different ... heck , i think that swedish people were way more friendly and open to new people than portuguese from lisbon . 
  i really liked swedish people , although i also had two or three unpleasant interactions because i was from southern europe ( although not by swedes but from dutch co-workers ) . 
  not really . 
  you just made yourself look like a fool . 
  do you have the maturity level of a 5 year old to refer to another person like a fat beardy man ? 
  that 's how we do in portugal . 
  it was fun when i moved to sweden and greeted the swedish girl that helped me settle in erasmus the same way and she reacted weirdly . 
  hungary and poland should lose their right to vote as well . 
  for me , the most positive result in this poll is that the afd is decreasing in the polls . 
  it seems he is aggregating votes from people that were going to vote for afd . 
  english centric news channels are very biased to only give news of certain countries unfortunately . 
  agreed . 
  however the us should remove every nuke from turkey . 
  erdogan is not trustworthy . 
  yes . 
  that 's the fear . 
  and the funny thing is that her electoral base does n't give a fuck about her being corrupt while preaching that they want someone honest . 
  russia has thousands of nukes . 
  dude , the uk still did n't feel the effects of the vote because everything is still the same . 
  that 's just what i was saying . 
  and portugal this year actually did pretty well . 
  the feeling is reciprocal from europeans towards the uk . 
  i just hope our leaders do n't sour the relationship between the uk and eu any more . 
  i never said i was making fun of brits . 
  you deserve all the respect of everyone . 
  you took a sovereign decision that i do n't agree with but you are adults . 
  however you still are in the eu and growth is still connected to the eu . 
  as a matter of fact the eu grew more than the eurozone so something is not working well for the countries with the euro currency .

  oh , the irony !, 
  nameless is quite funny , though . 
  well , that 's not really late if you compare to a some other modern democracies . 
  switzerland allowed women suffrage in 1971 . 
  in portugal , some women were allowed to vote , but full and equal rights were only established in 1976 ( two years after the carnation revolution ) . 
  same happened in spain . 
  considering liechtenstein is a really small and isolated country , and because switzerland adopted rather late too , it kind makes sense they were able to keep their traditions for longer instead of moving with the times . 
  yup , portugal 's highest mountain is in the middle of the ocean . 
  a bit more of context would be nice . 
  dollars are often used by british ex-colonies , so it was n't that hard to guess . 
  funny thing , the us adopted the dollar because of the spanish dollar . 
  i know the currencies . 
  i have no idea about the exchange rates . 
  will we talk about th positive growth rate in the vatican ? 
  so you will send them to syria were they can join the ongoing war ? 
  basically you are supporting terrorism . 
  if they have joined isis , ca n't you simply charge them with joining a terror organization , instead of your dumb solution ? 
  who the hell is joana ? 
  indeed , i simply singled out europe , because of the forum . 
  this will be huge for europe . 
  after the success of ligo , this mission will open an amazing new field in physics . 
  i 'm quite excited for it . 
  regarding the spanish anthems : the first version of the himno de riego sounds quite celtic or medieval . 
  i was n't expecting something like it . 
  portuguese empire - [ hino patri\u00f3tico ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0xkknph7ka ) ( en : [ patriotic anthem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hymno_patri%c3%b3tico ) ) - considered the first national anthem , it was used from 1809 to 1826 ( liberal revolution happened in 1820 and the liberal wars started in 1828 ) and it was quite popular among the troops of wellington during the napoleonic invasions ( peninsular wars ) . 
  constitutional monarchy - [ hino da carta ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_x4k07mv0 ) ( en : [ hymn of the charter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hino_da_carta ) ) - adopted after the liberal wars by d. pedro iv ( also first emperor of brazil ) . 
  abolished in 1910 with the implementation of the republic . 
  portuguese republic - [ a portuguesa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mksq6_xhvjq ) ( en : [ the portuguese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_portuguesa ) ) - adopted after the implementation of the republic . 
  with a clear influence from the french anthem , the anthem was composed in 1890 during a nationalist drive ignited by the british ultimatum . 
  the initially lyrics feature a line saying * `` against the britons , march , march !, 
  '' * , then changed to * `` against the cannons , march , march ! '' * . 
  it is the anthem currently in use . 
  ps : i had no idea about the first two anthems even existed . 
  this was my til moment about my country . 
  entrance of kosovo and serbia in the eu involves solving the dispute . 
  if they enter in the eu , they will do it together , in my opinion . 
  kosovo wo n't be entering alone as some eu countries do n't recognize it and one of the chapters for serbia to enter in the eu is to improve relations with kosovo . 
  considering kosovo wants to get into the eu and think it will involve a double entry . 
  oh , stupid autocorrect that does n't know french !, 
  they are different parties . 
  both centrist but en marche is new . 
  i do n't know if they differ much in policies but my take is that , if rem survives long enough to establish as a party , they will eat all of modem . 
  edit : en marche , not enough marche, 
  i mean , i understand someone would have no data for croatia since it is the newest member or that malta is not represented because it 's quite small , but why miss cyprus ? 
  besides , why is not ireland represented in the table ? 
  there was an article ( i think it was posted here ) , which it stated that montenegro had spent a lot of money in their local election ( around 2014 , iirc ) , contracting a loan they could n't pay and ballooning their debt . 
  i have no idea if those are related , but i though about share it . 
  hopefully someone who actually knows about the subject will step in . 
  oh , the tree !, 
  i know it must only be a typo , but before opening the post , i was really confused about the title . 
  will they send the luftwaffle ? 
  wait are you serious ? 
  i though this would be an amazing trolling , but now i 'm not really sure . 
  how unlikely would it be if this was an attack of isis on muslims ? 
  it is not the first time we heard isis claiming muslims should not feel safe in europe and maybe they tried punitive measures . 
  i think it is a valid scenario until it is officially excluded . 
  this is really bad , considering how tight on funds they will be . 
  so the guy in fn in france 24 wants a central bank capable of printing money without renouncing the euro . 
  i guess he 's defending more powers for the ecb . 
  yeah , i was n't expecting it . 
  it really seemed they would fail the threshold . 
  good for them . 
  the others in the ipsos poll ? 
  can i see the source where you 've saw that ? 
  edit : i 've found it on le monde . 
  it seems france 24 was combining fi and pcf , while le monde separates them . 
  thanks anyway . 
  first i would like to say that i would be voting regardless , even vote blank if i felt too , but i understand people who would n't . 
  i still urge people to vote . 
  this being said , i do believe not voting will discredit the result and macron knows this , as he tried to improve the turnout . 
  i can imagine in the following years , whenever macron proposes an unpopular law , people in the streets claiming he does n't represent france . 
  others might even criticize him for killing the voting enthusiasm . 
  some of this criticism might not be fair but it will certainly happen and it will harm macron 's mandate . 
  his presidency wo n't be as swift as his supermajority seems to suggest . 
  edit : layout, 
  well , i would imagine some people would not vote just to discredit the result . 
  they are complaining by not voting . 
  thank you !, 
  i tried to find a similar map for the first round . 
  this is amazing . 
  i do n't see many candidates that can do it . 
  i 'm afraid , in order to achieve a parliamentary group , the socialists and france insoumise will have to join forces , which i 'm not sure if it will happen . 
  but i do share your hopes . 
  you may say this as a joke but i would n't be surprised if something like that happened and no one would be laughing afterwards . 
  our intergalactic space lord is right . 
  the british should held a referendum on whether a referendum should be held . 
  well , i would like not to . 
  i do n't think is fair to remove one 's rights and maybe the eu will find a way to grant those rights to the british or grant citizenship to those who apply for it . 
  but this situation is way more serious than that . 
  the fact is that the uk voted to leave the union . 
  if scotland had voted to leave the uk , they most likely would be denied british citizenship . 
  i 'm afraid we ca n't simply have the uk leave the eu and its citizens legally staying . 
  it does n't seem feasible to any part . 
  of course you could always move to the eu and apply for an european citizenship and then you 'd retain your european rights . 
   the idea of stripping someone of their citizenship ( without them acquiring foreign citizenship or renouncing their own ) seems almost nazi to me . 
  first you are acquiring ` foreign ' citizenship - british citizenship that will be ` foreign ' to the eu . 
  second nazi , really ? 
  good for her , but she really should n't need pope 's encouragement . 
  can you expand a little bit on the details ? 
  maybe a link , if possible ?

  sure , most of the bail-out money goes back to european banks ... as payments for loans undertaken by the greek state in the decade before the crisis * voluntarily * . 
  these loans were used to pay for many things inside greece , like salaries , pensions , health care , etc. 
  of course , part of it was siphoned off by the corrupt greek governments to no fault of the greek people ( and at no fault of anyone other than the greek governments at the time ) , but a huge part of it ended up in greek people 's hands ( look at all the gdp growth during those years ! ) . 
  you can argue that those banks did a mistake and should therefore have lost their money . 
  i agree with it in principle . 
  the problem ( that turns it into a grey area ) is that the alternative would have been for greece to default on all those loans - many of them by their own banking sector . 
  this translates into a complete banking collapse in greece ( which is terrible for anyone living in greece ) , as well as a high contagion probability in many other ez countries , and a probable collapse of the euro as well . 
   it 's not like the eu is overly democratic . 
  this is a mis-use of the term `` democratic '' . 
  the eu is n't democratic because they do n't want to give better conditions to the greek ? 
  the whole problem is that the creditor governments * can not * give better conditions because * their * electorate does n't want them to . 
  democracy does not mean the greek people can vote for better conditions , and others are forced to fulfill that . 
  democracy means that a taxpayer should have some say on where his tax money goes to ( usually by electing a government ) . 
  this means that it is `` undemocratic '' to force creditor countries to give greece more money . 
  ** it does not matter if what the creditors ' electorate believes in is completely wrong ** - it is `` undemocratic '' for them not to have a say . 
  now , what 'd make sense is a fiscal union , where all states pay eu-wide taxes , and have some measure of control of where other countries spend that money , for example an eu-wide pension programme , or unemployment subsidies . 
  these are examples of politically feasible ways to have inter-state transfers without the whole moral hazard of a pure transfers union . 
  france and germany are n't against the idea per se , but it 'll still take quite a while before this is instituted , assuming it ever is . 
   this will not allay the fears of people and prevent a bank run . 
  once they see a country exiting ( for whatever reason and under any circumstances !, 
  ) , they 'll absolutely move their capital . 
  it does n't cost them much and they 'd be foolish not to . 
  i mentioned that a bank run is a possible risk , and i explained why i thought you were over-stating the risk . 
  the eurogroup and ecb have much more information than us and should be able to much more clearly estimate how large that risk is . 
  consider that the current ez narrative is that greece is the only problem - all other countries that underwent a bailout program are growing and seem to be exiting the crisis . 
  for example , portugal ( the most likely contagion ) is currently growing and has enough money , that assuming a cut-off from funding ( but no banking collapse ) they would last until mid-2016 . 
  assuming a banking collapse , the story is different , but even if portugal had to request a second bail-out deal to recapitalize banks after a bank run , they would still have less debt as % of gdp than greece . 
  another important factor is how portugal 's current government is very much pro-austerity , so there is no doubt that they 'd come to a deal with the ez relatively quickly if a third bail-out were needed . 
  the elections in september might change this , but the only other party that has a chance of winning are the socialists - and if syriza fails , then it 's assured that the current government will be re-elected . 
  with a centre-right government , help from the ez is much less politically unfeasible for the creditor governments . 
  all this put together , i do not see enough instability for a bank-run in portugal right after a greek exit . 
  maybe a few months later if the country starts showing weakness , but not immediately . 
   why does your abovementioned explanation ( of why a bank run wo n't happen after grexit ) not apply to this kind of situation ? 
  it does apply . 
  by letting greece exit the ez , they * are * setting the precedent of the euro being revocable . 
  that 's bad . 
  however , my point is that if you weigh the risks , greece leaving is much less risky from the point-of-view of the creditors ( at least from the information that we currently have ) than other `` syriza-style '' parties winning in any of those countries where there could be a bank-run . 
  well , assuming the political situation in the eu does n't improve , sadly , yes . 
  and i 'm speaking as an euro-phile . 
  the only way i see a good result for greece and the eu as well is if greece votes ` yes ' , syriza falls , gets replaced by a `` more cooperative '' government ( making it less politically unfeasible for the creditor countries to offer better conditions ) , and in an year or so with an even worse situation , and with much more pressure on the creditor countries ( both internal and external political pressure , as well as from experts ) , greece gets offered debt restructuring . 
  though , in order to make sure that such restructuring is politically feasible in the whole ez , the eu would have to start working on integrating further , by building a fiscal union , so that the complaint of `` debt restructuring together with further loans '' being `` throwing more money down the drain '' becomes completely moot . 
  without such a fiscal union , any debt restructuring will be very hard to do , as without control over where greece spends money it is more likely that the public opinion of the creditor countries changes overwhelmingly to `` kick them out '' instead of `` debt restructuring '' . 
  it is nice to see that france and germany , for example , do not seem to be against the idea of a fiscal union , and have been slowly pushing for something of the sort within the ez . 
  any other chain of events will be terrible for greece , and not very good for the eu ( possibly ending in a collapse of the eu as a whole ) . 
  at least , that 's my opinion , considering the current political situation over the whole eu , and how the current events might change it in the near future . 
   the eu politicians have shot themselves in the foot by bluffing about forcing greece out of the ez if greeks vote no . 
  the thing is , it 's not a bluff . 
  the political situation at home for those creditors is very unfavorable to giving in to greece ( and the fact that it 's syriza only makes matters worse ) . 
  if they give in , it will be very hard to get a deal through parliament , and they 'll be committing political suicide . 
   so the fear , i think , is higher than ever and there would definitely be a bank run . 
  no , because the current narrative is `` greece is the only ` bad student ' , syriza is incompetent , other countries are recovering '' . 
  the only fear is speculation attacks on countries like portugal , but there 's also a very high chance that in keeping with this narrative , assuming the political situation in these countries does n't change ( and they do n't elect their own syriza - which if greek exits they most likely wo n't ) , they might be much more willing to do anything to save these countries . 
  ( and it might be much more politically feasible back home to do exactly that )  they will accept something like varoufakis ' modest proposal ( which is not a transfer union ) the problem is the precedent . 
  if they accept that proposal ( which includes debt restructuring ) , they 're setting the precedent that any country with problems like portugal and spain can get debt restructuring under the same conditions , all they have to do is to elect their own `` syriza '' . 
  denying those conditions to those countries would be impossible after such a precedent is set . 
  that is a * de facto * transfers union , and is how it is being spun in a lot of the press already . 
  i never said otherwise . 
  still , it might be much more politically feasible to do debt restructuring with a `` more co-operative '' government an year or so down the road , after syriza collapses , and therefore avoiding the fear of syriza spreading to other countries . 
  not that i find that exactly moral , but i see no other politically feasible alternative , sadly . 
  summed up , my point is that the creditor countries do n't have a politically favorable situation to give in even if the governments wanted to . 
  the best way forward would probably be to institute a `` controlled transfer union '' through more integration ( fiscal union ) , which will most likely be on the tables in the near future , as the current german and french governments do not seem to be opposed to the idea in principle , but it would still take a while to agree to . 
   what then ? 
  well , then the precedent for euro exit being possible is set . 
  with that we have two possibilities : 1 . 
  everything works out for greece . 
  other countries in similar situations realize that they 'd be better off outside the euro , and leave as well . 
  in the long-term , the euro dissolves . 
  greece completely collapses . 
  other countries in similar situations realize that it might be better to play along with the euro to avoid a similar situation , and parties like syriza lose voters . 
  moderate risk of contagion . 
  in the long-term , who knows . 
  maybe the euro dissolves , maybe not . 
  looking at similar situations to greece , like the argentina default , the second choice will almost certainly be what will happen after a grexit . 
  it 's pretty good for the creditors , terrible for greece . 
  alternatively , they could give in to greece , and what will happen is that they are guaranteeing that parties like syriza ( podemos , etc ) will get elected in spain , portugal , etc and demand equal treatment ( as is only fair ) . 
  they 've * de facto * instituted a transfers union , and many of the creditor countries ' electorates are dead-set against such a thing , so the responsible governments would be severely punished in the next elections . 
  --------- from the point of view of greece : 1 . 
  pretty good 2 . 
  terrible since 2 is overwhelmingly more likely looking at past imf defaults , the leverage is with the eu . 
  calm down a bit , i meant no offense . 
  i had re-read your comment and noticed i had forgotten to reply to one of your points , so i was editing it in . 
  since i never refreshed the page , i did n't notice you had replied already . 
  the fear for a bank run in the periphery countries can happen , sure , and it 's what will end up deciding if the ez folds or not . 
  the risk is n't that large right now , though , since greece is a relatively small country and none of those periphery countries currently has a party like syriza in power . 
  on the other hand , you have the risk of the ez being `` blackmailed '' by podemos and other parties like that in the future , if they fold to greece , basically it would lead to the institution of a transfers union . 
  this , together with the `` lazy greeks '' narrative , will make it very difficult for the creditor countries to give into greece 's demands - it would never pass all the parliaments even if most of them wanted to . 
  from the point of view of a creditor country like germany , the `` better '' option , at least politically ( seeing as how a transfers union is very unpopular ) , is to at most offer the same deal that was on the table on the 27th/28th . 
   the voters do n't want grexit . 
  the problem is that the voters in a lot of the eu * want * a grexit , if the alternative is instituting a * de facto * transfers union . 
  it would be political suicide for merkel ( and other creditor governments ) . 
  not for giving in to greece per se , but for setting the precedent that if another country wants `` free money '' , all they have to do is elect their own `` syriza '' . 
  ( i know that it is n't exactly `` free money '' , but remember that the narrative in many countries is that the `` lazy greeks '' want more `` free money '' ), 
  i 'm not contradicting myself . 
  a switch to drachma requires an exit of the ez . 
  [ an exit of the ez , assuming no treaty change , requires an exit of the eu . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3bu41o/eli5_why_is_it_considered_difficult_for_a/cspolut ) therefore , if greece refuses whatever deal the ez gives it ( which will be the case if they vote for `` no '' , and the ez does n't fold ) , they 'll have to `` voluntarily '' switch to drachma . 
  oops . 
  i 've fixed it , thanks for pointing it out :d, 
  still , my point was that it 's very easy to argue for debt restructuring when you 're not losing any money , or when you wo n't suffer consequences from your electorate , 
  though it 's delusional not to realize that the likelihood of greece ending up * having * to leave the euro is much higher after a `` no '' vote .

  that was my 1st thought , fellow gamer :-),

  it could also stand for , say , `` sufficiently united kingdom '' . 
  let 's be positive !, 
  is n't this as much difficult as recruiting , say , nazi jews ? 
  it seems that either way the name `` uk '' is safe . 
  no need for changes like : - formerly united kingdom or ( opposite outcome ) - finally united kingdom or - scarcely united kingdom ... ? 
  anyway , there would be an abbreviation problem . 
  * ( peace ) *, 
  ok , i understand what you meant . 
  i was just focussing on the brain drain subject , but nowadays every discussion in this sub seems to come back to austerity politics ... well , i ca n't resist giving my 2 cents to that : i understand that germany thinks that what was a success overcoming its own reunification issues will be a success if applied to all of the eurozone ( even all of eu ) . 
  well , i do n't dispute that . 
  i think it 's brilliant , logical and effective -- * given those conditions * . 
  however , it can only work if what i said in my previous comment also applies . 
  and i do n't see any chance of that in the near future ( i can hear the mob screaming `` federalism !!!, 
  '' ) , not in present eu . 
  i 'm afraid the results will then come out quite different . 
  sorry , but are n't you referring to the east vs. west half of germany ? 
  east germans were migrating to the west , not to other countries , right ? 
  comparing the situation there with the one we were discussing ( all of eu ) , i suggest looking into some differences : * east germans were migrating to the same country , probably as far as some hundred kilometers , but to somewhere speaking their language . 
  * german government made massive money transfers and other types of help to the former east germany . 
  * there is only one government and a single policy in germany , one set of laws and taxes ... * ( i could go on forever here ... ) with 80 million people you can make you own internal economic policy . 
  with 10 it just is n't possible . 
  eu has hundreds of millions , yes , but each country is just caring for itself . 
  therefore , not relevant for this discussion . 
   how has growth been since the euro in portugal and how has it been before the euro ? 
  let 's see : [ gdp , constant prices , ref = 2006 ] ( http://www.pordata.pt/en/portugal/growth+rate+%28percentage%29+of+gdp+and+gdp+per+capita++constant+prices+%282006%29-883 ) ( quick exec summary  year | var . 
  ( % ) -- | -- | 1990 | 8 | | 2000 | 4 | | 2001 | 2 | | 2002 | 0,7 | | 2003 | -0,9 | | ... | i guess it 's alarmingly self-explanatory . 
   not all of europe is stagnant : uk , switzerland , sweden , norway , poland are doing great . 
  ( not in the euro . ), 
  well , the `` not in the euro '' bit seems important . 
  or even `` not in the eu '' for half of the examples ^ ( i count the uk as 50/50 here ... ) i 'm not suggesting anything . 
  just the facts . 
  well , if you have one let 's hear it . 
  i do n't have any sure and clear one that only depends on that country alone ( portugal in my example ) . 
  but there are others that can break the cycle ( same example ) : * eu starts an economic growth cycle . 
  like in the 1950-2000 era , that would be jolly . 
  europe would carry our economy forward , buying our stuff or even invest here or something ( one can dream ... ) ( well ? 
  what are you waiting for ? 
  we 're hoping for this since we joined the euro !, 
  and no , < 1 % growth does not qualify , sorry . ), 
  * some other ( emergent ? ), 
  economies suddenly need something they can get here for cheap ( at least cheaper than elsewhere ) . 
  : sines port overtakes rotterdam , or some other impossible dream like that . 
  as long as europe stays stagnant , so will we . 
  rebounding to year 2000 gnp will take years at this rate . 
   benefits to the country by allowing the job market to become relatively less saturated please do tell me about these . 
  i do n't see many aside those for the currently employed individuals . 
   and i do n't see how this will create a loop . 
  well , let me then break that down for you : preconditions : - country invests heavily in education . 
  note : this is expensive , and comes from taxpayers pockets . 
  rationale is that to be a developed country today , highly trained people are key to be able to use and advance technology , mainly bot not limited to industry ; - some world-wide catastrophic event occurs ( e.g. , some lehman brothers whatnot in another continent ) ; now for the loop : - recession ensues , and you 're suddenly left with lots of highly qualified people with nothing to do ; - they of course start seeking jobs elsewhere . 
  they 're highly qualified , remember , so there are lots of nice places to choose . 
  let 's say `` england '' . 
  - after they left , they leave the job market relatively less saturated . 
  nice ? 
  - then , after cleaning up most of the rubble and ruins left by aforementioned catastrophe , the country tries to come out of recession . 
  after years of it , there 's a lot of catching up to do to get to where it was before the crash . 
  - what to do ? 
  being more competitive , silly !, 
  so , let 's do it !, 
  we can lower some company taxes , etc. . . - this , however , hits a wall : how to get more competitive without more highly qualified people ? 
  remember , they left in that bullet above . 
  - no matter , we 'll just train more !, 
  we now know how to do that ... 
  wait !, 
  there 's a problem here : - among the first to leave are researchers and other professors at university level . 
  you are now left with lower standards of education at the higher level , and that will percolate to lower levels ( high school , and so on ) . 
  - compound the above problem with a demographic one : each year you have less students at all levels of education . 
  result : no way to substitute those who emigrated . 
  * please note that in a recession people refrain from having too many children , so this guarantees this demography for a 20 years time frame * . 
  - since you are still trying to come out of recession , not much money is available to lure those guys ( or nationals from any other country for that matter ) . 
  - with a shortage of highly trained professionals , your plan to have more competitive industry and/or services has limited success . 
  let 's face it : it just sinks . 
  - go to step 1 . 
  recession ensues , and you 're suddenly ( ... ) satisfied ? 
  i tried to get it as explicit and detailed as possible without getting too specific to a single situation . 
  * sources : portugal 1995-2014 . 
   just because it 's left spain or portugal or greece or italy does n't mean it 's disappeared . 
  not really sure what you mean , but the point here is that spain or portugal or greece or italy lose those expensively trained professionals . 
  with obvious consequences for that country , which in turn will make that trend more likely in the future , in a positive feedback loop . 
  for the individuals it 's likely ( in general ) a positive move , or they would n't be making it in the first place .

  now , in a real basketball game ... 
  thanks for pointing out we are ahead of italy in one field !, 
  who would have ever imagined .

  i see buddhist setting themselves on fire but not blowing themselves up in crowded markets,

  if this guys want me to hate islam , they are doing a good job . 
  if i understand what your saying ... they subsidize production ? 
  but ... that \u00b4 s only good for domestic consumption !,

  wow ... how can switzerland , france , italy be any competitive with such high production costs ?

   '' ... leaving the eu , england can arrange new partnerships with , brazil , china ... and we estimate a gdp grow of 1.1 % a year , in this scenario '' with that anemic grow inflation will eat your wealth !, 
  ... people buy this shit ? 
  what ? 
  so when you say the gdp in 2006 has been 293939 trillions pounds , for instance . 
  i \u00b4 m i suppose to believe that this value is the same today ? 
  ... ** no ** it isn \u00b4 t ... it \u00b4 s less in pounds than the equivalent in euros . 
   `` the gdp grow in eu is less than in the us , australia ... and even england '' and the inflation ? 
  ... the inflation in eu has been lower , in the same period , when compared to the inflation in those countries !, 
  well he got facts to back his positions ... 
  religions brought to society among other things war and destruction ... it still does, 
  putin bought a war he can \u00b4 t win ... it \u00b4 s destined to lose, 
  sorry man but i feel offended by the treatment uk has given to an effort made by 27 countries representing millions of people to build a better future for europe . 
  it \u00b4 s insulting and illogical ... uk wants to be more isolated in a more globalized world . 
  and banks to finance the reconstruction, 
  not again this shit ... just fucking leave the eu . 
  europe has the power to pull switzerland plug ... switzerland exist because it serves the interests of many people in developed countries ... but with countries going bankrupted ... they will probably start to talk the small talk,

  i wonder what father russia has to say about that !, 
  the problem with democracy is when the majority is wrong , and the minority has to pay for that . 
  isn \u00b4 t israel promoting this anti-jew segregation ? 
  ... maybe to bring more jews to israel and keep the ones already there , inside . 
   and all it took was a downed airplane . 
  it \u00b4 s disappointing that countries like germany need a downed airplane to realize the threat in putin \u00b4 s actions, 
  `` strangest economic recovery '' = cooked books, 
  let us sit and watch live , the extermination of the palestine people !, 
  ... maybe give them a hand to fight israel so this can be quicker, 
  i won \u00b4 t talk about ira because i don \u00b4 t know a lot of what happened there ; but in gaza hamas extremism is fueling a war they can \u00b4 t possible win , and palestinians are dyeing because of that ... hamas attitudes are killing palestinians ... it \u00b4 s clear that palestinians enemies are israel and hamas . 
  this people are real stupid ... it \u00b4 s insulting to think that hamas isn \u00b4 t responsible for what is happening in gaza ... they are for me the first responsible for the bloodshed , even before the jews ; the extremism in both sides is responsible for the war in gaza , and this people want to fuel more extremism ? 
  ... shitty people that \u00b4 s what they are . 
  old school ... they probably don \u00b4 t have nothing better for president ... the mafia is closed for new memberships . 
  this is politics that is being played with kremlin ... in the lack of a military invasion from russia , this people are sending the message that they will tell what they know about russian involvement in this conflict , trying to force a military invasion . 
  i \u00b4 m afraid there \u00b4 s a good chance of that to happen ... but i don \u00b4 t think russia will go to all ukraine ... it \u00b4 s to big . 
  probably will try to install a small buffer state in eastern ukraine . 
  that reminds me of one of capitalism problems , especially before 2008 crisis and in big companies ; it \u00b4 s a common place to ceo \u00b4 s and executive boards to make decisions that boost short/medium term profits at the expense of the company survival in the long run . 
  for now everybody is happy ... the ceo gets his bonus and the shareholders their money for the great results of the company ... in the long they will be out of business , but who cares the ceo probably won \u00b4 t be the same anyway, 
  good to see some humanity in the treatment that innocent people deserve, 
   also , what makes you say they 're drunkards ? 
  people with something in their heads don \u00b4 t do what they do , grabbing weapons a 4 day crash course on how to handle those guns and go to another country to fight nazis ... that and the images of their interviews with them being drunk, 
  that will be the end of russia as we know it, 
  well , that explains a lot ... 
  stock market is a colossal bubble thanks to the cheap money from the fed, 
  hamas is a disease that with the help of israel is slaughtering palestinian population, 
   this is a facile argument . 
  the jobs `` locals do n't want '' have traditionally been filled by the young and struggling . 
  wrong . 
  in portugal we have high unemployment and there are employers who ca n't find workers , especially in agriculture ; it \u00b4 s true that this jobs are bad paid and people prefer to stay at home and receive unemployment pension , but this jobs are typically filled by immigrants , that are better workers , more trained in this kind of jobs , and often bring their families to portugal after some time here ; young people don \u00b4 t want this jobs , because they are bad paid and because is perceived as a 3rd class job by this youngsters , but still relevant to emigrant workers  but the contributions of unskilled , uneducated immigrants are negligible . 
  more than 20 % of switzerland population is made of immigrants ; skilled or non skilled you tell me that this is negligible ? 
   there 's no reason european populations need to keep growing . 
  right , so where are you going to charge your taxes to pay for the pension of the elderly ? 
  amen, 
  actually the immigrants workforce benefits the country that receives them ; in part they do the work that locals do n't want , contribute to the welfare state and contribute to the working population for coming generations having more kids in average than locals ; you need to have someone to pull those elderly in wheelchairs !, 
  eu should deploy troops in the crash area , hunt down the perpetrators of this crime and bring them to justice ... russia ? 
  fuck russia ... if the west doesn \u00b4 t want a militar confrontation with russia , so doesn \u00b4 t they . 
   the satellites are sensitive enough to sense hot spots in forest fires , according to the air force .

  clear flying a very common route in a war zone at a commercial altitude did not prevent the disaster ... 
  i wonder if the people in that plane where warned about the fly plan ... 
  i wouldn \u00b4 t get in that fly in the first place . 
  sounds to me that air carriers want to avoid costs , choosing the shortest route, 
  very interesting ... there are clear 2 moments in the artistic representation ; the first one is a choreographic of a lot of people representing manual and repetitive work in a coordinated form ; the second one probably represents a more educated kind of worker , probably engineers , appearing not in vast numbers but in small teams playing and chanting , not like the first ones ... and speaking some kind of mantra , that they repeat endlessly ... kind of mind control thing ... creepy stuff,

  is not that i lose my sleep because of it , but yeahh, 
  look on the bright side ... this will make a lot of people rich , on bribes alone , so they could send their new stolen money to london , and the british can brag about how good they are dodging the crisis,

  what is toxic masculinity ? 
  italy is an economic powerhouse , even if they probably are n't in their best shape right now . 
  also most of sweden 's territory is completely devoid of any significant population . 
  how the fuck are they going to smuggle a nuclear bomb into the us ? 
  or do you expect isis to develop intercontinental ballistic technology in a decade ? 
  isis is terrible enough without needing to pile up unreasonable hysteria on top of it . 
  it would be funny if it had n't happened before . 
  if i were greece i would simply let them go where they want to go . 
  why would i put money down to keep them in a place they do n't want to be ? 
  they want to get to germany ? 
  great , germany 's problem . 
  force new elections in greece right now like that and watch syriza attain an absolute majority . 
  or force greece out of the eu first and see how the result is much more favourable to you if your goal happens to be `` remove the filthy leftists from power '' . 
  the people on the commission may be crooks but they are n't political imbeciles . 
   why should the north continue to pay the pensions and social services of a country that refuses to take the tough steps necessary to fix it 's economic mess ? 
  because voters have rejected this approach to the problem . 
  `` oh but you ca n't vote for other people to give you money '' . 
  that 's such a bullshit argument because nobody is claiming that . 
  the voters have blocked the continuation of what they perceive as failed austerity measures . 
  the greek government thus tries to negotiate different conditions . 
  if the lenders prove unreasonable then i believe they should call for new elections . 
  default on the imf debt , negotiate with the reasonable creditors then . 
  advocates for beating other people due to small theft . 
  checks out . 
  that 's not at all what i see happening in the video . 
  they make very little effort to restrain them , seem more interested in beating them . 
  i can understand why a thief would make anyone see red but really that is no excuse . 
  justice is not to be exercised by the victims . 
  in my experience those who generalize against a group of people are generally those who have little contact with said group . 
  case in point : pegida being strongest in the areas with fewest migrants . 
  then restrain her and call the police . 
  petty theft does n't give you the right to beat the criminal . 
  at least not where i live . 
  edit : seems like the stormfront brigade swept through . 
  btw street workers is an euphemism for prostitute in some places in portugal . 
  i wish reddit would stop circlejerking over this already . 
  it was not that big of a deal in portugal and we barely talk about it . 
  states are n't people and states are n't corporations . 
  you ca n't impose long periods of austerity on a nation based on previous debt . 
  it is not reasonable . 
  you of all nationalities should know this . 
  people will eventually vote the austerity supporters out , mainly because the majority is being punished for something they were not complicit in and saw no benefit from ( the oligarchs got most of the benefit , not the middle and working class ) . 
  they did it in greece , and they did it in another country in europe . 
  if this scotsman means that pharmacies ca n't refuse to open in certain areas effectively leaving the people without ability to get medicine , i for one welcome our new scottish overlords . 
  we ca n't just put our faith in some godlike being or concept that will make it all be good if we just let everything happen without regulation . 
  on a scale of 1 to 10 how triggered do you feel about people calling out a shitty sentiment for being shitty ?

  men do tend to murder a lot more than women though .

  so it seems you are not getting your money back here . 
  congratulations , your boneheaded refusal to acknowledge reality resulted in a lose lose situation .

  race your salaries and worker rights to the bottom , or else . 
  nice job bringing up godwin 's law when you were the first one to dismiss them because `` communist '' . 
  always a sure sign someone has no proper arguments to bring to the debate :-), 
  he was the one referring to it as a mercedes , not me . 
  i was just proving the analogy was silly because states should totally behave like people when it comes for finances when it fits with the neolib narrative of `` give us the choiciest slices of your public patrimony for cheap '' , but not at all when it comes to actually making sensible choices . 
  it 's kinda cute how you seem to believe any significant part of your money actually ever reaches athens . 
  what your analogy does n't factor is that if in the future greece tries to take its mercedes back it will be called a tyrannical communist country . 
  in the cult of the neolibs you can always privatise but nationalizing is a sin against the sacrosanct capital . 
  if you want to have a decent probability of getting your money back why are you demanding economy crushing austerity that all but guarantees a third , fourth and so on bailouts ? 
   i ensure you that i wish greece any every greek person the best for the future how can you do that and at the same time support those who impose measures that guarantee that there is no future ? 
  if i were a greek i would not be willing to take all of this in order to pay off national debt , i 'd rather default . 
  oh well , my bad . 
  goes to show how propaganda can really be effective if you are not paying attention . 
  hope you guys manage to shake off corruption !, 
  here in portugal we are set to elect the the party of a now arrested under suspicion of corruption ex prime minister !, 
  is n't podemos already caught in corruption scandals ? 
   in a negotiation , both parties cede grounds the very definition of a negotiation . 
  if one party has not ceded any grounds they did n't negotiate at all , they acquiesced to demands . 
   this is what i 'm talking about , now the eurozone does n't want to negotiate . 
  a year back they did but the previous governments were too slavish to try . 
  that 's an excuse and not a good one . 
  syriza never said the eurozone was willing to negotiate . 
  it was unknown if they were willing or not since political negotiations never took place . 
  at this point you seem to be doing justice to your username . 
   there is no mandate . 
  a government ca n't have a mandate on what to do with other countries ' money . 
  syriza and anel lied to everyone 's faces and they keep lying to them while their voters cheer them on . 
  it 's quite pathetic . 
  a government can have a mandate to seek a better deal , which is what syriza has . 
  if the other side proves to be completely unreasonable , that is hardly syriza 's fault . 
  also i fail to see how exactly they `` keep lying '' . 
  they seeked a fair deal , a more than fair deal for eurozone . 
  in your unbridled diatribe against syriza you manage to simultaneously blame it for ceding too much and for not ceding at all . 
  if i were to descend to your level i would call it quite pathetic . 
   the point of those bad deals could only have been to `` kick greece out of the eurozone '' , much like the point of this deal is according to you do n't put words in my mouth please . 
  the point of those bad deals for the eurozone was to cover its ass from the monumental shitstorm that would have been a 2010 grexit . 
  the eurozone does n't want to negotiate , which is it 's prerogative . 
  in doing so they leave little chance for anything but new elections in greece with an austerity government put back in place or a default . 
   ceding ground is treasonous according to the government parties . 
  in a negotiation , both parties cede grounds . 
  has far as i can see syriza is actually the first party to actually try to negotiate anything in respect to the debt crisis .

i think the main problem is that you have to pay them . 
  please for the love of god stop calling it oporto , you are saying theporto . 
  foreigners probably call it oporto because we use the before porto very often and we machine gun the name , but please do n't massacre our beloved northern capital name . 
  just to complete the info , portugal is named after it 's ix century capital [ `` portus cale '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portus_cale ) . 
  it was pronounced portus ** g ** ale , the name was then abbreviated to portucale after the city of gale fled to the north due to the moors and then it was abbreviated from portugale ( the pronunciation ) to -  portugal . 
  you already stole us the part of lusitania and now you want to steal our lusitan heroes too ? 
  ( no harm intendead just kidding , please do n't invade us ^ ^ ^ because ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ may ^ ^ ^ fail ^ ^ ^ again ^ ^ ^ xd ) for those who do n't know i 'll try to explain in my broken english . 
  portugal was formed by a man who is considered one of the greatest portuguese hero ( comes into topic ) his name was [ d. afonso henriques ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afonso_i_of_portugal ) . 
  d. afonso was a warrior king that conquered [ pretty much what portugal is today ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v3wkolp.png ) , he wanted to conquer area that was [ lusitania ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/lusitania.png ) , even thou it was against the treaties signed . 
  in 1169 d. afonso henriques moved from the city of \u00c9vora against badajoz successfully sieging the city , however when the portuguese were already beating up the moors in the streets the troops of the kingdom of leon surrounded the city and captured our wounded king . 
  in exchange foor the kings liberty they demanded the renouncing of the claims over those lands , give back the galician city of tui , give 20 war horses and pay 3000 kg of gold . 
  and that my firends is why the is a bit of lusitania that is n't in portugal , including the old lusitan capital , merida . 
  i hope i did n't bored you , i get a bit exited with history , and writing is n't my strenght so i 'm sorry for the layout . 
  for my portuguese friends here is the only extensive article i found about it , it shames a bit our king this episode so it is n't taught in schools .

   they are independent thanks to us ( spain could n't fight two wars at once , west and east , and concentrated fighting us ) that is a bit biased . 
  your revolution only gave us time to regroup and organize . 
  the spanish did n't forgot us , after defeating your rebellion they came after us and the beating and humiliation of the spanish invaders like [ these one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_lines_of_elvas ) or [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_ameixial ) ( although not so fantastic ) were done without help . 
  1/5th of the population in luxembourg is portuguese ... do n't know those that are luxembourgs but are of portuguese descent . 
  that is due to during the colonial war the famine ( the american led sanctions only affected the people ) and mass conscription , during those 13 years of war a 10 million people country was able to deploy 1,5 million man . 
  during that period 1,250 million people immigrated from portugal . 
  one of the countries that welcomed portugal was luxembourg , they were blooming and needed urgently man power so they offered shelter and manual works for the portuguese . 
  no matter how smart you were you could only be able to get manual jobs because more `` serious '' jobs required a full luxembourg nationality . 
  the portuguese are very present in the constructions business in luxembourg accounting for 95 % of the man power involved in the manual work, 
  we called our colonies there brazil , just like the 13 american colonies . 
  brazil is a federation of states like the us . 
  also we conquered spanish uruguay in 1816 . 
  in retaliation the spanish suspended any conversation of returning oliven\u00e7a violating the treaty signed by the defeated countries of the napoleonic wars . 
  brazil declared independence in 1822 . 
  we lost oliven\u00e7a due to the crown wanted to expand brazil and that lasted 8 years .

  every time a bullfight comes to my city the tickets disappear , it is rare to hear someone saying touradas should be abolished , we already abolished the killing of the bull in 1836 !,

  bulls are raised in big fields and have many partners to mate to continue their lineage , after 5-6 years of `` good life '' they go into the arena and are [ hit in the back where it does n't hurt as much . ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/bullfight%2c_portugal.jpg ) .

  the most widely known are the pure blooded lusitan horse , the oldest saddle horse race in the world with 5000 years , it is commonly used for equestrian ends and as a bullfight horse due to his courage . 
  the creation of the [ brave bull race ] ( http://c1.quickcachr.fotos.sapo.pt/i/b9a09d71d/11482700_dnbaz.jpeg ) it is also linked to the bullfights .

  also after the fall of franco there was an emigration wave due to the poverty in galicia again , it was not until the galicians threaten to join portugal that the spanish government started investing there . 
  galician is practically the same as portuguese . 
  saying it 's equal to spanish it 's like saying french and italian are the same . 
  let me rephrase then . 
  if galician has nothing to do with castillan then why it 's in the same `` area '',

  you do n't speak spanish ? '' . 
  no we do n't , for example the spanish say * estados unidos * and we say * estados unidos * ... oh wait bad example . 
  edit : added a few words for clarity . 
  most of those people in my country that lack secondary education are still a fallout of the dictatorship where people would normally only complete basic education . 
  after the fall of the regime they changed the minimum to 9nd grade and now the minimum is 12th grade . 
  also as said most of the unemployed are educated persons with a diploma because the high education jobs are saturated . 
  on the other hand there are areas in my country where uneducated people get easily a job due to low standards ( they take minimum wage and work in a skill job , something that persons with a diploma ** refuse ** to do ) . 
  it is the official soundtrack of every communist rally . 
  they are still stuck in 1975 , they were so close to installing [ a communist government . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coup_of_25_november_1975 ) fortunately we would have ` murica help freeing the shit out of us . 
  just kidding they would [ invade azores ] ( http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2010/11/19/us-plans-azores-1975/ ) to prevent it to fall to the ussr and leave us to die . 
  but lets give america some credit , they wanted to spread freedom so much that they were going to force a independence of azores ( in order for them to install a government that would give them the [ lajes base ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lajes_field ) ) .

  this music has been extremely overused by syndicalist ( the ones with communist ties , [ the cgtp ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ozqcaba6lt8/tdagexp-w9i/aaaaaaaaczm/o0bwfjfrifg/s1600/manif_cgtp_19maio_2 ) ) and left extremists groups .

  no wey , real man in polski only drink liquor ( yes , wine is fine ), 
  prepare for bad beer ( compared to mex ) and good liquor . 
  i hope you like to drink . 
  i still think for scenery madeira is probably best , but maybe it does n't count idk . 
  it 's common for jihadis to think that shia are crypto-zoroastrian or crypto-jews ` faking it ' , thus the insult that all shia are secretly zoroastrian/polytheist . 
  yeah it 's pretty standard jihadi vocab to refer to any shia as one of ` persians ' ` rejectors ' ` fire worshippers ' etc. 
  to give more background , before the euro , eder was kind of a ` washed up ' player , mostly a substitue , one of the last picked for the international team etc. 
  casual fans did n't even know he existed . 
  he 's still really mediocre , but after coming in as a sub and scoring a hero goal in the euro he has become a national meme all over portuguese internet and r/portugalcaralho , often referred to in religious terms like lord and saviour , best footballer of all time etc. 
   what would be your solution for the middle east ? 
  try to think that trough . 
  how about the middle east gets to solve middle eastern problems and not us ? 
  why are you so paternalistic toward other people ? 
  i want the actual estimate of dead germans required for you to not feel compelled toward shaming them for being angered . 
  20k , 500k ? 
  lets put a number on it . 
  it appears muslims are accepted to be angry due to meddling in their countries , so there must have been a number that made this acceptable . 
  how many europeans need to die so that we can make equal excuses for who has justifiable anger . 
  how many innocent people need to die before you accept anger as a reasonable response . 
  can you put a rough estimate on it ? 
  try reading the article you comment on . 
  she 's obviously more loyal to her ethnic group than denmark . 
  maybe she did n't pay attention in the multiculturalism classes . 
   that stems from moving to a country that speaks and entirely different language with usually no relatives or acquintances and has completely different customs just to improve their lives . 
  glad we agree they can stop moving to europe if it encourages them to go jihad . 
  yes , we should be nice to terrorists or they might become more extreme . 
  also , we should stop investigating mafias , it will only make impressionable youth more likely to join the mafia . 
  we should appease them until they become peaceful . 
  it will be worse most likely . 
  vote for frauke and stop importing people who hate you . 
  let 's see if the upper middle class berlinners learn what their mates in the east have been warning them about for the last 4-5 years now ( they wo n't ), 
   from the rest of the world . 
  i think you mean mena and pakistan . 
  wake me up next time a korean does a suicide attack in pest . 
  isis believes their sole purpose in life should be to establish a global caliphate . 
  winning or losing is irrelevant to the goal , it 's their religious duty to give it 100 % . 
  westerners like to pretend there is some other advanced methodology because they project their own quasi-religious lifestyles onto these people , but you need to understand that 99 % of jihadis are ** true believers ** . 
  or maybe the native populations and their culture is what made them prosperous ? 
  portugal 's most richest time in recent history was during estado novo , and it did n't have a lot of liberal democracy involved . 
  the bigger the muslim population gets in europe the more these things will happen . 
  there 's literally no logical reason to presume otherwise . 
  it should n't matter , but the fact that a guy with 3 children could do something like this makes me more upset because i ca n't help but presume he probably is violent with them as well . 
  ca n't speak for everywhere , but here gypsies often take portuguese or spanish names . 
  i saw this on portuguese media yesterday and thought it was just some stupid kid messing with a chemistry set or something blown out of proportion . 
  12 years old ? 
  if this report is accurate his parents and every adult in his life needs to be investigated immediately . 
  diversity of thought is what makes europe great . 
  outside of your social circle i 'm sure there are many people who think quite differently than you about these things . 
  saying it makes someone a ` trump supporter ' or implying they are n't dutch because of it is quite insidious and you should feel ashamed of yourself . 
  could n't 1,100 be very close to ` natural ' applications otherwise . 
  does n't really seem to be indicative of anything other than a small % of every countries people seek employment/life abroad . 
  i 'm not czech so hopefully someone can correct me if wrong , but when i 've been there i was gambling in a ` private club ' that was basically a small casino . 
  you had to pay like 20 czech crowns to ` join the club ' and enter . 
  presuming it 's possible to do this for casinos , it 's probably very possible to do for smoking . 
  i 'm no russia fanboy but it 's the same with the monthly news snippets about ` russia forces on east ukraine border ' . 
  yeah , it 's a major population center and there is military bases there , so they move people in and out . 
  it would be like articles that canadian army is close to us border every month . 
  i understand they wan na keep people in touch with the donetsk conflict but it 's intentionally misleading and they never mentions that those army bases have had troops there for decades . 
  i 'm not a zealous hater , but the second half ushered in what was effectively a long slow 400 year war . 
  guess it depends on what angle you want to look at it all from . 
  the first half of 600-900 was cool , the second half not so much . 
   impersonating a minor should also be added to the list . 
  amen, 
  ` dont admit youre american or people will hate you ' , not exact quote but something like that . 
   i personally do n't get the gypsy hate . 
  99 % of gypsies i encounter here send their children to steal near cash machines or beg outside mcdonalds . 
  even most of our scummiest indigenous criminals do n't involve their children to that extent . 
  these gypsies are by far the most ` visible ' in our society , so it paints most peoples ' opinion . 
  well it 's 90 % muslim so they obviously do n't hate themselves . 
  yeah do n't do that in south portugal or we 'll think you 're a pansy and dishonest . 
  not every part of europe likes to jack off at how enlightened and anti-330 million people we are . 
  i always find it funny when people call the uk most racist and then try to reconcile it with the fact that it 's * still * the # 1 destination for poles and south asian muslims by an extremely high margin . 
  also the 2nd highest destination for oversea immigrating africans , after the us , which is also another funny conflict of narrative . 
  wow , incredibly bad hit piece . 
  yes , russia 's aircraft carrier is n't on par with french or us ones . 
  just about everything else in the article is hyperbole or outright lies . 
  i 'm so triggered i 'll make a list :  first , there is no military purpose : the carrier was designed to protect home waters , not for strike missions true it was n't designed for ` strike missions ' to some extent , but that does n't mean its ineffectual there . 
  furthermore , russia started using the carrier because they had issues with jihadis and sympathizers tipping off people in other parts of the country when russian jets took off from the various airfields . 
  the carrier strikes are a lot harder for jihadis to prepare for as civilians ca n't watch them take off from their backyard . 
   its distinctive `` ski jump '' prow is an admission of technological defeat -- because the deck lacks the catapults found on u.s. carriers , jets need the extra boost of the ramp to avoid toppling into the ocean . 
  the ` ski jump ' is n't really some ancient terrible technology . 
  spain , india and i 'm pretty sure most countries employ this method compared to the u.s. ships slingshot method . 
  i 'm 99 % sure uk 's ** brand new ** carrier also has it . 
   according to the trade website the aviationist , on saturday an su-33 flanker returning to the carrier crashed into the sea after failing to hook onto the deck-top `` arrestor cables '' that slow the jets upon landing . 
  this is n't evidence of bad tech , there 's literally about a dozen vids of this happening to top of the line us ships as well . 
  these things happen , albeit rarely . 
  none of that is evangelical . 
  it 's a real term and has an actual meaning other than what you 're saying . 
  some super lefty friend of mine , who is an ultra greenwald fan and was all aboard the ` fake news elected trump ' train , had an existential crisis when he read this article calling out his favorite papers lol . 
  i always am a bit envious of people who find these ancient things . 
  if reincarnation is real i hope i get to be an archaeologist in my restart , but hopefully without all that study and stuff - just digging and finding old statues and manuscripts . 
  i hate these false comparisons . 
  poland was also once europe 's premier muslim killers too . 
  poland owes it to us to march winged hussars into latakia and free the holy land right ? 
  if lithuanians were n't a bit selfish they 'd be an oblast and your state media would be in russian . 
  ah so there is exemption for lower income and it 's a static amount . 
  so for example a poor guy maybe only pays 100 of the 5000 , but a rich guy pays 5000 of the 5000 ? 
  interesting thks, 
  well what works for them is clearly that their diet is radically different . 
  i 'm not even sure eu fishing could sustain the amount of seafood needed if everyone was magically forced to adopt a japanese style diet .

  this mostly failed in the us and they stopped doing it afaik . 
  regardless , given what i know about netherlands and most countries that have large muslim populations i 'm pretty confident this will be the next step . 
  probably will result in a resurgence of private catholic schools in europe , ironically enough . 
  til boston , seattle , portland ( both !, 
  ) , el paso , are all rural . 
  a better analogy would probably be france annexing quebec or something . 
  crimea was almost 100 % russian speaking and the majority of people there were ethnic russians . 
  it 's not a stretch to say that a majority of crimeans were happy to join russia and gain russian citizenship . 
  i do n't have a problem with putin . 
  he makes rather intelligent geo-political maneuvers while dealing with a rather tense domestic situation . 
  he 's also proved to be a fairly generous statesman with regard to his allies . 
  i also enjoy that he was one of the only public leaders actually calling out the fsa for what they are - islamist jihadists that the eu indirectly support via us . 
  i do n't care if russia funds bad things too , i 'm at least glad someone is there to counter balance the eu/na hegemony when they pull off questionable shit like that in syria . 
  lastly , i question if it would be possible to run russia well without a character like putin at the helm . 
  i 'm not sure typical `` western '' style politicians would be able to manage things like chechens and counterbalancing us foreign influence as well to be honest . 
  it 's not like i think he deserves a nobel prize , but i think he does well enough for a person put into a very difficult situation . 
  i do n't know if you 're trying to be cheeky and obtuse , but [ this pic ] ( http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/74014000/gif/_74014185_nato_member_countries_624map.gif ) might make it more clear . 
  nato has been slowly expanding over the decades , and expanding eastwards toward russia . 
  furthermore us bases are within striking distance of eastern russia due to their cooperation with the japanese and korea . 
  if my neighbors started making a `` defensive alliance '' that continually built up arms and added more and more houses in the neighborhood to the alliance over time i 'd start wondering if the alliance is still a ` defensive alliance ' . 
  it 's easy to say of course the nato wo n't attack russia but that does n't mean it 's not a national security threat for russia either . 
  ei maybe a bit snarky on my part in re-reading , but ive holidayed many times in marseille and the algerian/muslim presence there is quite strong , almost feels a majority . 
  these people geneally are not fond of jews , and even if it 's a small portion i can understand how they feel uncomfortable in a place where so many women are docile hijabis and such . 
  it 's a hard thing to discuss without being offensive and i feel my comment is perhaps rude in retrospect , apologies for the tone . 
  i see you 've never visited beautiful marseille, 
  i do n't agree with your first points but this :  maybe we should just find away to manage a small population decline instead of purposefully and irrevocably changing the face of our nations ? 
  is something that i ca n't understand . 
  so many people seem to act like population decline is some doomsday scenario that is impossible to work through without importing people from other countries . 
  i 'm very confident that a country such as germany has the type of people who would be more than capable of efficiently downsizing their country and accommodating a lower population without experiencing a horrific economic depression . 
  every time someone argues about immigration people will say `` but birth rates are low !!!, 
  we need more people !!! '', 
  i remember in the 90 's the same type of people were complaining and warning that the world was overpopulated . 
  should n't it be a good thing if the global population goes down a bit ? 
   do people want to marry and have kids ? 
  nope and they 're not going to start as quality of life continues to increase . 
  introduction of widely available birth control is possibly one of the greatest changes to human society ever . 
  it will definitely be interesting moving forward . 
  i really do n't see birthrates ever going back up again unless there is some massive social shift . 
  more and more women are working full time and even in states with excellent maternity leave benefits it 's still unlikely that many will choose to have more than 1-2 children . 
  there 's even some futurist type scholars who are concerned that if vr and tech . 
  gets to the point that `` fake '' sex is more pleasurable than real sex it could be an existential crisis . 
  not that i personally agree , but it 's definitely an interesting and plausible ( imo ) scenario . 
  in their eyes they are the same thing , sorry about the confusion . 
  dunno if you 're being humorous , but lol yes . 
  the general jihadi/conservative sunni point of view toward alawites is that they are crypto-polytheists who 's simple existence is a constant expression of shirk ( idol worship ) . 
  they also generally declare them to be secretly working against `` real muslims '' and point to assad 's habit of appointing them to the highest bureaucratic positions in his government and generally higher level of wealth in syria accusing as proof of this . 
  some groups even claim they are secretly jews or christians pretending to be muslim , or at the very least practicing a syncretic faith . 
  they stay as low profile as possible . 
  the point of transit where they have the highest risk of failing their plan is actually the turkish/syrian border . 
  furthermore , with contemporary jihadi beliefs there really is n't any beef they have with turkey outside of the areas where kurds live and the very small alawite communities . 
  when i mouse over your flair it says `` fake country '' ... not just me right ? 
  i ca n't tell if it 's just bias from them both being major powers and the cold war stuff , but the us and russian anthems always strike me as a step above other countries . 
  maybe i overrate the us one cause the lyrics are quite badass imo . 
  watching forsberg clips is almost sad in a way . 
  i 'm very confident if he was healthy his whole career he 'd be considered a gretzky tier player today . 
  hmm . 
   german police have repeatedly stated there was no evidence of kidnapping or rape . 
  martin steltner , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office , told berlin 's rbb public radio on monday there were only indications of `` consensual sexual contact . '', 
  he did n't comment on whether the office would investigate alleged perpetrators for having sex with a minor , which can be punishable by law . 
  from the article . 
  i 'll be optimistic and presume perhaps they 're still building a case since he did n't comment . 
  thanks for the info !, 
   ( the age of consent in germany is not 13 ) this seems like the most important detail regardless of whether the ` story ' she told police is true or not ? 
  30 hours is a pretty long time to be gone , she had to either be at another family 's home , a hotel , or the house of the guy she was having sex with if he is an adult no ? 
  did the police release that the men she accused were minors as well or what ? 
  is there romeo laws in germany so that if the men were 17 it 's not a crime ? 
  sorry if you do n't know this , just curious . 
  it 's almost developing into a sad rule of thumb but generally in europe when you read an article that says something like this : `` property x , y , z damaged and police use tear gas / pepper spray at far-right protest in blabla city '' what it really means is that 20-50 neo-nazi 's or far-right people had a rally , and 100 antifa thugs showed up and instigated rioting or attacked random people and businesses . 
  they 're losing land in some places but also seem to be strengthening in the internal land they already control . 
  [ the deir-ez-zor offensive ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deir_ez-zor#syrian_civil_war ) is leading more toward a standstill but it looked like isis made a huge gain early in the siege . 
  if they manage to take the airfield it 's going to be a big problem . 
  it 'll be a bit more difficult i think to conduct airstrikes in isis territory if the assad govt loses complete control there , or so i read . 
  [ this is one of the more up to date maps ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/syrian_civil_war.png ) of the current situation and you can probably see why deir-ez-zor is important just by looking at it . 
  anyways , i do n't think isis really changes how frequently they try to tell people to go commit violence in europe . 
  they 're party line has basically always been `` come to ` sham ' ( aka the levant/iraq ) and fight with us , if this is impossible kill infidels in the west '' . 
  actually directly sending their troops away with orders is n't something they do and it 'd go against a lot of what they claim to be about . 
  furthermore , they need them more in iraq and syria anyways . 
  as a final note , it 's my personal opinion that the western media tends to exaggerate their territorial losses and under-report their gains unless it 's something really massive ( like the siege of mosul back in 2014 ) . 
  in many of those examples it could be argued that ` conflicts ' arose in those countries directly on account of pro-nato sentiment growing there . 
  russia 's current foreign policy is sort of centered around not allowing any bordering nations to join nato . 
  complete nonsense . 
  first of all in order to be halal the butcher must invoke god which is obviously offensive to many non believers . 
  second , surely there is a fair argument that slaughtering by bloodletting and not touching the animal until it has died of bloodloss is unncessarily cruel . 
  yeah , i was going to say there is almost no way that you ca n't request non-halal meat . 
  to be halal requires a specific butchering process that many would [ argue is torturous ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dhabihah ) . 
  personally i avoid halal meat out of moral principle . 
   why are n't the usual far-right people ( i mean hooligans and such ) go out for patrolling in those areas ? 
  i do n't know what country you 're in , but here you 're a lot more likely to meet antifa hooligans than right wing ones . 
  your comment is interesting to me because it makes me wonder if your predisposition in this case would have made you subconsciously complicit in a coverup were you a police officer in rotherham and a poor working class white family told you that some muzzies raped their kid ; as you may write them off as trashy racists mad that they have new brown neighbors . 
  i do n't mean this personally whatsoever and it 's not directly targeted at you but it was something i questioned when this story was first breaking out as well . 
  i think it 's a good thing personally . 
  if someone like milo y writes an article a huge portion of readers are going to immediately have a bias and expect the article to have a certain agenda . 
  with anonymous authors it 's up to the reader to attempt to detect any bias and criticize the article based on the merit of it 's content rather than the known views of the author . 
  this is probably sad to say , but i really feel like it 's a matter of time before wilders is assassinated as well . 
  presumably , that would only ramp up support more . 
  i 'm actually surprised there has n't been a serious attempt on his life already . 
  people keep talking about how bad sd is in this thread , but how bad can they be if they 're correct again about media censorship ? 
  i mean , they seem to be the only people fighting this establishment that is now corrupt beyond a reasonable doubt ( good intentions or not ) . 
  this is happening in euro countries all over and i do n't get it . 
  if the ` bad ' parties are the only one looking out for public safety than why the fuck ca n't the ` good ' parties get their shit together exactly ?

  are you seriously comparing those to abusive marriages with the backing of an entire community of bigots and fundies ? 
  that is pretty low . 
  how i wish people like you would reincarnate as gay women in these societies . 
  we dun goofed . 
  fundamentalist islam is much much worse than fundamentalist catholicism . 
  having experienced the latter first hand . 
  islam is by far the largest threat to democracy and rule of law . 
  it 's far more misogynistic and violent than anything else . 
  it 's more than religion . 
  it 's everything from economics , politics , law , food , clothing , hygiene and even fashion habits ... and it 's intolerant and virulent . 
  i hate all religion , but islam is the one that 's going to swallow europe whole . 
  obvious . 
  the overtaking company has access to capital and low interest rates . 
  if it were a greek owned company , they would n't get any loan whatsoever . 
  it 's funny how democracy seems to `` endanger '' everyone and bring about collapse . 
  those basic constitutional principles to which everyone here adheres to , are now seen as incompatible with the way society is restructuring itself . 
  maybe the social model being put forth by the eu is not really going to be better than it was and is a free fall from here . 
  benefitting only the wealthy elites . 
  why then continue such project ? 
  it 's obvious the people will reject it and will push to leave this false union . 
  careful . 
  the euro is not the dollar and could n't pull that off as well as the americans , being worlds reserve currency . 
  and the americans are stretching an already tight and chewed rope . 
  a good part of this crisis originated in the us and probably orchestrated as well . 
  they 're playing a dangerous double game . 
  a couple more years and all those alternate health cares will be merged together . 
  military adse and general public health . 
  and a couple years more after that they 'll be privatized and americanized . 
  old people will die and less money on pensions will be spent . 
  also , more people will flee the country as we regresse into the 1920s . 
  i think cape verde and east timor could have been kept as an autonomous regions , if they 'd chosen it and for their own benefit of course . 
  yes , but with rampant global warming and energy demands , it will be worth bickering about . 
  more power and control at the hand of the wealthy . 
  what has britain come to ... selling themselves off to zuckerberg and his ilks for a few coins in tax and the promiscuity ( illegal and immoral ) free access to any users accounts . 
  people have no idea the amount of money being made off of them and this new social media paradigm . 
  not to mention the dangerous path it 's leading us to , in the current economic crisis context . 
  tread carefully . 
  do n't even bother calling me a neo-luddite . 
  i doubt we 'll get involved militarily . 
  but after that whole regime is thrown , we 'll probably contribute to economically ease that people 's suffering . 
  i just do n't want to see or read about orange-suite prisoners being flown through our airspace . 
  guantanamo is a gross violation of human rights and while that shit hole exists , every muslim will have plenty hate and reason to target western interests . 
  if you want to discuss more important issues , then the whole japan-china islands dispute is several magnitudes more dangerous , interesting and complex . 
  bad times indeed for anything . 
  but the good times are n't coming back . 
  not without a market revolution or some kind of reset . 
  but i suspect economy dynamics has hit it 's peak and all that is left is a bumpy and fast fall . 
  competition is no longer what it used to . 
  the market tendency has been to concentrate . 
  look at the media example . 
  30 years ago things were more spread apart and competing . 
  same goes for cell and data communication ( isp ) . 
  car industry , food industry , big pharma , even audit and investment companies . 
  they all concentrate . 
  you see , bigger companies , like banks , to which they are tied , need to grow and the only space left is their competition . 
  remember banks were in lack of people borrowing and opened up the subprime loans . 
  same goes for large companies . 
  to them this is the logical next step but it 's going to end badly for us . 
  cartelization and being too big to fail , not to mention the huge legislative influence they have , through lobbying and political sponsoring or corruption ... 
  i could give many more examples . 
  there is n't any ideology behind what i 'm saying . 
  it 's just an observation of the obvious . 
  i disagree . 
  nationalisations can go wrong , much like anything in life . 
  but nationalisations are subject to democratic scrutiny or being called into question by political or even citizen opposition . 
  not to mention that it can be put to good use and ramping up the economy ( i.e , lowering fuel , energy and water prices to exporting companies or the socially troubled , low cost social transportation , health care for the poor ) privatization can go well but rarely does . 
  it is usually like a shroud being dropped on something . 
  the number of factions involved becomes much higher , as does the potential for corrupting any government or companies . 
  anything goes as long as maximum profit is attained . 
  and the sweetest targets are monopolies like water , energy , public transportation , etc. 
  the ones that do n't have much market competition . 
  and the ones the people and the companies ca n't really escape from . 
  not really a problem in light of the bigger social crisis . 
  in fact , pornographic incomes being earned , no matter what area , seem kinda representative of all that 's wrong with society . 
  privatization is a catalyst for social inequality and high-level/large scale fraud . 
  i am not communist !, 
  if only we had the work ethic of polar bears . 
  portugal and spain are very different . 
  while half of spain could n't care any less for nationalism , the other half certainly makes up for them . 
  in portugal , things are more toned down . 
  some might take this as due to being weak ... 
  if franco had gone through with his [ `` conquista '' of portugal in 24 hours ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/3373194/gen-franco-wanted-to-declare-war-on-portugal.html ) , all this would n't matter now !, 
  he most certainly would 've failed ... miserably !, 
  and spain might have become a portuguese province ( but we do n't really want that ) . 
  how about that , iberians ? 
  seriously ... the conquest of portugal in 24 hours ?!? 
  is that even possible without tactical nukes or high speed trains ? 
  luckily we are now prevented from all that since we created a fiendish toll system ( troll system ? ), 
  in our once simple highways and by devising a cryptic and absurd way to pay for them . 
  it involves broken payment machines and support lines to operators who do n't even speak english , let alone spanish . 
  all they 'd get is lengthy queues and blood clots in the brain from anger !, 
  oh and heat strokes !, 
  because there is no shade while waiting !, 
  really massive trolling by the government , if you ask me . 
  i pity any wannabe conqueror of portugal . 
  no , there are other disputes but they are dormant . 
  portugal disputes [ oliven\u00e7a ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olivenza ) with spain . 
  by law and by signed treaties , oliven\u00e7a is portuguese and had always been portuguese . 
  spain also disputes [ gibraltar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gibraltar ) and morocco disputes [ ceuta ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ceuta ) and [ melilla ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melilla ) with spain . 
  the portuguese [ savage islands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/savage_islands ) is disputed by spain .

  we 're not . 
  what job ? 
  heh , i actually feel sorry for the anti-americanism that goes on this thread , and i hope you do n't think ill of us all because of it . 
  but believing the us goes to war for righteous reasons is just being naive , sorry . 
  it 's not just the oil , mind you , you have to keep your entire military and construction industries active , too . 
  that 's a not a bold claim , really . 
  portugal is there , where the king is a puppet of the [ duke of saldanha ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jo%c3%a3o_carlos_saldanha_de_oliveira_daun,_1st_duke_of_saldanha ) . 
  but to be honest , at first i read britannia in the man 's hat . 
  would still make sense . 
  pretty much the same in portugal too . 
  but these are just labels to help the survey , who gives a shit about it other than that ? 
   agnostic means `` do n't give a damn '' , right ? 
  not at all . 
  agnostic means that you do n't believe something can be proven to be either true or false . 
  it can be related to deities , sure , but just as much as it can be related to singularities in the universe or wether reality shows are real or fake . 
  maybe i 'm just being too picky . 
  gnosticism is n't religion , it 's about being able to prove something . 
  message still goes trough in the survey anyway . 
  i wish you did n't put agnostic as a religious belief , but i understand it 's easier to do so . 
  edit : also , the ones about the us are going to be pretty to look at . 
  so what you are saying is that the swiss can not use the alps because they have seldom been invaded ? 
   plus : so you sit in your mountain hole while the enemy loots your cities and rapes your families . 
  then he starts rebuilding the country while you still sit there , watching your supplies run low . 
  great idea . 
  for what it is worth , the moors had some troubles in handling the asturian mountain range upon their complete conquest of the iberian peninsula , and guess [ what happened then ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reconquista ) . 
  but sure , medieval warfare versus modern warfare is n't really comparable . 
  i mean , there are airplanes , missiles , and whatnot . 
  it 's evident that mountains are no longer sufficient for an occupied people to do much about it , but if you look at the taliban and the afghanistan mountains , it can hurt the occupant . 
  * it is a confederation , divided into cantons . 
  * neutral in almost every european war there was ( and we 've had a lot ) , they have conscription , which means every men in the whole country would be able to fight if necessary . 
  that , and the alps , make it a goddamn fortress . 
  oh , and tanks in barns , too . 
  * the alps . 
  beautiful , beautiful , the best natural landscapes i 've seen in my travels . 
  * clockwork . 
  both the people and the actual clocks . 
  * swiss army knives , of course ( i wonder if the papal guard uses swiss army partisans ) . 
  * chocolates and cheese . 
  * cern . 
  * banks . 
  edit : pope guard uses partisans , not halberds . 
  to put it this way , it generally is n't tipping for good service that is frowned upon ; only when you try to put a price in simpathy can it be weird . 
  that said , tipping in restaurants is generally accepted , and the population is mostly divided . 
  i do n't usually tip , i know people who do . 
  so , it 's fine to tip a waiter , really . 
  so did you enjoy the francesinha ? 
  hah , rediscovering !, 
  i like you . 
  i think people often mistake it . 
  portugal is n't the oldest country , but it has the oldest ( not sure ) borders in the world . 
  continental borders have not changed since somewhere about the 14th century or so . 
   no heating in houses while true in the south , where the houses are painted white to help reflect sunlight in the summer , northern houses such as [ this ] ( http://ipt.olhares.com/data/big/130/1301742.jpg ) often had a barn on the ground level where people would place the cattle for the night which would , in turn , heat up the first floor , where people slept , from animal heat and a good fireplace . 
  how so ? 
  what does it mean in german ? 
  i was trying to point out that even if it does gets colder , the magnitude we 're talking about is one or , at most , two degree celsius . 
  that is , even if the summer is colder , it wo n't be cold . 
  so do n't worry , you 'll get 34 instead of 35 degrees !, 
  right , i missed the suspension part . 
  where did you get this list ? 
  because / u/jsn86 is correct , the big one is n't 25 de abril . 
  as far as food goes , what mostly matters is the climate , and we have [ mediterranean climate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mediterranean_climate ) . 
  of course , however , as / u/oidaoyduh pointed out , we also have a lot of influence from our colonies . 
  most of us really do n't like getting extra money for being helpful . 
  doing something like that is already very rewarding for us . 
  for example , one night out , my sister lost her purse . 
  the following day , some girl called me ( as it had her cellphone in it ) and , after some arrangements , we met somewhere so she 'd give her the purse . 
  it had everything in it , nothing was gone , and my sister tried to give her some euros to pay for the gas she spent , but she vehemently refused it . 
  and we did n't insist , because that 's just how it works . 
  it can actually be insulting to be given money for being friendly , but we generally disregard that as just a `` he did n't know better '' thing . 
   used to be fascist , got rid of the dictator using carnation flowers haha , if you put it that way it sounds like an amazing conversation theme !, 
  `` so how did that go , he was emotionally touched by a bouquet of flowers or what ?! '', 
  i guess ` the ' is n't a good word to use there ? 
  i 'd like to point out that this is n't true . 
  there are some probabilities that the weather will be less than one degree celsius colder , but climatologic predictions can not be taken as precise . 
  we 're still in spring , and the temperatures are reaching almost 30 \u00b0 c in some places . 
  nevertheless , we are currently experiencing several semi-periodic polar fronts ( cold ) which explains why sometimes temperature goes down by almost 10 \u00b0 c. 
  we 'll be getting another one of those northern buggers next week , too . 
   the latest seasonal forecast of the portuguese institute of sea and atmosphere ( ipma ) , released on the 17th of may , speaks of values that can be between 0.2 and 0.5 degrees celsius below average across the mainland , between june and august . 
  if the accounting period is from july to september , the fall in temperature applies only to north and centre of the country .

  unfortunately , [ this ] ( http://franciscosoeiroblender.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/111.jpg ) is awful to walk on , specially on rainy days , because you slip all the time . 
  also , since they are all manually built , they 're not very levelled , and you get quite the bumpy ride one step to another . 
  i understand muslims were also targeted by the holocaust , but what exactly is there to offend them ? 
  yes , i was really surprised at that map that showed google maps coverage of europe , and germany was also very much uncovered . 
  it seems you germans really do not like communication technology . 
  not entirely correct , but very close . 
  the land is rising because the isostatic balance of the lithosphere has not yet been restored since the last ice age . 
  it 's not that the land is compressed like , say , a sponge , but the weight of the ice pushed the land downward and the mantle has not yet fully raised it back . 
  in other words , a wooden boat being pushed down and coming back to the surface , on a geological time scale . 
   threat customers better than us youth problems ?

  i do n't really know much about its history , because it was never relevant to my own country 's history , but i know it is a most beautiful place i would very much like to visit , and that it ( or , well , scandinavia as a whole ) is one of the few places on earth the sea level is falling . 
   false friends did not know what that was called .

  [ on the other hand ... ] ( http://news.asiantown.net/r/29948/swedish-man-di--101-s-after-se--120--with-wasp-nest ), 
  i do n't have anything interesting to say ; the map looks like the portuguese flag . 
  what exactly is the sick man label ?

  i 'd be very proud romania managed to shoulder with poland as a benchmark for east europe . 
  uhh ... ... ... ... ... . . 
  okay , i wo n't bite . 
  let 's just leave it at that , had no idea austrians could be so thick . 
  i was planning on visiting vienna but you and your country mates have single handedly made me reconsider and just visit something equally nice . 
  your point is being deliberately pedantic , preying on the ` weak ' just to impress a bunch of circlejerking high horses . 
  portugal is irrelevant in a broader stage ( sadly ) , romania is not . 
  period . 
  i wo n't give more hungry hungry hippos validation points , so please keep on with your my action man is cooler logic . 
  this is literally about hungary and romania , you humongous tit . 
  who the fuck contests romania up against heavy weight germany ? 
  got ta love the backtrack , as i was brought up being irrelevant and not having much power are two completely different concepts . 
  got ta get your social standing back on track in order not to lose any karma - chicken tendies are expensive these days holmes . 
  lol . 
  you mean 20 million people , important nato partner who polices the black sea , growing gdp , company profit heaven , oil and gas provider for eastern and central europe , educated workforce who , among other things , were the forefathers of flight romania ? 
  we swear like sailors though . 
  it 's incredible how little i swear in my two other languages , once i think about it . 
  no man , i meant nordics getting paid to patrol south italy ? 
  such a sacrifice, 
   also i doubt poles and swedes will want to stay guard at italian costs and keep out the illegal african immigrants heh . 
  oh , you 're serious ? 
  that sounds pretty freaking uncomfortable to be honest . 
  it 's not i 'm boring but i have a real aversion to drugs . 
  i do n't think it 's morally wrong , but it 's ... unhappy . 
  you 're too logical and not racist enough for this sub reddit . 
  please leave but first take my respect, 
  it 's impossible to get by nowadays . 
  either stop paying attention to the gargantuan cowards who have never had to go without food for more than 8 hours complaining about dirty immigrants , or unsubscribe . 
  unfortunately , no one will pay attention to your comment . 
  the world evolves and so does immigration . 
  the immigrants coming to europe are n't coming over to take over like the ottomas , they 're coming for a better life . 
  like ... oh , i do n't know the european settlers of america . 
  freakin ' irish are still ruining america to this day , as are all the blacks , italians ... 
  it seems to be very hard to get this across to a bunch of nitwits though . 
  where would n't they . 
  i would pay to see genuine sources for that piece of bullshit . 
  i know , but for future reference it 's valid . 
  it 's difficult to allocate heavy budget for that , right away, 
  was it a nice , or artesenal , restaurant or just a house with some plastic chairs outside ? 
  that sounds impossibly cheap :( if it was that cheap , i 'd live in my dear native portugal right now . 
  that sounds really freaking amazing , i 'd love more day !, 
  summers until 9 pm are not enough :(, 
   porto is great for portugal if you want seaside . 
  nah dude , porto does n't have fantastic seaside in my opinion . 
  just before algarve , you have the costa alentejana . 
  that 's my favorite , the beaches are awesome and it 's cheaper/less crowded by steaks ( what we call the brits that come every summer and get bright red sunburns ) . 
  second on the transylvania part , i love the mountain . 
  it 's awesome to go hiking there , and even the black sea is pretty nice . 
  i need to check the danube delta as well but damn is it far . 
  where the fuck did you go and when ? 
  as much i 'd like to say otherwise , do not listen to this dude . 
  a meal like that in current days will set you back 10 to 15 euros . 
  coffee in lisbon is * not * 40 cents . 
  i agree with the bulgarian , as a portuguese . 
  sure for west europe prices we have insanely cheap prices all the big earners love to salivate at . 
  now , bulgaria is just something else . 
  when i went , i bought * real leather and fur * winter boots for 20 euros . 
  i had a full meal for less than 5 euros and i got drunk off 50 cent spicy rum . 
  does n't explain this community 's hatred for immigration . 
  i am very pro-immigration and i have n't met a portuguese of my generation who does n't have black , indian , other european friends , and is openly anti-immigration either . 
  but i stress - i ** agree ** that hundreds a day is not a fantastic idea . 
  people will die , i know . 
  it 's awful and we ca n't help it . 
  what we can do is take number across europe we can accommodate , and heavily invest and help large neighboring african countries such as algeria to modernize and help carry the humanitarian aid weight . 
  to be fair i judge serbians as cheeky funny bastards and hungarians and czech as butthurt xenophobic trolls because of this sub . 
  urgh , this fucking post . 
  point 1 - are you really comparing refuges from * africa * to gypsies ? 
  point 2 - you live in a multi cultural world and czech republic is not a special snowflake . 
  point 3 - implying other immigrants are organized to cause real problems , lol point 4 - just forget it , i wo n't even address the atheistic nonsense . 
  what a terrible , terrible post . 
  i do n't check / r/europe so much anymore and every time i do , i leave with a piece of turd in my mouth . 
  it kind of does , if they eventually go back to their home country . 
  but in order for that to happen , they need said country to evolve so they can go back , use the skills they learned here and open the door for a modern country . 
  except you forget the part that in order to save our european bacon , we need to help the arabs solve their issues or face hardship . 
  europe exists to prosper , and in order to do so you need a stable , contributing global economy . 
   the biggest example of ethnic cleansing was that of the 12 million ** germans and german speaking people ** come again ? 
   young males bares lots of potential for conflict . 
  i think this is the main reason this sub is so afraid of immigrants . 
  they 're young males , and as sheltered young males themselves they feel terrified of conflict . 
  they go out in public , lower their head when walking past a ` brown ' person eating street food , furiously typing on their phones how uncivilized these uncultured masses of ` islamists ' are due to their inner fear of confrontation . 
  how 's it like being a crackpot ?

  although , i turn yellowish in the winter . 
  it 's weird , must be a mediterranean thing . 
   estonia is the highest producer of fashion models per capita an american chick i dated was the daughter of a former model , who - you guessed it - was estonian-ukranian . 
  her mom was just stunning , super classy lady . 
  also super freaking nuts . 
   which comes from debt from greek government . 
  that 's not how it works , ya tit . 
  greece is a tertiary economy , they are n't industrial but they contribute with tourism , services and they have a big significance in sea trade . 
  and i believe that answers your half baked question . 
  because of the sheer ridiculousness of it . 
  romania once brought a homoerotic dubstep vampire . 
  serbia sent an actual cherubim who had way too much angel hair pasta this year . 
  epic sax man was from eurovision . 
  it 's just really fun to kick back and laugh at . 
   like ... did anyone vote for conchita because of the song ... ? 
  no mate , it was total shit did n't sound like a fucking bond theme at all must have been the fokin beard .

  well , fuck you to , you leprechaun drunkards . 
  i would rather be called fascist slaver lazy leech than that . 
  i 'm ok with that , 
  do you also pronounce `` eu '' as `` io '' like those spanish traitors of romania ? 
  not hitler but more ~ ~ nazi ~ ~ germany that fallowed hitler . 
  ftfy, 
  you spanish whores !, 
  i think that was more regarding public baths , as they would have multiple people naked . 
  at least in portugal it is said that people toke baths quite often and that most houses had baths in it . 
  there 's also a lot o medieval pictures that shown that . 
  `` bunch of whiners '' ... we have a winner . 
  yes , most houses had a bath and because every one lived near a river water was n't something that was scarce , so you could toke as many bath as you like . 
  even regarding washing clothes there were a long tradition of washing them almost daily by women in the river . 
  that remain in the first half of the 20th century , prior to people move in masses to the cities . 
  in true galician is * cuarta-feira * !!!, 
  be a good catholic and remove all that paganism of your calendar that your castillians overlords force you to have . 
  use the right terms that were used prior to our independence , so they were use by both our people . 
  follow the lesson of s\u00e3o martinho de dume and get rid of that sinful pagan symbolism . 
  every time you use * m\u00e9rcores * saint james weeps a single tear . 
  actually , romans put baths in prominence in their culture . 
  you can always find public baths and lavatories in roman ruins through out the empire . 
  also for the arabs baths were of extreme importance in their culture . 
  so baths in the iberian culture at least were of extreme importance and people toke them quite often even in the middle ages , although they started to be taken at home instead of communal bath , since christian moral viewed those public baths as a indecency . 
  day ** s ** , you uncivilized beast . 
  that 's what being too far north for the romans gets you . 
  you are right . 
  i just glanced and did n't saw that the finns and estonians were in the same shade of blue . 
  bath day ? 
  you dirty nordics !, 
  easy there , russian fella . 
  rappers . 
  it has better lyrics than the actual anthem . 
  investment in banks so people could build more houses than it was needed . 
  other than that very little investment was made . 
  the euro was not beneficial for us . 
  i was think more north korea . 
  at least they know how to put a show . 
  it should be the other way around . 
  you need to be close to each other to share the warm . 
  yeah , that would be the ideal solution . 
  but i do n't think it will happen . 
  the blunt of the euro crisis has passed . 
  italy , spain , portugal and ireland are on the right track and their debts will soon be manageable . 
  if the period where those reforms where more needed did n't unite ez countries to make them , i do n't see any political will to implement such policies in the future . 
  misery and poverty we have plenty now . 
  the fact that escudo is not very valuable is actually good for the type of economy we have ( based on small service , tourism and small industry [ quality shoes , quality clothes , etc. ] ) . 
  it will help our exports , while not hurting our internal consumption ( we do n't have money too consume foreign products anyhow , you do n't see people buying new cars or changing iphones every year ) . 
  our major problem would be oil import , but we are already one of the leading european countries on renewable energies , so we can minimize that . 
  this would allows us to combat our biggest social-economical problem : unemployment . 
  the standard of living will not improve , since money would be less valuable , but we now can have more people with jobs by * de facto * cutting workers ' wages without them losing the basic standard of living ( there 's a reason why germany does n't increase wages , despite continually making billions in the euro-crisis ) . 
  also we would be tie free from most of germany/france economical policies , allowing us to address internal crisis in the best way for us , even if that goes against their interests . 
  people need to understand that for a country like portugal joining the euro was only a good economical idea so we could get cheaper ratings on loans to combat our economical delay that almost half a century of a fascist dictatorship put us in . 
  that proved to be more nefarious than good , and we can no longer boost our infrastructure like that , so there 's no point in remain in the euro . 
  hope he gets elected . 
  he 's one of the few practical , non-theoretical , leaders of a left party in a major european country . 
  you play the game with weapons that you have at your disposal . 
  i really hope than in 10/15 years , after we repay most of ( private ) bank 's debts we were forced to assume , that we leave the ez so we can get our country back on tracks . 
  hopefully in the meantime we would keep investing in alternative energies so buying energy would be such a burden then . 
  exactly the same in portugal . 
  anyone wrights in cursive , although no-one calls it this specific term , until like 11 or 12 y/o . 
  then teachers stop caring about this and everyone develops their preferences in writing , more often than not combing printing style with the cursive .

  i 'm not drinking some hot water with leafs in it . 
  let me get my ship and navigate across the globe to get the real shit '' . 
  no nobody fucks with russia ... [ ^ ^ ^ yeah , ^ ^ ^ right ] ( http://cdn3.image.bored.com/thumbnails/because-russia__zero.jpg ),

  when you kill your political opposition in broad daylight near the parliament you send a strong message to everyone involved in russia . 
  you can call it that to , although the first is more appropriate since it is a heraldry symbol and that 's the word you should use in english .

  an hour after they blitzkrieg france , berlin would be erased from the map for some hundred thousand years . 
  a political movement . 
  one that goes to streets , starts debate in the public opinion and push their political agenda . 
  that is a dozen of people that share an idea and want to get together . 
  not what i was referring to . 
  i 'm an iberian since i 'm from the iberian peninsula . 
  but i do n't want to share in any way shape of from be share the same country with people from spain . 
  we can push for cooperation between the countries , like the benelux , and the european union project show that border and countries can not stop people for cooperating with each other . 
  but that does n't mean we need an iberian union to do that . 
  to each their own land . 
  you have to understand that talk about union coming from a spaniard is always something that portuguese ( in general ) will be very skeptical about . 
  we just need to look to our northern border to see how , even in a democratic spain of the 21st century , their identity is always threatened , even their own ( official ) language butchered . 
  had discussions with tones of spaniards , and the talk of iberian union often comes up , always this let 's complete spain , let 's get the missing part . 
  and always the capital is madrid , always the language is castillian , even for most the political system must be a monarchy , with the spanish king at the helm ( of course ) . 
  i bet you that does n't happen when spaniards go to france , you know your other neighbours , that you share a common language , cultural and religion . 
  try do guess why ? 
  there 's no practical reason for portugal to be united with spain . 
  none whatsoever . 
  we would lose the ability to decide our future for what ? 
  to became a minority in spain ? 
  the rest of the idealistic dream of iberianism has been already achieved with our inclusion in the eu and the schengen treaty . 
  you can freely study , live , work , marry , etc.

  obviously they are going to where the money is . 
   are you claiming that all refugees are stealing , throwing away food , etc. ? 
  straight to the straw-man tactics , not once did i say that ** all ** the migrants are doing this but judging from the video evidence in multiple countries at multiple times , it is not an isolated thing . 
   it 's that most people who have these radical and ignorant opinion on reddit are american . 
  yes , i know it 's a pretty biased and small sample , but it fits to reddit . 
  on an american website , the majority of the people are americans , next you will be telling me that in austria there are lots of austrians , unbelievable . 
  like i said , you are an ideologue , there is nothing short of experience that can change your mind , and even then you would find a way to justify whatever [ conflicts ] ( http://i.imgur.com/haj0gct.gifv ) with your world-view . 
   this refugee crisis might fail so hard that the political backlash will be a very strict and possibly xenophobic immigration policy for europe in the coming decades . 
  i fear that the nice prosperous and tolerant europe that we know and love is gone forever , either those in favour of mass immigration get their way and blend europe into some islamic concoction or europeans become closed and hostile . 
   safety is n't everything . 
  you still need to eat , drink and sleep somewhere . 
  so very true , it is a shame that hungary , austria , germany and denmark are unable to look after these people . 
  someone should do titeuf holding his nose up at the hungarians , austrians , germans and dutch saying `` pas assez bon '' ( google translate , do n't hurt me ) . 
  if video evidence of these people stealing , throwing away food and demanding to pass through to places were they can get the best welfare is n't enough then nothing but time will teach you the error of your ways . 
  cnn does n't do propaganda subtle i see . 
   entitlement from what i 've seen this is in no short supply . 
   it seems safe to assume that the 200 million scenario simply wo n't happen ; the width of the mediterranean alone makes that hard to imagine , to say nothing of what 's likely to happen in european domestic politics . 
  ** but then if you had predicted a few years ago that germany would be accepting hundreds of thousands , and possibly millions , of mostly-muslim refugees during a single period of crisis , that would have seemed fairly implausible as well ** . 
  and ** this crisis does n't have to repeat itself exactly to set a precedent that attracts the young , the adventurous , the ambitious , and the wired-in and social-media-savvy ** from countries ** where they might do well enough if they stayed , but where no matter how they worked and saved they could never hope to have it as good as the average european . 
   during a period in which the mexican population doubled , growing by about 60 million people , an additional 10 million ( on a net basis ) migrated to the united states . 
  applying comparable ratios to africa and europe , between now and 2050 nearly 200 million africans would be expected to migrate to europe . 
  between one in four and one in five europeans would be african immigrants . 
  nice . 
  a year before 9/11 .

  it doesnt matter how scary headlines you have about murder or rape , crime is decreasing . 
  so its not true that people throw grenades at each other in certain swedish cities ? 
  i see your american talking about sweden and i 'll raise you a muslim/exmuslim ? 
  in sweden talking about [ sweden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xg30xdmz8q ) . 
  must be american humour . 
  its a german flag . 
   zimbabwe can confirm , former resident of said country . 
  it 's hard to imagine that once it was 8 to 1 with the australian dollar and this was about 15 years ago . 
   and we are talking about 20,000 over 5 years . 
  how do you know this ? 
  nobody said last year that 800,000 would come this year , numbers could be more or less ( heh ) so countries could very well take in much more than the 160,000 that was first bandied about . 
  what 's to say that 2 years from now the big economies say they have too much and opt out of the quota for a few years ?

   i 've read so many just blatant lies in the last few days about germany on here its sickening ... 
  it could be that what the german politicians are saying is targeted at the domestic audience , but there is a much much wider group paying attention and western media like to spin the stories to their own narratives .

  i thought you guys wanted the diversity , why the scramble to spread it around ? 
  and frances plan to get rid of ~ ~ gaddafi ~ ~ assad will fix everything right ? 
  the guy is a racist with an agenda . 
  i was just commenting on the hypocrisy of it . 
   germany can deal with several million syrian refugees demographically , but ** it ca n't necessarily deal with the long-term outcomes . 
  ** so ** it is precisely because of this risk that the change is so impressive . 
  **  in the name of justice and morality , in the name of the desire to give humans freedom , ** germany is taking a huge gamble . 
  it may be committing suicide . 
  ** the far ** right will gain power ** , the immigrants will have an influence , ** the country will change . 
  ** so he recognozes that this will make germany/europe move more to the right and yet he still sees it as a good thing , why ? 
   in the past few years i have met german politicians and cooperated with german academics - and yet something has gone wrong in my system . 
  ** when i meet a german person i ca n't help but think about the origin of his family , and there is not a single time i hear german without thinking about the murderous voices my family members heard seven decades ago . 
  ** this is why , it might also be why [ this woman does it aswell ] ( https://youtu.be/mfe0qaiofmq?t=39s ), 
   if the israeli government would have been able to think first , netanyahu - like begin at the time - would have offered to take in several hundred druze or christians are temporary residents , not more , ** for the photo opportunity and the image . 
  ** some callous shit right there . 
   israel ca n't take in refugees now - and could n't take in refugees in the past either . 
  ** the demographic threat is real ** , and the need to preserve the jewish nation state 's character as a democracy does n't allow for large minorities . 
  and yet it is perfectly fine to offload african refugees onto sweden . 
  eu : `` borders , what are those ? '', 
   integrate and interbreed white women are only good as girlfriends , the wives must be good muslim girls from back home . 
   the fine line distinguishing `` military experts '' from trainers or troops capable of taking direct part in combat has added to western worries . 
  was n't the `` west '' sending trainers to ukraine ? 
   in before countless comments raging about how we give refugees actually decent places to live . 
  and those `` refugees '' will turn their noses up at this and go to where they get more benefits . 
   they 're coming because they want germoney .

   you think insulting people in an institution devoted to civil discourse is a good thing ? 
  most parliamentarians behave like spoilt brats . 
   serious question ( even if not very seriously worded ) , which country can we flee to before western europe is turned to shit by the oncoming onslaught of ( the following statement is relative ) uncultured , uneducated , very religious , barbaric people about to set back the development of our economy and culture by 300 years ? 
  israel , strict immigration policy even going so far as to send african migrants to europe . 
  we will probably have to rename the place , kingdom of jerusalem sounds nice . 
  september has been a good month for drama . 
  that young man , reality did n't live up to the hype . 
   but i forgot that european architecture now means soulless concrete blocks and big glass windows . 
  i despise what passes for `` culture '' these days , basically if its ugly or inscrutable but preferably both then it 's `` art '' . 
   the eritrean who confessed to the ikea murders in vasteras , sweeden recently where he knifed a mother and her son to death using ikea knives has said that he only committed the murders because the migration board decided that he would be deported to italy . 
  probably get a slap on the wrist . 
   curiosity , is there a dialogue to absorb cultural developments from brazil ? 
  or is brazil looked down upon with nothing to learn from in portugal ( or is my terminology so off ? 
  i do n't hear about the luthosphere here in aus ? 
  i grew up in africa watching skippy and listening to fado , and then emigrated to australia . 
  :p probably have to ask a real portuguese about that one . 
   i still feel like we 're culturally poor and need to absorb as much as we can from other countries . 
  in regards to this i feel that australians have their own uniqueness , time will take care of the rest . 
  what do the dutch call a pole in the water , a swimming pool . 
  not a very informative source then . 
  hue hue hue . 
  fort hood , the government call 's it workplace violence . 
  where is the source for the graph and is there one for the preceding years ? 
   the us was pretty successful with the integration of people from muslim countries , which shows that it is possible if done right . 
  the us gets to choose which muslims go there and even then there are still ~ ~ terrorist attacks ~ ~ workplace violence . 
  mr. k. should focus on the root cause of this nationalism , the only way to cure it is to of course remove humanity .

  i never noticed it until i was playing gta iv , turned on one of the russian stations and thought it was portuguese music .

  hungary is also europe 's porn capital and according to a famous map , hungarians have the longest penises among europeans . 
   please , do elaborate about who started the whole backstabbing . 
  now , that 's the kind of reply i wanted to attract . 
  our first king did . 
  we used to be `` spanish '' , remember ? 
   slavery is horrible but you forget it was common practice even amongst the enslaved . 
  that does n't make it an acceptable thing . 
  portugal was the first european nation to enslave africans and start something that did n't exist up 'til that point : transatlantic slave trade . 
  it became a common practice with the portuguese . 
   basically when england adopted the idea of raiding the french countryside , killing and stealing everything and burning down what was left as a long-term strategy . 
  not just france . 
  there 's a beach near where i live ( north of portugal ) called `` the english beach '' aka `` the thieves ' beach '' . 
  apparently , you guys used drop anchor there and do all kinds of despicable things to the local population on your way home . 
   hands downs the portuguese succession crisis of 1580 . 
  it was downhill ever since . 
  really ? 
  hands down ?!, 
  a molested kid who died in battle ?!, 
  fuck the slave trade and dooming the whole african continent to misery up to this day , right ? 
  that 's nothing compared to a succession crisis , i see . 
   some dark moments in portugal 's history are : the 1755 earthquake , as a serious blow to the people and the empire and removed lisbon from it 's european relevance ; how is a natural disaster something to be ashamed of ? 
  did we handle it badly like hurricane katrina ? 
   spain 's backstabbing has been a constant and is greatly imbued in popular culture . 
  we like the spanish people very much , we just do n't trust their leaders intentions . 
  i do n't think we trust ours as well ... `` de espanha , nem bons ventos nem bons casamentos '' which translates as `` from spain comes neither good winds/omens nor good unions '' that 's way beyond the point of discussion . 
  besides , do you want to know who started the whole backstabbing ? 
  to those interested , starting transglobal slave trade is hands down the most shameful moment in portugal 's history followed by the colonial war , a repercussion of the first event . 
  portugal 's glory was accomplished thanks to 4 centuries of an estimated 12 million slaves taken from africa and brought to europe and the americas . 
  this whole succession episode related by u/khthon is laughable compared to the real damage done by the slave trade carried out by my country in the past . 
  such episode resulted in 40 years of spanish rule ; the slave trade 's consequences are still visible everyday . 
  of all the examples in the world you had to choose press ? 
  seriously , press ? 
  i loved it like most kids did back then . 
  i still remember watching it every friday night and then it just stopped . 
  europe cold use these games now more than ever . 
  did n't the separatist candidate lose in the last local ( pardon me if this is not the right term ) elections ? 
  you do realize that canada is already a federal state itself , right ? 
   before you consider them as sub human waste ? 
  let 's not put words in my mouth . 
  i do not consider anyone a sub human waste . 
  their culture , on the other hand , is deplorable . 
   it then follows there are no such roma who have both no ties to this culture , and are discriminated against i 've seen some reports of roma who live successful lives outside their culture . 
  they are , however , highly discriminated by other roma people , even by their closest relatives . 
   look , you 're a racist . 
  your racism might be justified , i do n't know , but do n't dress it up as anything but . 
  look , i 'm not a racist , far from it . 
  i do n't even know if you actually understand what the word racism means , which is discrimination based on a person 's racial traits , like skin color and whatnot . 
  i embrace multiculturalism and truly enjoy experiencing other cultures . 
  i have friends and neighbors from different parts of the world , with different beliefs , languages and skin color . 
  you have no idea what racism is . 
  like someone else pointed out already , you have to experience it to know what the real problem is . 
  that bbc documentary is a good entry point but do come by to see the real thing . 
  our dear american followers should watch this so they could get a glimpse of why europeans `` seem to '' have such disdain towards gypsies instead of just throwing around words like racism and antiziganism . 
  i live in portugal but the scenario seems to be the same all over the continent . 
  gypsies around here are violent and vindicative people that insist on going against the rest of society . 
  the portuguese government actually pays them to get their kids to school ( they receive a minimum wage for each kid , if i 'm not mistaken ) despite the dropout rate among the community being astonishingly high ( they never make it past the age of 12 and the girls ' situation is even more astonishing ) . 
  education is looked down upon in their community and very , very few actually get a college degree despite that implying being an outcast to the rest of the community , including their own family and other close relatives . 
  i friend of mine used to teach english to 3rd and 4th graders and it was impossible to do so with more than a gypsy kid in the classroom . 
  they distract the other kids , interrupt the teacher and their parents just storm into the classroom to pick up their kids whenever they want . 
  it 's a nightmare . 
  in lisbon they have a long lasting feud with some african communities that result in a few murders and burned cars every year . 
  the sad thing is , and the one most americans do n't seem to get , these are not punctual cases and these do not happen only in portugal . 
  r/europe is often seen as a place of antiziganism and defenders of `` fortress europe '' which ca n't be farther from the truth . 
  people do not discriminate gypsies because of their skin tone or the way they talk ; it 's all about a culture based on thieving , murdering and , overall , chaos . 
  try to find any info you might be looking for [ here . 
  ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/crime_trends_in_detail ) the uk is , by far , the most violent country in the european union and one where they may be as much dark haired as light haired people . 
  take your own conclusions . 
  [ here 's the homicide rate in the eu . 
  ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/1/18/homicide_rate_per_100_000_population%2c_average_per_year%2c_2007-2009.png ) and no , blond people are not more violent than dar haired people . 
  there 's no connection between hair color and violence , that 's absurd . 
  i would if i could but it 's bloody expensive to travel by car . 
  this is unfortunate . 
  hopefully things will turn around and some of these villages can be converted in areas for rural tourism . 
  no correlation with hair color whatsoever . 
  it 's actually amazing how much equal these groups are . 
  someone should make a social article on this subject , i 'm not joking . 
  they look and act like the typical british hooligan and the girls are exactly like vicky pollard . 
  it 's quite strange how such subculture exists all over europe and they all look and act the same . 
  americans are usually oblivious to the european problem with gypsies . 
  i watched american gypsies on ng the other day but it does n't even come close to what 's going on here . 
  not just the dutch government , it 's the same thing in portugal . 
  gypsy families are paid per kid to send them to school . 
  nevertheless , very few gypsies finish mandatory school ( 12th grade ) and go to a university afterwards . 
  it 's actually looked down upon within their community . 
  that 's some twilight zone stuff . 
  it 's in the other chart at 19,4 % . 
  now i 'm doubting the whole thing . 
  the vast majority of those are not common at all . 
  alvarez , for example , is a spanish surname . 
  very few portuguese have that name . 
  i do n't know , there are some portuguese names that would have come before almeida , like abreu or abrunhosa . 
  weird , never would have guessed almeida was the most common surname in portugal . 
  smith ( which is ferreira around here ) is also quite common in portugal . 
  silva and costa are , by far the most common surnames in portugal and for historical reasons : those were the names given to foreigners who settled here with names too complicated to be kept . 
  they 'd be given the name costa if they decided to live by the coast ( which means costa ) and the name silva if they settled in the country ( silva means bramble , a plant often found in the country ) . 
  it 's almost impossible to find a portuguese family without any of those two names somewhere .

  getting paid by uk standards ( for instance ) and living in portuguese standards is the best of two worlds . 
  we get paid like shit here :(, 
  oh my god i love this joke . 
  dutch in portuguese is `` holand\u00eas '' . 
  no , it is a religion , one that states , at least , that wine is forbidden , freedom is only for those who speak the words and have a dick , peace will only exist when all follow it . 
  but civility , sure , they were the prime civilisation in the world in the year 1000 . 
  ca n't say i knew either , i was thinking chains in the roads as well :|, 
  i 'm on mobile and at work so i do n't have the time to search for a better source at the moment , but here 's a similar , very recent news for germany 's case : http://qz.com/680661/germany-had-so-much-renewable-energy-on-sunday-that-it-had-to-pay-people-to-use-electricity/, 
   often times more than 100 % that has to be exported for free to spain . 
  if their net is also at high capacity we actually have to pay them to take our energy as we have no one else to give it to ... 
  it 's okay , we get our winds and rivers from spain and there 's nothing they can do about it !, 
  the portuguese also introduced firearms to japan which pretty much changed the course of japanese history . 
  oda nobunaga himself used them . 
  i understand what you mean that they did not get the same level of influence or control from european nations , yes . 
  it was one of the few countries that remained adamantly independent . 
  but that was also a consequence of european influence as the japanese began then a period of isolationism . 
  there are plenty of japanese words with portuguese origins ( [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glossary_of_japanese_words_of_portuguese_origin ) ) . 
  does that not count for some influence ? 
  i 'll have you know america has the best american italian food in america !, 
  no need explaining , you just ca n't get it . 
  that sentence litterally means `` put butter on the spinaches '' , and i guess it 's an idiom meaning `` put bread on the table '' or simply `` bring more cash in '' . 
  but thing is , the way you said it can be read as `` she became a prostitute to get more in the pussy '' . 
  edit : just googled `` add a little extra to the kitty '' . 
  turns out it actually is an idiom meaning almost the same . 
  okay , learn everything every day . 
  i also have a dirty mind :(, 
   la fillon becomes a prostitute in the palais royal gardens to add a little extra to the kitty . 
  ca n't tell if badly translated or just censoring that last word . 
  ah fair enough , cheers . 
  op , why is santos silva in your posts title when the article is talking about ant\u00f3nio costa ( the pm ) and there 's no mention of the fa minister ?

  things are changing nowadays , tho . 
  it 's not just that . 
  it pretty much helped change the paradigm that all was well in god 's ( white ) world . 
  if one of europe 's most powerful cities could fall so easily and so unpredictably , what else could happen ? 
  descartes himself made a text out of it . 
  that 's not the point , you still never say ` the ' for city names . 
  in any case , it would be port wine , here ... 
  i can understand what you 're saying , but for the love of god never drive in rome . 
  i was there last week and they do not have any rules .

  we were neutral and `` helped '' both sides : http://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/10/world/nazi-gold-and-portugal-s-murky-role.html, 
  on a global scale , at least . 
  which is why we were not in ww2 . 
  brazil . 
  i do n't give a shit about this joke and i think brazilians get more offended that you do n't call it portuguese . 
  seriously , we colloquially call portuguese brazillian just brazillian here , and they get offended by that : /, 
  much of it was raised , yes , but this is n't civ , it was rebuilt ... 
  refusing colombus was actually a great move by the portuguese king at the time - this prevented spain from even trying to get to india and gave us full access to its riches . 
  it 's even debatable that we already knew about the unexplored continent on the other side of the world but did not have the manpower to fully explore and colonise it . 
  there is no concrete evidence of this because secret documents burnt down in a fire ( during the earthquake i think ) , but there must be a reason for the king to be adamant about moving the tordesillas line west , thus getting a piece of brazil . 
  you could have had 24 beers instead of the mojitos .

  this is true , air masses come from the atlantic or europe and they 're cold to warm . 
  air masses come from the sahara and they 're hot as fuck . 
  from the king actually . 
  and the king refused not only because he already had the plans in motion to reach india anyway , but because columbus plan was bad , because we already knew how far away india was and it was not what he said . 
  he really just got lucky there was something there . 
  also , fun theory : the portuguese king actually told columbus to sell his idea to spain so they would waste their resources on what would have been a futile effort , rather than competing against the portuguese . 
  true , his name is cristov\u00e3o colombo .

i thought you were just happy to see me . 
  portugal checking in , about 4 $ in my favorite place . 
  for those that are curious , we say eh-uu-roz . 
  i 'm high enough that this makes sense . 
  w factor . 
  this is actually pretty accurate . 
  neither can theirs . 
  this is a very interesting concept !, 
  i mean , i was aware of the idea of reintegrationism , but only applied to portugal and galicia . 
  iberian federalism as a concept is not so bad , as long as we 're talking about a swiss style federation . 
  i would n't mind being a federation with you guys . 
  on the other hand , it would seem hypocritical for you to confederate with us and then not grant independence to those in your country who actively seek it . 
  surely it would be better to just grant them independence and then confederate them ? 
  on this point we agree . 
  i 'm sure that 'll happen , of course , especially from citizens that feel like the eu has n't benefited them . 
  other people might actually be happy to take a step towards a more centralized government . 
  depends on the person 's political inclinations and personal stance on government , i suppose . 
  i think that the american model works on some situations and does n't on others . 
  for instance , take the legalization of marijuana . 
  legal in a state , but the feds can still raid dispensaries , because the federal government deems it illegal . 
  it 's also a bit different because michigan ( despite the collapse of the auto industry ) is still an economically varied state , with industries in all 3 sectors , even if it does have a propensity towards the secondary and tertiary sector . 
  not all member-states of the eu are like that . 
  as an example , portugal joined in the late 80s and gave up a lot of its agricultural production . 
  why ? 
  because of quotas . 
  farmers threw away milk because they were paid to not produce it , because they were exceeding their quotas . 
  atm , we 're not a self sustaining economy , as much as it pains me to say it . 
  that was a poor choice of words on my behalf . 
  i mean inevitable , not imminent . 
  i do n't think we 're united at all . 
  i think that is the single biggest opposing factor against federalization . 
  most of the issues that you have presented are mainly reflections on that . 
  other nations in the continent do n't trust the european leadership , even if they like the concepts for which the eu stands . 
  most countries do not wish to give up their independence , neither in military or diplomatic terms . 
  i doubt that a dutchman would enjoy having a german representing him in the un or as president of the eu , at least initially . 
  and what about royalty ? 
  what happens to them ? 
  anybody claiming that the uk is the biggest reason that federalization is not going faster is deluding themselves . 
  we are not united as a people , mainly because there is no reason why we should be . 
  hell , we 're not even united inside our own nations , let alone with our neighbouring states . 
  i still think it 's inevitable though . 
  not yet my friend . 
  but i feel that federalization is imminent . 
  i 'm very curious how such an event will be dealt with , culturally speaking . 
  we 're all pretty defensive about our national traditions and mentalities , and a lot of people wo n't be happy about being under a ( perceived or real ) franco-german thumb in terms of legislation . 
  i 'm sure that when the time comes , there will be plenty of discussions and naysayers . 
  most portuguese , save the most staunch nationalist , will not give a single fuck . 
  we have so many more problems to solve . 
  so do the spanish . 
  last i checked , portugal has no interest in forming a federation with spain . 
  pepe does n't deserve to play after what he did in the germany match . 
  the guy took a dive and then pepe thought it would be a good idea to touch him while he was down . 
  pepe is a world class defender playing for one of the world 's best clubs and for a fifa top 10 ranked national team . 
  that sort of behaviour does n't fly and is completely disproportionate to what was going on . 
  and our defense was all over the place . 
  and now we have even more injured players !, 
  edit : grammar, 
  trolling implies some sort of finesse . 
  there is no finesse here , just some guys raising hell and poorly i might add . 
  and of course , somebody got offended . 
  we deserved a tie , and that 's what we got . 
  we 're not , but you know how it is about vocal minorities .

  are you in the algarve ? 
  have you toured the rest of the country ? 
  i think we just love bitching about stuff . 
  ^ plus ^ there 's ^ all ^ the ^ english ^ living ^ in ^ the ^ algarve, 
  most likely due to the amount of portuguese people living abroad in france . 
  insofar as i know , they did n't do anything . 
  we buy our national dish from them . 
  maybe we 're upset about high prices ? 
  np dude . 
  just as a warning though , i 'm working on the weekend , so the soonest i can ship it off to you will be monday morning . 
  i can send you a bottle of francesinha sauce . 
  it 's not quite the same as homemade , but it 's not bad for a first experience . 
  pm me an address . 
  i 'm often surprised that a lot of people that come to portugal think it 's odd that we eat octopus . 
  it 's especially bizarre since pretty much everybody loves fried calamari . 
  through intense r&d , we 've also managed to make [ arroz de polvo ] ( https://lh3.ggpht.com/_gl8yfak8a8y/s7edgeg9cki/aaaaaaaaaf4/l64c3eis2jy/s1600/p1080015.jpg ), 
  reporting in to remind you all about the amazing francesinha , one of portugal 's gastronomical contributions to world cuisine . 
  if you 've never had one , fly to porto , eat one and be amazed at just how tasty it is . 
  then go back to your country wondering how hard it would be to make one yourself at home . 
  but you 'll never be the same ... 
  or he 's being nice . 
  i thought they 'd have emissions problems as well , [ but it does n't seem like they do ] ( http://www.midwestenergynews.com/2013/10/17/is-burning-garbage-green-in-sweden-theres-little-debate/ ) . 
  very interesting, 
  if you `` closed the tap '' it would n't be people in portugal that would freeze to death . 
  it 'd be the other countries . 
  that is actually a great idea . 
  however , we 're kind of short on cash right now , what with all the cutbacks and troika stuff . 
  i really did n't see that . 
  thanks, 
  when people volunteer to freeze to death ? 
  i wonder where we get ours from ? 
  it 's ok brother . 
  we 'll take this one . 
  we demand booze in return , as per the standing arrangement . 
  i 've always thought it weird that there 's not a bigger mead tradition here .

  what should not happen is having a pork-free menu just because some muslims do not want to eat pork . 
  secularism must be respected . 
  where 's the cow-free option for hindus ? 
  do not want to eat pork , eat the vegetarian option instead . 
  or eat only rice with vegetables in pork day , if there 's no vegetarian option . 
  secularism is about not catering to any particular religion . 
  just because for some eating pork is forbidden does not mean that you have to stop serving pork at schools . 
  this is exactly what happen in portugal where we have our wages frozen for about 15 years now and price have dropped in half . 
  life is great ... oh wait , i 'm mistaken drop with raise . 
  liberalism sure is a great concept . 
  ww3 ... you are forgetting that germany has a weaker military and does not have nukes . 
  so ... war avoided . 
  theoretically yes . 
  but in reality is up to france , germany and the uk . 
  schengen is no inside borders . 
  frontex is related to outside borders . 
  that was what i was referring to . 
  you maybe in frontex , but not schengen . 
  hey , you got a new million people in your workforce . 
  time to put it to work . 
  all i 'm hearing is : fence every inch of the border !!!, 
  fuck turkey . 
  [ ( the person ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkey_tolson_tjupurrula ), 
  we all know that sooner or later we all have to pay their debts . 
  the plan is completely infeasible . 
  but let 's wait a few more months/years until the 4th bailout is needed and destroy their economy in the process . 
  that sure is the way to do it . 
  it will cost way way more . 
   europe has a chance to show solidarity with their neighbors that went of the window with the way the greek crisis was handled . 
  it was very clear that every one should solve their own problems . 
  now germany ask for solidarity ? 
  that 's the problem when you follow your own interests when its convenient for you . 
  germany/france were the ones that trail the path of disunity we are seeing now and unless they show otherwise you will continue to see what you are seeing now . 
  the good ol' croatia-serbia-romania-ukraine-poland-germany route . 
  tell him to go around the shady neighbourhoods in the uk and say this : `` do you speak german ? '', 
  when they say no . 
  have him reply : `` you are welcomed '' . 
  he will have a great time this way . 
  i take it back then . 
  thought they did n't . 
  is in applicable to all of the eu ? 
  are n't romania , for example , one of the main fields where frontex is in force ? 
  but they do n't foot the bill for frontex . 
  schengen has no outer border patrol . 
  so norway has no power or responsibility when it comes to this . 
  all i was point out . 
  do n't know why you are surprised about portugal . 
  we are one of the leading countries in renewable energy . 
  something like 60 % to 70 % of our electric grid comes from renewable energies , and wind power is number two after hydraulic . 
  a few years ago it was around 27 % . 
  once we start using more solar and waves energy we maybe be completely fossil free . 
  we have all the potential for it . 
  just a matter of investment , which nowadays is a bit difficult . 
  frontex is unrelated to schengen . 
  it depends if your banks do n't collapse . 
  we should n't have a bailout too , but all of the sudden the taxpayer needed to foot the bill of banks and shit hit the fan . 
  i 'm not an expert on finland , but many reports are saying that finland is at risk . 
  i 'm not saying that if you do n't fix things you will need a bailout , but maybe you will get close to it . 
  norway has joined the eu ? 
  we have structural problems , right . 
  but some can not be addressed because of ez . 
  a lot of countries , with different economies , with problems arising from the same source . 
  and that 's a undeniable fact . 
  status quo can not be maintain . 
  euro must be reformed , either one way or the other . 
  but unfortunately a particularly country is profiting of the status quo and shit wo n't change until it gets affected . 
  funny enough the migrant policy is being discussed only because that particularly country is only now being affected . 
  i read the quote pretty well . 
  merkel started some peace talks that achieve nothing and were never going to achieve nothing . 
  it went like this : merkel : `` mr. assad , please step away '' . 
  assad : `` how about no ? '', 
  merkel : `` hum ... hum ... '' then she said that germany would accept every syrian refugee that comes to germany and the media started to talk about a nobel peace prize . 
  solely on some words . 
  not a single concrete action to solve either the syrian civil war or to take struggling refugees from turkey or lebanon . 
  give her a nobel !, 
  in portugal we have from nacional buses ( from lisbon to coimbra or porto , for example ) , not regional ones . 
  shitty wi-fi , but wi-fi still . 
  i 'm not saying currency solves everything . 
  and sweden had more economic power than finland . 
  but finland , contrary to portugal , spain and greece was a more established economy on the 90 's / 00 's , did not have half a century of dictatorship that had to recover from and did not had a big tourism sector and neither had a huge real estate boom . 
  but now they are struggling like hell , on the brink of maybing needing a bailout and their economy as nothing like ours . 
  the only thing that connect both is the currency . 
  a way overvalued currency for their type of economy , despite finland producing a lot of things and having a lot of research ( not on sweden levels ) economy . 
  honest question : is finland doing bad compared to sweden because of the euro ? 
  we southerns have our major economic difficulties coming because of the way the euro is set up . 
  if we had our independent currency we would n't be in recession . 
  it 's almost a decade since the crash and ez is still struggling . 
  sweden is doing ok , but finland is on the fence . 
  is this euro related ? 
  when you buy cow or pork meat you should expect to be buying cow or pork meat . 
  if you want horse you have horse meat available . 
  horse meat , i ate twice , is not very good , for my taste at least , and this is from horses good enough to be eaten , not some horses with shit tone of meds for racing , dying horses , etc. 
  public health and consumer rights are being put in danger . 
  is that so hard to see . 
  holidays ... dover ... no , thanks . 
   some would say she deserves a nobel peace prize for that for what ? 
  what merkel did to be awarded a nobel ? 
  did germany send planes for the refugees to come from turkey , lebanon to germany ? 
  no , they did not . 
  they are doing the same as every other european country , not deporting the refugees that enter the country even if they came from a safe country .

   mostly i believe all this talk about the problems of each specific country ( corruption in greece etc ) is just populism as a way to take attention away from where the problem really lies ( the eurozone construction fauls and the global financial system ) . 
  why is the euro a failure ? 
  because the currency is n't depreciating to pay for the debts ? 
  and what about the financial system ? 
  is it also germany 's fault and greece is just a victim of it ? 
   my position is that the problems all stem from the same source and that explains why they are so similar in their timing and manifestation . 
  and what source is that ? 
  the greek state 's mismanagement of its resources and consequent debt ? 
   also , how the hell is it possible for corruption in greece to bring it to its feet economically when at the same time a lot of countries that equally or more corrupt are doing perfectly fine ? 
  because those other corrupt countries did n't run the kind of massive deficits greece did . 
   of all the beautiful places we have , you chose that . 
   i think that many of the euro fanatics will blame the failure of the tax on the fact that not every single country in the eu implemented it and if all the euro countries implemented it , the blame would be shifted on the rest of the world which did n't implement such a short-sighted measure . 
  and we 'd go back to chasing ghosts and saying we must deal with all tax havens in the world . 
   someone must have hacked the flairs . 
  lol nope , i choose that flair xd,

   edit : relevant video eish que estrondeira \u00f3 belhote !, 
  i just puked a little in my mouth . 
   i 'm already a master student in a social science field , did n't take high-school math you 're doing it wrong . 
   slavery is bad , for example , which is what many job offers in our country are starting to be ( without the physical punishment associated with slavery , though ) . 
  it 's not slavery if you can refuse it . 
   still , for that to happen , everyone would have to take up shitty , quasi-slavery jobs . 
  or not , as those jobs would be pushed away as more and more people became employed and improved their living standards . 
  our labour laws are far more restrictive than those in the uk or the usa and yet we are the ones with the lowest paying jobs . 
   do n't really feel like paying for the mistakes of previous generations . 
  me neither , that 's why i 'm seriously considering migrating . 
  still , those who remain here and continue to go down this path of restricting the labour market , it will be no surprise that unemployment will continue to rise . . sure , there are plenty other factors that come into the picture , but this one is a very serious one . 
   i would wager that most the population do n't want to be abused  i also wager that , but between letting people choose for themselves what they want or the government saying `` no , you ca n't accept that '' , i 'd rather be free to choose and take responsibility for my actions . 
   if you open exceptions that will create ( more ) loop-holes in the legislation which in turn will allow more abuse by the employers . 
  i 'd slash labour legislation and not only . 
  one should be free to work for whomever he wants however he wants and also should be free to start his own business whatever it might be . 
  and this right now is really difficult because of all the bureaucracy and regulation and permits one must acquire to actually run a business . 
   now , our country does have rather restrictive law regarding labour . 
  this is both good and bad . 
  obviously it 's good for the employee and bad for the employer . 
  nonsense , above everything , it 's bad for the employee and ( even worse ) for the unemployed . 
  it 's indifferent for an employers to pay higher than the minimum wage for a skilled worker , the one who 's worse off is the unskilled one that 's out of a job . 
  it 's indifferent for an employer to pay for the worker 's vacations out of the worker 's wage , the worker is the one that 's paying for it even if he does n't want the vacation time . 
  it 's indifferent for an employer to pay for the sickness leave of its workers , they are the ones who are paying for it with their own wages and also the unemployed which could be employed but are n't because the employer is using that money to pay for special benefits when he could be hiring more people . 
   as with everything in life , a balance must always be achieved . 
  what must be achieved is not restricting people 's freedoms , if they want to do whatever they want , let them , they 're not stupid and they do n't need to be taken care off . 
  the balance that must be achieved is the best life quality possible and that 's achieved with the highest wages and the lowest unemployment , and for that , restricting the labour market is acting against your own interests . 
   but even if the scales are not balanced , the labour laws are n't the biggest impediment to job creation in portugal - all the extra taxes and bureaucracy are ( well , that and lack of funding and innovative ideas ) . 
  yup , that 's why you need to tackle all the issues and not only this one . 
   no , i do n't believe being ( more ) raped in the ass will solve our crisis or help unemployment or help anyone but greedy bosses ( and you know very well that portugal is full of wise-guys that try to take advantage of the system as best as they can ) . 
  knock it off with the word greedy , everybody 's greedy , nobody 's selfless like that . 
  anyway , if you want employers to treat their employees fine , you must make them compete against one another , and that 's just not going to happen with such a large pool of unemployed people . 
  remove restrictions in both labour laws and in creating a business and let everyone freely work for whomever he wants or let them be the ones starting their own job - that 's the one way you 'll fix our labour market , reduce unemployment and improve both the wages of the workers and the productivity of the companies - it certainly wo n't happen with all these laws and regulations that are pulling us down . 
   regulation is necessary in employment or the employers would take total advantage of you . 
  no , it 's not . 
  regulation is trading away `` bad '' jobs for unemployment . 
  and the best tool for good wages and good labour standards is low unemployment so that it 's harder for employers to find good workers at a low wage and so that it 's easier for employees to find good work at a high wage . 
   what would it matter if you had a job but you were only paid enough to survive ? 
  that would be degrading and would n't boost the economy at all . 
  what would it matter if the government restricted your choice and chose for you that that job was n't sufficient and you could n't accept it regardless of your own opinion ? 
  your unemployment would be even more degrading and would pull the economy down . 
   so , by rising the retirement age and taking the possibility of employing younger people we 're not harming youth employment ? 
  that 's an austerity measure . 
  no , they 're not austerity measures , austerity means cutting public spending . 
  those are structural reforms and i do n't know about those . 
   wan na know more austerity measures ? 
  what of rising tuition costs ? 
  lower pay rates . 
  mass layoffs ( which affect the youngest state employees who stand to receive a smaller severance pay ) . 
  what of lower or no social benefits ? 
  ( ... ) cuts in state child support or any kind of aid to struggling young families ? 
  yep , all of those are consequences of austerity . 
  a direct consequence of s\u00f3crates ' expansionary fiscal policies and public works . 
   what of higher irs taxes ( ... ) what of rising social security contributions ? 
  not austerity . 
   did you know that if you get paid 240 euros a month ( precarious `` green '' slips ) you have to pay 124,90 euros compulsively to social security ? 
  that leaves a young adult with 120 euros to live with . 
  i did n't know about that though , if you care about what i think , i 'll let you know that i 'm opposed to compulsory social security . 
   this austerity is being pushed onto the younger generations and the middle class unfortunately , that 's obvious ? 
  whom else was going to pay for it ? 
  the wealthy which have already left the country those that never even deposited their money here ? 
   instead of those considerably wealthier and more responsible in the current economic woes ... 
  the responsible are n't the rich , the responsible are the awful policies which we pursued , the constant attempts at restricting the free market and instead trying to run a mixed economy with prevalent government interventionism . 
  therefore , all of us are responsible , we were the ones who voted and keep on voting for out mps . 
   you do n't see that . 
  maybe because you see yourself as a temporarily embarrassed millionaire . 
  no , i do n't . 
  i see myself as someone without a future here once i finish university , i see myself as someone being forced away because there are no opportunities for me in portugal , i see myself kicked out of home because my parents ' and grandparents ' generations failed to manage this country properly . 
  i see yet another failure of socialism and i see people still not giving up on this retarded religion despite its constant failures and i see people still not bothering to learn how a free market actually works even with plenty of real life examples of how it succeeded . 
  to keep it simple , i see my country in the shit and it 's sad because i actually love it here . 
  and please do n't say that `` temporarily embarrassed millionaire '' as if you were trying to explain why socialism never became popular in the usa . 
   yes , but surely having that many young people on welfare instead of paying tax is counter productive ? 
  what 's counter productive is restricting employment with needless bureaucracy , regulations , licences , permits and taxes .

  do n't create a situation in which such things are likely to take place again , why borrow trouble you do n't need or want ? 
  the reason such slogans are effective is because many people have such sentiments , by shaming people with such feelings just end up driving them towards the people who promise to take care of it . 
  in my opinion it is the job of mainstream politics to ensure that such things are not necessary , forcing mass immigration is not a way you will prevent such behaviour from repeating .

  i just watched a new program with a bunch of germans clapping the refugees arriving in frankfurt , it was quite surreal behaviour to me . 
  there are push factors like wars and then there are pull factors like welfare and politicians who say all syrians are willkommen . 
   he may be a clueless idiot but at least he 's not crazy suicidal traitor destroying and singing off their country . 
  is n't his government proposing to topple assad ? 
  i do n't know about you but in my opinion that will just mean more refugee 's, 
  i should probably read the article then . 
   i seriously do n't get it these are the same people who would probably fight for the right to make insulting images of a muslim prophet they will attack you for this as well , criticism of non white people is racism in their eyes . 
  * grabs fistful of chest hair * . 
  and how will you keep these 5000 people in hungary when they want to go to the money states ? 
  better prepare for more articles about how hungary are brutal racists doing nazi like things to the poor poor refugees . 
  are they not rebelling against hungarian order and committing a crime by violating hungary 's territorial space ? 
  it is all about virtue signalling , they are in a competition to show how compassionate , tolerant and not racist they are . 
  if you pay attention you will see some of them on this sub , usually they will say stuff like `` i am ashamed of my country '' , but they never will provide a reasonable alternative to what they object to . 
  the whole frenzy over that drowned syrian kid is an example of mass virtue signalling , during the hostage thing in sydney australia people could n't wait for the crisis to be over before going on twitter #illridewithyou to show solidarity with muslims who might be harassed over the incident . 
  i did n't say anything about the syrian refugee 's , my only gripe with them is the fact that they can easily apply for asylum whilst in the camp 's in turkey and they are very likely to be accepted . 
  but europe gets migrants from many other places to , such as nigeria , pakistan and albania to name a few , and as for your better economies , france and the united kingdom have about equal economies and yet there are people in france trying to get to the uk . 
  the only reason i can think of for that is the welfare is more generous in the uk, 
  some do yes , are you trying to claim that there are no safe country 's enroute to europe ? 
  if safety is your priority then why risk a dangerous journey to another continent ?

  in america there is a small christian sect called the quiver fulls and one of their tenets is to have lots of kids for armageddon or something , there are muslims who also believe that islam is destined to be the world religion , and one of the way 's they see this happening is a high birthrate , erdoghan and gaddafi said something along these lines i believe . 
  remember demographics is destiny and in some places in europe 70 % of kids in school are non european .

   `` it 's our moral and legal duty to take those people to safety , which means north , not south , '' added the diplomat , who spoke on the condition of anonymity looks like it is the opposite , they seem to be proposing to ferry people across the mediterranean , obviously it 's not as the greek side so they are trying to remedy that . 
   enough to complain and obliviously blame merkel , apparently . 
  and once again we seem to be arguing different points , my contention is that yes what she said was taken out of context , but she should have known this and maybe tempered her words . 
  you on the other hand seem to be arguing that i am the one misinterpreting what she said . 
   if people would read more than just a headline , there could be a healthy discussion , but with the blissful ignorance people continue to demonstrate on here , no chance . 
  and you keep arguing this , nobody is saying that merkel said exactly this , just that it has given the migrants this impression , and that at the end of the day is all that matters in the current situation . 
  and to strengthen this impression you have football teams and various other groups engaged in there own little feel good stunts . 
   better still , by considering the entire policy of the german government . 
  how much does someone not interested in the goings on in germany really know ? 
   i think an old wooden sign with a skull and bone is a universal sign of danger . 
  different culture , might have no meaning to them or they misinterpret it as keep out . 
  damn that 's some epic spin going on there . 
   there is an existing databank where law enforcement can look up every single application for asylum . 
  maybe portuguese police needs it lessons ? 
   lack of solidarity is funny , when your own country would be in a really bad spot without the solidarity of the other eu countries . 
  now you are just being a bit of a bigot , i could put forth an argument but since you have devolved to this level of conversational tactics i feel that there is no point . 
   areas suspected to contain land mines are marked with more than 12,000 warning signs . 
  in arabic ? 
   i get your joke , but dclauzel is not actually that bad . 
  he 's the most active mod and trust me , there is a lot of shit posted here daily ; i 've spent some time in europe/new and i 've seen it myself . 
   it 's true he might be overzealous but i 'm giving him a break for now . 
   well stop worrying , because germany does n't `` worry '' about it . 
  if it 's not a problem then why this big push to share the love with the rest of europe ? 
  germany is a free country able to decide for itself , it should let other countries decide for themselves as well . 
  have you given a thought as to how these people are to be coerced into staying in the country assigned to them in the quota system , or will we be subjected to countless headlines about how these people `` without values '' are treating the poor refugees ? 
   they still will have to go through all the paperwork to prove their status and that their lives are in danger back in their home country . 
  and that costs money to do , and they are not going to live in the bushes whilst all this goes on right ? 
   not without international involvement , no . 
  if assad was killed today you still wo n't be able to put humpty dumpty back together again . 
   i also doubt the trafickers have the capabilities to get them to europe . 
  there have been calls to send ships to pick them up . 
   like i said in my op , i do n't want emotions either for or against . 
  i want numbers , solutions , long-term plans and foreign policy . 
  except this entire story is about getting your emotions up . 
  damned if you do damned if you do n't , just open the gates hungary , i give you permission . 
  what do the proposers of this migrant quota system expect is going to happen when you try to keep people who want to move out of your country and show no respect for the rule of law ? 
   germany is taking several 100000 refugees in while portugal took in 500 .

  i would feel sorry for those people throwing stuff to a church ... maybe they have mental issues or something, 
   nobel laureate stiglitz sees ... 
  stopped there . 
  let \u00b4 s face it , is going to happen . 
  ww3 is just right in the corner . 
  why would someone by jailed for throwing bacon ? 
  dog \u00b4 s owners didnd \u00b4 t pissed in the bikes themselves ... that \u00b4 s positive i guess !, 
  my comment was disrespectful to the uk as an all ; ukip members don \u00b4 t represent the all country , but the all country as to answer on the kind of people they bring to international organizations, 
  uk pushing eu to new levels ... again . 
  it \u00b4 s starting to happen already ... looks like a prophecy to me . 
  the us continuous imperial expansion is going to send us all down the drain ... 
  it \u00b4 s part of the economic war ... 
  since i lose money because of your lies ? 
  setting the house on fire ; they deserve it, 
  awkward moment of the day ... 
  people can go for a bank run whenever and in quantity they want ... the bank will only deliver the money they want . 
  is as if greeks are greeks worst enemies !, 
  ... now try to explain that to a greek here ... lost cause . 
  is as if being a decent law abiding person in greece was some kind of congenital malformation in the recto . 
  are you guys sure you don \u00b4 t rule the world ? 
  congratulations mexico ... must be something weather related to be this good . 
  turkey should get new advisers ... this ones only advise bad deals . 
  looks good , bet it tastes even better ... 
  i like what you did there ... nice, 
   i found out the other day that my wife 's uncle voted for brexit because his son is training to be a doctor , and does n't like jeremy hunt , who campaigned for remain . 
  hummm ... ok ...  `` here i am , ishmael , '' he told me recently , in his office at the european parliament in strasbourg , invoking the old testament as he gestured around him . 
  `` every man 's hand is against me . '' ... looks mental disturbing ... 
  so leave ... 
  farage could be the dictator ... there \u00b4 s potential in there !, 
   the first thing the italian dude did , when he got money was to buy a horse as a gift , like he won the lottery . 
  this mentality is not very encouraging . 
  i don \u00b4 t necessarily agree with you , because i don \u00b4 t know the all story here , but in the story i \u00b4 ve eared in the video , the guy uses the pony in festivities to take a ride with the little kids ; well , maybe he gets payed for this service , so is putting the investment to rent, 
  ok , but this is a start ... the principles are there ... and to start a fire , you only need a spark in the right spot . 
  this is bad news for the incompetent populist ... 
  i get this i get this ... `` asian skeleton found in romanian place , on a polish neighbourhood , in britain '', 
  looks like a 4 year old letter, 
  `` failed to declare '' ... because we all know how this things work . 
  looks like he is the populist of the place, 
  rich cultures ... people had time to spend on those things ; dresses , cuisine , traditions ... 
  the fence is to keep people out or to keep people in ? 
  is not about getting there , is how you get there . 
  they tell here in europe that gypsies eat children at breakfast ... and migrants have diseases and are cannibals ; europe is getting very nasty with all this bad people . 
  this only happens in third world countries . 
  first world countries are so developed that people think they vote in consciousness ... 
   soviet union superheroes, 
  what brexit ? 
  i think they reduced personal in the trolls factory , crisis probably ... ** edit ** : western propaganda machine still strong though, 
  there \u00b4 s hope for mankind after all, 
  killing your adversaries is stood up for yourself and not giving a shit about your country, 
   are you a field worker ? 
  didn \u00b4 t get that reference or what do you mean . 
   i simply defended hungary 's right and obligation as a country to defend it 's borders and it 's interests as it perceives them it \u00b4 s women , children , old people and some younger ones , but unarmed ... it \u00b4 s not a fucking army , this people want shelter and some food to keep going their journey . 
   i as a citizen of serbia , a european fucking country ( i checked it on a map ) , had to pay 100 euros and wait in lines bad things happened in your country not so long ago ; really bad stuff . 
  probably precautions measures . 
   who is selling the weapons to terrorists ? 
  well let me elucidate you on this one [ 27-7-2016 ] ( https://www.google.pt/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahukewi0xpyrlozpahxfvrokhd6ca-iqfggemaa&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.theguardian.com%2fworld%2f2016%2fjul%2f27%2fweapons-flowing-eastern-europe-middle-east-revealed-arms-trade-syria&amp;usg=afqjcnglkz3sajtbpyqpcjuyq03ahnq42a&amp;sig2=qclooet1p6p23lk8yy-plq&amp;bvm=bv.132479545,d.d2s&amp;cad=rja )  but lets talk about consequences and shame countries that defend their borders and interests dictated by the constitutions of said countries . 
  all what was asked from a decent country was to receive , register and process those refugees in a human way , for good sake . 
  is that so difficult to accomplish that you need to stop those people at a barrel of a gun ? 
  we can be poor , no one wants to came here because no money and no jobs , but we still have mothers to teach us something . 
  thanks . 
  i try hard to be called douchebag by someone who defends treating people like shit , just because they are refugees or whatever ... 
  so hungary is run by scumbag people , that threat other people like shit , razing barber wire fences to stop people getting in their shitty countries . 
  this refugees don \u00b4 t want to stay in shitty hungary , because who on his right mind want to stay there . 
  at the same time hungary and other eastern countries sell weapons to isis that help foment the wars that bring refugees to hungary doorstep . 
  luxembourg on the other hand is a rich country , with high standard of living . 
  this tiny country gets his money to feed his people from money laundry and tax evasion from around the world . 
  i \u00b4 m confused ... which is lower by the scumbags standards ? 
  judging by your comment you don \u00b4 t even know what values are , how can you talk about them ? 
  i agree with the idea that hungary has a shameful behaviour towards refugees , press independence ... apparently they are now selling weapons to isis and building fences to stop refugees that ran from wars created by isis , but let \u00b4 s check luxembourg toward tax evasion !, 
  where does luxembourg gets it \u00b4 s money to keep his standard of living ? 
  it \u00b4 s all the same shit with different names . 
  could not agree with you more . 
  i just hope you where \u00b4 t referring to me as the guy who owns the idea and not the reasoning that lead to that idea . 
  there are ways to mitigate the pain ; in the limit you can always choose to shut down the machines . 
  that idea to die or live in constant pain i believe is not a correct one . 
  there \u00b4 s a big difference between shutting down a machine that keeps someone alive , and to use euthanasia in a decision made by someone consciousness before the big troubles caused by a disease . 
  i don \u00b4 t agree with you . 
  i \u00b4 m not judging , i \u00b4 m question their options ; i \u00b4 m entitled to one opinion and i \u00b4 m free to communicate that opinion to the world . 
   you can not deny another person the choice because you can not fathom her reasons . 
  by this level of thinking , anything is possible ; i have an hot discussion with someone and by accident or not i kill the other person ... was self defense , who are you to judge me ? 
  if she wants to die , let her die ; in some parts of the world they still use a bullet in the head ; like i said , it \u00b4 s all fucked up ; people are capable of the best and of the worst ... this is not the best of mankind face , that \u00b4 s for sure . 
  why suffer ? 
  ... like suffering wasn \u00b4 t part of life ; let \u00b4 s erase the bad memories from our minds and only keep the good ones . 
  like in between the euthanasia and natural dead she couldn \u00b4 t have good moments !, 
  ... what a disgrace of society ... 
  how to put this into perspective , without insulting anyone ? 
  wtf, 
  let \u00b4 s face it . 
  the system is broken ; the only way out of this is fragmentation , with small regions or communities gaining more independence . 
  states are broken . 
  yes u can, 
  glad to hear that ... thanks, 
  looks like a nice step towards integration ... separate to segregate . 
  what can go wrong ? 
  [ first imgaes ] ( https://youtu.be/qiqm86ee5q8 ), 
  i \u00b4 ve mixed feelings ... part of me wants to cry and the other part wants to laugh ... but i guess i \u00b4 m not the only joke , that makes my misfortune more bearable, 
  3.8 in greece seems very low ; also 8,2 in portugal seems absurd high ; looks crappy stats to me, 
  how do you suicide .2 ? 
  ... shoot both legs ? 
  the lack of respect for their fellow man , in a time of need , in a position of despair ... more of a psychopath,

  it really is . 
  you just better earn your money before coming here . 
  in short , a great place to retire . 
  maybe we can be europe 's florida or something . 
  there was a reasonable reduction in consumption last year due to the depression ( something like 2-3 % ) , but yeah , mostly what vayl said . 
  shitty weather this year . 
  true . 
  this is basically people being afraid for their future so they are saving . 
  portuguese are very pessimistic right now . 
  with good reason i might add . 
  you may be reading too much tone in my text . 
  it was a heated argument but it was n't meant to be rude . 
   according to which analysis ? 
  well the greeks already lost more than 25 % gdp , ours keeps falling every year . 
  so i would say , according to previous experiences with the troika genious plans . 
  that 's a bunch of bullcrap . 
  poor people do n't live from their savings - they have no savings . 
  they live paycheck to paycheck . 
  what increases inequality is the fact that they have no jobs . 
  the problem is not an overvalued real estate market , the problem is that we are literally experiencing deflation and that we are indebted . 
   when all issues are put into account a fall up to -15 % as the worst case scenario would be possible i do n't think this is a bad outcome at all . 
  troika policies will have a much worse result . 
  the second analysis does not even consider the possibility of an euro exit . 
  the first one does , but it mainly says that it is unknown what would happen and that the effects can not be underestimated . 
  i would n't say either of them completely disagree with an euro exit , they just dismissed taking the possibility seriously . 
  probably because they still want to pay their debts . 
  obviously an euro exit would have a default going along with it . 
  this is really just the beginning . 
  after your economy completely crashes these measures obviously wo n't be enough . 
  for instance , 18 % vat is clearly way too low , and it will be the first thing to be risen after they fail to get enough money from the other measures as vat is one of the easiest ways to get money quickly . 
  there 's really only one way to go now and it 's ^ vv down ^ vv . 
  get used to it or be smart and get out of this union sooner rather than later . 
  it will be horrible either way . 
  outside the euro , at least , you will have some chance of recovering . 
  oh well , they will probably be stealing our deposits next . 
  what should really be feared is huge levels of unemployment which constitute a huge waste of resources . 
  more than ever , inflation is very necessary . 
  if you do n't have real growth you need nominal growth . 
  otherwise everything goes bankrupt . 
  even in abstract terms i support a little bit of inflation . 
  people should not be lazy with their money , money should be used and invested . 
  it 's easy to protect yourself from it by doing so . 
  why not ? 
  i thought it was ok to steal from `` oligarchs '' . 
  ok then stop pretending they are trying to `` help us '' , among other things , solving our competitiveness problem as this would be the fastest way . 
  it would also be good for regular germans as it would mean higher wages relative to other europeans . 
  anyway , if they do n't want to do anything not in their immediate self interest just leave the union already . 
  problem solved . 
  it 's also fair since we had no problem with the ecb lowering interest rates during the dotcom bust to give breathing room to the `` core '' countries . 
  frankly that we have to convince the german populace and are waiting on their elections just shows how dysfunctional this union is . 
   `` if you go back 70 years to solve a problem today , you ca n't do that . 
  so for me and for my family , it 's just stupid . 
  i look at the pictures and i just have to laugh . 
  they are so dumb . 
  really , really dumb and stupid . '', 
  i totally agree with this random german dude . 
  maybe germans could also stop going back 80 years into the past and stop fearing inflation so much . 
  i hate this day so much . 
  it 's not funny ... 
  krugman is absolutely right . 
  it does n't matter , soon this thread will be fillled with - inflation is the devil , krugman is an idiot - arguments . 
  europeans are complete morons who think they know more about economics than krugman because they successfully manage their household 's grocery shopping . 
  pretty disgusting to take photos of someone in their private life . 
  fuck the photographers who do this and the newspapers that publish it . 
  yeah i 'm so shallow . 
  glad you all get to rightly feel as superior hipsters who do n't care . 
  ahahah , well , normal people should feel conflicted sometimes . 
  it 's not a simple world . 
  although , i 'm not exactly defending a male uniform , just a modicum of good taste and not letting your sponsors dress you anyway they like . 
  lol wtf . 
  i seriously did not know this existed in europe . 
  no you do n't understand how europe works . 
  this is great news . 
  you are becoming more competitive . 
  til that , in finland , female repellent clothes are considered gorgeous . 
  are you seriously trying to defend this attire ? 
   well , they composed a budget for 2012 which would make the deficit below 3 % . 
  there 've been numerous cuts throughout public spending , and the deficit is still 4.1 % . 
  looks like someone miscalculated their multipliers for you too or , more likely , like all european governments . 
  your budget was based on way too optimistic predictions . 
  because , you know , we would be getting out of the crisis in 2013 right . 
  we 're in the middle of a great depression it 's normal to have some deficit . 
  if europe stopped having an idiotic monetary policy already we could actually be fine with it . 
  anyway even without that your government is still perfectly fine . 
  i 'm not sure what do people want with this latest string of news on france , belgium and the netherlands . 
  maybe sch\u00e4uble wants to restructure you guys too . 
  this was n't exactly cheating . 
  the accounting methodology changed . 
  there have been a lot of changes to it since this crisis started . 
  lots of things that were n't counted are now counted . 
  it 's one of the only good things that have come out of this crisis to be honest . 
  i do n't get it . 
  i thought northerners did n't even bath . 
  how is that water getting dirty !, 
  are you counting debt forgiveness ? 
  it would also reduce their competitiveness because their energy would be more expensive . 
  their problems would be bigger . 
  have you looked at the patterns in their tea leaves ? 
  i was hoping you had a recipe to make chicken soup without adding water . 
  1 million euros .

  we have reliable relations with iran . 
  france , germany , sweden , etc. 
  why should we become hostile to iran again ? 
  because trump said so ? 
  i never said the eu should cut its regulations with the us because of the egotistical maniac . 
  he will probably only last 4 years anyway . 
  but just as it should keep a relationship with the us it should have one with iran ? 
  you do n't handle well with different opinions do you ? 
  i 'm well attached to reality , i just have a different opinion from you in this matter . 
  so cut the patronizing and disrespect . 
  par for the course in the middle east . 
  saudi arabia and every other sunni country does the same . 
  so by your reasoning they should not be our allies . 
  also in the past decade , terrorism is funded by sunnis organizations , the sunnis are funding extremist mosques and ideologies in europe , and we have been suffering because of that . 
  so while iran is far from an ideal partner , imo they 're more reliable and trustworthy to be engaged diplomatically and economically than the sunni regimes . 
  so no , it 's not a `` go against the us no matter what the issue '' . 
  i lived in the us , i love the country , but europe must define its own foreign policy and it should not be dependent on the whims of an administration ran by a egotistical maniac . 
  also , engaging economically and diplomatically is crucial to defuse tensions ( like obama previously did with iran ) . 
  so this should be done with iran , and russia when they also adopt a less confrontational posture . 
  i hope the eu stands its ground versus the us and keeps its relations with iran . 
  no , i did n't made it up on my own . 
  democracy is not literally only about majority rule and you are ignorant if you claim otherwise . 
  having support does not mean he is not a dictator . 
  to be a democrat one has to respect minorities , freedom of the press and independence of the judicial system . 
  erdogan does neither of these . 
  and i fail to understand what being liberal or conservative had anything to do with respecting these basic tenets of democracy . 
  plenty of european conservative parties respect them and are democratic . 
  les republicains in france , the conservative party in the uk , etc , etc. 
  there 's a person in poland who does not occupy a position in the polish government or presidency , who effectively has a project to control poland . 
  be very careful about what may happen in the future , because autocrats do things sneakily untill they have enough control to fully reveal themselves . 
  look how long it took for erdogan to become the dictator he is today . 
  but a lot of people read them , unfortunately . 
  you know , you know ? 
  probably because the economy in italy has been in bad shape for so long your compatriots are disillusioned about the eu . 
  i cracked up because portugal looks ** exactly ** the same . 
  because these are private companies and the french state is inserting itself in this . 
  considering that most radicalized people in france are french , then they 're already home . 
  as it rightly should . 
  while i really wanted macron to win , this type of move threatens to alienate italy from the eu . 
  it 's well known that italy has not benefited from the euro at all , and this type of moves only strengthens the euroskeptics of italy with good reason . 
  if macron truly sees himself as an europeist , then he should not be protectionist against companies from other european countries acquiring controlling shares in french companies . 
  otherwise , it just reeks of the european union being a system of economic dominance by france and germany over the rest of the continent . 
  is that the impression they want to pass ? 
  diesel is greener for the environment but much worse for public health . 
  it 's separate issues . 
  do you know how much vat , vehicle taxes or other obscure taxes there are in southern countries ? 
  it already is an economic superpower . 
  if you mean a military superpower like what the soviet union was , and the us still is , that will take a couple more decades but they 're getting there . 
  but even so they already have plenty of nuclear subs which are advanced enough to be competitive vs western nuclear submarines , they already retrofitted their first aircraft carrier and are building a bunh of others after learning the engineering lessons from that first soviet carrier . 
  they are well on their way to become a superpower . 
  why do you think china will break into smaller entities ? 
  because 90 % of china 's population are from the same ethnicity and they do n't want to break into smaller entities . 
  i could see hong kong and taiwan trying to declare independence eventually , but that 's pretty much it . 
  good one . 
  well , too bad for them then . 
  they do n't vote to elect the ecb . 
  europe is more than germany and northern countries . 
  those lazy southerners , taking vacations . 
  or how about waiting for the inflation rate to actually pick up , and allow southern economies to actually grow ? 
  because italy is still not growing `` nicely '' as you put it . 
  the good thing about you guys getting in the eu was that we stopped being in the top-2 of all the negative charts !, 
  if this passes i hope google blocks google news in every european country . 
  that should teach these freaking greedy lobbyists that they should evolve instead of living like parasites sucking on the teat of companies that actually do something . 
  when michelle obama went to saudi arabia , she did n't use the headscarf . 
  nothing bad came of that . 
  iran needs more the eu than the eu needs iran because having solid relationships with the eu diminishes the possiblity of a nato strike in iran . 
  therefore , the eu leaders should stop being pussies and not defend the european values when they go abroad . 
  not exactly green , but better than non-renewable atlernatives . 
  a lot of the energy in portugal is also from hydropower . 
  we actually have a very small solar component in our energy mix , opposed to italy so we have to increase that one . 
  one of my favorite moments when i was in amsterdam was chilling out outside the main touristy areas eating bitterballen and drinking beers in a bar only with dutch people . 
  some people have difficulty in interpreting nutritional labels and in knowing what is good or bad for them . 
  it 's easy to say what you say when you are young , educated internet user . 
  it 's not that easy if you 're older , with poorer education and ahrder access to education . 
  but yeah , keep telling yourself that . 
  not really . 
  it 's perfectly possible to have buildings that respect the traditional architecture of a city without increasing prices . 
  dear polish friends . 
  the situation in your country is getting really fucking scary and this guy is really becoming deranged . 
  be careful because if this keeps going like this you might end up looking like turkey or venezuela . 
  he wants to cripple your democracy . 
  why the aggressiveness dude ? 
  i can assure you most people do n't read the nutritional labels of every product they buy . 
  do you , when you go to the supermarket ???? 
  if people are buying yogurts , because it usually is a healthy product then it 's completely ridiculous that it 's completely saturated with fat and sugar . 
  so yeah , companies should be held accountable for that and not the old or uneducated people who have a hard time making informed decisions about their nutrition . 
  stop acting like a asshole . 
  exactly . 
  i really hate modern architecture trends . 
  i ca n't wait for us to go back to more elaborate buildings . 
  yeah , i hope that changes then !, 
  these companies need to understand that central europe and eastern europe countries in the eu should be treated the same as the others . 
  i was asking for clarification because it seemed to me like some countries throwing a tantrum and seeing differences in treatment between markets that could have other justifications for said treatment . 
  there 's plenty of cases where the composition of certain processed food are different as well in western countries , but other people already explained the context to me instead of getting all defensive like you . 
  i also thought the same . 
  sensationalist and in a way making it seem like economic growth is a competition . 
  the uk are still an european country , and a partner . 
  their economy may have hit a snag but i hope they overcome . 
  it 's unusual for a developed country to have continuous sustained growth . 
  eventually some times there are deccelarations .

smoke from the fires, 
  how cool !, 
  thank you for sharing that , its interesting to see little connections, 
  hum interesting , some old people here in portugal will also say `` oiros '' and oiros means golds it 's rather curious, 
  `` ficar na merda '' - `` be on the shit '' not the best translation of it but you get the grasp `` meter a pata na po\u00e7a '' - `` put your foot on the puddle '' `` saiu-te o tiro pela culatra '' - `` it backfired on you '' `` azar da cueca '' - `` bad luck of the panties '' ( open to interpretations and i do n't know if it is used by that many people ), 
  today a spaniard passed me in a roundabout driving like a maniac , so we are not the only maniacs although its not a lie we drive fast , but spaniards or people with a spanish license plate take the crown, 
  inglaterra in portuguese which is literally england, 
  some claim it was actually we the portuguese to set foot in oceania first but it was too far away for us to care ... 
  honestly i do n't know that much about it so take my word as you wish, 
  lol ... coitadinho do animal, 
  do you mind if i send you a private message ? 
  once again i thank you for your help your help actually made me decide to write a small chapter about the requirements that each member state demand of a credit establishment , i am currently doing it about france , but will add spain , italy , belgium and maybe germany i would like your input if you do n't mind, 
  thank you again you are being a great help it 's all clear now , i read the french code monetaire but it was hard to interpret and to know where to look for things thank you very much , merci beaucoup !, 
  ps : you need to worry about your english level , you speak very well !, 
  hi again !, 
  can you tell me one thing about the banking union ? 
  i was reading a paper and france is mentioned , the author says that in france a bank does n't need to do 3 things to be considered a credit establishment , is that true ? 
  has it changed ? 
  thank you very much i am going to read them and let you know how it went no need to worry about it being in french , its the help that counts and i can understand french once again , thank you !, 
  thank you very much what i really need to find and analyse is directives directly related to the community passport regarding banks in the union , have you heard of it ? 
  hi , thank you !, 
  its about the community passport regarding banks , have you heard about it ? 
  well so i could gather all the directives from 1973 until now where they speak about banking and harmonizing banking law for all the members of the eu etc , i know it 2012 we started building the banking union but i ca n't find any directive after 2006 that touches this topic by legal diplomas i mean directives , regulations , recommendations etc, 
  yes there 's one guy from my village that moved to eindhoven and he tried to explain what you just did but he is n't as articulated as you are , so thank you for explaining it in such a easy to understand yes , we have one face that we show the world , one that we show our friends and family and another that is our real face and that only we know ... something in the lines of this claro !, 
  yes , exactly !, 
  but when you start working for real , how will you deal with social security matters ? 
  once again you are right !, 
  that also reminds me of that japanese theory ( ? ), 
  that we have 3 faces , do you know it ? 
  hm , take advantage of the benefits do n't be dumb , if they exist its for people to use them , i do n't mean abuse them its all with `` conta e medida '' this got dark all of the sudden , lol muito bem !, 
  smart move on your part !, 
  shh no one needs to know that for real its always nice to have a good sense of humour and be playful that does n't mean you are childish or less mature \u00c9 poliglota do catano !, 
  quantas l\u00ednguas falas ? 
  uau !, 
  very focused and goal driven !, 
  if it was now would you still go through all the bureaucracy ? 
  or not really ? 
  for me you would only be french the moment you spoke portuguese with a fake french accent or if you came back and spoke in french to everyone and then turned around and spoke in pt , that actually happened !, 
  a man asked me for directions in french , i almost `` died '' trying to explain it to him and then he turns around and speaks portuguese to his wife hats off !, 
  after everything you wrote you must be like 20 and with tons of maturity to offer !, 
  ok , `` tudei waz a gude dei '' for you then !, 
  i 'm kidding , i assume you would vote for him , but i asked because i thought since you went to france at 14 that you had decided to get double nationality or something that 's right !, 
  you are very assertive and you clearly have strong opinions , its refreshing !, 
  i agree with you about the anonymity its fairly recent if we look at the grand scheme of the rest of europe , but it seems well established , so that makes it even mote impressive that you got in !, 
  how far are you in your degree ? 
  boa !, 
  this got me thinking , and this question can be stupid , so sorry in advance but could you vote in the french elections ? 
  yes but that works when you have a big class , not in secondary school or whatever where they know every student and grade according to how much they like you uva sounds very interesting though !, 
  how old is the university ? 
  because i assume its a very well known university yet i hear more about twente fazes muito bem !, 
  true dat !, 
  but macron won so there 's that  yes i see , honestly being objective is better , it 's fairer ( ? ), 
  what the hell ? 
  i kid you not but old people here that lived in france are actually sort of supporting her , because she is what france needs to still be france in the future they say ... 
  i will look into it  ahahah keep that up it will help you have awesome grades !, 
  yes , and if for some forsaken reason le pen wins ... lord . . 
  i watched the debate and she is out of touch with reality . . having francs for people and small companies but euros for the bigger ones ? 
  lol or mdr really ? 
  its fascinating !, 
  what else is different ? 
  cool !, 
  if you want we can talk about it !, 
  because here i bore everyone with my love for european matters xp me too !, 
  you are cool , i hope we can be friends !, 
  well , i see the point in it , why hide your ancestry ? 
  accents should be celebrated i know what you mean about the french government not taking the right measures when it comes to teaching languages in the best possible , but when they have such a big country and a big `` market '' , why do they need to learn more than the basics of other language ? 
  it feels like this is how they think i understand , you saw going away as way to.improve yourself and it was actually the best thing for you  hein ? 
  how are calculators different ?? 
  by writing conventions do you mean ponctuation or what do you mean ? 
  modesty is a great quality to have , and you have plenty !, 
  i wish you great success  so you are currently taking a bachelors ? 
  in european studies that 's very cool !!, 
  i am writing my dissertation ( masters ) about the community passport , its about banks being able to open branches in other member states with an authorization from their original state which valid for every country in the eu i can see you being very good with tourists , for one you seem to be amazed by different cultures and finding common ground , otherwise you would n't be a part of this forum  i work in a caf\u00e9 , i do more stuff but i dont know how to explain properly, 
  i always assumed that the whole `` the french only know french '' was a big joke because they had heavier accents when speaking english , after all its true to an extent ? 
  you went woth your mother but you were 16 , not everyone has the guts to leave everything behind like you did and start over !, 
  you left your friends , your home , your family ( ? 
  ) , and who knows what else i admire you because that 's something i would like to do but at the same time i do n't want to leave the confort of the things i know and am familiar with yes i see you really benefit from it !, 
  how can maths be affected by the language ? 
  with history and other social sciences i can see it happening but with maths ? 
  : s so you are pretty intelligent , maybe that 's why you can integrate and adapt so well in these 3 countries and in all the others you visit plus you seem to have actually learnt from your experiences like the `` denmark fail '' i really liked that last sentence you wrote , it was a great wrap up if you do n't mind me asking ( you dont have to answer if you feel like this is too personal to ask ) but in what field do you work on ? 
  i feel that for some reason you got unlucky with the teachers you got in portugal although i admit its pretty impressive the english part . . 
  i think its still falling short on us because i had english since 1st grade ( like 4 hours a week , maybe less in primary school ) and i always went to public schools . 
  i think it all depends on the students themselves and their willingness to study or to learn i 'm not try to take away the value of what you did , quite the contrary !, 
  i find it very impressive that you had the ability to see that you needed a better educational system and i wish i had the guts to go to another country to pursue my goals but after france why did you chose the netherlands ? 
  with belgium right there ? 
  specially considering you could use french instead of having to learn dutch and you are already slightly belgian with your 90 :p about walking on sidewalks i think you need to come visit my village where sidewalks are for the flies and the road is for everything , cars , bikes , people , electric wheelchairs i have yet to go to france and to the netherlands , so i dont understand one thing ... 
  should n't they be way more organized than we ? 
  and why are malls designed in incomprehensive ways ? 
  is it like a way to force people to pass by more stores and buy more stuff ? 
  where do you feel at home ? 
  where do you feel like you belong ? 
  interesting !, 
  and what was your conclusion when you changed ? 
  is france better than us in terms of education ? 
  why would you want kebabs when you can get bifanas or p\u00e3o com chouri\u00e7a ? 
   my mother grew up when france like almost everyone else from leiria but the way she tells it its like portugal is way better because there is more freedom to walk around in the streets , currently she claims to not remember french anymore but its weird since she only spoke french until she was 10 and sometimes you 'll catch her pronouncing `` talento '' as `` talant '', 
  i think napoleon might be seen that way in all the countries he invaded ? 
  did you go to school in both portugal and france ? 
  in which country did you spend more time ? 
  that 's so true !,

  fixed . 
  `` finisterra '' means `` end of the earth '' in latin , and is a well-known [ cape ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fisterra ) in galiza , spain . 
  the reason i use it is that portugal is , poetically and in our literature , known as the `` finis terra '' in terms of countries , i.e. 
  the face of europe looking west . 
  done !, 
  yeah , santos as well , nice spot , adding it . 
  i would need to get hard data for the portuguese one ; almeida is not particularly common imo ( it 's well-know , but not exactly what i would consider extremely common ) . 
  i would put all my money behind `` silva '' for the most common portuguese surname , and even gon\u00e7alves , fernandes , pereira , rodrigues , sousa and martins are imo more common ( or at least as common ) as pereira . 
  btw : * almeida : surname derived from the town of the same name , and adopted as surname by those who conquered it form the moors during the reconquest . 
  the word itself means `` plain land '' in arabic * silva : from the latin `` wood , forest '' , also adopted by a specific visigothic lineage in iberia . 
  also applicable to several locations that have it in the name . 
  * gon\u00e7alves : patronymic of gon\u00e7alo ( high german in origin , visigothic gundisalv ) * fernandes : patronymic of fernando and fern\u00e3o ( english ferdinand , visogothic frithunanths ) * pereira : `` pear tree '' in portuguese , but it is a surname derived from the estate with the same name in the xi century , home to one of the oldest nobility lineages * rodrigues : patronymic of rodrigo ( high german in originic , visigothic roderic ) * sousa : location-based in origin , from a visigothic family apparently ( at least in theory ) * martins : patronymic of martim ( english martin , from the latin martinus ) . 
  i 've read a lot about patronymics and matronymics and how they are common in some place today ; note that at least in portugal and spain a lot of the existing surnames have that origin and until relatively recently ( say , two centuries ) it was not at all uncommon . 
  edit : * santos : `` saints '' , a religious name , not specifically tied to a family but often given to those born on all saints , and from then on became a very popular surname . 
  * ferreira : `` blacksmith '' , but also an area with iron mines ( english `` ferrier '' is the most direct example in terms of the root of the word , and `` smith '' the one that is likely equivalent ) . 
  ( i i was going to post this as a new comment , but then saw yours and i think it fits better as a reply ) i 've been reading the comments , and apart from a ) questioning the graph because it does n't appear to suit some notions of who should be on top and that it must be due to corruption and b ) questioning the hygiene of northern europeans ... 
  i think it should be interesting to consider the economic incentive behind having good beaches ... 
  i am quite sure that in portugal beaches would be worse ( and imo they are quite good , with a lot of investiment made in terms of both water quality and also sand quality , with squads of teenage volunteers roaming around picking up garbage , cigarrete buts , etc ) if they were n't seen as an economic advantage ... and i do n't think that beaches in , say , belgium are exactly a tourist hotspot , mainly due to the weather . 
  things like keeping a `` blue flag '' are considered investments and come with mandatory regular measurements , etc. 
  beaches that are not used by people generally accumulate garbage and suffer in terms of water quality , and this is true even in countries with great weather , let alone in countries which do not view bathing sites as specifically worth the attention . 
  lakes otoh likely have different measurements that make them naturally look worse than oceanic beaches . 
  additionally i think that the concept of `` bathing site '' is relevant , since i would assume that this only includes areas with surveillance and which are `` legally '' defined as such . 
  actually picked that up when i was in denmark some years ago , so i did n't need to google-fu  i 'm really glad you found it interesting . 
  i did n't meant for it to be that long , but now that you answer it i got a similar feeling when i was in scandinavia , namely that danes seemed more expansive than swedes , and certainly than norwegians ( which i found to most reserved of all ) . 
  this could be something completely based on small sampling , but in any event if true it would also appear as `` odd '' to those who think that everything is the same north of the rhine , and are taken by surprise when each country has some specific `` feel '' to it , which is likely due to a long historic process that was not taken into consideration . 
  ps : talking about denmark made me remember the [ often forgotten joint-venture between denmark and portugal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jo%c3%a3o_vaz_corte-real ) which is shrouded in mystery :d, 
  not sure really , it 's part of the national character . 
  `` depressive '' is not entirely accurate , it 's more of a fatalist demeanour , a certain longing ... a `` nostalgia for when things were bad '' , in a way , since we seem to always admire the most tragic episodes . 
  i have no specific reason really , partially i think it is natural that different countries have a different demeanour ; while ethnically and culturally the iberian peninsula has more a continuum than anything else portugal has almost a millennia so it developed some particular characteristics that are generally not considered to fit the `` always happy , loud and filled with bravato '' southern european stereotype ( although we fit others , of course ) . 
  unamuno ( a spanish author , which i like very much ) has an entire book about it , although at the time he could also be reflecting the xix century zeitgeist that was still being somewhat felt ( `` cause of the decadence of the peninsular peoples '' and the like , basically an introspection into the causes of the shift of power from south to north ) . 
  this demeanour is the basis of some of the best and worst episodes , it 's almost as an hyper-valuing of the medieval chivalry ideals of suffering ( and indeed this sort of novels were always extremely influential ) and i think it is at least partially based on the notion of being a small country , surrounded by the atlantic and spain , that tries to aim farther . 
  note however that this fatalism is n't necessarily `` sadness '' . 
  an example : in [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_alc%c3%a1cer_quibir ) battle we lost a lot ... that being said , the supposed words of the king are still treasured as if they meant a victory . 
  as the legend goes , when everything was clearly lost , and after refusing any idea of surrender , king sebastian said `` my lords , my royal liberty will only be lost with my life '' . 
  the nobility accepted their fate , start advancing towards the enemy , and the king says ** `` to die ... yes , to die ... but slowly '' . 
  ** note that i 'm not sharing this as some sort of `` look how great it was !, 
  '' ; i am well aware that episodes like those are plenty in just about every country , or even more heroic ones . 
  what i find it interesting is the final sentence , since it conveys the soul-braking fatalism that affects us to this day . 
  fuck , now i 'm depressed , way to ruin my easter mate :(, 
  germany has an overall good image and most people admire what is called `` german efficiency '' . 
  since we have no specific historical hostility with germany itself there is little to affect the view of the germans themselves , most people think of them as slightly cold and detached but methodical . 
  above all people certainly have respect for what they perceive ( right or wrongly , and here you must understand that portuguese are probably the most depressive people in southern europe ) as the way germans were able to be reborn from the ashes and also how they seem to be able to have better politicians all around . 
  some say that the `` reborn from ashes '' is exactly why this is possible . 
  so , the opinion on the people itself is rather good i think . 
  ad for germany itself it is nowadays seen a bit as `` the eu '' , and i think most of the hostility comes from there . 
  people around here are well aware that sacrifices have to be made and also more than aware that asking for others to pay for `` our '' mistakes is wrong ( this is the universal opinion tbh ) ; having said that there is also the sentiment that a lot of what is being done is mostly to protect a certain development model that overwhelmingly benefits germany and that ultimately everything being done is part of that . 
  * a lot * of people are starting to think about the benefits of simply saying `` fuck it dude , let 's go bowling '' , with the idea that it would likely seriously affect most others and actually be better in the medium term . 
  merkel is seen by many as the culprit of the situation not because local government is n't at fault , but mostly because merker = = germany = = eu , and the way bailouts have austerity measures have been made are seen as a way to protect german banking and economy while at the same time appearing as a favour . 
  the `` merkel is hitler '' and `` germans are nazis '' is used by a small minority and would be used regardless of the situations since that is what most people think of when trying to be insulting towards germans . 
  it means little tbh . 
  one think that i have personalty been finding depressing ( and also affects the attitude on the street ) is that the news about how this situation is portrayed by the media in germany and other northern european countries is much more `` let 's play the victim and blame others '' than the one in portugal . 
  this in turn increases the sense of `` oh yeah ? 
  well , fuck you to , time stop caring about eu stability and just get out and see the circus burn '' . 
  others completely disagree and while agreeing in that the eu answer is inappropriate they say that anything outside the euro would be worse . 
  true , country as a brand is well worth investing since it increases the value of all your exports . 
  it would be funnier if it was being advertised as horse meat ... 
  still , article seems to stretch it a bit does n't it ? 
  goes from `` mystery mean in lamb curry in the uk '' to `` in spain it is rumoured that dogs are used in dog food '' . 
  for all we know the lamb curry could be of cat or ... ... ** soylent curry **, 
   sure i can . 
  there is one party that is far right that does n't like eu and not that fond of immigrants , and i did n't vote for them the previous election since i 'm not that fond right wing ideology but yeah in the next election i 'm going to vote for them unles another party decides to change their stance on eu . 
  similar reasons are used by those people that you seem to think love to elect corrupt government , i.e. 
  that outside of the existing ones there is no real choice . 
   but i can not do anything about what politicans other countries votes for and apparently a lot of eu countries loves corrupted politicans . 
  yeah , it 's a real delicacy , it 's like an addiction , everybody loves them around here . 
  you ca n't do nothing ? 
  you mean to say that wherever you live you ca n't vote on politicians that support your `` smaller version of the eu '' and stop giving out copious amounts of money for absolutely no gain ? 
  seems a bit fishy , are your sure they are n't being bribed by our big southern oligarchies and crime syndicates ? 
  just like all citizens of the countries undergoing financial crisis are blamed because `` they elected their government , it 's all their fault '' , in the same vein you elect your own governments , so if they keep financing so absolutely corrupt countries , well , it 's your fault . 
   i would gladly support a smaller version of eu where countries only are allowed to join if they have low corruption and does n't need handouts all the time . 
  then get at it , you 're all very special snow-flakes . 
  it 's not our fault that you do not elect politicians that represent what you consider your best interests . 
  for those that might think `` meh , an enclave , plenty of those around '' the above is key ... from the article :  apart from the main division ( called zondereigen from the main hamlet ) located north of the belgian town of merksplas , there are twenty belgian exclaves in the netherlands and three other sections on the dutch-belgian border . 
  there are also seven dutch exclaves within the belgian exclaves . 
  six of them are located in the largest one and a seventh in the second-largest one . 
  an eighth dutch exclave lies nearby ginhoven . 
  tl ; dr it seems that someone played mine sweeper and divided the squares between countries . 
  ufff , that is slightly less depressing , thank you . 
  btw , a quick analysis on the numbers seems to show that we are pretty much the same but some change in calculations modified the final result ; additionally unemployment is also affecting the index . 
  still , i think i speak for all of us when i say that i 'm ashamed of this numbers , particularly in items like child labour . 
  still , in the really important stuff ( education , health , lack of disparity , etc. ), 
  the forecast is actually not so good : there were a lot of improvements in the last four decades that were due to investment on public sectors ( e.g. 
  infant mortality was one of the highest , now it is one of the lowest ; the percentage of people which were not alphabetised was much higher and takes several generations to stop affecting the overall numbers , etc ) , exactly the ones which are now being dismantled . 
  i vote on `` amount of fish consumed '' . 
  that sounds like a typical anglo-saxon plan to divert attentions from the london-merkel banking conspiracy . 
  i 'm on to your lollardy . 
  your comment does n't really make sense ( or better yet , it comes out as very simplistic imo ) when the historical context is cinsidered . 
  there was little to no possibility of a longer process at the time , particularly with the cold war . 
  also , even hinting it was seen as fascist , colonial and racist since it implied that africans were n't ready for independence and needed supervision in order to bee refrained from destroying the country . 
  this in top of a war in which many people died and was going on for decades . 
  additionaly all other decolonisation processes where hardly to write home about . 
  at the time advocating anything less was seen as a colonial holdout . 
  not sure what that is but i blame the germans . 
  i 'm aware of that , i meant to specifically mention valencian since there are historical records comparing it with portuguese . 
  i am only superficially aware of the language controversy but in general i view it as the same language . 
  the same for mirandese - which is lionese - and portuguese and galician . 
  part of the problem , and i only remembered that with your reply , is that there is a big political aspect to these issues , either one likes it or not . 
  leave the eu , take the canolli . 
  thank you , that was interesting . 
  finnish is quite interesting , both in the written form and phonetics .

  you taught them well in your ways i see, 
  there 're plenty of people drinking their meia de leite in the afternoon ... 
  [ aljubarrota ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/battle_of_aljubarrota ) & nbsp ; seriously though : & nbsp ; -- what is the ego ? 
  it 's the small spaniard inside each of us & nbsp ; -- what 's the world 's most profitable business ? 
  to buy a spaniard for what he 's worth and sell him for what he thinks he is . 
  & nbsp ; the spanish pm , in an official visit to portugal , was visiting a primary school . 
  before he arrived , the director prepared the students to properly recieve him . 
  -- now , you must be polite to mr. rajoy . 
  jo\u00e3ozinho , i 'll be asking what spain is to us , and you say that spain is our friend . 
  -- no , mr. director , spain is our brother . 
  but you need n't say so much . 
  just say that they are our friends . 
  -- no , and no , spain 's our brother country . 
  -- ok jo\u00e3ozinho ... but why do you think that they 're our brothers and not our friends ? 
  -- because friends , we can pick our own !, 
  & nbsp ; [ note , portuguese kids in jokes are always called jo\u00e3ozinho , lit . 
  little john ], 
  yeah ... the dinner time news starts at 20:00 and that 's a fairly common dinnertime , albeit on the early side of things but it 's not that odd for people to start eating at 21:00 , or even later if with friends, 
  it happens a bit across the whole south of europe , so i 'd say it 's probably either because it 's warmer at night , or because days are longer in the winter . 
  nevertheless , other night related things , like dinner also tend to happen later on the more south you go . 
  nope , just look at the country flag . 
  looks nothing like italy 's, 
  why would i be from italy !, 
   first place goes to your own people , second place goes to your closes alies ( ... ) third place goes to your `` normal `` allies for political reasons . 
  i used to think this goes without saying . 
  it 's just basic human nature to care more for those closer to you . 
  your family member dying is a tragedy , a family member of a friend is sad and someone you do n't know , well is life . 
  we just ca n't possibly care for everyone everywhere the same . 
  i wish we could , but it 's hypocritical to say so . 
   not only do they do nothing for their own people , there are millions of starving children all over europe that are ignored for the sake of the refugees . 
  thing is , they are not ignored for the sake of refugees . 
  when greece 's and our own economy tanked , german efforts went not to directly help us , or our poor , but to ensure we would n't drag them down with them . 
  and in our case , part of the problem was their fault , because by refusing steps for a financial union and equity of tax payment inside the eurozone , they greatly lowered borrowing costs while at the same time crippling our exportation capacity ( because 200x stronger currency ) and blocking our efforts to control capital escape and tax readjustments . 
  part of the reason they threw money at us in the previous decades without having any control was for stopgap purposes . 
  they payed people to close their farms and fishing activities with simple injections of cash ( i wish i was joking , but this is literally what they did . 
  oh the protectionism ) so that they 'd invest that money in buying finished goods from them , giving a boost to themselves and artificial liquidity to us . 
  when that ended , we had to turn to those even more artificially low interest rates to keep financing ourselves . 
  so even if there were no refugees , they would n't help our poor that much , because they 're not interested in that , nor will that grant them votes, 
  hey , just because orban is pushing for non democratic reforms , which appall me , it does not mean that he does n't have a point in here . 
  i really , really like schengen . 
  and i would like for the union to continue . 
  but if we ditch our internal borders , we need to get our shit together and have a external border . 
  it just wo n't work otherwise . 
  & nbsp ;  `` solidarity means helping people who are in danger where they live , and helping them to return home once the conflict is finished , '' this is so bloody true i do n't know where to start . 
  it 's [ way ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/diminishing_returns ) more effective to create infrastructure in the first place , than to expand it ad hoc . 
  also , without improving the situation in poor countries , birth rates [ will ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpjzfgchgle ) negate any amount we can ever take in . 
  it 's just how geometric growth works , nothing surprising . 
  also , it 's much easier to integrate people in countries with similar cultures and economic levels . 
  employing [ unskilled ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3wzxat/report_reveals_most_syrian_refugees_are/ ) manpower in post industrial societies , where even factory workers need the 12th year and extra formation is nigh impossible . 
  in a similarly devolved country to their own , not so much . 
  & nbsp ;  `` stupidity is letting hundreds of thousands of people -- millions -- into europe with no controls , while everyone , europeans and migrants alike , can see they 'll never get what they hoped for here , '' once again , true . 
  this clusterfrack is a like a postmodern trail of tears , with people dying in troves on the way to the promised land of milk and honey . 
  it 's disgusting to let it happen in the first place . 
  i 'd be all for a screening in camps outside the eu , under an well established protocol and distribution system , to have quotas of people from these places come . 
  that way we could still ease some of the burden , while filtering violent , extremist , or too [ dissonant ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/valuesdissonance ) individuals and prioritizing endangered minorities like the [ yazidi ] ( http://proof.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/24/women-escaped-slavery-isis-sinjar/ ) on a more pragmatic note , and quoting from a [ previous ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3vwt04/ammunition_is_propaganda_found_after_france/cxrejsa ) post of mine , [ this ] ( http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/gborjas/publications/journal/jel2015.pdf ) is a great eye opener . 
  it explains how income is bound to fall for the lower and middle class only to hugely increase for the upper class with massive influx of migrants ( tl ; dr think of it as the reverse of what happened in the black plague , too much manpower to employ ) . 
  and being for policy that screws the poor in favour of the rich is a very right wing thing to do actually . 
  so it surprises me that only strongly right wing people like orban stand against these policies . 
  & nbsp ; also , there are many stupid things we do , we could be doing in a much better way , like creating fledgling economies in refugee camps by employing that unskilled manpower in added value jobs . 
  we could do that by also sending them raw goods ( grain instead of bread , cloth instead of clothes ) , which are way cheaper , easier to storage and take longer to spoil and employ them in processing that , which would not only help take away their minds from the awful situation they 're in , but help give them a sense of meaning . 
  in the end , yes . 
  we are being very stupid in handling this crisis , and we could be doing way better . 
  for both their and our own sake, 
  true , but only if they were catholics . 
  if they were not converted it was fair game . 
  it is also a reason why the portuguese and the spaniards had some grievances with some religious orders in the new world , because they tried to convert slaves and thus remove manpower from indenture . 
   and pronounce `` sh '' instead of `` s '' . 
  instead of saying `` spain is a nation '' he says `` spain ish a nation '' . 
  maybe [ portuguese ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bpxf5tv.png ) influences ? 
  and it 's not like museums have a duty to record history as it was , instead of as we wish it had been . 
  remember when the catholic church cut off or added fig leaves to the penises on the artworks in the vatican ? 
  right this must be the horseshoe theory of prudish idiocy ... 
  and also ourselves ... 
  but doing so , the pipe also serves more people , earning more revenue . 
  combined with the costs i said above , it more than offsets that, 
  every part , including germany . 
  the costs for building and maintaining underwater pipes is much higher than that of those that go above ground, 
  you understand you can do that way more cheaply with a pipe that does not go by sea or skirt poland and the baltic states right ? 
  the fact it does proves it 's only a way to let them be cut without affecting germany, 
  everyone must share the burden of the waves of migrants coming to us , because europe means solidarity , so -- what 's that , russia 's acting all jingoistic again ? 
  do n't worry about it my eastern bros , we got your backs and -- so you know about the stream ? 
  awkward ... nevermind that . 
  it 's just some silly big boys business . 
  and besides , [ when ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/first_partition_of_poland ) did [ we ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/second_partition_of_poland ) ever [ plot ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/third_partition_of_poland ) with [ the ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/congress_of_vienna ) russians [ to ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/krak%c3%b3w_uprising ) screw [ you ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/november_uprising ) over , [ huh ? 
  ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ), 
   simply noting that portugal , at least thus far , did n't complain we simply wo n't . 
  we 're a country of soft habits , and it takes a whole lot to make us complain, 
  initially the quota was to be of 1k . 
  it was depressingly entertaining to see how the number slightly increased each evening at the news . 
  looked like the guy asking 100 , i mean 50 $ to his father but on reverse . 
  also , despite accepting the quota , only about 50 accepted coming so far . 
  people want to be in dc countries and that 's them apples ... 
  but all in all , the smoke still looks fairly distant as of now for us . 
  it 's not a issue for us right now , and in the elections earlier this autumn it was barely mentioned apart from standard answer 3-b : * we must help the people in need *, 
  can that lovely solidarity also apply to our sovereign debt , or does it only work to protect some when it 's hitting the fan ? 
  [ i 'm not saying soldiers ] ( https://i.imgflip.com/vx51b.jpg ), 
  it 'd be too close to braga on the map . 
  not a prudent decision, 
  it sounds like simlish, 
  the sh sounds came from a fairly more recent sound change which made most s sounds in the coda of the syllable to become sh .

  it 's pronounced as kasutera but castilla the kingdom is pronounced slightly differently ( though most people will have no idea what that is ) . 
  i have no idea how the hell that happened . 
  in japan or portugal ? 
  the deck of cards used in portugal came from the french deck but in japan they still use decks that came from the old portuguese one , that most people ( myself included until recently ) do n't even know existed . 
  dude . 
  chill out !, 
  it was clearly banter . 
   playing cards cards that they still use and we have n't used in over 100 years . 
   we should do a cultural exchange program where you get fish oil .

  most likely not . 
   everyone is suddenly gone and does siesta no fucking way !, 
  no one does that . 
  geographically there is n't a piece of portugal that borders the mediterranean . 
  culturally it is a mediterranean country . 
  no doubt there . 
  edit : portugal is mediterranean as finland is scandinavian . 
   most of the locals that i met told me brazil gives no fucks about portugal , true  and portuguese people would love to go there to work . 
  lol .

   yeah , sorry about that pink flag thing pink * map * . 
   sometimes sounds like russian as a native speaker i have to agree .

  portugal was a founding member of nato as a dictatorship .

  i can just take the bus , have multiple departure times , pay 20 eur and not have to put up with chitchat with anyone for 3 hours . 
  and i get wifi plus larger bags ( not that i carry much ) . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  portuguese people are always like this . 
  buying second hand stuff is the same shit . 
  it 's just cheaper to buy new . 
  it 's like they think because a portuguese touched it somehow increases in value .

  there 's a significant difference between weather in the south and north .

  had they not been born and none of this would have happened . 
  people that were successful otherwise it 's the inverse . 
   sorry , but less than 1 % of men dominating in powerful positions does n't really change anything for the rest of us . 
  apex fallacy . 
  just because more men occupy the top echelons of society does n't mean that overall they do n't have it worse . 
   brits did what every_feckin_else on the planet tried to do for millennia . 
  but they were more efficient . 
  it 's the same with all colonial powers . 
   we resent you for being more efficient in doing what we would like to have done !, 
  got it . 
  so you claim the crisis just exacerbated whatever small differences already existed . 
  makes sense , i guess . 
  well , they are starting from a pretty bad starting position . 
  so you claim high inequality in iceland , correct ? 
   most do . 
  look at the top restauraunts , top 10 , i think 7 or 8 are english . 
  i 'll definitely have a look now .

  countries are not as flexible , hence the needed regulation . 
  right now , both are incompatible and only few will remain standing unless action ( regulation ) is taken . 
  you ask of the debtors and rightly so but the creditors are not suicidal . 
  they know when enough is enough and when to back off over risk of losing 100 % of investments . 
  it 's a country 's or eu negotiation power and skills that can make the difference here . 
  haircuts can be negotiated as can time-frames and even rules . 
  ofcourse it is n't being negotiated because banksters own the world 's legislative process and make sure 100 % debt is paid in full . 
  but as you 've witness with greece , they took a haircut when facing higher losses , which means they bleed as well . 
  it is n't a conspiracy . 
  it is a natural expectation in the final days of a predatory capitalist society - ever increasing power and wealth to those who already have it . 
  as an example of how bad things are just look at portugal . 
  we have a imf loan of 5.5 % and a negative growth . 
  we need to grow more than 5 % a year to cope with those rates . 
  even on a 15 year time-frame , it is impossible . 
  there are no predictions that in the coming decade we 'll be controlling the deficit and growing enough as the brics !, 
  it 's insane !, 
  why then , did they loan in the first place ? 
  because of the many measures that the imf imposes . 
  privatization of social security , health services , water , land and power companies . 
  that and making sure the money flows towards the banks and 12bn have already flowed in their way from an 80bn loan . 
  the future is corporatization . 
  financial clusters owning entire countries and their citizens , dictating policies and exerting total-control over everything . 
  why ? 
  i do n't know ... for eons that conquering has been a human trait and power corrupts everything . 
  could also be a natural thing to occur in a capitalist society . 
  all past civilizations fell . 
  but we still have a chance to balance things out and that is within our current and rapidly closing time-frame . 
  if we do nothing we 'll deserve whats coming . 
  sure we can blame it on the leaders and even on the people . 
  but the thing is that the much needed eu prevention mechanisms have all failed !, 
  not just with greece but with may other countries and even those economically sound like france or germany . 
  we enabled the deregulated market and brought about all these vulnerabilities . 
  we are now at the mercy of large funds that own and speculate at will !, 
  and wherever they go the investing sheep follow . 
  but there 's a much bigger elephant in the room !, 
  the ammount of debt in the north-western hemisphere is unpayable . 
  the whole system is an unsustainable ponzi scheme bound to blow up anytime now and we 're quickly reaching that black hole of debt 's event horizon . 
  the barely seen itsy bitsy dot of darker color ovelapping central lisbon coincides with the crooked politicians that make up our central government and parliament . 
  everyone else is choking on debt and ramping prices . 
  this map tells the tale of the last 30 years in portugal - 2 political parties pocketing eu money . 
  on a eu wide level i see the eu crisis going further and further down the spiral . 
  i see greece defaulting and exiting the euro along with countrywide rioting and misery . 
  we 'll be witnessing it live without being willing to do anything about it . 
  portugal may or may not go the same way . 
  it 's touch and go . 
  france and germany will be speared by two new heads of state , even less willing to compromise in light of crippling bailouts and their political frailty . 
  this means no agreements and no federalization . 
  it 's a terrible scenario that will unfold by the end of 2012 and into 2013 . 
  more and more economic depression and the dissolution of the old eu into a smaller northern core , still with the euro . 
  southern countries will be forced to reintroduce their old currencies and partially default on their debt . 
  it will mean very hard times for the south . 
  prices will soar and our economies will take a  50 % hit . 
  in the us , obama wins the reelection but remains tied by congress and other interests . 
  there will be another bubble bursting - student loans ; and string of bailouts due to european debt exposure . 
  i doubt bank of america survives 2012 along with the dollar as it currently stands . 
  a war with iran is a near certainty . 
  iran does n't stand a chance and will be forced into submission either by israel alone or by the us . 
  this will make some commodities soar and countries topple in europe . 
  china will experience a real estate bubble and a slowing of its industrial output as well as growth but will remain in control of it . 
  it 's a rigid political system ruling over a submissive people already used to authoritarian regimes . 
  china will invest in southern europe making scooping up bargain after bargain in the newly privatized energy sectors . 
  in portugal i foresee even more austerity along with the usual politician 's hypocrisy , as our government continues its corrupt favoring of the elite few . 
  unemployment will hit 20 % ( which really means 40 % ) and starvation will happen . 
  more and more people will turn to farming . 
  regular clashes regarding tax dodging and parallel economies will occur with the police . 
  the current right winged ministers are prone to exert violence over the population and that will happen often as it did in the past . 
  there will mass protesting but crushed by the police . 
  most people will eventually give up and many young will emigrate to brics and former colonies . 
  some banks will go bust . 
  health and social security will be fully privatized . 
  a military coup might be discussed but will be crushed . 
  the majority we 'll be entering 2013 much leaner than one year before . 
  i 'd just like to point out that no court has jurisdiction over americans . 
  once americans have their prisoners made , there is no legal frame to indict americans into handing them over or even make them respect whatever conventions . 
  they do , however , expect other countries to give in to human rights demands . 
  it 's an unparalleled hypocrisy . 
  which in turn will make the prices of basic commodities , oil and food soar and thus kill eu exports even further . 
  the future , however short-lived , belongs to the brics . 
  the downgrade reflects something that should be more than obvious by now . 
  the economy growth is in the negative . 
  exports are in the red and ~ ~ some ~ ~ all countries need to finance themselves in regular intervals at interest rates far superior than they are growing . 
  not even imf loans can be repaid if the economy does n't grow above 5 % which is ridiculous and totally unexpectable for the next 10 years . 
  none of all this eu debt will ever be fully repaid . 
  the obvious need for massive and simultaneous haircuts worldwide will eventually push the current economic model off the cliff . 
  hateful comments bashing southern europe in 3 , 2 , 1 ... 
  irrelevant . 
  the deutsche mark is the markets endgame for this matter . 
  the message seems quite clear and it 's `` i 'm betting on the fall of the euro and prefer my money to be * converted * into a strong currency '' . 
  can you even read properly ? 
  i 've got nothing against germans !, 
  do n't reduce this to a north vs. south or against some paranoid 4th reich antics . 
  i criticize predatory capitalism and big capital players !, 
  i criticize inaction , nonsensical legislation , corrupted institutions and paid politicians . 
  try to develop some sensitivity or empathy for those in mid-austerity . 
  it pays off !, 
  if you do n't , it will be at your door soon enough , because right after we 're done , you 'll be next . 
  and this is more probable than any market prophecy . 
  it 's disgusting how you hinted portuguese flags as * pests * on this board . 
  oh , do n't be so self-victimizing . 
  it 's inconsistent with what you 're even saying !,

  these lands are sometimes either insured or their contents are later sold , sometimes forcefully in wholesale , towards paper mills . 
  even the element of laziness plays a part . 
  fire cleans the land quickly and makes for better grazing lands . 
  about half of the `` firestarters '' are local idiots that like being on the news and the whole adrenaline/crisis scenario . 
  some work as voluntary fire-fighters . 
  but the thick of the causes are criminal and man made . 
  you just could n't resist bashing the portuguese people by generalizing us as idiots with poor taste . 
  i mentioned foreigners in portugal because the article addressed just that . 
  it had nothing to do with critique . 
  they 're more than welcome and if they wish to resort to traditional ways , the better . 
  but let me tell you this : i regularly head back to the outback all over the country . 
  i see a lot of the old ways in building techniques being used not by foreigners but by educated portuguese . 
  shale stone , granite and other forms of stone housing . 
  villages being put to tourism use . 
  farms are being used again and projects being developed to exploit the land once again . 
  the government abandons rural areas because there is no immediate profit in them and governments are typically weak and efemerous , only accountable to their sponsors and the financial and consumerist industries ... 
  but [ the coming zero marginal cost society that is currently replacing capitalism is slowly realizing and seizing those rural farming areas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-iducetjvo ) . 
  they will be priceless in the near future . 
  living in the outback is very rewarding and profitable as well . 
  in the current paradigm of self-sufficiency ( wells , solar and wind energy ) . 
  there are n't deterrents anymore . 
  it 's one of my goals to have such a place for myself and my immediate family . 
  as for forest fires , i can assure 90 % or more are criminal . 
  how magnanimous of them ... how about they pay their god damn taxes , like i do , instead of weaseling through tax havens and accounting acrobatics ? 
  miserably lacking article ... no pictures , no interview , hardly anything of substance . 
  in portugal there are quite a few dutch danes and germans living in the outback . 
  educating their kids themselves and living off the land . 
  it helped that their initial purchasing power was immense . 
  i too often wish for similar and simpler life , closer to nature and on a much slower pace . 
  most likely compensating for something that 's lacking . 
  you wo n't be jobless . 
  you and all of us here will be conscripted eventually . 
  apologist ... 
  the articles about merkel are so childish . 
  it 's like she 's a benign almost retarded figure of sorts . 
  that woman is ruthless !, 
  nothing she does is without serious thought and to suppose germany is lagging behind in the surveillance and counter intelligence department is ridiculous and has been disproved by leaked collaborations and mass citizen spying programs . 
  you do n't get to be a top economy without learning how to protect it effectively . 
  china is a serious threat but i 'm pretty sure there 's more than adequate german counter measures . 
  your point being ? 
  means stoneage fucktard . 
  means fundamentalist . 
  islamists doing what they do best ... 
  anyone who believes south african society has a future is delusional . 
  the black on white crime is through the roof . 
  i would n't raise a family there even if they paid me in diamonds . 
  interests paid by the people and companies ... learn your banking . 
   it will be a hard sell for germans , but their political class wants it and disbanding the eu is imposible without crashing most western economies and seriously distabilsing smaller economies . 
  and in time war . 
  at the very least preceded by embargoes , sanctions and other silly grievances . 
   currency doesnt matter , credit matters . 
  currency does matter !, 
  a lot in fact . 
  we have a disproportionally high purchasing power and being fed by high interest rates and racking debt . 
  portugal has doubled it 's external debt due to this . 
  we are living in a unaffordable world geometrically progressing towards some debt apocalypse and complete collapse of the euro . 
  it is being done by design , german design ... 
  they will bolt out with the cash and holding title to to our assets and we 'll be left bordering civil war . 
   absolutely , because they can afford it , the pay taxes regularly and meticulously , irrelevant . 
  their hegemonious economy comes from the marshall plan and rebuilding momentum generated in the second half of the xx ^ th century . 
  they paid no interests and had debt erased . 
  unlike other countries . 
  but i concede , they totally worked for it . 
  my grief is towards their modern day selfishness and calculistic exploitation of people it should be united with . 
  and i do n't meanthem doing us favors , giving money or turning a blind eye . 
  germany is actively screwing southern europe . 
  this has xenophobic roots , like it or not . 
   you do n't have the political class negesary . 
  this is a pessimistic and racist view that is precisely in the german agenda . 
  necessity will force change . 
  we will come out on top . 
  i have to try at least . 
  there is no better alternative and i do n't like or trust the german bloc . 
  it 's better than suffering chronically from economic tuberculosis until we are finished . 
  it will all implode anyway soon . 
  if we do it now , and leave the euro and the eu , before we become over indebted and have to fight our way out of this . 
  we might still have a chance of making it . 
  besides , the eu strangles our economy , limiting it , in terms of resource exploitation , fishing farming and other deficits so as to favor other stronger countries . 
  lobbying trumps reason . 
  strength , power and wealth trump any form of justice , equality or `` brotherly '' behavior amongst states . 
  it 's natural law and no social pact is respected anymore . 
  wealth is n't distributed but hoarded . 
  countries cannibalizing each other . 
  this is no union . 
  it 's a gang . 
  federal dreams imply shared budgeting concerns . 
  it also should imply fiscal union and a eu wide normalization . 
  this wo n't ever happen as it would mean the wealth would shift from north to south in a very short time . 
  think german reunification . 
  each country for themselves , cannibalizing each other is in no way a precursor to a federal eu . 
  ideally , spending power is at it 's optimum if we account for the current imbalances . 
  the south holds a strong currency and is able to purchase german goods but has very little to back it up and no control over the economy . 
  it 's an unsustainable situation though and it 's showing just that as there are huge deficits , a recession and no prospects of recovery , at least not in the debt market . 
  this is showing by racking up huge external debts which will be our problem . 
  these add to the imbalance and serve to weaken us . 
  it 's not stopped and we 're still in the euro because we ca n't leave . 
  germany doens ' t let us leave . 
  it urges us to consume further german goods , despite the huge external debt . 
  once thet get as much from us as they can , we 'll be booted out . 
  on the other hand , germany gets low or even negative interest rates issuing future debt .

over 200 million , very few countries exist nevermind football underachievers . 
  for particular definitions of caring , china and the usa do care , or at least would love to do ok , at least not worse than holland , at something the rest of world values . 
  over 100 million , russia cares . 
  mexico does care . 
  japan , kind of , particularly when playing at home . 
  not quite 100 million , but close and they do care very very much , turkey . 
  iran as well , i think . 
   i can not help myself !, 
  what else are you supposed to do do when you make eye contact with people accidentally ? 
  or need to , you know , interact ? 
  ( not totally joking here , random smiles from strangers are kind of random communication that despite being forced to share the same space , we are not aggressive to each other and are willing to cooperate , in for example , bad mouthing any random queue jumper , politician , football referee , random bureaucrat or slightly unusual weather phenomena in our shared way . 
  you can not just start talking about the weather ! ), 
  i get it , i get about loving to hate . 
  but imo your record in the 1970s versus the 2010s is not seeming all that different . 
  and pity all those countries with hundreds of millions of people and lots of money listening to you complain about how disappointing your national football team is !, 
  it is sounding like that , yes , 
  you sure you are not finnish ? 
  poor you . 
  just the semifinals this last time , yeah , it \u00b4 s admittedly a worsening of performance . 
  and you guys hardly ever had any fun along the way , say like a match against highly hyped reigning champions at the time widely considered to be best team ever ( lol ) . 
  your shocking underachievement in football , might be better understood if compared to say china , india , even russia and the usa . 
  australia who is so `` sporty '' . 
  nigeria and just about almost all the rest of the world might have some feelings about it as well . 
  i mean this gently , because i am sympathetic , honestly , but get some perspective . 
  poor you . 
  just 2 world cup semifinals ( or finals ) in the last 4 years . 
  how many world cup finals ever ? 
  shocking underachieving for a country of 15 million people . 
  ( yo india , indonesia , china , lol . 
  russia , holland thinks they their national football team achievements are shit , how does that make you guys feel ? 
  china , how is that qualification ambitions going ? ), 
  queue jumpers . 
  politicians . 
  football referees . 
  ah , i get now what the person above meant . 
  i never been really far north when it \u00b4 s really close to summer solstice . 
  even when i have been to scandinavia in summer , worse was maybe sun rising about 4 and setting at about 10 , which was not too bad for me . 
   but the constant sunlight really messes with your head . 
  i honestly never had a problem with that . 
  it gets dark again at night anyway . 
  but maybe the longest period i ever experienced of blue skies and sunshine might be some 3 , 4 months - a dry summer or this famously dry winter we once had . 
  it has its drawbacks , all that sunshine is usually a sign of drought . 
  but sunshine on itself , not a problem . 
  particularly in winter . 
  the heat , real heat , particularly when it does not cool down ( say get below 25 ) at night , that does mess with you . 
  sunshine , no , i did not even know it could . 
  they do this shocking concept to a southerner which is they heat their houses , all of the house , all the time even when they are not there . 
  even after some experience with the concept , it \u00b4 s still kind of shocking ( kidding mostly , but i kind of expect to pay the same for electricity year round and do , i do use air conditioning a bit in summer and winter but not a lot ) . 
  in fact imo they kind of go overboard with the heating a bit , and heat the houses too much , so it \u00b4 s too dry and you are almost happy to come into the cold for a walk and get fresh ( really really fresh ) air . 
  an old portuguese joke - portuguese emmigrants in france and switzerland do not come to portugal for christmas because it \u00b4 s too cold in portugal that time of the year !, 
  ( though on the mountain northernmost areas they actually build and use central heating ) . 
  northern europe and winter , it \u00b4 s not the cold which is hard , it \u00b4 s the lack of sun which would really really upset me . 
   as for ground forces they would have a hard time disguising themselves to cross all of europe ... well , zenit is going to come play in lisbon soon ...  so maybe not just the air force and navy will have all the fun , maybe the police will have as well !, 
  yesterday there was a bunch of people proudly wearing jerseys with gazprom written there in big big letters ( but poor things , they were shivering , and had a disappointment . 
  they were presumably german anyway ) . 
  you are right , it \u00b4 s not about a real threat , it \u00b4 s about trying to intimidate . 
  which only works if people are intimidated ... 
  it would be fun to see how brazillian supervisors and crews would react to visiting their ship being built on the white sea , just off the arctic ocean . 
  actually maybe dilma should give hollande a call ... they will not get a better bargain . 
  not quite the same thing , but will be much cheaper . 
  i am actually impressed at the mistral ships , one built from scratch in 3 years or less and for less than a billion dollars . 
  oh , india , india ... 
  the article is fantastic , all of it . 
  patterns of drinking score - 3 to both out of a scale of 1 to 5 . 
  years of life lost score , on a scale of 1 to 5 , where 5 is bad korea - 5 ireland - 5 hmmm ... 
  iirc the regulations posted below coastal country also has control over maritime research equipment in its eez . 
  i presume they could order them out and might have done . 
  i absolutely agree - i have no interest that finland should join or not . 
  their problem , their choice . 
  and not even sure if nato wants it to join it . 
  it was just the gist of these comments kind of struck me as funny . 
  but as i said before , not really sure what this guy actually , in practical terms , wants the west to do . 
  i think i was trying to read too much into it - from thread and article title and comments here i was expecting something deep and insightful and it is just disconnected random spin . 
  i understand what you are saying about orders to shoot , it is just it still strikes me as an undignified way to avoid making a threat . 
  thanks , that was a good summary . 
  i am still a bit confused by how to conciliate not being humiliating to russia ( presumably nato joining of vassal states ) and drawing a line for russia in georgia and elsewhere - would not interfering there would have been far more humiliating ? 
  but this whole article is confusing . 
  i thought i was the only one !, 
  i * think * what he is saying is `` finland , we good at knowing russians , listen to us !, 
  '' , but then he says nothing . 
  maybe he is saying `` we are totally not joining nato just to help you guys out !, 
  your border with russia would double and we would not want to hurt the feelz of the russians , see ? 
  we are doing it to help you guys . 
  it \u00b4 s a plan ! '' . 
  i think that is what he is saying . 
  if i understood what he was saying , maybe i would listen . 
  i read that carefully and have no idea what the fuck he wants nato to do . 
  i do not understand the article very well - maybe this makes sense in finnish context , any help ? 
   and the hornets were flying alongside the russian planes ... the russians turned back . 
  if they had not , what would we have done ? 
  i would not speculate . '' maybe this is a language issue . 
  but he is the president of finland . 
  even if it \u00b4 s not his constitutional role to decide these things ( in our case , in our airspace , it would not the president , it would be the decision of the minister of defense . 
  outside our territorial airspace otoh only the president would be able to give the order to shoot down ) surely he will not need to speculate , since he would know how much the defense forces have been instructed to tolerate ? 
  is nobody telling him what the policies are ?!, 
   we ca n't change geography . 
  we have a 1,300 km border . 
  that is more than all other eu countries together . 
  the nato-russia border would be doubled [ if finland joined ] . 
  we have to consider that too .

  [ no , it 's not .

  i 'm not even brazilian portuguese and i miss it too . 
  it 's the one thing i would have introduced from brazilian orthography to european pt orthography . 
  and now they took it from both of us . 
  not really no . 
  our orthography changed more because it kept more of it 's etymological origins but theirs got fucked up too .

  so , i guess this as good proof as any that we are a rich powerful country . 
  olivenza/oliven \u00e7a is another matter for portuguese irredentists , since they feel that the city is legitimately portuguese . 
  it 's very unlike galicia , whose nobility portugal [ fought for it 's independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_s%c3%a3o_mamede ) . 
   portugalicia is only relevant among portuguese nationalists portugalicia is irrelevant among portuguese nationalists, 
  the alentejo got actually [ slightly larger ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olivenza ) . 
  yeah , the [ shoe industry in portugal ] ( http://www.portugueseshoes.pt/ ) in particular is pretty big . 
  as a soon to be architect i find that project silly and gimmicky . 
  and the spaniards did n't incorporate them ? 
  that 's very similar to my case . 
  i 'm from lisbon , speak portuguese natively , english fluently , spanish ( proper spanish , not portu\u00f1ol ) quasi-fluently and i started learning german one year ago , i can only hold a simple conversation so far . 
  i also know the basics in french although i would n't say i can speak or understand much of it . 
   you would n't find houses like that being used as public housing for the locals in need . 
  i do n't know man , contemporary social housing in portugal is pretty nice , i guess if your are thinking about social housing from the 60s through the 90s it can be pretty dismal , although even in that era there were some amazing social housing projects , like many of the saal process during the prec years . 
  according to [ this article ] ( http://www.dinheirovivo.pt/economia/os-10-concelhos-mais-pobres-de-portugal-que-todos-os-ministros-deviam-conhecer/ ) from 2013 the poorest municipality in portugal was [ sernancelhe ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=sernancelhe&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewju68r6oa_jahxfobokham1booq_auibygb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=955 ) , but that 's just a small village . 
  the poorest city , by the official definition in portugal , was [ valpa\u00e7os ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=valpa%c3%a7os&amp;hl=en-pt&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=955&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewjsg-drsq_jahvdcbokhcbqdhmq_auibigb ) . 
  he went away , this article is already two weeks old . 
  the new pm has been appointed and will be sworn in on friday . 
  including the high speed rail line connecting two of the three largest cities in the peninsula ? 
  edit : btw i do n't see the connection between that strike and poor investments in new rail lines . 
  that article says they went on strike because an agreement could n't be reached in regards to collective bargaining , human resources and their hiring policies . 
  what 's you point ? 
  yes , in that case it was n't needed , it was a terrible investment . 
  but we are n't talking about that airport are we ? 
  we are talking about a bridge that will be used in the future high speed rail line between madrid and lisbon . 
  that railway line will need plenty of expensive infrastructures in the middle of nowhere like this bridge . 
  you know that being built in an underpopulated area does n't necessarily mean it 's not needed ? 
  one day this bridge will be used to connect madrid and lisbon by high speed train . 
  it 's not exactly a white elephant . 
  and constructing bridges in the middle of nowhere is necessary in iberia since there are so many empty areas in between the big cities . 
  i thought it would be either [ soldado milh\u00f5es ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/an%c3%adbal_milhais ) or [ afonso de albuquerque ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afonso_de_albuquerque ) . 
  also xavier or hern\u00e2ni . 
  tbf , they probably got around as much as everyone else in iberia , it 's just that their names are more conspicuous than the rest . 
  if a rodrigues moved to spain he might change his name to rodr\u00edguez since they are so similar , and it 's harder to tell where exactly in the peninsula each name started . 
  in portugal we have at least : franco ( frank ) ingl\u00eas ( english ) m\u00e2ntua ( mantova , italy ) arag\u00e3o ( aragon , spain ) vasques ( son of vasco or basque ) vasconcelos ( basque ) mourinho/moura/mour \u00e3o ( moor ) \u00c1vila ( \u00c1vila , spain ) samora ( zamora , spain ) biscaia ( biscay , spain ) romana , rom\u00e3o ( roman ) albuquerque ( albuquerque , spain ) china ( china ) de holanda ( holland , netherlands - more common in brazil ) alorna ( alorna , goa ) de lencastre ( lancaster , england ) my own last name comes from the name of a small village somewhere in galicia , but that is a bit like cheating since galician and portuguese have always been pretty close , a great number of portuguese surnames of toponymic origin are galician-portuguese . 
  we probably also use \u00ef , but it 's not the case of na\u00efve . 
  [ na\u00efve ] ( https://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/na%c3%afve ) is [ not ] ( http://www.infopedia.pt/dicionarios/lingua-portuguesa/na%c3%afve ) a word in portuguese . 
  we actually do use it but only in words of foreign origin like [ m\u00fclleriano ] ( http://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/m%c3%bclleriano ) . 
  no , they are n't divided in regions unlike the others that are divided in nuts1 regions . 
  you can read it in the map 's legend . 
  [ is n't it the same ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ef_english_proficiency_index ), 
  it 's a pity that the uk , france , germany and portugal are n't divided in regions . 
  was n't this the same study that put portugal behind spain last year ? 
  ** half ** of the us speaks spanish ** fluently ** ? 
  maybe it 's my problem . 
  maybe i 'm spoiled with our amazing towels and just do n't know it because i 've never used average quality towels . 
  well , obviously this applies to the obsession spaniards have with portuguese towels . 
  i do n't know what kind of shitty towels they have there that they all want to buy our perfectly normal towels here . 
  do a street art tour in lisbon . 
  he has a point though , portugal was for many decades one of the european countries with the smallest shares of building renovations compared to the total number of construction projects . 
  we simply ignored the old city centres and kept building urbanizations further into the countryside . 
  inwards in portugal . 
  it did n't have to be as pronounced as poland or germany , but even in an extremely homogeneous country like portugal [ political preferences correlate with geography ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gaukvjl.png ) . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/3qk9yh/resultados_das_legislativas_2015_por_concelhos_s%c3%b3/cwg6i1j ), 
  if by the part closer to russia you mean all of poland , than yes . 
  interesting how there does n't seem to exist any correlation between geography and political preferences . 
  except maybe for the purple dps , but even they are a bit all over the place . 
  you support benfica and porto ? 
  would she have been treated differently if she had another ideology ? 
  or is this law specifically protecting islamists ? 
  well , put yourself in be or pcp 's shoes . 
  would you rather have a ps government or a psd + cds government ? 
  be and pcp know that they do n't have the political strength to pass their most extremist ideas , but they would probably support the more idealogical akin ps in exchange of support for their most moderate ideas , do n't you think ? 
   to force you to return we were never part of spain . 
   nothing special happened here , everything was solved accordingly to the constitution and the votes of the people . 
  has anything been solved yet ? 
  last i heard we 'll have a government that is probably not going to last more than a week . 
  and after it falls who knows what will happen . 
   most of the people here were mad with what the leftists were doing , misusing their votes , not the decision of the president . 
  they were ? 
  are there any polls on the subject ? 
  they could have used the [ cplp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/community_of_portuguese_language_countries ) flag for portuguese , but since they are teaching brazilian portuguese specifically i think it 's better they used brazil 's . 
  you did n't hear tu/v \u00f3s in lisbon you heard tu/voc \u00eas , that 's the most common version here , only in inner central and northern portugal will you hear tu/v \u00f3s . 
  i would rather they called it brazilian . 
  the first and only time i tried to use duolingo as a portuguese native speaker , it corrected a perfectly valid sentence i wrote in portuguese just because i used phrasing that would never be used by a brazilian . 
  fu duo , i know portuguese better than you , who are you to tell me that sentence is wrong ?!, 
  since then i 've been a ` native ' english speaker there . 
   i have a different theory , namely that radical shift 's in the social and political sphere 's retard a nation 's prosperity . 
  which radical shifts are we talking about now ? 
  [ this ] ( http://guiastecnicos.turismodeportugal.pt/img/museus/47_palacio_nacional_de_mafra/l/palacio_mafra2.jpg ) is how we spent that brazilian gold . 
  i 'm not a native english speaker . 
  then what should i call the inhabitants of the american continent ? 
  in general . 
  it 's probably an american flaw in general , not just in the us . 
  it 's probably the americans fault , not only you . 
  do you have any data to support that ?

  going straight up against the trend just for the sake of it , with a sense of superiority even the problem with that is if you go ahead and do it , and the others are not in synch you will look very bad . 
  it takes far more courage to be individual , honest . 
  it \u00b4 s a much bigger risk , with a high chance of failing . 
   considering what he said at the end basically calling every other song there commercial crap and that his quality music won against all odds . 
  you see when it won the portuguese festival and the right to represent portugal at eurovision , it was heavily criticized , a lot of people thought we should have sent some crap in english with fireworkds like other countries - even if it \u00b4 s something we are not good at , because we can \u00b4 t quite take seriously . 
   my main problem with it is that it pretty much sounds like a soundtrack for a romance movie or something like that how horrible . 
  it remind me a bit of somewhere over the rainbow , or a hero song from a disney musical . 
  isn \u00b4 t it dreadful ? 
  a song from a romance movie , what a perfectly horrible thing to put on eurovision  but not a show stopper meant to dazzle and showcase your culture . 
  oh , so you know much about portuguese culture to think this is not representing truly portuguese culture ? 
  because in fact , portuguese culture has a very strong , 800 years old and counting tradition of love songs and poems about broken love affairs . 
  the line `` meu bem , ouve as minhas preces '' made me think of cam\u00f5es and bossa nova at the same time ( which of course was in itself derived also partially from portuguese literary tradition ) . 
  in fact the whole rhyme of it is literary . 
  and according to you this does not represent portugal while according to you yodeling romanians singing in english does represent romania . 
  or the sax guy represents moldovan culture . 
  amazing logic . 
   i get what you 're saying yet i 'm really multi cultural and open minded myself , i grew up in romania , taught myself english by 10 and afterwards pretty much grew up on the american part of the internet and their culture , i 'm well travelled around europe , and am currently living in the uk . 
  there are far more cultures in europe than romania , uk and the american part of the internet . 
   i care more about why i could n't predict it . 
  you say you are 22 . 
  that is pretty young , and your definition of multicultural is maybe not as far reaching as you think it is . 
  maybe you don \u00b4 t know how much as you think you know . 
  with time you are going to see lots of things go in and out of fashion , to see fashions and trends swing . 
  when something goes so far in one direction that sometimes you can no longer stand it . 
  what for you seems expected or fun for others might seem fake or tacky . 
  people can react very strongly to the concept of tacky . 
  if you understood portuguese , there was a great link of a portuguese humorist narrating the semifinal and all the places in singer \u00b4 s bodies from which firewords or doves were emerging . 
  it \u00b4 s not everybody \u00b4 s cup of tea . 
   first of all i know tastes are really subjective you could have stopped here . 
  in the last couple of weeks , there have been some posts from weather reports from several parts of europe , i remember the wtf music dance , some others very plastic-ey examples , and then an adorable `` normal-ish '' finnish guy . 
  the really plastic-ey over the top weather reportsm were surprising to me and not in an attractive way , it looked so fake . . and all these have to do with cultural differences , in portugal ( and finland also ) we are a lot more matter-of-factedly with weather reports ( when we had them ) and wanted `` seriousness '' , reliability rather than to be entertained . 
  and maybe deeper cultural differences as well but that is another matter . 
  there is not one european culture . 
  it \u00b4 s pretty diverse and maybe you should be open that yeah , people will like ( respect , or think something is tacky or bad ) different things than you do . 
  you can \u00b4 t say that a song which one the popular vote is `` wrong '' for what the festival was supposed to be about , because the majority defines what they actually really really want . 
  i checked , and it + s got typos ( ling\u00edsticos , a disposi\u00e7\u00e3o ) and grammar ( haja visto que , a tem\u00e1tica do projeto ) . 
  really odd comma positioning . 
  they actually deign to accept people whose nationality is mainly portuguese ( not solely , not uniquely . 
  mainly . 
  i bet it \u00b4 s for visa requirements ) . 
  they absolutely should have hired somebody who could write portuguese !, 
  maybe they should have tried paying them . 
  the ads are online and they copy-pasted all ads http://emprego.sapo.pt/emprego/empresa/28317/empresa.htm for humorists , actress , medical sex experts , journalists , fashion expert , etc and all reads the same for all positions . 
  they have edited it out a bit since the scandal but mentioned sexual desinibition as a requirement . 
  http://emprego.sapo.pt/emprego/anuncio/4084515/especialista-em-moda - ( mf ) . htm schedule is according the employee \u00b4 s choice . 
  payment is `` adjustable according to willingness and abilities shown by the candidate '' . 
  it reads like a recruitment for prostitutes . 
  ( brazillian prostitutes are kind of a brand category for prostitutes in portugal ) . 
  i would most certainly not call them a portuguese company , the guy who is the owner is a brazillian , called heinrich pereira , who has been convicted in brazil for selling abortion pills over the internet . 
  if i were a terrorist , wanting to bring down a plane , i would say fly from dakar or mexico city . 
  places where anyway i would expect there to be a lot less control of everything than in europe . 
  you could also merge it with the emcdda drug agency in lisbon . 
  cheaper that way , and will reduce the number of agencies . 
  40 agencies is a lot !, 
  there is no fucking way the eu will accept to impose ground control passenger restrictions on its own airlines and exempt airlines from the country imposing the restrictions - it will not enforce something which is discriminating its own airlines . 
  and at this moment in time , there is not much trust in current american institutions to be unbiased and objective , instead of trying to gain business advantage using security made up fears . 
  it will be interesting to watch what happens , but there is no fucking way the eu will let eu airliners be disadvantaged regards to american companies . 
  if it is like the middle east ban , us airlines will be exempt . 
  which stinks of protectionism under disguise . 
  americans can impose those rules sure , it will be awesome for their east coast industry . 
  but the eu might also impose the very same rules or others to flights originating from the usa . 
  i like that , probably because that is what i am used to also . 
  or kind of , we no longer do weather forecasts with people , and it used to be real live meteorologists from the official institute anyway . 
  the official predictions on the internet or in graphic form are extremely reliable though so i am not criticizing the choice of priorities !, 
  lol will check that when i can . 
  but a regular looking person rather than a barbie or ken doll which is what a lot of countries go for and looks so weird to me, 
  that is adorable . 
  and sympathies . 
  and i like how normal your weather guy is . 
  no specific word . 
  just full/new moon tide . 
  the september/october ones are more dangerous to people - sea is warmer so more thermal currents , sea and air are warmer so more people in the beaches . 
  the bathing , lifeguard season extends to october 1st . 
  tides are not about waves , it \u00b4 s about the pull of moon . 
  you can have very strong tides even when waves are mild . 
  but i get what you are getting at , just pointing out from my point of view west and east makes a lot more sense than atlantic coast since it all seems the atlantic to me !, 
  living tides is the literal translation of the portuguese word , i think there is no exact equivalent in english . 
  wikipedia says spring tides are , regardless of season , the full/new moon tides . 
  the living tides are , in portuguese , the spring tides closest to the equinox , which are much higher and lower , very surprising sometimes particularly if there is weather associated , and very dangerous . 
  they are equinocial spring tides , and only those ones , not the ones at the rest of the year . 
  it \u00b4 s still the atlantic you know ... 
  the east part is the atlantic also , right ? 
  do you have a special name for it ? 
  and autumn . 
  equinoxes . 
  but it depends on the phase of the moon . 
  the important thing is for your boys in blue to stay on that side of the atlantic . 
  please . 
  depends on the coast it seems . 
  some parts of france , even atlantic mainland parts are pretty similar , the mediterranean obviously lol , but normandy and brittany i know have a lot of variance . 
  east coast of ireland i also think it \u00b4 s pretty mild . 
  we have those here as well . 
  weirdly , because freak waves are freak they can show up even in relatively calm days and sometimes even in the summer ( towards the end of august , when the sea is warmer and it \u00b4 s getting close to the equinox ) . 
  and a ** lot ** are foreigners ( and this year , somebody doing a religious service to a brazillian sea divinity in february when there was a big weather red alert and interdition for the sea coast . ), 
  that map is fantastic !, 
  did not know it , thank you . 
  we are in the red area , no idea those were so rare . 
  not sure what the scale is , if it \u00b4 s average amplitude to a average , it \u00b4 s more or less right , on `` normal '' tide amplitudes are 2-3 meters , but from the same place with supermoons and equinoxes and full/new moons the 2-3 meters can double and count on 4-5 meters as the upper limit . 
  edit - our rivers got tides . 
  i have seen rivers flow upriver , up to 20 , 30 km away from the sea .

   yeah , that 's because of the american system , because inmates are kept on death row , with special conditions for decades before they are actually executed it 's part of a system to minimize the number of innocent people who are wrongly executed . 
  if you execute them after a week and a new witness appears two days later ... well , that 's some bad luck for the guy that was just executed . 
   the death penalty be decided exclusively by a jury , not a judge why ? 
  a jury is just a group of ordinary citizens . 
  like all people , they can make a wrong decision , and i think that the average citizen is more likely than a judge to be persuaded by arguments that sound good but are based on shaky evidence . 
   there are many cases where it is beyond doubt who did a horrible crime and they show no remorse for it . 
  the only one i can think of right now is breivik . 
  but it 's really hard to be 100 % sure . 
  if you are 99.9 % sure , or 99.999 % sure , do you still consider it as 100 % ? 
  where is the line drawn ? 
  there is no such thing as 100 % on a court . 
   well , there are many cannibals who only got to eat one person before they were captured , so would not classify as serial killers , yet it 's still a much more horrible crime than a plain murder . 
  ah i can see your point , although i do n't really think it 's that much worse if they ate the person after they were dead . 
  raping/torturing/mutilating someone and then killing them is in my opinion worse than killing a person and eating them afterwards , or at least that 's how i would see it if i was the victim in that case . 
  this one is certainly up to personal opinion . 
   why invest resources into keeping alive a person that clearly does not have and never will have any value for society because you do n't know if this is true . 
  are you able to say with certainty how you will think and act in 10 years ? 
  how about 20 or 50 years ? 
  if you ca n't answer this question about yourself , how can you answer it about someone you barely know ? 
  is there a maximum timeline for when they can rehabilitate themselves ? 
  maybe you think it 's not worth it to support them if it only happens in 50 years from now . 
  what if it takes 10 years , or a year , or two months ? 
   is a constant danger to other inmates and prison officers i do n't like to ask for sources , but do you have anything that shows that people who receive life sentences are more likely to commit violent acts in prison ? 
  i also want to thank you for debating this in such a polite way . 
  sometimes it 's hard to find discussions where people do n't throw insults at each other . 
  edit because i did n't see your point about breivik before replying : in norway it 's possible to keep a person in prison if they are deemed to still be dangerous to society ( which breivik will probably be ) . 
  it seems like a good way to make it work . 
   life imprisonment is expensive killing them is actually more expensive than just keeping them in prison for life . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29552692/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/execute-or-not-question-cost/#.ty45tlxau8a ) although i believe that cost should not be a consideration when we 're trying to decide whether we should kill someone or not . 
   i do think there are some criminals who can not be rehabilitated no one can be 100 % sure of this , just like no one can be 100 % sure if someone is guilty or not . 
  killing one innocent person is one person too much . 
   cannibals i 'm slightly confused here . 
  if you mean a person who kills other people in order to eat them , is n't that the same as a serial killer ? 
  i do n't understand why you made this distinction . 
   also puts other inmates at risk , because those who get life imprisonment know they do n't have anything to lose there are always worse punishments . 
  get thrown into solitary detention , be sent to a `` harsher '' prison , etc. 
   should n't it be enough to pick another dns server that is n't run by a company subject to portuguese law ? 
  yes and that 's what some people do , but there are a lot of people who barely know how to use technology and they 're now in the dark . 
  the speed at which the website blocking is progressing scares me . 
  i 'm not sure how long it was since the first blocked website , but it might have been less than a year . 
  since then they have used it for way too many pirate sites , uber , and now this . 
  how long will it be until they discover we can easily bypass the blocking and work to fix that ? 
  probably immigrants . 
  i doubt they 're considering the babies who ca n't speak yet as part of this study . 
  there are * a lot * of older people who only had 4 years of education ( 6-10 years old ) , and they did n't learn any foreign languages ( just some basic math , grammar , and history ) . 
  with all the immigration and the low natality rates , those people still have a lot of weight in terms of percentage compared to the younger people who can understand and speak english . 
  it 's strange that you ran into that problem in a place that is as used to tourists as algarve , though . 
  ignoring the `` less developed '' part since i know what you mean ... it 's caused by young people emmigrating because they have no jobs in their native country . 
  they move elsewhere and they build families , have kids , etc. 
  elsewhere . 
  that 's why we need to revamp the way our system works . 
  as it is , no country could sustain 50 % of unemployment . 
  we either change the way our society works to make sure everyone lives life with dignity , or we let them starve in the streets and they will riot . 
  this is n't really an immigrant problem . 
  it 's just a bigger problem if we let a lot of immigrants in , but it 's a big enough problem for the amount of peope we already have . 
  considering that wwii was just 70 years ago , i think a majority of people considering war in europe `` impossible '' is a great thing . 
  still , war does n't have to mean troops on the ground and bombing cities . 
  it starts with hatred , and some of the hatred i used to see ( and here in this subreddit too ) directed from certain countries to others , scared me . 
  somehow it seems to be a lot better now than it was a few months ago , maybe that 's a good sign . 
  that 's partially because we know we wo n't get any significant number of immigrants ; they just do n't want to come here . 
   you can buy fixed amount in 95 % of shops do you mean all shops ? 
  or shops that sell cellphones and stuff like that ? 
  we can buy it in some shops , usually the ones that sell euromillions and lottery tickets too , but we pay a fee when doing that ( 50c if i 'm remembering correctly ) . 
  i mean `` direct transfer '' as in those that do n't need your permission every time , like the house bills and stuff like that , you can authorize them to just take the money from your bank account monthly and never worry about paying on time . 
  i never did it directly from my bank 's site , so i 'm not sure how it works there . 
  probably the same as doing it from an atm , i guess . 
  i mean like prepaid phones . 
  you buy a sim card with a certain amount of $ on it , and then when you spend most or all of it , just go to an atm , input your phone number and the amount , and the funds will be taken from your account and to your sim card pretty much instantly . 
  is this method available in other countries too ? 
  if not , how do you guys transfer funds to prepaid phones ? 
  i ca n't think of anything easier , except maybe direct transfer from your bank amount , but those need to be scheduled . 
  we have `` maintenance '' fees just for having a bank account that work just like that though : if you keep a certain amount of money in your account you do n't need to pay them . 
  we usually joke that this is the money we pay for the bank employer to go into the vault and clean the dust from our own personal bills . 
  portugal . 
  i thought it was an europe-wide thing , even though my country is supposed to have one of the best atm networks in the world . 
  the banks here reached an agreement and the atms are the same for every bank , and you can use the machines everywhere without worrying if it 's from your own bank or not . 
  you can do a lot of operations on them too , like paying bills , transferring money to your cellphone , or creating an instant `` virtual '' credit card to use online . 
  you wo n't pay fees when withdrawing money or making transfers to another bank account , for example . 
  [ more details here if you 're interested , since i 'm bad at explaining this . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multibanco ), 
  paying fees at atms when withdrawing your own money . 
  great list , but as a portuguese , i need to disagree with this  30c is too hot to go outside 30c is a pretty standard temperature here . 
  now , 35c + ... that 's starting to get kind of unconfortable . 
  ah i did n't even look at your name , now i see it . 
  :p i figured it was probably somewhere in eastern europe since all the lower prices in this thread are from there . 
  that sounds cheap , which country is it ? 
  abstention is always about 50 % . 
  also the lists are never updated , so it 's fair to say the real abstention is lower than that . 
  if i 'm understanding your idea , it would actually be the other way around : the hour changed so that people have light in the morning , so you would actually change the schedule so they start one hour later . 
  either way , i guess we can both agree that the clock change is a bad idea . 
  edit : typo, 
  no , but if you leave work/school at 5pm , this means that the sunset already happened when you finish your work day , and that 's kind of depressing . 
  the `` portuguese syriza '' is not the communist party , it 's the left bloc ( be ) . 
  they only got about 11 % of the popular vote , while the center-left party ( ps ) got 32 % , so be 's strength in the coalition will be nothing like syriza . 
  til `` silva '' ( portugal 's most common surname ) is actually derived from forest . 
  nowadays it just means `` bramble '' ( the blackberry bush ) . 
  as an example : you can get a small hamburguer ( just the hamburguer ) at mcdonalds for like 1,20 $ here in portugal . 
  it will probably not fill you up because it 's small , but you 'd get far less with 1,20 $ of healthy food . 
  you would too if you had the temperatures we have this week ... 35\u00bac + while standing in the shadow , certainly 40\u00bac + in the sun just based on how much it hurts my skin . 
  :p i do agree on the union , though .

  as with most other european countries , we use the dot and the comma in numbers the reverse way you guys do , but that 's not really punctuation i guess . 
   it 's very weird for me to read stuff written without it , it feels odd . 
  well , the french way feels really odd to me . 
  that and only capitalising the first word in titles , which i think you do as well . 
  and surnames in all caps while we 're at it . 
  sometimes before the first name too , which is also weird to me . 
  i actually created my reddit account specifically to start commenting here . 
  i feel like there used to be way more portuguese music sung in english around the mid 00s or so . 
  back then i guess it was seen as a bit tacky for a rock song , for instance , to have portuguese lyrics . 
  now it 's `` cool '' to sing in portuguese again . 
  i see the armillary sphere ( if that 's what you meant ) as a symbol of the discoveries , not of the colonial empire . 
  not that the discoveries were n't associated to land appropriation and enslavement of natives , but i do think these things can be somewhat separated . 
  not to mention the moorish castles and the shields which i think have something to do with jesus supposedly appearing to d. afonso henriques almost 900 years ago . 
  that barely carries any meaning today , they 're just symbols traditionally associated to our country . 
  i do think there 's an excessive glorification of certain portuguese achievements that still shines through in the narrative through which portuguese history is taught and commonly interpreted by us portuguese people , and , to get back on topic , i think it might be a lasting effect of the estado novo propaganda machine . 
  ( sorry if i 'm getting a bit rambly , i 'm not responding directly to you anymore , just going on about stuff . ), 
  i do n't see how the flag and anthem could be interpreted specifically as symbols of the estado novo , to be honest , especially when the estado novo was born from a coup against the regime that instituted the flag and the national anthem . 
  half a year or so ago , a guy killed a policeman who stopped him over and intended to kill another one but he pretended to be dead and survived . 
  he stole the police car and later shot two more people to steal the car they were in . 
  he was on the run for almost two months and finally turned himself in . 
  he had military training . 
  it was one of the biggest news stories of 2016 , it was on the news every day for that whole period . 
  yeah , the uk has been getting a lot of portuguese immigrants in the last few years , as opposed to countries like france where portuguese communities come mostly from the migration wave in the 60s . 
  i 'm from porto , so yeah , maybe i get worse water than other places . 
  bottled water definitely tastes better , tap water tastes a bit like the chemicals they use to treat it . 
  getting to sweden and having some tap water there for the first time was a rather pleasant surprise to me . 
  and then it kind of varies between different people and whether they find it important to have water that tastes a bit better . 
  restaurants and caf\u00e9s tend to always give you bottled water . 
  and i 'd say portuguese from brazil actually sounds closer to spanish than portuguese from portugal . 
  and yeah , the languages are similar if you see them written , but the pronunciation is quite different . 
  people usually say we sound like russians speaking spanish . 
  you also hear `` drunk spanish '' sometimes but i think that 's mostly towards brazilian portuguese . 
  in porto there 's mostly spanish and french tourists . 
  you see quite a few germans as well . 
  french tourists seem to be mostly families and german tourists mostly young couples , but this is anecdotal . 
  in english speaking countries , the americas are usually considered two separate continents , but what is and is n't usually considered a continent is a bit culture-dependent . 
  in portugal at least , we typically consider 5 continents : europe , asia , africa , america and oceania . 
  sometimes antarctica is included as well . 
  `` north america '' refers only to the geographic area of canada and the us , while the rest of what you call north america + the caribbean is `` central america '' . 
  interestingly , in the media , you sometimes hear `` north american '' meaning `` from the us '' . 
  by the way ,  do n't know if they have anything to do with carnivals though ... `` carnival '' is just what a lot of countries call shrove tuesday . 
  fair enough , i stand corrected , maybe it 's just that i live in a busier urban area . 
  i 'd wait . 
  i think most people here would too . 
  also , i do n't think we have the fancy car detecting lights that some central europeans here are mentioning . 
  yeah , in many european countries , including my own , the main centre left party is called socialist party or a variation thereof . 
  it 's just that some of our countries have a broader concept of `` socialism '' than english speaking countries do . 
  some cities have their own names in portuguese with different spelling : * new york -  nova iorque * new jersey -  nova j\u00e9rsia ( people often just say new jersey tough ) * philadelphia -  filad\u00e9lfia * new orleans -  nova orle\u00e3es * san francisco -  s\u00e3o francisco ( other ` san 's do n't seem to get this treatment ) states : * ny and nj - see above * some of them have extra accents ( e.g. 
  calif\u00f3rnia , fl\u00f3rida ) * north/south/west are translated * pensilv\u00e2nia , havai , novo m\u00e9xico * sometimes you see the spellings alasca and luisiana as for pronunciation alone , a lot of names are just adapted to portuguese pronunciation rules , as are most foreign words ( just like in english ) . 
  i ca n't think of any example right now that actually has a vastly different pronunciation from english . 
  well , so far it 's been a shitshow ... 
  oh , really ? 
  that would be unthinkable in portugal . 
  we always call professors `` professor '' and it would be very weird to use the informal `` you '' with a professor . 
  spain does seem to be more informal than portugal in general , actually . 
  if i remember correctly , in the portuguese version they just stuck with `` tom marvolo riddle '' and kept the anagram in english , and just translated it to portuguese on a footnote or in brackets afterwards . 
  i 've heard some languages ' versions of harry potter even change characters ' names to something native , but for us , we 're just supposed to understand that everything 's happening in an english-speaking world that 's just being translated . 
   in portugal sometimes we say a am\u00e9rica , it 's not uncommon at all to hear it , but it is used less often ( like , about a third or a fourth of the time ) i guess that 's because we also use `` am\u00e9rica '' to mean `` the americas '' , which we tend to consider a single continent and not two . 
  we do use `` americano '' for someone from the us though ( but they do n't say that in brazil , where they say `` estadounidense '' - `` unitedstatan '' , sort of - instead , because they consider themselves americans too , seeing as they 're in the americas ) . 
  the equivalent of usa is eua , but you only ever see it in writing , people do n't actually say it . 
  regionalist parties are actually unconstitutional in portugal . 
  i was actually warned by a policeman once after i crossed on a red light . 
  he seemed to be there on purpose for that effect . 
  he said he should fine me ( i guess this was around 2010 because he quipped that s\u00f3crates wanted my money ) but he 'd just let me go that one time . 
  the portuguese language also had a spelling reform recently ( though it 's still controversial ( as is the german one , as far as i 'm aware ) ) , and i think some european countries have a small spelling reform every once in a while . 
  7 channels . 
  it was only 5 until two months ago , and one of them is the parliament channel . 
  two of these channels are privately-owned . 
  not really sure , to be honest . 
  i 'm not aware of anyone i know who regularly goes to sports matches that are n't football . 
  i do remember there was some ultras drama/controversy a couple of years ago that involved a futsal game , but it was a spillover from football proper . 
  according to wikipedia 's * history of portugal ( 1834-1910 ) * page , `` between 1847 and 1851 nothing politically notable happened : nothing was legislated , there were few conflicts and parliament convened routinely . '', 
  football dominates by far - it 's on the news pretty much every day , even when there were no games that day , and the news channels air football panels daily on prime time . 
  i 'd guess basketball comes next , with older people typically following mostly the national league and younger people paying more attention to american basketball . 
  after that , i 'd say roller hockey ( the one on rollerskates , apparently obscure in most of europe ) , futsal , handball and volleyball . 
  tennis too , but people tend to follow the international events more than the domestic ones . 
  a lot of these sports benefit from the fact that clubs tend to do more than one sport , and the big football clubs are also the main clubs in some of the other sports , and fans get into these other sports as an extension to their support for their football club . 
  in the younger generations , definitely , but i 'd say jos\u00e9 might be more common overall . 
  yeah but people say it as a question , which makes it more like `` am i ? '', 
  or `` am i , yes ? '', 
  which sounds like you 're asking if you yourself are there . 
  also , just to add to the general discussion , to friends we usually say `` tou ? 
  '' , which is an informal shortening of `` estou '' ( we tend to remove the es - from forms of the verb `` estar '' in more colloquial speech ) . 
  is also common with friends . 
  yeah i do n't think i 've ever seen deca-anything since i learned about units in primary school . 
  all our recipes are in grams . 
  we never use deca - or hecto - for any unit in everyday life ( except for the hectare ) , we go straight to kilo - when appropriate . 
  stereotypically , the communist party , as far as i know . 
  there is n't much support overall for the reinstatement of monarchy . 
  we abolished it in a coup in 1910 , so no one actually remembers those times , and portugal 's last years as a kingdom are known to have been chaotic ( though that was also true of its first years as a republic ) . 
  there are monarchists though , and a supposed heir to the portuguese throne who actually is usually referred to with the title `` dom '' , which is what we used for kings and other nobles ( and still do use for bishops ) . 
  there 's a monarchist party , ppm , but they 've had 0.28 % of votes in the last parliamentary elections . 
  there are also quite a few monarchists in the most conservative party in our parliament ( cds-pp , 6.5 % of mps ) , though the party itself does n't pursue the reinstatement of monarchy politically . 
  ppm actually has close institutional relations with cds-pp as well as with the main centre-right party psd ; they occasionally run together at the local level in some municipalities , and the three of them ran as a single party in parliamentary elections for some time in the late 70s/early 80s . 
  the jewish population were forced to convert to christianity by the inquisition , and were expelled otherwise . 
  descendents of the expelled jews can now claim portuguese citizenship . 
  english actually has quite a rigid structure , more so than german , it 's just that the german verb placement rules are n't very intuitive for native speakers of a lot of languages . 
  vocabulary : * those verbs with prepositions attached , like ankommen , umziehen , etc , are hard because you end up having lots of different verbs that look similar , which in my experience makes them hard to retain . 
  * the prepositions that come after verbs , nouns and adjectives ( eg : warten goes with auf ) are also tough to memorise , but these are often quite different across languages and a german learning portuguese would have the same problem . 
  * ( edit  some words that come before adjectives , such as ganz , zwar , ja , eigentlich , etc. , whose exact usage is a bit nuanced and not easy to grasp until you 've heard/seen them used many times in many contexts .

  this sentence shows that a lot of leaders have no pulse and wo n't be able to handle this problem ... 
  maybe its is time to give vehicles , training , ect to the firefighters ... 
  this happened in 2003 and it seems that we have n't learnt anything ... 
  lets explain this : wants eu labor , not midlle east labor . 
  eu , ate least in paper , has a strong influence in the europol system and in creating and maintaining mechanisms that allow tracking of suspected individuals and the ways to deal with them . 
  considering this , a lot of attacks involved individuals that have been previously referred and some of them even went to syria !, 
  so , would you say that the eu is doing its part ? 
  i 'm as equally enlightened as you ... now , lets discuss this . 
  there are two probable scenarios here : the first on is an attack done by some mentally unstable guy , the second one is terrorism . 
  sometimes they are connected and the majority of terrorists have some kind of crazyness in their body . 
  now , put a list of major attacks on civilians in the last 5years . 
  how many were commited by terrorists ( daesh attacks , al-qaeda , etc ) and how many were commited by a single mentally ill person not connected to terrorism ? 
  well , when you imply that an attack having people dead is different from an attack without dead people ... an attack is an attack , it should n't happen !, 
  so , you would say this is a reasonable outcome ? 
  they say there are 4 critically injured people ... 
  yes they count , 
  we will see  anyway , sad for the dead people and their families . 
  a troll because i do n't share your opinion ? 
  very very good text !!, 
  saved it for future reading . 
  2 years ago i was one of the most pro-eu person you could find , but eu has taken catastrophic measures since then and it is ignoring the problems that normal citizens face everyday . 
  economic crisis , poverty , immigration , international policy ... 
  failing in every field of decision . 
  hungary is on the right path and i wish you all the best , 
  so best outcome is the constant islamization of turkey ? 
  the soldiers who made the coup are heroes . 
  probably the status quo will defeat them , but this is just one battle ... 
  ahahah cry me a river !, 
  champions !, 
  to the final we go !!, 
  mr schaaeuble sees himself as the commander of eu ... 
  well , i 'm seing a pattern with the poles ... 
  keep hating and we keep going , 
  not against china . 
  like uk can fight china on this ... 
  who needs life experience on a past reality ? 
  it is very sad that people who will probably never know the effects of their voting , decide the future of an entire generation . 
  not very democratic ... 
  this is getting interesting . 
  while south gets the garbage ... 
  best things in this country : peaceful and low crime rates . 
  pagan festivities have virtually no expression arround here ... 
  shame on us ... 
  so why are n't brexit supporters asking for a change in eu structure that would allow fair representation of countries and allow direct representation of each country interests in eu ? 
  the problem with this line of argumentation is that it looks like you ca n't stand having germany ( f.ex ) as an important piece in eu decisions . 
  if i was a uk citizen i would vote leave for different reasons : - uk has a strong currency and a strong economy - uk has been suffering devastating effects from uncontrolled migration and very bad integration of certain groups . 
  i can only conclude that if you think eu as a trade block is declining , there is absolutely no point in having trade with eu . 
  i have no problem in not trading with the uk ... ( i am pro-brexit ), 
  or , governments are just incompetent and full of corruption ... that has nothing to do with integration . 
  integration does n't solve problems , it just puts a mask on issues ... 
  ofc  its just to somehow discuss this issue with someone who has the same opinion ... 
  why is further integration needed to solve anything ? 
  `` a portuguese spy was arrested in italy on suspicion of being passing information to an officer of the secret service of another country . 
  according to di\u00e1rio de not\u00edcias , the portuguese official of security service ( sis ) , was caught while passing information to a russian spy svr . 
  portuguese police ( pj ) refers only to `` the existence of suspicion of a crime of espionage , by an official on behalf of a foreign intelligence service . '', 
  according to the statement of the pj , `` a complex and sensitive operation , which took place from the end of last week and ended yesterday , following which it was possible to clarify facts regarding the practice of espionage crimes , corruption and violation of secrecy state '' .

  fruit of the relationship between the public prosecutor , the pj and the security information service ( sis ) , and the level of international cooperation with the italian authorities , two people were arrested in rome for alleged practice of espionage crimes , corruption and violation of state secret . 
  the statement suggests that the suspects were caught in the act and that has already begun the extradition process .

  but yeah , haters gon na hate . 
  well , your opinion , nothing more ... 
  people say it is a shit because they fail at it . 
  great winner !!!, 
  my favourite !, 
  good song from polan !, 
  ukraine must win !!!!!, 
  maybe we should leave eu ... we would continue poor but at least we would n't be puppets of certain countries/interests .

  well , wikipedia say that a skyscraper is a highrise with  50m ... 
  i do n't agree tough ... 
  lisboa - parque das na\u00e7\u00f5es ( east lisbon ) on the picture you can see both torre de s\u00e3o gabriel e torre de s\u00e3o rafael with 110m . 
  on the left it is oriente railway station . 
  on the back it is vasco da gama bridge , the longest bridge in europe .

  well , i confused myself skyscraper vs supertall . 
  this is what happens when i do n't go to ssc as often as i would like ... 
  these are probably highrises and not skyscrapers . 
  anyway , good pic , 
  yeah , because not wanting to be a puppet mean to leave eu ... really ? 
  the objective is to be nor russia nor us friendly . 
  that would be just as right if there was no doubt about the responsability of the attack . 
  trusting cia is just not enough ... 
  individual european countries ( france , germany , italy ... ) also supported the attack . 
  no , i am eager to see eu countries to stop dual criteria , and stop supporting acts like this one . 
  aparently is ok for eu for us to decide which countries are legit or not ... 
  it is an act of undeclared war . 
  totally !,

  they stayed at a hostel on iskra street . 
  during the first saturday , 9th of april , some students decided to go out at night . 
  during that night , a man called one of the 18 year old boys `` trash '' , and pulled on his clothes and hair . 
   the teenagers were scared . 
  the professor responsible for the exchange programme , stanislaw augustine , denounced the case to the police . 
  the suspect , identified by the authorities , is a military man , 38-years old , with 11 years of experience in the armed forces having also served in afghanistan . 
   some of the students have darker skin and were confused as being muslim migrants , confirmed the police speaker , adam szelag . 
  the public safety police collected evidence of the verbal offense and violation of the victim 's physical integrity , and submitted the case to the military police . 
   according to the rzeszow news portal , stanislaw augustine said that this was n't the only incident to involve those 15 students . 
  while some were taking a walk around town , they heard insults in english and polish . 
  there were even some people who raised their hands and showed their middle finger . 
  this also happened in buses , stores , and the town 's market plaza . 
   `` as a pole , i 'm ashamed that citizens of other countries are direct targets of racist commentary '' , commented the professor . 
  `` polish students went to portugal and were received warmly , thoughtfully , gently , not to say friendly . 
  portuguese students come here and these things happen . '', 
   the case was reported to the portuguese consulate in poland . 
  the company that organized the trip was also informed . 
  attempts were made by p\u00dablico to contact the consulate , the portuguese secretary of state of the communities jos\u00e9 lu\u00eds carneiro , and the person responsible for the company , but were unable to reach any of them . 
   the possibility was considered for the students to return immediately to portugal . 
  stanislaw augustine found an alternative : he rented a house in the outskirts of town and hired the services of a security company to protect them . 
  `` they fear for their own safety . 
  i had no other choice . 
  i had to change their location . 
  it 's sad , but true '' , he declared to the rzeszow news portal . 
  from the same wikipedia article , `` 3 '' means caged farming . 
   caged : this had a requirement of 550 cm \u00b2 minimum space per hen . 
  however the eu has banned battery cages by 2012 through an update of ec directive 1999/74/ec . 
  ** the new minimum is 750 cm \u00b2 in furnished cages . 
  ** so it 's not that you ca n't buy eggs marked with a 3 . 
  just that the `` 3 '' marking now mean 750 cm \u00b2 in furnished cages ( picture 2 , `` enriched cages '' in the pictures linked ) instead of 550 cm \u00b2 battery cages ( picture 1 ) . 
  and countries with `` bad armies '' would feel disadvantaged , and would never agree to finance such a deal .

  are you sure ? 
  i did n't read much into it , but i assumed that stuff like the `` emergency brake '' on benefits of non-uk nationals ( the treaties do specify that there can be no discrimination of eu nationals regarding work rights ) , or removing the `` ever closer union '' phrasing from the treaties would actually require a treaty change . 
  do you have any source that these do not require treaty changes ? 
  ps : just to make sure , since text usually makes it harder to discern intent - i 'm not calling you a liar . 
  it 's just that i assumed these changes required an actual treaty change ( or at least , had to undergo the typical `` eu law '' ratification process ) , so i 'd be interested in reading an explanation why that 's not the case . 
  i do n't disagree with your opinion that there should be no forced migration quotas , you do not have to try and convince me of that . 
  i am also very critical at most of the eu-level decisions regarding migration over the last few years . 
  all i 'm saying is , the lisbon treaty clearly specifies immigration , including * illegal immigration * ( tfeu art . 
  79 paragraph 2c ) as sole competencies of the eu ( because shengen is also a competency of the eu ) , and that they should be decided using qmv . 
  as much as you do not agree with the decisions taken following these treaty rules , my point is that they are not arbitrary , illegal or against the treaties . 
  they also required a qualified majority of countries in the council to be in favour of them !, 
  now , that said , you could of course campaign for a treaty change , but that 's something else entirely . 
  calling a referendum in a single country because somehow the decisions at the eu-level were undemocratic , is the wrong way forward , as for them to have passed a qualified majority must have agreed with them , and your country also signed a treaty where you agreed to follow qmv decisions on immigration ( even if your country disagreed with any of those decisions ) !, 
  i mean , if you really must call a referendum , the only logical possibility i see would be to ask whether people wish to leave the eu instead ( and as such no longer having to follow any qmv decision at eu-level ) ... 
  anything else is pure demagogy . 
  note : `` you '' here does not refer to you specifically , instead to everyone in this thread who agreed with orban 's referendum . 
  [ article 79 tfeu ] ( https://europadatenbank.iaaeu.de/user/view_legalact.php?id=72 ) ( emphasis mine )  1 . 
  the union shall develop a common immigration policy aimed at ensuring , at all stages , ** the efficient management of migration flows ** , fair treatment of third-country nationals residing legally in member states , and the prevention of , and enhanced measures to combat , illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings . 
  for the purposes of paragraph 1 , ** the european parliament and the council ** , acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure , shall adopt measures in the following areas :  ( a ) ** the conditions of entry and residence ** , and standards on the issue by member states of long-term visas and residence permits , including those for the purpose of family reunification ;  ( b ) the definition of the rights of third-country nationals residing legally in a member state , including the conditions governing freedom of movement and of residence in other member states ;  ( c ) ** illegal immigration and unauthorised residence ** , including removal and repatriation of persons residing without authorisation ;  ( d ) combating trafficking in persons , in particular women and children it * can * be joint with national governments or not . 
  in this case , it 's clearly not . 
  it is true that ( according to the same tfeu article 79 paragraph 5 ) member states have the right to determine volumes of admission of third-country nationals ( eu can not impose immigration quotas per se ) , but under the current `` forced '' migration quotas orban is so against , a country may decline to participate , and instead pay into the system ( `` ensuring , at all stages , the efficient management of migration flows '' , which is a competency solely of the eu ) , which means , technically , a member state can still decide not to have migration quotas `` forced '' on it . 
  but the thing is , it 's not arbitrary . 
  [ the lisbon treaty lists * all * issues that the eu has competency in , and which ones of those require unanimity . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voting_in_the_council_of_the_european_union#policy_areas ) in this specific case , `` immigration '' is an issue that , as of lisbon , is voted using qmv ( article 79 tfeu ), 
   a german lapdog donald deliberatelly made it a majority based vote and stripped member states from their veto rights . 
  the lisbon treaty , which all eu countries ratified , allows certain issues ( including migration/borders ) to be voted under qmv . 
  so , on these issues , member states * do not have * individual veto rights . 
  a blocking minority is required to actually block a decision , which in the migration quota case the opposing countries did not manage to assemble . 
  you may disagree with that , and i understand your point of view regarding the `` undemocratic council '' ( although i am pro-federalization , i want the legislative power to be based around the euparl instead of the council for similar reasons ) but your parliament * did * agree to these rules when they ratified lisbon , giving up any and all veto rights on specific issues . 
  it 's ridiculous to say that qmv in the council is `` illegal '' or that someone decided to strip member states from their veto rights `` just because '' . 
  ps : i also disagree with migrant quotas . 
   btw , in the rio grande do sul brazilians also say `` tu '' , god knows why . 
  god knows why the rest of you guys say `` voc\u00ea '' instead :p but yeah , differences between european and brazillian portuguese are always interesting/funny . 
  one time , i was talking with a brazillian friend who was n't used to european portuguese , and we were talking about some girl and said she was a `` rapariga bonita '' ( `` beautiful girl '' ; `` rapariga '' meaning `` girl '' ) somewhere mid-sentence . 
  our friend is really shocked , why are we insulting that girl ? 
  turns out , `` rapariga '' has a slightly different meaning in brazillian - `` whore '' . 
  no , the `` vos '' form is so old fashioned , it 'd be like if you were speaking with the king 100 years ago or something . 
  most natives ca n't even conjugate the `` vos '' form of many verbs , because nobody uses it . 
  we actually can use `` voc\u00ea '' ( + `` ele '' form of verbs ) as a formal way of speech ( `` voc\u00ea podia fazer-me um favor ? '', 
  = formal `` could you do me a favor ? 
  '' ) , but we usually say `` o senhor '' ( `` sir '' ) instead , or ommit it entirely ( `` o senhor podia fazer-me um favor ? '', 
  as far as i know , in brazillian portuguese `` voc\u00ea '' is an informal form of speech ( equivalent to the `` tu '' form ) , so it 's very different . 
  [ there wo n't be a second round , sorry . 
  well , you might have a chance to vote soon , depending on how the current government holds up , so do n't be too sad , 
   60-days law could you explain that ? 
  i have no idea what this law is . 
  that is n't the complete picture , though ( it 's not supposed to be just `` extra taxes '' ) :  the new arrangements will enable the eurozone to create its own fiscal capacity . 
  revenue will be raised from new ` genuine ' own resources , the subject currently being explored by a high level interinstitutional group under the leadership of mario monti . 
  a eurozone budget of roughly the same size as the current eu budget ( about 1 % gdp ) would give the commission over time the capacity to intervene meaningfully to support contra-cyclical adjustments , for instance through the instrument of a common unemployment insurance scheme . 
  the budget would also be used for investment in large-scale european public goods with real european added value , for example in the field of r&d , energy infrastructure or security measures . 
  the transfer upwards of such expenditure items from national to eu budgets as well as , on the revenue side , the replacement of direct gni contributions by genuine own resources will serve to save national treasuries money . 
   as is the case with the us , the larger the federal budget at its disposal , the less intrusive would the commission need to be in the realm of domestic budgets . 
  with the extra leverage the commission would gain as a result of its new fiscal capacity , the common economic policy should focus on structural reform and the stabilisation of public finance , leaving the national authorities , coordinated in the eurogroup , room for adjustment at state and regional level . 
   the scope of article 136 has to be widened from the narrow demands of fiscal discipline to embrace the possible development of a common economic policy . 
  the introduction of a federal fiscal policy requires the eu to gain powers , at least as far as the eurozone is concerned , for the harmonisation of the structure of taxes and even for the setting of certain tax rates . 
  the prohibitions applying to the eu as a whole in taxation matters will be lifted for the eurozone . 
  as a complement to the new fiscal capacity , we also suggest that much greater salience is given in the economic policy mix at eu level to employment policy . 
  the prohibition on the harmonisation of national employment law should be disapplied for the eurozone . 
   so with an enriched policy mix and provided with meaningful fiscal policy instruments , the commission should be able to provide a clear macro-economic framework within which the policy actors can work at the national and subnational levels . 
  no doubt to the relief of the european central bank , the acquisition by the commission of powerful fiscal policy tools will reduce the political pressure on monetary policy-making , allowing mario draghi to return to more orthodox central banking . 
  the mandate of the ecb will have to be adjusted so that it is charged to support , through its monetary policy , the objectives of the common economic policy , including full employment . 
  but yes , it 's probably the `` least likely '' part of the whole proposal . 
  read the page , it contains the abstract :  at a time when the eu finds itself in a perfect storm of crises which it seems unable to overcome , a bold move is needed to reinvigorate the eu 's system of government and stave off the risk of disintegration . 
  in order to address the inherent weakness of the eu 's monetary and economic governance , this pamphlet proposes a new treaty for the eurozone : the protocol of frankfurt . 
  written by andrew duff , former member of the european parliament and visiting fellow at the epc , it is the first ever attempt to draft a treaty aimed at setting up a fiscal union . 
  `` the protocol of frankfurt provides the constitutional framework for a proper economic government and will , hopefully , also serve to accelerate the debate on the five presidents ' report '' . 
  realising that the time is not ripe for a major constitutional overhaul , the pamphlet instead puts forward a shorter treaty revision that concentrates on re-engineering the maastricht arrangements for the economic and monetary union , taking on the form of a protocol to be added on to the existing treaties . 
  article 48 ( 2 ) of the treaty on european union allows the government of any member state , the european parliament or the commission to table amendments to the treaties .

i was not exacting referring to the dead count ( though you do have a point ) but to the whole climate of political and social tension ... 
  i think any other term fails to describe the current situation, 
  this obviously can not be a short term plan . 
  if it ever happens , i guess it would take decades to gradually come into being, 
  they have a rather large internal market , i think they do n't see the need to `` export '' their music or invest in international promotion, 
   much of its population believes that they should join the european union , and not stay as an independent country . 
  joining the eu does not imply loss of sovereignty ( at least not at the moment ) . 
  while it imposes some limitations , each country is still independent , and free to leav at any moment . 
  tbh to be born into a wealthy family is to be born into a privileged family . 
  and in the end , those with enough power ( in a monarchy or a republic ) end up being above the law . 
  ( and i 'm not a monarchist , but i believe it has certain advantages over traditional republics ), 
  it 's just that middle names are so common in portugal that it 's very strange for someone to have just 1 given name and 1 surname ... 
  i for one have 5 in total, 
  unrelated question : are middle names that uncommon in central europe ? 
   to get danish citizenship do they tell you to gtfo if you do n't have danish citizenship ? 
  supposed unconstitutionality of some of the austerity measures on the next year 's state budget , and whether or not the constitutional court will invalidate some of them ; teachers protest about a evaluation exam that allows them to teach ;, 
  a common timezone in portugal and finland ? 
  that would n't work . 
  you both clearly missed how awesome october was !, 
   they think they have the most beautiful language in the world  they do n't . 
  but they managed to convince others that they do . 
  not me they have n't . 
  i hate the way french sounds . 
  not really suprising , we pratically invented emmigration . 
  it seems that portuguese are in danger of extintion, 
  funny how it is the same with portuguese - brazilians never use the informal `` tu '', 
  the eagle can also apply to the us government, 
  this is serious . 
  that was my point . 
  we have a missing blonde girl and a blonde girl without parents . 
  i say , give the mccann couple this one and end the whole soap opera that the case has become . 
  you can in portugal , every place that 's not lisbon , porto and the algarve, 
  portugal 2 , as i heard someone calling them . 
  they 're doing better than us though . 
  that never happens when there is something at stake . 
  just look at last playoffs . 
  doing things the portuguese way is just that . 
  i think that while they do n't have a minimum wage specifically imposed by the law , they have some kind of mutual agreement with worker syndicates/unions that implies a lower wage limit , iirc, 
  apparently they made a pledge to win it in 2022 . 
  you know , all that heat in qatar will push the odds in their favour xd, 
  and it started raining, 
  love porto , but in braga you can get cheaper rents , and the food costs are also lower ( 3 ~ 4 $ for a decent sized meal ) , 
  amazing team in euro 2004 , joined the grief after the greek tragedy . 
  exceptionally good beer . 
  prague is highly placed on my favourite places to visit . 
  til there are gmt + / - * .5 timezones, 
  as ryanair is now establishing itself at portela airport , probably lisbon can apper a little higher on the list . . 
  i think that would be an overstatement, 
  til this, 
  one of the few portuguese that went to germany . 
  best months of my life so far , 
  in portugal you just need to show up on the day , take a ticket , wait in line for your turn , and then they take to a fancy room ready for those occasions , and you just have to fill all the paperwork  ( that 's how it went with my sister at least ), 
  all types of it, 
  pizza, 
  apparently i 'd start living by the sea . 
  bring it on !, 
  are n't the current us a mix of old british , french and spanish colonies ? 
  why not both \\ o / ? 
  but i 'd rather take a francesinha !, 
  that was not our independence `` process '' . 
  it was the restoration of our independence at best - and we came under spanish rule mostly due to a succession crisis and some very disputable choices and passiveness of our royal pretenders . 
  portugal was already a sovereign nation for 400 years when all of that happened . 
  regarding catalonia , i just do n't see what could possibly compel madrid to grant you independence - the will of the people , even if you get the referendum , and however romantic it might sound , is hardly at the top of the central government 's priorities . 
  i have nothing against either catalonia or the basque country , but i honestly think it will never happen . 
  they might be able to get some kind of extended autonomy from the central government , but i do n't believe spain ( as in the rest of the country ) will let them go . 
  ( but i fully support pro-independence movements , it should be their decision ), 
   they 're better , more exceptional because they 're american . 
  that has been their unnofficial motto for most of the last century , no surprise there . 
  obviously obama `` change of mind '' came from russia 's involvement . 
  russia partially siding with syria on the matter put things into a different perspective , and he realized that he was better off not creating unnecessary friction with russia . 
  and , as putin states ( however hypocritical he might be ) , the un exists for such situations , and to walk over un take action would set a very dangerous precedent . 
  if they want , sure . 
  but it wo n't happen . 
  how is a separatist pro-independence movement not emphasizing on creating borders ? 
  now the only thing left is asking for likes on facebook , an they are on their way to become independent . 
  us trying to do their `` spread democracy '' thing without un formal consent , russia trying to provoke us . 
  that 's pretty much how i see it . 
   not recommended in a friendly setting because the rest are ok xd, 
  it does make it all sound like an octave lower , making it way more difficult to understand for foreigners . 
  yup cod, 
  it was what they wanted after all , the whole reason colonial wars were being fought . 
  so they ca n't really complain of `` being dumped '' , even though that stagnated their development for some time . 
  you can just be proud of what your country is today , and i think it 's totally normal germans to feel that way . 
  as you say , there is a lot of skeletons in everyone 's closet , but the inverse logic still applies - you can find something to be proud of in every country 's history . 
  well , spain wo n't at least xd, 
  i think you may be reading too much into it . 
  whatever history or tradition `` germany '' has , today it 's a country , a sovereign entity defined by its borders , culture and identity . 
  to be a german you just have to be born in germany , or be descendant from germans . 
  it does n't have to be anything exclusive or elitist . 
  to me , someone who fortunately is young enough to have escaped so many of last century 's tragic events , someone saying that is `` proud to be german '' is the same as me saying i 'm `` proud to be portuguese '' . 
  i might be speaking from the outside here , but i lived in germany for some time and i think to the current generation of germans the traditional notion of `` being german '' is not present . 
  you may be right about the whole `` distraction '' thing , but i do n't think portuguese or spanish people even take this issue seriously ... 
  it can support human life , people have lived there . 
  they are just deserted because , well , nothing interesting happens there ... 
  portuguese rocks nonetheless . 
  it 's not really preference , it 's a treaty old as fuck ... 
  i 'd rather hang out with spanish than with british , they are no fun , but what can you do ... 
  so the whole debacle is about interpreting the meaning of `` rocks '' . 
  classic portuguese reaction, 
  tbh , beja airport might be a stupid mistake - ridiculous decision to build an airport on one of the least populated areas of the country .

  he also did stuff like the `` magalh\u00e3es '' and what , in my opinion , makes him clearly the worse , he bought the 2009 election by raising the wages of public workers , an act later replicated by fellow socialist ant\u00f3nio costa in the c\u00e2mara municipal de lisboa . 
  and i have n't even talked about the many scandals of corruption he or close friends/family were involved in . 
  so yeah definitely the worst . 
  has my english failed me ? 
  i 'm not a native speaker but you do n't seem to be answering to what i meant to say . 
  [ edit ] do notice that the article of this submission talks mostly about target2 and germany and really has nothing to do with the uk . 
  what the fuck , does the uk have to do with what was written in that article ? 
  seriously , i 'm pretty much an europhile and think the uk has been wrong in many occasions , but , i 'm getting pretty sick of these constant cheap shots at them which are promptly answered with stupid europhobe articles from the telegraph or something . 
  this subreddit is becoming very very annoying . 
  yeah i noticed that one too . 
  it seemed like the author decided to use the deadly sins theme before knowing exactly what he wanted to say , so he made up that one to get 7 . 
  the others seem reasonably on the mark , although , most of these are stuff every country does , or tries to , and these are like examples of states that got really good at it . 
  where 's part 2 ? 
  i was enjoying this list . 
  [ edit ] nvm [ found it ] ( http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/1294161-europe-s-seven-deadly-sins-22 ), 
  ahahahahhahah sesame street needs this , she can be the new bogeyman or something . 
  yeah that 's why i asked you , since you 're serb there was a chance you either knew or could find something . 
  i would n't say that following orders or defending your country is an excuse for civilian massacres though . 
  was he responsible ( partially ? ), 
  for civilian massacres or not ? 
  it 's kinda the only point that matters i think . 
  i 'm all for paying for the shit we did , i was n't whining about that - at all - however , when they put us in a situation where we will never be able to pay our debts because the ecb keeps running the way they want instead of how at least 5 countries want . 
  that is debt slavery . 
  if they wanted us to pay them back ( which we actually want and are trying hard to do ) they would go a very different route , you do n't need to be a genius to know what deflation does to economies . 
  i 'm more concerned at what they are doing to us right now . 
  first they spread the narrative that we are lazy and profligate ( which the piigs acronym you use helps btw ) and then they force us to solve our problems trough deflation during a fucking world economic crisis . 
  any serious economist can tell you that what they are doing to us is going to cost us very dearly in gdp terms , it will take us decades to recover and we will probably have to default in some our debt this way ( as its percentage to gdp grows ) . 
  the alternative which would be a little ecb driven inflation for europe is not even considered because the germans got fed both the previous narrative and the stupid analogy to weimar republic and the german masses , like all the others , are stupid as shit and like to be told they 're better than the rest . 
  if i was a conspiracy theorist i 'd say they used propaganda very well , to make us debt slaves and rule the eu using the punishments in the recent treaties to take our vote rights away forever . 
  a what ?? 
  for the benefit of those not getting the reference [ the moon is a harsh mistress ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_moon_is_a_harsh_mistress ) . 
  it 's a pretty good book btw . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/360434/god-bless-you-captain-hindsight ), 
  `` elect '' ? 
  lol . 
  democracy does n't really work in places with such a huge percentage of the population directly dependent on the state , all it takes to buy an election is to raise pensions , unemployment benefits and/or public workers wages in election year . 
  certainly almost everyone in europe has noticed at least the first symptoms of this problem as a very big public sector is not exclusively a greek problem ( although they certainly refined it ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure the other greeks , not dependent on the state , were busy either helplessly gnawing their teeth at what was happening to their country or evading taxes so they would not feed this horrible state beast anymore . 
  if you 're worried you should n't be fleeing just from greece , you should be running from the euro and europe altogether . 
  if there 's anything this crisis has shown is that you can count on 1 . 
  european politicians incompetence 2 . the utter lack of power of europe institutions and 3 . 
  which together make europe a very risky place to have your money right now . 
  this not happening is what makes me think that maybe the conspiracy theorists are not paranoid and maybe they really are out to get us . 
  the market has already decided eurobonds will not be enough , why else is everyone getting rating downgrades , the ecb needs to ease . 
  i do agree with the above posters that controls need to be in place , i just do n't understand what the fuck is taking so long , march ?!?!? 
  for fucks sake . 
  if only europe had an institution with the firepower to end this bullshit speculation ... bah not even sarcasm gets me happy ... 
  i do n't see what 's wrong , she 's not a psychopath , is n't that a good thing ? 
  not that surprising , botswana is pretty awesome . 
  of course it does , like the article says 40 % of their exports go to eurozone countries and the figure for eu countries is even higher . 
  emerging markets are not big enough and do not grow fast enough to absorb that . 
  furthermore many of them have complications like tariffs . 
  this is actually a pretty admirable speech , i do n't know how well liked this guy is but in this instance at least , when europe clearly lacks brave politicians and when nationalist rhetoric is on the rise , poles should be proud . 
  you ** can ** borrow your way out of debt . 
  countries need to do a rollover of existing bonds as they expire to pay them , if the market forces them to do that with horrible interest rates you get into a vicious circle . 
  the * bailouts * in europe supposedly allow the countries some time with lower than market interest rates to fix their finances in a way that they can then become sustainable , i do n't see what 's so hard to understand . 
  basically it 's like asking a low interest loan from your bank so you can pay the credit card which has a huge interest rate and later you pay the bank because your salary is enough to pay their monthly payments when , for the credit card , it was n't . 
  iceland is a very poor example as they effectively ** stole ** many europeans by not giving them the same guarantees they gave to icelanders and had committed themselves to also giving to foreign depositors . 
  iceland is , in my opinion , a rogue nation until they decide to pay what they owe to eu citizens . 
  abolishing the euro would be absolutely ruinous for everybody , not just the bankers . 
  as it happens , the bankers have a lot more means of protecting themselves in such an event , than the little guys and small businesses , so it would n't be as ruinous for them . 
  apparently you have a lot of references so it 's not like you do n't want to be informed , perhaps you are suffering from [ confirmation bias ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confirmation_bias ) and should try to broaden your views . 
  they die in jail ? 
  an eu treaty is impossible in a short timeframe as it requires all 27 members to agree ( besides you have the uk there :p ) . 
  it 's about damn time in my opinion , i do n't know why we have been delaying this for so long , letting the crisis get worse and worse and spread to country after country . 
  i would also happily welcome an european level fiscal control on my country finances which , and i agree with the germans on this , should go hand in hand with any ecb unleashing . 
  sure you can , my backyard is not very big but one or 3 barrels will be ok , i will use them to heat my bath water . 
  and another feedback loop begins ... 
  people rarely try to be biased . 
  when you say the general consensus is that our `` bailout was completely uncalled for and unecessary '' you 're clearly being biased in your interpretation of what the consensus is ( maybe it is among your group of friends or family ) , as the facts do not agree with what you say . 
  in fact it does n't matter if it was the markets that fucked us up ( which i do n't think is what happened although the markets certainly took advantage of our fragility ) , without a lender of last resort we needed the bailout or we would n't have any money right now . 
   and if general consensus in portugal really is that the bailout is unnecessary it ** is n't ** . 
  dudewhatthehellman seems to have a very biased opinion , the general consensus was made pretty clear in the last election , where 80 % of voters gave their vote to parties which agreed to the terms of the troika , including the reforms it implied and the bailout . 
  in fact , the parties in our government pretty much said , during the campaign , they would do anything possible to make sure portugal adheres and is successful in accomplishing the goals we have agreed with the troika , and they did get elected . 
  personally , i just see merkel and the germans as being stuborn and applying stupid historic analogies when it comes to letting the ecb help solve the euro crisis as i feel the ecb could actually help europe a lot . 
  not sure how many portuguese actually agree with me on this . 
  maybe , the huge trade imbalance would have never happened without the euro as we would simply be unable to afford so many german cars and other expensive imported stuff . 
  on the other hand it was good for most people , while it lasted , because we ** could ** afford the stuff . 
  we would also be able to try to remain competitive by lowering our coin . 
  however , joining the euro also had some very good consequences like , we finally started being a lot less corrupt and we actually made a serious try at making the transition to higher wage jobs industries instead of being a low wage manufacturer like china . 
  this crisis has really just hit us in a very bad time where we had n't finished none of our goals yet and were seriously unprepared in financial terms . 
  the root cause is complicated , firstly in 1995 our balance of payments was * balanced * but it has ever since and specially since we entered the euro gone seriously negative ( huge trade imbalances ) , secondly our governments , specially the last one , have continuously spent more than they were raking in and thirdly we have a competitiveness problem where we can no longer compete with places like china in the traditional industries and have n't yet completely made the transition to be able to compete with the other places in the more developed ones . 
  there are probably a lot more little reasons i 'm forgetting , in portugal , you do n't really have a big reason like a huge banking crisis ( ireland ) or a huge tax evasion/corruption like greece , that you can point out and say `` there 's the culprit '' although , of course , we had our share of a lot smaller versions of both these reasons that you can add to the above list . 
  we are implementing very hard austerity measures ( more than the troika asked ) so , naturally , our economy will contract . 
  this will obviously damage our debt to gdp ratio but we do n't really have an alternative . 
  this does n't matter much . 
  we had already been declared junk by the other rating agencies . 
  fitch just arrived late to the party and the journalists decided to do the exact same news cycle they already did . 
  greece is quite an extreme case where the cure seems to be , in my opinion , killing the patient . 
  the incentives to perform well are there when you can see a future where , if you make sacrifices now , then you will be well . 
  the greeks probably think they are fubar anyway so fuck it . 
  no what they 're asking for is for europe to avoid economic collapse . 
  you can control the * profligacy * by using the article suggestion of '' making sure that its support was at a sufficiently punitive interest rate '' and by taking the stability and growth pact seriously . 
  what about the scottish !, 
  if you 're in the mood to satisfy my curiosity . 
  why do n't you feel close to slovenians too ? 
  i do n't really see how the euro and the ecb , as they are designed right now could have protected us from the crisis . 
  in fact the euro pretty much creates a situation like china and the us where the trade imbalances grow because the chinese do n't let their coin appreciate vs the dollar . 
  the convergence criteria was bullshitted by almost all the nations , not just greece , although they were clearly the worse offenders and germany was the first to disrespect the budget deficit establishing a precedent . 
  goldman did n't default btw .

  what i mean by this is not paying bills to some providers creating debt that does n't count to that year 's deficit . 
  unfortunately it 's something that happens here and is happening here with the new government . 
  that 's why we had so many problems after getting bailed out , there were so many hidden debts that was ridiculous . 
  i did not said that ... 
  that has nothing to do with what we are discussing . 
  who would win with a default ? 
  no one , specially not people and banks from germany and france ( for the most part ) . 
  saying that loaning at 5 % when you get it lower and is in your interest that the other country comes out of the hole he is , is charity for me is demagogy . 
  see , i 'm not even complaining . 
  just stated that there were no transfer of wealth or any kind of charity because those loans were payed with high interest . 
  i just do n't consider lending with high interest charity , that 's all . 
  charity would be lending with something like 1 % or no interest at all and not 5 % . 
  no it is n't because countries had interest in , for example portugal , not defaulting . 
  if portugal defaulted yeah we would be fucked but so it would be eurozone . 
  people always use the same seed when they random that 's why it 's always lisbon and porto . 
  i want nothing , you called transfer of wealth and i stated the truth . 
  i 'm sorry if i do n't consider a loan with high interest some kind of charity . 
  sorry but money was lent with pretty high interest for something called a transfer of wealth . 
  euro bonds are n't only for greece . 
   well a good chunk of countries have simply not tried . 
  what do you really mean by that ? 
  you saying that all those austerity measures is n't trying ? 
  is this trying equal as loaning to countries at 4 % when you get it at < 1 % ? 
  yeah it 's our debt and our responsibility but the same way this surplus is germany 's responsibility . 
  what does uk has to do with eurozone ? 
  do n't you even know what eurozone means ? 
  the man monkey did n't answer you , i wonder why, 
  i may have a surprise for you ... those women were n't really women , maybe you are wrongly accustomed . 
  i do n't know what kind of math you are doing but 14469/85500 is around 16,9 % and data is from 2015 , as recent as it can get since we are in january of 2017 . 
  portugal is around 17 % at the moment .

  data that i could find goes to [ salaries being almost equal in greece an estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) and [ estonia actually having better gdp per capita than greece ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_\\ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_capita ) . 
  with that data that you provided , prices are usually 10-15 points higher in food and household stuff . 
  so in the end statistics actually go with that greece being more expensive to live than estonia .

  i 'm sorry apple but in europe consumers have rights , 
  and even after 16years of slow growth they are the 4th eu 's economy with a gpd per capita pairing with eu 's mean . 
  you can be another disaster prophet as much as you want but you ca n't deny truth . 
  still with many many austerity measures and a economy that is changing from low pay industry to high tech we are growing at eu 's speed . 
  the fact that is starting to going down as a % of gdp , you call italy weak economy and say that portugal had high debt before joing euro means that you know nothing about what you are talking about . 
  just because they have high debts now , does n't mean they had when they joined euro . 
  the difference is the point where you start counting and i 'm not confusing anything .

  as the title says this is n't just a group this is a powerhouse to lead reforms that will not take into account many countries opinions and , at the same time , will limit how eurozone/eu can progress while taking everyone opinion . 
  imagine that you create a group with the four bigger economies in euro , create guidelines to follow and then `` anyone can join '' . 
  that 's cannibalizing the opinion of every smaller country because now , suddenly , eurozone has already a group doing something in group without taking everyone 's opinion . 
  how would you feel if now there was a group of countries composed of everyone except france and germany pushing for something that germany does n't want ? 
  they tell you that `` you do n't need to join '' or `` you join if you want '' but will keep developing `` their '' eurozone without taking your opinion into account ? 
  that 's wrong and will undermine eu/eurozone . 
  a good way to cannibalize every smaller country .

  i have listened to the speech live . 
  she kept contradicting herself in a lot of areas . 
  she claimed that they are leaving the eu entirely , so , `` no keeping bits of the eu '' , which initially dismisses any possibility of a bespoke deal . 
  then she goes to say that the uk ideally would still have some sort of `` access '' to the single market :  so we do not seek membership of the single market . 
  instead we seek the greatest possible access to it through a new , comprehensive , bold and ambitious free-trade agreement . 
  basically , she wants access to the single market , free if possible , while having her own immigration controls . 
  this , in itself , is already a bespoke deal of some sort . 
  well , did it ? 
  fully agree with you , it does n't make sense . 
  on the other hand , you also have people on the other side of the spectrum ( some leave supporters ) that feel a-ok with the idea of possibly punishing other eu nations/nationals . 
  there 's a lot of shitty people on both sides of the argument , no point on arguing about that . 
  now we should just move on and look for a deal that is fair for both parties . 
  no one wants to `` punish '' the uk . 
  you are currently in the eu and pay a membership fee to do so and in return you have benefits . 
  there are also some opt-outs in the case of the uk . 
  if you leave the eu and stop paying the membership fee then you also lose the benefits . 
  that 's it ; it 's not rocket science . 
  this is no form of punishment at all .

  it actually is n't . 
  he was referring to mr-oldfart 's comment , not yours , hence why he said it 's irrelevant to * your * comment , despite your comment being accurate or not .

  i do n't think it is a no-brainer honestly . 
  in specific cases , you want to prioritise how skilled someone is and not so much where they are from . 
   people are also very aware of some companies only advertising abroad so that they can pay far cheaper wages . 
  what kind of industries are we talking about ? 
  in a big portion of these cases , companies advertise abroad because there could be a lack of skilled national workforce , not specifically to lower the wages . 
   this is not the same as what you 're implying , though . 
  as i have said before , i agree with you that there are several reasons to want better control of immigration . 
  but if you prioritise british nationals first , effectively the others will only have a chance once there is n't any more british workforce left . 
  take this as you will but the `` immigrants are stealing our jobs '' rhetoric , as daft as it sounds , is a valid way of interpreting this specific scenario . 
  i thought you were joking but it 's actually true . 
  - do you seek to engage in terrorist activities while in the united states or have you ever engaged in terrorist activities ? 
  - are you a member or representative of a terrorist organization ? 
  - have you ever or do you intend to provide financial assistance or other support to terrorists or terrorist organizations ? 
   people have many reason for wanting to control immigration . 
  i completely agree with you . 
  however , one of those reasons is prioritising british workers when recruiting to jobs ( 67 % according to a [ poll by yougov on immigration ] ( http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/88q0g7tq8f/yg-archive-140211-channel5-immigration.pdf ) ) , which is basically a nicer way of putting things instead of saying `` i do n't want immigrants stealing our jobs '' . 
   nobody said `` immigrants are stealing our jobs '' . 
  that 's a / r/europe meme . 
  `` immigrants are stealing our jobs '' - the sentence in itself may be a / r/europe meme , but several polls showed that having total control over immigration policies is the strongest factor amongst leave voters on which policy should be prioritised ( second most popular choice is `` access to the single market '' ) . 
  i 'm confused when people say `` you left the eu '' because i know some of them mean `` you voted to leave '' . 
  on the other hand , i believe that there are people that genuinely think that the uk has already left . 
  not sure which case this one is . 
  no , it 's the new lodgy . 
  koji tsuruoka ( nissan ) said that nissan remaining in the uk will depend on the profits of the company . 
  he also claimed that the most important bit is the combination of no tariffs and no obstruction for the free flow of parts , and the future of this is still uncertain , depending on the type of post-brexit arrangement . 
  as for google , this project for reallocating staff into the uk and building a new hq is something being planned since 2013 . 
  sundar pichai ( google ) also said that barriers to skilled immigration would put some of google 's investment at risk . 
  simply put , i do not believe that brexit is the apocalypse that many people imagine it to be . 
  however , thinking it will be the best thing ever is also slightly surrealistic .

  or at least kacynski opposes it . 
  he 's contradicting itself . 
  nato wo n't defend us if we need it . 
  the us has failed us as an ally many times and with trump , the relation will be even worst . 
  besides , it 's time to take care of our defense instead of relying on the us for everything . 
  i do n't trust nato and the very fact that it is too interventionist is the reason why we should seek an alternative for our defense . 
  besides , we ca n't count on it when the us , turkey or the uk are turning their backs on us . 
  the army could even be ( and probably would be ) based on a article that stated it would only fight for the common defense , or something along those lines . 
  that 's why i do n't really understand the opposition to it . 
  it 's an humane measure , by accepting third generation immigrants as citizens since they are , after all , already part of the society and it wo n't increase immigration , anyway . 
  i do n't expect anyone to say : `` i will immigrate to switzerland because my grandchildren will be able to get citizenship and , provided that i can brainwash my children and their children , we will replace their culture with our own . 
  ca n't the people of those places organize themselves , if they want to change the name , and propose to the government to change it ? 
  but those votes are tied together . 
  the prime-minister ( president of the ep ) is nominate by the chief of state ( in this case it would be juncker ) , in most countries . 
  unless in a monarchy , the chief of state would be voted in and , in many countries , the chief would also has veto powers . 
  in the eu case , the parliament nominates both the president of the ep and the european commission , which often works independently of the ep . 
  if the people only voted for the ep , why are other institutions with higher power controlling europe and often ignore the only elected body ? 
  it would be simpler to have two ballots : one for the parliament and one for the president of the european commission , with the later being able to nominate the president of the ep , instead of the current byzantine network in which the people are unable to understand where the decisions came from and thus , get the people in charge accountable for their actions . 
  no wonder people complain against the eu if it is incapable of the transparency needed for a functioning democratic government . 
  i 'm criticizing juncker for that , i 'm criticizing the process . 
  the ec and the ep are two different institutions . 
  ep has legislative power , and the ec has executive power . 
  it 's not in the ep right to grant executive power to anyone if we want to ensure separation of powers . 
  just because they tell me they will do it beforehand does n't mean i ca n't criticize the process and demand it to be more democratic . 
  so give me a vote on the ep and in the ec or else the ec has few to none legitimacy . 
  i 'm not a huge fan of someone who is capable of exerting executive power without being elected , but that 's only general criticism of the commission . 
  i gave my power to the european parliament , not to juncker and he does n't seem to understand that . 
  he lost my respect with the asymmetric way he treats countries , like his `` because it is france '' argument regarding the budget . 
  he 's a divisive figure and he is exactly what europe does n't need right now . 
  from my understanding , there was not an actual popular vote , but a government one , right ? 
  also , can you tell us what does steinmeier actually mean for germany and for europe , like his political positions and if he 's popular or influential in germany ? 
  they would n't be destroying themselves . 
  their immigration rules are still pretty strict and they would actually be rewarding people who are part of the society and embraced swiss culture , since they would be granting citizenship to third generation immigrants . 
  most of the times second generation immigrants already embraced the culture of the new country , so this policy would n't destroy `` switzerland 's culture '' . 
  i love this comment . 
  i kind of shock by it , but i have to agree . 
  russia and the us have all the monopoly of it and there is no mad deterrent if they are in the same side . 
  if the us and russia are not willing to disarm , i 'm really sad to say , europe might have to consider going nuclear . 
  i think it 's quite likely the eu might cease to exist . 
  there are immense pressures right now , from the inside ( backlash against refugees , disappointment with the eu politics ... ) and from the outside ( trump 's us , russia , turkey and the uk ) . 
  if we pass 2017 , i think we will be in a bit better shape , but the eu needs to send a strong answer that it will fight for the europeans . 
  i would care a lot . 
  i think the eu needs a major political reform , i would like a closer union . 
  yes and no . 
  i usually do n't wear shoes in my own home , just because of confort , but we have no problem wearing shoes inside . 
  in fact , it 's even strange if you go to someone 's house and start taking your shoes . 
  regarding sleeping , i do n't think any european sleeps with their shoes on . 
  i learnt english and had three years of french ( ca n't speak anymore , but i can still easily read it ) . 
  students often have spanish instead of french . 
  english is taught from very early age . 
  i do n't feel european before portuguese , but i consider myself an european citizen and i 'm proud of that . 
  i quite like the idea of being an european citizen and not only portuguese . 
  well , with trump in the us , the warming of us-russia ties at expense of europe , the attacks from the uk and turkey we are seeing nato becoming more and more irrelevant . 
  at this point , a common army that would insure our common defense would be more effective that relying on nato for it . 
  this is actually quite a good one . 
  no way !, 
  good . 
  can we get a nice leader now ? 
  someone who actually unites europe instead of favoring some countries at the others expense ? 
  it would be nice . 
  it will . 
  english will still basically be the lingua franca of europe . 
  do n't expect french or german to replace it , even with brexit . 
  fact : you did n't get the joke .

  i 'm a bit confused about your comment . 
  are genuinely asking or implying i 'm wrong ? 
  i 'm feeling picky , so ... poor ~ ~ kaliningrad ~ ~ k\u00f6nigsberg , does n't belong nowhere . 
  also , i see you 've included most of east thrace , but excluded ~ ~ istanbul ~ ~ ~ ~ constantinople ~ ~ byzantium . 
  also there 's some good chance warsaw has no category .

  there 's no such thing as too much eu4 . 
  but seriously , that game gave me a lot of insight into several medieval political structures i never thought it existed in that timeframe . 
   ** article 6 **  for the purpose of article 5 , an armed attack on one or more of the parties is deemed to include an armed attack :   on the territory of any of the parties in europe or north america , on the algerian departments of france , on the territory of or on the islands under the jurisdiction of any of the parties in the north atlantic area north of the tropic of cancer ; on the forces , vessels , or aircraft of any of the parties , when in or over these territories or any other area in europe in which occupation forces of any of the parties were stationed on the date when the treaty entered into force or the mediterranean sea or the north atlantic area north of the tropic of cancer .

  interesting question . 
  i would like to see a modern nation working with an ancient greece model or a merchant federation hansa style . 
  like a loose alliance of self governing cities with preferably a focus on direct democracy . 
  it would be interesting to know if they would be able and how well they would fare with the modern politics and economics . 
  scandinavia or benelux would be in a better track for a federation test than france and germany .

  why are turks voting for a turkish party in europe ? 
   i have to say that was pretty shocking for me the first time i read the qu ` ran . 
  in one sura , muhammad says christians and jews are brothers in faith and it is nonsense to fight until they see who 's right . 
  a couple of suras later , he condemn them to the death because of their offenses to allah . 
  so , in my opinion , it depends on which sura you decide to trust . 
  naskh ( \u0646\u0633\u062e ) is an arabic language word usually translated as `` abrogation '' ; it is a term used in islamic legal exegesis for seemingly contradictory material within or between the two primary sources of islamic law : the quran and the sunna . 
  several qur ` anic verses state that some revelations in the quran have been abrogated and substituted by later revelations . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] the principle of abrogation of an older verse by a new verse of quran , or within the hadiths is a well established principle in sharia . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] the possibility of abrogation between these two primary sources of islam , though , has been a more contentious issue . 
  [ 6 ] the allowability of abrogation between sources has been one of the major differences between the shafi'i and hanafi fiqhs , with shafi'i sect of jurisprudence forbidding abrogation by the sunna of the qur ' \u0101n , while hanafi sect allowing abrogation by the sunna of the qur ' \u0101n . 
  [ 7 ] [ 8 ] seventy one of the quran 's one hundred fourteen surah contain abrogated verses according to one estimate . 
  [ 9 ] muslim exegetes and jurists have disagreed and disputed the number of verses of the quran and sunnah in the hadiths recognized as abrogated .

   so when you say `` christians do not seek an earthly kingdom '' you do n't mean actual existing christians who historically very much did seek earthly kingdoms ? 
  i think it matters if their actions where justified by their faith . 
  from a doctrinal point . 
  vatican two is where it all started going wrong . 
  correct me if im wrong but i was under the impression that christians do not seek an earthly kingdom as their end goal but islam seeks physical dominion as theirs . 
   i mean if you forfeit your privacy , right to habeas corpus if the circumstances are right , it 's not like europeans are doing much better in this regard and some of them even get a police visit when they say `` this shit sucks '' .

   few of what we now call our european values existed before the 20th century , and really most didnt exist before the 1960s . 
  this was on my mind as i replied to the op . 
   when you find yourself in a hole you should stop digging but but what about our `` european values '' !!, 
  do you have a guarantee that the mistakes of europe will not be made in australia , i 'm pretty sure they already have been made it 's just that australia lacks the scale of people moving in to make it readily apparent . 
  i have never ever heard of a group of people moving about within the same country referred to as migration . 
  he also has a [ history ] ( http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/05/is-it-islamophobic-to-draw-attention-to-sadiq-khans-links-with-extremists/ ) of defending islamists and and sharing speaking platforms with them . 
   you do n't have to go back very far in khan 's past to find links with some pretty unsavoury characters . 
  some of these associations date back to his time as a director of liberty and a human rights lawyer -- trying to get the uk to lift its ban on the american nation of islam leader louis farrakhan , who has described jews as ` blood-suckers ' and called hitler ` a very great man ' , and speaking at the same conference as sajeel abu ibrahim , a member of the now proscribed islamist organisation that trained the 7/7 bomber mohammad sidique khan . 
  but other instances are less easily explained away by his professional commitments . 
   for instance , in 2004 he appeared on a platform with five islamic extremists at a conference in london organised by al-aqsa , a group that has published works by the notorious holocaust denier paul eisen . 
  he was billed not as a director of liberty or human rights lawyer , but as a labour parliamentary candidate . 
   in the same year , khan was the chair of the muslim council of britain 's legal affairs committee and was involved in defending the muslim scholar dr yusuf al-qaradawi , whom the mcb described as ` a voice of reason and understanding ' . 
  at the time , the mcb issued a press release blaming the ` smear campaign ' against qaradawi on ` the zionist lobby ' . 
  khan himself gave evidence to the house of commons home affairs select committee in which he said ` there is a consensus among islamic scholars that mr al-qaradawi is not the extremist that he is painted as being ' . 
   that 's a government failure . 
  not a guarantee . 
  so pretty much a guarantee then . 
  it also refers to people from a certain geographic location . 
  i was talking about the caucasians . 
   to be fair that criticism was deserved . 
  especially with what 's happening in those places now . 
  there is already ethnic neighborhoods , would you like to add ghettos in the mix ? 
  they are not considered migrants if they are already in the country and have been for a few hundred years ... 
  i like how the majority of likes are in the 50 % mark but the bars seem to start shrinking after luxemborg . 
  all that is needed is the impression that it negates mad . 
   at best they 'd only take out a small number of missiles . 
  all it takes is for one side to believe that they would have an edge , once you cease to have m.a.d then we will see an arms race in nuclear tech again . 
   there are no russian troops invading ukraine/georgia comrade , it 's just imperialist western propaganda . 
  would not have happened if the west was n't pushing a colour revolution in ukraine . 
  is n't the point of the missile defence the ability to shoot down the missiles headed towards any second strike facilities , in that case you would have to devote some attention on the defence sites . 
   why couldnt they make joint eu-russia-us shield ? 
  because the west needs the big baddie russia , despite the official line that this is aimed at iran i foresee a future in which it will be pointed at russia . 
  which is why missile shields are such a worry . 
  at this stage m.a.d is assured but once one side believes that they are gaining or loosing ground then the situation becomes volatile . 
  it is actually a fairly accurate picture of what would happen should muck war break out , it 's up to the individual countries involved if the benefits outweigh the risks . 
   come on , the guy had a talking car . 
  how can you not like that . 
  that was michael knight . 
  why do you ? 
  time for cheeky breeky ? 
  not for long .

  i never disputed that . 
  that creates a problem in itself ( calais , for instance ) that must be tackled by the british gov. , like it or not . 
   sorry but crossing the med to france is far harder than crossing to the uk ? 
  i call bollocks partially because the the crossing from africa to france is much further , people have successfully swum the channel . 
  the south coast of france is also smaller than that of the uk 's south coast and therefore one would assume more easily patrolled by the coast guard . 
  i 'm talking about illegal immigrants coming from the mediterranean , not about how easier is to cross the channel compared to reach french south coast . 
  their goal is to reach the uk and the easiest way is to cross the channel from france . 
  that 's it . 
  i do n't have any suggestions . 
  not my job and ( obviously ) not qualified to present such . 
  the uk rules are not specially strict , but they are more than other eu countries , like germany . 
  the uk receives a shittone of immigrants , from everywhere , but there are many many more , even the unskilled ones , that want to join . 
  decades of catering unskilled immigration from all around the world created the percepetion that the uk as the same needs and everyone will find a job , raise a family and build a pretty nice life for them . 
  i know the economy as changed and the need is n't the same as it was , but a significant part of the immigrants do n't . 
  and because they ca n't reach the uk legally , they try in other ways , because there 's a significant black market jobs for immigrants in the uk . 
  a well known fact . 
  so maybe fighting illegal job market should be the number one concern , and will act as a deterrent in the future . 
  the rules are the problem because they are too strict , as in people struggled to get their work visa application approved in their home countries . 
  and because they want to work in the uk , because of many factors , which english language is one of the main ones , coupled with the strict immigration rules it has created the problem . 
  and this is blatant to anyone . 
  and cooperation with france is way more than tackling the calais juggle and you know that . 
  did i say fault ? 
  i said it 's cause of it . 
  let 's acknowledge that first , shall we . 
  france in fact has very little control of its borders , as they are in schengen area and they are not an island in a corner of europe that only `` borders '' rich and stable countries . 
  france as other mediterranean countries struggle to keep their borders in check against boats full of immigrants/refugees who throw their passports into the sea and do n't want to register in france , only want to go to the uk . 
  so instead of spending millions of euros feeding , housing and clothing people against their will , without cooperation from the destiny country ( uk ) , france is pretty much tired of it and decided to let them camp outside calais and let the problem resolve itself out or finally bring the uk to the table and let them assume their share of the burden . 
  yes , the rules are the main culprit . 
  the uk does n't allow those people to come to the country . 
  and legitimately so . 
  it 's up to them to set the rules that the british people wish . 
  but that does n't change the fact that they want to go to the uk , and the uk only , regardless of either they are legal there or not . 
  that 's why they camp outside calais . 
  simple as that . 
  as for what the uk should do . 
  i do n't know , but it should start with maybe trying to directly work with france instead of simply trying to deflect the problem to france , like most of the british politicians seem to be doing and/or proposing . 
  well , france is dealing with the problem in calais and other solely because of your immigration rules . 
  i do n't see the uk government politely discussing with france regarding british laws on immigration , despite those directly impacting what 's happening in france . 
  edit : typo . 
  why would they feel the need to consult the uk about opening a refugee camp within their own borders ? 
   outmuscle anyone anyone but shaq , 
  if serbia ca n't remove kebab , kebab removes serbia .

  we cover everything . 
  this is the type of author that fails to see what the ukrainian war meant for russia . 
  they never wanted to fully occupy ukraine . 
  only to destabilise the country after going against their previous political pact and to regain crimea to please the nationalistic ego of many . 
  donbass will not be incorporated into russia , that why they did n't send direct troops , only paramilitary and disguised troops . 
  donbass will be a frozen conflict for many decades , a la transnistria and other unrecognised republics in former soviet union countries . 
  sanctions did n't stop russia 's military incursion into ukraine . 
  they simple achieved their political goal , and of course the economical crisis coming from the significant oil drop made the continuation of the war something that should n't go on .

  did n't knew that madrid was n't important prior to that date . 
  a number of reasons : - in medieval times both were more concern with the reconquista and in the renaissance both were more concern with their colonies ; - spain was only formed in the end 15 ~ ~ 16 ~ ~ th century , with the union of castile , l\u00e9on and aragon and the conquest of granada . 
  so prior to that madrid had always to make alliances to go to war with portugal and have a shot at winning ; - portugal population is n't significant inferior in numbers to spain ( especially before the creation of spain ) . 
  is about 4-to-1 , which meat that they always had to bring there a game to face us ; - north and centre of portugal is quit mountainous and had a lot of forests . 
  hard conditions for an invasion ; - portugal was always a very diplomatic country , making a shit tone of marriages with the various iberian crowns and making alliances with other countries ( england , for starts ) . 
  this meant that for most of our history spain-portugal relations were good . 
  they may have legal grounds to get independence . 
  however , those are kind messy and always depends on international politics . 
  even in western democracies independence of regions that are inhabited by the non-majority group in the country are always very hard to come by . 
  the thing about international law regarding independence of regions is that it only works if the big countries want for it to work . 
  russia did n't want to part ways with chechnya , so people can argue all they want about the legality of it , but that will not change the fact that other than being successful in the battleground chechens would n't have been able to get independence . 
  sure , but that was n't the point . 
   on a piece of land they have no business or history with is not like it has been part of russia for 2 centuries or anything . 
  you are absolutely right . 
  when god created the world he did a perfect job and everything and everyone has a plan .

  the important questions . 
  because latvia is rightful russian clay , you silly goose . 
  what the actual fuck !? 
  you only need a a singular and plural for masculine and feminine . 
  that what being out of reach of civilization gets you . 
  most portuguese and spanish words related to war , weapons and such are of germanic origin ( visigoths and suebis ) . 
  i remember reading about this in school . 
  they assumed the role left by the romans as leaders and warriors , but they basically merged with the locals , thus adopting romance dialects , and did n't have a relevant influence in other aspects of life , which can be seen in the small influence in terms of the number of germanic words in the languages . 
  the moors on the other hand , because they were a lot more advance in science and agriculture left traces of their presence in the peninsula in the lexicon related to those matters . 
  funny how we can trace past civilization and people and their influence in certain regions in today 's languages . 
  for portuguese people is basically a free language , but the opposite is n't true . 
  we have twice the phonemes , thus they really struggle to understand us . 
  but nonetheless if you did n't had spanish classes or studied by yourself you will find really hard to speak proper , as there are many differences in syntax and many false friends , plus there are many differences in terms of orthography in similar words . 
  why , may i ask ?

  tolerance is almost mandatory when you are the small minority and you control every bit of power . 
  of course . 
  if it 's built it should be used and try to give them the best conditions . 
  but it just shows how our government , former at least , only cares how the international community sees the country . 
  you would n't find houses like that being used as public housing for the locals in need . 
  and the vast majority of people would struggle like hell to buy all of this , given that we are one of the countries where the utilities , petrol , housing and day-to-day expenses are proportionality the most expensive among eu countries . 
  the moment you realize that the houses ( on the inside at least ) build for the refugees are way better than yours . 
  if they do n't want to come to portugal , a country with one of the warmer temperatures in the eu ( most similar to the middle east ) and just a bit below eu average wages , they will sure want to go to estonia or poland . 
  in my country there 's a saying : `` you do n't look to the teeth of a horse that was given to you '' [ rough translation ] . 
  this just shows that if they ca n't get in into the richer european countries , they would rather return to turkey or other middle eastern countries than to come to poorer eu countries . 
  and i do n't blame them . 
  in there you are close to your surroundings , have probably better job opportunities ( smaller discrimination , lesser language barrier , more useful skills for their economies , etc. ) . 
  this just shows that the quota program was made by people that are disconnected with the reality and approved something that only makes sense on paper . 
  it 's the new gospel !, 
  mate , pontius pilate ask the jews what they want to do and they said to nail him to the cross . 
  i saw mel gibson 's the passion of the christ . 
  damn , dirty jews , pontius did n't want to do it . 
  he was force to . 
  hey , they did nailed down our lord and saviour , did n't they ? 
  i will see if you ( and others here ) keep the same rhetoric when a turkish jet violates syrian airspace and the russian military shoots it down . 
  you ca n't come out saying that they go after that group . 
  of course it will be a law banning everyone to cover their head in public , which is mind boggling . 
  one thing is in a public building , bank , etc. , which demands more security and scrutiny . 
  another completely different is on the street , where and individual should be able to express themselves freely as long as he does n't put anyone at risk . 
  which of course those women do n't do . 
  they owned that 3km strip for a whole 17 seconds . 
  they had it coming . 
  yes , the beginnings of a police state . 
  let 's not ignore the elephant in the room the , islamism terrorism , that has made the necessity of creating this draconian law . 
  this is targeting a group . 
  pure and simple . 
  i 'm not disputing that . 
  but one thing is to feel in danger ( like crossing the street at night with a young male in a hoodie or a bandana ) another is the law assuming a priori that people wearing a particular type of clothing are , especially a notorious religious outfit , are in dangering others . 
  which for me is nothing more than a lame excuse to persecute a religious group . 
  so a person walking around in the street with the face covered up is a danger ? 
  i understand that in schools ( does n't reveal the identity of the student ) or in a bank with may make sense to be forbidden . 
  but on the street ? 
  what that accomplish other than being a complete attack on an individual 's religion ? 
  this starts to be dangerously close to a police state . 
  repression of a particular group in the name of safety . 
  i guess you are missing the point . 
  one thing is to shoot a jet that entered your areal space , which seems to be case of today ( even though it 's a complete overreaction ) . 
  another is to shoot any plane that comes close to the border , which is a clear cut act of war . 
  after that russia has causis belli to threaten turkey with a nuclear attack . 
  there 's a reason that neither the us , china , russia , france , uk ( excluding oversees territories ) and more recently israel , india and pakistan have n't been attacked by anyone . 
  why would the us hold want to be involved in a possible nuclear war with russia over turkey when they can easily said to the remainder of nato allies that turkey start a war and that article 5 does n't protect you if you are the attacker . 
  if someone attacks you we will be there for you , but not in the opposite situation . 
  article 5 applies as defence measure . 
  that comment i was replying to was describing a direct attack to any `` every plane that comes close '' to the border . 
  do you think the us would risk nuclear annihilation to protect turkey after they started a war with russia . 
  i do n't think so . 
  there 's nothing stopping russia from deploying a fifth of their nuclear arsenal and pointing them to the 30 most populous cities in turkey also and say : `` i dare you to shoot another jet '' . 
  to a lesser extent . 
  but some of the concepts and rhetoric are also used in this side of pond . 
  linda is the female adjective of beautiful in portuguese ... 
  that or they will shoot down the next turkish plane that flies over syria to bomb some nato target . 
  nah , mate , you got it all wrong . 
  when big business have a tax break they will employ more people and get the jobs in our country . 
  they will not have ridiculous wages for the board members and the money in the cayman islands . 
  no sir . 
  all the tax breaks will be invested in the local economy . 
  it is known . 
  trickle down economics , you commie !, 
  assad at this point does n't dream of getting back the lost territories to the kurds . 
  russia can easily please assad with give him the territories ( if they gain them in battle , of course ) of al-nusra , daesh and the many militias supported by the west and at the same time arm the shit out of the kurds , both in syria and turkey , and in that way weaken turkey in the inside . 
  turkey already struggles to control pkk and a big chuck of territory is kinda a warzone . 
  just imagine if russia starts to directly supporting the kurds in turkey . 
  scary times ahead .

  but rather saying that the child poverty in portugal was widely aggravated in the last 6,7,8 years due to the euro crisis . 
  the uk did n't have that , so both countries being the same level just shows the complete neglect that the british government is showing to the problem . 
  is crazy to think that portugal and the uk are in the same level .

  portugal is having a deep financial crisis that sunk half of the population to poverty , borderline poverty . 
  the uk is n't .

  and yes , it \u00b4 s an important concept for controlling hooliganism . 
   fuck that . 
  i wo n't drink my wine in plastic bottles because some idiots wan na see a bunch of rich retards hit a ball . 
  i am just going to quote that . 
  and a word of warning , being able to predict crowd problems is not about foreigners , it \u00b4 s about your own safety and the safety of people actually living there , all of them . 
  and usually one of these tournaments is a really good opportunity to improve , to learn , to test security measures . 
  not to say , everything is fine and is the fault of foreign rich retards , because evidently it \u00b4 s not . 
  and what you learn about controlling sports hooligans , maybe winkwinknudgenudge might be helpful for other situations . 
   154 polish arrested , 24 russians . 
  that 's fine for you ? 
  i was the one who posted that to you yesterday as a great example of what to do !, 
  and you throwing it back as something undesirable ? 
  yeah , if people are causing trouble , they should be arrested , for the safety of all others . 
  why should arresting trouble makers not `` be fine '' ? 
  that is what you do . 
   dude go troll sole other place cuz you 're boring . 
  ca n't even google . 
  geesh . 
  friday 10th - day 1 saturday 11th - day 2 today is day 3 of euro 2016 . 
   only about 20 frenchmen were involved . 
  you ca n't micromanage everything you know . 
  actually yeah , you can . 
  you can keep an eye out on local ultras and their plans , you can put undercover cops around fans and have an eye out and maybe some intervention police nearby out of sight . 
  you can do things like forbidding the sale of drinks , even in supermarkets in glass bottles because they are stupidly dangerous , you can check if there is no loose easy to throw heavy stuff around . 
  a lot of this football violence is agent provocateurs ( a french concept by the way ) hooligans of one kind or another , sometimes under false flags attacking others and then using a group feeling threatened to attack another one , creating violence for the kicks . 
  it \u00b4 s really important to identify ( and undercover , or bringing police who are acquainted with them from beforehand , having files ) them before they can start trouble . 
  it \u00b4 s almost like france has never handled football matches before . 
  it \u00b4 s weird , in euro 2012 there were all these doomsday predictions about violent ultras and racism and bad planning , but it went out fine , and now france of all places is the place with out of control ultras , heavy handed but ineffective police and flares and rushes in stadiums . 
  and it \u00b4 s only day 3 . 
   the behavior of certain fans is france 's fault ? 
  `` fans '' in an euro match in france having flares and smoke bombs is france \u00b4 s fault . 
  france authorities not having predicted some `` fans '' might rush others and having no visible police in a stadium is france \u00b4 s faults . 
  drinks in glass bottles out on a french town being sold plentifully before a dangerous match is france \u00b4 s fault . 
  using tear gas indiscriminately is france \u00b4 s fault ( match ticket holders in the entrance for a match ? 
  seriously ? ) . 
  not being good at crowd control is incompetent . 
  not arresting the people actually causing trouble , whatever their nationalities , is a problem . 
  you can \u00b4 t use tribalism to ignore problems . 
  it \u00b4 s like the french authorities did not bother to research anything on how to prevent problems from occurring at these type of events , how to control crowds in order to keep hooligans isolated and powerless and without impact , and as such not able to affect the large majority of innocent fans . 
  did you notice previous euros and world cups ? 
  the thing about the european union is that we can learn from other countries and in things they do better , copy their good practices . 
  violent hooligans wanting to cause trouble are not something new , every major tournament has to have a plan to deal with them , lots of cl and uefa matches . 
  and local authorities , for the safety of all innocent fans and bystanders , better have good plans , learn how to prevent things . 
  and a lot of what we have seen directly on tv is a sign the french authorities are being very bad at it . 
  smoke bombs , flares in an euro match is inexcusable . 
  it \u00b4 s criminally dangerous as well , not just as a sign that if `` fans '' could have brought them , terrorist could have brought something else , but because panics in enclosed spaces are extremely dangerous things . 
   okay it 's a bit hilarious i admit . 
  of course , bad policing and crowd control planning is oh so hilarious if we can make it about tribalism . 
  then you should have passed organizing the euro to another country , 6 months was more than enough time . 
  but it didn \u00b4 t. 
  and what happens inside a stadium matters as well , because the whole world is seeing live . 
  and not being able to control people bringing in fucking flares and smoke bombs in an euro game does not raise much confidence about france \u00b4 s ability to fry any fish . 
  and if they brought smoke bombs they could have brought others . 
  btw this is nice reading , the opening match iirc of the euro 4 years ago and it seemed to have been relatively quiet afterwards http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/euro-2012-blood-on-the-streets-as-183-880622 183 people arrested . 
  so yeah , france should go and arrest , of any side . 
  but this organizing is pathetic . 
  if you invite people to come to the euros you host , you got the responsability to the best to keep everybody safe from attack . 
  without trying to turn things into tribalism . 
  your bigger fish to fry, 
   here 's english fans chanting `` isis where are you '' and `` isis we love you '' . 
  those people should get arrested according to french law . 
  why didn \u00b4 t they , then ? 
  because that is the way you create a safe environment , by actively persecuting people who are a danger to others or breaking the law , not creating tribal warfare and using oh a piece of news of some people in another ocasion to justify extremely bad planning . 
  or do you mean the only people in danger in the stadium were the ones doing the chants and that is why that is ok ? 
   the crs should descend upon them but i guess they do n't want the bad press . 
  oh , bad press . 
  that must hurt . 
  and will hurt as well how the fuck do people get into a game like this with fireworks/flares whatever . 
   weird that it does n't happen with other fans though . 
  weird indeed . 
  which fans would that be ? 
  none but the russians or none but the english ? 
  because it happens ( and frequently ) , has happened and quite likely will happen again and soon . 
  i don \u00b4 t know where the police was , but obviously they should have had real police , maybe out of sight but near the border areas . 
  maybe they were wrongly focused on the outside danger , but the whole planning is looking absolutely atrocious . 
  come on , they could have asked , checked how previous tournaments were organized , the beer bottle thing is just wtf-are-bars-selling-glass-bottles , it \u00b4 s basic stuff . 
  and they got teams in the cl , they surely have to have some experience with cl matches , didn \u00b4 t they have a cl final as well ? 
  not just disgraceful behaviour , but wtf have the french been doing about security ? 
  because all the stuff i am seeing on the news , tons of glass bottles being sold and served in town , something like this happening in an euro match , photos of fireworks inside the stadium , there are techniques to prevent shit like this . 
  who the fuck thought it was a good idea to allow bars and caf\u00e9s to keep selling drinks in glass bottles in the days before a russia-england in marseille ? 
  hooligans , idiots , thugs of any nationality will take any openings they find to create trouble . 
  particularly if you let them feel they might be attacked and are just defending themselves by attacking first . 
  and more than saying russians this , english this ; the thing is why didn \u00b4 t the french do more to prevent this ? 
  fireworks in the stadium are totally unacceptable ( if fireworks were brought in so could have other things ) . 
  selling drinks in glass bottles while two huge masses of rival , famously violent , `` fans '' are waiting for a bit match !, 
  actually of world cup 2002 . but also world cup 2010 , and a bunch others which might have had expected result but were weirdly tense . 
  opening games are weird things . 
   but he has dual citizenship though . 
  he 's more than portuguese descent dual citizenship kind of implies from having portuguese descent and having portuguese descent means you can have dual citizenship . 
  and not having portuguese citizenship does not mean we would not consider somebody portuguese ( herman jos\u00e9 ) if they are so culturally , socially . 
  edit - also this day , the whole month is kind about neighbourhood parties , the community . 
  not blood , or ancestors , about the people nearby you help and can help you . 
  and you can hiphenate portuguese as you wish and nobody will conteste the portuguese part . 
  but saying you are `` portuguese '' with no hiphen and not being aware of the 10th of june , no way . 
  you need to qualify that , to explain that with some context , with some other ( main ) nationality as a way of warning us you are not actually portugal portuguese .

  wow , this surprises me, 
  but they still tended to their colonies . 
  not gon na lie , felipe ii was a good king and he kept many promises he made when portugal was `` annexed '' . 
  the other ones fucked up and yes , we are independent . 
  portugal started as a small county during the `` reconquista '' circa 1128 , and in 1179 d. afonso henriques was officially declared king of portugal by the pope , and portugal was recognized as an independent country, 
  because portugal is not a state . 
  it only became part of spain for less than a century because we had no successor and felipe ii of spain was the grandson of a previous king ( manuel i i think ) and that did n't work very well for us . 
  the first felipe was a good king , but the following 2 successors did n't give a crap about portugal and it 's colonies , and many colonies were taken from us by the dutch , and spain did nothing . 
  portugal has been independent since 1143 , and it 's older than spain for a few centuries, 
  so why does n't spain become part of a great portugal ? 
  why does n't austria unite with germany again ? 
  why is poland not part of germany if they were part of prussia ? 
  i was asking a question , and you are being an asshole, 
  pretty obvious troll ... 
  why are n't italy regions also pushing for independence if it 's about money ? 
  and the whole spain is in crisis , suddenly becoming independent wo n't change that, 
  why are the spanish regions so focused on being independent again ? 
  heil god is way better, 
  we make fun of ourselves mostly, 
  the thing is , the curriculum is very different , in all subjects . 
  and when it comes to reading , in portuguese and english schools , mandarin is optional , so it 's probably a mix between the mandarin/cantonese , portuguese and english subjects, 
  what is the macao data based on ? 
  portuguese , chinese or english schools ? 
  or a mix ? 
  the feminists want to tell women what to do , while saying `` do n't tell women what to do '' honestly , i 'm thankful there is n't a big feminists movement in portugal because of crap like this, 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_bhxmym0s0 this will fuck your mind even more, 
  only east poland, 
  well , at least most know where portugal is . 
  it 's not that hard to find geographically , but ` muricans, 
  i 'd be pretty good at placing asia , europe and some south african countries and south american, 
  so we are paying farmers not to produce , and paying fishermen to overfish ? 
  can anybody explain to me what 's the whole point of farming limits ? 
  probably big private lands , like farms, 
  props to danish for making my favorite beer . 
  does wine count as pure alcohol ? 
  time to bring ** the freedom **, 
  * their tea drinking habits come from us * best buddies since 1373 * harry potter ( been to hogwarts , because coca-cola ) * extremely heavy and greasy food * pubs, 
   chances are spain/portugal may have taken over the globe and then we would end up losing it because it was too vast for so few people to manage, 
  * hong kong * macau * dubai * portugal * spain i 'm living in two countries and i travel a lot, 
  it came from china , but it 's pronounced tch\u00e1 . 
  i 'm living in macau , and this was one of the first things i learned . 
  tea is pretty big here, 
  you could also say that the native americans were n't probably the first `` legitimate '' owners , but they are considered to be the first , because you know , `` history '' and legitimate ? 
  being a legitimate owner requires laws and shit and in those days there probably were n't many laws about land ownership, 
  historically the portuguese are considered to be descendants of the lusitani , which were a celtic tribe . 
  kinda like france and the gauls, 
  nowadays , yes , because the mentality is different but if you go back in time , you probably would not have that right . 
  basically , the land `` belonged '' to the celts . 
  then came the romans , and took it . 
  then came the `` barbarians '' from the north , that did n't last much long because the arabs took it then , with the help of france , came the called reconquista ( reconquest ) which began from the region of ast\u00farias . 
  those christians were most likely , in great part , of celtic ascendancy . 
  it was kinda like taking back stolen land unlike america , it was n't sudden , so the cultures kinda blended in . 
  this is probably why you guys in america have so many troubles with racism . 
  because different cultures were suddenly forced upon each other , and they never blended, 
  america is a country europe is a continent , and cultures differ very much from country to country . 
  the eu did n't even exist when all those things you say , happened , so grouping all the members of the eu is pointless ( just like it is now ), 
  so you 're implying america has never done ethnic cleansing ? 
  because you 're basically living on stolen land, 
  holy shit ... 
  questions, 
  still hurts, 
  you have to drive outside of the borders to get decent bread in china, 
  portugal is still a catholic country , and somehow , people tend to accept gay people even my grandmother that goes to church almost everyday , thinks gay people should be allowed to marry, 
  yuropean jography is really hard . 
  there are so many continents in just a single country, 
   why did n't both coal-fired and natural gas-fired power stations produce 70 % less electricity ? 
  their output remained the same , while the energy output produced from renewable sources has increased, 
  corruption is everywhere , in every country, 
  this is probably not relevant to this case , but that is somewhat outdated in some cases for example , in macau the legal drinking age is now 18 , although you can easily get alcoholic beverages although the european countries seem to be updated, 
  the legal drinking age probably plays a huge role here, 
  / r/murica wordcloud is full of `` freedom '' `` damm '' , `` commie '' and `` patriot '', 
  i 'm living in macau , and the eggs you find are us eggs , or chinese eggs i really do n't know which one is better . 
  maybe i should try and find some portuguese eggs . 
  back in portugal i buy eggs from farm chickens ( not the ones cooped and shit ), 
  nope , because of smog china is the new england, 
  shit , you 've just open pandora 's box, 
  try doing the portuguese one . 
  easy as fuck, 
  because we suck at hiding our debts, 
  can we keep madeira ? 
  took me a while, 
  it 's a small country , so there 's no need to move away just for personal space, 
  water, 
  cereals ... 
  people used to eat bread on every meal also . 
  now that `` tradition '' is dying my grandparents still do it, 
  i just use a fork, 
  wait a second . 
  is olive oil full of calories ? 
  in portuguese you can also call it floripa https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/florian%c3%b3polis ctrl + f shows 5 results, 
  we just do n't have any money for drugs, 
   you would n't be blaming religion if the crime were perpetrated by a christian . 
  a lot of people would, 
  i lived in china for 3 years and aussie banter does n't even hold a candle to chinese banter all insults sound a 10x worse in mandarin and 100x worse in cantonese , even when you speak it, 
  so they died in cova da moura ? 
  turkey just delayed even further their eu membership, 
  he already has, 
  i did n't see lisbon, 
  never saw one in lisbon, 
  just like in the good old days,

  the map relates to 2009 figures and in that year there were a little over a 100 000 births and 34 000 abortions !!, 
  at least it 's not a widely discussed issue and there is still very little stigma that i 'm aware of . 
  but this last one is but my opinion ... tl ; dr for good or bad , portugal is , yet again , on the opposite and unexpected side of the charts . 
  lol, 
  melilla is more trouble than it 's worth . 
  although the outcome is a good one , i know that it only stems out of the magistrates selfishness . 
  this is a class that has escaped most of the austerity blunt , due to an immense political leverage . 
  of nearly all measures , they and a few others are repeatedly exempt . 
  they got to keep things like chauffeurs , vehicles , subsidized housing and others , despite them being at the top of earned incomes . 
  the measures they sought to dismiss as unconstitutional were one of the few that would have them penalized . 
  all others they managed to become exempt . 
  i smell a war . 
  not in portugal , i think . 
  then again , there might be some program or scholarship that could make you more eligible for tuition support than the poorest of portuguese students and completely bypass the whole 1000 to 5000 euros per year costs . 
  over here things are at that level of kafkaesque ... 
  i have n't left and i feel my brain being drained . 
  as portuguese , this also sickens me . 
  there is an ongoing effort to dismantle , defund and privatize public education . 
  make it a higher class privilege in what reeks of `` the old days '' of the dictatorship , in which the masses were kept undereducated . 
  and this line of thought has inflitrated unions , political parties and of course , it has the golden touch of the bankster families . 
  in a little over a decade , tuitions rose 400 to 2000 % in some cases . 
  and there are choirs of supposedly enlightened people urging the youths not to pursue higher education , because of high unemployment . 
  such short sightedness ... and tuition help or scholarships have been `` obviously '' replaced by bank loans . 
  as an example from the ways of `` the old days '' , my mother was the smartest little girl in primary school , and this was in a time where there in 4th grade ( end of primary school ) you knew as much as a current day 10th grader . 
  she had so much science and math potential and yet she was unable to continue and put to work at age 9 as a house maid . 
  this crushed entire generations potential . 
  and all of it just to keep the status quo . 
  politics of paranoia . 
  make the voting be about the fear of losing it all . 
  the more you have , the more you stand to lose . 
  but wealth is often painted by politicians as a big bullseye . 
  those who have expectations far beyond what 's reasonable or even possible . 
  in other words , eutopians , multikultis and that priviliged baby boomer generation that has a problem thinking beyond their immediate needs, 
  relevant username . 
  an increasingly less elaborate illusion . 
  the norwegian [ blackmetal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_norwegian_black_metal_scene ) scene , which i followed ( and i admit i still do ) is fascinating . 
  that and the countries beautiful scenery , which is exotically antipodal to ours in the european context . 
  i never met much of the people , apart from musicians like dimmu borgir and the kovenant who played in portugal back in the day . 
  all nice guys . 
  the uk is self sufficient if it ever decides to rely on itself . 
  russia is a prize as valued as the whole of africa . 
  in the coming decades new paradigm , one of nanotechnology , world disorder ( tribalism ) and fierce competition ; living space and basic resources will be highly sought after , and russia has the advantage of having them . 
  however , russia will be torn to shreds from all sides . 
  it 's in a geopolitical trap . 
  china , india and the islam * istans in the south . 
  hungry europe in the west and untrustworthy old us and japan in the east . 
  all \u00fcberdense hordes , moving in with the hunger of billions . 
  this of course , will be in an age where countries do n't matter anymore . 
  weep for russia , only because she is trembling . 
  it 's basically a css issue . 
  portugal does it too . 
  ireland is not the only one . 
  i do n't give a damn about origins , color or credes . 
  as long as the incoming people do n't become disproportionately represented in crime and other unlawful or morally abusive practices . 
  it 's difficult to integrate anyone when there is a mindset of prejudice , but if after a few generations , the newer generations do n't adjust and are actually ( in general ) more radical and poorly integrated , committing more crimes than the natives and refusing to change certain practices , then there is no point in ignoring it , however unfair it may seem . 
  the policies have to change . 
  but those who did n't fail at integration should not be discriminated . 
  a change in policy does n't necessarily need to make a clean slate out of everyone . 
  it just needs to become more enforcive and weed out the bad members . 
  and rehabilitation should n't come by throwing money at the problem . 
  if there is an open door to a country and said country has poorly integrated citizens , then incoming migrants will pick up those bad influences or at the very least be discriminated because of them . 
  it 's very difficult to have this discussion without being buried under downvotes or being lightly labeled an islamophobic racist stormfronter neonazi white supremacist . 
  great !, 
  third time 's the charm !, 
  is of genius !, 
  banks went on a lending spree , going to great lengths to lure people into easy credit . 
  governments and their absent regulation failed miserably to control them , as it is failing now by not letting them be punished for it . 
  there 's a lot of rap fans on this thread ( read the article if you do n't get why i mention rap ) . 
  i read the article and it 's unbiased and objective . 
  and so i shared because it was in english . 
  but i also frowned upon the domain name , though . 
  hate speech . 
  preaching violence towards women and everyone in general . 
  glorifying underachievement and crime . 
  the list goes on ... makes such a good influence on the young . 
  why ? 
  the colder climate favors stronger and taller builds . 
  hotter and wetter climates , favor small shorter builds . 
  you can see this in europe and in china . 
  there are exceptions of course , some african tribes are comprised of skinny giants . 
  but this is mostly due to smaller populations and certain phenotypes that got the chance to shine . 
  that 's why further up the latitudes , we get troll like giants . 
  also , taller people live on average fewer years than average to short ones . 
  ronaldo looks like a pimpled teenager . 
  he 's not good looking at all . 
  face wise ... 
  great . 
  but this is only to highly mechanized factories . 
  the employability behind this is relatively small , however highly skilled !, 
  and all that profit goes straight into corporate offshore accounts . 
  to be fair , historically speaking , the spanish inquisition was a pale shadow of the portuguese inquisition . 
  ours was much more brutal . 
  however , you did gain points for that whole mesoamerican genocide . 
  for a couple of centuries , spain was the spawning grownd of the world 's most vicious mass murderers . 
  we should change name from eu to ku !, 
  * kafkaesque * union also ... `` gangster rapper dmx , who said in one of his songs : `` if you got a daughter older than 15 i 'm gon na rape her '' .

  not only that , but he 's [ touring here next month ] ( http://www.dmxtour.com/europe-tour/ ) !, 
  welcome to the thug . 
  if my daughter was raped , even if remotely linked to this thugs lyrics and ethos , i 'd gun him down myself .

  not interested . 
  just what is rightfully ours . 
  a concept spain keeps forgetting , selectively . 
  who 's willing to join efforts with portugal over the disgraceful and unlawful theft of [ oliven\u00e7a ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olivenza ) ? 
  not to mention the spanish two centuries long botched attempt at erasing the portuguese culture and legacy from the area . 
  i do n't mourn him . 
  he 's covered in virgins by now . 
  a british like insularity . 
  if by valhalla , you mean the afterlife , as in after being dead and destroyed , i tend to agree . 
  a federation of europe will likely end in destruction . 
  but then again , i see even less hope in our current situation . 
  there is too much dividing us and there is just too much xenophobia and ethnocentrism . 
  we all got a notion of just that with the recent crisis . 
  in no time , there came derogatory terms like piigs and lazy and corrupt . 
  the pervasive notion present in everyday discussions and in the media , that southern europeans are subhuman filth compared to the mighty germanic north . 
  and this is not anecdotal , although i 've had my share of hearing germans rant pretty offensively on portuguese and pretty much southern europe . 
  this is also very much present , although a bit toned down , in eu governments , ruling bodies of the eu , the euro parliament . 
  i see that as bad omen for things to come . 
  we may choose to ignore or dismiss this but it will never go away . 
  it will always harm or discriminate people . 
  and this sentiment is being exploited for profit by large financial and banking sector . 
  you see , for wealth that is concentrated like never before , wars are ideal for a quick profit . 
  so are economic recessions in certain countries . 
  to be scooped up on a discount . 
  and the whole euro project . 
  making this botched failure of a plan look like the southerners fault ... unbelievable . 
  who planned this ? 
  were they really that dumb ? 
  they were n't . 
  it was intentionally designed like this . 
  what we 're experiencing now was preordained . 
  and the whole dissonance across the eu on this issue is no coincidence either . 
  nor is it democracy at work . 
  this is the only explanation as to why there are countless diverging opinions from a single eu body . 
  political noise/schizophrenia or perhaps mandated to create chaos and allow an elite to make a quick buck from . 
  before dismissing me as tinfoiler , do an occam 's razor on these same issues . 
  we just ca n't get along . 
  we may never will . 
  we could n't even get along if we had a common foe threatening our very existence . 
  edit : fixed a few typos . 
  and add the fact that this thread , more relevant than any other , has n't gotten any traction , and is actually getting hammered down , speaks of the current condition of the eu . 
  the azores were also considered . 
  salazar however , completely shot the idea down . 
  itt : only positive views . 
  negative ones will get hammered down . 
  why bother ? 
  throwing 50 billion at the roma problem will not solve it . 
  throwing them out of europe will . 
  i would n't be so sure about that . 
  it may not be compulsory but the effects are still similar . 
  over 6 % of the population have already left the country . 
  the undergoing privatization effort is putting natural resources and monopolies in foreign hands . 
  foreign companies , who can finance themselves at much lower rates and have their own governments b backing them , have a huge advantage over portuguese companies . 
  i do n't believe in free market , because there is n't one . 
  i do n't believe good intentions , because the narrow minded calculistic , mindless profit driven stockholder mindset is pervasive . 
  there are no free lunches . 
  the eu was never a free lunch . 
  it was a ticking time bomb just biding it 's time until it began being hijacked by large corporations and financial groups . 
  everything that will happen will happen for the good of the powerful and not the citizens of europe . 
  it was in publico . 
  it was obviously fictional , but carried some legitimacy or at least plausibility . 
  what will happen when there 's no more rope to pull ? 
  a lot we did n't see happening , like for example the reversal of basic rights and quality of services/life . 
  life expectancy is down . 
  healthcare efficiency ratings are down . 
  quality of water is down . 
  prices are up . 
  social benefits are way down . 
  a 400 % increase in unemployment over 4 years . 
  interest rates are up . 
  housing costs are way up . 
  education , fuel , medicine , food , all increasing in rates far bigger than wages , that are being cut . 
  i hate to say this , but the eu is a pipe dream . 
  we 'll end up far worse than we entered the cee . 
  in 5 years , at current rates of `` extortion '' , all the infrastructure , all the liberties and quality of life we had , even before joining the eu , will become out of reach to the global population . 
  sure , the privatizations will keep some things running , but the costs will be prohibitive . 
  we 've got no tools to control our deficits . 
  our constitution rightfully hampers policies and higher eu courts will stand by it . 
  it 's an impossible mess . 
  today i read a story in a paper about a theoretical mandatory evacuation of our country and the downright selling of it . 
  for the saudis , chinese or whatever . 
  evicting and disbanding an entire people into the world . 
  like we 're the new jews . 
  and the portuguese being welcomed as 3rd class citizens ripe for exploitation in their new countries . 
  this is the stuff of nightmares . 
  i prefer super bock but sagres is nicer for continuous drinking . 
  guess the stagnating waters of this foul european swamp will keep still . 
  i ca n't even imagine what more austerity means . 
  short of building a giant meat grinder and using the younger and former middle classes as knackwurst . 
  yeah and harass minorities or something . 
  that one was also a huge hit over here . 
  it probably parket itself in the charts for more than a year . 
  reminds of `` gim me gim me gim me '' from abba . 
  the whole watching tv at night and feeling horny . 
  you guys have a serious advantage over the rest of us . 
  that also means that , if obama could go for a third mandate , he 'd win . 
  i 'm beginning to believe the people want to live under fascist rule . 
  probably because they do n't want to decide things or assume responsibility for their choices and actions . 
  they want nothing to do with it and delegate responsibilities elsewhere . 
  a lot of talk goes into saying we have no great leaders today , but the sad truth is that we do n't have a people worthy of them .

  it is much the same here , though i 've found we can understand you guys better than the other way around . 
  could simply be a linguistics quirk - there is such a thing as one-way intelligibility . 
  i wish i had formal training , though - my high school only offered french and german as third languages , and my french is long gone . 
  it would have been useful to properly report that my rental car got its tires slashed in le\u00f3n , instead of leading the cops to thing it got stolen ... 
  and we got some japanese culture on top of it !, 
  i 'm guilty of it too . 
  [ i thought that was no longer the case ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m5x8czd.png ), 
  well , we just need to switch to democra - wait , shit . 
  let 's start not leading them as much th - wait , shit , wrong film . 
  damn . 
  sorry for ruining your evening ... 
  [ a local example from last year ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvezwvoli1c ) . 
  kurdish owner fending off against an early morning `` munchies raid '' . 
  i do n't think that many people disagree . 
  we just wish his policies came from a bit further up his body . 
  let 's not forget france is engaged in syria and iraq . 
  an effort i absolutely support , however , but i simply do n't understand how the concept of `` you bomb , you take refugees '' is n't accepted , or even talked about . 
  are demographics a significant issue in france ? 
  seems strange , considering it 's the only country in europe which * does n't * have a threateningly low fertility rate . 
   this i agree with but the left would immediately call that racist and raise hell . 
  that said there are programs that are trying to deal with that . 
  i do n't think anyones does n't recognize this as an issue . 
  the rift lies between those see islam as a whole as a cancer and a security threat , and those who do n't . 
  if anything , those who do n't ( of which i 'm one ) are the first to recognize radicalisation as an issue , as the true cause of terrorism . 
  can not possibly recommend capit\u00e3es de abril enough . 
  and particularly on topic , it 's a portuguese-french-italian collaboration . 
  i dunno about republicans as a whole , but mccain for one sure is n't gon na take his crap . 
  it probably has , but not here . 
  let 's just assume the best for today , send this shitty year off in a good way . 
  the use of `` cuck '' as a political insult is one of the most absurd things i could ever fathom . 
  it says something about their confidence as men ( or in their wives ) if they think that 's what happens when non-caucasians are around . 
   to be fair , the labels ` far-right ' , ` nazi ' and ` fascist ' are thrown around like shit in a monkey enclosure . 
  truth is i 've far more often seen those labels used in quotes along these lines than actually being thrown at people . 
  goodwin-baiting , if you will . 
  i 've no doubt such people are out there , but that surely does n't seem the current trend . 
  an ardent democrat who gave his all against internal and external forces , in an age such a thing was n't even fathomed in the middle east . 
  what i would n't give for a couple more like him . 
  an american i discussed with before ghaddafi 's demise said , in plain words , that the west should have supported him because the suppression of any radicals in libya was more than worth the suppression of the rest of the libyan population . 
  and if anything , this sort of sentiments has only increased . 
  the apology of tyrants is nothing if not disgusting . 
  we must defend our interests , but not at the cost of subjugating entire countries under an useful idiot 's will . 
  no , it would just make it less publicized . 
  `` disappearances '' do n't make the headlines . 
  ladies and gentlemen , i present to you the 16th century . 
  eritrea and gambia in the top 3 ? 
  they 're relatively small countries , particularly the gambia at 1.8 m - that 's a very high per capita number . 
  eritrea is n't so much of a surprise though , being almost the north korea of africa , but it says something about the conditions in those countries . 
  does n't help there 's about 20 empty cubicles at the office . 
  there 's a not-so-small part of me screaming bloody rampage every time i see one of the new `` delta `` s. 
  no , rather the lack of it is the noose by which we hang others because they displease us . 
  or * hanged * , rather , in the west 's case . 
  slightly . 
  the british museum is basically an active crime scene . 
   in their eyes poland is one of the last bastion of european culture free of liberal propaganda . 
  what 's strange here is the forces that have for centuries either besieged or occupied poland were authoritarian , rather than liberal . 
  the nationalism is more than understandable , but it 's strange it 'll lean that way . 
  the albanian case got me thinking . 
  is escaping from blood feuds a valid reason for asylum ? 
  i believe so , because clearly they happen , but would a european host country acknowledge the incompetence of another european country to stop it ? 
  signed , russia , germany and austria about poland , circa the 18th century . 
  ukraine : `` it 's all about u '' . 
  first , terrible . 
  second , goddamnit , now i have that terrible korean air commercial stuck in my head . 
  everyone has inner demons . 
  we 've just been fighting them better for the last 50 years than anyone else . 
  we just got ta keep on it . 
  though i absolutely should not at this point , i am still taken aback by the sheer , unbridled , immeasurable hubris of the israeli institutions on this matter . 
  the word of the world * fucking matters * . 
  the secret services are n't the problem at this point . 
  despite the initial mayhem and the legitimate constraints they are ( and should be ) subjected to , they caught up . 
  the vast majority of terror attacks and foiled plots as of late has come from individuals that were previously identified and tracked . 
  it 's the thing that infuriates me the most about the entire crisis . 
  we * are * being able to sort them out , to separate the wheat from the chaff . 
  it 's what everyone on every side ever wanted - left and right , europeans and refugees . 
  but our judiciary is simply utterly unable to act upon that information provided . 
  and so radicalized islamists roam free , europeans die , and refugees suffer . 
  acting upon that information alone would solve the vast majority of this crisis . 
  i only hope it does n't take any more bodies for that . 
  is this like the portuguese version of hostel ? 
  the man 's an educational genius . 
  he just doubled the average number of languages spoken by moldavians overnight !, 
  you could easily extend that argument to every other international language , really . 
  so long as the divergence is small enough to be considered the same language , just as original name is only retained for historical reasons , they 'd really only be changed for nationalistic ones . 
  otherwise , i could just say i speak latin . 
  a very late vulgar latin . 
  a good effort . 
  i will not comment on the results or methodology as i lack the knowledge to critique them , but any unbiased effort towards clarification is to be commended . 
  i can only hope that on the medium-long term , the current political situation can shake its seemingly increasing numbness to statistical analysis , at least at a macro scale - and efforts like yours will , in fact , matter , and stand above personal opinions and micro scale data or events . 
  [ they 've got a few more things to block , too ] ( https://twitter.com/bjoernstritzel/status/812725734938734592 ) ... 
  the eu already has an excellent bureau doing the same work for false eu-related news . 
  sadly , their work is completely ignored and they end up ultimately being useless . 
  the same fate 's likely to befall this effort . 
  never heard anything of the such . 
  and i 'll even add that as much i would have liked to see bin laden tried for his crimes , it 's better that he was just killed instead , as the us are completely incapable of bringing terrorists to trial . 
  they just flashed a green flag at the door . 
  that 's definitely the case . 
  i mean , what else were you doing other than comparing war to terrorism ? 
  or characteristics of them , at least . 
  not ideologically , but there 's no shortage of those who think helping to remove him was a mistake - ignoring exactly who they 're talking about . 
  we will not break .

   no wind speak for yourself , aveiro is always windy . 
  hey man , it 's 20\u00bac outside ... 
  i have to wear long sleeves , this counts as cold . 
  still absent here in portugal , i hope it stays that way . 
  the spanish like to pretend they do n't understand portuguese . 
  or at least it 's a stereotype . 
  the basque i guess . 
  we love 'em anyway though . 
   europe has always been a melting pot of different nations/cultures . 
  we have ? 
  i mean . 
  even cultures as similar as the portuguese and the castilians have had borders for ages . 
  and just to be clear right . 
  portuguese / castilian culture diverged from a common ancestor , it certainly did not meld as a ` melting pot ' would imply . 
   reform the whole eu just for italy considering that portugal also wants to leave the euro , maybe not just for italy . 
  also it might lead to a development of a european military industry complex that could actually create jobs . 
  they could sell this fairly well but i do n't think they 'll want to put these new factories in countries that need jobs . 
   lets say belgium or portugal man , we 're always the example for when someone does n't identify with [ european country on the outskirts of the union ] . 
  wo n't someone please say spain for once ? 
  your kids are portuguese citizens by default by virtue of having a portuguese parent . 
  also if i recall correctly portugal has a treaty in place with england to facilitate migration of brits into the country . 
  sure . 
  islam is not the sole shitty ideology . 
  does that make it a good ideology or does it remain a shitty one ? 
  seems rather mad to me . 
  complaints over estimated noise can delay or outright halt development ? 
   i can see how portugal can be better than germany . 
  best country on earth if you make a decent living . 
  the economy is just ... not lending itself to let many of its natives reach that point . 
  reality is that leaving the euro would cause much more immediate damage were portugal to be the one pulling the lever first . 
  the portuguese are not blinded by affection towards the eu , it 's just a matter of practicality . 
  also plenty would rather reform the euro than leave it . 
   because religion is part of culture alright . 
  what part of german culture has anything to do with islam ? 
  see down here in the south , islam is a pretty significant part of it even if it 's our national identity being built around fighting it but i do n't see how it 's relevant in germany . 
  does n't make it acceptable . 
  surely this is something the eu should be regulating against ? 
  i 'm all for further cooperation with spain , an actual unification of countries i 'm not so keen on . 
  i 'm so triggered right now . 
  they can pry my c 's out of my cold dead hands . 
   tortilla de patata would be the best dish for the entire country . 
  made it today since i 've never had it . 
  this dish is actually great considering how simple it is . 
  for reference , i only used onions , potatoes , parsley and eggs . 
  i too play dota . 
  meh , it 's only the unimportant southerners , who cares . 
  considering that [ bacalhau com natas ] ( http://asminhasreceitas.com/sites/default/files/artigos/receitas-infaliveis-bacalhau-natas-1.jpg ) , [ bacalhau \u00e0 gomes de s\u00e1 ] ( http://gastronomiaefotografia.com.br/br/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/110.jpg ) , [ bacalhau \u00e0 br\u00e1s ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/bacalhau_a_bras.jpg ) , [ past\u00e9is de bacalhau ] ( http://5.fotos.web.sapo.io/i/o9d1471ae/18540556_9mzub.jpeg ) and [ bacalhau com batata a murro ] ( http://sm2.imgs.sapo.pt/mb/2/e/7ef6cd5f4825eae15da8214a964ae31e14b7c7.jpg ) all taste differently , no i guess we do n't . 
  would 've gone with carne de porco \u00e0 alentajana myself . 
  hate speech nowadays is the most ill-defined thing ever . 
  there are a lot of those pairings in europe . 
  to be honest with you friend , all spanish women have a great accent to my ears . 
  does n't it ring rather hollow when it ignores the fact that the portuguese luxembourgers are 16 % of the country 's population , portuguese is spoken twice as much as german ( 2.3 % to 1.1 % ) but german remains an official language ? 
  you know , ca n't we at least take solace that people are responding to this by voting rather than burning and killing ? 
  correlation is not causation . 
  there might have been increases in racist / xenophobic incident following brexit but this does not necessarily means it 's caused by brexit . 
  jesus man , are you okay ? 
  if i had to guess the eu will just negotiate the cooperation they want anyway and only make it into law the day after the uk leaves . 
  probably wrecked portuguese-french relations for a good 4 years . 
  still worth it . 
  what 's so wrong about sending mussolini 's daughter to be a representative in the eu parliament ? 
  do the sins of the father matter for the daughter ? 
  they 're not trade agreements governing standards , tariffs and so on . 
  those fall under eu law as i understand . 
  they 're bilateral investment agreements with knowledge trades and benefits for nationals of the other country . 
  for instance , ( if i recall correctly ) brazil has a policy on promoting brazilians over people of any other nationality , with a small caveat that portuguese people are exempt from this and should be treated as a brazilian would . 
  there are already several hundred portuguese companies with connections and dealings in brazil and vice-versa which undoubtedly make it easier to make way for further investments in those markets . 
  i was n't referring to a free trade agreement , merely that some trade treaties are already in place between portugal and brazil . 
  unsure about spain but portugal already has established trade and migration treaties with brazil . 
  does n't seem outlandish to me to assume spain has similar deals with their former colonies . 
  do they want to correct the record ? 
  some people get really offended by a historical piece of cloth , it 's nuts . 
  crossing the border south from galicia means you dial the clock back an hour . 
  i reiterate . 
  south . 
  i resent this poll for making me say that spain is the best at a lot of things . 
  ( except women , which are clearly french , and economic prosperity ), 
  let 's be honest with ourselves . 
  italy is too good for us . 
  we 'd be dancing with spain . 
  portugal 's right there with her . 
  if you want proper food you got ta head to the north , those southerners have n't even learned what seasoning and salt are . 
   was benevolent depends on what you 're focusing on . 
  conditions on colonial industries like sugar were awful and far worse than colonial industries in english and french ones . 
  that said , part of that has to do with the product being made itself . 
  meh , england and portugal got along somehow . 
  oh you wound me . 
  our nations have been allies for six centuries but this does n't warrant being called a close tie uh ? 
  you 're right , best we light ourselves on fire to warm our neighbours . 
  i think he 's saying that to sunnis , the shia would be the apostates . 
  ... that ca n't be real . 
  can it ? 
  i think the one asturian food i can even name is the fabada ( ? ) . 
  i 'm a fan of it even if barely ever cook it . 
  just googled tartiflette , it looks like a dish you 'd eat in a cold winter night by the fire . 
  i 'm gon na have to try to make it in december . 
  just stay on your side of the border this time spaniard . 
  i 'll have you know i know an ugly woman baker with a big shovel . 
  you could 've just said anywhere in portugal that is n't serra da estrela . 
  they tried several times and lost every time .

  you sound a lot like nigel farage . 
  you could have said just that without using hiv as an argument . . how do hiv rates in portugal relate to that ? 
  let 's wait for brexit ( if eventually it does happen ) and see the result . 
  if the netherlands would leave the eu unilaterally everything around would be blocked for trade or have new huge limitations . 
  there are no irreplaceable ports . 
  no country in the eu is more needed than what it needs eu , not even germany . 
  of course if the all thing collapses it 's a different story , but netherlands alone outside the eu would be doomed and in urgent need of a new economic model . 
  hiv rates in portugal are on stable levels for decades ( due to treatments that keep infected people alive ) , and the levels were high decades ago in big part due to big influxes of western african migrants . 
  that said , if you want to criticize someone for insulting a country you should keep the level up , not lower it . 
  it 's easy to insult all around . 
   trade will keep on going as it did . 
  between holland and the dutch antilles you mean ? 
  sounds like a spoiled sultan bored with his slaves ... 
  sounds realistic , maybe you could transform the port of rotterdam into a beach resort to rival with spain , as the port itself would n't be of much use anymore ... 
  huge mighty belgian mocking luxembourg for being small ... seriously . 
  luxembourg is also not a city-state , you 're dutch you should know that . 
  dutch tourists love northern luxembourg campsites but rarely venture in the city ... 
  cool . 
  i admit to be ignorant on the matter , the only thing i ever noticed concerning sisterhood on my town was a street with a weird german name ( the sister town ) ... and just verified that the german town has a street with a weird portuguese name . 
  thought that was as far as it went . . 
  this is the funniest one :  left alone in the vip suite as barroso met with the singaporean prime minister in another suite , i thought there was no point in writing yet another draft of the speech . 
  so i decided instead to a take a bath in barroso 's private bathroom , the only one available , to refresh after the 12-hour flight from europe . 
  there was just one problem : after i was done , the bathtub refused to drain . 
   i desperately called in hotel staff , trying to express in the strongest possible terms that the water had to leave the bathtub . 
  we failed , and barroso returned to a tub full of soapy bathwater . 
  til that those sister-cities agreements are actually worth of something for their residents . . wow . 
  ps : another particularity of the angolan soaps is that a big part of their casting is actually made of portuguese black actors , so the accent is not so coherent on the scenes ... ( although the difference of accent from luanda to lisbon is not so big it 's still noticeable ) :p edit : [ example , the mum of the scene speaks with a lisbon accent to her children that clearly have an angolan accent ] ( https://youtu.be/h-8os4iby6i?t=16m50s ) . 
   except deutschland 83 go watch it i watched that one , but it 's not really a soap though . 
  when it comes to crime series northern european tv is very very good . 
  but everyday soaps , nope . 
  there were already a few passing on portuguese tv , but they 're very unrealistic , only show the nice side of luanda elite life . . 
  there was even [ a co-production between the portuguese and angolan tvs about the lives of aviation crews between lisbon and luanda ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec3ixza9-js ) . 
  but the acting and production is still very far from brazilian quality , that often can rival with the best hbo american stuff . 
  the only problem is that the soap format is too long , too many episodes . . edit : but just found out that there were already [ 2 angolan soaps nominated for the best telenovela emmy award ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_emmy_award_for_best_telenovela ) , wow . 
  this is really nothing , the guy is a total crook and he will still have full access to brussels , the reason why he was hired , to lobby in brussels , it 's indifferent if he has to remove his belt or not first . . 
  i have a croat colleague of 30 something and she 's a huge fan , she even watches them on turkish tv , although she ca n't really follow the language . . 
  do n't think so as they dub them . 
  ahahah i remember this one , seems so strange nowadays , so brutal and basic at the same time . 
  i think there were some better ones in the 90s . 
  but could only find [ this one on youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uthy9bo-aqq ) that is even more brutal lol, 
  `` stop naziphobia now . 
  nazism is the ideology of peace . '', 
   i do n't know if portugal has historcal link with netherland though . 
  our main link were quite a few wars in the colonies the dutch tried to take from us , occasionally with success . . 
  i was replying to a comment with a norwegian flag . 
  i guess france could also fit the atlantic axis and iceland , oh , also not in :p the atlantic axis is missing too many potencial members . . 
  fair enough . 
  but there 're testimonies saying the train was very slow at that point . 
   as the ec said , the problem is that it would make mobile services more expensive in the poorer european countries . 
  but that will only happen if these companies activelly try to seduce foreign customers , which in itself carries lots of new costs . . 
  so i wonder if there will be so much people going for foreign contracts or this will mostly benefit people living/working between 2 countries or travelling very frequently . 
  never underestimate the power of inertia , ca n't imagine so much people saying in germany `` this is my number but you have to add the romanian international code first '' ... 
  the problem of the south axis is that these countries have probably more differences than similarities . 
  they do n't even share much land borders between them , so there 's not really much cohesion . . 
  but anyway , no impediment for a country to be a part of different subgroups . 
  i would like to see an atlantic axis as well , where pt-es-ie-no ( oh wait , you 're not in , pity ) , could also share knowledge/experiences and pressure for common issues ... 
  the train is provided with the automatic breaking system . 
  all evidences so far indicate a problem on the line itself .

  on my to go list for ages . . :p, 
  thank you for the explanation , 
  in northern portugal we have a kind of similar word , `` folerca '' . . 
  but are those caribbean islands an integral part of the netherlands ? 
  ue , schengen and all ? 
  a country could easily introduce a second official currency and keep euro as a legal currency , although not used to pay wages . 
  it 's that simple actually . 
  on the other hand in portuguese `` birra '' means a whim or tantrum ... 
  a `` polish lives matter '' would make more sense in the uk right now ... 
  that 's all we need , to transform a global crisis whose impact will affect the entire planet into a white-versus-black thing , or judging by the pictures , a white-versus-white-using-blacks-as-excuse thing . 
   being in the eu clearly has n't worked for you guys . 
  anyone with a memory of portugal pre and post-eu will disagree . 
  the euro is another matter though . . 
  considering there are several eu members which are not eurozone members , with 2 of them even with op-outs to never join ( uk and dk ) , would be absurd to imply that leaving the $ would equate to leave the eu . 
  it 's germany , so it can always get wurst . 
  that 's precisely the problem here , since the attacks any ch polemic cartoon spreads in the internet outside its context . 
  whoever read a full ch paper before does n't get offended by it . . it was always a semi-obscure paper read by a few fans that get their particular language . 
  by upset you mean when they bombed ch and later when they executed most of its staff ? 
  quite confident italians are not thaaaat upset . 
  we all hate them . 
  they 've become more common in luxembourg too , recently , at least getting more attention . 
  sometimes i wonder if all these people walking dogs through the parks are not giving a very strong contribution to that . . 
  ecological impact might be difficult to predict sometimes . 
  but also , how would you be able to eradicate them ? 
  do n't think that 's possible , same with mosquitoes . . 
  sorry about that , i should have put crimea-congo between brackets . . just thought useful to add the specific name to the title , otherwise sounds like a mysterious fever ... 
  no muslims , no terrorism , no news, 
  lol were you that poorly dressed ? 
  i 'm sure the tickets were cheaper . . 
  i 'm not sure all greens are peaches and all reds are coconuts , portuguese are not so peachy , less so than italians i 'm sure . 
  language skills , either from the expats or the nationals , must also play a big role . 
  if you speak some italian italians are easily among the most friendly people in europe , total peaches as i see it . 
  i already heard from many people who traveled there that iranians are incredibly friendly , but again be sure not to be gay :p, 
  lol that in the troika . 
  this is just promoting borders , we do n't need that ... 
  not much besides climate . 
  no strong historical ties , no linguistic , religious or cultural ties ... just that one euro cup final in 2004 i would say . 
   greece has far more in common with italy or portugal than it does with romania . 
  the map is jumbled . 
  climate yes . 
  culturally or linguistically or historical ties ?

  around here that 's called coffee flavored tea . 
  also nothing beats a 10 bar machine when the matter is to extract caffeine from coffee beans . 
  interesting ... * apanhar um pivo * ( getting a pivo ) is a somewhat but not that much common slang for getting wasted/drunk in portuguese . 
  brasilians have dedicated webpages , and even [ books ] ( http://mlb-s2-p.mlstatic.com/livro-as-melhores-piadas-do-portugus-roberto-goldkorn-13936-mlb214248809_5848-f.jpg ) to make jokes about portugal / portuguese people , from [ text ] ( http://www.piadasnet.com/piadas-de-portugues.htm ) to [ comics ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=piadas+de+portugues+tiras&amp;es_sm=93&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=aczbu-_okke47aadhygyba&amp;ved=0cb0qsaq&amp;biw=1007&amp;bih=931 ) to [ videos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cigt4zhtacy ) . 
  they are known as `` piadas de portugues '' so imagine the circlejerk when portugal lost 4-0 to germany , yet karma is a bitch . 
   a quick one : - why do portuguese have moustaches ? 
  - to look like their mothers . 
  ----- - how many portuguese jokes do exist ? 
  - two , all the others are facts .

  that 's cheaper than `` no brand '',

  olive oil , sunflower oil , whale oil . .

  not classy as the french version : bigger version are called : [ `` caracoletas '' ] ( http://c3.quickcachr.fotos.sapo.pt/i/b340431a6/13565121_zfd48.jpeg ) smaller version are called : [ `` caracois '' ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7ous_g_1ub8/t6q6t7524ni/aaaaaaaad_q/p0rukqoufk0/s1600/caracois%2bportuguesa.jpg ) they 're the perfect company for a cold beer in a hot summer day . 
  also , there are dozens of other foods made of entrails or less appealing parts , but that is somewhat common all across europe . . 
  i think that only applies for people that never had worked , payed taxes in portugal . 
  i 'm not sure about that , there must be some more recent changes . 
  you should change the description of your flair to : * portugal special administrative region of the people 's republic of china *,

  but take note if they are caught by picky police , they 're in trouble . 
  especially if they get the fiscal police . 
  and , yes !, 
  this is just part of the law . . and yes !, 
  the law is very stupid and picky . 
  also , a legalized mk4 supra in portugal is more like 30k ~ 40k . 
  the taxes on a car like that , are huge too .

  that was what i had to learn , giving me 67 names . 
  although at least my teacher did n't enforced much the municipalities , giving on a total of around 50 names . 
  note : it can escalate quick if you consider that alone the municipally in portugal with more parishes has 89 of them . 
  but i do n't think that they have to know all 89 of them , probably just the closest ones . 
  so , we have the same font and also the same color scheme .

  thank you , for coming up with the topic , since i do n't know many european films , especially after 2000 . 
  the list is starting to look great . 
  same here . 
  ... and portugal , spain , germany , macedonia , sweden , italy , denmark , finland and the uk and the list goes on ... 
  still have alleged secret cia prisons with little investigation . 
  i need more details , but let me warn you that it is usually illegal to camp outside specific areas , * specially * near lakes and beaches , but there are a lot of campsites near beaches and lakes all over europe , where you could book for one night or two easily . 
   our supermarkets have actually become quite cheap ( ofc . 
  compared with average wage ) your supermarkets * are * quite cheap , you do n't even need to compare it with the average wage . 
  the last time i was there , the only thing that i found to be more or less expensive in the supermarkets was fresh fruit . 
  same for finns, 
  i was trying to say that 's nothing new and is `` somewhat normal '' , it can happen . 
  some recorded dates for snow ( in lisbon ) : 1806 ; 1811 ; 1814 ; 1815 ; 1837 ; 1933 ; 1945 ; 1954 ; 1956 ; 1971 ; 2007 . 
  in some of this dates it lasted for days , but the usual is just some traces , melting in a couple of hours . 
  there are some reports in other dates like 1993 , but it instantly melted reaching the ground . 
  i would compare it with tornadoes in europe , they exist , usually weak , every now and then one stronger , people act surprised like is something new , then they forget about them again . 
  ice pellets . 
  not actually hail .

  i can tell you stories about the father of one of my best friends that saved money for six months to buy a wallet and then had no money to put in the wallet ( and had no money for shoes ) , or the story of the cleaning lady that helps my mother who , when growing up had a quarter of a sardine with a slice of bread as dinner after working in the fields for the entire day . 
  & nbsp ; so yes , after portugal became a democracy we increased public spending and had budget deficits . 
  we had to build a whole country from almost nothing ( especially after the initial convulsions after the revolution that crushed the few industrial bright spots of portugal ) and we still carry the burden of that dictatorship in the education level of our older population . 
  also , the fiscal rules in the eu were established much later than portugal and spain entrance into the eu and at the beginning the priority was in modernizing the southern countries not in us controlling our finances . 
  because at the time , european leaders had this silly notion that progress was defined not by hard economic numbers but by the education level , health and economic well-being of their populations . 
  & nbsp ; so yeah , we did n't prioritize controlling our public spending . 
  we prioritized giving healthcare access to the entire population , establishing vaccination plans , building schools , improving our communication networks , building energy infrastructure , etc , etc. 
  priorities i know . 
  i guess we should 've been `` fiscally responsible '' instead of decreasing our infant mortality rate from african levels to one of the best in the world . 
  & nbsp ; lets compare that to estonia : you guys came from a communist dictatorship with free access to healthcare , education . 
  you did n't have to invest in plenty of things that portugal had to invest in . 
  you are surrounded by plenty of neighbors , and economically strong neighbors . 
  there are plenty of reasons why you have your beliefs and why things in southern european countries worked differently . 
  who do we have ? 
  spain , which suffered from the exact same problems as we did . 
  & nbsp ; i think you are showing flawed reasoning because you assume that common debt will be equal to relaxed rules and unbalanced budgets . 
  that 's not what i 'm saying at all and rules must be designed that make everyone a bit pissed off ( common debt , but assurances about controlled spending , for example ) . 
  germany needs to take into consideration the position of other countries as well . 
  we 've been taking into consideration and following germany 's bidding for the past few years . 
  & nbsp ; i do have a pretty strong clue about germany 's position . 
  my family suffered a lot finantially because of germany 's position , as well as plenty of innocent people in portugal . 
  & nbsp ; as for your analogy of comparing certain countries to alcoholics i 'm not even going to reply . 
  it makes it crystal clear what your prejudice is . 
  good . 
  and the southern countries wo n't accept more austerity pushed through germany , the fiscal tax haven netherlands and the nordic countries . 
  & nbsp ; lets break up the eu in half then and lets see how those `` virtuous '' northern countries will do without access to the 170 million people of spain , france and italy . 
  sorry if i sounded too harsh . 
  i had a knee jerk reaction and did n't have much time to post a long reply outlining my reasoning . 
  & nbsp ; referendums have a tendency of blowing up in the country 's faces . 
  you are making a wrong assumption ( based on inaccurate stereotypes ) that other countries are just waiting for a more tight union to completely relax on budget deficit and public debt targets which is blatantly innacurate . 
  & nbsp ; the reason for the increase in budget deficits was the subprime crisis which hit europe very hard and then greece . 
  go research and you will see that portugal and spains budget deficits were being controlled before that and that the public debt was much lower ( spain had already achieved the targets even ) . 
  & nbsp ; if you 're going to have referendums everywhere then the eurozone will break up anyway because people do n't think that voting in european matters has direct consequences for their life so they tend to use the chance to vote in those elections as protest votes against their national governments . 
  just edited my comment because i posted it accidentally before finishing it , my estonian bro . 
   & nbsp ; i understand your position , but i am not saying that you would have to burden the debt of other countries . 
  the debt already created should be paid solely by each country , however new debt would be common to all . 
  and you would n't have much to suffer from cmmon debt because the benefits of being in a 340 million monetary union would vastly outweigh that . 
  & nbsp ; just look at how small states in the us prosper even though they have high debt . 
  there should be rules to try and prevent some spending tresholds to be surpassed , however many factors need to be taken into account carefully . 
  the eurozone is facing several problems and everyone will have to swallow a bitter pill to make things work . 
  not `` everyone '' ignores it . 
  go check again the public deficits of the eurozone countries please . 
  it 's very hard to stick to those rules in the midst of one of the biggest finantial crisis in history , as for the 60 % public debt rule , the definition of what was public debt changed a few years ago even !, 
  & nbsp ; for example , the rules for what was coutned as public debt changed in 2014 and those rule changes made the portuguese public debt shoot up 10 % ( http://www.jornaldenegocios.pt/economia/financas-publicas/detalhe/divida_publico_aumentou_cinco_mil_milhoes_de_euros_com_inclusao_de_cp_carris_e_stcp ) . 
  & nbsp ; so you have rules changing all the time and towards a more draconian direction . 
  why ??? 
  and did you ever thought to ask why that 3 % budget deficit should be untouchable or the 60 % public debt ? 
  or why the ecb should only take into account the inflation rate being around 2 % to adjust interest rates ? 
  or why should have to be carrying a public debt burden that has been saddled with losses from private banks as well ? 
  that 's bullshit . 
  so some things can and should be negotiated . 
  & nbsp ; these are rules that need to be seriously discussed and i do n't believe that germany will force an exit from europe . 
  i see it as much more likely for italy to leave even if these changes start to be discussed . 
  & nbsp ; i agree that budget deficits must be prevented whenever possible but this notion that the populations of some countries are lazy bastards and that 's the reason for all the problems needs to stop because it ca n't be further from the truth . 
  ok , that 's your prerogative . 
  leave the eu , the access to the common market and welcome the big bear from the east . 
  i agree , but to make europe resilient then you need to prevent the markets from exploiting differences between the member states . 
  this can only be achieved by having a common fiscal policy . 
  and the germans should understand the side of every other country in the eurozone . 
  the countries already agreed upon reducing their debt level and have surpluses or minimal deficits ( or are strongly decreasing their deficits . 
  the germans wo n't pull out of the eurozone because they 're the main beneficiaries from it and quite frankly , cdu just needs to tone down on their obssession and rethoric for the population to accept that . 
  more than 35 % do n't mind already ( the spd and green voters mostly ) . 
  this ca n't be introduced slowly because this past year and a half has shown that action needs to be taken swiftly and now instead of delaying things . 
  we call upon putin to stop europhobia and instead work towards pragmatic and mutually beneficial ties . 
  macron said that he wanted the current public debts to remain for each country and issue common debt exclusively for the future . 
  that seems like a reasonable compromise . 
  either way , germany will have to budge because not only france but italy and spain want significant changes in the eurozone . 
  it 's not all americans . 
  i can tell you that it is a small minority of americans that thinks like this , even in the gop this is not a widely accepted idea . 
  it 's just in the lunatic right-wing subreddits and corners of the internet . 
  the nerve of this guy . 
  it 's a humouristic article . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
   how are the negotiations for your new government going by the way ? 
  no news in the subreddit about that , would love to know how 's that going . 
  sorry , i disagree on several points you make . 
  first , by debating the populists it stops the populists because when they are forced to expand on their soundbytes to actual policy proposals you see them for what they are . 
  they do n't have a real government program and it shows . 
  & nbsp ; second , in the specific portuguese case , the left-wing parties never manage to surpass more than 10-12 % of the votes . 
  they 've never been parties with a real chance to get into power , but protest parties that try to achieve smaller things and represent certain smaller interests . 
  & nbsp ; third , to me it is outrageous to compare be and pcp to the fn or right-wing populists . 
  be actually has become more moderate and they actually have railed against some big economic scandals and gained a lot of clout because of that . 
  pcp became a party for worker 's unions . 
  and they 've demonstrated in this past year and a half that they can be pragmatic when necessity arises . 
  the existence of these two parties prevents the rise of real extreme-right wing parties in portugal . 
  it 's well known why these people are voting the way they are . 
  look at the huge unemployment numbers in so many countries and specifically the youth unemployment numbers . 
  & nbsp ; on the one hand we have the best educated generations coming into the work market being explored and shutdown of the work force . 
  then older , less educated people that are seeing their jobs taken and they are actively discriminated against because of their age and lower education . 
  & nbsp ; but the concerns of these people are being heard . 
  however , many do n't care because they 're angry as well and they 'll vote out of spite . 
  furthermore , there 's also people voting because they are racists , even if you do n't think so . 
  and with those , you ca n't argue , just simply call them for what they are . 
  do n't assume that everyone voting for fn or wilders can be argued with because they have a core 10 % -15 % which are truly racists . 
  however , these alt-right/neo-fascists/whatever you want to call them are very cleverly disguising their ideology with traditional left-wing economic proposals to obfuscate many people that would n't consider them otherwise . 
  & nbsp ; i think macron had the correct approach when he chose to debate with le pen and confront her ideas head-on . 
  he made clear the lack of ideas and policy of the fn by confronting her . 
  you defeat these populists by confronting them and forcing them to elaborate on their soundbytes . 
  & nbsp ; as for wilders he gained a few seats , but he still has less than what he had a few years ago . 
  considering that he won 66 % to 34 % i would call that a `` landslide '' .

  they are screwed . 
  yes , please . 
  since we relinquish our ~ ~ rightfully ours ~ ~ colonies we are now a peaceful nation , and thus do n't have the joy that only a good war brings .

  hahaha . 
  how property is transferred is not related to the type of code you have . 
  even countries that adopt the same type of code have different systems of how property is transferred . 
  for example , portugal , despite having a bgb type code does n't have the title and modus system that germany and austria have . 
  this has more to do with the regional/family of law you are in than the type of code you adopt . 
  i ca n't speak for the scandinavians ones , but , in a short answer , the difference between the roman-germanic influenced codes and the napoleonics is the division in which the codes are structured . 
  the germanic ones follow the pandectist school of the late 19th century , which put emphasis in the division of the subjects rather than have a sole chapter for the actions ( means of protection or enforcement of rights ) . 
  this is why this type of civil codes follow this structure ( general part , obligations law , property law , family law and successions law ) . 
  the `` actions '' for are included in each chapter and vary from one another , instead of being placed in a separate chapter like with happens in the napoleonic code . 
  edit : correction of an error . 
  it is n't because of this . 
  our first civil code ( 1867 or the code of seabra ) was heavily inspired by the french code of 1804 . 
  however , our legal scholars from the 1920 's ( especially the coimbra law school , from whom the major people responsible for the project came from [ adriano vaz serra and jo\u00e3o antunes varela ] ) onwards viewed the pandectist structure of a code to be the best in terms of legal technique . 
  this is why the present civil code of 1966 adopted the so-called roman-germanic division of 5 books , dividing between the general part , obligations law , property law , family law and successions law . 
  germany invaded the ussr , not the other way around,

  foreign beer in portugal is hard to find .

  the evidence actually did n't point out for that to happen . 
  the serbian government did n't had a proxy state to do their dirt for them like in bosnia and in 99 the bosnian genocide was well know and the international community had put milo\u0161evi\u0107 ' government in high alert . 
  of course , if nato did n't intervene a guerrilha war was likely and serbia may only give you de facto control many years after , so i understand why you view this in a positive light . 
  but what nato did was a illegal war to make a illegal secession of state and bombed and killing thousand of civilians . 
  from then on we knew that the us would use any pretext to attack any country that they had an interest on . 
  not longer after they invade iraq on some bogus claims and after it , it was lybia , paquistan , syria , yemen , however . 
  the russians saw this for example , as the general public stop seeing the us as a friendly nation after the collapse of ussr and elected putin . 
  i was n't a kid . 
  and i did n't claim there was no war or there was no refugees or even war crimes . 
  what did n't happen was genocide like it was claimed by nato to justify their intervention . 
  but still this nonsense is still spread today . 
  i remember seeing a couple of documentaries back in the day and it came in some newspapers . 
  did a quick google search and did n't find a mainstream media article , but found this , for example . 
  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/324403.stm do n't have time to make a proper search , but i 'm sure you can found it out there . 
  even if those crimes were committed , the reports that were the basis of nato 's intervention were proven to be false . 
  and not only that , but the governments of at least the us , uk and germany had direct knowledge that those reports were false , and most likely participated in the making of those reports . 
  nato 's intervention in kosovo were a war crime . 
  we just do n't talk about it because it does n't suit our interests . 
   serbs tried to ethnically cleanse albanians in kosovo actually , they did n't . 
  they had some incidents with kosovo 's pro-independence 's militias and nato decide to bomb belgrade and other towns to force a withdrawal of serbian military and police from kosovo . 
  those reports of suppose ethnically cleansing that surface by german news outlets have been proven to be false . 
  nato had zero legitimacy to intervene in kosovo . 
   land of snakes this is the only one that it 's true to me . 
  hehehe,

  and even if it 's not , you do n't need to act like a smartass . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/sociedade/videos/saiba-de-onde-vem-a-tradicao-da-arvore-de-natal ) it comes from the 2nd reign of marie ii ( 1834-1853 ) , brought by her german consort ferdinand ii . 
  but i think until the 50 's was n't usual in portugal . 
  probably the biggest influence was the proliferation of american mass culture by movies , etc. 
   mind you , we only eat it not stick it on things speak for yourself ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  yes , but that ruins the joke , man . 
  for a second i thought you were going skiing in the low countries . 
  that would be 5 seconds tops until you reach the end of the down hill . 
  for a period of time , yes it did .

  what i see is a bunch of neo liberal bullshit , that do n't learn even after overwhelming evidence that the way they are following is not working . 
  i see countries using others or emigrants as scapegoats for its problems , i see politics using vindictive measures against small countries as a political tool . 
  you see i 'm pro eu , but not this thing it became . 
  and since it 's not changing and i his going off a cliff this way , maybe we are better off to leave , be as hard as it has to be . 
  i was like you once , believing the eu could do no wrong and was working for the better of all contries , but that is bullshit . 
  i just ca n't see how can anyone believe that bullshit anymore , they even said that france is france so they do n't need to worry about this , last month so do n't tell me they are doing this for our own good and that they treat all the same . 
  completely besides the point , either enforce the rules for all , or get ride of them ( i favor the second , this was stupid from the beginning ) . 
  now they are just using this to bully small contries . 
  we do n't want charity , we want equal treatment . 
  specialy since the eu was the one making the measures here that made us pass the budget . 
  you fuck off , this is still an equal union not an imperialist project , like some people want and are working to make . 
  yes it is , because when the rules are only used to bully small contries they are no rules , just instruments of control . 
  if you think romania will fare better you are crazy . 
  portugal was also in an amazing place in the 90s within the eu , the future was bright and so on . 
  you are in that spot now , but you will crash hard , if the eu continues this path . 
  you will not believe me , but you will in 10 years or less . 
  make france follow the rules instead of a country that did n't follow the rules after beeing ruled economicaly by the same eu and fmi . 
  if this is n't the proff the things they defend do n't work ( like austerity ) , i do n't know what is, 
  fixed a bit , sorry i 'm just beyond mad and writing on a phone . 
  but basically almost every country has failed this goal is the past , specially france , the country that did it the most ( even this year ) , but even germany had done that . 
  to join this bullshit , we are coming out of 3 years that the eu and fmi basically ruled the country in economic matters ( the years that this fine is about ) . 
  so after doing what we were told by them , we get fined by them , when the same people told us that they won fine france , because it 's france . 
  if you still think this is fair , i do n't know what to say . 
  because every other country that did n't follow the rules did n't even got a flap . 
  and we broke the budget rules because we followed all the things the eu told us to do , so much that we were the good student . 
  fuck this eu , they do n't learn , end this farce, 
  it 's bullying , makes no sense we ca n't accept this , every other contry gets a pass but the country that took every measure they wanted they fuck over . 
  i was always promoted eu but today i say fuck the eu , if it 's like this let 's leave . 
  other contries break the rules , and nothing happens , we do after following everything that we were told , and they fuck us over . 
  fuck you , you did n't learn anything from british exit . 
  this seems also pretty obvious to also discredit the left wing government in portugal ( for something the previous government that the eu loved did at their command ) and condition the formation of the spanish government , this people running the eu are so stupid they are like the caricatures the british made about them . 
  why should i , i choose to leave the sub a long time ago because of that , and the lack of solidarity with in europe from the so called europhile here , but kept looking more a more like a right wing paradise . 
  i came here today to get some articles from brexit , but just made me feel more sad and mad with the probable future of the continent . 
  i only brought the topic because it show `` 2 pesos and 2 medidas '' from spanish government , i myself more than happy to let that issue go in name of good relations . 
  i love going to spain and have nothing against it , but i do n't like the right wing in madrid , all that franco legacy stuff , not letting the people choose there future ( anti-democratic ) , hypocrisy and politic usage of gibraltar , etc. 
  so when parent said he wants us to join spain , i said no thanks , or i 'm suppose to say thanks and kiss the king hand ? 
  no thanks , i can be in favor of an european federation , but beeing subject to madrid , hell no, 
  emigrants obviously , there is always some one to blame , for people like this . 
  i never said i wanted oliven\u00e7a back , quite the contrary , but i was just pointing out that spanish government , is highly hypocrite , when talking about gibraltar , ceuta menila and oliven\u00e7a . 
  seems strange that someone with catalunya flair doesnt see that , given the fact they wo n't let you decide your future . 
  greece at least has good reasons to leave , but they did n't . 
  you guys not so much . 
  when you will let your people decide their future , i 'll think otherwise, 
  responses in this sub about this scares me about europe . 
  thanks for saying things with reason . 
  britain wanted them to get in, 
  i 'm pro europe , but i 'd they approve sanctions , that they did n't gave to france in the same circumstances , i 'll more than support blocking all eu deals . 
  but i 'm not defending its inclusion back , i 've said so in my first comment , just pointing the hypocrisy in spain in dealing with this issues . 
  anyway they ( you ? ), 
  are not going to change , since democracy is not strong defended there . 
  yes that treaty , but even if you ignore the treaty , what justification do you have to annex it in first place ? 
  or you just think portugal should be spain ? 
  you mean the valid treaty that said they have to return it after invading it with france , but never did . 
  it 's not the same as gibraltar , because spain said they would give it back and the uk never said such thing about . 
  jesus spanish nacionalist are the worst , i fell sorry for democrats and catalans and basques . 
  lol, 
  i 've read it 's in the government program to have referendum if the uk leaves eu , and that was voted , so they have a mandate . 
  how an easy to check factual statement gets downvoted lol, 
  ceuta was also portuguese , not that we want it back , nor do we want oliven\u00e7a back that much , but madrid is so hypocrite, 
  we do n't care about , it 's just to show the hypocrisy of madrid . 
  also they wo n't allow votes , they do n't respect the votes in gibraltar , or even let catalunya vote . 
  the same reason they do n't return oliven\u00e7a , that was occupied without any agreement , madrid only has this arguments when it benefits them . 
  ps not that portugal cares about oliven\u00e7a , but the mental gymnastics of the right in madrid is just amazing . 
  give back oliven\u00e7a and ceuta than , since you are so worked up about that , show the initiative . 
  you mean the money eu forced us to borrow to save banks , so we transformed bad banks policies into national debt , that we have and are paying back with interest . 
  and now after doing all the laws changes and policies they wanted , they are talking about sanctions , wtf , fuck them ( eu burocrats ) , they are the ones destroying this great project of europe . 
  the worst is that countries like ours are the ones that is going to suffer more again because of this . 
  nato will still exists even if the eu stopped, 
   are you idiot or what he is a le pen supporter , so do have to ask ? 
  i like that you are getting downvoted for saying facts , , this subs loves the narrative , that the crises is a southern fabrication and is because we are lazy and want money . 
  they are blunt when talking to you , but when you talk back they do n't like confrontation , this 2 dutch `` traits '' are perfectly used by them to justify saying anything , from my personal experience . 
  from my experiences in your country dutch bluntness is used to be able to say every insult you guys want and then you use your other attribute `` we do n't like confrontation '' to escape from rebuttals , you have a great system going that is for sure . 
  jornal de neg\u00f3cios showing its true colors as a moth piece for the austerity from ecb and eurogroup, 
  not in your country , here it keep wanting reforms that only do that , but fighting corruption and fixing the judicial system , they do n't even say a word , you know the real issues afecting the country . 
  they are more worried that we payed unsustainable debt that they helped us get , by forcing us to save banks , so they the northern banks that loaned money to them did n't fail , so fuck the population for banks mistakes . 
  to be fair this is not the hole eu , more the central bank and other financial institutions , but they are treating the south counties as an experiment to make there neo liberal policies , in the name of fixing the counties . 
  i whould t even be mad in a intervention to fix my country problems , but that is not what they did at all . 
  even yesterday there was a news report the bce wanted sanctions for not following their economic proposala , fuck those people , this is what will kill the eu in the end . 
  just took a look at google maps , and the picture is the only part left , and is very far way , it 's even in another region of france, 
  tell that to all the neo liberals running all the financial institutions of the ue that want to force all the south counties to make laws and end social security that they whould dream of proposing on their home country . 
  i wonder the left is more and more anti eu , they are pro the idea , but the eu is more and a neo liberal bastion forcing right wing policies in the name of fixing the counties ( spoiler does n't work at all ), 
  besides what the other poster said , it also did n't snow on the road you 'll take , only the interior and hight places got snow , even if you are going today . 
  anyway is probably going to be hot next week , this last saturday it was almost 30 in braga, 
  i prefer the mountains , so i do n't care about the beaches that much . 
  i am, 
  oil is not even close to be better than spain or italy ( but is something the media loves to repeat ) , we do n't have the same climate for the hight quality products they have . 
  of course , basic portuguese oil is prob . 
  better than mass produced spanish one , but they have lots and lots of offers , just take a look at the oil section in a spanish supermarket , the offer is like wine in variety . 
  you guys prob . 
  do have better beaches , more coast and more warm sea . 
  people here are sometimes very nationalistic about the land and products ( like saying we have the best oil , lol ) , but it 's only about that at least . 
  and my impression ( could be wrong ) is that spain is kinda of the same . 
  wine is , the rest not , but portuguese like to say it is . 
  fuck those counties for trying to have a competent guy and not a neo liberalism and austerity is the way , destroy all public services ( but not on my country , only those filthy southerners ) mouthpiece, 
  why is this man still working this is unacceptable , in national politics if anyone said that about a part of a country he whould be asked to resign so fast , why is this different in the eu . 
  this is not even the worse this idiot did , he kept saying blatant wrong things about our economy and the markets shaked , like he was trying to make it hard for us to recover ( he can join the club with that german finance minister ) , if this is what is center left in the netherlands good thing they lost hard . 
  it 's politicians like this that only care about pandering to some local groups that are going to be the end of the eu , they keep insulting other countries left and right , there is spirit of unity , only i want mine fuck yours . 
  it 's not , but i prefer it to the others that give excuses and find other more or less scientific reasons to justify policies that are based on hate , but lots of people get fooled by the rhetoric , like le pen , brexit , trump , etc not that i like them or respect them more , just that they are easier to fight, 
  i think you are overthinking , this is nothing more than politicians just looking fro their interests and forgetting the long term country well-being . 
  europe is full of this bosos now , that just think next election o the lining their pockets and sprot populism .

  well that 's not really fair , because many countries in europe destroyed their industrial capabilities to conform with european production quotas . 
  in portugal we had a huge industry of fish , cheese , milk , animals , furniture , even cars , and we closed almost 60 % of it ... germany is basically that guy who gives you money not to produce and then forces you to buy their products because you no longer produce them . 
  so yes , portugal and other countries do genuinely have a small economic power , but it could be better if northern countries were n't such cunts forcing us to support their industry ... 
  oh sweden , thou art a heartless bitch ... 
  are there limits to how many times a person can run ? 
  sure but it 's different . 
  i 'm sorry , what ? 
  i do n't remember that ... 
  wrong . 
  not at all . 
  completely different reasons . 
  for 60 years only though . 
  i do n't really know why it matters . 
  everyone keeps talking about that . 
  it 's almost as if with a history of over 900 years , people choose the 60 year period , and ignore everything else . 
  some countries go forwards , some countries go backwards . 
  what a fucked up world . 
  well i can only think of two things that are significant : * the recently bankrupted public bank caixa geral de dep\u00f3sitos '' got a new ceo and team ahead of the recapitalization of it , but it turns out that the team that was appointed by the government do n't want to make their tax records public , which is required for all state banks , and they may be changed . 
  this is significant in national news because it is about an institution that will get a recapitalization using public money , so everything has be to perfect so as to try to solve its economic and structural problems . 
  * in a protest by foreign immigrants asking for citizenship and more rights , since it is very hard to get citizenship and it 's hard to get the same rights as portuguese poeple , a group lead by the right wing nationalist party png got in a brawl with the protesters , and some poeple were hurt in it . 
  this is also significant due to a recent incident where a party member from a rising left wing party was found dead . 
  get used to it . 
  maybe it 's cuz they 're stricter when it comes to drugs . 
  maybe they should become more progressive like us in the south . 
  but idk, 
  shar planina in the latin alphabet, 
  cause they think they 're better than everyone else . 
  well , they read `` collonel '' as curnel and lb as pounds . 
  so yeah , american english is kinda stupid . 
  just say `` espectacular '' ( spectacular , or amazing ) . 
  btw it 's pronounced `` sh-pe-tuh-koo-lahr '' . 
  the `` e '' is produced like its pronounced in the word `` best '' . 
  you went kinda dark there . 
  yeah , it 's kinda like a myth . 
  people talk about it , i learned that in school , but always being told that historians are n't sure . 
  its actually pretty good . 
  i personally love it . 
  its not good for eating while on a diet but it 's very good . 
  porto, 
  why not lisbon , portugal too ? 
  it 's like 2 hours from madrid by plane . 
  same in portugal . 
  well , i can give you an extensive list of them . 
  in portugal there was never even the remote possibility of it getting seats . 
  forget right wing populism . 
  portugals not into that . 
  now left wing populism , that 's the portuguese thing . 
  yeah . 
  it 's changed a lot . 
  it 's become even more irrelevant . 
  it 's almost not a thing anymore here . 
  it never was really a thing anyways . 
  in portugal i think you start learning english at 6 . 
  on the first grade after kindergarten . 
  well , it 's kinda dark , but my city 's football team 's name would very probably be `` gut eaters '' . 
  but it could also be `` the northerners '' or `` the invictus '' ( porto , portugal ), 
  well yes , but you can still force them . 
  make it mandatory , and have them do national tests . 
  if they fail those tests they get a fine . 
  the money will fund education for germans . 
  force them then . 
  they 're not in england anymore or america or whatever . 
  this is n't meant to be racist though , it 's just about the language . 
  in germany you should speak german , in portugal you should speak portuguese . 
  it 's simple . 
  in portugal for example , even though it 's not as i 'd like it to be , it 's pretty good because even though you can be here for a bit without speaking portuguese , there are other things that you really need to speak portuguese in order to do . 
  it 's a little stricter that 's i mean . 
  wow that 's insane . 
  i for one , have the opinion that someone should n't be allowed to stay in a given country for longer than 6 months without knowing and speaking at least basic words and sentences of the local language . 
  sure . 
  everyone ( in the biggest cities that is ) speaks it so ... 
  i 'd much rather go to your country . 
  there at least i could appreciate some beautiful and unique architecture instead of just cheap copies . 
  the iberian peninsula will have more countries that 's for sure . 
  fml, 
  i wish i could watch it . 
  sadly im working . 
  has salvador played yet ? 
  their smug and they fucked up portuguese but i still love them . 
  ( brazil ), 
  in portugal women wear them regularly ... 
  cork production ? 
  definetely . 
  lets unite all our former colonies , and se cwn rule over them again . 
  great idea . 
  unique . 
  again , give then enough time and they will eventually become europeans . 
  portugal or spain were n't european but we became european . 
  time tells the story . 
  but they could if given enough time . 
  maybe `` april captains '' . 
  we are already are bruh, 
  also similar to the portuguese r. 
  latin russian, 
  not yet , not any time soon . 
  cristiano ronaldo and probably vasco da gama . 
  also maybe luiz vaz de cam\u00f5es , although unless you know like poetry you wo n't really know who that is . 
  but they should n't profit over it . 
  or there should be limits to how much profit they can make on it . 
  otherwise it 's gon na go crazy like in the states .

  what did he say ? 
  the media and the way they present what german politicians say is part of it , then you have quite a few football ultras holding massive banners welcoming refugees . 
  i ca n't blame people who get the idea that germany wants them to come . 
  i have a cunning plan , since every tom dick and harry wants to come to europe , let 's take europe to them . 
  it would be the reconqista on steroids , portuguese empire mk2 . 
  they have given the migrants that impression and that is all that matters . 
  good for what ? 
  as in we have enough or we want more ? 
   dehuminzation is the furthest step hate can take . 
  sort of like how certain people like to dismiss those who are worried about mass immigration as nazis ? 
  they are perfectly welcome to seek a better life , just not at the expense of the european people . 
  god this guy again , / pol / seems to like him for some reason . 
  refugees running from the cop 's , camera woman help 's slow the down . 
  i 'd rather that than a real honest to goodness give until i have nothing left fanatic . 
  do n't forget headlines like `` refugees forced onto train 's '' .

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wt8zvuwhwa like this ? 
   you seem to completely lack self-awareness and if you have no desire to explore other viewpoints or consider that your own may be flawed then we have nothing more to talk about . 
  i am curious as to why you people always like to resort to personal insults as a first response when encountering dissenting opinions ? 
   salafism in germany tends to attract complete losers who dream of being important . 
  they are just embracing the `` change '' that germany must undergo . 
  they should just shut up and accept the enrichment yes ? 
  thanks mama merkel . 
   ever consider that maybe you 're in the wrong ? 
  nope . 
   so in what way are you more of an expert than the german vice chancellor ? 
  what credentials do you have ? 
  judging by the stupidity the vice chancellor is saying i 'd rather have a chimpanzee in charge . 
   `` nearly a century '' , because assad is certainly not been that long in power . 
  so his dad was n't a dictator ? 
   syria has been a ** secular coutnry ** for nearly a century , they have nightclubs , bars , ** hijabs and niqabs are banned at universities ** , plenty of women wear short clothing . 
  all done under your friendly neighbourhood dictator . 
   it 's also a bit dumb how people are prematurely assuming new arrivals wo n't integrate . 
  gypsies man , how long have they been in europe , still not integrated . 
  what do you people have against violins ? 
  it really is . 
   over 90 % of the population it does n't seem to matter what the population thinks these days . 
  at least it 's not sweden where a brutal rapist gets community service . 
  at least i 'm not taking pictures of their corpses . 
  actually the yank 's have the largest oil reserves , they are just using other people 's oil first . 
  i think he means that people will turn to the one 's offering a solution , if the mainstream of politics is unable or unwilling to lead , then expect the fringe to become more popular . 
  or they can see how much it has changed europe for the worst and want no part in it . 
   while the normal refugees are `` busy raping those young girls in england can provide you with first hand accounts if you doubt this , as can a few swedish women . 
  looks like they tried it with the riot van , but that shit is weak sauce when compared to the tractor . 
   you are entitled to a free house if your country has a war !, 
  do n't give people ideas . 
   empty accusations and vague appeals to emotions . 
  pretty typical of leftwing political dialogue . 
  is it a happening place ? 
  as propaganda i would give it a 4/10 . 
  what is / pol / ? 
  they sure do look like some underfed terrified refugees to me , what third world country was this video filmed in ? 
  it stand 's to reason that the more refugees that come the greater the costs will be . 
  i am not the one doing the proclamations , senior government figures are . 
   those 200k will bring another 200k of their family members still not a realistic number , an extra 400 or maybe even 600 thousand people would be more realistic . 
   re used to spending a lot more on crises than a couple billion a year . 
  except that this is the new normal . 
  so they are estimating 600 thousand actual refugees and for these people to only bring in 200 thousand more , seems like an extremely conservative number.if you assume that each will person only has two family members , that is still 1.2 million people , if you use a more realistic number of 4 family members that number is 2.4 million people . 
   `` if we forget this , we forget who we are , and we leave europe to the xenophobes , the extremists , who will destroy it , '' unfortunately it appears that pathological altruist 's will beat them to it . 
  why are the police involved in evictions ? 
  bbc : `` those vikings such great guys , they really brought some excitement to britain '' . 
   and he is using facts to back that up . 
  what facts ? 
   `` the erroneous part is that of the people on earth who are able to fly on holiday -- who live at this economic level -- about ** half live outside the western world ** . 
  ** the difference is not that big . 
  ** so half of the tourists come from a population of just under a billion , the other half comes from six billion , i would say that is quite a big difference actually . 
   europe does n't have citizenship by birth . 
  technically the kids get the citizenship of the parents , and not the host nation . 
  do you see your friendly leftwing party letting this intolerable situation stand for very long ? 
  i wonder if there has been pressure to change this ? 
  in any case we have a real world example of the turkish guest workers who are still in germany and do n't look to be returning any time soon . 
  left handers are the next step in the evolution of man fyi . 
   the premise that they are n't going back is flawed and not necessarily true . 
  people suspected for warcrimes are not being sent back , and lets not forget the children they have whilst in europe , are they not now citizens of the country they are born in ? 
  i think you are being overly optimistic in you assumptions that there is a united will to send these people back when whatever conflict is over , and as for bare minimums to survive , i can hear the lawyers cackling in the wings just waiting for the opportunity to pounce . 
   why go to the trouble of integrating them if the whole point is simply for them to have somewhere safe to be until the conflict is over ? 
  because they are never ever ever going back . 
  sweden : `` fuck germoney is out to take our title of humanitarian superpower '', 
  they have a severe case of nazi guilt and white guilt , a fatal combination in my opinion . 
  shifting gears , how barbaric . 
  left . 
  i thought it was funny that the original terminus for the tunnel was waterloo . 
  since coming to australia 15 years ago the government of western australia has tried 2 or 3 times to have a referendum on daylight savings , which is annoying as fuck because voting is compulsory here . 
   i do n't think it will last for 10 years . 
  africa is set to triple it 's population to about 4 billion in 2050 , factor this in and the coming problems from climate change and you will see that there will never be and end to this in your and possibly your children 's lifetimes . 
   either way , you should stop commenting . 
  the news outlets of europe are not much better , what with them fabricating stories of hungarian police beating migrants . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecc2_gz_moq ca n't beat this one tho . 
  free speech , some of us still have it . 
  well if you do n't want to be swamped by refugees you probably should n't encourage them , it was quite irresponsible of her to say what she said and now turn around and demand to spread them around europe . 
  in what way is there a difference between criminal activity and murder ? 
  : ddddd, 
   we also wo n't send back syrians to the first dublin-iii country , that they arrived in . 
  not because we want more syrians . 
  you should probably tell frau merkel to consider her words more carefully next time . 
   there 's a difference between ** criminal activity ** and ** murder ** til murder is not a crime , you should probably get someone to proofread what you type before clicking that save button . 
  it still had sharia which is an integral part of the religion . 
  and the secular identity is remarkably similar to christianity just without the god part 's . 
   making a concentrated effort to provide suitable accommodation and treat them like human beings , did n't you see the video of the `` refugees '' complaining about having to sleep in tent 's , i believe one of them used the words `` do you think we are animals ? 
  american billions : how the usa fund 's ngo 's in eastern europe .

   despite almost 2/3 of the citizens being against the dissolution . 
  i never imagined it . 
  i assumed there were cultural differences justifying it . 
  til . 
  the other paragraph . 
  no long overdue russian invasion ? 
  and btw , which are things that your country has that is worth fighting for . 
  i mean resources , rivers , pastries , whatever ? 
  that first paragraph is some heavy imperialistic/monarchical views . 
  what are your thoughts about break away regions that did not identify nor wanted to remain under the austrian empire ? 
  what of today 's austria ? 
  also , for the ending , i would expect a rerun of some central european alliance , surrounded by countries with opposing interests wanting to take whatever austria has . 
  which is ? 
  what do you have worth conquering ? 
  p.s major thanks for helping to keep the ottomans out of western europe . 
  seems to me he was played . 
  and the pressure at the time rested on him . 
  i remain unconvinced . 
  i may side with the west on the crimean issue , but do n't tell lies or ridicule a great visionary leader that does n't deserve it and likely saved millions of lives . 
  it looks bad on the west and only fuels russian anger . 
  i 've done some digging into it and what i found is that it 's down to gorbachev 's word against those involved in the soviet block dismantling/german reunification negotiations . 
  i have no doubts these were said to gorbachev and everything i read about the man make him a more of credible source than helmut kohl or any american diplomat/president . 
  we all know the profiles and career paths of them all and gorbachev is the cleanest of them all , despite me obviously disliking soviet/russian political stances . 
  gorbachev has also yet to change his stance on this . 
  so , those myths of course base themselves on staunch denial and the absence of written agreement , which are both true . 
  the world of politics and diplomacy is a festering swamp riddled with slimy creatures . 
  i have little doubts gorbachev was played . 
  which is why he 's hated by russians and ridiculed by the west .

  great , albeit depressing to know map . 
  all that 's missing is the game of thrones intro . 
  brace yourselves ... unemployment is coming . 
  it was a verbal contract between gorbachev and the american administration at the time . 
  after it was voided and protested by the russians , they said there was no written form of it and even called gorbachev naive for believing them . 
  i believe it was in exchange for german reunification . 
  germany should have been the line where nato would cease to expand . 
  the russians despise the americans and with this is one of the good reasons . 
  source : a noam chomsky lecture , so take it with a grain of salt or go find other sources , like gorbachev himself . 
  but i tend to believe chomsky .

  yes . 
  eastern and roma mafias basically moved in a decade ago . 
  they run prostitution and drug rings , gambling , loan rackets and the odd child kidnapping . 
  they have speedboats to smuggle drugs into europe from north africa . 
  it 's also one of europe 's main drugs entry points . 
  they battle it out from time to time , raising homicide rates . 
  if you 're a foreigner and live in a villa in the algarve , you better carry a gun all the time . 
  they 're also very likely to know or be involved in the madeleine mcann case , but the amount of noise from the media and the public 's lust for sordid stuff makes it impossible to find anything . 
  yeah , sure the mom did it . 
  that 's really likely .

  in portugal , kids are usually left in really shitty and expensive daycare centers at 4 months old . 
  i 'm curious to know how these will turn out in a couple of generations - the forcefully rejected generation .

  the germans will quickly bury this under downvotes . 
  germany does n't give a damn about ukraine . 
  and the ukrainians should keep that in mind . 
  her party and government has been getting russian money and corporate positions for some time . 
  these former political leaders are sympathetic towards russian demands and do n't care for law or a people they consider problematic and inferior . 
  war ? 
  maybe . 
  but not one involving multiple nations . 
  it will essentially be russia taking ukraine apart and making their people miserable and alienated . 
  like a hammer coming down on a couple of ants . 
  acting with impunity and calculism . 
  remaining sanctionless ( serious ones ) .

  complete disregard of anything other than their own self-interests and being ethnocentric chauvinists .

  first of all , the entire country is cutting back on bus , metro and railways . 
  austerity has crippled garbage pickup and we have seen piling ups regularly on the media and personal experience . 
  ruins and abandonment are common in every major city , not to mention we have smaller towns completely forgotten by town hall services and people .

  * esquisito means weird , not exquisite . 
  * preservativo means condom , not preservative . 
  * a really confusing one : puxar ( x pronounced like a ` sh ' ) means pull and not push . 
  * pudim means flan ( the sweet one ) , not pudding . 
  * marmelada is a hard quince paste typical from here ; other languages borrowed the word but use it for different types of jam . 
  here it 's `` um dois tr\u00eas macaquinho chin\u00eas '' , meaning `` one two three little chinese monkey '' . 
  and portuguese has the reverse situation , it uses `` ter '' ( = spanish `` tener '' ) as both the regular `` to have '' and the auxiliary verb . 
  we use `` smoking '' too . 
  frango is portuguese for chicken . 
  in portugal , instead of the o , it was that stereotypical italian hand thing with all your fingers together , and you hit the person with the tip of your fingers , with your hand still in that position . 
  not gon na lie , `` hercios '' sounds pretty funny . 
  do you call it hercio in the singular form too ? 
  pascal feels a bit weird in portuguese because the words ending in l get it changed to i so the proper plural is pascais which sounds a bit strange , though on second thought , some people do say it . 
  for a lot of units , the use is a bit erratic : even the same person can say newton and newtons in the same conversation and both sound equally fine . 
  yeah and there 's also the rule for words ending in l and m where they change to i and n respectively before adding the s , and some words ending in s that do n't change , and finally words that look regular when written but there 's an o sound in the middle of the word that changes . 
  but yeah , none of these special rules accommodate saying `` 2 euro '' so people do n't say it ( unless you 're bruno aleixo ) . 
  ( i 'm just writing this comment for informative reasons at this point , if anyone happens to be enjoying the portuguese plural rules talk . ), 
  kelvin are n't degrees , though . 
  it 's considered wrong at least in portuguese and english to say `` degrees kelvin '' like you say `` degrees celsius '' . 
  but my point stands , i chose kelvin because i was looking for a somewhat well known unit with a simple plural . 
  we also do n't pluralise pascal or hertz , for instance , as well as most units that are n't in such common usage . 
  yes , but they still all end in s. 
  i have n't heard paus since the escudo either . 
  same here . 
  i think in portuguese there simply are no plurals without an s at the end at all , so any plural thing not taking an s at the end sounds weird to us . 
  probably the same in spanish . 
  ( the only exception i can think of is some units of measurement named after people . 
  people will say 300 kelvin and not 300 kelvins , even though the latter is technically the correct way , and people actually say it like that for more common units : newtons , watts , joules . ), 
  i 've heard a lot of spanish people use `` pavos '' for euros among themselves . 
  also , here we used to use `` paus '' for our pre-euro currency , which sounds really similar but means sticks , so it 's the first thing i thought of when i heard pavos . 
  i wonder if there 's a common origin . 
  yeah , in my generation at least ( teenager in the mid to late 00s ) , people picked it up ( the - a version ) from american hip hop and gta san andreas , and i feel that most people just think it 's basically the same as bro/dude . 
  maybe the younger generations know a bit better due to the more mainstream exposure of us racial dynamics in the past few years . 
  typically 4 meals are considered : breakfast , lunch , * lanche * and dinner . 
  breakfast is usually part of the morning routine . 
  usually some bread or pastry based product or cereal , and coffee , milk or juice . 
  your standard continental breakfast . 
  it felt a bit weird to me the first times i heard english speakers and people from other parts of europe talk about `` cooking breakfast '' , because to me , cooking and breakfast do not go together at all . 
  lunch is typically around 13 , but it 's also common to push it back to 12 . 
  it 's just a hot meal . 
  some people have soup before the main dish . 
  it 's not as common to just eat a sandwich or some snack , like in some countries , there 's nearly always a proper lunch break and a proper meal . 
  some people have lunch in lower-end restaurants or caf\u00e9s on workdays . 
  they usually offer a rotating `` dish of the day '' for cheap . 
  it 's also common to bring leftovers from the previous day 's dinner and heat them up . 
  * lanche * is just a mid-afternoon snack , usually during a short break at work/school/uni , around 16-17 . 
  it 's not a very formal meal and it 's often eaten alone . 
  content-wise , it 's a bit like breakfast but with more savoury stuff sometimes . 
  some people skip it . 
  dinner is usually at 20-21 and it 's pretty much like lunch , except you make and eat it at home . 
  some people , especially children , also have a mid-morning snack around 10 , called * lanche da manh\u00e3 * ( morning * lanche * ) . 
  as for eating at restaurants , apart from what i mentioned about lunch , people usually have group dinners when they want to celebrate something or just have a get-together with friends or family . 
  business lunches at restaurants are also a thing . 
  to be fair , the connotation behind that word is very nuanced and specific to anglophone culture . 
  many languages just do n't have a word as loaded as that , and its implications may be hard to grasp for a non native speaker . 
  the most widespread ones are p\u00e1 , ( literally shovel , but it 's not taken to mean that , probably has a different origin ; also some people spell it pah ) and meu ( my/mine ) , but those are more like `` man '' and not so much like `` bro '' . 
  and they 're not youth slang , you 'll hear `` p\u00e1 '' from people of all ages . 
  you get mostly people in their fifties using p\u00e1 almost as a comma . 
  as for stuff like bro , the main ones i guess are mano ( short form of brother , kind of like dad is the short form of father ) and puto ( kid ) , though i feel like the latter is more popular in the south . 
  they tend to sound a lot more `` trashy '' than the ones in the first paragraph and sound a bit odd if the person saying it is over 40yo . 
  edit : since you 're asking about language and not just country , in brazil they mostly use `` cara '' , which means face . 
  pretty much the equivalent to dude . 
  like i said [ in this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6guijp/do_you_have_a_particule_for_family_names_of/ditg8w5/ ) , de/da/do , meaning of/of the , are really common and have no connotation , while e , which means and , can sound a bit posh . 
  the most upper class looking surnames are ones that preserve 19th century spelling , especially double l : vasconcellos instead of vasconcelos , or meirelles instead of meireles . 
  double l does n't exist in modern portuguese at all . 
  that 's interesting , de/da/do in portuguese surnames ( = spanish de/de la/del and french de/de la/du ) is really common and usually not even included in the short form of the name , e.g. 
  someone whose full name is ana lopes de carvalho will likely be known as ana carvalho . 
  it 's sometimes not even passed on to children . 
  there 's also `` e '' ( = and ) connecting two names , which does sound a bit posh , kind of sounds like what you 're describing for spanish `` de '' . 
  choco is a type of squid , or an animal similar to a squid but not a squid . 
  ok , checked wikipedia and it 's called cuttlefish in english . 
  yeah , outside of portugal i 've had people who were surprised that i was portuguese . 
  most commonly , people have thought i was french , for some reason . 
  i look absolutely normal in portugal , but i might not look blatantly southern european , so i guess some people just assume a rough nationality beforehand and do n't really guess correctly . 
  i 've also had someone not quite believe i was portuguese because i 'm a bit of a quiet guy . 
  google maps uses ch\u00e9quia now actually . 
  yeah , by around may i tend to already have somewhat of a `` construction worker 's tan '' , as we call it . 
  actually there was an earthquake yesterday which was supposedly felt here in porto , but i did n't feel it . 
  i 've only felt an earthquake once . 
  just felt a single up-down pulse on the ground . 
  did n't feel like anything i 'd ever experienced so i figured it would be a minor earthquake , which it turned out it was . 
  i 've slept through an earthquake or two , though . 
  yeah sorry if i did n't make that clear , i did n't mean they were competing ( though rex aired on sic and max on tvi iirc ) , just that one very obviously inspired the other . 
  ca n't really think of an equivalent . 
  when someone 's in a semi-formal situation ( eg someone talking on tv or giving a lecture ) and wants/has to use a more informal word - and here i do n't mean swearing but using words on the level of , say , `` bro '' - they might say `` passo a express\u00e3o '' ( i pass the expression ) before or after they say it . 
  and basically , whenever someone says that , what they say afterwards tends to be disappointingly tame . 
  some old fashioned men apologise to the women in the room , but that sounds a bit patronising to the younger generations . 
  here in portugal we even produced our own version , inspector max . 
  a bit different though , as it was geared towards a younger audience . 
  it actually returned a while ago , and has even appeared in adverts for dacia recently . 
  yeah , that 's true . 
  some of the most popular cartoons in my generation ( i 'm 25 at the moment ) were broadcast in spanish with subtitles . 
  it 's a classic grandparent thing in portugal as well . 
  often the same people who say `` vai com deus '' ( go with god ) every time someone else announces they 're about to leave . 
  there are 7 religious holidays : good friday , easter sunday , corpus christi , assumption , all saints ' day , day of the immaculate conception and christmas day . 
  of course easter sunday always falls on a sunday so the fact that it 's a holiday does n't change much for most people i guess . 
  municipalities can have a local holiday as well , and this is usually a particular saint 's day . 
  i guess new year 's day , which is also a holiday , can be considered sort of religion-related but it 's not really religious . 
  and there 's also carnival ( aka shrove tuesday/fat tuesday/mardi gras ) , which 1 . is not actually religious and 2 . is not actually a holiday : the government decides each year whether it 's going to be a holiday ( which it pretty much always is ) . 
  for comparison , there are 5 political/historical holidays .

  hungary is such a terrible place that the borders must come down .

   taking people only from the refugee camps sounds like it would have been a great idea a year ago or so . 
  well they are not going going to stop coming this year either , or the next , or the next . 
   i 'd rather they be here than dead . 
  if the current situation goes on it is inevitable that more will drown at sea , the only way to stop this is to start a ferry service to europe . 
  this is usually what happens when i do ask for some clarification on how many you would take in , i invariably get insulted . 
  i like to thing that i am a reasonable person so can you please point out which parts of my post you find to be delusional ? 
  * do you really believe that 1 % is going to dictate the culture for the other 99 % ?

  the man looks shell-shocked , that 's the `` omg what have we done '' look right there . 
   why is your side always so sure it will stop at 1 % and never go further ? 
  i do n't know if they deliberately argue in such a way in order to downplay the numbers , and they will never say at which point should we stop .

   feminist critique of multiculturalism . 
  is there such a thing ? 
   radical feminism is a small subset of the social theory that can be ignored . 
  all the university 's seem to be on-board with the radfem agenda , at least the ones in the anglo sphere . 
  i actually watched a feminist in canada equivocate beating your wife with the christian stance on `` spare the rod spoil the child '' . 
   on what ground ? 
  they 're `` french '' . 
  and this is one of the reasons i oppose this mass immigration , once these people are in you ca n't get rid of them unless you want to go down a very dark path . 
  when i used to live in zimbabwe it was a common practice for young people to go to the uk , work for 6 months come back and repeat the process and still be making more money than if they had stayed and worked at home . 
   and the man who presided over all of it is still president . 
  and he still looks the same as he did in the 80 's . 
  the recent proposals by the dutch were sensible in my opinion , only take people from refugee camps , another thing would be to stop the donation of second hand clothes , shoes and food going to africa , that just hurts their economies in the long run . 
  the treaties dealing with refugees will have to be redone in light of the modern era , ease of travel combined with economic and soon climate refugees will soon see any developed country swamped . 
   trust between the countries that looks to have been pretty damaged by the threats on quotas . 
  it 's the perfect shitstorm of media hype , political incompetence and the social media frenzy . 
  i feel for you bro . 
  nothing about this entire fiasco has been clever . 
  and what should these `` hotspot '' countries do when these migrants just start walking to the border ? 
  can they look forward to being called nazis every time a migrant stub 's a toe ? 
  quotas are not a solution , it 's just more hot potato bullshit only instead of handing it to the next country you hand it to the future . 
  the fact of the matter is that the leadership in the eu can not or will not make the hard choices . 
  from some of the comments here i gather that it is comparative to germany . 
  shhhhh , enjoy the ride man . 
  the crazy train has no brakes . 
   asking for help/solidarity or even an eu wide solution is wrong . 
  i seem to remember lots of demands to accept a quota system or else , there was n't much asking going on . 
  at the end of the day the quota system is just a stop gap measure , it will ease the problem in the immediate future without addressing the problem itself , and none of the proposals put forth by the eu leadership will fix it . 
  * letting people work whilst processing asylum requests this will increase the flow , because now you can earn money get sent home and repeat the process . 
  * send the navy into libyan waters to stop smugglers sounds great until you find out that they are planning to bring the smugglers and their passengers back to europe because it 's to dangerous in libya . 
  where is the solidarity man . 
  hopefully mama merkel can learn to tailor her words so as not to invite a similar incident again . 
  so i hear the anti wankers got beaten up . 
  the polish signed a deal for letting the eu determine poland 's immigration policy ? 
  then they most definitely have to follow that rule . 
   why would syrians , afghans or pakistani be a driving force for federal europe ? 
  because it would change the perception of who is german as an example , if anyone that has a german passport and speaks german is a german then it erodes what most people imagine a german person to be like . 
  if anybody can be a german then is there any meaning to cling to the german state ? 
   but there is no benefit to economy either . 
  i was n't speaking in regards to immigrants , just as a generality . 
   ~ ~ if not ... ~ ~ rip sweden . 
  16 % immigrant population is not something you wake up from , i think it is a safe bet that within our lifetime swede 's will become a minority within sweden . 
  of course they do what they do , but does the media have to misrepresent the facts ? 
   they are against equal rights , gays and secular state . 
  none of these things matter , all that matters is the economy . 
   i do n't see any benefit to the establishment . 
  they seek to establish a federal europe , with the current strong national identity 's in europe this will be hard or nigh impossible , so you have to chip away at these things . 
   why they are so determined and even threat other countries to take them in ? 
  it 's because the populations of those countries would revolt in short order if all the migrants went there , so instead of things coming to a head in the near future they are seeking to delay the inevitable . 
  it is amazing that when i watch a news broadcast about a clash between a group of 400 `` racists '' and 3000 `` anti- racists '' i invariably come away with the impression that the 400 attacked the 3000 , yet with a little digging it is exactly the opposite that occurs the majority of the time . 
  the establishment is in favour of mass immigration , the media is just another arm of the establishment .

  i remember getting a similar response from a south african living in canada , some people are genuinely of the opinion that white people owe them reparations . 
  they used to joke about zambians needing wheelbarrows of money to buy bread , i 'm sure the zambians are the one 's telling the joke now . 
  born there , have heard it before . 
  australia was getting migrants from as far as afghanistan . 
   muslims who embrace our values are essentially being betrayed by us . 
  the authority 's in europe seem to repeatedly go out of their way to be accommodating to the most regressive islamic sect 's . 
  i 'm actually living in australia , my dad 's family moved to mozambique and when they went back to portugal he stayed , that 's why the flair . 
   reading about it is surreal for me to , quite amazing how quickly the breadbasket of africa crashed . 
  we have to do more . 
  i have a solution but it will require some sacrifices on our part . 
  migrants are good for the economy yes ? 
  so the solution is to fix the african economies right ? 
  ` how do you do this monsieur fuzzy ' you ask . 
  simple , we send all those who are eager to help refugees to africa , probably using some quota system . 
  these enterprising european 's will surely be a vibrant and colourful addition to the african continent . 
  you seem to be the one who has a misunderstanding on what a refugee is . 
  so a scottish person who has an english passport is an englishman right ? 
  i was born there and lived there until the land `` reappropriation '' began , i left before it got really bad . 
  if one third of a segment of the population is a foreigner then it stand 's to reason that at some point one third of the country will be foreigners given time , and the influx of foreigners is still ongoing . 
   white race til that the english are interchangeable with the scottish , irish , german or any other european ethnic group . 
  the average latvian does not joke about potatoes . 
  thats gold .

  i think australians can be pretty funny .

  an acqueduct from say galicia to alicante would probably be impossible . 
  and these patterns affect relatively large areas - the northeast of spain or even the northwest might not have much water to spare in a given year . 
   saying that this year , the southwest of the iberian peninsula has received less rainfall than desert areas such as the sahel in northern africa . 
  southeast , he means , surely ? 
  and weird , in portugal all this year and summer , even this very past week , has been rainy . 
  and windy . 
  hoping some of it reaches there . 
  how much do you know about spanish separatism and history ? 
  while there are other countries with separatist movements , maybe belgium being the most likely one to actually split , spain is maybe the country with most credible multi separatist movements . 
  and a long history of repression of those , and a lot of 20th century injustices ( from both sides , not just the centralists including separatist terrorism ) are not really healed . 
  the example of the uk , calmly and civilizedly allowing scotland a say and perhaps even real independence is inciting other separatists . 
  if scotland has a right to vote , why do we not ? 
  there is a referendum marked for this november in catalonia by the way , called by regional government , and totally not recognized by central government . 
  one other thing , while i think scotland will probably , more likely vote no by a little bit , and there seems to be relatively little real * hate * or animosity between the different factions ( seriously ) , in the case of catalonia , they would probably vote yes to independence and there is far more rage and resentment involved . 
  i say this having met my share of scots , particularly scots watching england play football or anything else . 
  some more articles on it which will explain it a lot better : http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ed60a76e-38e6-11e4-a53b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3dyyxgkcf http://fortune.com/2014/09/17/spain-catalan-scotland-secession/, 
  he is the spanish foreign minister . 
  it \u00b4 s not his job to interpret eu law , when it is still not clear how it would be applied in an unprecedented situation , and particularly when it has nothing to do with his own country ( though of course , the problem is : it kind of has though he can not admit to that ) and resorting to hinting of things somebody else ( juncker ) thinks . 
  and being the spanish foreign affairs minister it is his job to be able some degree of diplomacy and evading questions . 
  unless you sign up to the opinion of some ( mine included ) that this indeed is impacting somewhat internal spanish politics and his message is also for internal consumption as well as trying to influence the referendum abroad . 
  it \u00b4 s got to be having an influence , for spain to be so loud and meddling in the internal affairs of the uk . 
  this is not the only piece of news - because seriously nobody in spain has anything to do with if scotland and the rest of the uk decide to split and share ~ ~ custody of the kids and dog ~ ~ a currency or anything they bloody well decide to do . 
  their business , everybody keep their nose out . 
  ( and us , see , would you like it if portugal started commenting on spanish separatism or something ? 
  we have as much right to it , or even more than for spain to comment on scotland ) so yeah , am judging how fucked up the spanish are about this referendum by how loud they are and fucked up they sound . 
  lol , that would certainly make things even more fun . 
  the alliance is with england of course , there was no union with scotland or a `` spain '' back then . 
  scotland will be on its own in the case of a divorce , friends before the marriage stay on the side of their friends . 
  but this referendum , while of course it has nothing to do with spain , is like the biggest trolling imaginable which you managed without even trying . 
  amazing . 
  spain really is getting nervous with this . 
  the english really are good , throughout the centuries , at being able to really fuck with the castillians without even trying . 
  bff . 
  in this particular case , it \u00b4 s a compliment to george !, 
  lisbon , we have also had some consecutive weeks of temperatures of about 15-25 . 
  and occasionally some rain drops . 
  everybody is freaking about the cold summer , except it really is quite nice , it \u00b4 s like natural air conditioning !, 
  it \u00b4 s the north atlantic oscillation , it is currently bit southward , so the south-west of europe is getting `` cold '' summers and warm winter ( the last one , maybe the next ) and rain and the north of europe will be drier , warmer summers and colder winters ( maybe . 
  though it might move again before winter ) . 
  it \u00b4 s not quite as ugly as the tour de montparnasse , but not sure it is much of an improvement or less likely to look very dated some decades after it is finished . 
  this is going to be in la defense , right ? 
  so less likely to be as noticeable as the bloody tour de montparnasse ... 
   the us is also cheaper to live in than portugal unless you want to live in the biggest cities or places like california . 
  or need healthcare , and let \u00b4 s face it , you will need it sooner or later . 
  according to this site http://www.apren.pt/pt/destaques/leitura-da-apren-da-fatura-energetica-portuguesa-2013/ in 2012 about 400 usd / m3 , not too cheap but not the worst either , but we really use very little of it compared to almost everybody else . 
  according to edp \u00b4 s invoices , it \u00b4 s used for about 2-3 % of total electricity , below direct electricity imports and i think it \u00b4 s mostly for auxilliary purposes like starting boilers and a helper in fossile cogeneration - and i guess we are keeping the gas plants for emergencies like drought years . 
  i don \u00b4 t think you should count on a high speed internet connection in rural places . 
  maybe if not too far from the coast . 
  and portuguese knowledge is probably not essential , most younger people will speak some english anyway . 
  hope that does not depend on getting a job in portugal . 
   a pint of beer you mean grade de minis, 
  yes , most of it is wind and hydro , particularly in winter . 
  but we still use some coal for baseline , in summer mostly and a small percentage of gas . 
  portuguese electricity production is very dependent on weather , particularly rainfall because of pumped storage . 
  so it changes a lot from year to year , month to month . 
  this is the 2013 data , in portuguese sorry http://www.publico.pt/ecosfera/noticia/quase-60-da-electricidade-consumida-em-2013-foi-renovavel-1619592#/0 the bars are by order - big hydro ( not sure why they distinguish it from small hydro but nevermind and don \u00b4 t know how they count pump storage of wind generated power ) - wind - coal - fossile cogeneration - other renewable - imports - gas, 
  they are getting it cheap because they do not actually need it much , so if gazprom wants to sell them gas , they need to lower prices . 
  a good argument to build lng terminals everywhere . 
  portugal http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/port_of_sines#lng_terminal so the gas can come from anywhere , according to where it is cheapest . 
  plus we probably use a lot less gas than most other countries . 
  burn gas for electricity ? 
  shocking idea . 
  national day - 10th of june city of lisbon municipal holiday - 13th of june and often corpus christii national holiday falls near or between the same dates . 
   the gulf state called for all criticism of religion and of prophet mohammed to be made illegal in norway . 
  the onion would not have gone this far . 
  what , you think any mass media is imune to being manipulated ? 
  and like you yourself said , the title really does not seem to match content . 
  wonder why . 
   what 's with that anti-german propaganda , lately ? 
  russian propaganda , i guess . 
  i thought that was the whole problem with ukraine . 
  because if they think gas will flow through north korea and some does not stay there , lol, 
  are they expecting to be able to sell gas or oil to north korea and get in return ammounts of tradeable ( hard ) currency ? 
  lol . 
  this is going to be fun to watch !, 
  i have no idea . 
  portugal most certainly doesn \u00b4 t . 
  banning wine at meals ( if one is not working or driving ) sounds un-portuguese and un-catholic . 
   punctual train service like the sbb from switzerland would be nice do you know how much swiss train fares cost ? 
  they better be on time for what you pay !, 
  ( actually have caught some with a few minutes delays ), 
  the lisbon flag is most often seen without the shield and title http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/bandeira_de_lisboa the version with shield and title is also legal , but is not used often , and ( always , maybe ) officially . 
  just the black and white pattern - and look down into city pavements and you will see that a lot . 
  when they are rolling into paris i guess . 
  our pilots will bravely and efficiently overcome all obstacles to do their duty the same article said they had already found an alternative source of food and had a rota installed for the supply . 
  ( and you can trust soldiers and truck drivers to always figure out fast where something eatable can be found ), 
  hey probably plane fuel is cheaper down there !, 
  ( though sadly the portuguese media is reporting the pilots are finding dutch army sandwiches uneatable and having to improvise somewhat ) . 
  more seriously , portugal is a founding member of nato and lots of military colaboration with the us since even before then , i think since mid second world war . 
  in portugal , the only starbucks are in the centre of lisbon ( and maybe porto ? ), 
  and they are full of tourists . 
  so much tourists the most central one has the bathroom locked , they give you a code when you buy something and got big warnings to watch out for pickpockets . 
   edit ; also , children should n't be seeing sex , let alone bdsm these particular stamps , while they are sexy ( but not sex ! ), 
  for somebody past puberty , not sure children would even remark on it . 
  naked buttocks , children would probably think it hilarious and funny ( and well now there is an argument to not have these stamps , children might think mooning is socially acceptable ) but the rest , the connotations , i doubt they will get it . 
  a man \u00b4 s face with moustache , a kind of naked men , they will almost surely take it at face value rather than remark if you are already thinking about sex and noticing sexy things , you will notice the sex . 
  if not , not so much . 
  and btw naked bodies = / sex !, 
  naked bodies is just naked bodies , ( particularly in a country addicted to sauna , i guess ) . 
  they are beautiful .

  and eu has many mechanisms to control their institutions . 
  eu websites and press releases are not corporate media . 
  research instead of demanding things that are already in place . 
   ( not some fucking somali going welfare shopping ) across borders , reinforcement of outer borders do you watch the news on the eu or you just like to spit misinformation ? 
  also chief negotiator of brexit . 
  i think it goes for most eu countries . 
  difamation , fraud and other things may get confused with freedom of speech but we should be able to know the difference . 
  read the article and you 'll know why there are decimal numbers . 
  no , i think the reason is that there are different dates according according to whoever recognized the independence ( one of the most important is the papal declaration ) . 
  that 's not the independence . 
  indeed , i do n't agree with the author about our low proficiency in english , i rather think we are above average in terms of speaking a foreign language . 
  in the article the author presents how the information was gathered . 
  read the disclaimers . 
  read the disclaimers . 
   good . 
  nothing else would be constructive . 
  i think it 's the opposite of good , just look at the exemples of bees and ants to see what are they capable of doing when they work for the community first and not their own interests . 
  because the eu makes sure that the funds are done for their specific reason . 
  - everything ok ? 
  - everything ok , and you ? 
  - everything ok . 
  but those eastern europeans are european citizens since they joined the eu . 
   then an act of war may be warranted that 's really what we need !, 
  it 's about fact-checking , not censoring . 
  they are relocating them and trying to integrate people in european countries , but those who are n't willing to integrate are being sent to countries that will accept them , because yes , you ca n't just send them like the african country is going to accept them and thank you . 
  and you have the example of the agreement with turkey to stop refugees coming to europe . 
  to be continued ... 
   `` lets allow millions of economic migrants from africa and me who will fragment our society , bring social/racial tensions of unknown proportion , all because we are not racist stopped reading here . 
  go to the european comission website and read what eu politicians say about the refugee / migrant crisis instead of reading the sun or the daily mail . 
  have your heard about the fundamental freedoms of the eu ? 
  games are produced by studios , companies , which are located geographically in a country . 
  why put the white category if we 're talking about age ? 
  it 's not the young people that are voting for right wing politicians . 
  it 's the old ones . 
  it 's bad that it 's on position 202 along with foreign news channels in portugal . 
  and we get oliven\u00e7a back !, 
  portugal is really cool in this map . 
  in portugal we learn english for most of our school years and french for 2-3 years . 
  i did n't say that . 
  i just said that the biggest benefict for the uk is the access to the open market , but to many countries that 's not the biggest benefict . 
  then you thought wrongly . 
  it 's a political and economic union , which indeed englobes free trade but much more . 
  if you only want free trade you can follow norways ' example and join the single market . 
   i 'm all for economic free trade zone ) . 
  because that 's the benefict to your country . 
  that 's why everyone hates british exceptionalism , we are not going to do only what is good for you , we are not here to work for you . 
   there are other countries beside the eu with which us can trade . 
  same goes for the eu . 
   it took the americans , brits and rest of the anglos are n't you forgeting no one ? 
  because pretty much the majority of the eu countries fought against the axis , not just the anglo countries . 
  you should check out the other games , i enjoyed a lot the one about discrimination in neighbourhoods . 
  [ mods ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4znu82xhe ) jk it 's good to see we have mods that are n't radicals in all their decisions . 
  that 's because they go over your country , but how many of that border is in percentage compared to yours ? 
  you have a border with russia , if that does n't mean you are eastern european there might be something wrong . 
  relevant : [ european comission take on youth \\ ( un \\ ) employment ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catid=1036 ), 
  nice way to save . 
  maybe for comparing between poor countries but we 're comparing between developed countries . 
  gdp does n't measure quality of life , which i think it 's what better describes success . 
  hdi should be used to compare success between `` rich '' countries . 
  and with hdi you also have one that adjusts to inequality , so in 2016 usa is on # 19 in the inequality-adjusted hdi . 
  since when does gdp equals success ? 
  portugal and spain can into eastern europe , 
   - it won eurovision this year ** triggered ** -, 
  so in portugal no party with seats in the parliament is anti-eu , does it mean we 're 100 % pro-eu ? 
  today i saw this site to understand more of the events , i recommend you to do the same : http://www.warsawrising.eu/, 
  must have sucked to be the 1st guy, 
  step 2 : ** depression **, 
  spain as other website that 's similiar to reddit but it 's in spanish , do n't remember the name tough . 
   nearly the whole world exageration much ? 
  first of all , the eu says that there is ** no evidence ** based on the test they had made at the time . 
  second , you can read what dirk jacobs said , that ** legally ** these products are different products and that 's why they ca n't be compared . 
  give me a link where someone that belongs to the eu said it was not true . 
  probably the 135 upvotes . 
  it 's not only them seaking help and treatment , it 's nurses searching for them and giving them supplies every week . 
  i think it 's not only the decriminalization but rather the help the social workers and health staff give to drug addicts . 
   well it apparently mattered a great deal when it was fewer women in universities that 's because they were forbidden from going to university . 
  give rights to people . 
  yeah , we should burn all the books !!, 
  and chase some people , probably . 
  since it is the eu bookshop i would be very confused if it was n't pro-eu . 
  we should help first because we 're human beings , and second if you do n't help those people they wo n't stop existing , and desperation makes people do things that should n't be done . 
  yes , it 's a problem , but it 's not like there 's many viable options that do n't include helping those in need . 
  obviously it is a problem , how can you think that people fleeing from war is not a problem ? 
  the reason it has continued to be a problem for so many years it 's because there 's not an easy solution , and without the cooperation of north african countries it 's even harder to tackle the issue . 
  there was already a problem with refugees before 2014 , you just did n't care enough . 
  maybe when some russian tourists decide to take some vacations in finland we can say , good , take it all and leave the rest of europe alone . 
  so much for european solidarity ... 
  they do n't get deported but they do n't get the help the refugees get . 
  is being a member of the eu a right or a privilige ? 
  until brexit this sub was in favour of the remain at indyref . 
  those generals ( ? ), 
  were the people who i less expected to enjoy this show . 
  [ mods ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4znu82xhe ) jk i understand the position of the mods , hope you 'll figure out eventually how to best handle the situation , 
  we need to invite them to eurovision . 
   uk is part of the eu it 's a special deal . 
   they 're from europe what the hell are you talking about ? 
  do you think it 's people from europe that go to somalia , ethiopia and every other broken place to smuggle people into europe ? 
  stop regurgitating what others say and start informing yourself about the world . 
  libya is just a coastal country that serves as a passage , not the origin . 
  the smugglers are not in europe , that 's why they are n't being arrested .

   one flag already done that !, 
   one european anthem i like the current one !, 
  beethoven was a great choice !, 
   athletes united under one flag oh dear , no more portuguese athletes at the olympics or world championships . 
  but no matter , that 's great !, 
   one european central bank ? 
  already have that . 
   we could finally minimize nationalisms . 
  they would be outlawed . 
   and live freely under one european flag . 
  this sounds great !, 
   but what about the capital city ? 
  lisbon , of course !, 
  is there any chance of a contest ? 
  ^ ( * edit : double word ), 
   portugal + italy + spain sorry , i do n't see what these 3 countries have in common more than with france , england , switzerland , etc. 
  ^ ( i see what you did there ) the final countdown ? - ), 
  estados unidos da am\u00e9rica . 
  that 's how it 's spelled here ... 
  * geothermal : i was a bit out-of-date and it 's a nice surprise to see some countries already really using geothermal . 
  please note , however , that only 3 countries have installed capacities above 1000 mw ( us , philippines and indonesia ) ; the rest combined account for less than 40 % ... 
  i really is worth exploiting more !, 
  * solar and wind : i saw that episode . 
  but tyson just glossed over this problem of intermittency . 
  but in that kind of show i really do n't expect this level of detail . 
  he could have mentioned that there are technical issues with solar and wind power , for the sake of completeness and showing both advantages and issues , in the spirit of science , however ... 
  thanks for the wikipedia article , it is very well written . 
  it explains very well the problem ; note that even thermal solar power does n't work , e.g. , at night . 
  there are several strategies being investigated to overcome this problem , but for now ... 
  but what it means for portugal ? 
  we built  6000 mw of wind power farms , and essentially need as many in continuous sources . 
  this means we are building new fossil fuel plants ; hydro and existing gas plants are not enough ... we ca n't even sell excess production : our neighbour spain invested in exactly the same type of plants ... 
  when we have wind , so do they . 
  :-( e.g. , denmark can install as many wind farms as they want , because their neighbours , e.g. 
  germany , absorbs ( buys ) every mwh they can send . 
  no such luck for us ... a real european energy market would really help us . 
  * nuclear : regenerating plants are still pretty much in the future , but i 'm sure we 'll get there . 
  hope you 're right about the oil + gas !, 
  just a few notes about the other energy resources , please ignore if you already know : * wave and geothermal production are still in development . 
  the problems are strictly technical at this point -- there are n't production power plants of this kind anywhere in the world . 
  i think iceland has experimental thermals feeding their ( small ) power grid , but are n't really considered `` production plants '' . 
  in the future , i 'm certain we will overcome the technical issues . 
  they will be important because : * solar and wind are intermittent sources . 
  the technical issue here is nobody has yet developed an efficient scalable way to store electricity . 
  and it 's a tough one . 
  not impossible , but still far in the future . 
  * nuclear needs a huge investment to just start . 
  and it has its own set of troubles ( what to do with spent fuel ... ) -- but it does provide the better guarantees right now to replace fossil fuels for electrical production . 
   i think we should form a party and take this into our own hands , what do you say ? 
  lol haha . 
  but hey , thinking a bit about it , that 's not such a stupid idea as it looked at first glance ... 
  i sure would like to make some things change . 
  and some existing parties were based upon much narrower/crazy ideas after all ... let 's do it !, 
  thanks for the link . 
  it has heart-wrenching stories about poor people in porto -- nonetheless , i did n't see it claiming the the city is one of the poorest ( i may have missed it ? ) . 
  unfortunately , stories like those can be found across the whole country . 
   oil and gas off the coast of algarve . 
  there is no evidence of it yet . 
  much less operating wells ... that news is about repsol an portugal signing a contract for exploration of the area . 
  `` exploration '' as in `` we 'll drill some holes to see if we find anything '' . 
  alqueva is a tragic example of a 1950 's project that is concluded dozens of years too late to matter . 
  it had the potential , but the timing was its death . 
  hydroelectric potential is now almost 100 % used . 
  the 9 dams in project or in construction are now of the high-cost-low-yield kind . 
  but do n't get me started on the electricity production , i warn you !, 
  there are so many wrong things that whole books were published on how badly we have it now . 
  just check your last receipt from edp and we 'll have plenty to talk about ... 
  the eez and a\u00e7ores do have lots of potential , but only that . 
  no known real natural resources in use : even fishing industry is in decline !, 
  :-( and this is a particular bitter point against eu for us . 
  there is still only one geothermal power plant in s. miguel , and i already saw it some 20 years ago . 
  it 's not even a production plant , it 's only for research purposes . 
    state actively discourages private investment and new businesses . 
   what do you mean ? 
  stifling bureaucracy : the simplest industry project needs to be pre-approved by as many as 23 different state agencies . 
  some of them ( notably the environment one ) known to take years to veto a project , offering no reasons or alternative solutions . 
  some of the requirements are so absurd that it really we do n't have to look further for reasons why foreign capital just goes elsewhere . 
  as for the famous `` business in the hour '' , it remains a lie as long as the pre-approval requirements are n't turned into the `` automatic approval with post-supervision with heavy fines for non-compliance '' system that other european countries use . 
  the current government promised this , but once again ... nicles . 
  finally , about the solution : yes , industry is the main component of any promising plans for the future . 
  but see above . 
  we have a lot to change here . 
   porto is one of the poorest counties . 
  sorry , but be is n't my favourite statistical source . 
  as in , `` i do n't believe anything they say at this point '' . 
  we do have 3rd world like situations like the one you describe , but we 're not really alone there . 
  and as for nepotism , or more generally trade of influence between the rich and powerful : that is how this country works -- and seems to have been that way forever . 
  now , i must disagree with :  porto is one of the poorest counties in the country . 
  no it certainly is n't . 
  and \u00c9vora richer than most of the algarve ? 
  i ca n't believe that without numbers ... 
  again , i agree with everything you say , with just one question :  we 're a small country , it should be very easy for us to create wealth how ? 
  * no natural resources , total dependency on fossil fuels , solar + wind electricity proved to be a financial hole ( friends at edp paid by law in a most anti-capitalistic way ) instead of a new natural resource . 
  * low education of the population , compared with europe , oecd , ... 
  even developing countries . 
  * from  27000 people with phds , only 700 work in the industry . 
  * state actively discourages private investment and new businesses . 
  * absurdly slow and ineffective justice . 
  * high taxes ... 
  need i go on ?

  hey , at least your elections are getting some spotlight . 
  cholera is sounding really enticing then . 
  i 've been asking that question since 2008 . 
  yes please . 
  at least you have autobahns without speed limits ... 
  the german authorities need to look into this . 
  it 's time to crackdown on these `` muslims '' that issue death threats and also to crackdown on foreign agents funding these lunatics . 
  appropriate user name . 
  so they 're training us fighter pilota to fight against european fighters ? 
  interesting ... 
  if the kant was tough they would refer to the `` cunt '' with respect and fear instead of cheeky jokes . 
  i think it would be kind of awesome and somewhat ironic to name tanks after european philosophers . 
  `` oh the kant is a mean bastard . 
  he has great plating and although his main gun has a yy caliber , it has great mobility '' . 
  the nietzche is the fucking best . 
  he obliterates anything that comes before it into nothingness . '', 
  aaaw , now i want a mini-woolly mamoth . 
  when i saw tsunami in the title my first thought was `` oh shit '' . 
  then i saw 4.0 earthquake and 4 dead and felt relief because i was expecting a much bigger tragedy . 
  my condolences to the dead . 
  that 's not anti - british . 
  just anti - english . 
  british tourists really do know how to act like perfectly obnoxious assholes when they put their minds to it . 
  you fail to understand that the purpose of freedom of movement is not to just have specialists easily moving from one country to another . 
  i do n't know if this your british perspective but the eu is more than just a free trade agreement but a supranational organization . 
  i went hiking to ger\u00eas today in the afternoon . 
  and we passed by a madman cyclist at 1pm with 38 degrees of temperature . 
  i do n't know ... chaplin made those mustaches very compelling . 
  no shit sherlock . 
  all western countries selling arms to the saudis and their cronies are funding terrorism and terrorist ideologies . 
  the sarcasm is strong with my countryman . 
  but the typical eu bureaucrats ignore these important issues . 
  vote for me in the european parliament and i 'll promise to fight for japan in eurovision !, 
   sorry but this is n't a team sport where i agree with every extreme shit my `` team '' members say . 
  so much this . 
  so many people now treat politics like a team sport : if someone shittalks their team , they rush to defend it and completely turn a blind eye to the outrageous things said by some people from their team . 
  then we invite south korea . 
  and we have a fight between j-pop and k-pop . 
  we first need to negotiate in this trade deal to get japan in the eurovision contest . 
  i want to see j-pop in eurovision . 
  exactly this . 
  i do n't know how things have gotten to the point where the political discourse became so poisoned that the objective is just to offend the opponent instead of actually developing one 's own solutions to govern better . 
  or when it became a trend to see the political opponent as an enemy instead of a compatriot with different views . 
  if i 'm not mistaken he had the second longest rule of portugal as an independent nation since the 12th century . 
  i ca n't find a source right now to corroborate this , though . 
  he stayed far too long in power . 
  but the regime he established was n't just him . 
  when he left , his successor marcelo caetano , tried to reform the regime but the hardliners ( including the president at the time ) sabotaged the reforms that marcelo caetano tried to do to modernize and open up portugal . 
  the regime at the time did n't see itself as european , but as an atlantic catholic empire . 
  the same as in portugal then . 
  he 's viewed as a dictator that lead to the stagnation of portugal and to dragging us into the colonial wars . 
  however , the portuguese estado novo did n't commit nearly as many atrocities as those commited by other fascist regimes . 
  in fact , if you read his private correspondence he severely disliked hitler , mussolini and franco because they were too `` flashy '' . 
  he did n't see himself as a fascist and admired england and did everything he could to maintain the alliance with the uk without having to get into ww2 . 
  it 's still a bit early to accurately assess him and his rule because you still have plenty of people left alive that suffered under the previous regime . 
  in the history books at least they give him some merit for managing to stabilize portuguese finances when he became the finance minister and then the prime minister and for keeping us out of world war 2 . 
  but he sure did screw portugal afterwards . 
  he was a very complex character . 
  it 's at this moment that i 'm quite happy that the portuguese society has been mostly immune to these extreme right-wing types . 
  hey , you also produce fiats for europe and the tipo is selling moderately well . 
  and schwifty arabia for taking down their pants and shitting on the floor . 
  the conservatives are screwed either way . 
  those damn leprechauns steal jobs after all . 
  and i hear they believe the earth is actually millions of years old . 
  tzeentch would be proud . 
  i really hate the guy , but i have to hand it to him : he knows how to troll . 
  the exact problem is the different `` thematics '' . 
  you are comparing apples with oranges . 
  one is supposed to be a news media , and they have more responsabilities ( and at least in portugal , journalists have an ethical conduct they should adhere to ) than a humouristic magazine . 
  so you do n't seem to understand the difference in social responsability between the media and comedy magazines . 
  next you 're going to tell me that you disagree with the onion and that they should be more accurate when they 're doing parody pieces . 
  if that does n't happen , tell him . 
  the horror of actually having to interact with a person . 
  considering that trump is n't running for elections in germany , there 's a big difference between that and insulting one of the candidates in the election of one 's own country . 
  & nbsp ; charlie hedbo is satirical , and has always been satirical . 
  not a newspaper whose stated purpose is to report news . 
  you ca n't also see a difference there ? 
  they live on making outrageous jokes but no one buys charlie hebdo to read the news because that is not their purpose . 
  & nbsp ; it 's not in vogue to hate british press because of brexit or not hat charlie hedbo because they suffered a terrorist strike . 
  you have plenty of problems with british ** tabloids ** ( there 's plenty of reputable british newspapers that are among the best in the world ) . 
  you can even google about a tabloid that illegally wiretapped celebrities for example . 
  & nbsp ; you really seem to have a hatred by charlie hebdo . 
  i agree that they are controversial and their humor is not for me but if you are incapable of analysing and understanding the differences here , then there 's not much i can tell you . 
  oh , they have partisanship and even a bit of propaganda . 
  but there 's a modicum of civility and respect by the other side . 
  because there 's still a belief that a political opponent is not an enemy that has to be destroyed . 
  you know ... 
  the basis of every democracy is respect for someone with opposing ideas . 
  is this for real or is it fake ? 
  because it 's beyond retarded . 
  maybe some of these brain-dead `` feminists '' should try sitting with their legs closed for a prolonged period of time with sweaty balls . 
  this position is confortable . 
  does it occupy space ? 
  yes . 
  if the public transport is full is it that hard to ask the guy to close his legs ? 
  why the need for a ban ? 
  if you are doing these type of question i bet you are not strong and proud . 
  strong and proud people do n't question . 
  because they 're strong . 
  and proud .

   that 's why automation is such a big problem , because if everyone creates their products via automated means , then who is going to buy them ? 
  production is only automated if the investment is economically sound . 
  that means that the decreases in production cost enable the company to sell them at lower costs , if needed . 
  that 's essentially why some decades ago companies such as ibm were announcing that the global market for computers possibly had about half a dozen potential clients , some decades ago only middle class families could afford one , and nowadays everyone owns about half a dozen computers . 
  heck , there was already a magazine sold for about 10 $ which shipped with a fully functional computer that was being given away as a promotion . 
  that 's what you get with automation . 
  i 've just noticed / u/respect _ my_slavspace is a days-old account which has been using incessantly to troll . 
  have a good day . 
   how does it work in the rest of the eu countries ? 
  sweden has been gradually reducing their sovereign debt since the 90s , where it peaked at around 80 % gdp . 
  germany has also been reducing its sovereign debt down to the limits established by the stability and growth pact since it peaked at 81 % gdp in 2010 . 
  the trick is not to overspend , cut government spending , and plan on amortizing the nation 's debt . 
  crazy thing . 
   you do realize that every time you do that you add interest to your already existing debt right ? 
  tell that to the nations that emit debt at negative interest rates , or have been replacing expensive short-term debt with exceedingly cheap long-term debt . 
  not to mention that nowadays interest rates have been far below inflation . 
  contrary to what you 've claimed , refinancing debt can and does lead to cheaper debt , and even leads to the reduction of the overall amount owed . 
   greek people are complaining that the bailout money was not used for the good of the country but was to `` pay back debts '' . 
  it 's like [ debt refinancing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refinancing ) does n't exist . 
   how you turn a country into rubble without a single bomb being dropped . 
  easy . 
  just pile up years of double-digit deficits , rack up a massive sovereign debt , cook the books to hide the financial crater , and then just watch your country 's economy collapse due to the financial hole the long sequence of democratically elected governments created for the country . 
  the next step , of course , is to try to pin the blame on some scapegoat . 
  an evil foreigner always does the trick , particularly if somehow you can associate them with ... say ... nazis . 
   because we 've got a very long history of pp/psoe manipulating everything in order to make the competence look dirty . 
  for your conspiracy theory to hold any semblance with reality , either the transaction records are fake or they are real . 
  and i 'm yet to see anyone from podemos coming close to claim anything remotely similar with regards to the evidence collected by spain 's anti money laundering system . 
   yeah why do n't you try find a judge that agrees with you because judges are bound by the laws of their jurisdiction alone , they need to comply with each and every technicality , they are compelled to respect loopholes , complex criminality is n't simple to investigate , and they are forced to follow the output of the investigation that is possible with the limited resources at their disposal . 
  and receiving a payment for a service is n't illegal per se if the real motivation behind the money laundering scheme ca n't be proven `` beyond a shadow of a doubt '' . 
  spain 's anti-money laundering system may have uncovered series of shady payoffs between iran and podemos ' cronies through offshore accounts , but if they are laundered as a series of payments between shell corporations through offshore banks which are outside of spain 's jurisdiction and therefore are out of reach from spain 's judicial investigation ( that 's precisely why they are picked , right ? ), 
  then the only info that the judge can evaluate is that podemos ' gang was paid off for some sort of service whose details are immune from any investigation . 
  consequently , the only info on the subject is this damming evidence that iran has been caught paying off podemos through offshore accounts , which in turn is justified like all criminal organizations involved in organized crime claim : they are only honest businessmen doing honest work , and they ca n't recall any detail on questionable practices . 
  as a result , all judges have no alternative but to give up on the case . 
  this is precisely why organized crime succeeds and complex crimes involving corrupt political organizations are impervious to this sort of investigation . 
  otherwise , this sort of criminal organization would n't use this scheme . 
   i guess when your current ruling party has been exposed of taking bribes * does this mean that podemos and other corrupt political parties with ties to organized crime and foreign dictatorships get a free pass ? 
   you forget that said commission is 90 % made of old affiliates and friends of the pp and psoe even if that was true , why do you believe your conspiracy theory trumps the transaction records ? 
  i mean , either you believe these financial transactions are fabricated , or you 're trying to intentionally turn a blind eye to the facts . 
  and the truth of the matter is that some of podemos ' cronies already were compelled to resign from podemos ' leadership due to their direct involvement in illegal funding schemes involving payments from venezuela 's regime . 
   these allegations have been taken to court many times and nothing has come out of them . 
  the same can be said , and is frequently said , about any trial involving organized crime and complex criminal cases . 
  the main reason why `` nothing has come out of them '' is due to the international nature of these criminal networks , the difficulty of unraveling money laundering schemes such as the ones put together by podemos ' cronies , limited time and resources allocated for each investigation , and the loopholes these organized crime groups exploit to allege that `` technically '' they did nothing wrong or illegal , and are nothing more than honest businessmen . 
  for a very concrete example , the former prime-minister of portugal is currently being investigated for being involved in a similar criminal organization as podemos ' cronies , but instead of receiving payments from iran or venezuela he received payments from construction companies . 
  investigators already caught him receiving cash payments from the companies , loans , was hired in a fake high-paying job by a pharmaceutical company setup to launder payoffs from the construction companies , his personal chauffeur already testified he personally delivered cash payments sent between members of the organized crime network , etc etc etc. . . 
  in fact , the former prime-minister was even living in a luxury apartment belonging to the ceo of the construction company , and his ex-wife was found paying off her country estate with cash from the criminal network . 
  what does the former prime-minister say in his defense ? 
  that everything is legal , he only has very good friends who are very generous , and he and everyone around him are honest businessmen who worked for everything they have . 
  pretty much like podemos ' cronies have been saying from the start . 
  in both cases , everyone expects that `` nothing comes out '' of these cases for the exact same reasons . 
  and in both cases , the diehard supporters of each party opt to blindly believe in absurd conspiracy theories , fueled by this notion that `` nothing has come out of them '' which ignore all the technicalities and loopholes these criminal networks exploit to circumvent the judicial system , and pretty much repeat exactly what you said in your comment . 
  it looks like they have a very peculiar way of tackling rampant corruption , which involves doing the exact opposite of what they preach . 
   geez this is the millionth time this type of thing comes up before it 's unreportedly dismissed as false by some judge or something . 
  the article states that the announcement was made by spain 's very own [ anti-money laundering commission ( sepblac ) ] ( http://www.sepblac.es/espanol/home_esp.htm ) . 
  i do n't believe it makes any sense to brush aside the findings of spain 's anti-money laundering commission as mere conjectures , particularly as they provide ample evidence and list money transactions from , to and between podemo 's cronies . 
   these types of attacks from government institutions are making me believe less and less in democracy . 
  do you actually believe that it is absolutely impossible that a political party is involved in corruption cases like the one reported here , and instead you prefer to keep believing on unfounded conspiracy theories instead ? 
  i do n't believe this has much to do with being self-managed . 
  from the article , the company is managed like any run-of-the-mill private for-profit company . 
  the co-op members act as small shareholders , all decisions are made by the board , production is pushed to third-world countries to cut manufacturing cost , etc etc etc. 
  perhaps the main difference between regular private for-profit companies is the fact that the workers of this co-op were more willing to accept wage cuts , which is always depicted as a criminal suggestion with companies structured in any other way . 
   but automation in and of itself means reduction of workforce not necessarily . 
  automation means that goods may be cheaply mass-produced . 
  mass-production enables more people to afford purchasing a good that otherwise would be too expensive to purchase . 
  nowadays anyone has about half a dozen computers within their reach , while only a couple of decades ago a rudimentary computer would be sold for the same price as a used car . 
  this revolution happened due to the fact that computers became cheaper to produce due to the huge investment in automation . 
  scissors are a penny a dozen while in the not so distant past they cost over a month 's wages . 
  clothes would cost mont 's income , and fabric as well . 
  people would actually be compelled to weave their own fabric and produce their own clothes to be able to afford them . 
  but nowadays you can purchase an entire wardrobe for the same price you would pay for a stake dinner in a not so fancy restaurant . 
  all that thanks to automation . 
  even if that means hand-making scissors ceased to be a profitable activity . 
   let the poor pay if the vast majority of a country is `` poor '' , and the poor hold the bulk of the nation 's cash , where else would your government get the cash it needs to pay its overspending ? 
   we have more debt because `` restructuring '' destroyed our gdp there 's this little detail that greece had been running 10 % deficits for years , which previous governments tried to hide by forging greece 's accounting , and once greece was forced to admit it was bankrupt it had no alternative to simply stop overspending . 
  oh yeah , because he never was a leading politician in his whole life and [ never was a fan of publicity stunts . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwz1dk3lbm4 ) in fact , he did n't played his part as a tv personality to advance his political career at all . 
  no populism . 
  none at all . 
   you do n't know him , and already assumed that he is a shit person . 
  he is n't , stfu . 
  he 's right , though . 
  marcelo rebelo de sousa dedicates himself to self-promotion stunts like this one . 
  he does his best to do everything in front of a camera crew and a conveniently friendly reporter . 
   what is the path forward for greece here ? 
  would n't it have been better to declare bankruptcy and work from the bottom up ? 
  argentina suggests that that path is a whole lot worse . 
  additionally , starting over does nothing to fix greece 's underlying problems , particularly as defaulting on its debt would cut greece 's access to foreign loans . 
  you seem to be trying very hard to confuse things . 
  we 're taking about the voters , and what they actually believe and want . 
  you 're either intentionally missing the point or completely oblivious to the issue being discussed . 
  i mean , are you actually aware of the topic being discussed ? 
  the bit about gays and jews voting to push anti-immigration policies ? 
  are you still yet to understand that they do hold an opinion , but their opinion is n't dictated by a political party and instead are resorting to tactical voting to defend their personal interests ? 
  is it that hard to understand ? 
  i hope not , because otherwise there is no auto-translator to help you with that problem . 
  it may seem that way to you , but only if you miss the point . 
   like they do n't eat awesome jam\u00f3n looked at / u/coolanteater 's flair . 
  spain . 
  naturally . 
   the biggest problem with democracy imo is that the best manipulators of human emotion are the most likely to win an election , rather than the most qualified/person with the most agreeable policies that is n't a problem at all , considering that democracy is designed to maximize satisfaction instead of efficiency . 
  if the world cared for efficiency , the world would run by technocratic regimes .

   some portuguese exactly . 
  some . 
  nice played valls . 
  people will listen to his advice and vote for hamon instead . 
  this man is a patriot . 
  albania , what the hell are you doing ? 
  i would focus on the definition of empire , it might be easier than to define the eu . 
  what a strange thing . 
  i heard about her for the first time yesterday . 
  thank you anyway , i did n't heard this song . 
  i 'm sorry , but this was already posted and trended . 
  there 's no need to share it here again . 
  ok , now i did n't express correctly . 
  i said accused , but i did n't meant it in a aggressive manner , only that i believe my personal feelings did n't interfered with my analysis and attitude towards the situation and it would be wrong to indicate i 'm not being impartial in my comment because of that . 
  i did n't meant to imply that you were accusing me of that , although that was basically what i wrote . 
  too much `` aware '' , sometimes . 
  if it was a european regulations it makes it even better . 
  i 'm just imagining them cursing european regulations for not allowing them to burn the flag . 
   `` america for the whites . '', 
  yeah , i think i can ... 
  that 's just soft power in action . 
  soft power often shaped by capitalism , but soft power nonetheless . 
  it has nothing to do with being more or less successful and there is nothing superior about a given culture . 
  that 's not how cultures evolve . 
  i was expecting some comment along those lines . 
  when a huge part of the population travels abroad and when their descents will eventually forget about their parents culture , i ca n't avoid getting sad . 
  despite my personal felling , i think i was quite objective on my assessment , so i do n't believe you can accuse me of otherwise . 
  thanks . 
  oh , ok , that makes more sense . 
  thanks for clarifying . 
  the image shows percentages for left wing parties and for pvv . 
  what did those parties do/say to justify those percentages ? 
  i 'm not disputing that . 
  i 'm just saying that europe does n't make sense in purely geographical terms . 
  in geographical terms europe does n't really exist , it 's all eurasia . 
  europe is pretty much a political/cultural definition . 
  how much citizens ireland has abroad ? 
  wait , what did the other parties do during this row ? 
  do you think this is necessary ? 
  yes , i think i agree with your assessment . 
  it 's not a question of existing an western culture but the enforcement of it and in particular op 's stance towards the ideal of monoculturalism while preaching the existence of a western culture , because if we are strict enough , there is still great divides in it . 
  if you go to france they will tell you how different they are from the portuguese and how they do n't integrate . 
  if you go to catalonia , they will say how different they are from the rest of spain , or flanders and wallonia . 
  when you think of greek culture is it really so different from turkish one ? 
  for a greek it is , but for a western there is a lot of common grounds . 
  looking from portugal , scandinavia and benelux is basically the same people , although people there will say otherwise . 
  the idea that there is one supreme western culture is false as it is divided in various subcultures that are as different as they can be . 
  the west ends at the iron curtain , but before that were did it ended ? 
  russia was an western nation , the ottomans could be regarded as a western nation in many regards , while the us were not . 
  what is now the west changed overtime , why ca n't the west and the east eventually fuse into one unique european culture if the west in itself contains other cultures ? 
  and why ca n't the turkish culture one day harmonize with the west culture and join too ? 
  saying , like op was that there was historical reasons for assuming that turkey is completely different that the west is false and even if it was not , it is no indicator of what it can be in the future . 
  we can only assess about the present and that is that we have a dying democracy in turkey that is not acceptable for our standards . 
  if someday things change ( hopefully in turkey 's side ) , why should we exclude now that they will not be part of the `` west '' like they once were ? 
  that 's clearly an oversimplification of europe 's history . 
  there are countries with muslim majorities in the balkans , iberia has strong arabic influences , greece was part of the roman empire for much longer than western europe and thus never had the influence of the germanic invasions . 
  greece is orthodox , not catholic which is , in itself , a huge cultural divide . 
  greece was not in the new world , whereas portugal , spain , france , the uk ... have huge cultural affinities with non-european countries . 
  sometimes more than european ones . 
  the west liberal culture is not well accepted in countries like poland that are in the eu . 
  our current union was created as an answer to the horrors of ww2 and to put an end to european infighting that has being happening for centuries and it hold it 's meaning in the face of a common enemy ( soviet union ) , but there is no base culture to justify an west culture . 
  the same that there is not justification that turkish culture might not be part of european one in some future . 
  may i suggest immigration ? 
  with so much opposition to integration , your comparison between texas and vermont is a pretty weak one . 
  even more considering vermont was mainly colonized from the british and texas got their independence from mexico , thus having a strong spanish culture . 
  if texas and vermont are capable of share the same union , why would n't a ( democratic ) turkey and germany share another ? 
  one thing is saying that turkey is not in any shape ready to join the eu , the other is justify the way you are justifying , because by the same token , the portuguese , the irish , the swedish ... do n't really have anything to do with the greeks and that european `` culture '' is only an false idealization . 
  the problem with that is that often your own people wo n't `` respect '' your own culture . 
  do you listen to tradicional greek songs instead of international pop/rock music ? 
  do you watch exclusively greek tv shows , instead of american series ? 
  are you willing to stop using american jeans for some traditional greek clothes ? 
  or start consuming exclusively greek food ? 
  what about the language , will you only talk greek in the internet from now on ? 
  i 'm being , of course , really extreme , but my point is how would we define what means to be part of a given culture ? 
  worst of all , when the culture is always mutating due to external influences that none of us want to give in ? 
  i agree that greater steps should be made to ensure assimilation , but that goes mostly through education and not some idealization of national culture that does n't really exist in a non-isolated country . 
  it 's not common to not know the language . 
  second generation portuguese immigrants in france generally do n't know portuguese or know very little of it . 
  portugal is still an important part of their identity , but france comes first . 
  it 's a bit sad , but makes sense that things happen that way . 
  the current turkish case does n't seem normal . 
  well , pretty much any strict metric would end up excluding people who you perceive as dutch . 
  it is mostly subjective , i do n't believe we can establish a objective metric for dutchness . 
  what support do you need exactly ? 
  national leaders have already criticized erdogan 's attitude . 
  if the eu were to do something , people in the netherlands would start crying that we are meddling with internal affairs . 
  and , after all , it 's weekend . 
  but please , tell me exactly what support from the eu you want , instead of whining about the lack of it . 
  with this level of commitment to export , i do n't know why the greek economy is not better shape . 
  ps : i 'm now remembering a situation were our minister of economy suggested that we could tackle the crisis by exporting `` pasteis de nata '' . 
  well , i would be in favor of disbanding or leaving nato and create a european military alliance or an army , so i would say yes . 
  well , brexit will free one space ... 
  i was thinking the same about spain and the uk . 
  it 's less ugly than i though it would be . 
  do n't worry , the portuguese will draw their way into the final battle and only win the war on extra time , if we are lucky enough . 
  after the euro 2016 , that 's hardly fair to the netherlands . 
  how `` stealing '' london 's financial services make luxembourg a natural partner for uk ?

  could it be that greece and italy are unable to do anything because they have to comply with eu law ? 
  regardless of whether you are pro or anti immigration it is certain that western countries will be radically transformed by this . 
   so then , you pit the foreign poor right next to the local poor , and blame them ( the locals of course , foreigners can do no wrong ) for fighting . 
  i was listening to the local youth radio station the other day and the topic was the latest anti immigration party , during the conversation it was repeatedly mentioned that the founders were working class/poor people , as if being working class is synonymous with bigotry . 
  i often wonder how the left is able to square away the fact that two of their sacred cows are in conflict with each other , how is it they are able to support mass immigration and at the same time agitate about income inequality ? 
  they really fucked you over then , my condolences . 
  my apologies , i misread . 
  he actually said that `` some '' of them belong to militants , you know like those guys with the megaphones coordinating the crowd 's attacking the hungarian border . 
  why wait for your country to have the problem 's the western european 's have before deciding to do something ? 
  quoting who ? 
  it does not read as if it is a quote , but reads more like a statement . 
  you are aware that the germans are now planning for mandatory yearly quota 's are you not ? 
  what is the end goal then ? 
  is it to stop the migrants or to make it safer for them to get into europe ? 
   germany is to push for more ambitious and extensive common european union policies on the refugee crisis , according to policymakers in berlin , with compulsory and permanent quotas for sharing the distribution of probably hundreds of thousands of people who will arrive directly from the middle east . 
  does it matter where the hundreds of thousands come from ? 
  you can start by declaring turkey a safe country and deporting anyone who crossed illegally . 
  but one was in the process of forming , now it has been reduced to '' giving a fair go an having a barbi '' . 
  how exactly are you going to move these people , especially given the fact that they have shown a willingness to engage in violence when not getting their way ? 
   and in case you did n't notice , we ca n't protect the border . 
  you ca n't protect something you are not even attempting to protect . 
   you know that is just the german constitution . 
  she can not change that . 
  especially because that is part of the german constitution that has an eternity clause . 
  did god come down and write this thing ? 
  judging by the history of the place and the general disdain for aboriginals in modern times , there has not been any place for them in australian monoculture . 
   and i personally attended a school where some classes were 28 koreans and 2 german pupils . 
  if you are at that stage already then why bother trying to make them speak german , in a few decades they will be forcing you to integrate .

   you seem to act that the actions of antifa excuses the actions of hooligans capturing the public debate . 
  antifa not hooligans . 
  americans have patriotism not nationalism . 
   and a surprise for you , there is no such a thing as australian monoculture . 
  there was one but multiculturalism has killed it , now everything is australian rendering it a meaningless distinction . 
  was n't it these very same spanish `` immigrants '' who voted against independent party 's just recently ? 
  would n't an influx of people who have no ties to the history of catalonia be detrimental to getting independence ? 
  i 'm talking about the people who put aussie flags on their car 's during public holidays . 
  i know that , i was referring to the love of protesting . 
   lower frequency of registering to vote , but more interest and knowledge about politics and more participation in protest marches and social reform groups . 
  sounds like all those hipsters in melbourne . 
   however , the resulting economic integration and military co-operation between the english and dutch navies shifted the dominance in world trade from the dutch republic to england and later to great britain . 
  no good deed goes unpunished . 
  a contender for most boring sport on the planet . 
  so you agree that australians should just let what happened to the aborigines happen to them too ? 
  i would take those over bears any day . 
  you have bears and shit in europe , the biggest predator is a dog in australia . 
   australians is not a uniform culture it was at one point , but as you have noted if anyone is now australian then what is australian ? 
   multiculturalism works there because they have civic nationalism . 
  and i have noticed a trend in the media a few years ago of trying to link civic nationalism with racism due to the fact that the majority of people who have these flag displays being white . 
  multiculturalism works in that there is only a superficial sort of community , the reality is that there is self segregation taking place . 
  did n't the same guy who did the study conclude that despite the negative effects multiculturalism was still desirable just because . 
  when they say world they really mean european country 's . 
   there used to be an implicit trust in the journalistic integrity i have long been of the opinion that the media themselves made up this myth .

  1910 , 1926 , 1974 , three coup 's are pretty radical in my opinion . 
  this is not really a good argument , the `` native americans are those who founded the various countries in america , there was no canada until the european settlers created it . 
  immigrants do n't go to poor countries , it 's because america is prosperous that people go there .

  communism is a part/byproduct of the enlightenment . 
  do they ? 
  i was under the impression that they considered themselves the heirs too the byzantine empire , i think that they tried to snatch constantinople back from the turk 's during wwi . 
  i have a different theory , namely that radical shift 's in the social and political sphere 's retard a nation 's prosperity . 
  i came across a good analogy for this , if you view a nation 's social institutions as a forest then any radical shift 's in direction is akin too deforestation .

  once they 're properly housed , the eu will distribute them amongst member states , as they 've already started to do . 
  they ca n't just head north as those countries are n't schengen countries and that would mean breaking the law . 
  in the meantime the eu is supplying help for the greek border control forces in the aegean sea to register and control migrants . 
  believe it or not the eu are n't some evil empire doing everything wrong and eurosceptic redditors are n't foreign policy experts . 
   greece also accepted help from other eu members to reinforce greek guards patrolling the aegean islands . 
   it will receive tents , generators , ambulances , water pumps , and other supplies to help house migrants and refugees . 
  goddamn eu , helping people out and stuff . 
  so which is it ? 
  the evil eu is keeping all the migrants in poor-old greece or is it * shokingly * sharing refugees equally across member countries ? 
  it seems that on this subreddit the eu is `` awful '' no matter what it does .

  soon you 'll end up spending your entire budget on buying more euros . 
  it 's a common myth spouted by eurosceptics . 
  you 're quite right about that but that does n't mean we have to stop helping greece manage its borders as they and bulgaria are the first safe countries for syrian refugees . 
  i see what you 're trying to say but this is n't a response to any particular news piece , rather a reflection on the overall topic and i 'd be interested in hearing the counterpoints , could you please allow this opinion post ? 
  a schengen border is a border of the schangen area with a non-schengen area . 
  edited for your pedantry . 
  why ? 
  should hopefully shut up the idiots claiming the largest group of migrants are n't syrians . 
  that 's wholly incorrect . 
  they can be any number of persecuted minorities . 
  so what 's your solution ? 
  exactly , which is deplorable . 
  what a fatuous comment . 
  greece has no land schengen border ? 
  please have a look at a map . 
  besides that misses the point , maritime border controls are even harder to enforce , making the need for eu co-operation even greater . 
  borders within schengen defeat its purpose . 
  the point is less bureaucracy , more transparency and bringing down the barriers to intelligence sharing when it comes to common interests . 
   a war that is n't theirs seems to be theirs when there 's arms deals and cheap oil though . 
  convenient to get rid of the kurds too . 
  like i 've said a few times now , if being anti-european means being against closer ties with fellow europeans and the formation of a european cultural entity , then yes . 
  but you wo n't understand that and this will keep going in circles . 
  lithuania can not into french, 
  yes there has apparently : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ho0n-uxbgc, 
  that 's self defeating because a british identity is part of a european one . 
  so no , your example is dishonest , ms. bearder 's is not as i 've explained before . 
  that 's asinine . 
  i do n't know what else i can say if you do n't understand my argument by now . 
  europe is not just a continent and europeans are not just inhabitants of a continent . 
  why do you demonise sex so much ? 
   with prostitution , the seller has non of the power , all of the risks whilst the buyer is usually very safe and in control . 
  only when it 's illegal . 
  that 's precisely my point , if it 's legal the sex worker has far more rights and protection than when it is not . 
   if you purchase sex , you are dehumanising another person that 's absurd . 
   you should n't have to sell your body in order to have an education . 
  that 's not what 's being implied . 
  they do n't * have * to , they just do because they have control of their bodies . 
  there 's nothing wrong with sex , mate , and the only moral actions is to provide a legal framework where people can use their bodies in as safe a way as possible . 
   sex should never be forced . 
  it 's not . 
  this entire rebuttal also misses the point that the crucial matter is harm reduction and in that sense it is perfectly analogous to recreational drug use . 
  that 's a false analogy . 
  you 're using the same argument that people that try and justify rape use , think about that . 
  take as long as you need . 
  bombing syria has worked out just fine , especially for the would be victims of isis that are still alive . 
  just a shame we did n't get to them before they buried all those women and children alive . 
  sure , and it does n't imply that they have prejudice towards other europeans . 
  what i 'm saying is if we define `` european '' as someone wanting europe to be an entity , as culturally definite as possible , then that necessarily implies that s/he will be in favour of the eu . 
  therefore it is justified to say those that are opposed to the concept of the eu , are opposed to a european identity , entity and closer co-operation ( not just economic ) and it necessarily correct to label them `` anti-european '' . 
  the issue is that no matter how much you legislate it will always end up happening , it 's not an issue of having something happen and not , rather , it 's a choice between having a legal , transparent , industry or a crime-fuelled black market . 
  just like with recreational drug use , the focus should be on harm reduction as anything else is pointless . 
  you know a significant minority of female students in the uk already sell their bodies to pay for tuition ? 
  why should their only option be to turn to crime ? 
  ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/gish_gallop ), 
  like charlie hebdo brought the terrorist attacks on themselves ? 
  enough with the victim blaming . 
  europe and nato must stand up and fight evil in a calculated manner . 
  well said . 
  that 's why i find it incomprehensible that tsiparas rejects eu support for border controls . 
  if anything it 's irresponsible and he should n't have the choice as it affects everyone in the eu , not just the small greek population . 
  that 's absolutely asinine . 
  those that are proactive ( like alde members ) work like madmen , i 'd agree with that statement if it was about ukip meps , who do sweet fuck all but have the nerve to claim wages . 
  in the sense that they are against further european integration , like i just said , yes . 
  that 's tautological . 
  russian and turkish governments fucking things up for europeans as usual . 
  so what are you saying ? 
  keep them in germany , i do n't want anything to do with them ? 
  these are really good questions , shame she did n't answer them . 
  i can answer one for you though . 
   are you in favor of federalization ? 
  alde and the ld 's are fervent advocates of federalisation , so i would think it safe to assume she is too . 
   whilst also criminalising the purchase of sex i will never understand this . 
  it will always happen and i do n't see anything immoral about it . 
   i believe people will judge me on my record and the work i have done really ? 
  do n't you think that 's a bit na\u00efve ? 
  i identify as a liberal too but i think people in the uk ( or in most countries , really ) wo n't vote based on your track record , rather on what the media says about your party , i.e. 
  `` tuition fees '' and nothing else . 
  most people in the uk do n't even know what meps do . 
  i would argue they are , they 're against further european interconnection , not necessarily against europeans as people . 
  taking in refugees . 
  i agree we should be bombing isis too . 
  you ca n't possibly say turkey is doing enough though , the turkish government has been caught supplying isis , denied the us from using its bases , being entirely inactive in the whole conflict despite isis having turkish hostages , etc. 
  appalling from what is meant to be a local `` moderator '' with a big armed force .

  stop being a stupid commie . 
  was that a fight ? 
  all i saw was a bunch of men groping each other , if they had took their clothes off i 'd say it was some very weird porn . 
  i would n't say i 'm proud of them though i perfectly understand them and probably would do the same in their position , only an idiot would pay more taxes if he could get away with paying less . 
   you have introduced the fallacy of the excluded middle .

   it 's also fine that they 're mad about it and try to get rid of the bad pr . 
  no , i 'm not going to switch to yahoo !,

   it 's like the old joke ' a plane crashes on the border of france and germany . 
  where do you bury the survivors ? ' . 
  i do n't know this old joke . 
   you know ... it 's not the first time that the rest of europe has to nod to germany , this shit country with shit nazi people is once again on their way to ruin europe . 
  sick of these people i 'm sorry but got to get it off my chest 1/10, 
   you are spot on . 
  it 's the game we play that reinforces this kinds of behaviour . 
  the game has a name though . 
  google 's ceo is right , it 's called capitalism . 
  if only we abolished capitalism , we 'd be able to get google to pay its fair share of taxes . 
  we 'd also destroy google in the process and end up not taxing a dime , but i 'm with you - communism good , capitalism bad . 
  greed gets people lobbying the government for higher benefits and lower taxes as if the government could spend more than what it taxes . 
  while i do agree with you that the market should be liberalised , when you say things like this :  the single market has a value as well as a price , right now the price is increasing rapidly ... ... . you know you 're not serious , the benefit of being inside the single market far outweighs what you have to pay . 
  sure , you 're free to leave , though nobody is really bothered about that because if you did , you 'd only be shooting yourselves in the foot . 
  i do appreciate it that the british are in though , both the eu and the uk benefit from it and you still are very much in favour of non-interventionism in the economy , it helps in minimizing the french `` muh government spending '' which is extra awful when they try to impose it on an european level . 
   this coming from a clearly racist right winger . 
  you people can check his history . 
   the freedom is much less than it appear on its face , it 's mostly about shipping around worker drones to maintain high unemployment and keep down wage demands . 
  we need far more focus on the needs of workers and smes and far less on the needs of transnational corporations and investors . 
  lol communist, 
   british prime minister david cameron ruffled feathers across the channel earlier this year when he said he would `` roll out the red carpet '' for french residents trying to avoid the top tax rate . 
  see ? 
  the french fucking up their tax rates and their economy wo n't be so bad after all - the belgians , the british and the swiss certainly do n't seem so upset by these retarded french socialist policies !, 
   well , the ft is consistent at least . 
  people like you are also stubborn so it kinda evens out . 
   yeah , i think we can all agree that post wwii germany and france are fascist , because they do n't allow nazi propaganda . 
  also , almost all western european countries are fascist , because they do n't allow incitement to violence , or hate speech . 
  what about my free speech in calling for niggers to be killed ? 
  too bad this is the internet , anyone can say anything that it 's all anonymous and nobody 's opinions will have any impact in real life . 
  you trying to ban from reddit a guy in his basement from saying on the internet `` too bad breivik did n't kill you , motherfucker '' because a guy who 's not a nobody would be punished if he said * insert minority group * out loud in public is retarded . 
  if you 're offended , fucking grow up . 
   i suggest they be banned . 
  in the meantime , i suggest you be banned because only a fascist would want to censor the opinions of those he disagrees with and i personally feel offended that bobble413 , the fascist , is actively trying to impose censorship in r/europe . 
   yeah , right , so ' i would like to leave the eu , because it is overly bureaucratic ' is equivalent to ` too bad breivik did n't kill you , motherfucker ' . 
  yeah , nice job portraying the eurosceptics as all polite and trying to actually discuss the policies rather than just shitting on the eu and the guys against immigration as all assholes who 'd gun down every untermensch if they could . 
  if you disagree with them , downvote , ignore and move on , do n't fucking bitch to the mods . 
  i for one think it 's actually funny to have some trolls around , i sometimes even upvote them because of how people like you get pissed , [ deal with it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hx9r2.png ) . 
   nothing will be done like usual , it took months for the mods to do something to the likes of txampion that kept spewing racist bullshit on every thread . 
  what 's your problem with txampion ? 
  in both cases , we 're arguing for mod censorship of content we fully disagree with under the pretence that the people who post such content only talk about one issue and sometimes insults those who disagree with them . 
  be it the guy who only talks about immigration policy and how muslims are shit ( like beanfart ) , the guy who only talks about the uk 's relationship with europe and how europhiles are shit ( like al_gorithm ) or like the guy who only talks about the economy and how communists are shit ( like me ) . 
  i also disagree with al_gorithm 's stance on uk-eu 's relationship , can someone ban him so that i do n't get offended ? 
   i never said she was following the wrong policy , just that i do n't like her as a chancellor and would prefer a red/green coalition . 
  i 'm sorry for bothering you but i do n't understand why . 
  we seem to agree on everything ( i for one do n't ever recall disagreeing with any of your posts , which is insane ) and now you 're telling me cdu/csu/fdp are doing a worse job than spd/greens would . . considering that you 're german and i 'm not , i want to know why . 
  when i 'm discussing these politics , i often find myself defend the german position and the way your country handling of the situation , but if even you think the centre-left spd would handle this better than centre-right cdu and merkel , well , maybe i 'm wrong , maybe there 's more to it . 
  in what way the red/green coalition in germany would be better for europe ? 
  you 're right , but i still fail to realise how merkel is following a wrong policy whereas the spd and the greens would have performed better , at least in regards to the handling of the current eu problems . 
   really ? 
  evolution ? 
  exodus from africa ?

  it seems i 'll have to wait till the next `` like and share a picture of this dying kid and facebook will donate 0.10 $ for his recovery '' campaign to be charitable . 
   what does ` native ' mean ? 
  you could say there are no native europeans and we 're all immigrants from africa . 
  it 's only a matter of time scale . 
  til nobody is a native , we 're all african immigrants .

  `` malucos do riso '', 
   greece and portugal hate on her because they think she embodies the eu . 
  they forget that other countries pay for them too , and also demand austerity as well . 
  nope , we do n't hate them . 
  this is what we think of her :  she is competent , intelligent and at least tries to act like she has integrity . 
  which is more than can be said about most politicians . 
  please do n't confuse what a loud minority here says with the overall public opinion in portugal or greece or wherever , it 's obvious that the communists and the syndicalists now are getting pissed since public spending is being cut but that does n't mean we hate on anyone , specially on people who had nothing to do with us getting into this position . 
   germany you should be ashamed for voting for this absolute wretch of a woman , she looks more sloth than human . 
  you obviously do n't know how to appreciate a mature woman . 
   the preferred coalition partner of the spd are the greens , which would be the only realistic way to get rid of her .

  what 's the source for this ?

  we are/were still using small coastal ships from the colonial war , but we got some second hand ones from denmark in a real nice deal now which i think are/were being refitted . 
  we complain a lot about money being spent in anything and the leftmost parties which are anti-nato ( just on principle , on practical terms , not doing anything about it ) more , but we are not idiots in geopolitics to think we can not have armed forces . 
  btw having a functional navy was very handy the one time spain tried to dump a desintegrating oil tanker into portuguese waters . 
  it \u00b4 s probably a good deal for both countries . 
  we received lots of those from the us as a deal as part of the lease of lajes field , and kind of needed to cut the number to half ( the one airbase where the f-16s are stationed , the f-16 flight envelope from there covers everywhere where about 90 % of the portuguese population lives ) . 
  and the portuguese air force maintenance historically has been good and serious ( they can \u00b4 t do miracles with the c-130 though ) so i doubt romania is getting cheated . 
  you should see the face on some foreign friends who were staying longterm and asking me mid october when was the heating system going to be turned on and me explaining there was none . 
  and yeah , the esquentador is just to heat tap water . 
  or foreigns who manage to find a ( expensive ) house with central heating ( more usual in the north ) and innocently turn it on and leave it on all day , every day and then get the bill and find out why most home buyers do not bother looking for or putting on central heating . 
  does that happen in portugal ? 
  it \u00b4 s been 17 to 30 lately , and i love it . 
  it \u00b4 s bad oil reserves . 
  she had a point about the fish . 
  for an island , you really don \u00b4 t know what to do with it . 
  i don \u00b4 t know how they define `` upper secondary education '' . 
  past 10th grade , all students in some areas will only have one foreign language , but all those people ~ ( dodging math-a ) ~ taking humanities will surely have one language ( ok , english ) + one more and can \u00b4 t quite believe they are only 7 % . 
  ok , which island of theirs do they propose we use ? 
  because it \u00b4 s probably not that much money to spare , and notice how that is a selling point . 
  300 thousand euros , returned is meant to tempt people rich enough to be able to travel and live in europe but not rich enough to already be able to invest in property or business . 
  for example in portugal you got to buy a property worth half a million , and then need to wait , and provide declarations of this and that with absolutely no guarantee they would ever achieve citizenship . 
  this `` you don \u00b4 t even need to live in hungary '' bid is meant as kind of a race to the bottom , to reach those with money but a lot less money . 
  like in all races to the bottom between eu nations , probably not a good idea . 
  it \u00b4 s also seriously misleading if not actually outright lying , in details like acess to universities . 
  residence permit does not give acess to eu - citizen university fees . 
  life long visa free entrance to bond holder and their family for the schengen zone countries also does not make much sense as a believable promise , as far as i can tell that is not how schengen visas work and hungary can \u00b4 t promise this for life . 
   how 's it possible that romania gets less than portugal ? 
  it \u00b4 s per capita , per million . 
  romania \u00b4 s population is twice as much so they get 11 * 20 = 220 and portugal gets 15 * 10 = 150 , romania still gets a bit more . 
   funny that obama just praised portugal on the un about receiving refugees , not our fault . 
  they run away . 
  is it correct about the lower university fees ? 
  isn \u00b4 t that just for citizens of an eu nation , not legal residents ? 
  the president is a university professor , one which was famously tough and popular ( both ) with his students , so i guess he is used to young people who have not prepared as well was they could have ... 
  the guy in that game france played against ireland 7 years ago ? 
  ( what a lame excuse , a supposed hand what 2 minutes before a goal , and not on the penalty area ?

  that was actually shocking . 
  i thought maybe they had 3000 and decided they could only spare 1000 . we got about 300 wolves in portugal , maybe 2000 in whole in the iberian peninsula . 
  the iberian peninsula is just about 20 % larger than norway and has 10 times the population , and maybe 30 time the number of wolves . 
  how much bother can 68 wolves be in a country that big ? 
  so they eat a few sheep , happens , make a fund to pay farmers for it . 
  i hope he really likes china , because that is how you end up having no friends with money or weapons ... 
  not really . 
  maybe in western europe , but not all gypsies are roma , at least our locally do not identify as such and call them selves ciganos and not romani or roma ( and often they really don \u00b4 t like the eastern european roma gypsies which they call just romanians even if they are not ), 
   [ question for all ] how common is hitchhiking in your country ? 
  not common . 
  i think it comes from a time where people knew each other \u00b4 s lives and always knew who was going to go where and would ask for rides in advance . 
  just standing in the middle of the road asking strangers , dunno , i see ocasionally people do it , mostly foreigners but i would not stop and block traffic and risk not liking the person after all . 
  i think you will be lots luckier asking in a caf\u00e9 or something , not on the road . 
  the other day i saw two young cute foreign girls kneeling with a sign just past a traffic light asking for a hitchhike right on the acess to the main lisbon-porto highway ( the access of the airport fireman house ) which was so incredibly dangerous on all levels , i was so mad because i nearly did not see them ( kneeling ! ), 
  and had to swerve right fast . 
  assholes . 
  also , the smell . 
  a lot of ^ ( mostly foreign ) people , particularly if hitchhiking do not bathe enough and smell and would not want to be sitting next to them for any length of time . 
  we got wolf dogs , and actually they kept the job , maybe with more subsidies now http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-16845256 they look like this http://lobo.fc.ul.pt/caodegado/castro-laboreiro.html or this http://lobo.fc.ul.pt/caodegado/serra-estrela.html the wolves are not very large though , it \u00b4 s a climate thing , the warmer the weather the smaller the species . 
  they probably got a sticker label in local language which might not call it necessarily chocolate but something else . 
  reese \u00b4 s peanut butter stuff shows up a lot here , not the most popular sweets but implanting itself through supermarket promos and so on . 
  i like peanut everything , including peanut butter chocolate and i like those . 
  we also have peanut butter mini magnum icecreams which are just great and special limited edition ( but they keep pushing it every two months or so , so not so limited ) peanut butter oreos which are just awesome and the best oreos . 
  peanut butter is not used a lot as a spread by itself but peanuts are pretty popular anyway . 
  peanut curry is a big favorite of mine ...

  first day is a holiday . 
  supposedly days of the week have been continuously named for a very long time . 
  we have had calendar skips , gregorian correction happened but they kept the week days . 
  and even in religion , notice how easter would make no sense if sunday was the seventh day , or why jews observe the shabbath on saturday ( obviously , it \u00b4 s the name , it \u00b4 s the right day ) . 
  it \u00b4 s weird some protestants trying to transfer old jewish observances of saturday into sunday . 
  it does not really mean feira , it just coincides with the name . 
  it cames from feria , the latin in the liturgical calendar , meaning mostly day https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/feria, 
  no first day . 
  just 2nd to 6th , the 1st and 7th day got special names . 
  and half of europe seems to number the days of the week also , but doing it differently . 
  greeks are ok though . 
  i kind of wonder what hebrew week day names are , off to the wikipedia now to check . 
  of course there is good reason to think his wife was an ilegal immigrant - by her own admission she needed to keep flying out of the usa to get her visa renewed which by some experts ( also as its done here ) probably means she was not staying with a visa which allowed work . 
  which makes sense if you are giving an immigrant the right to work you are not going to make them leave the country periodically . 
  also the date of the green card through marriage is interesting , her statements are she got it 4 or 5 years before her public wedding with trump . 
  if you think hillary mishandling her private mail is in any way as morally wrong as say trump university that is certainly not my opinion . 
  if you think trump is more competent than hillary in general just look at how their campaigns are being run - the communications missteps , the third campaign manager , the expenses , the no ads or campaign offices . 
  the `` doctor 's '' letter for goodness sake , do you think it was competent to release that letter ? 
  the plagiarized wife 's speech which nobody checked ? 
  ( with a rick rolling even ! ), 
  if we have heard of trump 's email might be significative indeed . 
  but considering all signs of incompetency in his campaign and businesses ( how many bankruptcies ? ), 
  i would not consider it a sign of better practices . 
  just that he is not the target for these people . 
  and that is becoming more and more conspicuous and is extremely interesting . 
  worse than hitler ? 
  pol pot ? 
  sure . 
  been around reddit enough to have heard that one before .

  in reality , no . 
  i think we 've passed the proper window frame for it and the divergences are now plenty and wide . 
  the track sheet of fuckups is kilometers long and is shared by all governments and the eu itself . 
  the populations political views are now too far apart , not to mention the general opinion each one has over the other . 
  there is just too much diversity to create a strong pan-european identity and make it function under a common law , fiscal , security ( police/military ) system . 
  even if were n't a centralized political system but with highly autonomous region states . 
  there are also political factions devoted to exploring and seeding anti-european sentiment and they would never allow a federalization , actively destabilizing it . 
  and if we mention that it goes against the interests of the global corporatocracy , then it definitely has no chance . 
  i can imagine it could work out in it 's beginning , from the need to overcome some extreme problem , like the currency failure we 're experiencing , but at the minimum amount of later problems there would be great strife and unbearable noise from all over . 
  solidarity and mutual trust has long sailed from these waters . 
  we 've actually been giving energy to spain . 
  i seriously doubt germany france or norway would give their energy to anyone . 
  he speaks of european union of utopia . 
  an enchanted and fabled place where everything and everyone agree and benefit from . 
  it 's just not feasible . 
  it never was feasible in the us and it most definitely never will be in old europe . 
  the pesticides weaken the bees immune system . 
  that is scientifically proven . 
  in the same way that nobody dies of hiv/aids , but from other common illnesses now lethal to a weak immune systems . 
  i hope you use those arguing skills and stubborn skepticism to haggle those insanely high prices that are coming to the supermarkets . 
  i 'm convinced these corporations are the cause of the problem and will even try to make an even higher profit by coming up with artificial pollinators . 
  win-win is how they see it , given the power they have . 
  i for one , do not welcome our teutonic overlords . 
  what good is free trade compared to the amount of debt and disagreeance between countries ? 
  when the euro fails and germany throws in the towel , the eu is no more . 
  mirrors , please . 
  i seriously doubt the portuguese rank . 
  it must be based on old pre-austerity data . 
  i have two children and things are insanely hostile to parents . 
  not to mention the drastic cuts in state support and rising costs of vat and everything childcare related . 
  beautiful women . 
  low prices . 
  interesting culture . 
  better economic growth perspectives . 
  lower taxes . 
  some people prefer winter to summer . 
  `` most politicians are either deist , agnostic , or aitheist . '', 
  so they 're basically anyone in terms of religion or lack of . 
  very insightful . 
  at least you acknowledge the problem of sponsored radicalization and money laundering . 
  i agree , muslim will favor muslims , specially if it hurts other faction non-muslim factions . 
  welcome to the muslim middle ages . 
  albanians in kosovo did a ethnic cleansing of serbs . 
  you may not know about because of all the senseless hatred being pitched over the media . 
  you see , nato and the un needed a good strong scapegoat to justify a profitable war and at the same time appease the muslim community . 
  serbs were fit for the part . 
  albanians and muslims in particular are oppressed everywhere !, 
  if you put them in sweden or norway , they 'll still feel oppressed . 
  their culture derives from gratuitous antagonism and victimization . 
  it 's been working so far , why should stop ? 
  what incentive is there to stop their antics and adopt modern civilization ? 
  the get away with so much by being like this . 
  it requires so little effort . 
  you need to catch up on history and have a lesson on empathy . 
  put yourself in serbian shoes . 
  see ~ ~ degenerate thugs ~ ~ ( does n't matter the ethnicity , only what they bring with them and their occupying goals ) swarming your country like an infestation . 
  all you can do about it will result in further serbian loss . 
  germany and france would lose their shit if it was happening there . 
  france !, 
  the same country that deported gypsies ... hypocrites . 
  do n't think they 'll stop there . 
  this will only end with serbia wiped off the map . 
  kosovo is a mafia state . 
  it is also an islamic nation , so no wonder those countries support them . 
  letting kosovo in on the eu will mean a massive security breach . 
  their main exports are thuggery , crime and terrorism . 
  if they are poor and have shitty infrastructure then by all means they should leave and return kosovo to the serbs . 
  and stop being a hypocrite . 
  if this were happening in central europe , it would be a handled much to the opposite . 
  i 'm amazed all the propaganda and hate campaigns against serbs , while completely denying the horrors perpetrated by other balkan factions , particularly the muslims and croats . 
  by favoring these you 're alienating the serbs and asking for another genocide . 
  serbs are human too . 
  fair . 
  yes fuck them all . 
  but most judges in that high court have way too much power and they never rule/vote the same . 
  they seem to obey the party discipline vote instead of the country 's interests . 
  it 's rotten . 
  portuguese democracy is a putrid corpse from which international financial vultures and well dressed maggots have all been feeding from . 
  soon , all that will be left are the bones ... to be grinded and served as a last supper . 
  a beggars feast !, 
  but i agree , austerity imposed unfairly , on the weak and middle class was bound to be unconstitutional . 
  they do n't dare affront the powerful lobbies and wealthy , or even tell the international loan sharks to fuck off . 
  we 'll be thrown out quite soon . 
  hopefully just before all hell breaks loose in bigger countries . 
  i also hope the eu members know this and much worse is whats coming for them . 
  we were just the initial cracks in the rift that is the eu . 
  finally , an end to decades of `` amateur night '' politics !, 
  serbs know they 'll never get it back . 
  but the last laugh will be theirs , when islamic separatist republics start popping up across europe . 
  rust in peace , iron lady . 
  how sad is that ? 
  in a couple of decades or so , they 'll own and occupy most of europe . 
  with support from the local community ? 
  no it doens ` t. 
  not to the extent it does with sharia . 
  besides , what women are intimidated or threatened by their catholic neighbours ? 
  sure , they cab be frowned upon but not beaten within an inch of their lifes , thrown acid at or raped . 
  nor do they get told to be silent or face death or the death of their children . 
  radical islam is a monstrosity and you 're just abetting these thugs . 
  no luck in natural resources and half the year , there 's a blazing heat discouraging any kind of heavy work .

  it seems you 're not being austere enough , how difficult is it to sharply cut public spending and also public revenue ? 
  it 's not a free lunch you get from the government , you know , for them to spend money on you they must first tax money from you , at the end of the day you 're just giving away money for those who lobby the best and for those who work within the system . 
   i say this as a citizen of a country that has fired teachers , but it 's seeking the olympic games . 
  it seems to me your democratically elected politicians have their priorities completely screwed up . 
  i just do n't understand how one can blame germany or a market free from government intervention in any of this . 
   and they want to make deregulate the jobs market more . 
  [ labour freedom ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pxpkhoe.png ) in portugal and in switzerland - ( [ source ] ( http://www.heritage.org/index/ ) ) [ unemployment rate ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m3afau7.png ) in portugal and in switzerland - ( [ source ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ ) ) see any correlation ? 
   the solution for every problem is more profits . 
  the cause for the spanish unemployment rate over 25 % is indeed an highly restrictive labour market and the solution is liberalisation . 
  sure , you can reduce unemployment by digging ditches and filling them back up but that would n't create any value to society , if you want actual wealth , you must not restrict the market . 
  one does n't even need to look at switzerland to understand that . 
   we mostly respect germany for not failing as we have done , but also hate it for asking the government to cut so many social benefits . 
  that 's no reason to hate anybody , you 're free to keep as many social benefits as you want . 
  they 'll probably just stop lending you their money , that will be about it . 
   we hate them for being our bosses again , spain and every other country can at any time leave the eu and refuse any loans by germany or any other country . 
  to blame them for the shit spanish politicians accomplish is outright dishonest . 
   frankly i think this is totally justified , she has been one of the most ardent supporters of a policy that has quite proven not to work already . 
  it 's either austerity or bankruptcy . 
   why germans continue to vote for her is confusing to me . 
  because they rather not vote for populist scoundrels like we did and rather not go the way of portugal , spain and greece . 
   syria is a giant mess . 
  pretty much all of the middle east is a massive cluster-fuck . 
  since you also find these issues interesting , [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yanhk4pce ) 's a great three-part vice documentary about egypt after morsi . 
  you do raise valid points though i 'm not sure if actual intervention will achieve anything meaningful . 
  and even from france 's perspective , war is quite unpopular and expensive , i do n't know if they 're willing to go on ahead despite countries like the uk backing down from actual military action . 
   they were n't eager to go back . 
  what makes you think they 're eager to go back into syria ? 
  popular opinion is clearly against it and they already got entangled in libya and mali . 
   france has a very long history of getting involved in the affairs of its former colonies . 
  this is just something that they do . 
  what about the vietnam war ? 
   if we did there would be riots nationwide . 
  considering the riots you did n't have with regards to the wars in iraq , afghanistan and libya and also concerning the transgressions the us government has been committing recently , i really doubt that statement . 
  that anthony bourdain video was probably the most depressing video ever , what a bunch of nonsense , so they hate some crappy crab in some shacks and some socialists whined and moaned about the country , how shitty . 
  you should see anthony bourdain in brazil or in other countries where they have it much worse and yet they all have a good time there . 
  ca n't say i 'm too surprised . 
   ich bin ein berliner no , for fuck sake , please do n't post that nonsense populist bullshit . 
  [ thread to that video right here on r/europe ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/130m3k/portugal_vs_germany_taxes_and_more/?limit=500 )  ended up being banned from public exhibition in germany . 
  not true , it was simply not allowed to be shown in an outdoor somewhere . 
  who gives a fuck ? 
   chemical weapons are far more serious than conventional weapons it 's seems to me you 're belittling the pain and suffering that conventional weapons can cause . 
  with a google search you 'll find plenty of videos from syria with people with their limbs blown off , women bleeding to death and maimed children . . if we ignore this and only react when chemical weapons are used i 'd say we have a pretty fucked up moral compass . 
   if assad decided to use his chemical weapons more liberally tens of thousands would die in a matter of days . 
  and if he continues to use conventional weapons , tens of thousands will continue to suffer and die in a matter of months . 
  and the same can be said about the rebels or a potential un-lead invasion . 
   so that means we should n't even attempt anything ? 
  attempt what ? 
  you 're the one advocating action , what kind of action exactly ? 
   but when civilians are being killed with poison gas a matter of miles away from our borders we 're supposed to sit on our hands ? 
  what does it matter that it 's with poison gas ? 
  is killing with conventional weapons ok now ? 
  and what about the rebels who are also executing and beheading people not even affiliated with al-asad 's regime ? 
  and how exactly will you improve the life of the syrian people , will it be with bombings or with troops on the ground ? 
  the way you 're talking it 's as if this was a white and black issue when it 's all just different shades of grey . 
    ft.com articles are only available to registered users   great . 
  here , to avoid the pay-wall :  us , france and britain gear up for cruise missile strike on syria   the us , britain and france are pressing ahead with plans for a 48-hour cruise missile attack on selected syrian military assets at the end of this week , amid signs that financial markets are becoming nervous over the heightened tension in the region . 
    as syria vowed on tuesday to use `` all means available '' to counter a us-led assault on president bashar al-assad 's regime , western officials said their defence chiefs would deploy sea-launched cruise missiles to attack syria . 
  officials said they would not be targeting suspected chemical weapons locations but a limited range of air force and army sites . 
    david cameron , the uk prime minister , and french president fran\u00e7ois hollande will convene their governments ' national security councils to help finalise plans for the attack . 
  mr cameron recalled parliament for a debate on the matter on thursday . 
    the us said it would soon publish new intelligence information on last week 's chemical weapons attack in eastern damascus that would point to the assad regime 's guilt . 
  the attack prompted the drive for military action . 
    oil prices rose sharply higher and share prices tumbled globally in volatile trading on tuesday as momentum built for military action . 
  the price of benchmark brent oil jumped 3.3 per cent to a six-month high of $ 114.35 a barrel -- the sharpest daily rise this year . 
  the ftse all-world share index dropped 1.4 per cent to close at its lowest since early july . 
  the s&p 500 was down 1.42 per cent . 
    wall street 's `` fear gauge '' , the cboe vix index , which measures expectations of stock market volatility , hit a two-month high . 
    western states advocating intervention were given important support from the arab league , which blamed mr assad for the damascus assault that killed more than 300 people . 
    a statement issued after a meeting of the league 's permanent representatives gave no evidence to support its conclusion and made no mention of military action . 
  but the league held syria `` fully responsible for the ugly crime and demands that all the perpetrators of this heinous crime be presented for international trials '' . 
    walid muallem , syria 's foreign minister , denied damascus was responsible for last week 's attack and on tuesday challenged the west to prove its allegations . 
    `` if they have any evidence of our use [ of such weapons ] , i challenge them to show this evidence to [ global ] public opinion , '' he said at a press conference in damascus . 
  `` it 's the right of public opinion to know the truth of these allegations . ''   chuck hagel , us defence secretary , said in a bbc interview on tuesday that the us military was `` ready to go '' if president barack obama gave the order to attack . 
  `` we have moved assets in place to be able to fulfil and comply with whatever option the president wishes to take , '' mr hagel said . 
    the obama administration has continued to build support at home and abroad for an attack , emphasising that such action would be short , lasting perhaps two to three days , and designed solely as a response to the use of chemical weapons , not an intervention in the civil war . 
    mr obama has spoken to the leaders of the uk , france , canada and australia . 
  white house officials have also briefed congressional chiefs , with no substantive pushback so far from either republican or democratic leaders on capitol hill . 
  congressional leaders have demanded the white house consult them fully , a form of words which underlines they are not insisting congress vote on and approve any strike . 
    mr hollande said france was `` ready to punish those who took the appalling decision to gas innocents '' , echoing us and uk opinion when he said that such a violation of international law provided sufficient legal justification for intervention . 
    stephen harper , canada 's prime minister , agreed that the use of chemical weapons in syria merited a firm international response , a spokesman for mr harper said . 
    italy , however , said it would only support military action authorised by the un security council . 
  emma bonino , foreign minister , told parliament : `` italy will not take active part in any military action . 
  beyond the context of the security council , which for us is and remains the only point of legal reference that can not be ignored . ''   russia and china have repeatedly used their security council vetoes to block un action against damascus . 
  on tuesday they warned strongly against a western-led strike on syria in response to the alleged use of chemical weapons , arguing it would be dangerous , irresponsible and could have `` catastrophic consequences '' . 
    mixed signals came out of iran , a longtime syria ally . 
  hassan rohani , the new president , tweeted on tuesday : `` we completely and strongly condemn [ the ] use of chemical weapons in syria '' , adding that the international community should `` use all its might to prevent use of chemical weapons anywhere in the world , especially in syria '' . 
    mohammad-javad zarif , the foreign minister , urged western countries to avoid `` hasty decision-making '' about syria , warning military action could worsen the situation . 
  however , in a phone conversation with his german counterpart , guido westerwelle , on tuesday , mr zarif condemned the use of chemical weapons in syria and called for the `` finalisation of [ the ] un investigation in this regard '' . 
    but abbas araghchi , a foreign ministry spokesman , warned against any attack , saying it would have `` dangerous ramifications and serious consequences for the region '' . 
    un weapons inspectors in syria on tuesday postponed a visit to a site of last week 's alleged chemical weapons attack because of security fears . 
  `` considering the complexities of the site , confirmation of access has not been obtained , '' a statement said , adding that approval was expected later in the day . 
    the un team 's convoy was shot at on monday as it sought to enter the town of mouadamiyah in the ghouta region ringing the capital , to which inspectors later returned . 
    one of the factors holding the us back from military intervention has been divisions within the syrian opposition . 
  according to reuters , opposition officials have been meeting us and western envoys in istanbul and been told to prepare for negotiations on transition . 
    `` the americans want to know that we are ready to deal with the consequences of such a strike , '' said najib ghadbian , a member of the main opposition umbrella group the syrian national coalition . 
    another official from the group said emails were being circulated within the coalition asking if there was a plan in the event of a strike triggering regime collapse , suggesting the opposition still has some way to go in its preparations . 
   on one hand , portugal needed some of this infrastructure back then ( tr\u00e1s-os-montes had terrible roads ) . 
  yes , and now it has plenty of unused roads . 
  sure , it 's fine and dandy when i go to my village and i can drive for some 30min without finding any single car on the highway ( either on the side i 'm going or on the other side ) but the massive expense that went for this wo n't in 100 years have any positive returns . 
  oh , and when i was a kid i still could go to tr\u00e1s-os-montes , sure , the roads were shittier and i 'd often get sick from driving around the mountains and it was always turning , but so what , at least then we were n't all some thousands of euros poorer because there were n't highways everywhere .

  i gave arguments why they did . 
  you gave me arguments about shit i did not say . 
  so you claim poland did not exist using the justification of international law , and now you say it is the least important aspect ? 
  even though you also ignore the fact that they had an actual army , territories under their control at several points of the occupation , and again , a united ethnic group and national consciousness , which remained even under occupation , with their own newspapers , radios , and government offices ( in occupied poland ) . 
  are these all lies , or can you explain what is the most important aspect then ? 
  it apparently is not de jure factors , nor army , nor people , nor territory . 
  am i missing some obscure factor ? 
  `` the was de facto no polish state from 1939-1945 as a point of international law . '', 
  the international community recognized the continued and legitimate existence of the government in exile and of the resistance army , so that is simply not true . 
  there was a resistance government . 
  there was a internationally recognized government in exile . 
  there was an occupation government . 
  there was a polish army operating in guerrilla warfare . 
  there was a polish civil society , language , and ethnicity still in the territory . 
  there was a geographical place which most of the world still referred to as `` poland '' . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're claiming it did n't exist . 
  it does n't really . 
  if the polish resistance had death camps for nazi prisoners , what would it be , then ? 
  resistance governments ( and government-in-exile ) , people , and territory remained there . 
  the occupation was also not recognized by allied governments . 
  under many de facto and de jure views , poland did not cease to exist . 
  i used romanian trains quite a bit , and except for the bathrooms did n't seem so shitty like this ( used intercity and the night train ) . 
  their main problem is just slow . 
  baia mare to brasov alone is like 12 hours ( for 400km ) , which was agonizing . 
  besides that it does not seem so bad . 
  the view through ardeal and the mountains is 10/10 though , would recommend . 
  no clue about commuter trains though . 
  note that in the netherlands it 's not always possible . 
  many towns have specific `` koopzondag '' days where you can indeed shop on sunday , but in many places they are only once or twice a month ( usually last sunday ) . 
  so while you can indeed shop , check the koopzondag calendar first . 
  homophobia , misogyny , application of religious law at a national scale , to the detriment of individual rights and secularism . 
  those are all possible for christian extremism . 
  where is he getting those percentages from ? 
  in portugal it is viewed somewhat negatively . 
  we were in the midst of a very unstable series of governments ( some lasting only days !, 
  ) , of economic crisis , and of hunger , and then we send in a hundred thousand boys , with no training , or even weapons or transport ( they were sent to flanders in english and french ships , and given english rifles ) . 
  unlike every other army in the front , they did not rotate , so they stayed for a year in the trenches , while british and french armies rotated their units every couple of weeks . 
  then , our tired , demoralized , under-trained corps suffered the largest military defeat in 500 years against the germans at la lys . 
  what a trainwreck . 
  it is generally considered a mistake that we joined in . 
  i think the main justification was that it was to defend our african colonies , as the british were vying them , and we needed to join their side to dissuade them , but that is disputed . 
  is it because it includes all eu languages , or is it all english ? 
   because they were actualy invaded by a hostile force - georgia . 
   the \u010ce\u010dnian forces were recognized by un securety council to be terrorists . 
  so chechnia is not okay , because the un said they were terrorists . 
  but the un also recognized georgian , moldovan , and ukrainian sovereignty over their territories , which you claim they `` invaded '' . 
  so which is it ? 
   gerorgia invaded 2 independant countries under russian protection . 
  russia simply drove the fascists back and tha reastablished pre war borders . 
  if russian troops in those countries is oaky , why is it bad to send nato troops to other independent countries ? 
  would it also be okay for american troops to go to chechnya defend it ? 
   lol no are you that retarded ? 
  that is literally what is happening . 
  that is the point of the article , that is what poland has been asking for for the last 3 years . 
   you have a flawed view of democracy , and if the goverment had formed out of parties oposing nato it would be an anti nato goverment , it just didnt form like that . 
  then the slovenian people are not against nato , and your bellyaching about it is a minority view . 
   sending loads of hostile troops to russias borders is provocation since its aiming weapons at them . 
  especialy since nato is know for hostile acts . 
  imagine you are estonia . 
  you see russia literally invading georgia . 
  then , a few years later , it invades crimeia , and sends troops to donbass . 
  you see that you have a quite large russian minority , and that russia invaded both countries with impunity . 
  you call your allies to send some troops to avoid the same fate . 
  how is this any provocation ? 
  do you think estonia wants to invade russia ? 
  do you think lithuania is going to annex the pskov region or something ? 
  they are afraid , because their neighbor has showed aggression and has annexed other countries territories . 
  if you do not understand their perspective then why do you even discuss it with such assumptions ? 
   wrong russia invaded and occupied georgian territories in 2008 . 
  russia has an illegal military presence in moldova since 1991 . 
  russia has annexed ukrainian territory in 2014 , and has military presence there still . 
  do you just not read the news , or do you still live in 1989 ? 
  slovenia is bound by a treaty it signed . 
  by its government . 
  who was elected . 
  by you . 
  if the leading party has nothing about nato , it probably means it accepts the current condition ( staying in nato ) . 
  so , again , if slovenians are so against it , they would vote for an anti-nato party . 
  as that did not happen , the slovenian nation thus supports nato , or is at least indifferent to slovenian participation . 
  all of this is irrelevant to the main point however , which was `` why is this a provocation ? '', 
  russia invaded some neighbors , other neighbors are afraid , and bolster their defenses in response . 
  why , again , is this provocation ? 
  use actual arguments please , not `` oh boo hoo usa are nazis '', 
  the government is elected by its people . 
  if pro-eu and pro-nato parties are elected , then it is only by the choice of the slovenian people . 
  neither of those points have anything to do with this topic . 
  it is not slovenia that is receiving the extra troops , so , again , what is your problem ? 
  if , on the other hand , slovenia is indeed sending troops to protect poland and estonia , maybe you 're not so pro-russian after all , heh ? 
  1 - not sure what the usa has to do with it , please avoid whataboutism . 
  if usa neighbors or other countries feel threatened by it , it is their choice to bolster their defenses . 
  the issue here is that eastern european countries feel threatened by russia , and wish to further their defenses , what does the usa have to do with this ? 
  2 - what does that even mean ? 
  the allies are coming to these countries because the local governments requested it , what is the issue ? 
  - russia invades and occupies territories of its neighbors - other russian neighbors , in fear of similar fate , ask allies to bolster military presence to dissuade similar invasion - allies are `` provoking '' something here in this logic train is not right . 
  yeah , that guy is definitely the entirety of our country , your post is absolutely correct in attacking our image because of him . 
   this could have been avoided . 
  what is `` this '' ? 
  a trade deal being delayed ? 
  oh eu , how could you !, 
  `` the eu is passing too many laws , they 're overturning democracy ! '',

    agriculture , the biggest share of the eu budget , escaped largely unharmed . 
  it was reduced from $ 386bn in the commission proposal to just over $ 378bn . 
    its staunchest defender , france , has argued that the commission proposal already reflected a reduction , and so should not be adjusted further . 
    the eu 's administrative budget , which covers salaries , pensions and other perks for civil servants , `` will have to be revised downward '' , the cypriots said , but did not yet provide figures . 
    the long-term budget negotiation is traditionally one of the eu 's most contentious tasks . 
  the current exercise is proving to be even more difficult because of the sharp divisions between net-contributors and net-recipients opened by the economic crisis . 
    david cameron , the uk prime minister , has argued that it is unacceptable to expect national governments to increase eu spending while they are forcing austerity cuts on their own citizens . 
  he has won support -- to varying degrees -- from a group of wealthy northern and western european member states . 
    at the same time , poland and the new member states -- with support from the commission and the european parliament -- have defended eu spending as a way to stimulate much-needed growth . 
    the commission has tried to fashion its own proposal , emphasising its many growth-enhancing features -- often to critics ' dismay . 
  one of its prized initiatives was a `` connecting europe '' facility to fund cross-border infrastructure projects , such as roads and gas pipelines . 
  the cypriots cut it from $ 40bn to $ 36bn , with at least $ 7bn coming from cohesion funds . 
  portugal is also often said to be one of the most religious countries in europe , and while i wo n't say we 're less religious that most countries in europe , it 's also not an issue here . 
  [ certainly not something harmful to economic growth . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/f%c3%a1tima,_portugal#economy ) check the following pages to see what i mean when i say religion is n't an issue :  [ religion in portugal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_portugal )   [ abortion referendum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_abortion_referendum,_2007 ), 
  i 'd bet on both those countries to have good economic growth but if i had to choose , i 'd never favour one over the other simply because one is slightly more irreligious than the other . 
  and unless you think poland is in danger of being seized by zealots , i think you also should n't make such a big deal out of this as in both societies religion just is n't an issue . 
  their tax rates , their employment rates , their justice system , the efficiency of their bureaucracy , the education of their population , the stability of their government , the presence or not of internal conflicts , etc - these are all much more important factors in determining a country 's economic growth than if it 's was 5 % or 35 % of the population that answered they were n't religious when asked about it . 
  nah , i mean , everything matters , but unless you 're talking about a highly fundamentalist country , it 's mostly irrelevant . 
  i mean , tell me , how the productivity of a guy differs that much if one spends some of his free time in church rather than doing something else like watching tv ? 
   funny how you get downvoted for making a fair point i made my post after midnight , by that time europe is asleep and all the americans that wander here must have read my post and probably confused me with some texan religious fundamentalist or some other kind of religious nutjob , no wonder i got downvoted . 
  but that 's my own fault , by now i ought to know that posting on r/europe at night is like posting elsewhere on reddit at any given time , the place is filled with americans and they associate everything with just their reality - obviously if i do n't hate on religion or if i support a free market , their knowledge of their republican party and their lack of knowledge of how things work on the rest of the world gets me associated with those idiots they have there and i get some grief as consequence . 
  edit : at the time i made this post , my original post was at -5 . 
  what 's so funny about those retarded trollfaces ? 
  at least present a different image like [ this trollface ] ( http://i.imgur.com/okxue.jpg ) , because that one has been the same since 2007 or 2006 . 
   if spain would dissolve itself in its constituent nations it would be easier to have an iberic council and if we all worked together and loved one another , we 'd all be friends and live in peace . 
  and this is all never going to happen . 
  the most you could do in terms of promoting efficiency in these terms would be to allow for greater regionalism and direct democracy , and perhaps work more with [ nuts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nomenclature_of_territorial_units_for_statistics ) , but even so , i doubt this would be feasible . 
  regardless , breaking up and joining up states for the purpose of balancing the power of the member-states just is n't ever going to happen . 
  yugoslavia was a state formed like that , and we all know how that ended up . 
  you do n't need pretty borders and states which all have the same population and/or wealth to have a properly run union , you just need democracy and letting people decide what 's best for themselves . 
  and if malta disagrees with germany or germany disagrees with malta on some issue , let them go their separate ways , no need to force anything on anyone , everyone is responsible for the choices their do . 
  sure r/atheism is here . 
  yes , religion is stupid , but no , it 's not that related to economic growth . 
  sure , fundamentalists may be retarded and , among other things , destabilize society and drive away investment and , but it 's not even comparable to most other factors . 
  now everybody in the developed world is becoming less and less religious but if you look back some 30 years , you 'll see that the most non-religious ( aka the commies ) were the ones who were the most undeveloped while the mildly religious were the most successful ( usa , western europe and japan ) . 
  it 's not that related , because a guy goes to church on weekends and believes he 'll go to heaven if he plays nice , that does n't make him less productive than some other guy who does n't do any of that . 
   ( places that legalise abortion tend to see a sharp decline in youth crime exactly 17-18 years later ) . 
  i can find the sources if you want . 
  yeah , i also read [ freakonomics ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk6goeggviw ) . 
   no ` god ' in the way helps a lot , imho . 
  i do n't get this bit . 
  you 're saying they 'll develop faster economically because they 're societies who are for the most part non-religious ? 
   if your definition of e.europe is geographical , then the baltic 's are part of northern europe . 
  like i said , estonia being a northern country does n't exclude it from being an eastern country . 
   [ northeast or north east is the ordinal direction halfway between north and east . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northeast ), 
   when i was expressing them politely and trying to create discussion , i got simply mass-downvoted and banned . 
  i 've been an asshole myself quite a few times now , sometimes being outright impolite and just starting shit where there 's nothing to discuss , and was never mass-downvoted and banned like you say . 
  yeah , it 's normal for people to not like it when others sound hateful but , at least here , they do n't react like that . 
   what 's the use in embedding links & articles to posts , building arguments and using coherent grammar when you are as default treated like troll shit simply for having a stance that is impossible to argue against because it is the correct one ( but not politically correct one ) , measuring by personal-insults-to-counter-arguments ratio ? 
  again , i am also often part of the minority in terms of opinion ( and sometimes just argue controversial positions which i do not agree with for the hell of it , because i enjoy going against the wave , i dunno ) and never was i insulted and downvoted like that . 
  there are as always some random assholes who might do just that , but that 's perspective , from their point of view , we 're the ones who 're being assholes . 
   thus i really started acting like troll shit . 
  you get what you order . 
  after finding this subreddit and how it handles people who disagree with multiculturalism , i 've just gotten more extreme . 
  good job , everyone . 
  if you 're serious , then you 're acting like a spoiled baby who needs to make a big scene and start drama simply because most of the people disagree with him . 
  get over it and do n't blame others for your actions , that 's silly . 
  if you 're not serious , then i wasted a couple of minutes making this reply , so i guess you win . 
  though i do n't really put much value on my time , so it 's not like i care that much - if i really did value my time , i would n't be wasting it here in the first place . 
   agree to disagree . 
  this is going nowhere . 
  against facts there are no arguments . 
  nope , but [ eu3 can be even worse than that ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gquia.jpg ) . 
   at least in syria you can get your money 's worth . 
  if by getting your money 's worth you mean risking to have a leg blown off just to provide medical supplies , then syria is a safe place to invest . 
   in greece , they 'll steal your money & you 'll get nothing . 
  while i wo n't say it 's currently safe place to invest , no , they wo n't steal your money . 
  czech republic , slovakia and slovenia are almost there , these will be very soon comparable to western europe . 
  estonia , latvia and lithuania , these have a longer way to go but they 're doing great and are very fast catching up . 
  i still do n't know if you 're just trolling or you 're an actual guy who thinks we 're being invaded by muslims . 
  i think it 's the former because if you were serious about your immigration policy views , you 'd at least try to not sound like a douchebag when expressing them . 
  is this 9gag ? 
  saying that estonia , one of the easternmost countries of europe , is n't part of eastern europe is like saying portugal , the westernmost country of europe , is n't part of western europe . 
  on , and just so you know , there are more than just four cardinal points . 
  estonia being a northern country does n't exclude it from being an eastern country . 
  [ my map is the most colourful one . 
  i have always found the idea of capeverdean accesion interesting , and i 'm not sure i 'd be against it . 
  if it was n't for the soviets funding the militias and , after the revolution of 1974 , m\u00e1rio soares giving the territories away , cape verde would still be portuguese and , by consequence , now in the eu like the azores or madeira . 
  obviously that did n't happen like that and despite cape verde being uninhabited before the portuguese colonization , all [ the portuguese moved back to portugal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/retornados#the_retornados ) after its independence and the islands became abandoned to the militias . 
  and even so , iirc , more than 50 % of all cape verdeans live in portugal rather than in cape verde . 
  so while we now would n't deny their independence or anything like that and they technically should be able to join the eu , it goes to show how ridiculous the post-revolution process of giving away independence to any goon with ussr funding was . 
  cyprus is in asia and they 're in the eu . 
  the difference between canada and cyprus is that canada is an whole ocean away rather than a sea . 
   about the states it 's hard to change the borders in some places because of historic matters , while it would be `` easy '' to change countries like germany and austria , you ca n't expect a peaceful change between portugal and spain for example , nor can you expect malta to accept ceasing to exist . 
  yeah , that 's not going to happen ever . 
   greece considered more risky to invest than syria ahahahahahahahaha, 
   i 'm curious , what kind of eu does the uk want ? 
  [ this one . 
   ( apparently all those hours playing ck2 , eu3 and v2 were worth something ) http://i.imgur.com/yevxm.jpg, 
  unlike what the gif shows , portugal was never incorporated in castile/spain during the dynastic union . 
  it 's silly how these maps often mistakenly show otherwise . 
  really , would a country like portugal which at the time had an immense empire suddenly disappear and 60 years later reappear unscathed out of thin air ? 
  it 's still retarded . 
   and i doubt so deeply it 's worth it . 
  [ you 're right . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84awtseb2-4 ), 
  i have some friends from university on the opposite situation , they were born abroad ( mostly in france and switzerland ) and lived there till they were 5 or 6 years old and then moved back to portugal with their families . 
  and then you have people like me , whose parents were born in portuguese africa but after the colonial war and the fall of the regime , they returned to mainland portugal and have been here ever since .

    ** `` there may be delays on the jubilee line '' **   `` there may be delays on the jubilee line ; and let me tell you something , that 's why i never take public transport '' you forgot the others , these are hilarious !, 
   `` n\u00e3o \u00e9 a conquista que importa , \u00e9 a parte tomar '' tomar is a city in portugal but it 's clearly not what they meant , they meant `` tomar '' as in `` to take '' . 
  it still does n't make any sense though . 
  `` n\u00e3o \u00e9 a conquista que importa , \u00e9 a parte tomar '' means `` it 's not the conquest that matters , it 's the part take '' . 
  if they wanted to say `` it 's not the winning that matters , it 's the taking part '' they should have said `` o que importa n\u00e3o \u00e9 ganhar , mas sim participar '' ( `` what matters is n't to win , it 's to participate '' ) . 
  it 's the same thing with brazil , goes to show they just used google translate on the 6th most spoken language in the world , so i guess they really do n't care . 
  good humor but not politics . 
  and , honestly , both ajj and pnd are awful . 
  your far less is still a lot !, 
  not paying tuition fees and then having to pay so much for everything else kind of beats the purpose . 
  i with that yearly income , i 'd be able to afford all expenses regarding college for an year and would still be left with some ~ 19500 $ . 
  or , if you look at it from another way , $ 21k ( what he makes in a year after taxes ) is enough for me to go all the way through college 4 times ( considering i do it in the 3 years ) . 
  one does n't need to live here where the weather 's great to know what i 'm talking about . 
  everyday i seem to catch tourists in the subway , specially now that summer is right here . 
  they also get a taste of it . 
   they 're lovely , let me tell you that . 
  it 's not only the great weather , it 's the great people from all over europe who come here on holidays . 
  the antenna time ( tempo de antena ) , you know , whenever there 's election and all parties have loads of free time to broadcast their crazy ideas in prime time tv with taxpayer 's money . 
  it 's an essential part of the democracy but they often exaggerate and it leads to jokes like [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3h1tkud_yc ) being broadcast right before the evening news , and frankly , if they get all these benefits just for existing , they have it pretty good and should n't be demanding more !, 
  they clearly get their message across and people just are n't interested !, 
  oh , and regarding my example , it 's just the first example i could find , there are some even worse than that , if hitler montages and people playing with cardboard machine guns were n't enough being shown to everyone on rtp were n't bad enough . 
   page not found  we could n't find the page you were looking for . 
  either way , regarding the title , there 's no hardship on the periphery to preserve the center . 
  what there really is a general effort by all member-states to consolidate their accounts and not get runaway public debts , as that 's harmful to the union as a whole . 
  it so happens that , for several different reasons , the periphery countries are having an harder time in doing such , because the hardships and goals are the same for everyone . 
   maybe they do n't have more than 2 % of support because they do n't have more air time in the state media , the same media that 's supposed to exercise electoral law during election periods . 
  that 's just wishful thinking , they already have hours of free time where they spread their ideology . 
  people know about them , they just laugh at them . 
  and quite rightly so , it 's hard to take them seriously . 
   thanks for proving me right by not providing concrete examples supporting your claims . 
  me not giving concrete examples does n't prove you right . 
  not to mention you also are n't giving any concrete examples yourself . 
  it is n't . 
  change is in dire need but that does n't mean it will collapse . 
  [ there , i just drew him . 
  and even now they failed . 
  to all the swedish , you are like the worst terrorists ever !, 
   i hope you 're proud of how portugal 's rightwing politics of the last 35 years have worked so far !, 
  everything is socialized , astronomical public debt , the state pays for everything . 
  i wonder how this even resembles rightwing politics . 
  and no , i do n't consider neoliberal to be an insult nor do i consider myself a neoliberal , i 'm in fact very centrist , not enough left to be ps but not right enough to be psd . 
  take it as you want it . 
   pcp honored the north korean people . 
  they said they did n't agree with kim jong il 's take on left politics , but still mourned him out of respect for the nk people . 
  why am i not surprised you did n't read their message ? 
  i not only read it , i shared it with others . 
  it was purely in bad taste and they worded it in a way that the offenders looked like the usa or south korea , when in fact it was nk who invaded the south . 
  i 'm just not going to argue against such propaganda detached from reality . 
   i know , demanding equal and fair treatment ia a crazy idea , right ? 
  equal and fair ? 
  do n't they have tons of air time paid by the taxpayer already ? 
  i 'm not against that , what i 'm against is their attitude of entitlement , no , them ( or any other crazies , be them pnr , pnd , ppm or pous ) can even get 2 % of the votes , why should they have the same air time as those who represent the will of hundred thousand of millions of portuguese ? 
  that 's not equality , that 's clearly shoving your beliefs down everyone else 's throats !, 
   it looks like you 're blaming each party for all of their bullshit combined . 
  that 's quite petty . 
  that 's just two examples , though i 'm not going to bother to give more , i 'm do n't think i can change your opinion and i doubt you 'll change mine so i rather just focus on other things . 
  i already spend way too much of my evenings and nights on the internet !, 
  i 'd rather not have to tell others how great things are but rather just have a great time !, 
   and i do plan on spending more of my nights out , you know . . just going out with friends , drinking beer and some shots , listening to some blasting to house music , getting more than used to the smell of tobacco and weed and overall having the nicest time with the best looking babies not wearing much because the temperature is just great !, 
  i mean , the internet 's not bad , it 's certainly cheaper than going out , but the fun that one can have out there surely beats sitting in front of the monitor !, 
   i 'm a student , and i live very comfortably on my student loan + a part time job , totaling at about $ 21,000 a year after taxes . 
  21.000 $ / year ?? 
  damn !!, 
  i 'm also a student and i only pay 1000 $ / year in college tuition fees , and this is my biggest expense !!, 
  other than that , i pay 27 $ / month on transportation fees ( i live only 45min away by bus and subway ) and eating there costs only 2.30 $ , though i always lunch at home because i eat better and it 's cheaper . 
  regarding school material , it 's also negligible , i can handle myself with two notebooks , the calculator i have since my 5th grade and some photocopies . 
  i mean , i 'm not the best example , i 'm in a [ public college ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/university_of_porto ) , i still live with my parents and even get them to cook for me , i never had to work nor did my parents had to take a loan to get me in college ( though they 're not exactly rich , they just saved when i was younger ) . 
  but still , even with all this , the highest i know someone pays in tuition fees is 5000 $ / year , and that is in the best [ private college ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/universidade_cat%c3%b3lica_portuguesa ) , no wonder that 's expensive , and even though , compared to 21k $ / year , that 's a small amount . 
  1750 $ / month , that 's more than twice higher than the average full time wage here , and i 'm talking without taxes !, 
  i think the worst thing might just be the cold dark weather . 
  it 's these warm sunny days where all the girls are pretty and everybody seems to be enjoying themselves that make me happy of my country , i just ca n't see myself ever moving away from this wonderful weather . 
  i do n't really want to start another portuguese politics discussion and going again over how ridiculous the far left is , we already have enough of that in / r/portugal and besides i have my finals to study for . 
  i was n't alive when the revolution happened and therefore i can only judge them from what they say and do now , and yes , honoring the death of kim jong il or disrupting tv broadcasts to complain about the lack of democracy when all the small parties have loads of free time on tv to spread their crazy ideas , yes , both parties seem like an utter joke to me . 
  not really unelected , just like one votes for a party or a politician and then does n't have any say in their decisions , we voted for the members of the ep and it was them who got barroso where he is now . 
  sure , it could be a more direct process , but it 's not like he could all vote for or against everything coming out of the eu , just like what already happens with most of the national-level legislation , it 's the political parties chosen in elections that have a say in this . 
  do n't worry though , barroso has little power and anything the eu can come up with , the member-states can reject/veto . 
  i do agree with you , however , the eu needs to be more efficient and its politicians more accountable . 
  to be fair , in the aftermath of a left wing military coup that overthrew the fascist estado novo that ruled for over half a century , nobody who wanted to be taken seriously would not be supportive of left wing policies . 
  and barroso at the time was only 18 years old . 
   they 're so to the left that they thought the communist party ( pcp ) was n't left enough and more like to the right . 
  mrpp members even used to crash on pcp 's reunions and give a beating to everone present . 
  and the pcp said the mrpp was funded by the cia . 
  and cdu ( pcp+g reens ) and mrpp together accounted only 9 % in the last legislative elections . 
  they 're a joke now . 
   commie barroso lol !!!!!!!!, 
  i 've heard that cold weather was the reason why we discovered the world , because here it 's cold in the winter and so we went to africa and south america , where the natives are topless all year . 
   77f sorry , we do n't speak uncivilized . 
  it 's hard to deal with international issues when the british say one thing , the french other and the germans yet another . 
  that 's just more arguments for a real representative of the eu . 
  and regarding the balkans and greater europe , a unified europe should n't be about who 's or not european but rather who wants to be part of this european project . 
  the balkans seem to have enough on their plate to be worrying about the eu and it 's certainly their decision and not ours if they want in or not . 
   i 'd be more up for something like that than the current massive cultural ` melting pot ' . 
  i 'm still fully for the open borders and the possibility to live and work wherever within the union but trying to bundle all these different cultures together would be just insanely impossible . 
  besides , what 's important is the cooperation between us europeans and a single voice to the outside world . 
  not someone from wherever telling iberians , italians and irish that they should all do the same , as that clearly would not work , these countries have different problems and different ways to tackle them . 
   basically , though further integration is n't a bad thing , centralized government is n't required outside of areas such as foreign relations or security . 
  there needs to be a balance , greece and portugal should have the same public debt standards as germany and denmark but nobody is willing to give up their full sovereignty ( for example , portuguese drug laws or maximum sentences are fine the way they are , we do n't want them changed by anyone , specially if they come from the outside ! ) . 
   look at greece and germany . 
  so much friction . 
  not just the politics , but people 's attitudes and opinions .

gender identifying region what is that ? 
  gender theory is usually used to describe gender as relating to social relations , stereotypes and social roles , and not to describe biological differences between men , women , and intersex . 
  that 's absolutely true , muslims in the western world are more moderate , but that happened over the years , and it happened because they were a minority who had to adapt , without the power of significant numbers to affect policy . 
  the same might not be true when millions of refugees are trying to enter europe . 
  they wo n't be living in neighbors of moderate westerners to adapt with but instead be staying in settlements of refugees , with the culture of refugees . 
  they wo n't grow progressive at the same rate as individual immigrants did , and the fact that they 're seen more suspiciously and that they 'll be under more police scrutiny , and the difficulty in acquiring stable productive employment might work instead to radicalize them . 
  regarding your edit : it ' easy to turn enemies into cartoon villains , but the terrorists who die for their cause every day are n't doing `` anything for power '' . 
  they are fighting for a cause they believe in , and while their leaders might be the power-hungry bastards you imagine , those types of people have always existed in every culture . 
  so it would be more productive to think about what makes their ideas stick in the minds of so many martyrs around the world , many of whom were second-generation muslims , when the same thing does n't happen with religious youngsters of any other creed in the western world . 
  the answer is n't solely religion , but it 's insane to pretend it does n't play a part . 
  just as it did play a part in christian violence in the past , which does n't happen as often today only because christian people are today more secular = less religious . 
  on the other hand , hating muslims is playing a part in moderating conservatives . 
  i 've never seen so much empathy for gay people from the conservative side than when they realized they could synergize their hate by directing it against gay-killing muslims . 
  ask any christian if they believe the ten commandments are to be followed . 
  christianity is n't a monolith of belief , and neither is islam . 
  different groups follow different interpretations of their holy book . 
   if you are to be believed you mean , if the strawman you put up is to be believed . 
  that the method and place is unusual does n't change the fact that murder happens everywhere , that this crime is not anywhere near the same camp as mass shootings or terror attacks , and to really figure out how much of a problem this level of crime is you 'd have to look at long-term statistics rather than point at a few anecdotal events . 
  but sure , no , portugal has a machete murder on every street . 
  that 's totally what i was saying . 
  same as always happens . 
  murder is nothing new , and there 's always someone trying to fear-monger off of them . 
  correction : there 's someone trying to fear-monger only if there 's an ethnic minority or those blasted teenagers involved . 
  approving is n't the same as thinking it should replace secular law . 
  if you ask christians whether biblical law is more important to them personally than secular law , a majority will say yes , but that does n't mean they want biblical law made law of the land . 
  [ only 23 % of uk muslims support introduction of sharia law ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law ) and i ca n't find any of the `` multiple polls '' suggesting otherwise , so i 'm going to assume you were equally wrong about french muslims , or that you do n't know what a majority is . 
  while it 's likely not what happened , you ca n't say it does n't make sense that it would happen , because sumka existed . 
  the left does n't embrace islamic fascism . 
  the left embraces muslim people and rejects criticism of islam for fear it will lead to violence and rejection of innocent muslims . 
  that 's not the same . 
  people were n't just making guesses . 
  they were n't saying `` i think this is likely islamic terrorism '' . 
  they were using the tragedy to push their agenda on a guess . 
  `` merkel needs to go '' and `` send the muslims home '' are n't decisions we can make based on guesses . 
  guessing is fine . 
  but people who do it need to acknowledge the subsequent low level of certainty that comes with a guess on very little information . 
  i meant in europe , but yeah . 
  and islamic terrorists sometimes kill muslims during attacks . 
  terror attacks are rarely as clean as breivik . 
  they 'll still say it 's her fault because letting in the refugees stoked the flames of far right nationalism . 
  there is no reasoning with hate . 
  i do n't see how it 's any better here . 
  it 's `` merkel got blood on their hands '' , it 's `` let 's mass deport muslims '' , you name it . 
  without any indication that this was islamic terrorist , without any caution to wait for confirmation . 
  hate and prejudice is fast and sticky . 
  is it that hard ? 
  because right now we do n't even know who was behind the shooting , what their religion or affiliation are , or what they look like ( apart from `` blurry '' ) . 
  violent crimes happen from time to time and they wo n't stop happening just because there are more terrorist attacks in between . 
  so please , people control your bias for a little while until we get actual information . 
  it 's a video of a shooting , and it 's right outside the oez . 
  so unless they coincidentally staged a fake shooting there a few months ago or there was another shooting , i think we can confirm this one . 
  it is munich . 
  mcdonald 's just across the oez mall . 
  you can see the building in the background is the same , even though the mcdonald 's was n't finished : https://www.google.pt/maps/@48.1841687,11.53162,3a,75y,327.05h,79.58t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1scz1cbzqfzysbqoovtqquzg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 this was the footage : https://twitter.com/onlinemagazin/status/756540786305531904,

   turkey has allways had , like russia and others , had a romantic nationalist movement of restoring empire . 
   just like ionia , cappadoccia , pontus , parthia and constantinople have and will allways be greece . 
  whereas you just seem to hold a romantic nationalist ideal of restoring some other nation 's empire . 
  no , i saw you were from romania . 
  but historical literacy is usually rare even when it 's about one 's country , so i did n't assume you were baiting trolls . 
  neither the roman empire or rome were named after the romani people , though . 
  it 's just convergente evolution of the words . 
  yah , but it 's also not as bad as it would be if we were in bahgdahd , where terror attacks happen almost every day . 
  ok , let 's do this :  the study on uti 's and their link to circumcision has been outright disproved ( far more thorough studies have time and time again failed to connect the two and the original study has been criticized over its methods ) by far more thorough studies , do you mean [ this meta-analysis of 18 studies ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18316994 ) that shows an almost 10 times higher risk of uti in uncircumcized individuals ? 
  or do you mean [ this systematic review of 12 studies ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15890696 ) that shows as well a significantly reduced incidence of uti with circumcision ? 
   the std study was riddled with flaws starting with different treatment what std study are you criticizing exactly ? 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17321311 ) , or [ this one ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19616720 ) , or [ this one ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19198042 ) , or is it [ this one ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19321868 ) ? 
  they all show a decrease in hiv/herpesvirus transmission . 
  worst of all , why did you become convinced there was only one study supporting a widely practiced medical therapy ? 
   the subjects were also the ones who were interested in the study in the first place that 's only a flaw if this only happened in the treatment arm of the trial . 
  if only we knew what uncited study you decided to attack with your comment , we might be able to see if that actually happened . 
   the recovery period was included in the time they monitored the applicants what was the time of monitoring in this supposedly awful study ? 
  the ones i cited follow the patients for two years , and it 's a bit hard to believe a 7 day recovery period would have a big difference there . 
   furthermore the u.s.a. where circumcision is the most prevalent in the developed world also has the highest std rates in the developed world this is what 's called the [ ecological fallacy ] ( http://web.stanford.edu/class/ed260/freedman549.pdf ) . 
  you ca n't reach conclusions on the behaviour of diseases on individuals based on the behaviour of the disease in a large population . 
  this little factoid does n't tell me if the people in the us with higher rates of hiv are also the ones who had circumcision . 
  as far as we can scientifically infer , there could be no connection . 
  the ecological fallacy gives credence to zero arguments , ever . 
  furthermore , the existence of other risk factors for std transmission does n't invalidate the potential benefits of circumcision . 
   keep in mind that these studies were performed in regions of africa where hiv and aids are prevalent yeah ? 
  is n't that what i said ? 
  oh , wait it is :  in certain parts of africa where stds are epidemic or antibiotics and antiretrovirals are n't readily available , it 's a useful preventive procedure even in babies . 
  well , if someone on the internet tells me studies were disproved , i guess that 's the end of that . 
  well , it 's a good thing i did n't say there was . 
  not so good for your reading comprehension , though . 
  how common something is is n't the only variable used to define whether or not it 's a medical condition . 
  and if it 's causing suffering , if it 's painful , if it makes urination harder or if it 's causing multiple repetitive urinary infections , then treating it is reasonable whether or not you want to keep arguing the semantics of what to call it . 
  the obsession with not catching an infection ( which is a medical condition whichever way you put it ) is more of a reasonable concern . 
  medical circumcision is still a valid treatment for tight foreskin ( which is almost universal in babies ) . 
  but because it is an irreversible body modification , it should ideally be the last line of treatment after manual gentle stretching of the foreskin or after glucocorticoid cream . 
  on the other hand , circumcision in children is associated with lower rates of urinary infection and lower rates of std transmission ( including aids ) , so outside of europe , in certain parts of africa where stds are epidemic or antibiotics and antiretrovirals are n't readily available , it 's a useful preventive procedure even in babies . 
  ritual circumcision is however , not justified . 
  and if we can judge the parents who choose not to give their kids life-saving antibiotics for their meningitis because of religious reasons , then we have to apply the same standard to those who perform non-licensed non-regulated permanent surgery on people who can not give consent . 
  some ** adults ** do it for esthetic reasons and they report satisfactory results ( statistically significant improvement in sexual relationships , likely because decreased sensitivity allows them to last longer ) . 
  beats me . 
  but abortion before the 10th week of gestation was legalized in 2007 . 
  maybe rates just increased with time normally as people became aware of how available it was and/or society acceptance grew ? 
  before we all jump on the bandwagon of portuguese low abortions being due to some great cultural traits or the availability of free contraception , remember that this is a 2010 chart , and that [ 2012 values were already equal to spain 's ] ( http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/mapeuropeabrate.html ) . 
  they 're both adaptations from mandarin . 
  portugal got their word directly from the mandarin ( through macau ) , and the uk and affiliates got theirs through dutch from malay from mandarin .

  i wanted to try the really different things . 
  i 've seen an angolan one . 
  it was bad but not as bad as venezuelan ones . 
  where ? 
  `` copo '' is exactly the same . 
  i personally prefer english versions of everything to brazilian portuguese ones , specially when it comes to written content . 
  brazilian translations have a deserved reputation of being awful . 
  part of the reason is subtitles and part is that portuguese is phonetically richer than both spanish and italian . 
  in spain they dub even the moans . 
  i always wondered what the people doing that work think . 
   17,98 euro per month at least here it 4 or 5 euro . 
  still , it 's a robbery . 
   fyi , one of her biggest ` proofs ' that they are such good quality , is that they are exported all over the world . 
  that 's an argument ?!, 
  ps : brazilian soap operas are cancer . 
  mexican and venezuelan soap operas are even worse . 
   there was this soap opera that was dubbed by a single person with a manly voice . 
  the polish method . 
  i read `` a comment '' totally not insulting . 
  harsh and politically incorrect but no name calling , no threats , nothing .

  if that comment was the reason for the ban , this is an egregious abuse of power . 
  so he was banned for that ?!, 
  if so , totally unacceptable abuse of power . 
  if you are banned how come you can make these edits ? 
   keeping him in detention jail which is usually worse than regular prison really ?

  if you make it impossible to live in their part of the world , then do n't act surprised when they come over to yours . 
  this is why people end up calling other people childish , because they are trying to ignore the consequences of their actions . 
   before you start trying to say that they 'll assimilate , some will , but most will stay within thier homogeneous communities most will assimilate , this is a statistical fact . 
  as long you help them , they 'll assimilate .

  it 's past 20 already !, 
   it 's childish to see the violence perpetrated by these immigrants and thier disdain for the native culture it 's very childish to ignore why those things are happening in the first place , yes . 
  we tend to call people who are n't aware of the consequences of their actions irresponsible and childish . 
  you ca n't shit all over an entire world region and then act surprised when one or two guys from there are n't happy about it . 
  it 's also childish to punish a huge amount of people for the actions of a tiny few .

  that 's what i thought at first , but i keep looking for that info and ca n't find it anywhere so i was presuming it was n't true . 
  i have that one too , $ 9 not $ 7,5 . 
  that was my old one , i got confused . 
  anyway , $ 9 for 500mb is still very far from '' $ 30 ` ish for 500mb '' , so i 'm confused on why you said otherwise . 
  the yornx we both use is for all ages, 
  the 500mb are crossed over , though . 
  it says 2gb under it . 
  you get 2gb for $ 28 . 
  and that 's the red option , which is supposed to be used with tv and the home deal , really . 
  if you go for yorn , you can get 500mb for 7,5 $ and other better deals . 
  i 'm currently paying 7,5 $ for 500mb . 
   but otherwise , yes . 
  500mb for 30 ` ish $ . 
  what are you on about ? 
  this is not true . 
  you can get 500mb at vodafone for 7,5 $ and i 'm pretty sure nos and meo are close to that too . 
  no , i pay 7,5 $ for that and college kids get a better deal . 
  what a beautiful voice . 
  damn , he could have just edited out the parts he does n't agree with , like the rest of us . 
  like how bernie says he 's a `` socialist '' . 
  or how the american democrats say they are the `` left '' . 
  or how north korea say they are `` democratic '' . 
  just because they say it , it does n't mean they are . 
  until i see corbyn trying to seize something , i 'm going to remain skeptical . 
  i was neither agreeing or disagreeing with the sentiment , just explaining that you read it wrong . 
  that 's interesting , i believe you that it definitely affect them . 
  but there 's so many more studies pointing that the major link to school success is how much you invest in said school and the countries education system .

  triste , tavira !, 
   black kids in america are lower achievers in schools because they feel they are expected less as shown by statistics ... 
  it 's got very little to do with that . 
  it 's just that most of the black kids are in the shitty ghetto schools with up to 40 kids in the same classroom and teachers who are n't paid enough to deal with all of their problems . 
  that 's is n't the story , though . 
  re-read : '' ` they keep telling white people that they 're born into a society which advantages them over others '' . 
  clearly they are n't saying it 's the white people who have to take care of themselves . 
   people are saying white colored individuals were never held as slaves , were never treated as lesser than , therefor to categorize this as racism is an extremity . 
  well that 's a very ignorant view of history . 
  there were and still are today plenty of white slaves . 
  if the retaliation is racist , then it 's racist . 
  if they had chosen anything else to prohibit entry , then it would 've been a discrimination of whatever they had chosen . 
  since they chose a race , it is racist . 
  it 's the meaning of the word : discrimination towards someone based on their race . 
   i wrote an argumentative paper about this exact topic can you share that here ? 
   even when he walked in he looked like he did n't want to be there he pretty much did n't . 
   how is him winning eurovision a victory against that evil music industry ? 
  when you win it with a song like that it is . 
  you 'd be able to understand this if you were n't the densest motherfucker in the world . 
   it 's like when a team wins a championship or something , then says the smartest team won not really comparable because there 's no greater context around it . 
  he was * very obviously * talking about the music industry and not the other contestants , but you fuckers need your drama so enjoy . 
   he was talking about his competitors by saying that him winning was a victory for real music he was talking about the music industry , you dense motherfucker . 
   most european countries send artists who are pretty big nationally no they do n't . 
  everybody sends the trash or nobodies . 
   then why be there ? 
  he 's there to bring `` feeling '' back to music .

   sigh , you also do n't seem to understand that they ( unlike a lot of other sub saharan african countries ) do not have any civil wars no civil war is success ? 
  great standards you have . 
   they have been successfull in fighting the increase in the hiv epidemic so now that 1 in every 4 adults is infected they 're starting using condoms ? 
   they have improved their education level they should take some time and get some sex ed as well , i dunno  well known for being one of the least corrupt sub saharan countries by a perception index , basically by asking people if the country is corrupt or not , in short , science !, 
   yes , they , like all of sub saharan africa is battling hiv , but that in itself does n't make it a hell hole nor does it make them corrupt .

  botswana for example is one of the success stories of sub saharan africa , certainly not a hellhole and is probably less corrupt than greece . 
  great , you just managed to show everybody that you are ignorant . 
  yes , botswana is very successful certainly not an hellhole :  botswana is experiencing one of the most severe hiv/aids epidemics in the world . 
  the national hiv prevalence rate among adults ages 15 to 49 is 24.1 percent , which is among the highest in sub-saharan africa . 
  [ this is how i 'm browsing the web right now ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uzlkt.jpg ) .

  you are a true internet warrior , doing nothing and complaining the whole time . 
  at least i 'm not gullible enough to believe that eastern european countries are more corrupt than some hellhole in africa . 
  lol , you actually take a `` corruption perception index '' seriously xd, 
   so , what list do you use ? 
  provide another list then . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o52jol.jpg ) is the list i use . 
  it 's the only one i find accurate in comparing countries in terms of corruption . 
   silly op , we have to remove kebab from the eu , not flood us with it . 
    turkey will never join .

  piss off . 
   it is fascinating that they whith all the international involvement and all their promises to change things actually manages to fall on the list . 
  does n't exactly give you hope that things will improve . 
  bah , these corruption rankings are not accurate at all , `` corruption perception index '' , really ? 
  unless you think botswana is actually less corrupt than estonia , poland , czech republic or hungary . 
   i hope it proves to be a very expensive lesson to not only france , but europe as a whole , that populist socialism solves nothing . 
  ideologues are often immune to evidence and reason , history will repeat itself .

   `` inspired by similar websites in india and kenya , kristina set up edosafakelaki ( meaning `` i paid a bribe '' ) which allows people to report anonymously on cases of bribe-giving or taking , or indeed cases where bribes were refused . '',

   great initiative , but it 's ironic greece must learn from india and kenya how to fight corruption . 
  bitch please , you ca n't even get into india or kenya without having to bribe the border police . 
   greece maksa velat . 
   that is good , considering that greece has become more corrupt in the last year - they have fallen on transparency internationals list from number 80 to number 94 .

   to the honourable members so hotly contesting this pressure , stand back for a moment from the knee jerk reaction . 
  possessing a military is about far more than defense , it is about being able to protect the interests of your allies , contribute to multinational peace-keeping operations , supporting the overthrow of tyrannical regimes and ensuring that the interests of your nation are secured in the long term . 
  nice too see that you support american jingoism , considering that you have by far the largest military spending in the world . 
  but it 's for a good cause , right , it protects you by using drones against children , starting unwinnable wars in far away countries and staging coups in young democracies , how would you even survive without those ? 
   england could have no choice but to bomb scottish airports in order to defend itself from attack if scotland became independent , the former solicitor general for scotland has warned .

  holy shit !, 
  you guys need to nuke ireland and france asap or else you 're doomed !, 
   ffs . . uk and france ran out of bombs in libya . . and could barely resupply themselves . 
  more military spending on infrastructure . 
  supply units , etc is where all the damn money is needed so those shiny planes and ships can handle more than a few hours of fighting . 
  those bombs are expensive , you know ? 
  iirc the bombs the us dropped in libya in a single week were more than australia 's yearly gdp .

  while the portuguese population is n't fond of angola ( and vice-versa ) , i do n't think it 's a tense relationship , both governments make deals among each other ( unfortunately ) , we buy their crude oil and refine it to sell , and the angolan investment comes from a select elite ( which happens to be the family of the members of their ruling party namely isabel dos santos ) . 
  the angolan hatred of the portuguese comes from their party diverting the blame from them to us , similar to what happens in many former colonies . 
  what ? 
  why ? 
  yeah those guys are horrible , just look at how many families were destroyed by monopoly , they are the scrounge of the earth !, 
  nowadays i do n't think we have any . 
  historically we 've had periods of war with spain and france , but during other periods we were allies , there really is n't a sense of hostility towards the spanish , it 's more of a brotherly rivalry . 
  due to the extent the empire had there was periods of hostility with many countries and also periods of peace , the recurring rival/enemy was the ottomans but that no longer applies . 
  there is a bit of distrust towards the chinese because they have been purchasing many things in the country and people believe our government is selling the country to them , there is also a bit of hostility towards the eu and germany but that is to be expected , there is also distrust/hostility towards russia and middle eastern countries , but again , that is to be expected . 
  but greenland is denmark , and so are the faroe islands,

   nobody wants the apocalypse . 
  ultimately it all comes down to how crazy the governors of those countries are ( not just the presidents but also all the commanders of the armies and all the other people who rule over the country ) , but yes , if russia used nukes it would pretty much be mutually assured destruction , at least until someone finds a way to shoot down the missiles before it reaches the populated areas , similar to israel 's [ iron dome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_dome ) , in which case the borders would just become a no man 's land completely irradiated and destroyed , not to mention the impact on the enviroment . 
   proof number 99999 that portuguese are spaniards in denial of it . 
  :d nah , everybody knows spaniards are just portuguese with a lisp ;p, 
  why ? 
  what 's wrong with calling it that ? 
  they are a national army that is in charge of protecting civilians are they not ? 
  if anything i 'd say the spanish actually have the best name for it, 
   having a militarized police called guardia civil ( civil guard ) is a very spanish thing not really , they are comparable to our [ national republican guard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_republican_guard_\\ ( portugal \\ ) ) , the french [ national gendarmerie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_gendarmerie ) , the italian [ carabinieri ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carabinieri ) or the dutch [ royal marechaussee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_marechaussee ) and they are all joined by the [ european gendarmerie force ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_gendarmerie_force ), 
  norway has quite a bit of taxes , i 'd say switzerland , with their high salaries and low taxes , would be even higher, 
  yes , but floats are supposed to be satirical and make fun of certain situations and are almost never taken seriously . 
  whereas newspapers are a source of information ( although i ca n't talk specifically about that newspaper because i do n't know what they usually post ) so they 're usually taken more seriously , sure they have their satirical columns . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that , yes they are both a satirical exaggeration of events , but the medium in which they are convened are different , therefore making it a bit unbalanced , you expect these things from floats so it 's expected and people do n't make a big fuss about it , but in newspapers you might not get them so it makes it a bit unexpected and can end up surprising people, 
  is n't that just a higher minimum wage ? 
  would n't that cause a rise in prices ? 
  ( something that comes up every time some country wants to increase their minimum wage ), 
  really ? 
  for a float ? 
  they are supposed to be satirical , that one is n't even that bad [ this ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/polish-press-nazi-imagery-war-of-words-eu-angela-merkel ) is much worse because it 's an actual newspaper, 
   living wage what 's that , some sort of basic income ? 
  never heard of it before, 
  what i said was just my opinion , no way the government will do anything about the situation , they might comment it but that 's just it  why would portugal introduce such s policy oh my sweet summer child , you have no idea how this country works , if something benefits the ** politicians ** then they will pass it , if it benefits the people then they will `` consider '' it up until election year and then they rush it only to have it removed by the next government . 
  portugal has had a long history of crappy policy making and that is n't going to change anytime soon . 
   if portugal removes that they 'd very much be shooting themselves in the foot . 
  at the start , yes , but we also get lots of german and dutch tourists , in fact the past summer i saw more dutch and german people than british in my city , we could as easily make the same deal with them . 
   a tax cut for pensioners is nowhere near the same as in work benefits for eu migrants of course not , but that does n't mean the uk is in the right about removing benefits for people that actually work and pay taxes . 
  if they want to expel immigrants who do n't work and receive money from the government , then that 's something else which i agree with . 
  but removing benefits that should be available to all working members of the eu residing in the uk , borderlines slave labor and promotes discrimination . 
   what benefits to british retirees get from portugal ? 
  read the link on the comment , mostly tax cuts :  it is possible to move to portugal and pay absolutely no tax whatsoever on your pension , whether you decide to take it as one lump sum or as a regular income . 
   this is because the united kingdom has a double tax treaty with portugal and in 2009 , portugal introduced the nonhabitual residents regime . 
   this allows new arrivals who become tax resident to take all foreign sources of income such as pensions tax free for the first 10 years . 
   jason porter of blevins franks , a company that specialises in financial advice for british expats in europe , says this is available to anyone who has not been a resident for tax purposes for the previous five years . 
   to qualify , you need to register as a non-habitual resident with the portuguese tax authorities , and after 10 years you will be taxed at portugal 's marginal rates, 
  well it would only make sense that if the uk decides to cut benefits for working , taxpaying immigrants , then portugal should cut all benefits the british retirees get when moving here , [ which is quite a few ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/special-reports/11519095/the-ultimate-pension-freedom-retire-in-portugal-and-reduce-your-tax.html ), 
  although pretty much every city here has an ugly area which can make it hard to determine the ugliest one , [ here 's an article ] ( http://www.conexaolusofona.org/conhece-as-10-cidades-mais-bonitas-de-portugal-e-as-10-mais-feias-saiba-quais-sao/ ) with the 10 most ugly and most beautiful ( according to the author ), 
  it 's an [ old comedy sketch show ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/herman_enciclop%c3%a9dia ) from 1997 , created by one of the most famous ( here at least ) portuguese [ comedians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herman_jos%c3%a9 ) ( although he only has german nationality ), 
  mmmm , [ gouda ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ole9mttbjha ), 
  yep , it 's the most annoying accent we have , maybe tying with the accent spoken by the younger generations that envolves mixing portuguese and english words while speaking in order to sound `` hip '', 
  meanwhile , i wonder how many protests and strikes have happened in greece during the same time period, 
  one does n't invalidate the other , there 's also the accent that appears in [ revenge ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr55ie7le50 ) , which i think is the one trailbear was referring to, 
  i was basing it on [ this comic ] ( http://satwcomic.com/art/language-lesson.jpg ) as a joke, 
  or the [ valley girl accent ] ( https://youtu.be/mibg-w6tnle?t=2m29s ), 
  if you know the language well then you can notice ~ ~ slight ~ ~ [ diferences ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egrfsn2cu8e ) , if you place the parisian accent next to the marseille one you can notice a difference, 
   this guy has one of the strongest kakker accents i know that guy sounds more danish than dutch ^ ^ edit : ^ ^ in ^ ^ case ^ ^ someone ^ ^ did n't ^ ^ get ^ ^ it , [ ^ ^ i ^ ^ was ^ ^ making ^ ^ a ^ ^ joke ] ( http://satwcomic.com/art/language-lesson.jpg ), 
  i do n't think we have a posh accent , maybe the lisbon one , but i doubt it is . 
  but if you are talking about snobbish accents then i 'd say the '' [ tia de cascais ] ( https://youtu.be/a6a-xuukncs?t=6m16s ) '' accent which has that nasally pronunciation that also includes lots of hand movements, 
  fair point, 
  yeah , but that 's not exclusive to canada maybe that 's why no one mentions it , because their own country might be doing the same, 
   and putting seal clubbing and quebec in the same boat is n't very pleasant i was just stating the negative things that are usually associated with canada , your country has a good reputation so it 's a bit hard to get lots of negative things , and usually the most spoken bad things about canada are associated with the way they treated their natives , the seal clubbing and the crazy language laws from quebec , so even if they 're not on the same level they manage to get bunched together  you would n't be a fan of that either , i bet , if calling portugal shit was common enough that people believed it even we call our country shit so it 's not like it would be a very big insult or a lie for that matter :p, 
  you 'd think a canadian of all people would know why people joke about quebecois ( their stereotype is that they are rude , do n't like speaking english and want independence from canada ), 
  i 'm talking about words like electricity , for instance , in portuguese , we say eletricidade , yet before the orthographic agreement we wrote it as ele ** c ** tricidade , but virtually nobody in the country pronounces the c , same with arctic ( \u00e1r ** c ** tico before , and \u00e1rtico after ) , these changes make perfect sense , of course there are parts of the agreement that are silly . 
   dumbing down the language to make it easier to learn is n't why not ? 
  people are conveying the same message and it makes it easier for other people to learn , they probably did this because they want french to compete with english as a global language , the current generation might have a problem with the changes but if they start introducing them in schools then in about two or three generations it will be just as normal as the current form of communication . 
  then again i believe changes on this level should only be allowed through referendums , but i doubt it would pass , even for simple changes like replacing the * ph * 's with * f * 's, 
   this is not that , this is a regulatory body arbitrarily changing the spellings for the sake of making it `` easier , '' despite it not being spellings that anyone actually uses . 
  in that case , yes it 's a stupid change, 
  yep, 
  seal clubbing and the oil sands come to mind , oh and quebecois , apart from that yeah they 're pretty awesome, 
  love the country and the people ( if the stereotypes about your friendliness is true ) , the weather not as much although the vancouver area has a more mild weather ( i think ) . 
  ^ now ^ pls ^ send ^ maple ^ syrup, 
  there 's also the famous [ aluminium/aluminum ] ( http://grammarist.com/spelling/aluminium-aluminum/ ) ( even though it 's not exactly the same situation ) , and several others, 
  just people and their inability to change , happened here too . 
  it 's not like language changes over the years or anything / s if the population stops pronouncing letters in words and those letters are not important to the meaning of the word , then those letters are unnecessary . 
  just like it would make sense if an english speaking country decided to turn their * ph * into an * f * , and how the us decided to drop the * u * in colour, 
  you 're forgetting ireland, 
  but english is a global language , it 's the language you resort to when you visit a country whose language you do n't speak , and it 's more widespread than french or even german among the eu . 
  they should , but instead went for an over complicated system ( big surprise coming from the eu / s ) probably because the politicians from x and y countries were too lazy to learn english or outright refused to do so and they wanted a `` multicultural '' parliament , but at least they are employing the translators so there 's that . 
  [ even tusk had the decency to learn english when he was elected ] ( http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2014-10-06/local-news/european-council-president-designate-donald-tusk-learning-english-in-malta-to-take-office-on-1-dec-6736123196 ) . 
  welcome to the eu parliament , where the epp makes laws filled with loopholes and completely ignore the other parties that point out said loopholes in favor of their ~ ~ bribers ~ ~ lobbyists . 
  [ that 's what they want you to think ] ( https://i.imgflip.com/xeozd.jpg ), 
  [ japan has got you covered ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0ubesmr.jpg ), 
  and then you have [ this one ] ( http://www.convergencealimentaire.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/unilever.jpg ) , in the [ grand scheme of companies ] ( https://bloggingthechange.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/big-10.png ), 
   were there a lot of ( naval ) wars the wars usually had their naval parts , especially considering that england was also involved in some of them  i 've always been under the impression portugal and castille kind of left each other alone it seems like that because the borders changed very little but this is due to the conflicts ending in stalemates of the defending side winning because both sides were able to defend themselves , there were actually [ quite a few conflicts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_history_of_portugal#after_the_reconquista_.e2.80.93_conflicts_with_castile ) between the two countries and there 's even currently a '' [ disputed territory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olivenza ) '' ( not really , nobody cares about it we just bring it up as a joke ) so we have this kind or relationship of frenemies or sibling rivalry , we also like making fun of each other, 
  that 's easy , castile/spain, 
  [ it is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/england ) , teachers can be wrong , i 've seen a german teacher saying that zurich was switzerland 's capital even after we 'd told her that it was bern , and she would refuse to accept it . 
  needs more blue/purple hair, 
  [ fortunately not ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j1cfvc_qt0 ) , although it 's still quite homophobic . 
  damn y ^ o ^ u ^ u ^ u ^ u ^ u, 
   sorry , didnt mean to imply they dont have the azores anymore . 
  i was just kidding  in fact , of the two ( azores and madeira ) , the azores are the well behaved child that does n't cry independence every time the continent does n't give them what they want ( mainly money ) , so they are the ones with the least chances of getting independent . 
   portugal ** had ** all the cool places hold your horses , we still have the azores , although the [ us had a contingency plan for them ] ( http://www.rawstory.com/2010/11/us-plans-azores-1975/ ) during the 1975 revolution which could have lead to their `` independence '' . 
  they get lots of rain and even get the remnants of hurricanes sometimes , all that water + volcanic earth = very fertile land, 
  we finally managed to be in the top 10 of something that is actually good !,

  it \u00b4 s really interesting . 
  just wondering , how much does monthly maintenance of living in this type of places cost ? 
  because if you got gates , you need 24 hour a day , everyday of the year security , which even for just one person at the gates probably implies costs of dunno 15 times minimum wage , depending on local laws on night work and holiday and so on . 
  two people at the gate , 30 or more , plus of course lots more for administration and maintenance , nevermind the waste of space ( or if you make the space inside your new neighborhood private , the city is not going to clean it or maintain it right ? ) . 
  i was trying to figure out the equivalent of `` condominium fees '' for these sort of places . 
  in some places in south america , is incredible how the `` middle classes '' seem to have lots of people working in buildings , porters , full time cleaning ladies and gardeners and just stuff , but those are places where the `` middle classes '' earn 15 , 20 , more times than minimum wage , and i think that is probably not the case in poland . 
  how much of a burden finantially is to live in a place like this ? 
  i think there was a small trend here for gated communities maybe some 15 years ago . 
  some still exist , particularly in richer areas or holiday areas , but a few in more middle class communities , they just seem to be mostly open nowadays . 
  the ones that exist are expensive , places you associate withr football players and drug traffickers , the kind of places you need a car in and out . 
  most buildings have video cameras and so on , and maybe a security company providing alarms and emergency services and so on though . 
   you 're like 99 % portugese , no we are not . 
  first not sure i know what you mean by 99 % portuguese , if you mean nationality we got about 200-400 thousand ( numbers vary ) foreign residents in a 10 million population so that is at least 2-4 % of card carrying officially foreign people . 
  if you mean ethnicity , that does not count people who are portuguese but are from other backgrounds either partially or totally - if all your grandparents were chinese or from guinea or maybe german . 
  we don \u00b4 t make stats , we don \u00b4 t record race and ethnicity and stuff and not sure we even know how to define it ( there are a lot of people in between who are free to define or not define anything as they wish ) . 
  and we are giving nationality a lot now by people with one portuguese ancestor which maybe is far more culturally clashing than you can imagine - somebody who grew up in a foreign country is not more portuguese just because their 1/2/3 / 4 grandparents were portuguese than the kid whose parents came from brazil/ukraine/china and was born and grew in portugal . 
  not really mass market but a former portuguese colony is the african island nation of s\u00e3o tom\u00e9 e pr\u00edncipe , which was an important chocolate producer way back in the 19th century . 
  they still mostly produce chocolate and coffee , with tremendous production problems and almost no distribution circuits , and their chocolate and coffee is pretty expensive compared to others . 
  both the chocolate and coffee are sublime , in different ways , the chocolate very strong , the coffee so smooth , and they are both really worth trying to explore . 
  probably , outside s\u00e3o tom\u00e9 itself , the best place to find them is portugal , particularly lisbon , so if you are in portugal worth checking that out . 
  annoying and insulting ? 
  try getting some visas for some countries !, 
  you don \u00b4 t have a right to visit the usa . 
  you don \u00b4 t have a right to visit any foreign country apart from countries your country has treaties with regarding such things . 
  asking for some information on your trip is reasonable and i do not find it insulting as well . 
  and if it \u00b4 s annoying and insulting to you to fill online a form and spend $ 14 dollars to go to the usa just imagine what it is for lots of people in africa , south and central america , asia which need far more effort and money to have the right to visit europe . 
  do you think we should waive totally the need for visas , for entrance requirements , for the whole world ? 
   of course it does , it requires you to be esta approved . 
  which i can do online and pay through credit card 14 dollars . 
  as a travel visa requirements , it \u00b4 s really really as simple , and very cheap , as it gets - if i wanted for example to go to russia or angola it would be a real mess . 
  and from the other point of view , it \u00b4 s so much simpler than it seems to be from people from other parts of the world to get a schengen visa . 
  and since i think it is right for a nationl to have some control over the entrance of foreign nationals ( and ilegal immigration is a danger particularly to those willing ilegal immigrants ) i think the usa has the same right . 
  if the usa wants to treat european countries as individual , it also seems fair enough - and to all countries to decide if they really do want to be treated in bloc ( in which case the usa can decide to do just that and up the visa requirements for all ), 
  have you read the last of the post ? 
  the usa is actually not making it particularly difficult for me , so i don \u00b4 t see why we should make it a lot harder for them ( or spend a lot of money creating some kind of platform to make it equally easily for them ) . 
  and american tourists bring money , they probably spend more than many other nationalities , why harm our economy that way ? 
  if the argument is about about all the eu nations standing together , same rights to all eu citizens given by a foreign power , nah , not interested . 
  eu citizens should have the same rights when it cames to eu governments , but foreign nations have a right to treat them separately because after all we are not one state , one nation . 
  their country , their right to decide who enters and on what conditions . 
  it \u00b4 s 14 dollars last i saw . 
  https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/ not the same as 100 , and you can do it online in what 2 minutes ? 
  no going to embassies , leaving passports and so on ... maybe it is not fair exactly , but imo not worth making things difficult for american tourists , nevermind having to make some kind of platform , a way to handle efficiently visa requests . 
  and also if the eu decides to treat itself as a bloc regarding these visas , is it worth risking the usa/canada start demanding visas from the eu as a bloc ? 
  if they think some nationalities have a higher risk of ilegal immigration , it \u00b4 s their right to treat each nationality differently . 
  and the european countries a right to decide if that is ok with them or not ( and i think it is , not just because of economical interests but because fuck , it \u00b4 s their country , they got a right to notice stats and want to do something about that ) . 
  i don \u00b4 t think it will happen anyway , because quite seriously a lot of countries are not going to want to make things more difficult for low risk tourist visas from popular origins just because polish ( or other nations ) people abused their usa tourist visas too much . 
  i really doubt the eu is going to stand united on this . 
   fill an application , pay $ 100 $ 100 is a lot of money , particularly for something not actually necessary , for a stupid formality . 
  maybe you are planning to spend thousands already and won \u00b4 t notice it but $ 100 would surely be better spent on the country you are going to in something which you want , picked for , and that people providing a service are competing against each other for your 100 dollars . 
  or if it \u00b4 s all indifferent , there are tons of charities which would make much better use , globally , of your $ 100 than paying for a visa . 
  expensive visas make me feel ripped off , make a destination seem less attractive , more of a rip off . 
   however 98 % of families should n't be made to pay for a mandatory paternity test just because 2 % are stupid . 
  arguably if 100 % of babies were tested at birth , the price of the test could be legitimately supported by the local national health system and be much lower . 
  but not just paternity or at least paternity as a sort of health information right of the child - knowing something about half your genetic background is important . 
  and add some screening maybe , if at all reasonably cost efficient of any sorts of genetic issues of high prevalence/low cost ? 
  not a genetic test but for example all portuguese born babies are screened at birth for a particular ( genetic related , but the test is a blood test ) progressive disease . 
  that is not good for tourism . 
   washington and ottawa both demand visas before traveling for romanians and bulgarians , whose states joined the eu in 2007 . 
  the united states also excludes croatians , cypriots and poles from a visa waiver scheme offered to other eu citizens . 
  apart from poland which is schengen , the other countries are free to apply separate requirements . 
  if you are a young galician person , chances are your galician sounds a lot more castilian to us than of older rural galician people ( which in south galicia , to my ears is pretty much indistinguishable from portuguese ) . 
  so if it sounds like a spanish cadence or vowels , we may not pay so much attention , hey this vocabulary is pretty close to portuguese , it s portuguese ( and also we do not expect spanish to even try ) and might assign it mentally that speaker will not understand spoken portuguese back . 
  just say `` compreendo portugu\u00eas '' or `` percebo portugu\u00eas '' or `` sou galego '' when speaking . 
  i don \u00b4 t think it is a matter of dislike , on the contrary , i think it \u00b4 s trying to make it easier for you . 
  this reminds me of porto \u00b4 s former manager , lopetegui , who of course always got subtitles on tv . 
  but hearing the guy i actually think he was making an effort to learn portuguese ( spanish speaking players and managers never do ) and towards the end he was trying to speak portuguese , portuguese terms , but he got subtitled just the same . 
  the vocabulary is close enough , that for a random person who has not studied spanish we don \u00b4 t know if this word is different in spanish or not , or if the person is actually trying to speak portuguese , we just go by the cadence , accent to id the language spoken , more than words or grammar . 
   . could this be a result of portugal and spain having different timezones . 
  there is a a weird thing , that despite portugal and spain being on different timezones the spanish tend to do things later so it ends up being done at the same time . 
  say lunch in portugal around 1-2 pm , lunch in spain being between 2 and 3 pm . 
  the main tv news in portugal being at 8 pm , in spain being at 9 pm . 
  there is a theory about the weird spanish meal times that it is caused by their time zone being so `` off '' the natural solar hour and they compensating with it . 
  there is a big difference in intonation , expressiveness between european and american styles - and not just north america , i find brazillian news casts and tv anchors really surprising . 
  i made precisely the same comment , about the cheesy melodramatic presentation when this video was posted in r/portugal some months ago . 
  it just grates . 
  is there anything about the questions actually being asked ? 
  it only mentions questions being asked in phone interviews in english in some gulf countries . 
  because i frankly suspect language and cultural issues . 
  you people stop !, 
  you are noticeably happy it depresses everybody else , 
  sure dogshit is bad , but the amount of trash in nightlife places can be even more disgusting . 
  not just trash but human fluids - vomit , urine , and whatever , plus broken glass . 
  dog shit is almost harmless compared to that . 
  some photos http://bairroalto-comerciantes.blogspot.pt/2013_08_01_archive.html drunk people are messy . 
  this is one of the big clashes between inhabitants and tourism/night life , the garbage . 
  the other one is the noise of course . 
  but if you increase the number of tourists and night-life in a place the dirty it gets . 
  tourists got less inhibitions , don \u00b4 t understand customs , feel less fear or social censure , so it also gets worse . 
  ah , for bows ? 
  did not know that . 
  phd students ? 
  pfh . 
  can we please have our nurses back ? 
  it does not really make sense to compare . 
  the more nightlife , the more tourists an area has the more complicated it is to clean it up effectively - you can almost quit on nightlife areas . 
  then define cleaningness , are tags `` unclean '' ? 
  i don \u00b4 t like it but they are not unhygienic . 
  street art , real art , is not but for some people might look unclean . 
  we do . 
  mostly because portugal could not provide much help militarily that would be useful , would get overrun militarily by germany ( spain and germany had a secret deal https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_felix https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_isabella which is oddly reminiscent of spain allowing napoleon to invade portugal ) but britain would for form \u00b4 s sake be forced to divert resources to defend portugal militarily if portugal got invaded .

  the eez for the selvagens is fixed and defined and portugal is not looking to change anything of it . 
  eez of 370 miles in the selvagens is impossible , it would include all of the canaries . 
  what has been done there is the obvious , which is divide the eez into half between the canaries and selvagens . 
  light blue area on that link , currently un recognized eez for portugal http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exclusive_economic_zone_of_portugal this is about portugal \u00b4 s new proposal to augment its eez in other areas due to continental shelf laws , in central north atlantic areas - the dark blue area on the link . 
  which spain is objecting to because they are trying to revert decisions which have already been made way back in the past and contest an area which is not being increased or changed in anyway . 
  portugal has an eez in that zone of course . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exclusive_economic_zone_of_portugal it goes halfway between selvagens and the canaries . 
  the thing is portugal is requesting an extension of its eez , rounding it up so to speak ( the dark blue zone on that wikipedia link ) which would not change a thing near the canaries or selvagens or any place near spain but spain is objecting to that just to be contrary regarding the selvagens . 
  you can figure how well that was received . 
   the dogs rarely kill people , last incident was in '11 that does not seem at all rare to me !, 
  2 people in 2 years ? 
  did not work so well in china . 
  in fact a lot if abuses in the name of presenting a good face to foreigners . 
  try diario de noticias in portuguese . 
  we know . 
  nothing seems to bring portuguese and british together as fighting the spanish ( or their french overlords ) but look how funny this is , what spain decided to do at the same time - pissing off the british about gibraltar . 
  accepting mediation of the european commission currently headed by a former minister for foreign affairs of portugal ( also a former prime minister but the foreign affairs thing is more relevant for this . 
  the dirty fantasy of all portuguese diplomats has got to be to tell spain what they think of spanish territorial ambitions ) . 
  - pissing off portugal over a stupid issue and land which was never theirs ( and making people go all perejil lol ) by taking issue to the un where britain got a permanent seat . 
  not that this will be a security council issue , unless some guard kills an illegal fisherman but still not awesome strategic thinking is it ? 
  go home spain you 're drunk . 
  it is the text more or lesa reported in portuguese media as well - the only version in english so far . 
  this made a couple paper front pages in portugal . 
  president of portugal overnighted there just recently , and he was not camping , so pretty impressive for `` rocks '' . 
  these islands http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salvage_islands spain really is trying to piss off every country nearby : morocco , portugal , france over fishing rights on the bay of biscay , gibraltarians and the british . 
  ireland and italy should watch out . 
  if you mean fastest possible , of all possible packages , i found these for portugal meo http://meo.pt/aderir/outros-pacotes/pacotes/fibra?tipo=6#pacotes 200/20 92 $ not sure how many people use this extra fast package , it \u00b4 s much more expensive than normallish 100 mega packages . 
  and their advertised speeds are always pretty conservative estimates , not sure if there are any fines they are afraid of . 
  for comparison i use that company \u00b4 s 30/3 package and frequently measure my internet speed 40-50/10 -15, 
  the article , including the main one is interesting , but damn they could have asked somebody from the south their opinion  for people my parents age , their opinion of why children are getting so much taller has to do with refrigeration and uht packs as well - dairy is now safe !, 
  it \u00b4 s too hot in the south of europe for milk to keep , and milk is/was dangerous , brucellosis . 
  they had to boil milk and let it cool and boiled milk is disgusting . 
  yogurts , refrigerated milk , easy no-fridge needed uht all that only started to became common here in the 1970s . 
  ok , did not know , only know we invoked emergency and had only heard about the 2 croatian planes . 
  it \u00b4 s appreciated and i am sure they will help . 
  you were the only country which did btw . 
  last i heard 5 planes were fighting a particularly threatening fire near porto , might be some of those . 
  if the fire gets to a place with gas cannisters , it will not be good . 
  read it again then , and think some more . 
  spain is not australia and does not have australia \u00b4 s natural resources nor is australia ( of the many atrocious mining billionaires ) quite utopia . 
   and now we have again a left wing movement with an union promising to fight the poverty , distribute the farm land between the day laborers and universal education and health care . 
  and of course what they promise is what they will ( or even are able to ) achieve , if only somebody will put then in power . 
  righhhhtttt . 
  oh heck , i feel like i should give out copies of animal farm to everybody on this thread , just in case ( hey , it \u00b4 s on public domain on australia , just saying ), 
   who ? 
  it has been organized by an union . 
  all the material was stored in the vehicle of an union member . 
  who is going to have first pick of that stuff ? 
  who is going to hear first to be on this place at this hour when they redistribute the loot ? 
  friends and neighbours ? 
  who decides who gets what ? 
  that is my point . 
  hmm . 
  edit - and wtf occupying farm land has to do with government not providing school materials to children in need , i have no idea . 
   i want to remember everybody that the education is a public service and the government has the responsability of ensuring that everybody as access to it . 
  what has got to do with the supermarkets ? 
  if the government is not supplying education for free , why should people be able to help themselves to free merchandise from the supermarkets ? 
   your proposal is giving up that and asking for charity . 
  that 's not a solution . 
  asking for charity is much better than stealing !, 
  people who can help might * want * to help if given a chance to do it . 
  but nobody likes things just being taken `` for redistribution '' ( oh yeah , i bet i can guess who helped themselves first to the loot ) . 
  if charity is omg embarassing ( pride is a rich people \u00b4 s thing btw ) then why not set up a boycott , or a strike or something ? 
   anyways , such acts are rather publicity stunts to make people aware of the plight they are . 
  i do not think it works that way . 
  this type of tactics backfires . 
  people who otherwise would be very sympathetic condemn this . 
   edit : it 's not like there are other options . 
  do you have any sugestion ? 
  set up a bank/storage to collect all used text books - assuming you pay for textbooks , those are the real expense in my country . 
  for free , or set up some sort of scheme ( internet ? ), 
  where people can swap those . 
  collect used but usable school materials from people , or offices or companies . 
  talk with supermarkets and manufacturers if they have damaged material they can use . 
  discuss and pressure schools to reduce materials strictly necessary . 
  i would assume blackmail wanting to force airbus to move part of a350 production into hamburg . 
  want the money ? 
  we want somewhat different condtions than we agreed to . 
  particularly with elections coming up . 
  airbus makes an announcement regarding more a350 work in germany , lufthansa makes an airbus exclusive order and airbus gets their pre-agreed loan . 
  lufthansa order supposed to be large , 50-60 large wide body planes . 
  i sort of pity lufthansa though , they got some inevitable political pressure on what to order . 
  btw , i am cynic talking out of my ass so to speak . 
  but come on , this is pretty clearly what is going on . 
  this is interesting . 
  this is a lot of money and jobs . 
  lufthansa supposed to do a big plane order within a couple weeks , just before the elections . 
  posturing regarding that order ? 
  countries with population above 5 million only and i guess that is why norway was not included . 
  i guess it is about that no ? 
  the other two preconditions were life expectancy over 70 ( kinda of cheating imo ) and per capita income above a small value . 
  i guess those were not the issue . 
  oooh . 
  from banning chocolate importation to invading nato countries in one month . 
  that would be quick escalation indeed . 
  we got a world cup qualifier coming up , hmm . 
  if they do start ww3 do we get assigned a 3-0 win ? 
  i did not know that about porto . 
  i suspect if they have not done it till now it might be illegal . 
  otoh aut\u00e1rquicas this year !,

   to confirm the connection between the protests and the austerity measures , the experts studied the history of europe in almost a century -- 1919-2008 . 
  during this time , the continent has passed a difficult way from the constant social instability in the beginning of the century to the peace and prosperity in the pre-crisis period . 
   economists have examined all demonstrations , riots , acts of terrorism , government crises and attempts of revolutions that have taken place during this time . 
   the data showed the exact relationship between the reduction in government spending and political instability . 
  if costs are rising in the country the average of events are 1.4 . 
  if the cost reduction amounts to 1 % of gdp , the number of events increased to 1.8 . 
   if the costs are reduced by 5 % of gdp and more , it takes place in the year 3 and more major events . 
  what is happening in europe ? 
  after the 2008 crisis , a number of european countries began to promote a policy of austerity . 
   it is not just about greece , but also for other euro zone countries , not withstanding regime of austerity , including france and italy , not to mention spain and portugal . 
   this policy has recently been heavily criticized not only by analysts and experts , but also from the europeans . 
   however , german chancellor angela merkel , who set the tone in european politics , it seems , does not seek to depart from the principles of austerity and insists on its implementation by all eu countries . 
   this question , as well as the issue of migrants , is controversial , as some countries are increasing external debt , while others are forced to economize . 
   capacity of the external debt leads or may lead to a serious debt crisis , as in the case of greece . 
  in addition to greece , high external debt in countries such as portugal ( 232 % of gdp ) , cyprus ( 107 % of gdp ) , italy ( 144 % of gdp ) , spain ( 137 % of gdp ) . 
   looking at the recent unrest in some european cities , connected both to the situation of migrants around , and with the internal problems of the countries ( labor reform in france , clashes with police in germany ) , it can be said with certainty that the above theory is supported by analysts zerohedge . 
   therefore , many experts are sounding the alarm : the tension in society increases , and on the threshold of europe -- external danger in the form of lih , the fight against which is so important to the unity and cohesion . 
  and this is exactly what europe is now so lacking . 
  you should read the article ... it \u00b4 s actually very good, 
  what \u00b4 s wrong of being a eu of european countries ( except britain ) haven \u00b4 t we had this shit before in world history ? 
  ... why keep failing over and over again in the same mistakes ? 
  ... is not wise, 
  today ... cabo verde , tomorrow ... 
  the world ... wahahhahahahahahah, 
  [ infidels ] ( http://www.angelfire.com/hi5/interactive_learning/crucades2/crusadekks_files/titlecrusadestwo.gif ), 
  unbelievable stuff ... scary at least, 
   eu going to do , throw them out ? 
  you underestimate the power of money persuasion . 
  they don \u00b4 t even need a middle man to american jihads ... they buy the guns themselves ... `` france ? 
  hahahha ... don \u00b4 t worry about france , we have enough people there ! '', 
  of course it will , because it would be in an unjustifiable position with is members ; today the baltic countries , tomorrow france ... who could guarantee anything ? 
  this ends my internet for today, 
  brexit means uk it \u00b4 s official in a downturn, 
  the pull out of peripheral eu countries after the 2008 crisis was to gain some time ... looks like time run out , and the beast is biting the hand that feed her . 
  ** edit : ** put it another way : germany is down . 
  the last standing man is down . 
  let \u00b4 s be clear . 
  a formal invasion of a nato country would be unjustifiable to any alliance country . 
  what putin did in ukraine and georgia is to carefully exploit nato border country fragilities . 
  an invasion of a nato country can only have , and will only have one answer : war with the west . 
  i agree . 
  no one starts a nuclear war with the west , knowing that this means total destruction, 
  no one else has the balls or the brains to do it ... or no one else is that stupid, 
  makes sense ... but why not choose another beach ? 
  how can the uk be at the forefront when it didn \u00b4 t even entered the race ? 
  the uk was partially in the eu ... 
  spot on, 
  i share your opinion , but for this sub we \u00b4 re crazy , and you won \u00b4 t get a lot of karma for this, 
  this for the reddit experts is like water and oil ... they don \u00b4 t mix ... impossible to comprehend, 
  so referendum only when it \u00b4 s of the interest of some ... 
   might be that it should be for the people to have a direct say in it i think you should say : `` there \u00b4 re people that have an agenda on disrupting the most the eu process '' ... or to maintain coherence in his position , he has to defend the same referendum process to other issues that people consider pertinent ... let \u00b4 s finish once for all the representative democracy then, 
  thanks , makes more sense, 
  when i vote for someone in the parliament , i vote for his ideas , including ideas related to eu ... so i don \u00b4 t get your logic ; is this a representative democracy or are we going to have referendums for everything ? 
   citizens should choose , not parliaments i thought citizens choose when they voted for parliaments representatives ? 
  that \u00b4 s the basic idea of a representative democracy ... 
  so what \u00b4 s the missing link between the greek orthodox people and the iberia peninsula ... in the case of finland i can see the link , but here ? 
  women wearing a scarf in the head ? 
  we have that here , with the old women in the country side , especially in that time . 
  i thought it was because of the islamic invasions in our peninsula ... did you guys had that ? 
  are you pro brexit ? 
  where people need to go to make a living ... 
  i agree . 
  israel 's foreign policy is the bottom line of foreign policies ... very hard to go deeper than that, 
  ... or for a system that is unable to surpass mental problems . 
  independent scotland is as inevitable as brexit, 
  who cares ? 
  and the purge of erdogan ? 
  because terrorism is just an excuse to deploy troops , so they can help maintain order when factories close , institutions shut down partially ... 
  they need to keep demand for their car 's factories ... 
  so we need to choose between the ignorant masses or the orwellian elites ? 
  ... i \u00b4 m out , going to disappear in the woods , back to basics ... going to wait there for the armageddon, 
  the nightmare is coming true ... the average ignorant citizen is taking control ... now we \u00b4 re going down, 
  hey ... democracy !, 
  who cares ? 
  watching turkey news this days it \u00b4 s like watching a car riding on the wrong side of the highway ... it \u00b4 s going to crash soon , you just don \u00b4 t know when . 
  the european union project gave several decades of peace in europe , after 2 ww , where americans played a decisive role in the victory over the dark forces , played by nazi germany and mussolini \u00b4 s italy , and also in the building process of the devastation left by the war . 
  i don \u00b4 t know what \u00b4 s your agenda , and the agenda of people that try to paint americans as the bad guys on the wrong side of history , but clear tells something about those that try this approach . 
  i \u00b4 m not here defending the americans , responsible for a lot of bad that happens in the world today , but ignoring europe \u00b4 s dark past and it \u00b4 s inabilities to give an answer to his citizens ambitions , is not from someone straight, 
  who cares ? 
  the little men has spoken ...

  it \u00b4 s like as if ... they don \u00b4 t have a f *** clue how to respond to this threat, 
  what for ? 
  i hope this comes back to bite the people who did this to the soldiers, 
  is he declaring war on us ? 
  ... or how the french 's social fabric is breaking !, 
  i sincerely hope that the people that did this to the soldiers be butchered the same way ... 
  i want the best to turkey ; right now , i seriously doubt erdogan it \u00b4 s the best to turkey . 
  if i support a coup d'etat in turkey ? 
  depends on who \u00b4 s commanding the coup ... i \u00b4 m not here defending `` western values '' to turkey .

  so you think other tax payers should continue to feed greece indefinitely ? 
  specially when they see greece has so much homework to do that they are n't willing to do in the first place ? 
  do you pay property taxes ? 
  do you own a place ? 
  a car ? 
  just collect their goods ... my sister forgot to pay the car circulation fee 1 or 2 years and one of my fathers bank account ( the car was in his name ) was seized so he would pay the fee and the fine , something that costs 50 $ ended up costing nearly 500 $ , after he paid the account was unlocked so he could use it again . 
  do n't you understand that 's how modern states work ? 
  you guys are so immersed in being greek that you do n't even know anymore, 
  stop trying to tell us how bad it is ... it 's not that bad , go to romania or bulgaria and see it for yourself . 
  your minimum wage is higher than portuguese and your average salary is also higher than the portuguese ... 
  and 2 years and they still have n't done it ? 
  they either do n't want or their government are completely incompetent, 
  southern europe benefits the most from a weak euro, 
  98 % of the privatizations have n't been done . 
  only 33 % of the company opap was owned by the state, 
  because they also spend too much with the public sector , and they need to cut it . 
  hey yo dawg can you forgive my past loan ? 
  also can you give me more money ? 
  i 'll totally pay it back this time . 
  either someone in the imf is stupid or wants to provoke instability in the eu/ez . 
  exactly this , i think even germany understands greece do need a debt relief , but before that they have to address some issues , you quoted a few , there are more . 
  how is it possible that a country that needs money desperately has n't sold any of it 's public owned companies ? 
  all the other countries in the eu have done it , it 's been proved that public owned companies are not efficient , besides they are used to give jobs to the boys and friends ... 
  so the debt was used as leverage , do your homework , prove that you are willing and in good faith , then we can pardon part of the debt . 
  you speak as if everything is fine and does n't need fixing , as if only the payment of the loans is the problem ... they have huge problems in the public sector and in the taxing system . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  not sure if sarcastic or not, 
  i think for my self , i do n't need no prophet of doom . 
  that 's what you are . 
  1 . the greeks already got a debt haircut , portugal and ireland did n't 2 . their interest rates are lower than portugal 's and ireland 3 . same for the maturity of their loans , is higher than portugal 's and ireland 's 4 . it 's not about being cruel , quote me one cruel measure , unless you count paying taxes as being cruel 5 . there are countries in the eu with lower living standards than greece , some even contributed to the greek bailout , how are you going to say to the slovenians , maltese , estonians that the money they lent to greece is gone , or partially gone , because greeks do n't want to lose 10 % of their pensions , etc ? 
  i agree with a partial pardon of the greek debt , but we need to see action and reform before that : a ) the public sector in greece is a wasteland b ) the public sector has way too many weight in the economy , they need to privatize for the best deal c ) taxes , their tax base is n't large enough , there are too many people escaping taxes you speak of solidarity , every portuguese ( including children and old people ) contributed with 1.000 $ to the greeks , that 's higher than the average salary . 
  your view of the world is cartoonish and of stereotypes . 
  it 's not about politics it 's about economics , the greeks have too much homework to do before any debt haircut , their attitude of entitlement and arrogance is shameful . 
  and who the hell are you , the british , to speak about solidarity ? 
  when the countries in the eurozone have contributed with nearly 200 bn euros to greece ? 
  that was money out of the german , french , etc taxpayer directly to the greeks . 
  salazar colluded with both sides , that 's why the azores was handed over to the british/americans , that was of far more importance than any wolframium sold to the axis , plus timor and macau were occupied by the japanese . 
  because receiving 50 % is better than 0 % ... just because it 's not sustainable at 100 % or 80 % does n't mean you ca n't be paid ... they had to break tsipras , force him to reform , after that they can partially pardon the debt . 
  but 1st greece needs to show they are willing , which they had n't thus far . 
  if they had exited the euro there would be millions of greeks trying to understand why their former wage of 1.000 euros , now in drakmas , is n't enough to buy half of what they could previously buy . 
  you are incredible spoiled if you think a state can just borrow money and not pay it , or demand `` solidarity '' and ( yet ) another pardon ... 1 and a half century ago not paying your debt would give the other country a casus beli . 
  the arrogance you spill is incredible , the worst is that you think you are right !, 
  you took loans now you do n't want to pay them !, 
  you do n't want to reform anything !, 
  one of the worst public sectors in europe , lest efficient , people do n't pay taxes ( like property taxes , etc ) , one of the lowest reform ages !, 
  and you blame the germans !, 
  imagine dozens of banks going bankrupt , people losing their deposits , companies losing all the money and people losing their savings ... the damage this would cause to the economy , and it would have a domino effect that would affect even banks who did n't own greek debt , they just had to own debt to the banks involved ... 
  data shows on average greeks pay less taxe 's than the rest of europe , something like 34 % to 37 % . 
  but you ca n't just pour money into a machine were it leaks all around ... that 's what the greek economy is , a machine leaking everywhere , 30 gardeners to care for 4 bushs in a public hospital ? 
  the youngest age for pensionists ? 
  etc, 
  you had time to reform , you had time to sell the assets and you did n't ... all this years your governments were dragging their feet !, 
  and the latest government came to the eu like a gypsie trying to bluff and negotiate as if people had n't had enough , as if a greek exit was all that negative to europe . 
  your bluff got called out . 
  do your homework !, 
  it 's a fake surplus ... not reached by reforms , it was reached by finance engineering . 
  uh , and what 's new ? 
  you should have done that years ago like portugal and the other nations did , why do you want a public companies so politicians can fill them with boys and friends ? 
  greece needs to stfu , for years they have been testing the limits . 
  they bluffed for months and they nearly got what they deserved . 
  i would n't put portugal and greece in the same table ... you were living way above what you should . 
  portugal was n't , that 's why you had to cut more on the wages than we did . 
  the situation in portugal is improving , for me the most troubling factor is the debt , 130 % of gdp . 
  both , but greece needs to start reforming , all this could have been avoided if they had followed the plan . 
  unworkable ? 
  most seem to be doing fine , ireland had to bailout their banks - nothing related with the euro , portugal and greece both spent too much money in construction they did n't need , and in the case of greece they had a monstrosity that they called public service , not to mention other kind of waste of public money ... it 's nothing related with the euro . 
  edit : ofc having a currency of their own would permit more flexibility , but that 's another issue not related with the fouls of state . 
  send humanitarian aid without fueling the waste and the greek government , because sending money is easy . 
  we are talking about sending money to those really in need , if possible without the greek government as the middle man . 
  i 'm starting to think they want to exit the euro , but they know most greeks do n't want that and would n't support that move , so instead they keep playing and trolling . 
  they sure did , you are talking about the ecb money that was used to buy loans with higher rates from the banks , but the original loans were used for something ... 
  `` we just need money , lol '', 
  `` europeans should help the others in need '' money was sent . 
  `` they were sharp sharks and they should lose their money '', 
  money transferring to the periphery should be done via trade surplus , if it 's the other way around then the periphery is living above its capacity . 
  you do n't make enough money on your own to keep your life style . 
  you were living on money borrowed from your friends , now your friend wants his money and you say he is being unresenable and he should just keep on giving you money and pardon the debts . 
  you are that douche greece . 
  they think money comes from trees, 
  i was saying classic greece was n't just greece as we know it , it had territories in today 's turkey , italy etc. 
  we are going to pay it, 
  i have no hate towards the greek people , only the politicians , they are playing with your lives . 
  2 % in gdp cuts ? 
  that 's not correct, 
  why dont you guys leave already ? 
  i hope the no wins , but for different reasons , i wish you well though . 
  i hope the ` no ' wins because i want to see the social-economical experience irl , the caviar-left is gon na continue to live well and blame the evil europe , but the poor will suffer the most . 
  without reforms , any more money you receive will just vanish in the huge money waste machine that is your government . 
  because syrisa is fucking clueless , they look like amateurs, 
   it 's not their debt , it 's private debt that was socialised to protect a structurally unsound monetary union . 
  the imf also said you guys failed miserable at implementing the program in the first place , your government were dragging their feet . 
  not at all ... you mad ? 
  read my comment again . 
  yes nd and pasok have even more blame . 
  that does n't excuse syriza of playing countries, 
  i was n't being racist ... 
  am i lying ? 
  they also liked little boys ... there 's that too, 
  i 'm not saying greeks do n't work , i just find odd that some people try and keep drowning us on the `` we are starving , we are doing a lot of sacrificies '' so is a lot of people , there are currently contries in europe where their populations live worse than greeks and they have helped greece with bn of euros . 
  greeks , ottomans , you name it ... what i was trying to say is that classical greece had parts of turkey , italy , etc.

  i 'm sorry but this is a really stupid proposal , water is like any other commodity and should be privately owned . 
  you really think making it a public good will benefit society ? 
  that we wo n't all pay just the same ( or probably even more ) for the same service ? 
  i mean , what 's the logic behind nationalising water ? 
  do n't get me wrong , if that worked in bringing down the costs , i 'd be the first to sign it , but it just shifts those away and into taxes while also making the people handling the water a lot more unaccountable , the problem is that making it a public good wo n't do us any good , if it did , we 'd all have nationalised water and not only that . 
  one could just as well say `` food/land/transportation / healthcare/internet connection/cellphones/tooth-brushes are a public good , not a commodity '' and that would also make no sense whatsoever .

   shieeeeeeeeeeeeeeet i think you 're being too influenced by your swedish friends, 
  hey northern europeans , you know what 's even better than greece for tourism ? 
  portugal !, 
  i 'm sorry to say this but it 's true , we 're like greece but more welcoming , safer and cleaner !, 
  [ here , check this map about the safest countries in the world ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dd9gquc.jpg ) !, 
   and i ca n't even imagine all the people that have been re-allocated to raising statues instead of maintaining the infrastructure . 
  that and the money that will be taken away from the people which would otherwise be spent on productive activity which will now be spent on the megalomaniac buildings , it 's like ceausescu all over again !, 
   oh r/europe , you 're a fucking nazi rally . 
   austria fights about the name of a sausage . 
  you know what we all need ? 
  a common enemy so we stop all this bickering among us . 
   skopje 2014 has also generated controversy for its cost , for which estimates range from 80 to 500 million euros . 
  they 're only 2 million people and their gdp is only 7630 million euros !, 
  they must be insane !, 
   he is the pm so he knows nobody will look at his finances well what ? 
  he is the pm so he has all the opposition wanting to bring him down and all the media looking for a story , a pm must be of the people in society with the least amount of privacy , everybody is always digging on your past to see if they can find something or anything at all that can be used against you !, 
   this is spain we are talking about even the king has been stealing and i do n't see him steping down . 
  i do n't know about the monarchy but that 's something entirely different - pms are elected , can much more easily be deposed and have much more power . 
   in northern ireland a politician actually blames the ira militant irish republicans replacing beef with horse meat ? 
  ah , that 's just what the jews want you to believe !, 
  sorry , i 'll be back to r/conspiracy now . 
   i do n't know why you are being so downvoted . 
  it 's not like karma acts as currency , do n't worry , i wo n't be loosing sleep over the downvotes i get x )  if with that question , you mean that the taxes would show if he is or not corrupt , that is very naive as they certainly would n't . 
  you 're right , though him making that public certainly means he 's willing to cooperate . 
  heck , he 's the pm , he knows everybody will always be over him to find just the slightest thing to use as a political weapon , if he was indeed corrupt there would be no way he would ever remain in his office for long , think that you 're rajoy and you had indeed taken bribes , would n't you have resigned a long time ago and perhaps even left the country with all these charges coming your way if they were even remotely truthful ? 
  you 'd have to be insane not to , to actually remain in office and to try and deceive everybody with such a bounty on your head if you were indeed guilty of those accusations !,

why so much difference between belgium , and the netherlands and luxembourg ? 
  i agree . 
  it would be little weird if it was ... 
  i do n't think so . 
  it it were like that , france , or at least northern france would also show up very brightly colored . 
  the thought of going around a street of a small town in mexico with a furry costume is mildly amusing . 
  ha , look over there ... tiny little brazil . 
  well , when you have the us as an ally , it 's almost money being wasted here ... 
   the goal does n't need to be capable of prevailing in an all-in , damn-the-consequences war , but to be painful enough to attack that there will not be an attempt in the first place . 
  it 's why switzerland is not worth invading . 
   vietnam could n't beat the us in a war i agree with the analogy being made here , but vietnam is not a good example . 
  they 're an overseas countries with radically different terrain than the us , both of which were major factors that contributed to the us ' defeat . 
  ukraine and russia are n't even separated by a river , and they have the exact same weather , terrain , etc. 
  we have a town named cuba ...

  if you saw an economy with 50 % youth unemployment , and you saw an opportunity abroad , what would you do ? 
  this is not about being `` cool . '', 
  it 's about making a good living . 
  i do n't fault anybody for doing what 's best for themselves . 
  you , on the other hand , seem to be quite bitter about it . 
  the problem is not enough immigration . 
  it 's too much emigration . 
  young educated greeks are flocking to other eu countries because they have no future in greece . 
  as a result , the old and uneducated are left behind , and there 's no one left to pay their pensions . 
  they have more old people . 
  if you make the statistic `` public spending on pensions per 60 + year old '' , you 'll see that greek pensions are not actually that great . 
  breaking news : war breaks out in germany , poland , and 83 other countries !, 
   reasons are n't important . 
    reasons are the only important thing . 
  holy shit , can we just stop with the absolutes ? 
  why ca n't they be both important to a greater or lesser degree ? 
  yes . 
  africa and south america need to get their shit together . 
  if dutch people get to rule france , why not spain ? 
  greece is the entity that has made , so far , the most concessions in these negotiations . 
  they have crossed many of their election ` red lines ' . 
  talking about greek `` demands '' is contradictory and naive . 
   some of the report 's original ideas included : a single copyright valid across the entire eu ; placing works created by employees of government , public administration , and the courts as part of their official duty in the public domain ( that is , with no copyright ) ; allowing audio-visual quotation ( in online videos , for example ) ; enshrining freedom of panorama ( the ability to take pictures of public buildings and distribute them without permission of the architect ) ; and allowing the public to circumvent drm in order to make use of exceptions to copyright . 
  yes , yes , yes and yes !, 
   one defeat for reda is that her proposal to protect the freedom of panorama was not accepted . 
  instead , an amendment was adopted that stated `` commercial use of recordings of works in public spaces should require express permission from the rightsholders . '', 
  reda said this `` could threaten the work of documentary filmmakers and the legality of commercial photo-sharing platforms . '', 
  well , ca n't have everything ...  the report will now be voted on by the full european parliament on july 9 , where more amendments could be made . 
  the final text will then be sent to the european commission , which will use it as input for a legislative proposal on copyright reform , expected to appear by the end of the year . 
  anything could happen here , i do n't know about this . 
  that 's not really positive news ( except technically , because 1 %  0 % ) . 
  it 's damned if you do , damned if you do n't . 
  except if greece was given a debt haircut , lower interest rates , delayed payments , or all three . 
  creditors took a risk when lending to greece . 
  since it did n't work out , and they want their money back ( or most of it ) , they have to ease up on greece . 
  right now , they want to force greece into the same thing greece forced itself 4 years ago . 
  if they want their money back , they 'll have to recognize that austerity did n't work for greece , will not work again , and that they must cooperate with the greeks on a deal to end austerity and prevent a default and a grexit . 
  who 's number 1 ? 
   i could likely find a place in brazil with little effort , especially since one never knows when this european union we 've got going starts to crumble typical portuguese !, 
  when things get bad , just run away . 
   nobody from south america here do brazilians really use `` huehuehue '' ? 
  just because some disagree , it does n't mean they get to defy it by carrying out justice by their own hands . 
  if they want this to change , then they should vote for a party which would legalize these kinds of acts , because right now , it 's illegal to beat someone up for stealing something from you . 
  maybe the argument goes like this : gypsies are savages because they steal . 
  asians are savages because they beat up those who steal , instead of doing what every good ( read : white ) person would do , leaving it up to the police and the court . 
  gypsies and asians are bad , and europe does n't need this cultural enrichment .

  but it 's good that the law * can * be enforced . 
  all it takes for social attitude to change is for some media coverage of cases where parents hit their children . 
  it 's not over night that that will happen , but i hope it will . 
  `` advanced interrogation techniques with negative physical feedback '' is a lot harder to understand than `` torture . '', 
  we all do . 
  what 's your point ? 
  in the whole article , there 's not a single mention of terrorism or terror ( * ctrl + f terror * ) . 
  it 's fucking unbelievable . 
  the title says that what they did was `` fuel insecurity for political gains . '', 
  is it that hard to make a connection to terrorism ? 
  are they that stupid ? 
  my assumption was that people have differing opinions because they are different people , and the opinions neutral newspaper would reflect the election results . 
  turns out people are very easily manipulated . 
  question : the newspaper who seems to get closer to the actual election results is the sun . 
  given that , could we say that the sun is the most neutral and objective newspaper ? 
  snp is not on this graph because their voters do n't read any newspaper . 
  i long for the days when syria can participate in the eurovision . 
  in many countries , you ca n't fine them above the value of the damage caused . 
  i do n't remember the term , but i think it 's a thing . 
  but people do n't wait that long . 
  by the time it becomes public domain , the people who killed the author would be dead themselves . 
  i do n't think that 's a good reason to prolong copyright , but it does end the possibility of `` it 's not piracy if we kill him '' ( i doubt that would be a problem , though ) . 
  either way , they started spewing bullshit conspiracy theories when they got butt-hurt because they lost .

   [ ... ]  indeed , ** the definition of net neutrality has disappeared ** , even though the text begins by recalling the necessity of an open and non discriminatory internet and an equal process of all internet traffic . 
  likewise , ** provisions on specialised services are very blurred and equivocal ** and may be used by operators and large online services to circumvent net neutrality and harm consumers ' freedom of choice as well as competition and innovation . 
  this is bad , very bad . 
  the council managed to lobby the euparl into capitulating to big companies on this issue . 
   therefore it is important to have future proof rules which , while fully safeguarding the open internet , allow market operators to provide services with specific quality requirements in order to provide them in safe manner . 
  it is not a question of fast lanes and slow lanes - as paid prioritisation is not allowed , but of making sure that all needs are served , that all opportunities can be seized and that no one is forced to pay for a service that is not needed . 
  they allow prioritization for `` services with specific quality requirements '' , for which iptv and voip would qualify . 
  prioritization is effectively the same as degradation of the remaining traffic . 
  my point still applies . 
  it 's still not enough . 
  the parliament 's suggestion was ideal , but the council had to water it down and screw everyone over . 
  that 's sad . 
  also , the netherlands is actually going to * lose * some of their net neutrality rights , which is also bad . 
  let 's hope they block the bill until net neutrality is fixed . 
  i doubt it - once the telecoms law passes , it wo n't be revisited for a * long long * time . 
  traffic prioritization only makes sense if you have a very bad connection to a customer , and want to make sure the user gets iptv or voip without noticing the bad connection , no matter if their internet is slow as hell . 
  well , guess what - that 's a way for your isp to screw you over , wash its hands of the problem , * when in reality it should make sure the infrastructure is up to modern standards and does n't require prioritization at all * . 
  and guess what - you now have no legal recourse if this happens . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  cdns have * nothing * to do with network neutrality . 
  cdns are `` fast '' but they are not prioritized at isp-level . 
  the reason they are fast is because you distribute your static content ( images , css , etc ) over many servers all over the world , and these servers have more outgoing bandwidth capacity ( bigger links ) , as well as are optimized to deliver static content very quickly ( lots of caching , ram , etc ) . 
  the main server might be much farther away from the client ( so inherently slower ) , and only needs to worry about dynamic content ( which is usually much smaller in size ) . 
  but once the traffic leaves the server 's or cdn 's outgoing link , ** it is always treated alike ** . 
  net neutrality means your isp can not prioritize certain traffic above others - the current rules allow it to prioritize `` important traffic '' , and that means it 's not network neutral . 
  now , maybe the definition for `` important traffic '' is n't bad , but imagine the consequences of maybe declaring `` youtube '' or `` skype '' specifically to be important traffic and for it to be faster or cheaper ( not count towards your monthly bandwidth ) . 
  now , any competitor has a huge hurdle to jump , and most likely will be unable to compete . 
  anyways , traffic prioritization only makes sense if you have a very bad connection to a customer , and want to make sure the user gets iptv or voip without noticing the bad connection no matter if their internet connection is slow as hell . 
  well , guess what - that 's a way for your isp to screw you over , wash its hands of the problem , * when in reality it should make sure the connection is up to modern standards and does n't require prioritization at all * . 
  i did n't mean to imply you had written it - i was just pointing out their wording is simply wrong . 
   why are the new net neutrality rules the strongest in the world ? 
  are n't the net neutrality rules in the us actually stronger ? 
  `` disappoint '' is the understatement of the year . 
  anything short of full-blown net neutrality is bad , very bad . 
  our tech companies will suffer for it . 
  damn the council . 
  they kept insisting and insisting , and held up roaming charges as a bargaining chip - they did n't want to pass them unless the parliament agreed to crippling net neutrality . 
  and damn the euparl for giving in . 
  in the end , they probably think that the roaming charges are worth it , because a `` normal citizen '' will notice them more than net neutrality , at least in the short term . 
  it 's very sad that the eu wo n't get full-blown guaranteed network neutrality . 
  i personally think it would have been worth it to sacrifice the roaming charges bad instead , if it meant we got full net neutrality everywhere in the eu . 
  a bad deal , in the end , net neutrality is more important than a roaming charges ban , and we get the second but not the first :  the sides decided that sequestering will be acceptable , as long as it does n't affect `` general '' quality of internet access this is so vague there basically is n't any guarantee of net neutrality in europe , and that 's very very bad . 
  i 'd be interested in reading the actual text - i 'm worried whether the council succeeded in removing all references to the term `` network neutrality '' , as was proposed before . 
  screw the council . 
  two can play at that game :  it 's like if i made a poll that says `` do you want to receive 1000 $ from steve ? '', 
  and then i go to steve and say that he has to give each and every one of the people who voted 1000 $ , or else he 's being undemocratic as a majority voted ` yes ' . 
  but lets forget these stupid comparisons as they over-simplify the problem and can be spun both ways , so they 're just a waste of time . 
  a poll where the `` no '' is being campaigned as being the choice you should pick if you want a better deal , that 's ridiculous . 
  a `` better '' deal would never pass in the creditor countries ' parliaments , especially the member states with a lower quality of life than current-day greece . 
  if you think a `` no '' will give greece a better deal , you 're delusional . 
  and many will then blame the ez and call them `` undemocratic '' and `` not accepting the will of the greek people '' if `` no '' wins and the creditors do not offer a better deal ( as they have said multiple times they wo n't ) . 
  i do n't mind the referendum itself - i think it 's a great idea ( though should probably have been scheduled a few days earlier , so that there would still be time to pay the imf ) . 
  it 's just sad to see it being spun as `` yes to current deal '' , or `` no , a better deal '' , when it 's obvious that 's not what it 's going to be ( and everyone but the greek government agree ) . 
  a fair , neutral referendum should be a `` yes to current deal ( austerity ) '' or `` no , we default ( new drachma , devaluation ) '' question , * that * would be democratic for both greece and the creditor nations , as the greek people would know exactly what they were voting for , instead of being mislead into delusions that the creditors would be bound into giving them much better conditions if `` no '' wins . 
   collaterized loan though the collateral are greek state bonds , which are worthless ( according to all rating agencies ) and all ecb rules already state those are not valid collateral outside of a bailout program . 
  the only reason they were still being accepted was because the board of governors was disobeying the rules completely under the justification that a deal was going to be reached `` soon '' , and no member state complained as everyone knew it was the only reason greek banks still had n't collapsed , and were hopeful for a deal . 
  so i can see why he considers the loans to be `` free money '' . 
  from what i know , the plan has always been to pay on time - the `` ultimatum '' was probably exactly that , if they did n't have a deal in 48h , they 'd be going into arrears . 
  from what we 've heard from both sides , that 'd make sense . 
   this for the very near future that 'd be great . 
  but it actually means a short-term * much worse * than this . 
  as in , `` no money to import food and so food prices skyrocket and * everyone * except the rich starves '' - worse . 
  i think they 've already realized that it 's impossible for greece not to go into arrears with the imf , so any new deal would consist of paying the imf after tuesday and hoping nobody cares . 
  either that , or they have found a way around the rules to get the money to greece fast , and are just waiting for an agreement . 
  if there is a deal , it would take time to be able to give the money to greece to pay the imf debt . 
  the ecb board of governors would have to vote on whether to give the central bank profits from greek debt back ( which could take a day ) , and any further payments would have to go through all ez national parliaments . 
  that 's probably the reason for the 48 ( instead of 96 ) hours - as afterwards greece would probably never get the money on time for the imf payment . 
  the problem is , the council has nothing to lose . 
  the average person knows nothing about what happens in the council , many do n't even know the council exists ( or that it is different from the commission or the parliament ) , as such the council can do whatever they want , while national governments blame `` the eu '' . 
  during the national elections nobody cares about what their government did in the council - any punishment by the electorate is given during the following euparl elections instead , even though the euparl usually stand up against such pushes by the council . 
  the `` democratic deficit '' in the eu is mostly caused by this fact , and i 've always found it funny how eu-sceptics who keep using the `` democratic deficit '' argument always want to give the council more power . 
  same , the english part of the press conference is n't at all disagreeable . 
  the english part of the conference does n't seem that disagreeable . 
  i 'd still be interested in reading the rest of the conference ( where he supposedly says that he feels `` betrayed '' and such , and i 'd like to check the context ) , sadly no translations as of yet . 
  [ the juncker press conference is actually worth reading . 
  ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_speech-15-5274_en.htm ) the guardian article makes it seem like he spent most of his time expressing how betrayed he felt . 
  most of the conference , however , was spent explaining what proposal was on the tables and all the effort/negotiation that went into it . 
  yes , it 's about setting the precedent . 
  and it turns out greece does not have the economic strength to force the precedent * they * want . 
  it is n't inherently bad , except when your purchasing power effectively drops over half in a single day , after switching currencies like that . 
  the uk is n't in the eurozone . 
  ah , okay , thanks . 
  that 's good , 
   we can not therefore conclude that the fault lies solely with greece i agree . 
  this mess does not have a single `` cause '' . 
  reality is never simple like that . 
  `` right '' ? 
  sorry , but tone is n't conveyed very well through text , so i 'm really not sure if you 're agreeing with me , or that 's supposed to be sarcasm . 
  care to explain ? 
  i 'm not saying it wo n't work , but that it will require them officially exiting the eurozone , as they are not allowed to use a second currency while inside , as far as i know . 
   25 % of gdp primary budget surplus is that a typo ? 
  because such a number is impossible . 
  a 25 % surplus is miraculous . 
  [ for example , forbes reported a primary deficit in february . 
  ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/02/16/greece-still-has-a-vast-problem-it-doesnt-have-a-primary-budget-surplus/ ), 
  sure , but ecb has to cut off ela access to greece once greece defaults on ecb debt , $ 3.5 bn of which is due on the 20th of july . 
  and that would * technically * be a default , as far as i know . 
  even then , the rules are already stretched so thin , that it 's very likely that even if ela is n't cut-off , they will stop increasing the limits due to the fact that greece broke the negotiations unilaterally ( all previous increases were passed on the grounds that a deal would very likely be imminent ) , which will result in the same situation . 
  anyways , my point was that if such a cut-off happens , greece is never going to be able to stay in the euro . 
  not whether such a cut-off will happen or not .

  great story , wish this type of integration programmes could be more common . 
  spain has/had a strong internal market . 
  plus they did n't had laws against industrialization like we did . 
  go ahead and volunteer youself then . 
  we do n't need more expansionist wars in the 21st century . 
  afterall foreign occupation of a country always gos well . 
  as most of them do n't consider reformism ( ergo taking part in elections ) they do n't have any public expression apart from strikes , marches or the occasional street fighting . 
  in various part of the globe there are several far left insurgencies like the farc ( they 'll put downs their weapons if colombians agree with the agreement via referendum ) , the naxalite maoist army in india ( and they are big ) , the pkk in turkey and so on . 
  even in europe we had our own share . 
  of course afterall having a puppet dictator always lead to stable regimes that respect human rights . 
  plus once he dies the transition will surely be swift and calm . 
  this plan is not more than a pipe dream for orban to try to deflect any responsibilities hungary might take regarding the refugee situation . 
  we ca n't play neocolonialism in a country divided between tribal , geographic and islamics . 
  they have enough on their plate . 
   legally a power sharing agreement between factions oh i 'm sure the other government in tobruk will surely put down their weapons when the mighty orban says so . 
  it 's amazing how most people did not learn a thing from operation iraqui freedom . 
  you mean the one that lost last month ras la nouf and other border towns next to sirte ? 
  the one that 's primarily composed by militias ? 
  if anything our decline started with northern european competition on africa , south america and more important asia . 
  the iberian union did n't help out when we had to be dragged into spanish wars . 
  but for me the more important factor was throwing away our industry in the first years of the 18th century . 
  the discovery of humongous gold reserves on brazil and the methuen treaty killed whatever internal production we had . 
  later on in the second half with the pombaline reforms that too went to shit with the peninsular war and the royal exile on rio . 
  contrary to the urban myth scandinavian societies were wealthy on its own right . 
  namely with industrialization in the 19th century . 
  having a lot of wealth is n't good per se . 
  i do n't consider equatorial guinea a good place just because their gdp per capita is inflated by the oil ( that ends up in the usual pockets ) . 
  even spain in the siglo de oro was repeatedly having bankruptcies due to poor economic mismanagement and superfluous spending . 
  check out the impact of the south american gold in the inflation . 
  as in spain most of our wealth ended up in other european countries because of imports . 
  importing italian art , french and english finished good as well as importing most of our wheat was catastrofic for the initial internal production . 
  our vulnerable manufactures could n't compete with cheaper and better made imports . 
  education works when the private sector pays reasonable salaries rather than 600-800 euros for a engineer or lawyer . 
   it all started with the french invasions and independence of brazil . 
  till that point portugal was fairly rich . 
  nah the country was never rich , when the dutch were building a prosperous capitalist society our economy relied on royal monopolies and spending the gold in white elephants . 
  remember the magnificent churches , papal embassies or palaces . 
  till the late 1990s the state was still the center of the universe ( not that 's bad but when state companies are sources of mismanagement and corruption it 's terrible ) . 
  i 'm not hopeful for the future unless serious reforms happen in portugal and the eu . 
  it 's nice our expressways are good ( and only those because the secondary network is a disgrace ) but we spent too much eurofunds and national resources in those . 
  for example we have a incomplete third expressway ( a32 ) from porto to lisbon . 
  now most people use the crumbling one ( in algarve the en 125 paralell to the new a22 ) as the fees are too expensive . 
  we 're japan without the weebs or good public transport . 
  for me it was the little syrian girl crying about her family in syria . 
  how she has nightmares when she hears airplanes and such . 
  hindu is solely for those who follow the religion . 
  we wo n't call a muslim or a christian indian hindu . 
  and what about indians that are n't hindu ? 
  of course but the refugee status is for anyone even if they 're out of the eu . 
  if your eligible then you have the right to claim asylum in any eu country . 
  join the club pal . 
  ffs hungary would n't even had to receive more than a thousand of refugees . 
  plus all the money is payed by the eu . 
  you do realize that the northern african countries are n't vulnerable like the used to be right ? 
  in about 2 months morocco will open it 's first tgv line , algeria is full of money and investing in its cities and i doubt tunisia will import another problem as its new democracy has its plate full of terrorists . 
  and as a result you get a far-right populist ready to implode the european union ? 
  in what conceivable way would le pen be better than sarkozy ? 
  yeah calling a 68 lady invalid for having a flu it 's totally reasonable . 
  yeah that 's the one i trust too . 
  the per capita does n't hold though . 
  for a big country like brazil 12 billion euros is a tiny fraction of the yearly budget while for hungary it 's a big hole . 
  for example hungary 's economy is about 120 billion dollars . 
  even with london 's budget ( 14,600 million dollars ) the cost would be about 10 % of the national budget . 
  the olympics are a sinkhole and most of them leave white elephants that need maintenance in the decades to follow . 
  not really . 
  you have to see the state wide polls . 
  trump is n't capable of having most of the electoral votes nor does has a strong position in battleground states . 
  you forgot to insert the tidbit about soros and the globalists . 
  i 'd rather have a cripple like eisenhower or a drug addict like jfk than the obese buffon . 
  i agree , he says different things to different publics . 
  but some how his supporters think he has a coherent position in foreign affairs . 
  in america only internal politics matters . 
  they 're not like the rest of the planet . 
  of course . 
  in the european council the chef is merkel and rest follow the procession . 
  trump declared that he would erradicate isis and some how get the oil . 
  you can also notice the difference as americans describe the state as the government . 
  really ? 
  you think most americans give a damn about the president of the europarl ? 
  most dont even known what the eu is . 
  it 's a shame but worse is that no one will take a stand . 
  even the eu sweeps the issue as a hungarian matter when clearly they do n't intend to at least give humane conditions for vulnerable refugees . 
  before you can them all single males read the article . 
  not even families with babies or elderly have proper condition to appeal for refugee status . 
  is there something in tangiers from the colonial or the independent city state period ? 
  especially something not physical like different traditions . 
  they probably support some sort of ethnic cleansing which usually falls very quickly in pogroms or killings . 
  or in other words : not living . 
  and that 's all that matters . 
  roma does not mean that they 're roman . 
  but dont you feel the same with gysies that mean egyptians ? 
  anyway words change with time . 
  the queer community embraced the term . 
  while others dont like derogatory terms . 
  lol even greece or turkey could be considered more roman than romania . 
  and romania isnt the roman empire so i guess they too should change their name . 
  thanks, 
   when viorel romanescu last year fled his romanian village , he did n't follow the well-trod path to western europe like his fellow roma . 
  instead , he sold his pig and horse , and bought a plane ticket to mexico . 
   he walked across the border from tijuana , surrendered to u.s. border agents and applied for asylum .

  america has been doing some bad shit for say a hundred years at best . 
  russia has been enslaving , pillaging and invading its neighbours for hundreds of years !, 
  are you even being serious when saying that ? 
  that 's like saying portugal and spain are evil because what they did in south america ... 
  i 'm sorry but i see everything after spain / france as east, 
   probably because they 're just two circles really got your pattern , 
  last time i saw in history books the united states had been a colony of the uk . 
  do you think the us would be missed if it never existed ? 
  yeah and geographically azores can be considered the most western point of europe because they have islands that are on the european side of the frontier with american and african plates . 
  so you want to talk about any wars in the eu ? 
   and there have n't really been 70 years of peace `` on the continent '' ; there have been 70 years of peace only in western europe . 
  we really are talking about eu here and not europe . 
  i had the idea that the time span was shorter ( always learning ) but the point stands being it 50 or 100 years . 
  because it 's different . 
  as you said and it 's true , we ca n't force eu on anyone while anyone that wanted to be american could , if they could get the visa . 
  that 's why eu is such an ambitious project because it 's based on diplomacy and democracy and not based in a war or an independence to get to be something . 
  yeah , i 'm no expert in usa 's history but if i had to bet i would say that virginia is an exception along with 3 or 4 states . 
    very strong different cultures  not really . 
  it 's not like we are trying to federalize venezuela with ireland . 
  venezuela is probably culturally closer to spain and portugal than greece ... cultures in europe are very strong and different . 
  the difference is that we learned to live with those differences and to integrate with each other . 
   many of them were semi independent colonies ( ne ) . 
  others were parts of non english political entities ( tx ) . 
  so you are proving my point ...  the us does n't even have an official language . 
  english is the dominant of course not going to argue with that but there are spanish speaking areas in the south too . 
  yet english and spanish count as almost 95 % of people 's main language while in eu english , german , french , italian and spanish do n't even come close to 70 % . 
  with language come very different cultural particularities . 
  of course that there are differences from north to south in usa too but so there are in portugal . 
  however , in eu they are much bigger . 
  having a project that is making us come together while we have all these differences is a really huge thing . 
  were any of those states been a country on their own or have more than 50 years history before the federalization ? 
  ca n't really compare a region that has been at war since forever , has countries that almost have a thousand years history and very strong different cultures . 
  eu has 24 official languages ... eu is a union that was funded in diplomacy while usa turned in what it is today from a civil war . 
  hard to find a more ambitious project anywhere in the world that has been going on for half a century . 
  it 's not perfect but it is pretty good . 
  well it was a priest, 
  well i never had ac and i sleep comfortably every year . 
  i happen to spend most of august in spain too and no ac needed to sleep comfortably . 
  neither spain or portugal are some kind of australia of europe . 
  really do n't know what you experience is but it 's not correct . 
  are you from england ? 
  how would you feel if some journals from germany or france , grouped england and a couple of other countries that happen to have something in common and , started calling you ( england ) a member of the retarded club ? 
  you would not like it and would feel insulted . 
  it would not just be an acronym . 
  do n't use an insult with the excuse that other people use them . 
  it 's an acronym that is also an insult . 
  anyone with a neuron understands what is the full intent of using that acronym . 
   there are plenty of differences between these situations but i have n't heard a single one justifying the annexation of gibraltar . 
  neither i was talking about annexation . 
  op compared gibraltar with melilla and ceuta , and i pointed out a big difference between them making them incomparable . 
  there is a very interesting relation between with gibraltar and oliven\u00e7a . 
  while gibraltar was ceded to britain at the time , oliven\u00e7a was occupied and ceded back to portugal in the treaty of utrecht . 
  however spain never gave up control of oliven\u00e7a to portugal . 
  in portugal in this particular affair is common to say that uk will only cede gibraltar after spain cedes oliven\u00e7a to portugal . 
  gibraltar 's nt even plays in portugal . 
  you could actually create a bridge between main land spain and ceuta , it 's pretty self explanatory . 
  explanations for what really ? 
  pointing out they are different when they are it 's natural when people try to compare them . 
  since i do n't know the history behind i ca n't really have an opinion . 
  however , it 's very strange that there is overseas territory like that . 
  still , you ca n't compare a territory with almost the size of portugal with one with 6km ^ 2 with a rock within ... 
  azores is an island an was uninhabited it 's very different , berlin was a special case that is n't comparable . 
  op was comparing gibraltar with ceuta and melilla and i was poiting out that there is a very big difference from a geographical point of view . 
  islands ? 
  being the only exceptions french guiana from what i recall . 
  well if you actually look at the map you can see the difference . 
  ceuta could actually have a bridge connecting with spain 's main land and even melilla is still very close to main land spain . 
  on the other hand gibraltar is much smaller and is more than 1000km away from england, 
  they are n't really the same, 
  you can look at the map and see a big difference . 
   also , calling a fairly respected and definitely successful politician a half-wit does little to further the discussion . 
  well if he is , he should behave like one and not an half-wit xenophobic politician . 
  it 's not out of context it 's actually very well contextualized . 
   `` during the crisis of the euro , the countries of the north have shown solidarity with countries affected by the crisis , '' he said . 
  `` as a social democrat , i attribute exceptional importance to solidarity . 
  `` but you also have obligations . 
  `` you can not spend all the money on drinks and women and then ask for help . '', 
  names should n't be translated in first place but ok i understand your point . 
  this is pretty nice but should use the original names . 
  was googling ferdinand magellan to understand who he was but yeah fern\u00e3o de magalh\u00e3es ... 
  shhhh that 's a secret, 
  you brazilian ? 
  you can always complain to roman empire that pilled the gold in iberia . 
  even though most of the work is in portugal , the head office is in london that 's why . 
  neither portugal and spain have anything to win with being very strict as both want to continue to have british tourists and pensioners . 
  stopping having that would be a significant blow on the economy that is very fragile . 
  portugal always had a positive relationship with britain too so there is that too . 
  be it left or right portuguese position would be the same . 
  do you really think that portugal is with primary deficit ? 
  portugal in 2016 was forecasting 2,6 primary surplus if i recall correctly . 
  eu does n't really change bondrates , maybe you are mistaking with euro . 
  i do n't think you have a slight idea about what you are talking about, 
  yes in western europe . 
  do you even have an idea ? 
  in 1986 portugal joined eec and at the moment in 10y bound was paying ~ 15 % . 
  at that moment uk was paying ~ 10 % , italy ~ 11 % , france ~ 8 , germany ~ 6 % , denmark ~ 10 . 
  remember that portugal in 1986 was only 12 year apart from a 41 year dictatorship ( that closed the country from all world ) , loss of colonies and an ultramarine war . 
  no one had , not just portugal, 
  i understand your point but you have to remember what caused all these crisis and by this i 'm not taking out some of the responsibility of those countries . 
  in my opinion , more than being really strict with 3 % deficit , eu should be really strict with what we all in here `` desor\u00e7amenta\u00e7\u00e3o '' ( you can understand this as `` unbudget '' ) .

does anyone here know if this will be implemented in the uk ? 
  ( until brexit actually happens , the uk is a full ue member , with all rights and also all obligations , right ? ), 
  i also feel at home in spain , and i visit all the time . 
  the one thing i think is really different is the coffee . 
  damn your coffee is bad . 
  not really , not in the younger generations anyway . 
  never could understand . 
  we are probably the most equal of all independent nations in europe , culturally speaking . 
  this is great news . 
  ( we will * always * benefit from a stronger spain , no matter what some ill-informed people think over here ) . 
  these are all period trams , restored and kept in working condition . 
  there are a total of 3 lines using old trams in porto , and many people use them as their everyday means of transportation , although they * are * a tourist magnet . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trams_in_porto ) you can find a nice article about the system . 
  born and live in porto so a bit biased . 
  if you are looking for a genuine , mostly unspoiled city with character , then porto is an excellent choice . 
  but do check pictures and other traveler 's impressions . 
  told with the best words . 
  it 's true . 
  most likely he was projecting his own behavior when he comes south . 
  no wonder he has a large alcohol bill , if he needs to pay for his women . 
  well , the thing is , nearly all the continent already speaks english . 
  we can just use it as a tool , disregarding all the cultural load attached . 
  believe me , we can do it , and it works . 
  and considering , as a portuguese , how difficult it is to be understood even in spain ( bear in mind that portuguese and spanish are probably as close as you can get between `` major '' languages ) , that is something to be said . 
  why , you 're using it , silly . 
  wine in the south , vodka up north , and , though they are leaving , gin is also great . 
  maybe whisky ( not whiskey ) will leave and come back , who knows ? 
  as to beer , it is everywhere !, 
  * all * of these were invented where ? 
  why in europe of course . 
  cheers !, 
  this is a rabbit hole that i fell into a couple of months ago . 
  took a bit to really start enjoying it ... but it does pay to persist . 
  currently finishing toll the hounds ... just two more to go ... 
  no mayo or ketchup can match the taste of chips bathed in a good francesinha sauce . 
  and now i 'm hungry even though i just had lunch ... 
  ... every two years , for a full month , you adjust your entire schedule to the euros or world cup . 
  uh , surely you meant 600 thousand . 
  just sayin ' . 
  it 's unexplainable , but it is yuge . 
  we have the best fortresses . 
  they 're yuge . 
  yuge fortresses . 
  in absolute terms , true . 
  but keep in mind that in the 15th and 16th centuries , europe * was * pretty much `` the world '' , and stayed so until the 20th century , as far as `` superpowers '' go . 
  no , we would n't . 
  we did n't have the demographics to sustain a large empire for more than a century , let alone becoming a super power . 
  as it was we got * very * lucky in some of our colonies - keeping brasil as a colony up to 1822 was quite an extraordinary feat , only possible by a series of historical mishaps . 
  anyway ... we had a good run for a such a small , peripheral country . 
  this . 
  the proselytism in religions ( almost all of them ) is the starting point of so many problems we have in the world today . 
  to have it at a state level is simply not a very good idea . 
  or rather , it is actually a terrible idea . 
  now , considering that the us is the only real world superpower ... it is scary as hell . 
  holy shit !, 
  ( no pun intended ), 
  not natural at all , i agree . 
  but here in portugal , ( maybe in spain it 's the same ? ), 
  in spite of having a clear state/church separation , it 's still common practice to have a bishop 's blessing ( or even a mass !! ), 
  when inaugurating public buildings , for example . 
  it bothers me to no end . 
  people tell me `` it 's cultural man , no big deal '' , but still , it makes me cringe , every time i see it . 
  no doubt . 
  let 's not even go into electric vehicles , where a torque converter is n't needed at all . 
  actually , most really powerful sports cars use automatic transmission nowadays . 
  it 's a matter of better managing the huge torque . 
  however , manual also has advantages and is more fun to drive if you ca n't afford the latest ferrari or lamborghini though . 
  i find your lack of portugal disturbing . 
  also , it is probable that he really knew nothing of interest for intel agencies that they ca n't reconstruct from other sources . 
  edit : a typo, 
  uhm , actually , we are quite an exception in europe right now . 
  a small country with a left-wing government that is making the economy grow * and * lower the deficit . 
  we have social peace and welcome refugees . 
  what an oddball we are . 
  extreme heat is no fun at all , even if it 's dry . 
  i 've been at 47\u00bac in pinh\u00e3o , in the douro valley , when i was in my early teens . 
  got stuck there waiting for a train to porto for about three hours in the early afternoon . 
  shit was messed up . 
  totally still air . 
  our shoes would get stuck in the melting tarmac . 
  no ac in any cafe either in those days . 
  to this day , it 's my definition of hell on earth . 
  all this post-brexit freedom is lifting us higher and higher !, 
  but wait ... what is this humidity i feel ?? 
  ( dissolves into rain ), 
  not that i know of . 
  but i 've heard this very notion from americans before . 
  it 's like , `` we have everything we might possibly need in the us , why should we bother with the rest of the world ? '' . 
  i 'm not saying this is wrong or right . 
  just that it is a thing . 
  true enough . 
  but i would say that the vast majority of europeans ( at least , those that regularly use the internet ) can accurately point out california , ny , florida or texas on a map ; not knowing italy , france or greece are countries is n't even in the same league , given the cultural importance of these countries in the shaping of the modern world , and in the case of france , the importance it had in the very creation of the united states . 
  anyway . 
  just my 2 ( euro ) cents . 
  well , i do n't think it 's a question of being `` dumb '' , just `` cultured '' . 
  many americans see themselves as the center of the world , so why bother knowing anything about the rest of it ? 
  it has nothing to do with intelligence or scientific knowledge . 
  it has to do with a kind of self reliance that is both admirable and damaging . 
  it 's almost as if the whole country took some kind of karma-bath . 
  it 's quite scary really .

  this comment was lit . 
  rightly so . 
  i need this as a bed story . 
  and what is up with people saying cut penis looks better ? 
  i have an uncut penis and i can simply pull the foreskin back without a problem and it would look just like a cut penis . 
  lol, 
  invite her to portugal , that 'll change her view drastically . 
  foreigners are absolutely loved in portugal . 
  edit : it 's kinda funny she thinks portuguese people go to her country just to fuck with their women , when , in reality portuguese people mostly migrate to work . 
  she probably mistook a portuguese guy for a south american guy . 
  that 's exactly what i do . 
  just before yesterday the uv radiation was insane . 
  on my way out i had to dress up a jacket even though it was insanely hot .

  while northern europe tries to find ways to reduce their muslim population - portugal does it without even knowing how . 
  : ^ ) ( we know ), 
  but if portugal is spain and spain is n't a country , that makes portugal not a country as well . 
  portugal is right next to the atlantic ocean , so i doubt sharks exist near portugal . 
  : ^ ) but on a serious note : [ yes , there are . 
  but they do not come ashore . 
  they cross portuguese waters but do not get close to the coast because portugal is not a destination itself for them , rather is a passing-trough point on the way towards reproduction and hunting spots such as the mediterranean and the nordic sea .

  jesus christ ... england should bring back the infamous torture method called hanged , drawn and quartered for people like these .

  are you from the future ? 
  what happened to portugal ?

  did we get swallowed by the ocean ?

  no , i 'm not happy .

  yeah and it has more crime in a single day than portugal in a week quite likely . 
  a bad joke . 
  hey , maybe we can replace germany with angola . 
  edit : and yes , i 'm too salty right now . 
  you triggered me by saying that you would prefer to have brazil instead of portugal in europe . 
  yeah sure . 
  instead of having the 5th safest country in the world in europe , you 'll have one of the most dangerous countries in the world but now in europe .

  i once spent 2 hours outside in the sun layed in a beach towel with my backs turned to the sun . 
  because of that i got something called `` hell 's itch '' from then on i never left to the beach without sunscreen . 
  edit : and this happened to me as a portuguese guy who 's used to hot temperatures . 
  best of luck !, 
  hopefully it all turns well for you . 
  i said that based on how portugal was doing a few years ago . 
  i was n't comparing it to other european countries whatsoever . 
  in portugal we are doing fairly well at the moment , and we 're still evolving and getting better !, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_portuguese_flags portugal did it [ first !, 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/portugueseflag1095.svg ), 
  there are also a lot of girls here who love foreigners , especially irish . 
  even i get insanely burned here . 
  that 's why i take extra care if i 'm going to the beach . 
  you can always come to portugal . 
  do n't worry italy , we portuguese people love you .

  therefore , greek bonds are very high risk assets for which investors are rightfully expected to ask higher yields . 
   b , fall out and got to war i honestly doubt this would happen . 
  there is no reason for conflict between eu states right now . 
  in the case of a dismantlement of the eu , i 'm sure states would just proceed to negociate trade and movement arrangements and go on with their life . 
   so many `` europeans '' on here these days . 
  yeah , fuck off mate . 
  people are n't more or less european because they disagree with your political wet dreams . 
  you technocratic fascist , respect greece 's democracy and sovereignty , plus this is all the eu 's fault ( or maybe now it 's russia 's fault since that 's the scapegoat now ) , austerity does not work , let 's solve the debt by taking in more debt and increase internal consumption , the debt was not legitimate in the first place , countries ca n't be run like a company anyway , etc etc. ... no patience or sympathy for them , especially coming from another poor southern european country which did n't have anywhere near as much leeway given during economic hard times . 
  oh , i meant it 's probably true in regard to drunken brits starting shit , not the comments about the spanish police . 
  doubt it 's fake news , if algarve during the summer is anything to go on . 
  every year when summer rolls by , news are filled with british white trash starting fights , vandalizing everything and generally being shit tier humans in algarve , especially albufeira which is the cheapest of the algarve destinations and draws the biggest chav/slag crowd . 
   i do n't know , try asking germans and other european politicians why they let hundreds of thousands random people with unknown background in holy shit i saw the smoke all the way from the main page, 
  i had a stomach ache last night , those damned russians are at it again . 
   by far right nutjobs people all from the left to the right voted for brexit . 
  eurosceptics is n't endemic to the right wing . 
  the most eurosceptic party in portugal is the communist party . 
  because europe is in the midst of a very serious discussion about immigration policies . 
  in portugal the north is actually much more conservative and votes nearly exclusively right wing , but the rest holds accurate . 
  most of the traditional industries are in the north so they 're seen as diligent and hard working , where as in people in the south and especially alentejo are stereotyped as being really lazy and taking frequent naps . 
   a lot can be done through diplomacy national defense capability is a very strong component of diplomacy and peace keeping . 
  first and third from the right look gorgeous to me the rest ... 
  it 's not a matter of education or intelligence ; i 've seen more than my fair share of semi-illiterate morons on reddit . 
  it 's all a matter of identity and politics . 
  other than a small amount of subreddits dedicated specifically to right wing politics , reddit as a whole is extremely left leaning pro-american pro-eu anti-russia and anti-china . 
  any opinions opposite to the massively dominant viewpoint will of course find it hard to penetrate here . 
  it 's better to go through a period of negative population growth and slowed/stalled economic growth but maintaining social harmony , cohesion and safety than to replace your native population with illiterate african and middle eastern immigrants and watch your crime rates skyrocket and no-go zones appear . 
  if my country was in a similar situation , i would rather be a japan or hungary than a sweden or germany . 
  reddit thrives on identity politics , and a central part to the predominant identity on reddit is blind hatred of china and spamming anti-china propaganda at any given opportunity . 
  the same goes for reddit 's general attitude towards russia . 
   savings the valuation of your currency has no effect on your local savings , unless by `` savings '' you mean financial products that are tied to currency which is not the case for the vast majority of the population . 
  what can cause devaluation of savings themselves is the inflation that might follow currency devaluation , but so far with the uk 's case we have n't seen extraordinary inflation . 
   purchasing power down purchasing power for imports and when travelling abroad , or if they had debts in foreign currencies . 
   how is that not a bad thing for you as a person trying to make a living ? 
  because currency devaluation also leads to increased exports ( which together with diminished imports will improve the current account ) , boosts domestic demand , and increases domestic employment levels . 
  both valuation and devaluation have their pros and cons to `` the person trying to make a living . '', 
  how do you feel about campaigning when you know you have absolutely no chance of winning ? 
  true britbong banter, 
  no , it means 1.2 % real growth in wages . 
  that 's some impressively bad math . 
  bad math . 
  he subtracted the variations in pay growth and inflation , and not the actual values of annual pay growth or inflation . 
   their currency lost 20 % that 's not necessarily a bad or good thing . 
  http://meedia.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mark-zuckerberg-david-schraven-630x353.jpg looks exactly like the type of guy who would censor information to fit his narrative . 
  i 'd be extremely concerned about giving this type of person any censoring privileges if i was a german . 
   a lot of chinese provinces and minorities are badly treated not just tibet badly treated ? 
  tibet has flourished as a part of china , they have industrialized , built railways roads hospitals and schools , life expectancy has risen from 35 to 68 , child mortality decreased from 43 % to 0.661 % , the tibetan ethnic population has grown from 1.2 million people to nearly 3 million , and the gdp of the tar is 30 times higher than in 1950 . 
  but no , they were surely better off starving under feudal serfdom . 
  for as much as reddit ridicules propaganda from russia and north korea , it 's unbelievable the ammount of anti-china stupidity that is circlejerked all through this website and regularly makes it to the front page . 
  that 's definitely not the case here in portugal , but it 's the case for my girlfriend 's apartment building in the uk . 
  we 're often woken up in the middle of the night because some twat was smoking inside ... 
  because he implied that someone 's immigrant background should have no bearing on citizenship . 
  especially in germany 's case , since they only started transitioning to a jus solis regimen in 2000 . 
  because whether or how someone 's immigration background , lineage and place of birth affects their citizenship is a long standing discussion in law . 
  not really ; since 2000 germany is a jus solis system ( provided certain requirements are met ) , that has a jus sanguinis clause for descendants of german citizens . 
  it 's a mixed system compared to that of somewhere like south korea , albeit less strict in some regards . 
  i think the other guy was simply implying that citizenship does n't convey all the information he wants . 
  jus sanguini vs jus solis is a very reasonable constitutional and legislative debate , and europe 's problems with immigration will surely bring it back to public attention . 
  p o l i t i c a l c a r t o o n s prepare for a summer of endless shitposting, 
  90 % of this entire website is very left leaning , all the major political , news and national subs are very left leaning and actively mod against any anti-immigration or anti-islam posts , and yet it seems so terribly bothered and scared of a tiny shitposting circlejerk sub which is n't even allowed out of its containment circle anyway . 
  this sub is so cheesy and cringy sometimes that you have to wonder if some of these posts are n't just self aware shitposting and trolling . 
  i 'm gon na have to be honest and give the hand to * italy * the greatest piece of eurotrash-eurodance ever written is [ deja vu aka the initial d song ] ( https://youtu.be/dv13gl0a-fa ), 
  to be honest , i 'm quite ok with this . 
  i prefer newspapers to be openly biased and support a candidate . 
  here in portugal no newspaper openly supports any candidate . 
  instead , they 're just filled with columnists and editors who praise their respective party and trash the opposition without ever showing public support and claiming they 're impartial and objective newspapers . 
  for some reason , all european national subs i 've been to left very extremely to the left . 
  i 'm not talking social democracy , i 'm talking borderline radical left . 
  r/portugal has a very active base of communist posters who spam communist propaganda so frequently that i wonder if they 're paid to do it . 
  national subs almost make r/europe look balanced . . 
  european born youth of asian ethnicity that turned to extremist islam as a way to vent their frustrations due to the failures of european society and rampant neoliberalism - paraphrasing a political science researcher on portuguese news .

   i 've never eaten whale or wanted to do so really ? 
  you 're missing out man . 
  i ate whale practically every single day during my stay in iceland ( my diet consisted basically of whale , lamb and skyr ) and man , it 's fucking delicious . 
  edit : oops my bad !, 
  and huh . 
  here i thought that there were just a few irrelevant bad apples coming to europe . 
  irrelevant enough that they can defraud european states out of dozens of millions of euro . 
  go live in china for a while and find out for yourself how much outstanding blatantly false propaganda is repeated ad nauseam in western media . 
  yeah yeah yeah , and the bbc claims to be quality journalism . 
  same shit everywhere . 
  macron is bothered about it because russia 's state propaganda happens to be counterpoint to his . 
  he calls a country 's state media organs of influence and propaganda ? 
  no shit . 
  eeeeeeeh it was a mostly facetious post though . 
  just not a fan of crossovers in general, 
   the plant is currently bmw 's sole global production site for x3 , x4 , x5 , and x6 cross-over suvs only burgers could make such terrible cars, 
  i think most are assembled in mexico , and bmw is planning to open another plant there so you know what that means bmw better start building atvs because those beamers will have to climb the wall, 
  a lone wolf of british nationality and asian origin who was mentally ill and motivated by poverty and social exclusion and in no way islam . 
  can i work at bbc now ? 
  yeah that awful alt right group , blowing up people in the name of an imaginary pedophile . 
  clearly reading is n't your stroing point . 
   all i mean is some mix of culture is a good thing , and isolationism is cultural suicide but plenty of monocultural monoethnic societies have thrived throughout history . 
  japan is one of them . 
  before they were bombed and invaded by the americans they were a huge empire and also a cultural powerhouse so either way your argument that `` isolationism is cultural suicide '' is quite frankly bullshit, 
   isolationism is cultural suicide japan is one of the most ethnically and culturally isolated countries in the world and their culture and arts are thriving , both consumer culture and high art, 
   african ( christian ) , carribean in june 2010 the sunday telegraph , through a freedom of information act request , obtained statistics on accusations of crime broken down by race from the metropolitan police service . 
  [ n 2 ] the figures showed that the majority of males who were accused of violent crimes in 2009 -- 10 were black . 
  of the recorded 18,091 such accusations against males , 54 percent accused of street crimes were black ; for robbery , 59 percent ; and for gun crimes , 67 percent . 
  [ 27 ] robbery , drug use , and gang violence have been associated with black people since the 1960s .

  i do n't know about the netherlands but here the law says you ca n't as it 's legal tender and they 're legally obliged to take it . 
  i do n't see how you can enforce it as the hassle for both sides would be too much but still it 's in the law you ca n't refuse legal tender as means of payment . 
   it 's not deception if they put a sticker on the counter '' we round to the nearest 5 cent . '', 
  on the counter , like here . 
  now that 's just false advertisement , if the price tag says 9.99 $ and they charge you 10 $ then that 's fraud , the tag should either say 9.95 $ of 10 $ , they should never be allowed to say the price is something and then insisting on charging higher than that . 
  it 's just a cent , i know , but it 's a matter of principle . 
   first , you are probably to young to remember the euro introduction and the `` nothing will increase '' speech , and we all saw the results . 
  wrong on both accounts . 
   second , 230 $ is the minimum state pension , that a great many thousands of old people receive , for me having 1 or 2 cent coins is irrelevant for many people it is n't . 
  nobody is paid that low and even for them it will be easier because it 's less money they 'll be cheated out of due to easier math . 
  anyway , you already went from `` again the poorer countries get the short straw '' to `` ok , some very elderly people with other sources of income may end up with a few cents less '' ( as if shopkeepers would ever refuse food or other goods to these people because they 're 0.02 $ short ) . 
   because there are abuses , everyone is a criminal ? 
  there are no poor people in need ? 
  what kind of retarded argument is that ? 
  it 's the same retarded argument as yours , if you ca n't change because some people will lose a few cents then we also ca n't stay because there are also abuses under the current system . 
   finally , nowhere you saw me defending our current taxation , one thing has nothing to do with the other . 
  of course not , you 're only making a greater fuzz out of this than you 'd ever make about a national increase in taxation . 
  at least cut the charade - you do n't give two shits about the welfare of these people , what you want is to criticise the eu . 
   ah yes , because these economists make their calculations based on correct data , is n't it ? 
   i remember how in spain a 100 pesetas coin was so similar to a 1 euro coin . 
  but 1 euro was actually 166 pesetas . 
  so prices in many things went up ... yes , a 66 % because of ... financial memory ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  do you know how exchange rates work ? 
  if it was establish that 1 euro = 166.386 pesetas and the parity was kept then that 's the real value of the peso in euros , it 's not `` hurr durr , the 100 coin was similar to a 1 euro coin so their value must be the same '' . 
   you 're used to pay your coffe with a single coin , and then ... you just give out that other coin . 
  that 's like saying `` oh , i rather pay my coffee with an 1 $ coin because i 'd feel cheated if i bought it with two 0.50 $ coins '' . 
  absolutely retarded . 
   again the poorer countries get the short straw and there will be a general increase in prices o everything if this goes forward . 
  no , we do not and no , prices wo n't increase . 
   it might not sound like much but 1-4 cents in each product you buy on a supermarket adds up after a while and when you have people earning 230 $ / month , everything counts . 
  where are all these people earning less than half our minimum wage ? 
  you 're talking as if half the country is starving and the other half is waiting for the first ones to die so they can eat their flesh and not as if you still had plenty of waste . 
  why do n't you tell the rest of the folks here on r/europe about the people here that come on tv saying their silicone tits were paid by the state , the minorities complaining about the social funds when they have lcds and bmws or when retired people complain about their pensions because nowadays they can hardly afford smokes and liquor ? 
  oh , and if you really cared about purchasing power , you 'd be arguing against the corporate rate of 25 % , the vat ( for pretty much everything ) of 23 % and the personal income tax which on the lowest rate ( under 7000 $ / year ) is of 18 % as these are the ones that do kick up the cost of living - not an hypothetical end of the 0.01 $ and the 0.02 $ coins and the eventual rounding of prices for things that now cost 4.98 $ and would then cost 5 $ as that is an absolute joke . 
   greece is upgraded and the uk is downgraded . 
  times are changing . 
  they say greece is b - and the uk is aa + . 
  anyway , it 's the rating agencies , even they have already said their ratings are just `` an opinion '' . 
   it 's pretty simple really , we expand the eu and the eurozone to include the rest of the world . 
  we give brussels full power over the police ( there would n't need to be an army once there is only one nation on earth ) . 
  then we get the geniuses in brussels to calculate the supply and demand of all goods on earth . 
  nothing could possibly go wrong . 
  this is what ukip geniuses are arguing against . 
   and zen we subjugate ze aliens by forcing austerity on them . 
  way better than uploading a virus onto ze mothership . 
  will never know what hit him !, 
  is this meant to be funny ? 
  that 's a quite odd sense of humour . 
  he has a boat and he 's still lonely ? 
  ouch !, 
   yes , and lower saxony could have a monarch once more , and join the commonwealth . 
  william iv - never forget . 
   before argentina invaded there were negotiations taking place to give the islands to them . 
  we also offered a 50/50 split on any oil discovered around the islands ; argentina refused in favour of having 100 % of the oil . 
  once they invaded , public opinion polarised for obvious reasons however . 
  damn , is that true ? 
  they could have achieved so much more through diplomacy !, 
   inheritance tax does n't work . 
  it 's trivial to put the money in trust or move it abroad . 
  and it would promote frivolous spending as opposed to long term investments . 
   normandy seems to make less money than crusader kings ii would have me believe . 
  it did , back in the day . 
  since then pretty much everything shifted to paris . 
   and sudetenland to germany and austria . 
  that sounds treasonous . 
   as a eu3 player this gives me the chills . 
  as an eu3 player , [ austria can give me the chills ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5bfevmk.jpg ) . 
   turkey is not europe . 
  only the tip . 
   well , i for one would blame the drug dealer more than the addict . 
  that 's nonsense , that 's like blaming the car company because you ran over someone while speeding . 
  brasil [ hue ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jdjxjsenig ), 
   are you being sarcastic ? 
  no , i 'm not , they do n't look arabic at all , heck , the small ones have a cross on them and all :p, 
   what do you mean `` storm of the mediterranean countries coming '' ? 
  i think he meant the odd exchange rates like the 1936.27 italian lire for 1 euro . 
  we kinda had it easy with 200.482 escudos for 1 euro , basically it was 1 conto for 5 euros . 
   they look like they have arabic symbols or design . 
  [ they do n't look like that at all ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6uwjgzz.jpg ) . 
   i never argued for this . 
  you either support cutting public spending or you do n't . 
  there 's no middle ground , there 's no `` i 'm against austerity but i 'm also against continuing public spending '' . 
   the empirical data mostly agrees with him on this by the way . 
  that taxes do n't cause unemployment ? 
  nope , they do . 
   depending on the level of taxes and how they are spent of course . 
  sure , you could levy taxes and use them to create full employment , you could pay all the unemployed to open up ditches and fill them back up or to paint all the walls yellow or draft them into the military or whatever - though society would be much worse off than it would without the taxes that went to pay for this nonsense . 
   yeah , the empirical data for austerity all over europe sure shows it 's working . 
  naurgul made the claim that taxes do n't cause unemployment , there was nothing with regards to austerity . 
  austerity is about cutting down public spending , not cutting down unemployment . 
  if austerity is n't working because we 're not getting any better , then the alternative is to not cut public spending and do what got us in this situation in the first place - you know this , so please stop rationalising against austerity and stop assuming we could ever continue on the path we were . 
    the young person , having no experience , rejects empiricism . 
  stopped reading here . 
  you are the ones rejecting empirical data . 
   money taxed can go into employing people . 
  to do redundant jobs such as those in the public sector . 
   on the other hand , money that is left untaxed does not need to go into employing people at all ; it can go into bonds , bank accounts or investments in nonsensical financial instruments . 
  what are bonds if not investments on real life productive activities ? 
  what about bank accounts , do n't people store value on it and eventually use it to either invest or consume and create employment like that ?

  we ca n't save anything , we do n't do anything out of ordinary . 
  i 'd kill myself if i earned that little , with the money i earn i already feel utterly depressed i have to count my pennies . 
  500 euros in portugal you survive ? 
  maybe if you do n't pay rent . 
  a small 50 square meters costs 400 euros . . 
  i know because i was just looking for apartments . 
  would still be awesome for portugal , i 'm in the middle of negotiating a online marketing salary and 1100 would dictate i could go back home, 
  and this stupid xenophobic place ate it right up . 
  i wish there was a proper alternative . 
  course we do . 
  on with the joseph bitlers and dolph stallings of the world . 
  fucking exaggeration and likely has never set foot on portuguese soil . 
  they ask if you want something , you say no and they move the fuck on . 
  i have met * thousands * of foreigners in lisbon and not one got so worked up around it they 'd * never come back * . 
  mostly people just scuffle and comment on it , and move on and i 'd say over 70 % of them did n't even encounter any dealers . 
  what happened when portugal decriminalised drugs ? 
  reddit posted about the fact we decriminalised drugs for the 500th time . 
  * rambles about beaches , snails and french people . 
   / u/dclauzel will likely have his fingers in his ears going `` la la la '' when religions and ethnic violence becomes the norm on european streets fuck all the racism , the bigotry , but worse of all the fear mongering is the worst part about this increasingly shitty sub . 
  200 something euros in portugal ? 
  hahahaha . 
  that 's how much a friend of mine pays for a poorly furnished room in a flat shared with 10 other people . 
  as i recall , there are plenty of customers for the a380 in the arabs . 
  they canceled a lot of 350s for the a380 . 
  but that 's where it 'll go , nowhere else . 
  concept of a 4 engine jumbojet is like you said very well outdated , the two engine new gen crafts are just so fuel efficient . 
  the a380 was a bet for the chinese and indian markets and it might still make its splash , i mean it 's better to load a plane with more people and take less time slots but how efficient will it be vs a neo ? 
  makes me sad to see airbus shit the bed like this , always been my dream of flying one . 
  the 330s are simply put my favorite craft to fly in and from pilots i 've heard they handle like a beaut . 
  thanks for the time you took to put that post together i have been out of the loop for a bit ever since i quit pursuing a career in aviation , hurts too much to reopen the wound . 
  mediterranean culture is put simply portugal , spain , italy , france , greece . 
  could maybe consider croatia and co but to be honest i have n't been . 
  it 's not just the food that 's a give away ( olive oil . 
  olive fucking oil on everything ) but the way of life . 
  mediterraneans like to have long lunches , the ` lazy ' cultural part of naps and of course family , the olive trees , the vineyards , the fishing . 
  that is quintessentially mediterranean and macedonia , kosovo , serbia et co might share similar values but they are n't mediterranean . 
  it 's the climate , the sun , the gardens and the products that define countries as mediterranean as well as christianity . 
  closer to a mediterranean culture than any of the balkans you listed are the romanian although as close as croatia i 'd wager . 
  i wo n't bite however since i 've never been to croatia and ca n't judge myself . 
  what a terrible article and post . 
  the a380 a bad bet , that 's a new one . 
  i 'll bite - why do you think so ? 
  uhhhhh ... that could n't be further from reality . 
  i have n't had the chance yet to do so , although i 'd go in a heartbeat if i could , but my girlfriend who 's romanian lived in spain for 10 years and she did n't know spanish people celebrated name days . 
  in contrast with romania , where everyone has like 2 or 3 birthdays each year because a name day is pretty much a smaller birthday . 
  i was wrong huh , in portugal however i 've never heard of this . 
  facilidades de te mandarem passear ( no privado ! ), 
  we do n't either in portugal or spain , i 'm surprised the french do it . 
  it 's also way easier to get hired , to know your government has a safety net for you , that you 're not ruined and you can take the chance to trim some fat , not worry about living expenses and go back to school . 
  none of which is possible in portugal . 
  i very much doubt it 's easier , anyway . 
  i was doing a part time a few years ago with pt , a big telecom with millions in profit , and one day on my way to work i got a call saying we were all let go and to not bother coming . 
  we got paid a week extra and whatever we worked and bye bye . 
   spain 's unemployment is lowering and will get better . 
  however , the only reason is because they made it really easy to fire people , pay low wages , etc ding ding , exactly what 's happening in portugal and why i did a 180 and am working in romania . 
  seriously , i love the iberian peninsula and i want to go back . 
  but you as romanian working in it should really look into coming back to romania , wages are bigger and you get better benefits . 
   internet penetration ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  so you 're telling me that music videoclip of the british looking dude sitting in his chair in vr , imagining he 's in the caribbeans or something fucking hot chicks , is based on true facts ? 
  they just hop around in gangs , often with one less limb than normal , and they 're dangerous to pets not just because they attack but they carry a lot of diseases ( such as heartworm , and there 's a lot of mosquitoes here ) . 
  they are very difficult to rehabilitate and rehome . 
  the best to do , no matter how sad it is ... is really to enforce kill shelters . 
  but ... romania is n't slav ... 
  are you seriously suggesting a romanian does n't know what russian invaders are ? 
  the country that got fucked of billions in gold and resources by the russians , installed a doctrine that fucked them in the ass for decades and killed/raped thousands of their people ? 
  boy , fucking propaganda warriors from ukraine are among the worst thing i have seen on the internet . 
  i fucking detest russia as well as a country but i do n't detest their people . 
  by this point , i symphatize more with fucking russia than ukraine simply because i am more than sick of ukranian bullshit . 
  i did online marketing and i 've recognized shit ton of social media manipulation but never as much as i have seen from ukranian ` front lines combatants ' like i see here on this sub . 
  yes , your country is at war . 
  yes , the russians are behind it . 
  however it 's your people rebelling against you as well , do n't think for a second it 's only russian boots on your territory . 
  those are your people you fucked in the ass and neglected enough that they sided with * russians * . 
  if you have anyone to blame , blame your corrupt politicians above any squatting slav . 
  if anyone at all got a proposal from russia in the 21st century and thought jee , that 's a good idea to ally with them then you have absolutely no fucking qualms or claims justifiable enough rather than fix up your own damn mess and clear the channels of any of this piggish propaganda for channels that have the power to act on and help you out of this mess . 
  get your ass out there , write to the un and european deputies , vote for closer eu and nato ties , and defend your country with brains if you do n't have the boots to put on the ground . 
  yes , german has obviously more speakers than polish or russian who cover literally one half of the globe and an italian person , a romance language speaker , will most likely understand it . 
  it was n't spanish or romanian they tried to speak . 
  it was a whole different branch of languages . 
  i 'd love to see similar for portugal , there 's tales to be told about our german and english tourists . 
  on a sidenote , i once met a croatian girl who slept on the opposite room of my girlfriend 's . 
  she was super cool about all the sex and noise , and gave me rakia or something of the name . 
  thanks tina !, 
  i mean ... those are pretty uncommon languages apart english . 
  ohhh boy , ca n't wait for the red pill repost of this . 
  funnier is , you mentioned bucharest . 
  while i do like it here , i owe romania no allegiance and they are a pretty fucked up country as well - even though i consider it my 2nd country . 
  you 're literally so stupid you got the cities and countries mixed up . 
  and you know what ? 
  for central european climate and city living , i would gladly stay in bucharest . 
  continental cities are boring as shit , but at least the romanians know how to integrate and innovate . 
  i 'm really shocked that comment is still standing and that user is not banned . 
  i wish i could say if he does n't go , i go but it 's too late for that and my occasional once a week visit is going to be once a year . 
  your response is just adorably laughable , it 's as if a child is trying to act like an adult . 
  for the sake of your upcoming economical turmoil in austria , i hope no one else acts like you . 
  i just might , can i have a picture of your grandma ? 
  just leave it , reserve logic for real economists and strategists . 
  people here lean on inflated , meaningless stats like it 's gospel . 
  oh , but austria speaks 70 % english compared to 30 % 100true % in romania . 
  if the holocaust and ww2 is n't austria 's fault then how are lost generations from communism and the ceausescu breeding policy that sent thousands , millions affected as by following generations , to orphanages without the most basic education romania 's fault ?

  but then again , economy is not a science but rather a school of thought pitching mathematics and psychology . 
  all we need is to take a big step back and read into the variables . 
  resources are dwindling , there are new players on the board and the economical and fiduciary model are deeply flawed , nearing debt 's event horizon . 
  the planet wo n't survive if europe does n't take the hit and leads into a new age . 
  whatever literature comes up , germans and germany wo n't budge in their ideas . 
  and although it may seem catastrophic in the short-term , it will be good for all of us in the mid and long run . 
  europe should n't keep on catering money for speculators and a greed ridden wall street . 
  let the euro-titanic ( quoting loony farage here ) sink . 
  i give a few months until the dollar goes under and then ( only then ) actual change is produced across the globe . 
  hopefully with no belligerence . 
  then , a new economy may form with balanced and diverse currencies , with no unfair hegemonies and more fitting to a globalized market . 
  bring it on . 
  the more this drags on , the worse it gets for the people . 
  let all the bastards come out as the free market hyenas they are , only interested in fat payouts . 
  the more this becomes obvious the more people see the need for a change . 
  actual civilizational change and not obama-like petty change . 
  the eu is dead . 
  long live the eu !, 
  the best way to help roma people is to imprison and take out these gangs . 
  but germany is ok with themselves dictating eu policies and holding everyone else hostage . 
  this thread reeks of negative karma . 
  there 's like , a thousand downvotes in here . 
  we 're at peak everything !, 
  peak debt , peak energy , peak food , peak fish stocks , peak antibiotics , peak population , peak water and specially peak debt !, 
  oh , we 're right there at the event horizon of debt , getting ready to be sucked into the black hole . 
  this ponzi is ready to collapse . 
  the planet is of finite carrying support and yet people breed more people while demanding their middle class status attached to an unsustainable eco footprint . 
  i think we 're all going to hell in a slow grind that 'll last decades !, 
  violent , no holds barred , decades of war , famine and pestilence . 
  we 'll bounce back eventually . 
  merkel is just a catalyst . 
  in fact , she 's right about austerity , except it should be applied on a much broader scope , with profound social change and addressing the ecological sustainability of it all . 
  the eu is dead . 
  long live the eu !, 
  yes and no . 
  money is safer invested in things that value alongside inflation . 
  things like property or precious metals . 
  but that was in the old days and may now only be temporary , given the sudden unpredictable paradigm and even market irrationality . 
  besides , the eu is reluctant to do a american sized [ qe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quantitative_easing ) so nobody really knows how it will play out . 
  the best thing to do is to invest in land and self-sufficiency ( producing ) . 
  it has always been so . 
  it 's also not a good idea to be in debt if shtf , as things can spiral out of ones control although it can also allow loans to be paid in just months ( think germany in the 30s ) . 
  there are many variables in the system and it can lead to hyperinflation or deflation scenario along with the fiddling of interest rates . 
  what is out of our control is the large hedge funds gaming the system and betting on certain outcomes . 
  wherever they go , the market follows and prophecies fulfill . 
  it 's a bit like having and elephant loose on a lifeboat . 
  the derivatives market is literally a massive black hole of money waiting to swallow the world and reset the economy . 
  cyber-warfare will make disputes more even across the globe . 
  size wo n't matter as much . 
  that is , until someone uses it as an excuse to march in the big guns . 
  on this field , even mighty china or germany can be broken by a smaller group . 
  nevertheless , it will bring chaos everywhere . 
  markets , power grids , access to information , etc. 
  all we can do now is wait for the first government sanctioned all-out assault . 
  portugal : the first and last of the global empires . 
  this will be an interesting experiment . 
  one that will dictate the future of capitalism and the status-quo . 
  in fact , it will be so important that i doubt the current powers-that-be will even allow it to succeed . 
  white is a cultural tag with nothing but discriminating implications . 
  but if you were to ask a geneticist to analyse your genes or just phenotypes , he 'd probably say you 're one of many shades of white and that pure white does n't even exist . 
  dumkbid , pls, 
   some would even argue . . did you notice the `` some '' ? 
  extreme times will create extreme resonings . 
  everyone foresees this . 
  my point is , germany is ( once again ? ), 
  a puppet for german elites . 
  they 'll destroy this peaceful union if it gives them quick cash . 
  power corrupts and big money legislates . 
  i 've learned this in my lazy unter-something portuguese education . 
  so , get yourself out of germany and see what is happening in the rest of europe . 
  what do you think is waiting for us down this austerity road ? 
  germany could save the eurozone by choosing a different political leadership . 
  one not so protective of their own private sectors . 
  their private sectors , like most , only seeks immediate interests and profit . 
  they 'll likely kill their golden goose if it means large immediate profits and self-destruction in the mid and long run . 
  like it or not , they are the engine of europe . 
  they 're also the most populous country . 
  sadly , this is a calendar problem and elections are still far away . 
  atleast , there should a decision on the euro matter and not this standoff that only benefits the current status quo - german banks and industry . 
  my history ? 
  are you talking about me or my country 's ? 
  oh , this is gon na be rich . 
  i fail to see any valid argument in your reply . 
  it is , however , filled with upvotes . 
  long live the majority dictatorship . 
  really , is the alternative that much worse ? 
  50 years from now , history could be read like this . 
  germany initiated two world wars and lost . 
  then , they worked very hard indeed to get out of the hole they put all of europe in . 
  they suckled on the marshall plan and regained economic superpower status . 
  it then reabsorbed it 's long due eastern half . 
  meanwhile , germany had sold and loaned to many european countries , making them german-dependent . 
  it was sort of a union but not . 
  as germany was exempt from any rules . 
  then , the debt horizon neared on this ill-united europe . 
  in this economically irrational world , smaller and weaker countries were unable to keep up with the interest rates due to natural growth limits and severe economical hampering from a botched currency - the euro , and many years failed euro policies and puppet institutions . 
  policies dictated by germany . 
  nations future prospects became bleak and so , their interest rates were raised . 
  germany , as a core lender , profited from this . 
  it had no interest in stopping the deadly feedback loop of recessive policies that could never lead to growth or employment or progress .

  europe has completely capitulated in regards to the whole refugee crisis . 
  we 're in a position of complete weakness in regards to the turkey deal in which seemingly erdogan has the upper hand . 
  europe has failed at maintaining its external borders and this has seriously effected the european project . 
  wake up to yourselves brussels , get some long-term strategies into place to secure our borders and let 's get some fucking stability in the region . 
  i 've already got the canh\u00f5es in mon\u00e7\u00e3o locked and loaded . 
  in fairness , being from the north in portugal , i 've actually at times felt a greater affinity with people from galiza rather than those from madeira and algarve . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , we should never have been separated . 
  do n't forget the drop bears . 
  those motherfuckers go straight for the jugular . 
  germany gib funds plox . 
  as long as the only turk who comes in and does the breeding is saltbae , maybe i can turn a blind eye . 
  i think i have my chainmail and vial of holy water hanging around somewhere . 
  i would like to see turkey actively shoot down a greek jet or boat that has n't entered its territorial waters . 
  we close borders and do n't allow any alien vessels to enter eu territory/water . 
  no exceptions . 
  i wonder if an ngo can pick me up from paros and take me to mykonos in the summer . 
  it seems that do a stellar job as a ferry service, 
  how fucking hard is it to shut the border with turkey . 
  no one comes in without approval , man the borders ... there 's plenty of greeks i 'm sure looking for good work . 
  make trumps fence look like a puppy . 
  the eu is a supranational powerhouse , countries like turkey should quiver when they make threats to the eu we should just bend over every time erdocunt comes calling, 
  you want a bunch of jannisaries arriving at the gates of rotterdam on goatback ? 
  because that 's how you get a bunch of jannisaries arriving at the gates of rotterdam on goatback . 
  the mountain germans have been getting rather uppity in this thread ( had to have a dig ) . 
  monte negro also means black mountain in portuguese as well !, 
  hang on . 
  so they throw stones at policemen but because they will leave the scene frustrated the cops should appease them ? 
  they should reprehended and punished to the full extent of swedish law . 
  it 's a shame that swedish police were n't able to gather and coordinate in a way that led to arrests . 
  police should never be intimidated or inhibited from entered an area where crimes are being committed . 
  i would really like to see the tail between these punk 's legs with 100 swedish policemen/women bearing down on them . 
  treaty of trianon , never forget . 
  listen here putamadre , we would embrace a federation with the spaniards as long as they bring the jam\u00f3n , fine women and we bring the fado . 
  came for the balkan shit show . 
  must say i 'm disappointed so far . 
  edit : i love being wrong . 
  yep , no arguments there and that 's important . 
  but russia 's overarching military machine from ground to air to sea would pummel both germany and france . 
  the only military force that can stop russia is solely the us or one big motherfucken euro coalition * boner intensifies *, 
  germany is strong enough to take on russia in a war ? 
  til . 
  our pm should fly over to camps in greece and ask them personally if they want to come to portugal ... should work out well, 
  georgians & armenians are fine as long as they stop leaving my car on bricks . 
  the map shows the fantastic effect austerity measures have on economies . 
  long live the southern debt belt . 
  they collected some taxes but did not interbred or convert anyone/hardly anyone in the galiza/minho area . 
  there is absolutely no trace of moorish culture in the norte , ca n't say the same for lisbon or algarve i also forgot to mention asturias in my initial post as being part of the `` badass coalition '' to drive the moors out of the peninsula . 
  norte crl . 
  speak for yourselves ... north portugal here , we never got taken over by the moors . 
  we 're the iberian master race . 
  you can thank us and the leonese for liberating your sorry north african asses, 
  and emperor orban of course . 
  place those people who have illegally entered the country in detention facility . 
  place a massive disincentive to complete the journey `` if you enter illegally you will not be granted asylum '' . 
  why would a moroccan make the trip to europe knowing there 's legislation in place meaning he will never freely set foot in europe ? 
  there must be a clear disincentive to illegally travel to europe . 
  i would rather the power be in europe 's control rather than in the hands of 3rd parties ( turkey etc. ) . 
  if this means ceding power of external borders to a full funded , efficient european union backed border control i would be all for it . 
  at the end of the day , i personally , have the best interests of a united europe at heart and not the interests of illegal migrants . 
  i think this project is too great of a thing to risk . 
  yes that might sound harsh , but we have to think of the long term viability of the project ... right now , all this illegal immigration from na etc. 
  is really putting it to the test . 
  greece closes its land border with turkey as does bulgaria . 
  do n't have documents or a valid passport , that 's fine back you go . 
  want asylum , please utilise the existing protocols in place not march through 10 european countries . 
  all vessels attempting to enter european territorial waters are turned back immediately . 
  vessels that are n't sea worthy are replaced so that it can withstand the trip back : when you compare the size of european navies and resources compared to australia 's , it should be perfectly possible to achieve . 
  of course i 'm oversimplifying the matter , but all it needs is the political will the resources are not an issue . 
  what the actual fuck . 
  why are you making a mountain out of a mole hill ? 
  he is totally right in saying that it implies kinship and not ownership . 
  he should not feel ashamed in saying `` our german women '' just like a women should not feel ashamed saying `` our german men '' you should not be ashamed to share a bond with your common people and talking about your fellow countrymen and women with words that carry feeling and sentiment . 
  who are you bro ? 
  exactly this , your military is quite powerful . 
  if it 's not boots on the ground there are other ways to neutralise such targets considering your proximity . 
  ca n't just keep twiddling your thumbs when innocent turks are dying . 
  fair enough , now that i take a step back , it does look more and more islamist !, 
  make badajoz great again !, 
  i fear for any country where the leader is no longer held accountable for his actions , that country is destined for trouble ahead . 
  the people need to stand up and reclaim what 's theirs . 
  portugal stronk . 
  seriously though , as a nortenho , it shits me that galiza and the north has been separated by a bullshit arbitrary line . 
  i would be down for a reunification 100 % . 
  same people and we 'd have the same language were it not for 1000 years or separation, 
  god help you if any oil reserves are found in romania . 
  i understand your sentiment , and obviously the people themselves are far from being at fault , this is the absolute truth and perhaps op 's use of the word degenerate was too far . 
  i think my comment 's intention was to highlight the country of turkey 's decline irregardless of the people of turkey ( some great people might i add ) . 
  but one thing we ca n't shy away from is the clear divide that only seems to be widening between the west and turkey . 
  we could compare portugal and turkey but we would be wasting bandwidth with hypotheticals . 
  turkey has no place even at the negotiating table with its current status . 
  it 's an unfortunate outcome from erdogan 's policies and his anti progressive policies . 
  so what is your solution ? 
  should we appease erdogan because less than 50 % of the country did n't vote for him ? 
  this kind of thought process will lead to effectively nothing in the world ever being done . 
  he represents turkey . 
  he broke the `` do n't be a dick '' rule and unfortunately for turkey , this should close the book on any kind of accession talks ( if they were n't already dead . ), 
  i think we 've found the guy that polishes putins shaft on the regular . 
  universities are places that breed ideas and often intellectuals speak and converse about more than just their designated fields . 
  what you 're experiencing in australia is the freedom of thought and discussion across multiple issues which undoubtedly is how you make societies better . 
  i never understand people who do n't like where they are but refuse to go back to the motherland !,

  it 's common knowledge who it was that demanded so much austerity . 
  agreed , from what i can see it 's just a shitty forum that has barely over 1k users , i do n't see why an open letter from them would be considered news unless the silly season turned full retard season . 
  orly ? 
  the funny thing is that the imf , usually seen as the most hawkish institution in the world , right from the start did n't want to apply measures as harsh , but the other 2 members of the troika , you know - your supposed european friends - demanded them out of some sick ideology instead of good economic sense . 
  europe is run by ideologues or , in another word we sometimes use in my country with the meaning of `` someone with a lot of stupid ideas '' - idiots . 
  edit : english, 
  the link does n't work for me , but he 's right , so do n't downvote . 
  the reason is that ` eu ' reads like ` you ' and that 's one of the exceptions where words started with vowels use ` a ' instead of ` an ' . 
  thanks for clarifying . 
  still , newspapers can pick their columnists so clearly there 's a relatively large segment of swedes who like to read this shit . 
  kinda depressing . 
  agreed - this is quite ridiculous - is this some kind of swedish tabloid or something ? 
  people in geneve get ready to visit france to fill your gas tanks while you shop cheaply in carrefour . 
  almost , our constitution only allows extraditing portuguese citizens for crimes of terrorism or international organized crime . 
  so this case could sort of fit the exception . 
  however , no matter what any deal we have with a country or the constitutional exception say , for a portuguese citizen it 's always possible , by law , for a court to deny the extradition . 
  in this case , it happened twice hence why it reached the supreme court and now it is legally impossible . 
  even if the courts had not decided it , the portuguese republic reserved the right to refuse any extradition in all the deals it made with other countries in the case of a portuguese citizen . 
  so it could still be simply refused without breaking any international treaties ( although that would be unlikely ) . 
  the us is [ still after him ] ( http://downloadsexpresso.aeiou.pt/expressoonline/pdf/cartageorgewright130712.pdf ) , even after our supreme court refused it , there 's no way he can now be legally extradited and they simply ignore our laws and keep asking for it . 
  do note , that he is arrested , portugal is just insisting that he will serve his punishment here because he is now a portuguese citizen . 
  the us is not in the right here . 
  any hiccups ? 
  this pretty much needs to be done if we do n't want the very near future collapse of the euro and a depression of horrible magnitude on our backs , the private sector is deleveraging and will be doing so for some time , the money needs to come from somewhere and it 's time to let the central bank do it 's job as lender of last resort and as the ultimate backstop of all our debt . 
  those are probably the 2 politicians i hate the most so i upvoted you , but i think we were going for funny stuff in this thread so here 's a full hour video of , another politician i hate very much , [ jos\u00e9 socrates speaking horrible english ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl-90zypyaa ) ( warning painful to watch ) . 
   after that , we also vote for people who does necessary , but uncomfortable reforms , like our pension reform , for example . 
  when did southern europe do that ? 
  err not long ago . 
  portugal did exactly that in the last elections . 
  our current majority government was elected after promising that they would do all the reforms agreed with the troika and would do any and all reforms needed to reach our deficit targets if the ones agreed with the troika were not enough . 
  of course that if after all this effort people do n't start to see things improving , and they are n't because every time things start to improve some other country in europe goes into problems and drags us down again , it 's going to be hard to keep the reforming impetus . 
  i 'm not sure how we in portugal can use the model of `` huge ass chunk of land per capita rich in natural resources '' . 
  not true , portugal did a lot of reforms before the euro , namely to actually get in the euro . 
  europe could easily pressure the countries to keep reforming while easing at the same time . 
  agreed , i keep reminding people that , at the time , we also thought it would be all right to let lehman fall . 
  i like how you keep calling us pigs and how we have shitty printing money habits . 
  it must be good to be speaking from a country whose economy is not fucked up precisely because you guys do quantitative easing and print money by the hundreds of billions . 
  this is not really related to our argument ... 
  i guess i just needed to vent . 
  are n't we already in that last resort stage ? 
  i actually think we are . 
  we can keep forcing the reforms that actually solve the problem but if we do n't concurrently print money i do n't see how the eurozone will survive . 
  they 're doing what they should 've been doing since the beginning of the crisis - printing money - seems like a good idea to help solve the problem imho . 
  they may be idiots ( i certainly did not vote for socrates ) , but when people are lied to , particularly by someone with a credible appearance , they often make poor choices . 
  i choose to mostly blame the liars who should at least be in jail ( shooting them may be taking it too far ) as i do n't see how democracy can work with either an idiot or mensa population when politicians are allowed to freely lie . 
  not in power , but sadly still alive and having fun , enjoying the money he got trough [ corruption ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jos%c3%a9_s%c3%b3crates#controversies ) , in paris . 
  i 'd certainly like to ask that pos why he said my country needed serious reforms when he ran for prime minister and then not only did he not do most of them , he left after only 2 years and due in no small part to those actions ( him just leaving midterm for his new european jerb ) we were shortly after being ruled by the opposition 's leader jos\u00e9 socrates who quickly got us into as much debt as all the prime ministers before him since 1974 ( look at [ 2005-2010 ] ( http://aventadores.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/image9.png ) ) . 
  so yeah , i guess i 'd like to ask him to go fuck himself in the ass . 
   nope , this acronym has been used since the mid-90s and i 've been using it for years before the euro crisis , why would i stop using it now ? 
  whatever , if you do n't see how this acronym is harmful , you are an ignorant and lacking in empathy . 
  if you do n't see how this helps the extremely easy progression between thinking that economic superiority means moral superiority , cultural superiority and eventually genetic superiority you 're a fool and you refuse to see what 's happening around you . 
  by all means keep using it . 
   also , there is virtually nothing to be stimulated . 
  many industries have a shortage of workers . 
  maybe you can `` stimulate '' higher wages then ... 
  for starters , i 'd prefer if you would stop using that offensive acronym . 
  to answer your question , i do n't think portugal or the other troubled countries should do stimulus . 
  i think the non troubled ones , particularly those with very low interest rates , should . 
  we 'd just rise with the tide and recover our competitiveness much quicker . 
  it certainly would . 
  although , not necessarily the right thing to do while they are in the eu , as france alone not doing austerity will not be enough to solve the problem and the german amongst others insist on relative austerity even now . 
  btw i 'd like to know how you can grasp an attitude from a few written words so well . 
  i do n't know about the bailouts but when it comes to hollande i think this proves that the stimulus package was exactly the right thing to do . 
  apparently , even a small stimulus like the one holland did was enough to keep french economy from going into a recession . 
  you think the french ratings and yields would not , very soon , go the way of italy otherwise ? 
  well a country trade surplus is another 's deficit . 
  before the euro the other eurozone members could manipulate currency to compensate . 
  right now they can not , so it does seem to create a problem . 
  tell me about it , this was so unfair , i totally deserved this prize . 
  not just policy makers , all europeans should be reading these too . 
  policy makers are quite constrained by what the ignorant european populace they depend on for votes wants . 
  i was going to call you a `` german nazi '' , but something about that did n't sound right . 
  thanks to eu rules , withdrawing euros from a cash machine costs you the same anywhere in the eu as it does in your own country from a cash machine that does not belong to your bank . 
  luckily , in * my country * that cost is - free of charge - so i pay no fees for withdrawing anywhere in the eu muahahahah . 
  this article is based on a paper they link to many times you can read it [ here ] ( http://www.feasta.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/trade-off1.pdf ) if you want to make a more informed decision . 
  one should not call shenanigans light heartedly , it 's serious business . 
  their situations are quite different in my opinion . 
  the world economy is in a lot worse shape than it was when argentina collapsed , argentina was pegged to the dollar but it still had its own currency , argentina 's main trading partners were not in a crisis , argentina is rich in natural resources which rose in value since it collapsed , etc. 
  the world economy is so fragile that even lehman brothers collapsing was enough to totally fuck it up so i 'm quite worried with what could happen if a country like greece did the same . 
  greece is already fine for august , because the ecb authorized the bank of greece to lend that money , september is where the can is now . 
  eh that brings back memories of my trusty [ us robotics 28.8 k ] ( http://www.recycledgoods.com/zoom.aspx?productid=21098 ) modem which was the envy of most of the people at the time that still had shitty 14.4 k modems . 
  that thing was fast !, 
  i liked it so much i totally ignored the 33.6 modems that started appearing a bit later and only upgraded when the 56k ones finally appeared . 
  ahh those were the days . 
  i remember my internet connection going down because someone used the phone on my house . 
  there was no reddit , you had to rely on a bunch of websites you kept in what we used to call favorites , nowadays it 's a rare occasion when people use favorites because it 's so easy to find anything you 've seen before on google anyway . 
  the more computer knowledgeable of us also used what was known as rss readers to get links and stories much as you do now on reddit , but those were n't filtered by the community , it was hard to know what was worthy of your attention or not . 
  back then , many websites had editorial control of what was posted instead of the modern crowsourcing we use now with everyone upvoting and downvoting content . 
  we had to organize our emails in many folders and subfolders , because it was so hard to search your emails and you could not tag them . 
  even this folder organization working well depended on the eldritch imap protocol and you would lose it if you used pop . 
  i 'd say the grass was greener then , but it was n't . 
  i agree , it is hardly surprising ; your stated reason however , has nothing to do with it . 
  modern zoos are nothing like that , the proof is easily seen by the success many are having in breeding endangered species in captivity . 
  many of those species , are very hard to breed in captivity and the only way you can do so is if you provide an environment where the animals are actually happy . 
  here 's an [ example ] ( http://www.lisboainside.net/en/noticias/119-zoo-de-lisboa-com-familia-aumentada ) for you . 
  it 's ok , i give you my blessing . 
   redditor for 6 years, 
  yes , but i wanted to see how that has evolved over the years since the crisis started and more and more greek debt was shifted to among others the ecb and imf . 
   portugal lives its most glorious days . 
  i can confirm this , as a lot more males emigrate than females , things are getting more glorious every day .

work for portugal ? 
  sorry what ? 
  what , in the past 6 years , has actually improved in portugal ? 
  debt has never been higher , unemployment only remains at the current levels because of number manipulation/temporary positions/emigration ( and even the official figure is heartbreaking ) , taxes are at an all time high , medium wages allow for no savings at all ( lower wages are simply another form of servitude , btw ) and the economy ca n't create enough stable jobs to prop the country up . 
  not that portugal 's policy was any better before the troika , but all the troika did was what i feared . 
  i took care of the creditors ( aka big international banks ) and despite all the talk about reforming , did nothing but impose blind ad-hoc measures meant only to guarantee that they got their money . 
  hell , under their supervision , portugal 's biggest private bank manage to hide a gigantic fraud , despite passing all of ecb 's so-called `` stress tests '' . 
  and let 's not forget how happy they all were about gaspar , our former finance minister ( ex-sachs ) that after resigning his position stated that the policy implemented by the portuguese government and the troika had failed . 
  guess after he said that he stopped being such an authority in fiscal matters . 
  carry on , they say . 
  all this talk about the division of europe and these stereotypes about the nations that compose it are worrying me to a point where i seriously start considering whether we trully share the same values , or simply like to believe that so that we do n't go back to slitting each others ' throats over a piece of dirt . 
  technically , our first king ( d. afonso henriques ) was n't happy with just seceding from galicia . 
  he initially went on to wage offensive war on his former liege but failed , and then turned his attention south . 
  other than that , you are absolutely correct . 
  it 's just that in modern times spain is no longer a term used to define the peninsula geographically ( since it 's been claimed by castille ) and naturally the portuguese dislike being called `` spanish '' . 
  instead , people should use the term iberian , since that 's the geographic definition of the peninsula ( iberian peninsula ) and has no political connotation . 
  it may have changed by now , but in the 80s/early 90s , i learned very little about the 20th century at school . 
  it almost went from the assassination of king d. carlos , the first republic , salazar 's rise to power , and straight to 1974 , as if the times of the estado novo were some sort of taboo . 
  other than that i agree that we cover plenty of our worse deeds , and probably do n't give enough emphasis to some of the high points of our history ( such as being among the first nations to abolish the death penalty ) . 
  we do tend to polish our military deeds versus castille a bit , even if we have some credit to do it . 
  it 's not easy being the underdog of the region for 800 years . 
  this . 
  it 's probably what i hate most about our culture . 
  people have no respect for whoever 's on time and waiting for them , and in social events , everyone seems to think `` fashionably late '' means arriving 1h past the appointed time . 
  every single time . 
  i often get told by foreign clients how very unportuguese of me it is to insist on arriving at meetings 5min before the scheduled time . 
  i 'm afraid you are mistaken . 
  [ celtiberians ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/celtiberians ) celtic culture is one ingredient out of many that help compose galician culture , aswell as northern portugal 's . 
  music elements like bagpipes are still played today in the northwest of the peninsula . 
  plus , if you 'd like to learn something interesting about arguably the mos notable of celtiberians , check this guy out . 
  [ viriathus ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/viriato ), 
   any proof that they are living better than rest of india or its just propaganda from portuguese . 
  met goans that returned to portugal . 
  real goans , not europeans coming back . 
  read countless articles about india under britain and goa under portugal . 
  however , given the tone of your comment , i doubt you 're interested in actual facts , so i 'm not inclined to expand on this . 
   are you telling me local goans are incapable of developing themselves that only portuguese have some kind of power to develop people from other parts of world ? 
  obviously you lack reading skills , as i maintained throughout my post that goans were autonomous and could very well be independent . 
  not once did i imply it was due to the portuguese , in fact , i clearly stated that goans had status in the portuguese empire , proof they were regarded as highly capable , intelligent people . 
   then why does your economy lagging ? 
  now what 's that got to do with anything being discussed here ? 
  i almost feel tempted to reply to you in the same manner and mention something about sanitation and rapes , but that would ultimately be very unfair to all indians . 
  i do n't mistake the tree for the forest , and it seems to me you took my posts a bit too personally . 
  cognitive dissonance will do that for you . 
  i am trying to convey a general opinion in portuguese society , not my personal view on these matters , which would take quite a bit a to expand on . 
   i do n't see how they could 've been separate states . 
  they 're too small , and do n't have enough historical base to support nationalism . 
  [ a list of small , yet independent states . 
  ] ( http://geography.about.com/cs/countries/a/smallcountries.htm ) i 'll address the second part of your assumption next . 
   as for the claims , the regions share language , history and religion with regions around it and except for the portuguese rule they are the same . 
  konkani is spoken in goa and also as far as regions ~ 350 km away . 
  marathi is spoken in goa and also pretty much in every region surrounding goa , and even as far off as ~ 1000 km away . 
  daman & diu are pretty much really tiny , barely-populated-with-tribals fishing/tourist spots . 
  the french too ceded their enclaves , although peacefully . 
  not sure what you mean here . 
  the portuguese were in goa for nearly 500 years , so you ca n't simply neglect the influence of portuguese culture in these communities . 
  a good example is galicia , a spanish region north of portugal . 
  portuguese culture is also known as the galaico-portuguese culture due to their common roots . 
  however , after all these centuries of being separated , galicians are now closer to the spanish ( castillian ) culture than portuguese . 
  the same thing happened in goa . 
  goans had their own culture by the time they were annexed by india , a culture that was formed by both their own indian roots and european costumes/religion . 
  which brings me to the propaganda pushed by nehru , that the portuguese were colonial masters just like the english and that he 'd be * freeing * goans from the claws of the portuguese . 
  in fact , goan was more autonomous during portuguese rule than it ever was under india . 
  most of the administration was done by goans , and many goans became high society members in portugal . 
  many of these families still have relevant positions in portuguese politics . 
  so yeah , there was a lot of prejudice and a need to galvanize the indian people by * defeating * the european colonizer by invading a tiny piece of land where people were by all accounts living better than in the rest of india . 
  that is n't to say portugal has or had any rights to goa , but it certainly should give goans legitimacy to govern themselves if they chose to . 
  finally , portugal did purpose the indian government the same deal we had with the chinese . 
  transitional period , and then a smooth transfer . 
  but that would n't have much appeal to the then highly nationalistic young india . 
  looking at how macau turned out , i personally think that would 've benefited goans the most . 
  goa and macao are special cases , opposite in every way . 
  macao was handed peacefully to china in 1999 , and many of the portuguese living there returned to portugal . 
  portuguese is still an official language there but since macau is a part of china , there is n't much interactivity with the region . 
  china , however , is a big investor in portugal and has bought our public energy company , mainly due to it 's know-how in renewable energy generation . 
  in 500 years , this is likely a high point in cino-portuguese relations . 
  goa is a whole different matter . 
  there are plenty of goans and goan descendants in portuguese society , aswell as goan influence in portuguese cousine , but any and all connection with the territory of goa ended when nehru invaded . 
  portugal made a weak attempt at pushing for it 's independence later , but with no success . 
  afaik , goans still have a right to portuguese citizenship , and some in goa try to keep their connection to portuguese culture alive , but not in enough numbers to justify a formal `` relationship '' . 
  goa , daman and diu are probably the least mentioned ex-colonies in contemporary portugal . 
  my personal take is that of all the colonies , they are the only ones that got annexed by another country and did n't manage to become independent states . 
  some feel that we failed goans , even when there was literally nothing to be done . 
  it 's a complex situation since india 's claims about goa and portugal in the past were highly prejudicial and unlike china , portugal does n't regard india as a * reliable * partner . 
  * ** angola ** i 'd say there 's more of a business relationship with angola , rather than friendship . 
  many portuguese have fond feelings for the country , but many angolans still look at the portuguese as those to blame for all their problems . 
  luckily not all , and many portuguese are emigrating there to get better paying jobs . 
  some stay but most ca n't adapt to the anacronisms of angola . 
  truth be told , angola is probably the least favourite ex-colony of portugal , for more reasons than i care to develop in this post . 
  many angolans came to portugal in the past decades in search of a better education and a better life . 
  some created new roots here , others used their education and go back to work in angola 's big companies ( mostly those with connections ) . 
  * ** cape verde ** * ** s. tom\u00e9 e pr\u00edncipe ** our relationship with cape verde and s. tom\u00e9 is pretty similar in every way . 
  we 've taken thousands of people over the years and there 's big comunities of people from these countries in portugal . 
  in portugal the image of these countries is more positive than that of angola .

  awesome countries for some vacation too . 
  * ** mozambique ** mozambique has been somewhat neglected diplomatically in recent years , despite having a big portuguese community and many portuguese of mozambique origin living in portugal . 
  recently though , portugal participated in an initiative to end military operations from renamo , with the portuguese embassador travelling to deep mozambique with other international dignataries , to escort afonso dhlakama , renamo 's leader , to maputo safely . 
  * ** guin\u00e9-bissau ** portuguese relations with the current government in bissau are strained after a chain of coups , accusations from the military ( the same that are involved in drug trafficking ) that the portuguese and angolans wanted to take over their military and more recently the forcing of syrian refugees into a tap airplane , breaking the trust of both the portuguese government and tap , which led to the decision to stop flying to bissau . 
  the situation seems to be deescalating , and flights may resume soon .

  a team of local women run the kitchen , and they too modify their menu based on what the farms are growing , but a near constant is roasted kid with stewed potatoes and grilled alheira , a fowl-and-bread stuffed sausage . 
  according to my waitress , it was portuguese jews who first made alheira , during the years of the inquisition , so that they could `` prove '' their christianity if necessary by eating a secretly pork-free sausage ( jewish dietary laws prohibit eating pork ) . 
  fact or fable , i could n't help thinking that nearly every dish i ate during this feeding frenzy in the douro came with a back story , and then i remembered something rui martins said to me a few days earlier : `` history is an ingredient in every recipe we cook in the douro , whether it 's newly invented or centuries old . '', 
  it 's rather obvious , is n't it ? 
  well the council of europe is also not europe .

  you have the least representative parliament in the entire continent thanks to your electoral system . 
  you should be the one worried with the fact that it 's so easy for a minority to get full power in britain even if they 're far from representing half of the population . . 
  the eu parliament is more representative of the uk voters than your national parliament . 
  just look to ukip 's group in one and the other ... 
  it 's like a disaster in slow motion ... and it can still be avoided , just quite a few people on several positions and countries need to swallow some pride and be a bit more pragmatic . 
  scary stuff .

  ps : wow , when you zoom out you can kind of see a world map above it , well , africa is definitely there . 
   it 's borderline insane . 
  and yet it 's still considered one of the countries with the most religious freedom in the world . 
  you do realize very few countries have separation between state and church , right ? 
  it 's far from being the norm , even in europe . 
   i say that what that guy did is a crime in portugal . 
  i do n't see how . 
  he did n't insult a person for their religion . 
  he mocked a religion . 
  different things . 
  i 'm not saying the law is perfect , i merely explained what it said as the person that quoted it did not explain it correctly . 
  and i think you could argue in court that this law could indeed be used to protect an atheist that was mocked for being an atheist . 
  which again is a different story than mocking atheism for instance . 
  portugal does n't have a blasphemy law and has separation of state and church , even if not enforced as strongly as in france . 
  the quoted law is a law against insulting people for their religion or vandalizing temples . 
  the quoted protuguese article says explicitly `` insulting someone for their religion '' . 
  that is very different from `` insulting a religion '' . 
  no is not . 
  the text you quoted is rather clear . 
  `` insulting someone for their religion '' . 
  i find it hilarious that you missed to understand that the portuguese code addresses the issue of insulting someone for their religion or vandalizing a temple or cemetery . 
  in no way does it forbid from mocking a religion . 
  actually i do n't find it hilarious , i find it tragic that people keep make the confusion between religion and people , people have rights , people should n't be discriminated against . 
  and then again , even the portuguese law forbade blasphemy it would be no impediment for me to share this link . 
  why should it be ? 
  the inquisition comes centuries after independence . 
  and it was a demand to introduce it as part of an agreement about a royal wedding with a spanish princess . 
   we had no protestants . 
  there were a few , and a few were killed . 
   secular democracy should lead by example . 
  i agree with you . 
  still , my gut feeling differs . 
  yeah , in portugal was always catholics killing protestants , never the other way around . 
  what !, 
  i could n't find anywhere their definition of `` child marriage '' . 
  seems to me suspiciously high in some countries , such as cuba . 
  do they consider any marriage bellow 18 a child marriage ? 
  no idea , it 's not mentioned anywhere . . it 's not even clear if it 's the same age limit to all countries . 
  maybe cause the consequences are quite different to boys and girls ? 
  maybe because teen pregnancy fucks up your career/education prospects . . 
  why is the eu being anti-democratic ? 
  the eu always warned about the consequences of the vote and kept its position . 
  `` no free market without free movement of people '' . 
  the eu has been very much in favor of respecting the result of the vote , ca n't be more democratic than this .

  certainly , but if pulls off the plug of electronic device replacing the bells at max he gets kicked out from the church ... if the device gets damaged he would get prosecuted and would have to pay for the damages .

deep-fried mars bars,

  are you retarded ? 
  if you exclude the refuges from syria the amount of people coming from other places should be about the same as it as been all the other years prior . 
  if the measures have been good enough for the other years they should not need major changes to the years to come, 
  the way we been doing until now, 
  i 'm talking about the syrian refugees only , to the rest of them , most wo n't be given refugee status, 
  there are not 40 million syrians in the world , the frog is being boiled slowly , and the maximum temperature is 4 million, 
  it 's 4 million max , a totally manageable number, 
  austria and germany introduced border checks temporarily , they didnt built a fence . 
  eu is falling to adress the problem because of oposition from countries like hungary . 
  regarding the ones that are not runing from war , i agree that they should not be granted stay , but that is no reason for treating everyone the way the hungarian goverment is treating them, 
  you ask can all people from poor contries come , when you should first ask do all peoples from poor countries want to come . 
  and the answer to that question would be no . 
  the refugees are not runing from their country because they want to , they are not runing because they were poor , they are runing because of war , because there is no more life to be had in their place of origin , because there are mad men running around wanting to cut their heads and enslave their women and children . 
  that 's what makes them want to come . 
  and when you realise this , you realise that there is a limited number to those who can come , and that number will be the answer to your question . 
  that number is around 4 millions and they dont need and indeed are not coming all to europe , only about 5 % are coming , and that number is completely manageable . 
  people from all over the world can and indeed come to europe . 
  there are lots of nigerians , congolese , bangladeshi and so on living in europe right now . 
  your premise makes no sense, 
  i fail to see the competence in beating up unarmed people runing from war or erecting walls whith other schengen countries , and boicoting the only viable solution to the crises . 
   very poor people from all over the world like from hungary, 
   most people i know applauded hungarians the proverbial circlejerk,

  formidable interpretation, 
  we are not dying out , we are spreading out , you will find portuguese people having babies everywhere , just not in portugal, 
  no , but they are the victims in this one, 
  i know , these are beasts of no nation , but the still point stands , being rutheless migh make you fell like you are doing something , but in reallity it 's like fighting a dandelion infestation by kicking them around , you are just sowing the seeds for more problems in the future . 
  remember in roman times cristians used to be trown at lions in public gory spetacles , but that did n't got rid of cristianity , it just helped it grow faster , and jews were persecuted viciouly throughout the ages but that didnt got rid of them , comunist were brutaly hunted down in latin america , and that didnt stop them either . 
  it doesnt matter the ideology , you ca n't crush it by sheer brute force . 
  even if we do all of that the attacks wont stop , franco tried that in spain and it didnt stop eta , tatcher tried that in northern ireland and it didnt stop ira , erdogan tried that and it did n't stop pkk , even putin and xi jinping are relatively powerless against terrorists . 
  try harder , one day you will, 
  why are they so oposed to muslims if they share so much political views with them ? 
   gypsies straight out refuse to be a part of the society . 
  that 's true , lots of gypsies are cunts , but you can not claim gypsies in general are cunts , gypsies are like you and me and react to the same incentives in the same way as us , when a gypsie comits a crime you should blame the individual and not everyone as you were doing , i think that that is just common sense . 
  what you were claimming about the gypses is exactly , almost word by word , what in western europe used to be claimed about eastern europeans , i once was robed by an eastern european , but guess what , i do n't think that every eastern european should be put in jail or be deported , only that single cunt, 
  what you mean gypsies do n't integrate , there are gypsies that won nobel prizes ( wich no slovak ever did ) , their contributions to european art ca n't be overstated , like the contributions to flamenco either as dancers or players , there are artists that defined eras like django reinhart , or were descendant from gypsies like charlie chaplin , there are gypsies that became nobles in europe or elected as presidents , like juscelino kubitschek , the founder of the brazilian capital and arguably one of the best presidents of brazil . 
  about the crime statistcs you do n't hear much about gypsie crime in the usa or south america or other places outside europe , it 's not that it is inexistent , it 's just that it is more or less on the national average , i would guess that the lack of oportunities for gypsies and the prejudice people have against them in europe are the force stoking the flames of gypsie crime,

  is this ok with eu laws ?

  not to mention constitutionally illegal . 
  portugal has them too . 
  we give german cars as prize . 
  it 's a cause of great shaming to my country . 
  not only are the prizes made entirely abroad , it 's unlikely to the average citizen to keep up with maintenance , leading to further debt and asset arrest . 
  it 's pathetic . 
  they could 've given other prizes , like 10 year personal tax exemption , or even money . 
  they instead appeal to a sense of vanity and stupidity that it 's so insulting it infuriates me . 
  trendy , are n't we ? 
  such beautiful metaphor . 
  my wife uses carrots ( sex ) whenever she wants something from me or just get off . 
  my customers use carrots ( money ) to seduce me to work for them . 
  companies give `` carrots ( good salaries and working conditions ) to make sure workers remain productive and loyal . 
  states give carrots ( low taxation ) to corporations and big business . 
  europe uses carrots ( civilized and sophisticated conditions infrastructure and economical stability ) to poor peripheral countries with a bad history of unneighborly abuse - russia . 
  i 'm anti-eu and get huge amounts of down votes . 
  i 'm weary and suspicious of german political interests and interference over other peripheral countries . 
  paying the tab , which they 're not by the way , does n't excuse anything and everything germany does or says . 
  we 're not slaves . 
  people ca n't be bought . 
  if you think they can , you should be bought and sold for tree fiddy . 
  people do n't abide by reddiquette . 
  they vote like agreeing or disagreeing . 
  in that sense , / r/europe is no better than an intolerant net mob . 
  not really a big thing , because most subs are . 
  but it sterilizes any discussion . 
  there 's also the rampant islamophilia . 
  people criticizing islam or immigration just get banned or massively down voted . 
  it 's pathetic when we ca n't have an opinion on cultural traits . 
  it always gets reduced to racism ... 
  i do n't like people with signs threatening other people or treating women children and gay people as something worse than animals . 
  if you 're going to pull a relativity curtain on that , then you 're just as bad as them , if not worse !, 
  another thing that repulses me is the naive idealistic mentality that does not correlate with the world we live in . 
  people go out of their way to argue with someone , despite having no experience with the issue being discussed . 
  it ranges from dealing gypsies to some people 's work ethic , to beverages and food . 
  redditors are not anthropologists with a thesis on issues . 
  they 're normal people with limited view of the world and sharing experiences . 
  counter point with your own experiences . 
  we are not representing our countries on the un table . 
  oh god , we should be glad we 're not !, 
  astroturfing is also an issue . 
  the love for mother russia is getting out of hand . 
  the amount of down votes in some well thought and well written comments only makes me think that there 's a lot of blind hatred for someone or just astroturfing . 
  also , there are too many americans voicing their opinions over things they know nothing about . 
  i like their input whenever possible in threads , just do n't write like you know the cure for europe 's problems . 
  it goes the other way round too . 
  surely you realize this madman 's only role there ( duma ) is to make putin seem moderate , right ? 
  that 's the spirit . 
  enjoy your string of upvotes . 
  southern bashing in 3 , 2 , oh , it already started . 
  mitigate ? 
  i think it 's more like prolong as long as possible so as to reap the most benefits for the cronies and banksters . 
  welcome to the eu of the 21 ^ st century . 
  a thing i do n't want to be a part of . 
  the eu does n't even want to insulate weaker economies . 
  there 's too much profit in gangrening the periphery . 
  they got help the cronies recoup the losses from 2008 wall street debacle , particularly german banks . 
  but the funny part is reading and listening to eu officials claiming they 're doing everything to protect those countries , when they do the opposite . 
  they may seem insane to you . 
  i see them as quite legitimate . 
  i simply lost any kind of faith/trust towards the eu . 
  it may have had a noble principle once , decades ago , but that spirit somehow got lost/died/cracked under financial pressures . 
  to me , the eu is like heroin to a junkie . 
  it is the the main drive behind public debt and a haven of high level corruption . 
  i do n't know where we 'd be without the eu , because that 's now in a different universe , but i 'd risk saying we 'd probably be in a lot better place than where we are now . 
  we 'd at least be in control of our own currency , economy and resources . 
  certainly with better prospects than eking out an existence with a zombie economy and rampant unemployment . 
  some 5 to 10 % of the country has left . 
  broken families . 
  rising living costs . 
  bleak future . 
  all for what ? 
  to honor commitments of usury ? 
  being hung out to dry by the eu so that a few banks can reap pornographic interest rates ? 
  forced privatizations ? 
  at sale price ? 
  into the hands of corporate cronies and other foreign party financiers ? 
  what is this ? 
  a second ussr ? 
  being told what to buy and what to sell by the eu ? 
  and what to legislate ? 
  to perpetuate cronies and shady deals within the eu and with no benefit to the portuguese people , like submarines , trains and other crappy corrupted deals ? 
  to cut down or halt once vital and self-sustainable areas ? 
  to throw away precious natural resources in land and in the ocean ? 
  the eu is a perverse joke . 
  ran by xenophobic near comic book level villains !, 
  they aim get rich and ahead by dismantling and disenfranchising the periphery of europe who they view and treat as subhumans , for hundreds of years . 
  you know that would pretty much guarantee the destruction of at least an hemisphere , right ? 
  who will give a shit about an economy when we 're missing an hemisphere and starving to death ? 
  russia does n't respect any convention of war , and you saw it with the false flags , unmarked paramilitary , laying of landmines ... we have a belligerent country with a huge dead man 's switch and no political opposition at home . 
  it was just a matter of time until this day would come . 
  ever since we developed the first nuclear warhead . 
  many saw it coming decades ago . 
  there is only one way out of this . 
  do nothing and quietly wait for it to blow over , preferably at a pub getting wasted because this is all too heavy to cope with . 
  let 's hope russia does n't go all in sweeping up other countries parts .

  greece unfortunately looks like a very special case . 
  one where government incompetence plunged the country into massive debt and now they 're victimizing themselves . 
  not that they 're fully to blame , stricter regulation to greek public finance would have discover these issues prematurely but unfortunately now there 's that and the greeks do n't seem to be too pleased about the union 's response . . 
  i honestly do n't think germany is to blame , they 're in fact doing a lot to keep us together , though i 'm also fully aware greece is having a hard time and we ca n't just demand them paying up everything , though it must be clear that careless spending of other people 's money just is n't something allowed . 
   it was only 60 years ago there was war here , and the wall only fell 30 years ago . 
  that 's not very long really . 
  now with the internet , with companies working all over europe and with the easiness one crosses a border , we 're pretty much on the same page regarding everything . 
  and 60 years a long time ago . 
  i ca n't say we 're growing too fast , perhaps what we are is not being cautious enough . 
   i was born almost 19 years ago , portugal has been in the eu for 26 years , it 's not a long time ago , sure , but still , i consider myself a portuguese and an european at the same time . 
  i mean , there 's the language barrier where we both had to learn english to communicate with each other , but once you past that , are we really that different ? 
  i mean , i 'm pretty sure my lack of blond hair , my lack of light skin tone or my difficulties in coping with very cold temperatures would make it difficult for me to pass for a scandinavian , but if you consider only ideological and political issues , are we really that different ? 
  even here in this subreddit , despite everything , we agree so much on pretty much everything !, 
  we 're not / r/canada or / r/unitedkingdom but we 're certainly close , i think even / r/portugal disagrees amongst itself much more than / r/europe !, 
  yugoslavia or the ussr ca n't really be used as an argument against the eu , or can they ? 
  if anything , they demonstrate how peaceful things are within the eu , even when there 's still plenty of conflict and violence in other parts of the world . 
   and if there has to be a union of some sort , i would prefer and think it would work better for scandinavia to have it 's own union . 
  myself , i 'd rather have an european-wide union , possibly divided in smaller unions ( like scandinavia , iberia , low countries ) for balancing things among the union for balancing and administrative purposes . 
  i mean , you 're closer to sweden and we 're closer to spain , but overall we 're still very similar , and in the global scheme of things , we 'd be better off if we acted as one , even if internally we remained fairly separated . 
  it 's perfectly possible to care for both the uk ( or any other member-state ) and the eu . 
   would it even be feasible ? 
  as of now , there are massive problems just having a common currency , and the cracks are starting show due to it . 
  how about the usa , brazil or russia ? 
   personally , i dream of a purely scandinavian union . 
  but , it 's probably too late for that now . 
  the swedish might disagree . 
  it would be a sad day if we were all ruled by a retard , literally . 
  history also showed we ca n't go 50 years without fighting amongst ourselves . 
  we are writing history . 
  port wine is here it 's at , or so i 'm told . 
  x ) not that i know too much about it , other than some champagne or beer here and there , i hardly drink . 
  oh , ok , the way you mentioned , it seems like most of the uk was clearly against such an idea . 
  and it might be , but still , i guess it 's better than nothing , right ? 
   i 've pondered about a union of regions , where instead of having a more integrated eu , we focus on regional integration ( such as scandinavia , iberia and other regions starting political integration ) . 
  i fully agree , i also think about this quite often , how to balance europe from within without hurting the interests of some groups by bundling too different countries . 
  countries like malta should n't have such influence in the whole scheme of things but they also should n't be just tied to the italians , do you understand what i 'm trying to say ? 
   my mum is dutch and my father swedish , although i was living in madrid until a few weeks ago . 
  my secondary school was an international british school , and as such i ca n't fully identify with any one nationality . 
  this in turns i 'm quite comfortable with pan-european ideas . 
  you do n't need any of that to be a strong european supporter . 
  :p i 'm born and raised in portugal and only started learning english when i was 10 , in the 5th grade . 
  also , my parents were both born in africa , my mother in angola and my father in congo . 
  nevertheless , i also am a supporter of a stronger europe as we 're clearly better when united rather than separated and this union at half-steam is n't clearly working as intended . 
  gosh , british politicians do seem to have a good time . 
  thanks for the link though , it 's interesting to see the reaction of the british conservative euroskeptics to a british-led eu government by a former labour pm . 
  is that sort-of-famous speech something widely agreed there ? 
   i fear many of our continental amigos are too distrustful and nationalist to accept such a thing . 
  me too , but if they put their own country above us all , too bad for them , we ca n't and should n't try to force them into a democratic union . 
  look at it from another way , if someone leaves , then they clearly were n't committed enough and would probably be more of a burden and less of a benefit . 
  besides , it might take some time to get used to , the original eec only had 6 member-states , i guess the door should be open for those who only later decide to take full responsibility for this european project . 
   i think that if we are to initiate such an ambitious endeavour , it really will be a make or break moment . 
  me too , and hopefully when it happens everything will go smoothly . 
  i just wish we got this over quickly and did n't drag things too much . 
   what i think would be an efficient platform for such an initiative is to urge closer ties among the pan-european/ep parties , so that they may have a more formal structure from whence such a candidate could come . 
  certainly , i 'd also enjoy if european parties were more important and widely discussed , because they 're hardly even on the news . 
  it 's hard to take them seriously if nobody ever knows or talks about them . 
  btw , do you mind me asking from which country are you from ? 
  it 's because of the `` continental amigos '' part :p, 
  i do n't think it 's right to advertise products like that , the `` buy from what 's ours - buy portuguese '' that are everywhere . 
  we are in a free market , portuguese products deserve no unfair advantage to those of other european countries , it 's stupid protectionism , if some national companies ca n't survive on their own , too bad , it should n't be the consumer the one having to pay for their unsustainability . 
  they should be `` buy european because we can guarantee this and this and that '' , not `` buy portuguese/spanish/whatever because we all benefit from it '' , which is just plain wrong . 
   although i would vote in favour of a new charismatic face , one that is not as ` tainted ' ( for lack of a better word ) with national politics . 
  certainly , though taint of national politics that might not be so bad , as that would demonstrate that person 's past experience and one could evaluate their previous work before putting them in such an important role ; whereas new faces , no matter how charismatic , can always lead to great disappointments . 
  probably because the flights were canceled ? 
  it happens all the time . 
  to be honest , i really do n't care if it 's the chicken or the egg that comes first , in this case we need both a strong figurehead and a central european authority put in office by all europeans , a state that represents us as a whole to the outside world and that effectively sets the guidelines for european governance . 
  would n't someone like blair or merkel be more suited as an european leader than barroso or rompuy which never were that influential and that do n't really hold that much power ? 
  i live outside of britain and i do n't really dislike him . 
  sure , he 's a bit too euroskeptical but i guess that 's what he has to do to be in office there . 
  despite his flaws , if i were british , i 'd vote for him . 
  he 's not perfect but he 's not an idiot like ed miliband . 
  i would n't take it too seriously , it says france approval rating of sarkozy is 56 % and he lost his elections . 
  we could however get someone influential as the president and giving more power to the european parliament to govern over major issues , while local level government remained mostly as it is now . 
  i remember my 11th grade economics teacher talking about the eu and saying it was quite stupid for them to get van rompuy so high up in there when there were other people much more suited ( he gave the example of tony blair ) . 
  he also mentioned that one of the things that still divide us considerably is the lack of a good figurehead , someone who can represent all of us , and it 's indeed true that the eu still talks like 27 independent entities and not like one to the outside world . 
   public spending is the engine of the economy in every country . 
  no , it 's not , in fact you have places with reduced public spending and healthy economies ( for example , hong kong , india or south korea ) and lots of countries with a lot of public spending who are having very difficult times in paying their debts ( for example , greece ) . 
  and even while it 's true that public spending can be used to boost the economy in the short term , that needs to be well-spent money , continuing to sustain to the fullest an welfare system without first having the income to pay for it is unsustainable and would not achieve the goal of economic growth . 
   the extent to which cuts would be made in greece would severely harm their internal market , and they do n't have a lot of exports . 
  in a globalized world , it 's a mistake to only rely on the internal market . 
  greece also has to adjust its economy to be more competitive , it has to face competition not only within the eu but also from the rest of the world , otherwise there ca n't be too bright prospects about the future . 
  you mean reducing public spending in a crisis caused by too much public spending is gutting the greek economy ? 
  how does that work ? 
  get out . 
   the possibility that spain wanted to halt our independence using the army . 
  that does n't really seem viable to them , not within the eu it does n't . 
  anyway , i understand your grievances and you do seem have a point . 
  however , as a third party , i think it would still be better for all of us europeans if you managed to get want you want from spain without having to declare independence and break away from it , as both catalonia and spain would be stronger if they were unified as they have been for so long and i guess that can only be beneficial for the eu as a whole . 
   for every euro in taxes that is collected in catalonia , forty three cents are spent in other regions of spain that can also be said about the money collected in taxes in germany and then spent in aiding greece . 
  is it really fiscal theft or is it just some wealth redistribution from the wealthiest to the most in need through taxes ? 
  not that i 'm arguing for taxes , but you 're not really being robbed , are you ? 
  you also benefit from it , correct ? 
   plus the spanish media is always attacking the catalan for using their language . 
  that 's not an issue with the spanish government or state figures , or is it ? 
  at least , as an outsider , it seems to be that 's an issue regarding the spanish media , you ca n't blame the king for that or being independent from spain would make the spanish media less interested in attacking catalan ( though i do n't know how can they attack an officially recognized language ) . 
  i understand what you 're trying to say , however i still get a bit concerned because i wonder how can we achieve further european integration if even within some countries there 's seems to more of a divide and not an union , and we 're talking about spain and you mentioned scotland , these countries have been unified since the xv century and 1707 . . 
  it 's just that you 're so similar and have been part of the same country for so long , if you have some difficulties in remaining unified , then the eu hardly stands a chance , which is sad , we clearly are better off united than we are separated and arguing with each other . . 
   no , because they would all be part of the eu anyway that 's not true even within the eu . 
  for example , luxembourg does n't have the same influence as france and malta does n't have the same influence as italy . 
  you could say that while the island of corsica or sardinia are not independent from france and italy , respectively , they both benefit from having a more influential voice within the union than those in luxembourg or malta .

when i said `` we '' i was including galicia . 
  culturally speaking it 's all the same area , even our language is much closer to one another than to castellan/spanish . 
  edit : you should know , i just noticed your flair , 
  we have a somewhat strong celtic cultural presence , especially in the north of the country . 
  this cultural presence extends further up north into galicia where as a mere curiosity vigo 's own football team is called celta de vigo . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/celtic_nations ) no celtic language has been spoken here in modern times but i would n't be surprised if a few words managed to find their way into our modern language . 
  this is just incredibly troubling . 
  i know small company that does their business out of greece . 
  nicest guys in that specific machining industry and quite frankly one of the best in the entire world at doing what they do - flawless pieces . 
  i seriously hope they do n't get kicked out of business or worse due to this whole circus . 
  i do n't think a reddit post would end up in any of our news outlets though . 
  i 'd be somewhat surprised if any of the `` big '' outlets even knew what reddit is . 
  maybe i 'm wrong . 
  we have a [ monarchist party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/people%27s_monarchist_party_%28portugal%29 ) . 
  you can somewhat feel how strong monarchism is in portugal if you take a look at our last [ legislative elections ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_legislative_election,_2011#results ) in 2011 and how well they fared . 
  wait a minute , i thought decriminalizing drugs was supposed to rampantly increase drug abuse over here . 
  what the hell are we doing wrong ? 
  do you have a flag ? 
  yes , but that sometimes depends if you 're traveling for leisure or business . 
  if you have plenty of time to enjoy yourself and like exploring and finding unexpected things in out of the common path places then satellite navigation is usually not that useful . 
  i have to admit i have n't used it much , every time i used it i was just playing around with it . 
  what i mostly use for navigation is a localized version of [ ndrive ] ( http://www.ndrive.com/ ) ( a local portuguese company , great local maps as a possible consequence ) called [ meo drive ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ndrive.androidtmndrive ) that got released through an agreement with local carriers . 
  it comes pre-loaded in some meo/tmn phones but it 's free on the play store if you have another carrier ( i 'm vodafone ) . 
  maps for the whole country and a couple of voices for portugal are free , maps for other countries have to be purchased and live traffic information requires a subscription i believe . 
  since i rarely leave the country it 's the ideal solution for me . 
  edit : recently i 've been trying to use [ waze ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze ) whenever possible and it 's great but you * must * have a data plan and it 's less than ideal for traveling abroad since having no internet access renders it a bit useless . 
  if you know ahead of time the general area where you 'll be you may want to start using the [ offline cache feature ] ( https://support.google.com/gmm/answer/2650377?hl=en ) . 
  it basically saves an area of the map for offline use . 
  lisbon is n't exactly a huge city but the feature can store it in it 's entirety and then a bit more of the suburbus on each side so it may help storing a whole chunk of maps of the surrounding areas whenever you have wifi internet access before you head somewhere . 
  delicatessen is a classic !, 
  i do n't think i 've seen the other two though , thanks for the heads up . 
  this is perfect !, 
  thanks . 
  that explains a lot , i was a bit confused trying to find a connection between the movie and the ad when the connection was in fact between the two actors , 
  i recognize these two from [ rare exports : a christmas tale ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1401143/ ) , they play father and son in it . 
  i suppose the advertisement is in some way related to the movie ? 
  do they ( the actors ) do more stuff together or was this a one off movie and ad to go with it ? 
  i recently watched both [ trolljegeren ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740707 ) and rare exports and though they 're both really cheesy and terrible at times i really enjoyed them . 
  if you know of any more horror/sci fi/fantastic nordic or generally european movies please let me know . 
  other than these two the only other european movies going into this kind of genres that i know of were [ d\u00f8d sn\u00f8 ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1278340/ ) , [ iron sky ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034314/ ) and [ rec ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1038988/ ) . 
  some guillermo del toro 's movies could be added to the list but they 're a bit more serious and not exactly aiming for the level of cheesiness the others achieve . 
  portuguese , spanish , italians and to some extent romanian if we speak * really * slow and wave our hands up and down a lot we can pretty much figure out what the other is saying . 
  portuguese people sometimes have to mix it up a bit with a brazilian accent or some other tricks because our language is weird and sounds like we 're talking russian when compared to the others . 
  french on the other hand . . you might as well be speaking cantonese to me . 
  all i 'm getting is a pay wall when trying to read the article . 
  any chance of a mirror or copy ? 
  huh ? 
  i can see why it 's harder to understand , portuguese from portugal is a very monotone language . 
  i 've been mistaken as a russian while abroad and talking portuguese with some friends a number of times . 
  came to the conclusion the two languages sound eerily similar for something that could n't be so different . 
  especially the way we pronounce some words with `` ch '' , `` s '' and `` j '' in them . 
  out of curiosity , do you also have issues understanding galician people ? 
  whenever i hear them talk it sounds a lot more like portuguese than traditional spanish/castillan for some reason and most of the time we do n't have to resort to portu\u00f1ol to make ourselves understood . 
  my uncle lived near madrid for some years and everyone thought he was galician because of his accent until he told them he was portuguese . 
  portu\u00f1ol is our way of ending up speaking portuguese just the same but with a few adapted words and not in a such a monotone fashion . 
  it may take some time but we end up understanding each other  i do n't think it 'd be the case if any of us were talking to e.g. 
  a polish or czech guy . 
  you should try listening to romanian , i think you 'll be amazed how easilly you can make out what they 're saying without much effort . 
  got ta love latin derivatives . 
  portuguese , spanish , italian and romanian if no one is speaking it too fast we can all figure out what the other is saying . 
  french is also a derivative but it 's a heck of a lot harder to figure out what they 're saying if you never had lessons . 
  yep , only options i had when in school was mandatory english and optional french/german ( one or the other ) . 
  it 's been a while since i finished school so i have no idea how it is now but i 've never heard of anyone taking spanish classes . 
  i 'd go as far as to say there 'd be no advantage to taking spanish classes since we already understand each other well enough provided no one is speaking too fast . 
  when i visit my relatives in spain we have no issues whatsoever making ourselves understood , they speak in spanish and i speak in portuguese . 
  they 're not even from galicia where their language is closer to portuguese than spanish , they 're all mostly from andaluzia . 
  [ meanwhile in neighbouring portugal . . ] ( http://www.neowin.net/news/file-sharing-copyright-material-considered-legal-in-portugal ), 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  am i wrong when i think of the uk mostly as a services provider ? 
  i ca n't think of any industry where they 'd survive on their own in case of any major conflict . 
  admittedly i 'm not the most knowledgeable person on the subject , could someone maybe shed some light on this ? 
  edit : i do n't mean to be snide , genuinely curious . 
  [ prism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prism_%28surveillance_program%29 ), 
  we have a weird relationship with the spaniards . 
  when paulo futre went to play for atl\u00e9tico madrid their supporters used to call him names because he was portuguese . 
  eventually he made it to team captain and atl\u00e9tico supporters kept on calling him names because he was portuguese . 
  when asked about it they replied they called him names * exactly * because he was portuguese , if he was an english man they would n't call him names ... but he sure as hell would n't be team captain either . 
  that pretty much sums up the kind of relationship we have with them . 
  on the short term , sure . 
  but do n't forget you 'll have to pay back the money you borrow , eventually . 
  if those airports and highways create no revenue at all , where exactly will you get the money to pay the debt ? 
  that was our biggest mistake and what threw portugal into today 's situation . 
  edit : also , it did n't exactly result in more local people being hired . 
  it resulted in cheap workforce being imported by the construction contractors . 
  somewhat large quantities of mostly illegal immigrants in some cases . 
  edit 2 : here 's an [ example ] ( http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/only-five-thousand-passengers-used-beja-airport-in-two-years/28229 ) . 
  it was clear at the time such a small country would have no need for an airport there ( porto/lisbon/faro airports are perfectly capable of serving the whole country ) , it 's even more clear right now . 
  corruption and terrible politicians went ahead with it , spent millions of euros ... and now the entire population has to pay for it . 
  and here 's the kicker , they wanted to build * another * airport in lisbon before the crisis started to hit us with a stick . 
  and get ready for airports and highways that no one uses or needs . 
   of course , everytime some annointed politicians pretend to do `` good '' and `` in the name of the workers '' this sounds so encouraging . 
  but , unintended consequences are alaways waiting just around the corner . 
  i 'm forced to agree with you on this part , not so much on the first paragraph . 
  working conditions here in portugal are coming closer and closer to modern day slavery greatly due to the austerity measures , and we 're in the eu . 
  from the news reports i 've seen from greece they 've got it even worse . 
  there was a report i saw yesterday where an employer was trying to force employees to sign the documentation stating they had received wages since march ( ! ), 
  when they in fact had n't received anything at all . 
  and it 's not like they were decent wages to start with , 320 $ / month . 
  i do n't even know how are people supposed to be making a living working for no money since march . 
  i do n't get a lot of news from ukraine and i only know a couple of people from there but from what i gather things are n't exactly looking good either .

  pacifism and non violent action is also a staple of anarchism ( afterall it was tolstoy that inspired gandhi ) . 
  the problem of anarchism of our days is that due to the lack of organization between themselves and their repudiation of parliamentary politics anarchism is pretty much dead with the exception of small local groups . 
  not too common , i 'm not a big fan and in terms of fish we 've got better . 
  actually it 's not a thing people make at home . 
  it 's easy to do but they do n't are n't as good as bakeries have them . 
  lol . 
  the guy was against receiving refugees here , he gave explicit orders to limit visas to portugal and made sure that most refugees did n't stay in portugal . 
  i ` ts always helpful to point out that according to the show the second greatest portuguese ever was the historic leader of our communist party , \u00c1lvaro cunhal . 
  obviously a accurate representation of whatever portuguese think of our history . 
   we are thankful to him for organizing the country 's finances ( still one of the largest gold reserves in the world ) and the neutrality of world war ii . 
  easy when you just raise taxes on everything and reduce public spending , wow magic wizardry . 
  the same can apply to various european parliaments . 
  like in germany , france or italy . 
  for countries with large electoral districts ( or just one like the netherlands ) it 's probably a problem but then again it depends if one 's electoral system gives a bigger emphasis in a local representative than a more proportional result . 
  yes , more with palops ( portuguese speaking african countries ) than brazil . 
  every 6 months or so there 's a new economic/political problem with angola but apart from it it 's alright . 
  i think most portuguese are aware of our cultural and emotional links to the ex colonies ( a lot of middle aged portuguese grew up in angola , mozambique and so on ) . 
  culturally relations are at it 's best since decolonization as lusophone literature , music and even tv are commonplace here ( more in lisbon and its metropolitan area ) . 
  brazilian , angolan , cape verdian and guinean bissau musicians are standards in our music culture . 
  suffice to say that anselmo ralph , an angolan music star , quickly fills every venue across the country . 
  i do n't even understand what 's the advantage , you ca n't take 20 seconds to count coins or notes but apparently having your credit card in an app is okay ? 
  that 's mostly in traditional neighborhoods where the population is poorer . 
  also rain is ubiquitous from october to april . 
  in the end the reddit hivemind is the prime example of populism , be it right wing or left-wing . 
  leftist national liberation movements . 
  but is n't maltese politics quite centrist ? 
  i remember muscat 's government being very socially progressive but still knowing it 's a perfect bipartisan country i 'd wager each party must fight for the center ( what 's amazing is that they have stv and still their political scene is literally 2 parties ) . 
  like r/europe ? 
  :p but yeah i 've noticed the same , in general big subs and defaults are more politically volatile . 
  yeah we copy a lot of our sitcoms and series from spain . 
  nonsense of course it 's recognizable . 
  especially now that brazilian culture is so immersed in portuguese cultural life . 
  it 's the same with brazilians . 
  evangelicals are much more fanatic and pious than catholics . 
  it 's pretty good , it has a very chill vibe . 
  on the other hand saint-tomense portuguese at first seems like someone speaking portuguese with a western african french accent . 
  we have the same stuff . 
  altought it 's remarkable how giving spanish/portuguese citizenship for descendants of expelled jews is ok while the same does n't happen for descendants of * moriscos * . 
  because they elected openly neonazis that target roma ? 
  oliven\u00e7a is a non issue , even a dispute about some islands/rocks between madeira and can\u00e1rias is more worrying . 
  has n't been a problem since 76 . 
  too bad you latino americanos ca n't even decide on a single continental organization :p, 
  panels of saint vincent . 
  fado . 
  portrait of king sebastian . 
  brazilian evangelical churches , jehovah witnesses , orthodox christians ( romanians , bulgarians , moldavians , russians and ukrainians ) and african and brazilian mysticism . 
  and you could n't buy new shorts in montenegro of all places ? 
  would n't that be like a burguer in sweden ? 
  i would n't put myself in danger , last year or so about 5 portuguese were kidnapped . 
  what mozambique is safe ? 
  even with a low intensity civil war going on ? 
  at the same time a lot of leftist parties are very keen in a isolationist mindset regarding the eu . 
  british socialists and far-left parties campaigned for brexit even tough they 'll never be relevant ( and we can extend that to corbyn ) . 
  it 's mostly parties of the gue/ngl family . 
   while the sanctions were mostly symbolic in nature and haider did n't actually become prime minister , this is what i presume the eu would turn to as an example should something like you describe were to happen . 
  it 's already happening for about 3-4 years in hungary . 
  but at least rio was capital of an european nation !, 
  there were plans to rebuild lisbon in a different area after the 1755 earthquake , manuel da maia the chief engineer presented a plan to build a new lisbon between bel\u00e9m and alc\u00e2ntara or in present day estrela . 
  in the end the marquis of pombal went with levelling the remains of the medieval baixa and rebuilding the area according to a modern , rationalist grid . 
  not one of those countries has separatism and regional rivalries at the same scale spain has . 
  i do n't think spain has other option than toledo , you ca n't have your capital too far from the center . 
  that 's not only an english view it 's pretty much the standard western . 
  you 're not understanding to what we 're referring , it 's not genetics or the current ethnic composition of both uk or the us . 
  it 's the cultural mindset . 
  oh come on wasp is the default american culture . 
  breakfast : a bit of juice and last night 's pizza ; lunch : soup , pork stew with potatoes and cabbage , water and coffee ( expresso ) . 
  about 20 minutes ago i ate the rest of yesterday 's pizza and drank liquid yogurt . 
  for dinner i 'm not sure yet . 
  correction : not legal , decriminalized for consumption in small doses . 
  there was a user in / r/europe but being the sub so racist and full of hatred i would n't be surprised if he left . 
  no , it 's the system that perpetuates bipartidism . 
  unfortunate example with france , it 's `` em fran\u00e7a '' . 
  with inglaterra , espanha or fran\u00e7a it 's not linguistically correct to use a definite article but `` em '' . 
   most westerners do n't use the term `` eastern europe '' correctly when talking about geography or culture . 
  because it 's mostly a political term just like western europe . 
  there 's a reason why greece is in it but hungary is n't even tough athens is closer to china than budapest . 
  my my everyday there 's a new prefix for marxism . 
  i 'm interested , how come ? 
  would jesus descend to estonia and defeat the soviets ? 
  this reminds me of the consecration of russia . 
  exactly i kinda support strasbourg just because of the building and the gorgeous hemicycle . 
  ah that 's a recent thing , like 12-10 years . 
  do n't know the reason sorry but compared to brasil it 's nothing . 
  are there ? 
  are you referring to speedos as thongs ? 
  well to me that 's one ticket to depressionland . 
  to each it 's own . 
   well for me i merely do n't think that having symbols of bloody colonisation should belong in our flag anymore . 
  are you referring to the armillary sphere ? 
  i 'm quite anti-colonialist and the `` good '' imperial times but i fail to see how can you argue that the republican flag ( based the flag of a masonic secret society ) has anything to do with colonialism . 
   furthermore , do we seriously need to talk about anti-anything in our anthem ? 
  i , for one , believe our anthem should be about the beauty and love for our country , not about marching against cannons in sea and land . 
  well our anthem is already that , at least is n't like the french or the british with clear references to war or submission to monarchy . 
   i repeated it because that is literally how i was taught history , and in my opinion it 's not 100 % wrong , but the fact is that it also brought horrid oppression and censorship alongside with it with the bloody estado novo . 
  it is important to note its advantages but also exactly why its over and the suffering it brought , just like i was taught about nazi germany ( hitler did bring german economy back up to its feet , and developed infrastructure extensively , and even progressed in science a lot , but literally it was nazi germany ) . 
  there 's your problem , portuguese school history still relies extensivly on estado novo 's myths . 
  stuff like being somehow `` better '' colonizers , salazar fixing the economy ( it 's easy when you tax everyone and repress any dissenting opinion ) and many others . 
  about nazi germany , man you really should study how unsustainable the german economy was or how practically all nazi `` scientific discoveries '' did n't even met the scientific method . 
   portugal is no longer the colonial republic we once were , and we no longer are anti-british . 
  we are better and i believe we deserve a better representation of our country .

  fine . 
  even though that 's complete bs with ethoncentric undertones . 
  would you actually mind ? 
  i do n't identify myself with you guys nor do i have anything in common with you or any german . 
  the thing is , we leave and the `` party is over '' . 
  i suspect it 's no different than the portuguese military . 
  nepotism , absurdly excessive number of high ranking officers , huge salaries and automatic career progressions , high levels of administrative corruption . 
  try saying no to those guys . 
  that seems to be the golden rule across europe . 
  whoever has the gold makes up the rules . 
  this thread again ? 
  i can tell you that catholic countries have their stats skewed . 
  it 's common to lie on reports or even refuse coroner examination . 
  families pressure into having religious ceremonies and not even hinting to suicide . 
  who would 've known !? 
  germany profiting from the way the union 's internal market was designed !, 
  maybe , just maybe , it has to do with them calling the shots on nearly everything ? 
  and bullying other countries whenever it suits them ? 
  maybe these presumed selfless and sophisticated do-no-harm poster boys for modern europe are not so selfless after all . 
  in fact , maybe their full of skeletons in their closets . 
  maybe they 're hijacking this union into a modern reich to serve their own greedy interests . 
  love it !, 
  particularly the untied states . 
  the amount of confusion and grammar nazis coming out of the woodwork over this would be very fitting . 
  actually not , but given the self-victimization train has left the station and is going full speed ... everyone jump in !, 
  those poor upstanding roma gypsies are being discriminated against !, 
  it 's okay , because these are serbs were talking here - the most hated people in europe by europeans . 
  and kosovars being the ever self-victimized muslim bunch , can actually get away with everything . 
  from organ harvesting , slavery , brutal levels of criminality ... [ were it in reverse and everyone would be losing their shit at how evil serbs are . 
  ] ( http://weknowmemes.com/generator/uploads/generated/g1367990406140510432.jpg ) serbia should win a god damn medal for even continuing to exist in that powder keg they call the balkans . 
  and kosovo is a mafia state that should n't exist at all . 
  a union that deals in secrecy , not just from its citizens but sometimes from member states as well , is no union . 
  it does n't want citizen input , transparency or public discussion nor it adheres to democratic principles . 
  it merely wants to strengthen the cronyism and their immense profit . 
  let 's just agree to disband once and for all . 
  i hope that as he falls he brings down the entirety of the political corrupt cohorts that enabled them . 
  if he does that , then all his actions will be redeemed . 
  i suspect well over half of our countries current political heads are tainted with high level corruption and are more worthy of jail than public office . 
  this is the alcohol response everyone is looking for . 
  [ porto wine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/port_wine ) is simply delicious and ubiquitous in portugal . 
  as is [ moscatel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscatel ) , which is my favorite . 
  [ licor beir\u00e3o ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/licor_beir%c3%a3o ) is also a good liquor to gulp down after dinner . 
  in the summer , i enjoy a slightly sparkling and lighter [ ros\u00e9 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ros%c3%a9 ) . 
  but tea is my drink . 
  green tea in particular . 
  i drink copious amounts of tea every day . 
  i enjoy mixing green tea leaves with other , like eucalyptus leafs . 
  makes the drink even more refreshing . 
  no milk . 
  milk depresses me and puts me in a torpid state . 
  switzerland ? 
  full circle ? 
  that 's probably the lhc !, 
  omg !, 
  putin wants to create a black hole in the center of europe !, 
  q : hey u/khthon , how much do you feel like a citizen of the eu ? 
  that pic is a long standing joke among us actually . 
  i 've been receiving that old woman 's picture on my email pretty regularly since the dawn of the internet . 
  you see , portuguese excel at making fun of each other . 
  portuguese girl [ pic here ] ( http://ilikeitfunny.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/hot-fifa-world-cup-portuguese-girl-flag-bikini-face-painting-f78237.jpg ) . 
  nothing to write home about but definitely better than [ the one ] ( http://spf.fotolog.com/photo/63/25/20/clauser/1147469422_f.jpg ) i was expecting to see ... 
  bonus [ portuguese girl here ] ( http://www.lapatilla.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sara-sampaio-for-calzedonia-2013-008.jpg ) and [ here ] ( http://us.cdn281.fansshare.com/photos/sarasampaio/sara-sampaio-be-magazine-334984414.jpg ) . 
  what you find ridiculous i find hypocritical and discrediting . 
  yes , realpolitik is , sadly , all about self-interests !, 
  just do n't act surprised when things backfire spectacularly like in this situation . 
  as did afghanistan/iraq . 
  as did libya and many others that are following suit . 
  any sort of moral high ground is lost , when you value economic interests alone . 
  this in turn makes for political weakness , public distrust and epic levels of cynicism . 
  you want that ? 
  you think that is the solution to the worlds problems ? 
  it will broker the end of generational long standing conflicts ? 
  that 's the equivalent to building walls and not giving a damn on what happens on the other side . 
  i seriously think we should have moved past that point by now , in terms of civilization . 
  and being complacent or maybe a cynic , while a good coping strategy , does n't help anyone in the long run . 
  water and arable soil . 
  diverting or damming rivers . 
  fishing rights . 
  we 're a hungry bunch , like u/muupeerd said , and our eco footprints is unsustainable . 
  and global warming , which the usual optimists always ignore , will force millions into europe from africa and the middle east . 
  and when europeans surpass a couple of billion , then the stress will be too much . 
  aquifers will dry , food prices will soar and social unrest will follow . 
  also , to the same optimists claiming desalinization as a solution , thirst wo n't be a problem , mass watering of crops will . 
  and the process consumes much energy . 
  waiting for some technological miracle similar to the green revolution and nitrogen extraction . 
  also , peak phosphorous and soil exhaustion will play their part . 
  / u/sasquatchpl was pointing out the typical selfishness that dictates many eu countries foreign policy . 
  zero solidarity towards ailing countries is hardly a founding principle to push forward a union . 
  because it was not a dutch problem , they only cared for their economic interests , regardless of the killing and oppression elsewhere . 
  well , now it is a dutch problem and the diplomatic progression of things reads like a biblical parable . 
  it 's just not reached that tipping point . 
  take into account these are civilized educated and secular people with plenty of grief in their collective history . 
  if things continue to degrade , and all indicates it will , resistance will become organized . 
  future wars will likely be wars of insurgency , over control of natural resources and self-determination . 
  if you think terrorism is an abused label these days , wait for when the world starts hitting the many non-negotiable natural and economical limits . 
  it will be a fast progression from there to absolute chaos and i have no doubt the handling of such crisis by the eu will be poor and will hang the periphery to dry . 
  do n't be so sure . 
  things can go bad pretty fast . 
  wars are on a near horizon for europe . 
  and i suspect it will happen between europeans , again ...

he still got the 2/3 in the lasted election ? 
  i though he would win but not again like that . 
  i think it is sad what is happening in hungary , hope you guys can kick those undemocratic bush out someday . 
  not that our politicians are better , but they never get that kinda of power . 
  the portuguese numbers have been dropping , but i think is mostly because the government uses dome nice statistics shenanigans and only counts people that are registered in the employment institute . 
  so with lots a people emigrating , others do n't see benefits in keeping its registration if there unemployment subsidy ended , also its relatively easy to get you registration terminated if you forget to attend a meting . 
  so the numbers keep improving on paper , what i would like to see , is the number of employed people . 
  i know people who live there that do n't speak german , i think some of those requisites are for social services . 
  i do n't think the german government ca n't kick me out if i pay rent , even if i do n't have a job or have a job but do n't speak the language . 
  uk maybe ? 
  its incredible that here , the parties could use that rhetoric , given that we are under the eu and ecb ( and imf ) supervision , and used as scapegoats by some northern politics , but they do n't ( witch is a good thing ), 
  `` we '' do . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_qw99ogerk more in the south , and i particularly do n't like it, 
  lol given that is clearly right wing now , this guy seam a bit deluded . 
  anyway good that he did n't receive any award although for the complete wrong reasons, 
  just a lovely mild 48 years ... / s sorry , but i 'm not a fan of old regime apologism, 
  i think you hit the nail with that comment , never thought about the lack of its own symbolism from the dictatorship . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/order_of_christ_ ( portugal ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/c.f._os_belenenses this cross has none/almost none fascist connotation and is still used to symbolise the age of discovery here . 
  good luck with that , it got a lot worst in portugal in all this years of eu ( not that eu is to blame ) , with lisbon getting bigger and bigger, 
  apparently there are also lots of gun nuts on r/europe judging by this post . 
  makes sense because reddit is full of them , sadly, 
  i know portuguese , english a bit of french and spanish and i got nothing . 
  most people not coming from a germanic language and only learning english do n't get german , especially since english has lots of fresh influence . 
  its scary the steps hungary has take in the direction of a non-democratic country . 
  yes they still have elections but it looks like it would be imposible to get this guys from power and even if they do to repel some of those laws . 
  most people use inglaterra , but a lot of people are stating to use reino unido , ou gra bretanha . 
  lots of links in this article , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_discoveries some other i found browsing wikipedia of some places , like malacca , etc. 
  did n't meant that way , i 'm no fan of colonialism . 
  theres lots of things in the later part of portuguese empire thats left out , its amazing that is the most talked subject , but theres almost no mensions of the wars with the ottomans in the indic , the conquests and diplomacy in the indic and far east , the wars ( lost most of them ) with the dutch , and so on . 
  basically we just teach the good things , i think the program still borrows heavily from the dictatorship time . 
  do n't make up excuses for our currently fuck up government . 
   the population effectively doubles in the summer thanks to tourists it 's also ( or even mainly ) from emigrants who visit their , families in the summer . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/city_of_london its one of the biggest ( the biggest ? ), 
  financial place in europe , so its kinda of the logical name , for a country full of banks like switzerland, 
  everything you say its mostly true for portugal , ( and more even in spain ) , in the nighties everyone here also thought the same way you did ( me included ) . 
  sorry but the truth is that lots of people are going to get rich ( especially politics and builders ) with this , you are going to increase debt ( because of eu funds , incentive to corruptions and credit booms , etc ) corruption is not going to go way ( it never did here , and its was less than in romania to begin ) , and that new generation bit is just delusional , they are going to be the same , and the ones that are not are going to get far way from there , when things get worst . 
  do n't get me wrong , i want the european project to succeed but the direction its going , it is going to implode very soon . 
  keep telling your self that , portugal was much better than romania a few years back , so do n't wory if things do n't change in the ue your not going to live fine in romania , or in most ue countries . 
  no , but this is not the solution . 
  you could just do the `` normal '' thing , let the banks fail and secure deposits until 100.000 ( thats the law there i think ) , or just tax the 100.000 + ones and tax like 20 % after 500.000 , this way you get `` the mob money '' and do n't fuck over the people . 
  since when do you talk for most portuguese , your just a american libertarian wannabe , so please do n't think even a small percentage of your country supports you , must less the eu . 
  candidate countries at the time . 
  theres a lot of oranges trees here . 
  and in some eastern languages , portugal , also means oranges . 
  we are really just calm and do n't care our inform ourselves and is not that are to be informed . 
  for example the the last prime minister and the current one were linked with corruption or at least favouritism in there careers , and in the normal country they would just step down in that instant . 
  but the people just do n't care , they endure 48 years of a retrograde dictatorship , almost without any meaningful resistance and public demonstration . 
  we are only a democracy because the army all sick of fighting in africa , not because we ( the people ) wanted to fought to bring down the government . 
  that is nice and all , and i kinda agree with most of your plan , but that 's not feasible . 
  politics in the north made sure to use the fact that they do n't want to pay any more to southern countries an issue in internal politics , so no one is going to give the necessary money our they would lose votes . 
  and , in the south this would be seen as a complete lost a sovereignty too the northern countries , wish would be fine if they had the south interest in mind . 
  but current `` bce/ue/fmi '' measures in those countries are demonstrating they are there to guaranty that they pay back the debt at any cost to the economy an d population of those countries . 
  so tell me who is going to agree to your sensible plan ? 
  there 's no trust in the ue any more , for this to be possible . 
  so this law also would not do anything , they would just drive without a licence , since like you said there is no effective controls . 
  this will basically just end up targeting working poor people and do shit for road savety, 
  and everyone complain and we sure are n't going to repeat that mistake , good thing the president came to his senses , and it was n't after a decision that is going to affect the country like brexit . 
  in theory that is true in almost all countries ( that have a parliamentary democracy ) , but in practice the election has a face that is the pm , that is why everywhere else when he quits there are elections . 
  and that is even more strange in case of something as big as this , the public should be able to vote who wants to take care of the process .

  and that is even more strange in case of something as big as this , the public should be able to vote who wants to take care of the process . 
  it 's incredible that the uk does n't have elections after the government quits , and this new pm just takes over , just strange to me . 
  edit : i know technically how it works , but in practice when the pm quits there are elections in the other democracies that i know off , because the face that gave that party it 's majority is gone . 
  fight it , it seems a great idea , but you be giving almost all your country financial sovereignty to eu ( berlin actually ) , so you depend on them , and its much easier to get in that to get out with disastrous consequences . 
  my country need to do a lot of things like devalue the currency , but since it 's not in german interest it does n't happen , if we had our own coin we prob . 
  would n't even be in a crises like this . 
  yep , so much bullshit the eu , it 's just a tool to get rich people on the rich countries to keep getting rich , and fuck all the small countries and also uses `` us vs them '' rhetoric to pass measures on the rich countries to widen the gap between rich and pour . 
  i certainly think like that now , i 'm completely pro an european project , but not this neo liberal shit that the eu have become . 
  clearly you must live in one of the countries that is profiting ( even if it 's short term ) from this terrible arrangement ( or are a deluded neo-liberal ) , here in fucked in the ass by the eu land it 's pretty clear the article is more than correct . 
  all true but the stupid euro leaders and germany will keep blaming the south countries and dragging europe to the ground , so sad how this union ended up as basically a tool in the hands of neo-liberal to force their politics into the small countries . 
  yes we are the children and should be spanked even if we do all that we are told . 
  you are joking but you guys are in the process of being downgraded from the elite of the eu . 
  that german help has been great for us also / s, 
  i 'm not saying it should be public but it should be there as a last resort . 
  but first we need better negotiators and we need urgently to form a country block with common grounds to have a better voice . 
  also greece could have worked better if other countries back it up ( not that i was will full agreement with the greek government ) , what our government did at the time was beyond stupid , siding with the same people that are kicking us now , just to be a good student . 
  a lot good that did us . 
  no i do n't since i ca n't vote in germany ( and other countries ) elections and their government ( s ) are the ones deciding this in their benefit ( at least they think it 's to their benefit , but it 's a stupid policy in the long run ) or for local populist reasons . 
  you are the won that is advocating doing nothing , or just vote better . 
  i 'm defending that the government has to grow balls and tell the eu no \u00e9 many things , it has to have bilateral talks with similar countries to have a joint voice , and it need to not be afraid to veto stuff and make treats , since is the only language this people speak . 
  it also needs to seen if the eurozone gets reformed soon , otherwise we need a plan to leave it before we are completely pour just to make german rich , this last one is no easy but should at least be on the table and used as leverage . 
  big change that will give since my country has like 0 say even if it had a government that wanted that . 
  actually it kinda has a government like , but apparently the eu wants to take it down with measures like this . 
  so sorry , but you are beeing incredible naive , southern contries are getting explored and given out government powers without nothing in return to unelected people or other governments , and this has been going on for at least 5 years and even with all the push back they are still on the path . 
  if you think this will change within the system , you are wrong . 
  all our contries have been stupid from the start , not to band together and say no this this new german imperialism . 
  explain how i change the eu government , than you might have a point . 
  i 'm still pro europe integration , but not this eu anymore , they are a bunch of know nothing idiots . 
  so it empowers the parties that want to change something that do n't see anything bad with it . 
  that was pretty obvious , the change in talk by the eu . 
  even the talk about another bail out , it was never talked about before they want coelho back , since the guy is a push over like dur\u00e3o 2.0 and is already dreaming of a bank job like him . 
  i 've know that from the beginning , but the stupid politics did n't care , they even made a point of beeing diferent from greece , instead of making a common front , than spain did the same with us , now will probably italy and france . 
  they played right into the divide and conquer policy of the other countries . 
  we were shiting on greece when could be building bridges , same for ireland in relation to the southern countries , then spain did n't back us up , and ended the same , italy next , and now it will be france maybe . 
  divide and conquer , oldest trick in the book . 
  you are correct , i 'm pro an european project , i 'm definitely not pro this current eu . 
  and it was single digit over here and in spain , do n't see it staying like that for long . 
  that is my point . 
  no i think the eu need to go back to helping each other , and not being used by local politics populist rhetorics . 
  i want a united europe , that works together to improve all countries .

   that city likely wo n't attract young people for more than a vacation or holiday party . 
  amen . 
  please . 
  thanks for explaining , i get it . 
  from portugal , another historical poor country , saying profuse thanks , or maybe christmas presents to anybody you feel indebted for is not unusual . 
  and emotional blackmail , or presenting reasons ( sorry i was speeding , i really needed a bathroom ! ), 
  for any request to bend rules and usually it works . 
  but apparently at a different level - and a surprisingly large number of people from richer countries seem to think bribing , which they would never try in their own countries , might be ok . 
  maybe with time it will became less usual , or at least more condemnable . 
  the problem with paying extra for extra things is you might be getting them over somebody poorer who can not pay such , and as such , it is unfair . 
  and , ok this might be a particular portuguese mindset , just not polite . 
  it \u00b4 s pretty incredible . 
  people doing it and admitting it without qualms . 
  i think the admitting is even more shocking , using some subtle interests is one thing , admitting to paying for a bribe , it \u00b4 s really wow . 
  it \u00b4 s not even about legalities , or ethics , it \u00b4 s about using money to buy something you want over other people , taking advantage , like jumping a queue , it \u00b4 s just really really crass . 
  not even pretending to be polite . 
   how she gave a bribe for her son not to go into that class . 
  wow . 
   we need to get some flag/symbol from the roman times for the union roman ?!? 
  roman ?!? 
  in minho or galicia , roman is the new , intruder stuff !, 
  i have few times in my life heardsuch a sneer as i once heard in the voice of a guide in a citania '' ignore that , that is roman and recent '' , and it was not the only time . 
  2143 i don \u00b4 t have much fear of it not existing , portugal is portugal , desenrascan\u00e7o is not to be underestimated . 
  some other countries might be equally likely to survive as they are , denmark noticeably ( who must have already celebrated the 1000th or being close ) , switzerland ... 
  we should start thinking about 2043 and what we should do about it . 
  1943 was no fun , people were having a war back then and even here well not so nice . 
  1843 not sure what was done , and not nice times either . 
  radical idea , get some of that debt paid off till then . 
  think about building some sea barriers maybe . 
  salazar had many flaws but ( and i can \u00b4 t believe i am starting a sentence like this ) he managed to consistently dislike and distrust both franco and hitler . 
  not that he let that get into the way of any mutually beneficial agreements , but like franco he did not . 
  and i think it was reciprocal , each was the other \u00b4 s most despised type . 
  and it \u00b4 s not like everybody did not know about the hendaye deal . 
  that was not the old flag . 
  that was the second newest flag . 
  pfh . 
  yeah , absolutely we are all over 80 years at least . 
  just us and the seagulls . 
  and they cut the electricity 2 months ago for lack of payment . 
  and the weather is bad , bad . 
  it \u00b4 s not actually that cheap , not when compared to eastern europe . 
  just did a ctrl + f on this thread and what a relief . 
  look east . 
  if it exists , it \u00b4 s in eastern europe for sure . 
  east . 
  nothing here , move along , move along . 
   so salazar time is counted as republic time ? 
  well , he wasn \u00b4 t a monarch , so yes , it was a republic . 
  it was the * second * republic ( or `` the other lady '' ) . 
  after the revolution we call our republic , the third republic . 
   i do n't see why the two are connected . 
  why would i find it more-compelling to leave if my wages are cut via inflation versus via having to change jobs ? 
  because one thing affects all and everybody , including the more skillfull , while unemployment is targeted and will affect mostly the less skilled . 
  and if you got to have emigration , it \u00b4 s better it is from the less skilled and alreadty unemployed or unemployable rather than the skilled and necessary . 
   the issue that people will leave for germany given freedom of labor is , it seems to me , a broader issue , and unrelated to the one of currency choice . 
  in economics very little is unrelated !, 
  and no , your reply in no way answers . 
  devaluing currency with free circulation of people and capital seems like an extremely bad idea , particularly when there are no guarantees it would solve a trade inbalance since exports are mostly transformative and there is little room for instant increases in industry capacity . 
  leaving the euro is not the same thing as time travelling back in time so it was not joined in the first place . 
  live by the sword , die by the sword . 
  what he did to seguro can be done , and with a lot more justification to him . 
  and presidentials are coming , and two candidates and isn \u00b4 t that going to be a lovely mess . 
  i think it will be good for ps on the long , or even medium , term , to clean up house really well and get rid of the connotations of socratism , of dinosaur attitudes ... 
  when last week he had the nerve to explicitly invite seguro to walk down chiado with him , i * knew * this guy was not going to be prime minister , no way . 
  so , the weather and the football in the end didn \u00b4 t matter for the abstention . 
  or maybe the effect of jos\u00e9 s\u00f3crates going voting live on the lunchtime news ( of course he would , of course he would ) made enough people go out and vote to more than balance that . 
  and if there are any seguro sightings tonight let me know . 
  now that is somebody who is going to have a great night . 
   how many of the parties running are full of arse-holes ? 
  being portuguese , we obviously consider about all politicians are arseholes ( or perhaps naive innocent souls too delicate for politics and to be in power ) . 
  so all of them . 
  some might be worse than others , in different or more serious ways . 
  and they are in all parties . 
  in a country which has problems with desertification of the interior , that also has problems . 
  at least as currently is , with large parties taking care to nominate mostly local candidates , at least it \u00b4 s a chance for the lesser populated areas to be at least represented . 
  sometimes for their advantage , remember the limiano cheese factory ? 
  there are no ideal methods . 
  all got drawbacks . 
  i have asked this before , many times , and nobody has ever explained to me . 
  in a market with free circulation of people and goods , assuming changing to a new currency will lead to its inevitable devaluation , what do you think it would happen to emigration ? 
  how to keep doctors and nurses and masons if their salaries go down and they can move anywhere else in the eu ? 
  also not sure if our industry is of the kind which can scale up production to take advantage of a week currency , because a lot of it is transformative and would still need to import materials in a weak currency , while having a lot of trouble planning adequately expansion in a free moving currency . 
   how about investing in national production , i think some was invested , and not unwisely , some industries seem to be picking up . 
  in what other fields , or what specific investments , do you think deserve special attention ? 
  do you think the corporate tax rate should be lowered ? 
  i was thinking mostrou of spain admittedly . 
  but if you look at the portuguese and greek revolutions and dictatorships you will see already very different patterns . 
  what surprises me is that portugal is not seeing a podemos and ciudadanos kind of parties , like they are and have surged in greece , italy and spain . 
  i think we are naturally , have been for a while , too cynical to take these type of parties seriously . 
  also we have had a real life , effective , revolution in our recent , living memory . 
  yeah , shocking isn \u00b4 t it ? 
  liking trees over bare erosion marked land ... 
  trees . 
  so kinky , isn \u00b4 t it ? 
  btw more seriously now , iceland reminds me inevitably of the azores , same mid atlantic ridge volcanic islands , just a little further down . 
  where there are trees , though low , close hugging kind of tree ( not all trees are really high , in fact in windy areas , close growing is far more common ) . 
  the scale is a little different , 9 small islands rather than a large one , but seriously i do not think it suffers in comparison because of vegetation . 
  they are all , mid atlantic ridge islands extremely beautiful . 
  really tall trees to hide that crater though from the river side . 
  actually trees high enough to hide that crater might be even more interesting than that view , i certainly would find them so .
