  are you sure that is what you want ? 
  it is , strictly speaking , a democracy . 
  despite all the cards beings stacked in the background through shady methods . 
  it 's the new pattern of `` illiberal democracy '' , staying just above the technical criteria of being a one party state , but never putting yourself at risk of giving up power . 
  and it 's working , many are taking these democracies as models of national sovereignty ... like they did back in the 1930s . 
   i ca n't believe how this guy is sucking up to erdogan , especially after he called fellow eu member states nazi 's and fascists . 
  people like putin , erdogan , orban etc only respect and endear themselves to people that can hurt them . 
  that 's why putin and erdogan de-escalated just after the jet crash and just short of a armenia-azerbaijan proxy war and are now close partners . 
  erdogan can win or loose orban 's election depending on if , when and how he opens the tap on the migrant issue . 
  they call w. europe and the eu nazis and fascists exactly because they can knowing that nothing will be done to them , they can say anything and they 'll still get money as long as they play the victim . 
  it 's master-slave mentality , where they see only power relationships , not any sort of fraternity of values . 
  what berlusconi says and what berlusconi thinks are worlds apart . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.miniszterelnok.hu/prime-minister-viktor-orbans-speech-at-the-turkish-hungarian-business-forum/ ) is the speech he gave at the meeting . 
   hungary 's standing up for turkey is not a one-off event , but the result of a strategy . 
  hungary is a conservative country which prioritises enduring human values . 
  money is , of course , important , and it 's good to have more of it than less . 
  business is important , and it 's good to realise that you have a stable footing , that you have a safe background . 
  but hungarians do not believe that business and money are the most important things in the world : it 's more important to have friends . 
  and if you have friends , you are also bound by obligations : you stand by your friends , even though sometimes it might be uncomfortable . 
  you can therefore rest assured that whatever anti-turkish statements are heard in major european countries , hungary will never add its voice to them . 
  this is because hungary is on the turkish people 's side , and we believe that we europeans should look at turkey in the context of its imminent status as europe 's largest country . 
  turkey is situated on the edge of europe , protecting the continent 's interior . 
  if you were not doing your duty , europe would have been flooded by millions of migrants -- who it would not have known what to do with . 
  today turkey is protecting europe , and it deserves respect and recognition for this . 
  for our part , we shall always accord you that respect . 
  not really . 
  israel has been part of the same conservative strong man brigade as turkey 's erdogan and hungary 's orban for a while now , under netanyahu . 
  if you 've seen orban 's latest trip to turkey , you notice that they 're all very chummy with each other , despite expectations . 
  or , you know , someone who speaks something else than english . 
  i am hoping , really hoping that the hungarian and polish government made an agreement that hungary can suck up to russia the moment poland gets lng promises from trump , and their both sort of coordinating their finlandization . 
  i have to , otherwise there is no hope for the region as anything else but an insane asylum . 
   no , i wouldnt like eu to stop germany . 
  i would like germany itself to recognize the problem . 
  and yes , they block the prospects of polish ports and german ( or even eu , of course germany dominated ) courts have decided that its not illegal . 
  but it 's not a problem is it ? 
  at least , not for germany . 
  germany in fact gets cheaper gas as a result . 
  so you have poland , telling germany what to do , for the good of poland . 
  welcome to the world of `` muh soverengty '' . 
  where every country only cares about itself . 
  even hungary has now made a deal with russia . 
  welcome to the mentality you yourself are promoting , and have been promoting on this board for months . 
   you misunderstand . 
  we dont trust anyone to protect us . 
  we believe russia has to consider all options and that the fact itself keeps us safe for now . 
  also , we prefer the us gas over the russian , for obvious political reasons . 
  and if the us sells you out ? 
  what if this newfound friendship is just a way to get concession from russia in the me and next year you see a massive pull back as your defense is traded away again ? 
  this is pawn-thinking , but safe today does not mean safe tomorrow . 
  i really do n't approve of it . 
   no one is respecting european military and european will to fight . 
  those are important political assets . 
  but we can change that . 
  that , unlike america 's interest , is completely in our power . 
  we are literally giving up control for the sake of a gamble over what america wants . 
   my beef with the norstream is that it limits the tonnage of ships that can sail into developing polish ports . 
  its clearly the dishonest competition from german side . 
  do you want poland to stay quiet about the clear injustice for political reasons ? 
  i would really like to see a reference to that tonnage limit , because that would genuinely be illegal . 
  that being said , i think you 'd know by now i want ns stopped . 
   but if we talk about political reasons i think you dont understand that its more than `` tying germany to russia '' . 
  the ability to stop flow of gas to ukraine without disrupting the flow to the west practically pushes the ukraine into russian hands . 
  they can blackmail them into anything now . 
  just so you know . 
  why are you acting like i do n't want ns2 stopped ? 
  and i asked you a question !, 
  do you want the eu to stop germany over this ? 
  i do , i believe it should , but you ca n't seem to give an answer and the polish government definitely fears having the eu tell nations what they should or should n't do . 
  when germany says `` muh sovereignty '' over it 's energy supplies , how is that any different than poland about ... most of everything these days ? 
   change that first and we can discuss this again . 
  poland and the uk literally blocked the new eu military mission center because it had the word `` headquarters '' in it . 
  so changing our military ability is proving a bit of a hassle from certain quarters . 
   as long as we have common interest with usa , america will protect us from russian influence . 
  and thats all we really need . 
  see you next western betrayal brother . 
  apparently you never learn , like a perpetual abuse victim . 
   and nordstreams show how `` relatively equal '' eu is . 
  i 'm going to be blunt . 
  do you want the eu to shut down nord stream for political reasons ? 
  do you want the eu to cut down german sovereignty over it 's energy deals ? 
  i want to hear a clear yes or no . 
  because let 's be honest , poland wants ns2 so germany is n't tied to russia , not because of any direct damage and that sort of reasoning is valid , but it implies national sovereignty is less important than political implication for the union . 
   as for the `` integrated eu '' , eu itself is usa vassal , at least in military sense . 
  only as long as we keep allowing it , we can always change that . 
   trump attending the intermarium summit today shows that alliance with usa is not exclusive with the idea . 
  it absolutely is , as has been seen regarding discussion about eu integration `` competing '' with nato . 
  right now the intermarium is a side-show he can amuse himself with , get serious and watch the critics come out of the woodwork asking us to be better nato members and stop the silliness . 
  america will always be critical of anything that looks like it 's getting to independent . 
  it 's just eastern european skepticism . 
  you do n't need a source , it all insight and political pessimism . 
  even when wrong , it 's useful . 
  unfortunately , in this case , it 's has a spoonful of ignorance thrown in since the user does n't ken what `` single market '' means . 
  intermarium or integrated eu . 
  you know alliances between relative equals . 
   the choice is between being a russian or american vassal . 
  we tried both options . 
  those are n't the only options , but honestly i 'm not surprised those are the options you give yourselves . 
  german and french workers ? 
  you think it 's just german and french workers in their defense industry ? 
  those are our jobs as well being given away .

  now i do n't have nothing against them being gay , but i do have something against stupid people . 
  if u gay , refugee camp should be the last place you should go . 
  and , if you do end up there for whatever reason , then do n't do gay things . 
  simple , darwinian shit . 
  when you in a place where most people kill gays and u gay , do n't be gay !, 
  he will also have less purchasing power while living in poland . 
  there is no way back now . 
  it 's not like you can just send most migrants back , especially with these socialists in power . 
  you just have to cut your losses and stop accepting more . 
  but ... finland is smart , it 's not a fair comparison . 
  we invest in huge churches instead . 
  wonder how that will pan out . 
  what do you have to do to become a saint in estonia ? 
  can i pls ? 
  i do n't know man ... 
  it 's not really a thing to be proud of . 
  it 's like competing for 1st spot in who 's more backwards . 
  i was worried we 'd have no competition with our outrageous cathedral so ... thanks ? 
  we have the highest percentage of religious people in europe , like 90 % + . 
  and we are obviously very well off , pretty fuckin rich , and you know when everything else kind of works you just start building these things . 
  cause why not ? 
  not sure if joking or not , i assume it 's both serious and joking to some extent but i 've been to berlin and it 's not that bad . 
  it 's pretty ugly as a city , but the people and life i liked . 
  i spoke to a german guy who said he likes berlin cause police wo n't give you shit for smoking weed on the street , as opposed to munchen which was portrayed as a city full of rich bastards . 
  are you from munchen ? 
  welcome to ... the whole world ? 
  i believe that 's the story everywhere more or less . 
  variance in the price of imported products is very small across countries ( in europe at least ) in my experience . 
  there may be some extreme cases , like norway from what i 've heard where a car costs 3x what it would cost in germany or something of the sort . 
  but if we 're talking a bar of snickers , prices wo n't vary much from eastern europe to germany or uk . 
  so everyone has western prices except for services . 
  well , if people take those jobs then it means they had worse options/no options to begin with . 
  what would you prefer , starving to death or being underpaid compared to a german worker ? 
  alas , it 's a sad reality in poorer countries . 
  nobody forces anyone to take those jobs , and people who do take them probably do n't have better alternatives . 
  what 's the difference between civil unions and marriage ? 
  this is why the eu should n't have expanded so aggressively . 
  if you 're going to have freedom of movement and workforce with member countries so drastically different in wages and wealth , then obviously some things are going to be fucked up . 
  it 's not the irish workers ' fault that they 're replaced by a cheaper workforce and obviously people from eastern europe do n't sleep in a house together with other people because they like it . 
  and yet they 're to blame ... 
   until a small minority of muslims stop taking the retarded and violent ~ ~ passages of the ~ ~ koran literally . 
  man , everyone laughing at trump but you do n't see no muslims blowing themselves up in the states every day . 
  and then you complain that this happen here . 
  well guess what , that 's what dem left wing pc politics do fo ' you !, 
  why do i have a feeling that polls about these kinds of things are inaccurate ? 
  not for this subreddit . 
  i would bet most readers here do n't even know the context or have to look it up because , and you might want to sit down for this , romania is n't the center of the universe . 
  but ... why on / r/europe ? 
  seems to me that like 20 % of posts here are about romania . 
  stop posting every little detail please . 
  i did n't say this affected me personally . 
  i was talking about the situation in 1st world countries not romania . 
  by the way , this is one of the benefits of living in a shitty country . 
  nobody gives a shit about it so they have no interest in blowing themselves up here . 
  i agree . 
  most of them are not blowing themselves up of course , but in life you always have to compromise . 
  not to mention they do n't really integrate or want to anyway . 
  sometimes you just got ta see the pattern , evaluate the risk and make a decision . 
  until that day comes enjoy living in fear while priding yourself with your political correctness . 
  i think sometimes you just got ta step back and stop overthinking it . 
  he sees muslims are a problem and he tries to stop or at least restrict muslim immigration . 
  he may seem retarded in a lot of things that he does , but his straightforward , simple and non-politically correct mentality is just what 's needed sometimes . 
  nordics should be pretty happy . 
  it 's not every day they have the same color in a statistics map as us . 
  just curious , which cee countries ? 
  had 0 problems in the ones i 've been to . 
  did she order it in german ? 
  i think young people hate russia , because it and all of it 's ideologies are stupid . 
  everything russia touches/touched turns to shit -  see eastern europe . 
  old people love russia because they think communism was better . 
  old people are wrong . 
  it 's the same in all of eastern europe i 'd say . 
  the discrepancy between programmer wages and the rest is pretty big . 
  i know a lot of romanians in it who do n't emigrate because they wo n't be able to afford the same lifestyle in a richer country . 
  you are right , confirmation bias is always present in these things and i am pretty sure my opinion is influenced by it . 
  and my sources are mainly news websites and personal opinions of myself and friends who either went to western european countries who deal with these problems or live there . 
   how can you know who will integrate or not ? 
  why make blanket judgement on everyone who arrive instead of making judgement for every individual ? 
  well , statistics and experience can give you some insights into that . 
  and the simple fact is that a lot of muslims do n't integrate in europe . 
  they come here and try to live like they lived back home . 
  all mostly due to ~ ~ their retarded religion ~ ~ islam . 
  every religion is retarded , but islam seems to be just one step beyond the others . 
  35m2 , live alone . 
  before i lived in a 52m2 apartment , also alone . 
  i do n't mind the size as much as i hate renting a place ( the other place i own ) . 
  owning the place is much less of a headache . 
  there was this austrian painter that said northerners are better than southerners but i do n't know how much truth there is in that . 
  another theory is that colder weather makes people think more clearly or something , than very hot weather which just makes you crazy and promotes laziness . 
  there 's also a theory that northerners had more resources thus better circumstances but this does n't seem to be consistent . 
  there 's countries like russia which have resources but are still shit so ... maybe that austrian painter was right after all . 
  in bucharest it 's generally too hot . 
  lately it feels more like 2 seasons instead of 1 , spring and autumn being basically summer for the most part . 
  and summer is waaaay too hot . 
  i also hate that the temperature seems to change more abruptly lately . 
  it sounds kind of like a kid 's language to me as well because to my ears almost every noun sounds like a diminutive for something or words that kids would use but adults not so much . 
  what ? 
  location matters . 
  in zurich or norway i think you 'd be piss poor making 2.5 k , in other places you 're upper middle class . 
  i think bratislava qualifies as the latter .

  why do people hate pineapple pizza so much ? 
  i 've tried that stuff and it 's actually pretty good , very refreshing .

  `` you look pretty white for a romanian ! '', 
  well technically your own government admitted that in 1995 . 
  you could say that about a lot of sports in romania . 
  football , tennis , handball , gymnastics etc. 
  it 's one of the few areas where the communist regime actually did better than what came after . 
  *** ~ futi , nu futi , vremea pulii trece . ~ *** ( whether you fuck or not , the time of the dick shall pass . ), 
  what, 
  as much as i despise abusive law enforcement , whenever i hear about stuff like this i just wish someone would go in and beat the living shit out of those rioters . 
  it 's absolutely pathetic that we got to a point where riots are almost regularly in the news , and because of almost any conceivable reason . 
  trump gets inaugurated ? 
  let 's vandalize storefronts in dc !, 
  government tries to decriminalize corruption ? 
  better throw rocks and ice at police that have nothing to do with it . 
  some guy allegedly commits police brutality ? 
  might as well set fire to cars on the streets and put a kid 's life in danger , that 'll show them !, 
  i 'm sure the police will be extra gentle next time thanks to these losers . 
  but kovesi is one of the `` liberal oppressors '' according to our current government . 
  i dunno about you , but i hear about the male or female gender all the time . 
  the list seems absurdly arbitrary iyam, 
  that was hardly `` the last time '' that happened . 
  try more like last week lol, 
  people thought china would collapse without democratic reforms , yet it 's now the world 's largest economy and it 's only getting more authoritarian . 
  okay , i get what most of those things are supposed to be , but `` gender-gifted '' ? 
  what do these even mean ? 
  edit : i also like how they somehow managed to include all these terms but forgot `` male '' and `` female . '', 
  really ? 
  did you ask every single one of them and came to that conclusion ? 
  i still do n't understand how some people think a place where the vast majority of people are non-muslim is a victim of `` islamization . '', 
  does pilat/pyla mean anything in particular , or is it just a name ? 
  my 8 years spent studying french tell me that `` dune du pyla '' means `` dune of pyla . '', 
  your point being ? 
  the people who elected the current government were also a minority . 
  iirc bessarabia was actually less developed than the rest of the country and might have actually dragged gdp/capita downward . 
  me too , my first thought was `` meh that 's probably some urban legend '' but it 's actually true, 
  you can sing the words to the eu anthem, 
  obviously not , but `` mersi '' is one syllable shorter than `` multumesc '' so whenever people can get away with saying it ( which is most of the time ) , they will . 
  after all , speed and efficiency are an integral part of our national character . 
  well of course you would n't say it in polite conversation , but you can definitely use it with people you do n't know . 
  saying `` multumesc '' at the wrong time can seem condescending . 
  romanian `` multumesc '' is semi-formal , most people just say `` mersi '' like in french . 
   futebolo i though calcium was the italian word for that, 
  some of them would . 
  the older generations are n't all as eurosceptic as some people make them out to be . 
  funny , we 've been through foreign occupation and yet we still want to federalize . 
  well yeah but it still means most people did n't vote for psd . 
  so their claim that they represent `` the people '' is bs . 
  lighten up , they 'll be in power for 4 years , not 5 . 
  also , the ~ 50 % they got in the election ( psd+alde ) is n't exactly what i 'd consider a `` wide margin . '', 
  it was more like 70k back then , this protest is way bigger than that one, 
  you do n't have to be right-wing to criticize immigration and islam though . 
  bill maher constantly does it and he 's as left-wing as they get . 
  it 's even got a [ name ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ) actually, 
  russian media spouts obvious lies and propaganda -  `` but western media does the same . '', 
  russia meddles in other countries ' internal affairs -  `` but western countries do the same . '', 
  russian military invades other countries -  `` but western military does the same . '', 
  russian government supports foreign dictatorships -  `` but western governments do the same . '', 
   `` we want to show that russian deputies will not allow the same excesses present in western europe , '' said ruling party politician andrei isayev . 
   he claimed that european children `` inform on their parents '' in order to get their way , which leads to the parents losing custody . 
  of * course * the top youtube comments bitch about there being a hijab-wearing woman in the video . 
  i do n't know why i expected anything else . 
  you 'd be surprised how many educated , urban romanians vote psd . 
  they call themselves social democrats , but ideologically they 're closer to ukip than labour . 
  i 'm more concerned with the ones that do n't get aborted . 
  i mean , teenage pregnancies ( [ which we have lots of ] ( http://www.factcheckni.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/live-births-eu.png ) ) usually lead to poverty or child abandonment . 
  but fuck that , think of the children , ban sex ed !, 
  it 's not dying out , it 's becoming more efficient and automatized . 
  i think it 's got more to do with the fact that romania is still extremely rural compared to other european countries . 
  about 40-45 % of the population still lives outside of cities and towns , and most of those are small farmers so it figures the rate would be very high . 
  still , 28 % is depressing , and i 'm willing to bet much of that reduction came from emigration , not from economic development . 
  that does n't make a lot of sense in the context of trump 's rhetoric though . 
  `` make america great again ! '', 
  `` how ? '', 
  `` stop dominating the world ! '', 
  that 's one of the more unusual comments i 've read lately, 
  christ , at least they have an actual debate about the thing . 
  here the so-called leftist government just shrieked that sexual education `` corrupts the youth '' and that schools should teach abstinence instead . 
  i 'm not making this up . 
  keep in mind he was a pnl member for just a few months . 
  he had nothing to do with the psd-pnl alliance, 
  priest swag . 
  got ta impress the daddy upstairs if you wan na go to heaven . 
  some of those are actually russian but yes , pretty much relevant . 
  fine , so he talked about dreaming children who were made by the same creator . 
  my point stands . 
  btw , i listened to a dubbed speech so i basically had to listen to two people talking at the same time and make sense of what they 're saying . 
  i did n't try to `` twist '' anything . 
   and what i say is backed up by numbers so you 're from the future ? 
  can you give me stock market tips ? 
   unfortunately it seems i hurt your feelings . 
  i do n't care about them dense motherfuckers on the internet . 
  also , `` islam '' is a noun , not an adjective . 
  if you 're gon na play the grammar nazi at least do it right . 
  so you * are * one of them dense motherfuckers . 
  muh euro-superiority complex, 
  we have waaay too much religious bs in our politics as well so i do n't really find it that odd because i 'm used to it . 
  i think it 's mostly for political points though , many politicians pretend they are true believers but i doubt they actually are .

  my serial number indicates i too have been manufactured in romania . 
  my religious views and sexual orientation are standard for my model . 
  more scottish women as the doctor 's companions ? 
  though i doubt any other woman could hold a candle to karen gillan ... 
   i just accept that scotland 's sovereignty 's a matter for the scottish to decide - there 's absolutely no reason for me to hold all that much of an opinion on it . 
  amusingly enough , that 's the very mindset we 've got in romania regarding the reunification with moldova . 
  whoever is offended by it , apparently . 
  hey , why did the chicken cross the road ?

  they were probably the exception -- the rugby players at my highschool were , admittedly , not the brightest of the bunch , but they were all chill dudes . 
  i used to hang out with them sometimes , when skipping classes . 
  to put this in perspective for any american readers -- these guys were a sort of `` jocks '' , while i was one of the `` geeks '' , being in the computer science class and the sort who 'd not pay attention in class due to reading a book . 
  there was never much of a divide between the `` cool '' and `` uncool '' kids , and the lines were drawn very arbitrarily -- stereotypical geeks were seen as cool because they listened to metal and could recommend the best computer games , the `` slick hair and expensive clothes '' crowd tended to play basketball and listen to opera ( no , really ) and the really smart and the knuckledraggers hung out with the filthy rich with no sense of disconnect on any level . 
   it is the strong sense of right and wrong and the idea that everyone should have the ability to live in peace and comfort and not live a life of fear where dying either from bullets or starvation are the options . 
  i 'm not saying that is n't so , but i find that both ironic and amusing , given that until a few hundred years ago , norway was better known for the rampaging berzerkers that 'd kill , rape and pillage anything .

  hence , learn chinese , not danish . 
  i 'm actually far more concerned about the chinese invading european markets than i am about the vikings invading the european mainland ... 
  well , czech , polish , slovak , slovene and bulgarian are all slavic languages , and a good deal of the people in eastern europe ( both in the eu and outside of it ) speak a bit of russian , due to the soviet influence . 
  5 motherfuckin ' languages : 1 . 
  your native language , because you sort of need this one to develop as a sentient . 
  english , because it 's the de facto international language . 
  a romance language . 
  chinese or arabic , because in 20 years , you 're gon na need that . 
  haha , fair point . 
  a huge clusterfuck , imo . 
  i mean , i 'd love to live in an actually united europe ( united sates of europe , as it were ) , but ethnic issues run deep ( think cyprus , on an europe-wide level ) , not to mention i can envision endless bickering on everything ( '' * \\ [ country at the other side of europe \\ ] * ? 
  what the fuck have they ever done for us ? '' ), 
  ftfy, 
  well , the thing is , more economically powerful countries ' opinions might carry more weight , so people in general would listen to what the english , french or germans have to say about the eu , and tend to dismiss countries with smaller economies ( or territory ) , based on the same sound logic that makes people think that more beautiful people are smarter . 
  just sayin ' . 
  it 's much weaker than the uk 's , which was my point . 
   likewise i rarely hear accusations of anti-europeanism aimed at iceland , norway , switzerland , andorra , monaco , san marino or liechtenstein and they are n't even members of the eu !, 
  i guess that 's because their economies are n't as strong as the uk 's . 
  also , you could fit andorra , monaco , san marino and lichtenstein twice over in surrey , and still have some space left , which is probably why most people dismiss them ... 
  i propose a new logo -- the reddit alien riding a bull . 
   transylvania was a part of hungary from 1000 to 1918 , up until the trianon treaty . 
  did n't know that . 
  but i must point out , whenever i was in hungary ( well , budapest ) and there were maps around town ( for instance , the tour dates of a band , with the dates on top of the cities on the map ) , it was greater hungary .

  and when i said history of extremism i meant that from noveber 17 to golden dawn you covered all your ideological basis . 
  we to study mathematics but instead of studying historical world heritage texts we learn exclusively romanian literature ( witch only spans about 150 years , but whatever ) , thanks nationalist propaganda educational system . 
  yeah the first pig death squeal really pulls your heart strings , i was about eight or nine , and the hair was n't even all the way burned when my grandma told me about santa . 
  that was one intense chrismas . 
  tourist ( but i do n't consider that to be a relevant experience ) and a few greek colleagues ( students ) . 
  i appreciate that you 're aware of your country 's problems , most greeks are allergic to self criticism and deflect direct criticism . 
  i do n't want to sound arrogant , we have much bigger problems but like the italians and spaniards we admit them and try to fix them , i do n't really see this happening in greece , because there will always be someone else to blame . 
  the reserved aspect can be explained by the psychological pressure that the communist intelligence services put on 2-3 generations of romanians and the germanic-protestant culture could explain their lack of interest in discussing controversial subjects ( a german said once that talking about religion or politics is the easiest way to not make friends ) but all these theories break down when you see how reserved are italians when it the subject verges on social or political controversy ( not the north vs south kind ) , witch is the more surprising when after a few glasses of wine you feel like a marriage counselor . 
  most of my countrymen are in general reserved when it comes to philosophical/religious/political debates ; at best they support a popular opinion or the general consensus . 
  i found this to be the case with older germans , austrians , southern italians , but not the greeks or serbs and people of bucharest . 
  it 's that personality trait that makes you feel entitled to have a opinion on most subjects and not be afraid/ashamed to speak out . 
  i understand if this may not be a quality for some people but you ca n't have reasonable debates ( that can change your or your counterparts opinion ) with passive closed up people . 
  there are about 2 cities and 2 different castles that are `` dracula 's castle '' . 
  try to be more specific . 
  so the bad parts first : - you have a tax evasion problem - you have relied on toursism as a stable income source for to many years - you have a history of extremist politics - you have a increasingly aggravated drug problem - your police force is the most overpowered this side of the atlantic i honestly do n't resent greece , but you have a lot of structural problems that you do n't seem to want to adress . 
  now the good parts : - i love your cuisine , seriously your food is the most refined in the whole balkan-turkish-slavic part of europe - you have a indignant national pride and sense of self , and makes for great philosophical debates , do you learn philosophy instead of math in school ? 
  - you have some beautiful genetics , seriously , after ukrainian women greeks are right after in the gene pool ( if any women thinks this sentence was sexist ; shut up !, 
  you know you fantasises about a tall , dark , green eye , greek lover ), 
  [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_romania ), 
  if you get the aussies in , i 'm totally for a romaristralian union but our eagle is much more [ shiny ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/coat_of_arms_of_romania.svg ), 
  thank you , westerners are cool to , it 's just they are less used to speak up for themselfs , we also grew up with a lot of things to bitch about so i guess that helped . 
  ps i apologize for my grammar, 
  i ca n't find the eu recommendations on the subject but but based on those , our national veterinary association states that all pigs have to be shot by a special type of bullet , while he is sedated . 
  witch seems to me really a lot of overkill ( no pun intended ) . 
  granted the new regulation does state that before the pig is cut the vet sends some meat to the lab to check for trichinosisso there are good parts . 
  no guns here , communists really found that them inconvenient , the most deadly everyday weapon is a rubber bullet revolver . 
  but hunting rifles can still be found in some well off rural estates . 
  it 's illegal now to stab it , they have to call a vet for the killing part . 
  so apparently it is to vulgar for our european legislators . 
  on the torture side i think the horse racing industry is much more brutal in it 's practices . 
  also from a artificial moral high ground industrial chicken growers have little to no interest in the animals well being , much more than the bull growers in spain . 
  the gore part was for people that do n't like to see guts and skinned heads, 
  [ kinda like this 1.7 on the gore scale ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azynueelx_4 ) but it 's more than that , it 's kinda like thanksgiving . 
  since a whole pig is impractical its generally bought by 2-4 families , and it 's a good opportunity for families to meet before christmas and eat , and drink , and eat . 
  going to the grocery store does n't have that same sense of special occasion . 
  i probably remember it fondly because it always happened right after school ended for the year , but that community slaughtering and the traditional pickleling that happened before in october/november are real traditions , they had a certainty to them , it reassured you that time goes on but some things are constant . 
  the most constant tradition i have is going to the mall after a holiday and watching a pixar movie . 
  i think it 's more of a tourist attraction rather then a culturally relevant tradition . 
  i personally like communal pig slaughtering , which is our '' `` national barberism '' and am kinda sad it 's going away because of all the negativity animal activists put on the subject . 
  the way i see it it 's not a european issue . 
  when and if the local community will get tired of it , it 's their job to eventually ban it , or switch to robot bulls . 
  i do n't think moldova is under the same risk as ukraine . 
  also , our production only covers 3/4 of our consumption , and as the energy marked is opened up , this coverage will only decrease . 
  i personally see it as a strictly political gesture , with no solid strategy behind it . 
  but maybe i 'm wrong and we will become a energy exporter over the years and as a favor for our neighbors we 'll sell them gas at cost , and maybe they will decide to stop caring about the russian army living in their country and accept our help . 
  considering the large number of russian and economic disparity i do n't think federalism can be avoided, 
  the day we will produce and sell gas at a lower price than the russians will be the day the russians invade us . 
  but it 's a cute political gesture , expensive and useless but cute . 
  rain fall is a local phenomenon with limited ecological effect in this particular case ( the area is pretty small ) . 
  i used the carbon theory as an example of a large sale ecological issues . 
  i do n't know the numbers , but if this is the case , ecological lobbyist should raise the issue with the locals and demand from the government a better clause be introduced . 
  again it 's not the company 's fault that we have incompetent politicians . 
  2 different things : 1 . 
  long term ecological strategies are not settled at a national level , climate change wo n't be solved by national decisions , lets say the whole of europe has the carbon footprint of luxembourg , it would just give the other countries excuses to pollute more . 
  also , this is not a relevant environmental issue like , for example : if we could tax the us and chinese industries to such an extent that we would post pone global warming by 200 years , but most likely due to the new cost of industry the global economy would at best stagnate for 20 years . 
  now that would be an environmental policy , and as you can see it goes way above our national authority . 
  within international regulations , national government has to look for the best interest of its people , and sometimes this implies environmental policies much stricter than the international ones like in the case of denmark or the netherlands . 
  but in our case , deciding to be eco friendly , to take the high road is detrimental to those people , and we do n't have the right to force them to accept our decision and not have a chance to prosper . 
  again , i do not think this is a good project , and i do not think it will end well , i am just arguing that i do not have the moral right to decide for them . 
  accidents happen , that is what insurance is for . 
  the contracts clauses have to have provisions for that unfortunate event also . 
  but i do not see this as a good enough reason to oppose a theoretically good project . 
  at best i think it 's an argument that the community should take into account when deciding . 
  when there are a large enough number of employees , with large enough salaries , their income can support enough local businesses so they reach a long term stability , see all industrial centers built in the last 30 years in western countries ( post reagan era ) . 
  if the community is to small or salaries are at best average the community ca n't reach a stabile level , and you get a collapsed community ; sites like : otelul rosu or anina , south african gold mines , or amazonian bauxite mines . 
  the success lies in the conditions that the state demands from the investor . 
  fair point in citing the romanian academy , but considering they 're as objective as the average blogger and as less competent on economical subjects than a tabloid journalist i have my doubts . 
  i will argue that there is n't an industrial mining project on the planet that lasted less than 8-10 years , reason being it is so expensive that any low yielding mining project would not start if it would be a long lasting project . 
  and the myth is that this is one of europe 's biggest deposit so it will definitely take a while . 
   i 'm not saying that tourism is a very good solution for the region 's long-term development , but neither is this one . 
  and i am saying there is n't one better , and when you tell a poor community well we thing it 's better for you to not have this big investor start one of the biggest mining projects in europe in your back garden because it 's unhealthy , it 's just pretentious and selfish . 
   the high ecological risks associated with the project , the much too small disaster guarantees offered by the company or the too small profit made by the romanian state compared to other such projects in the world . 
  i totally agree , but it is in no way the fault of the company that our officials have no strategy and no interest in solving complex issues in an environmentally sustainable way . 
   i do n't think this should be an argument . 
  ecology issues need to be addressed on a higher level . 
  maybe local communities would cut away all of romania 's forests for some quick money if they were allowed . 
  that does n't mean they should be . 
  here , we have a problem ( more of a philosophical disagreement ) , i agree some important restrictions and guidelines should be set by the national authorities but they should be subverted if it is in the interest of the local community . 
  it is a text book case of ineffective governance to dictate that people not chop up the forest surrounding their city because somebody in bucharest says it 's not sustainable . 
  nobody in harghita will give a fuck , because all the local community depends on the money they get from deforestation . 
  of course you could tax wood exports , but you would just make the community poorer . 
  you could increase controls , but that would just lead to an increase in corruption . 
  or you could simply say to the local authority ( and people ) : `` it 's your forest , if you do n't guard it you wo n't have it tomorrow and do n't expect the government to pay for a new one . '', 
  from forests to hotels and irrigation systems , this whole centralised ownership idea has only proven that locals do n't care about what the state owns , but they do care about what they own . 
  yes this regional responsibility system has is problems to , but in has the ability to be flexible , in communities where there really is n't any other source of income you give the ability to supervise and tax the exploitation to the local authority , this increases revenue and reduces the present rate of cutting . 
  in communities where there are other economical sources of income , a local authority may decide to enforce restrictions on deforestation and even implement reforestation as a public service policy . 
  well your theory is posible but it leaves the executives vulnerable to the stock owners . 
  i think it will be more along the lines of [ bre-x ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bre-x ) . 
   which would be a pity in my opinion - there will be some local jobs , but only for a few years , and the locals wo n't become much more wealthy ; the area , however , will never be the same . 
  a gold mining operation last for more than 10 years and this is a big mining operation ... now if the contract states that refinement will be done locally , that will require a lot of workers , witch with sufficiently high salaries can boost up a local economy that will develop into a self sufficient community long after the gold is finished ( salaries are key here ) . 
  all modern mining is dangerous , we contemplate about how beautiful the environment is but we ca n't afford to make nature a priority . 
  that beauty like our agricultural potential needs a lot of entrepreneurial activity to actually flourish into a profitable economical sector . 
  at present we only have eco tourism witch is a pretentious way of saying `` tourism with little or no investment '' . 
  all eco tourism is subsistent , and tourism as an industry is unreliable at best . 
  we brag about how untouched our country is , but we spend our money on `` touched '' vacation spots in other countries . 
  now on the enviromental side of the argument , protesting foreign investments is stupid and political . 
  it promotes a spirited fight the man , fight globalisation message , but it keeps us poor and isolated , witch is bad . 
  if you actually want to do something and create change do it the right way ; pressure local politicians , support environmental legislation that works ; non of that bullshit pollution tax and tax exempted solar paneling ; preach to the locals not to city collage students that already support your narrow opinion . 
  i personally am against this project because i am certain it will be done ** wrong ** . 
  but there is a local referendum result and the people that live there want it , so despite my fears ( of political incompetence not cyanide ) it should be done .

  there are openly gay people in bucharest .

  on a serious note , i think that the high number of people leaving the country is starting to become less migration and more of an expat working abroad kind of thing , falling in with the similar european trend .

  i was thinking of something on the lines of an federal legal system , which would prosecute and try the corruption charges that would get dragged for years in the regular legal system .

  i really resent the tone you 're using . 
  as a national of a similar afflicted country , i can tell you that changing the way a corrupt state works is impossible without external pressure . 
  it 's not like i , the common man , want my politicians/judges/state workers to be corrupt , irresponsible and unqualified . 
  yes , i 'd vote for better people if given the chance , but there are _ no _ better people at the moment and it would probably take decades for them to appear , but i would prefer to have an option where a healthier organism takes some better decisions for a while .

  but indeed , i agree with some other people commenting , the questions a a bit leading . 
  why ? 
  i dislike it when people post chart images without providing _ any _ context . 
  if you want an informed discussion , please put a wikipedia link , a chart source , legend ... anything . 
  i do n't see why a technocracy ca n't be at the same time a democracy . 
  eg , allowing the candidature for the ministry of a particular domain only to people that have some sort of degree relevant in that field , then i can vote for these people . 
  very interesting points . 
  thank you . 
  [ edit ] however i do n't know how you link the definition of the \u201e stable population '' ( as given by the nis ) with voting lists , as long as the [ romanian constitution ] ( http://legislatie.resurse-pentru-democratie.org/const_2003.php#036 ) states :  citizens are eligible to vote starting at the age of 18 years , to be by the day of the vote . 
   can not vote people with mental disabilities ... or people under interdiction to vote by a judge decision . 
  [ edit edit ] also it seems unintuitive ( and wrong ) to allow people to vote but have them not count towards the quorum . 
  could you please provide some citation for this ? 
  [ edit ] in retrospect , what you 're saying makes sense somewhat , but i doubt you , as a citizen residing ( legally ) in a different country , will be removed from the voter list . 
  it seems more sensible to be just moved from the voter list of your circumscription to the one at the romanian embassy of your new country of residence . 
  but please provide some links about this thing . 
  afaik the reasons for being removed from the voting lists ( which come from evidenta populatiei ) is losing your status as a romanian citizen or death . 
  did any of these happen to you , or you 're of the opinion that once you leave your country you lose the right to vote ? 
  also ( although i ca n't find a citing source for this right now ) i remember that the venice commission sanctioned passing a referendum law a couple of months before the referendum as being against their rulings , so the eu might have acted in accordance with that .

  something does n't add up here . 
  the issue is that we 're discussing two different things in this thread . 
  the vote in the image for an eu headquarters , and the larger path to a defensive alliance . 
  when we 're discussing a defensive alliance , instead of just the eu headquarters , we see a lot of different opinions . 
  but even then there 's a consensus that the us system of national armies is to be used to allow states to maintain a seperate command structure . 
   in case of an attack on an eu country , adhoc commands are more than enough . 
  heck , ww2 was fought this way . 
  you just have to agree upon procedure beforehand . 
  no , it does n't . 
  it seems like a good idea on paper but it 's a disaster in practice . 
  setting up a new command is a headache of paperwork , communication , compromise and personality clashes . 
  these take time to sort out and time is always the enemy . 
  combine this with the 27 parallel national commands getting involved , as well as the council sticking it 's nose in things and you have `` who is responsible for what '' clusterfuck . 
  i ca n't stress enough how important having a lot of things set up before a stress situation is . 
  and ww2 is not a great example . 
  it in fact showcases how one military regime can completely outflank an alliance . 
  where have i asked that ? 
  when has anyone asked that ? 
  here 's a bbc link on it : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37359196 basically whenever eu member troops are on a joint mission , their activities to be coordinated from a single hq . 
  inside their own states they are under the full command of their respective armed forces . 
  that 's the very definition of the enchanced cooperation everyone wanted , is n't it ? 
   have an army that answers to 28 national governments with each 28 foreign policies . 
  we 've been largely following the us 's lead on every major issue for a long time . 
  whenever we do n't we 're left out in the cold . 
  we either have a single foreign policy , or we have none . 
  that 's the reality of it . 
  let 's approach things a different way . 
  we can both agree that if there ever was a eu army , the states should continue having their own armed forces right ? 
  it 's helps keep the balance of power . 
  and , at least in my opinion , the eu should never have the right to initiate a draft . 
  i consider that a nuclear option that should be reserved . 
  but , considering that , everyone who is part of the eu army should be a volunteer . 
  if they are volunteering for the eu , it 's not your troops . 
  your troops are at home , defending it . 
  it 's the eu volunteers that are seeing action . 
  should the netherlands have a final say in their deployment ? 
  i 'm somewhat at that stage as well . 
  i do n't really know what to say . 
  ahh , post truth-politics . 
  everything is up for negotiation , even the past . 
   in fact , i think he 's a closet federalist . 
  for a closet federalist he 's very keen on devolving powers to the esm and the eurogroup . 
  as well as critical of juncker acting on his political appointment instead of being a good little secretary . 
  he 's also very keen on bending the rules considering his intervention in the spain/portugal budget issue , a month after he pushed the commission to actualing fine them . 
  the man is two-faced swine . 
  so this did n't happen : http://index.hu/belfold/2016/10/28/russian_diplomats_exercised_with_hungarian_cop_killer_s_far-right_gang/ ? 
  which means that you 're in favor of nothing that commits you to anything . 
  which translate to : we like things how they are . 
  this decade has proven we 're not that lucky . 
  and it sort of hurts me to think of another crash on the russian people . 
  i kind of like them . 
  i just wish we could keep their government at a distance . 
   you know the story , `` we were sold '' , that thing is still alive . 
  and the rest of the east understands completely . 
  but if we do n't pull an intermarium now , it 's only a matter of time before we 're sold again . 
   trying the former lost it for us last time , and i do n't want to go down the latter path . 
  would be so easy though . 
  just say that all the money scotland is paying to trident will go to the nhs and then stick that on a bus . 
  or , i do n't know , point out that the uk is run by a party with 36 % of the popular vote and a prime minister which played musical chairs to get her position ... wait , that 's a sensible argument . 
  forget it . 
  trump 101 : just say random stuff and have people talk about what it means . 
  free advertising . 
  there 's always indyref 2 . 
  if the slovakia can get a country running as normal a few years after the biggest socio-economic crash of that century , do n't see why scotland ca n't . 
   i voted to stay in the uk and to leave the eu fwiw . 
  and i ca n't tell you just how below contempt that makes you to me . 
  i 've seen the ugly face of british nationalism , and the independence referendum did n't have any politicians murdered . 
  especially not by the winning side . 
  you 're the pawn of the end of democracy , and you 're blaming everyone else for it . 
  did n't you guys just have a bombing and another guy shooting at police , and both were found to have links to russian officials ? 
  touche . 
  oh please , and the new demagogues do n't do the same thing by presenting their view as irrefutable and absolute . 
  that they do n't insult their opponents . 
  as far as i 'm concerned the left and right are dead . 
  i 'm just seeing the natural evolution of echo-chamber politics , and you 're all alike to me . 
   to an extent , but not enough to replace the us the us has worldwide ambitions , which is extremely costly . 
  we do n't . 
  we just need to maintain security of our borders and everything around them . 
  we just need to outcompete the us in that very limited regional role . 
  something we 're not currently doing . 
   my argument would be that it is up to the countries to decide who they go to war with - it is their citizens who put their lives on the line . 
  but they do n't decide by unanimity either . 
  why does the eu have to have unanimity while member states can just ignore a part of the population ? 
   this is why i love the uk : representatives of the people directly decide whether we go to war . 
  not an unelected unaccountable body ( the commission or council or ecj ) . 
  this is amazing . 
  so according to you : the europarliament is unelected . 
  the commission head elected by europarliament like a primeminister is unelected , the council which is made of elected heads of goverment is unelected . 
  and the ecj is nothing like the uk supreme court . 
   and the british people decided that their needs were not being met by them . 
  i wonder how many countries would decide the same if given the vote ? 
  it was n't about brexit , and now you made it about brexit . 
  leave , go ahead , article 50 . 
  not going to stomach the present mess because a bunch of people ca n't stand to fix it . 
  i 'm so very glad you 're leaving . 
   which is kind of my point : they 're not answering these questions . 
  so the public need to start discussing them so that the right people have to answer . 
  currently they are saying `` trust us '' with no details , no plan , no guarantees that they wont oppress us with this new power . 
  nobody is saying that . 
   trust has to be earned .

  i 'm not the one trying to push the `` remove kebab '' agenda here , and i do n't need to counter-post some other non-sense . 
  if you want to engage in traditional balkan circle jerk over historic crime , fell free . 
  you do n't need to harass me over pointing out the posting of selective facts . 
   it 'd certainly help if the turkish government would just own up to what it did rather than stay in denial for over a 100 years . 
  this is what i do n't understand . 
  why not just blame it all on the ottoman empire ? 
  a detached monarch and an authoritarian elite grasping at the last shreds of control ? 
  so much invested into defending dead men . 
  it 's not less important , it 's not more important . 
  but if you 're going to hold out one example , you might as well hold all of them , and there are a lot . 
  we 've all been in this boiling pot together , nudging each other in the ribs . 
  why single anyone out ? 
   the greeks had no right to invade western anatolia . 
  they started the war . 
  and if you go long enough , you can find non-ending counter-attacks to counter-attacks until you forget why it even started . 
  blood feuds are like that , they self-propel . 
  so do n't point fingers . 
  war is rarely about a right to invade . 
  some asshole wanted more land , power and wealth , and tried to get it . 
  it 's done , it 's history . 
  call it what you will , but it 's not unique . 
  this continent is the mother of all battle-grounds , no shortage of victims . 
   for 2000 years official documents from the roman empire and greek writers have imitated the attic language of plato and the ancient athenians even though the common language was closer to that of the new testament , wrong or right it 's not weird at all that it took 1.5 century for the new born state to decide its official language . 
  but even the `` written language '' did n't have a singular form . 
  so both the spoken and written languages had to undergo parallel standardization , while at the same time trying to be relevant to each other . 
  which is just a silly amount of effort to preserve the mythos of ethnic continuity . 
  and i 'm saying this from the country sort of obsessed with ethnic continuity . 
   language is the most important cultural characteristic . 
  for greek it makes even more sense , it has an immense cultural and historical value and is spoken by relately few people with no immediate linguistic relatives . 
  you 're right . 
  but at some point you have to decide how `` romantic '' do you want to be about it . 
  for example , again , of romanian occasional language reform is done . 
  admitedly , the last one made no real sense . 
  but its done , and corresponds with its use . 
  counter-example : britain . 
  which not only has arbitrary rules about it 's own spelling and grammar , but adopts the spelling and grammar rules of borrowed words , as a point of intellectual self-validation . 
  did they atleast provide an excuse for doing so ? 
  or do they not even need that anymore ? 
  well , everyone went through a period of written and dialect standardization , to some degree or another . 
  and many of them had an element of historic romanticism about them , for example romanian latinized itself more . 
  the greek example is just a wonderfully ideal specimen of how neurotic that standardization was , as contradictions appared between idealist `` purity '' and practical intelligibility in standardization . 
  at the opposite ends are the scandinavian `` languages '' for the 3 different nation-states . 
  maybe i 'm weird , but that 's funny to me . 
  seeing how language is considered such an key point of the ethnocentric ethos . 
   creating filler useless jobs just to stop unemployment is a disaster in the making . 
  i do n't know how you think this will be good for the economy but retraining people , reforming the education system , or loosening certain regulations to increase hiring flexibility is more beneficial . 
  see you 're right . 
  i did n't say it was good for the economy , i just pointed out the social-political aspects it can resolve . 
  but , two point . 
  first , all your other suggestions run into problems : you either do n't know how to reform it , or reforming it is incredibly unpopular . 
  reforming education ? 
  every government everywhere wants to reform education , no one knows what to reform it into . 
  retraining people ? 
  into what , what if they do n't want to ? 
  as for hiring flexiblity , people riot over that . 
  by comparison mandatory conscription is a neat little way of getting your ducks in row with the minimum amount of `` quack '' . 
  now point two . 
  you might actually benefit from having that training program . 
  maybe not now , or tomorrow , but eventually . 
  simply having people around to help with disaster relief in case of flooding is sufficient , as it gives you a large pool of regimented manpower to call upon when needed . 
  i admit , points and counter-points can be made here . 
  in romania , the conscription service was more than a bit depressing , a bit of dedovshchina rubbed off on us . 
   especially the greek language became the key identifier of `` greekness . '', 
  [ hehehe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_language_question ), 
  unfortunately a large part of the left you 're mentioning still think it 's 1970 . 
  which is the reason why that left has lost support , the working class it 's fighting for does n't exist like it used to . 
  the next obvious target for wealth redistribution policies is now the financial and property markets . 
  and that left simply does n't have the intellectual manpower to tackle it , rather preferring to recycle older union-centric talking points . 
  ahh , got it to load . 
  and yup , i see turkish population in what is now dobrogea . 
  which , are now a significant minority together with the former slavic populaton . 
  was n't the early 20th century just a bag of fucking sunshine ? 
  you 're right , it would be the better way of going about it on a socially acceptable level . 
  the issue though is that a lot of the jobs you describe either require some fairly specific training that you require university/technical school education for . 
  or are so basic you 're basically forcing people to become under-paid janitors . 
  not all of them mind you , there 's quite a few for which it would work , but there is a `` saturation point '' past which each extra person becomes a burden you 're trying to find a place for . 
  the army provides an alternative because it 's the pinnacle of `` pointless make work '' . 
  90 % of it is either training physically and mentally for a situation that will likely never show up or doing routine work around the training area . 
  so you can have people looking very busy without actually doing anything , all in the name of `` preparation '' . 
  i know this sound cynically pointless , but it 's sort of has it 's place . 
  one of the oldest complaints in the world , to the point that tribal villages have them , is what to do with all of the idle people ( usually young ) , that are fucking about the village . 
  the map is n't loading for me . 
  looked at the video and the paper . 
  it 's very interesting . 
  i think a lot of issues stem from the fact that a good portion of the visible minorities had a criminal background . 
  basically , the french army picked them up already broken , the same way adoption centers have to educate kids that are already troubled . 
  so , i agree , the military is n't the `` integration vehicle '' that some rather extreme posters here think it is . 
  honestly , i 've seen it be exactly the opposite with people coming out of it either bullied into obedience , or so institutionalized they did n't know what to do with themselves . 
  it 's something that is hard to do right , and easy to fuck up . 
   so a kind of brainwashing campaign ? 
  this is why we should n't let the extremists get close to power . 
  everything becomes an ideological vehicle to them . 
  schools , national broadcasting , social welfare . 
  no exceptions , just disgusting opportunism on their part . 
  like i said , peace time conscription follows different political pressures . 
  it 's not that a western nation needs an army , it 's that it has a few hundred thousand unemployed youth it has no idea what to do with , and who politicians are struggling to justify paying . 
  to give you an example of how this pressure has been translated to a country that has conscription as one of it 's cultural taboos , the uk , benefits for under 24 's are slowly being cut in every way possible . 
  as of this month , if you 're under 21 you no longer get housing support if you 're homeless . 
  should i expect subsequent maps on ethnic migration of germans , hungarians , romanians and other ethnic populations during the early 20th century ? 
  or is this the only one which serves your purpose ?

  maybe they 're just following intelligence leads . 
  it 's not like islamic extremism is evenly distributed among ethnic groups . 
  and germany is the schoolmaster ? 
  great . 
  now people will be run over by trains under the sea . 
  hungary 's wall worked pretty well without shooting people . 
  it 's definitely possible to guard borders if the political will is there . 
  sea borders are harder to police effectively , but still possible . 
  crossing borders is simply not a human right . 
  all countries impose significant restrictions . 
   if the financial crutches ( provided by the eu ) that currently prop up ukraine are n't enough to keep the country alive then everything goes to shit in eastern europe as well . 
  not really . 
  a new election might bring a pro-russian government , or maybe the civil war would fire up again . 
  the latter is unlikely , semi-frozen conflicts serve russia just fine . 
   what would happen if lukashenka died tomorrow ? 
  somebody from his inner circle would follow him . 
  maybe even a relative , north korean-style . 
  stable dictatorships can handle succession . 
  democracy only extend to citizens , not foreigners . 
  and maybe you should mind your own fucking business . 
  yes . 
  life sucks in romania for a lot of people . 
  but that 's not relevant to policing swedish streets . 
  maybe you should complain to your mayor or something ? 
  it actually means turkey . 
   it 's a positive thing you can just pass through germany without having to identify and register yourself . 
  fine . 
  my point is that denmark should just reject all asylum seekers crossing the southern border and tell them to apply in germany instead . 
   the police wo n't do anything . 
  100 % not our problem . 
  this is an extremely `` romanian '' thing to do . 
  this is extremely dubious mostly because turning the eu away from neoliberalism would be next to impossible . 
  i do n't think varoufakis is sufficiently delusional to attempt this . 
  yes . 
  germany is a very big part of the problem and should deal with the consequences . 
  again , what happens in sweden is not our problem . 
  do n't you have laws and police ? 
  but as far as i can tell this started by * sweden * implementing checks on the border with denmark . 
  denmark is now doing the same on it 's border with * germany * . 
  i 'm suddenly happy that romania is not in schengen . 
  you invited this problem , you deal with it . 
  it has only just begun . 
  it will get much worse , and then probably worse after that . 
   so it 's not to curb the amount of asylum seekers in denmark per se , it 's to avoid illegals gathering in denmark because they are not allowed to go to sweden because of their new border policy . 
  so what is the policy ? 
  prove the right to pass through denmark , apply for asylum at the border or turn back ? 
  honestly this whole mess is caused by the eu allowing unrestricted asylum shopping . 
  germany is one of the most stable and prosperous countries in the world , it should n't be possible to just pass through it and apply somewhere else . 
  the sane policy would be to only allow applying for asylum when passing directly from a country at war . 
  that 's basically the same as paying greece to keep the refugees . 
  this is what the eu is attempting to do with turkey . 
  but it ca n't really work . 
  these people do n't want to stay in turkey and they wo n't want to stay in greece . 
  they want to go to countries like germany and there is no political will to stop them . 
   varoufakis will be attending the february 9 event to introduce diem25 `` with ` collaborators ' from across europe to present concrete ideas on how to democratize europe and how to avoid its creeping fragmentation . '', 
  i guess he likes building suspense ? 
   the ex-parliamentarian says the eu is undemocratic , and that transparency is needed . 
  it would be nice to have some serious criticism of the eu from the left . 
  have you ever noticed that on various news sites ( ny times , guardian ) some articles have a comment section and others do n't ? 
  why is that ? 
  also , why is this in the `` middle east '' section ? 
  it 's about french people doing french things in france . 
   new year fireworks and festivities have been cancelled in the belgian capital , brussels , because of a terror alert . 
  wait . 
  you mean like all of them ? 
   brussels mayor yvan mayeur told state broadcaster rtbf : `` together with the interior minister , we 've decided to not have the celebrations on thursday evening . '', 
  seriously ? 
  can somebody confirm how this actually looks like on the ground ? 
  this is from 2010 . 
   you have a problem for a setup that has n't even been voted on let alone exist yet ? 
  yes . 
  people are discussing yet-unrealized proposals in this very thread . 
   you think the fact that the netherland 's borders is controlled by countries such as hungary and greece fair and `` protects national sovereignty '' ? 
  how is the current setup any more fair than having a unified border force which no one country controls , and we all have a vote in ? 
  you 're referring to the schengen area , but even so greece is not actually connected by land to it . 
  what if after voting the decision is made that hungary must dismantle it 's border fence to create a migration corridor this new patrol force steps in to do it ? 
  this would be clear violation of hungarian sovereignty . 
  but going against the will of a target country seems to be explicitly allowed . 
  from the article :  the new european border and coast guard agency would have the power to intervene `` in urgent situations '' if it believes countries are failing to guard their external frontiers effectively . 
  while this new border control force is not particularly aimed at hungary various eu treaties have been interpreted in surprising ways before . 
  as i 've stated before : the eu must not be trusted . 
  this is not even a particularly difficult problem to solve . 
  maybe you could just give the target country a veto to all operations . 
   there is no common borders policing policy . 
  the eu has no power there . 
  i 'm referring to [ this proposal ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/frontex-chief-sovereignty-not-a-risk-with-new-eu-border-force-border-control-european-commission/ ) . 
  really ? 
  nato accounts for 70 % of worldwide defense spending . 
  i think that people that say that this is not enough are motivated by anti-americanism more than any legitimate security concern . 
  while some might prefer to avoid relying on cooperation with the us on defense i do n't see how that 's helpful . 
  having fewer allies is hardly a defensive move . 
  on the contrary , peaceful countries should try to be as friendly as possible to everybody . 
  who do we need to conquer ? 
  but catalonia is hardly enslaved . 
  and this is besides the point . 
  the parent poster asked why `` territorial integrity '' is something worth preserving and i gave the honest answer : because most of the time changing borders leads to more violence . 
  this is why it 's popular across the political spectrum . 
  it 's better to reach an accommodation some other way . 
  how about because top-down cultural conversion is morally wrong ? 
   what is this territorial integrity you speak of ?

  are we suppose to misrepresent the reality now ? 
  use https://disconnect.me/, 
  thanks for your message . 
  after doing a bit of quick research i see that the romanian gun also comes as pa md. 
  1997 version that uses 5.56 x45mm nato and a pa md. 
  2000 , an improved version of pa md. 
  this is how it looks . 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/pa_md._2000_on_display_at_bsda_2010.jpg not sure what rails/system this model uses to attach the scope + grenade launcher but it seems to at least partially solve the issues you raised . 
  also i 'm not sure if these last models are mass produced as the website of the main producer only shows the older models ( 7,62 mm and 5,45 mm ) . 
  i went back to the photos and you are right . 
  that is the case for most photos with dry/dead vegetation . 
  however , it might not be the case in settings with fresh grass + mud , such as photo no 2 . 
  well , we produce those , making them for many years now so they 're cheap , reliable and easy to use . 
  we also do n't probably have the skills ( actually money ) to make a completely new one that would have superior characteristics while remaining as cheap and reliable . 
  i personally have n't heard of any debates about replacing the main assault riffle in romania . 
  in any case , is the beryl considerably better than the pa md. 
  honest question . 
  maybe some american lost here can help us with this issue . 
  on 1st issue , do n't push it , you are walking on very thin ice here . 
  :-) on 2nd issue , it would not be a problem , certainly not in the case of romania . 
  we are military allies , you would be welcomed to bring your hardware and do trainings with the romanian army . 
  also a renoir and a few by andy warhol . 
  ahh , the competition of the losers , fighting for the last but one place . 
  i wonder of the new zealanders ( and australians ) know that the turkish president is fearing another invasion from their part . 
  they could , i do n't know , invite him for a drink or something . 
  so this is a story about tax evasion in romania . 
  at the same time there are bits about the anti-corruption work being done ( e.g. 
  the 300 mil . 
  euros to be recuperated that the dna prosecutor talks about ) , which is a different subject . 
  on top of that greece is somehow shoved in , while the article 's photo is from chisinau , the capital of moldova , a third country that the article does n't talk about at all . 
  does n't make any sense . 
  it is indeed ionescu in romanian though we mostly use his francized name as well . 
  i would say that he is famous also outside of france and romania . 
  thanks and sorry for the mistake everyone . 
  i was under the impression that at some point kosovo had also accepted that proposal of exchange of territory but i might have been only impressed by the fact that serbia would have agreed to cede some territory from serbia proper ( presevo valley ) . 
  and i 'm romanian . 
  in conclusion , we need to come up with more famous people . 
  ~ ~ both kosovo and ~ ~ serbia proposed this , ceding north kosovo to serbia in exchange for the albanian-populated presevo valley in serbia , but the big powers ( us , uk etc. ), 
  opposed . 
  so they allow kosovo 's secession mainly on ethnic grounds but not the secession of smaller parts of that region , ~ ~ even when there would be agreement between the two countries ( kosovo and serbia ) ~ ~ . 
  one could criticize a lack of consistency here . 
  i mean , what 's the purpose of the investigation if the prosecutors can just order their arrest , backed by the mob . 
  is this justice ? 
  if they are found guilty , then of course , lock them up , but until then people should calm the fuck down . 
  people are arrested when there is a risk that they will try to change evidence , including the position of witnesses . 
  in the case of sova that is a very clear reasons as the prosecutors have shown that he has destroyed several pcs ( hard-drives ) with evidence . 
  without transylvania or the ukrainian parts though . 
  oh , yes it could . 
  russia has done much more unreasonable things than responding to one of its planes being shot down . 
  none of the two parties ( or 3,4 if you count the neutral swedes and fins ) will shot down planes because the risks attached to that are too big . 
  yes , it 's beautiful but this is like the 20th time i see this on reddit . 
  thanks !, 
  nice map , though probably not a neutral choice of colors . 
  would like to see a similar one according to the 2011 census and maybe for the whole country . 
  this is nonsense . 
  tap water in romania is better than the tap water i drink in some parts of western europe . 
  the `` we '' above was meant to mean `` we , in romania '' . 
  afaik , tatars in romania are bilingual , they speak both tatar and romanian . 
  sure , but that has n't stopped them to want to control other countries . 
  this is not about controlling natural resources such as coal . 
  you are right , i was thinking about the same thing when i first saw the chart , thinking specifically about finland . 
  what a crappy and arrogant comment.you should be kept on a leash . 
  it 's great news because russia 's already very small leverage on romania 's energy sector will pretty much disappear . 
  it 's also good news because it shows countries in the region that they too can reduce dependence on russian imports . 
  most romanians do n't give a damn that russia is in a financial crisis . 
  that way they will have less money to invest in their army and will be thus less willing or capable to invade other countries . 
  yes , negotiations involve carrots and sticks but not this kind of stiks in this case . 
  neither ukraine , nor moldova , nor romania will impose an economic blockade on transnistria . 
  that would not be constructive , would lead to a serious deterioration of the humanitarian situation there and would likely lead to a russian intervention . 
  it would just not be a smart move and that 's not the intention neither of ukraine nor of romania . 
  what they are currently trying to do is to convince transnistria to join the new dcfta/trade agreement that moldova has negotiated with the eu , which would make transnistrian producers register with the moldovan authorities and allow them to do quality controls on transnistrian products . 
   rest the rest of europe also asks us , for good reason , not to discriminate against them so no , we can not keep ` our ' gypsies . 
  they are free people , free to travel , equal in rights with all the other european citizens . 
  if they engage in anti-social behavior , apply your laws . 
  if you need the cooperation of the romanian authorities/police then ask for the cooperation of the romanian authorities , but do n't ask us to discriminate against our fellow citizens based on ethnic grounds . 
  romania will not stop at the border its gypsy citizens because that would be racist , discriminatory and illegal . 
  would some of you people calm down ? 
  the intention of the two countries is not about restarting the conflict over transnistria or starving transnistria to death or any other such nonsense , but about doing more diplomatic efforts to help solve that conflict . 
  the negotiations are taking place between the government in chisinau and the transnistrian leadership , what the other neighbors ( like ukraine and romania ) can do is help support this dialogue . 
  and this is the message coming from the two presidents . 
  poverty is indeed a problem for many romanians . 
  however , do not think that all , or even the majority , of romanians begging in sweden are there because they do n't have a roof over their head or nothing to eat in romania . 
  most of these people are roma/gypsy , probably most of them coming from romania , but also from other neighboring countries ( bulgaria , slovakia , former yugoslav space etc. ) . 
  parts of the roma minority are quite badly integrated in their home countries and sometimes do n't feel a particular attachment to any of these countries . 
  if begging in sweden brings them more money that doing some subsistence farming , some other shit jobs or actually begging in their home countries , then they will go and beg in sweden . 
  human trafficking networks are also often involved , transporting these people , including children , placing them in begging spots , dividing the territory between different beggars and begging ` gangs ' , getting a share of their earnings etc. . romania should clearly do more for its citizens ( roma or non-roma ) but it 's just not true that they do n't get any support . 
  the kids get benefits , in some situations adults too , education is free and compulsory and often roma parents refuse to keep their kids in school , there are also some positive-discrimination/affirmative action type of measures regarding higher education with separate university places for roma who would otherwise get there in even lower numbers ; and there are a number of other measures regarding the social inclusion of the roma - like a system of health mediators to mediate/help between these communities and the romanian health system , professional trainings etc. . 
  so this is a much more serious and complex issue of social and economic integration of a minority with partially a different culture and different norms that just a story about poverty . 
  that does n't make the situation any less serious , or , at times , unpleasant ( for swedes or romanians ) but i wanted to offer some context . 
  some imports of russian gas were maintained in order to preserve gas pressure in the network . 
  might also have to do with what the contracts with russia require , not sure . 
  then , there is no need to completely stop imports from russia ( unless they are not at an acceptable price ) . 
  romania 's gas resources are limited , would last only for 20-30 more years , so it would make sense to import some gas from russia in order to have romanian gas available for longer and also to use it in case of crisis ( potential cuts in russian supply or other ) . 
  they are in the process to exploit it . 
  what you say about ussr+wwii applies to romanian oil , not to gas . 
  afaik , romania never exported gas to the soviet union but used it locally and also started importing gas from ussr in 1979 . 
  indeed , romania 's oil and gas production has decreased over the last decades , but a lot of energy-hungry industry has closed after 1989 or has become more energy efficient . 
  buildings/housing are also more energy efficient than 20 or 40 years ago =  reduced energy consumption . 
  there is also a very visible increase in the use of renewable energy sources ( mostly wind and solar ) which covers part of the energy needs , where one would have needed to use more gas ( or coal ) . 
  no , they are part of the lipovan orthodox old-rite church http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipovan_orthodox_old-rite_church,

   and the date is just coincidence . 
  lol sure, 
  good, 
  dont worry pol trolls you still have reddit, 
  they arent mandatory lessons, 
   but why do people hold up his opinions ? 
  judging by downvotes and comments it doesnt look like that really it would have been the reverse if he was a supporter tho, 
  quite influencial the kremlin is in central europe, 
  no wonder the kremlin backs trump, 
  woah now we 're getting foxnews here too, 
  good luck finding so many secular polaks, 
  guys notice how many non europeans are on this thread, 
  its a conspiracy against the white race !, 
  they are called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/useful_idiot, 
  why are there so many trolls from donald on this sub ? 
  and usually on russia related threads, 
  too many oligarchs in londongrad, 
  pretty much every industry has corruption in it, 
  yeah the sockpuppets, 
   look , if you are citing breitbard , chances that you are not from europe are a bit higher . 
  he is another right wing american troll attracted recently on european subs because of the non white immigration, 
  siege mentality can see it in other societies too, 
  its not a requirement for trolls, 
  why would such an eeeviiill institution like imf admit this ? 
   polish government would ally themselves with putin in five seconds , if not for the long-standing russia hate and that plane crash . 
  i trust pis in time to work on making it acceptable for poles to more obviously support russian interests orban needed time too, 
  wtf, 
   but can we do business with them it 's more than just business, 
  bribes and a sensibility to kremlins pan orthodox influence the orthodox church is very corrupt and very close to kremlin views, 
   we do n't like putins policies thats why there are prokremlin radicals in power, 
  but but kievpost is kiev propaganda outlet thats what ppl say , right ? 
  why is it not hiding this shit that kiev authorities do to a russian ? 
  serbia and romania only champions from half of europe !!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  surprise surprise schroders old party ... 
  let me guess . . its a socialdem who is saying that, 
  lol :d, 
  also yesterday 2 mps and an ex minister got sentenced, 
  the sub 's new right wing karma immigrants have a problem with israel too, 
  always were a target of their subversive activities, 
  also boxer bute got caught doping btw are we using some foreign conspiracy on this ? 
  like the russians do, 
  direct democracy at work, 
  both in particular italy is putin friendly i remember renzi visiting putin when he was most isolated after the annexation . 
  not orban was first with that . 
  they didnt really want it anyway . 
  like transnistria . 
  they only want to better influence kiev with it either with it transnistrianised or part of ukraine under special rules . 
  focus is option 2 now . 
  imo its like a poisoned gift now . 
  many failures but fewer refugees came while it lasted it seems like for some turkish visa is a bigger issue than the immigration . 
  rightwingers must be having such a hard time picking the bigger evil here :d, 
  like voting for homeopathy, 
  foreigners are bad foreign banks ' money is good, 
  yeah lots of 4chan trolls recently . 
  usually non european . 
   why is this news important ? 
  cuz op is serb, 
  oh so putin doesnt really care about saving the white european race from the muslims ? 
  some people will be very disappointed unless they are just fanboys, 
   it used to fund europe 's socialist and communist parties idk if it stopped, 
   that might sound appealing for a moment , but when you think about it for a bit it would n't be so great . 
  same can be said about the far right, 
   kovesi was appointed by ponta in 2013 , at the time the romanian government was desperately trying to join schengen , so they needed someone who would make them look good in the eu tho the other chiefs named ended up arrested, 
  misleading, 
  everyone knew before the vote than epp will put juncker in power, 
  it claims jurisdiction over neighbours tho :d, 
   but you know what 's the interesting part here ? 
  most of the corporations involved in major scandals in romania are western duh because almost all our trade is western, 
  svr being ? 
  nop, 
  nice the 4chan candidate lost, 
  tldr hp romania shareholders and directors of the social security house ( idk how you guys call it ) are investigated by prosecutors for fraud . 
  hp got 16mil euros illegally for some kind of it support for the institution . 
  it 's lead by an ex eu commissioner and the president is some friend of juncker but there 's some fidesz/pis type coalition trying to reform like the failed one in 2012, 
  i bet those sneaky jews are behind this, 
  based polan, 
  whos this gefira ? 
   also does n't help that the romanian orthodox church is a vile organization that for some reason seems to have the trust of ~ 60 % of the population . 
  the good news is that the % is going down bit by bit every year now, 
  that reminds me does fidesz have orbanbots, 
  they will find a diversion if they are questioned more, 
  most of them are center right what bullshit, 
  and pis, 
  it 's basically all from turkey , greece up north until the danube including romania partly because of dobrogea area, 
   syria = same as iraq, 
  europeans watched on average x less porn during - insert major entertainment event -, 
   you have lots in common . 
  had . 
  i get the feeling you are envious btw . 
  cossaks gon na get medal from putin now, 
  that would ruin circlejerking, 
   you can only quickly and effectively fight corruption if you are a dictator , like in china . 
  is that confirmed to work yet ? 
  in dictatorship btw u dont even find out much about corruption because of censorship, 
  going full retard here telegraph, 
  i dont see the eu being against italy on that btw romania too had child allowance doubled recently and bruxelles didnt complain one bit where is the commie conspiracy ? 
  what an idiot, 
  does germany hack the duma ? 
  that was cia sabotage, 
  i dont understand this kind of people,

   or the swiss-eec fta of 1972 contains nothing on labour mobility or migration the [ 1972 free trade agreement ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/world/agreements/preparecreatetreatiesworkspace/treatiesgeneraldata.do?step=0&amp;redirect=true&amp;treatyid=73 ) was in place only for certain products . 
  mostly agricultural products . 
   agreement between the european economic community and the swiss confederation  protocol n \u00b0 1 on the arrangement ** applicable to certain products **  protocol n \u00b0 2 on the products subject to a special treatment to take account of the differences in cost of the integrated ** agricultural products ** and it was later superseded by other eu trade agreements that span all trade relations and include freedom of movement . 
   until de conclusion of the set of seven bilateral agreements negotiated between 1994 and 1998 , concluded in 1999 and entered into force in 2002 , this 1972 agreement was the principal bilateral agreement between the european community and switzerland . 
  it provides for ** free trade in industrial products ** . 
  the 1972 agreement has been amended several times , in certain cases through the adoption of additional protocols . 
  ** some of these agreements were superseded by the further bilateral agreements entered into force in 2002 ( 7 agreements ) and in 2006 ( 9 agreements ) .

  free movement of people ... ...  you seem to be completely confused between what we call labour mobility , which can be any measure that facilitates migration of workers between two parties ( and which can be as minimal as shortening bureaucratic visa procedures ) ; and the freedom of movement for workers , which is very precisely defined by the eu . 
  freedom of movement was n't invented by the eu . 
  the eu does n't have the authority to define it 's meaning . 
  nobody has this authority because it 's not a black or white issue . 
  the same goes for free trade . 
  each trade agreement has different provisions regarding trade and the movement of people . 
  ... ... . .  of course an agreement between the eu and the uk would almost certainly include some form of labour mobility , as do most modern ftas . 
  this was my point all along . 
   he is a fucboi . 
  thanks for the kind words . 
   he beleives that mexicans have freedom of movement with the u.s. lol and that nafta provides freedom of movement . 
  [ nafta - mobility of persons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_free_trade_agreement#mobility_of_persons )  according to the department of homeland security yearbook of immigration statistics , during fiscal year 2006 ( i.e. , october 2005 through september 2006 ) , 73,880 foreign professionals ( 64,633 canadians and 9,247 mexicans ) were admitted into the united states for temporary employment under nafta ( i.e. , in the tn status ) . 
  additionally , 17,321 of their family members ( 13,136 canadians , 2,904 mexicans , as well as a number of third-country nationals married to canadians and mexicans ) entered the u.s. in the treaty national 's dependent ( td ) status . 
   canadian authorities estimated that , as of december 1 , 2006 , a total of 24,830 u.s. citizens and 15,219 mexican citizens were present in canada as `` foreign workers '' .

  this is not my `` belief '' . 
  these are official statistics . 
   cause freedom of movement for me means exactly that , that no border agent can refuse you entry because he does n't like your face or religion . 
  there are no restrictions based on race or religion .

   you are trying to compare the common market to a trade agreement . 
  a person who have taken a rudimentary economics class will be capable of seeing , that what you are saying is complete nonsense . 
  [ free trade areas in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_trade_areas_in_europe )  the eu shares its single market with three efta members via the european economic area agreement , and the remaining efta member -- switzerland -- via bilateral agreements . 
   the [ european economic area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_area ) ( eea ) is the area in which the agreement on the eea provides for the ** free movement of persons , goods , services and capital ** within the european single market , as well as the freedom to choose residence in any country within this area . 
  the eea was established on 1 january 1994 upon entry into force of ** the eea agreement ** . 
  there is a free trade agreement within the common market . 
  it 's called the eea agreement . 
   the other guy was implying that you had to have free movement as in the eu common market and even tried to claim that the common market was like any other trade agreement . 
  this is false . 
  i said that you ca n't have free trade without freedom of movement while also stating that these are not black or white issues . 
  i said they are directly proportionate to each other , meaning that there are always restrictions because trade is never 100 % free . 
  people take the terms `` free '' literally and expect things to be unrestricted and unregulated . 
  this is not true . 
   i 'm prone to agree with the latter as unrestricted immigration tend to lead to more negatives than positives . 
  freedom of movement is n't a black or white issue . 
  there are always restrictions on the conditions and duration of the stay that are directly proportionate to the freedom of the trade . 
  the eu allows people to move and even relocate to other eu member countries with very few restrictions . 
  local immigration policies still apply . 
  you still have to go through screening and the whole thing can be limited if too many people from one country start immigrating . 
  the idea that a `` wave of immigrants '' will engulf your country at any moment is just tabloid fear mongering propaganda . 
   i thought isis were in favour of terrorism as well ? 
  it 's about dup . 
  they support religious extremism , but not terror attacks . 
  at least as far as i know . 
   and all of them will include provisions on labor movement , but with so many restrictions calling that `` freedom of movement is a joke you 're debating semantics . 
  you ca n't call it `` 75 % freedom of movement '' . 
  it 's called freedom of movement because it allows people to move freely under certain conditions whereas this was n't possible before the deal was signed . 
  it does give people more freedom to move . 
  it 's not a joke . 
  the more free the trade , the more free the movement of people . 
  i 'm glad we agree on this because it 's been like this for ages . 
   new zealand has a free trade deal with china . 
  [ new zealand -- china free trade agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_zealand%e2%80%93china_free_trade_agreement )  under the agreement , 37 per cent of chinese exports to new zealand and 35 per cent of new zealand exports to china will be tariff free by october 2008 . 
  it 's not 100 % free trade . 
  because of that , freedom of movement is limited , but it does happen . 
   the deal also allows 1,800 specialised workers to go from china to new zealand for a period of up to three years . 
  you ca n't have trade without people from the other side . 
   there are no provisions for free movement of labour in there to the best of my knowledge . 
  [ visa-free travel to the eu launches in ukraine ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2017/06/11/visa-free-travel-to-the-eu-launches-in-ukraine )  while there is visa-free business travel as of a couple of days ago , those are entirely separate agreements . 
  it 's not just for business . 
  it 's for tourism as well . 
  both the recent visa-free travel and the dcfta are part of eu - ukraine negotiations .

   berlin finds itself surrounded by anti-austerity governments in the south -- greece , spain , portugal , italy -- and anti-refugee governments in the east . 
  while the south challenges berlin 's financial policies and rules , central europeans are challenging its model of the open society . 
  people want to run their own countries after their own rules ? 
  how tragic . 
   or is that just the knee-jerk insult we 're using for right wing politicians now ? 
  using `` fascist '' as a generic insult against the right has a very old tradition . 
  the berlin wall 's official name translates as `` anti-fascist protection rampart '' . 
   one thing should be clear to every member of the eu : no country can shoulder the burden of the refugee crisis alone . 
  we need to come to terms with our mistakes -- and learn from them . 
  if we do , the refugee crisis could be a chance to revitalize the union . 
  i think the biggest problem right now is that germany offers full resettlement without any sort of numerical limit . 
  as long as this policy stands efforts to secure the borders will end up just redirecting the flow . 
  this is what happened with hungary . 
  offering `` solidarity '' in the form of a eu-wide resettlement scheme will just prolong this situation . 
  we should instead refuse and make as much as full flow makes it 's way to germany as possible . 
  let 's them welcome refugees until they choke on it . 
  after germany ( and other less important countries ) admit their limits it will be possible to discuss some eu-wide strategy to deal with this . 
   i mean we invaded a rock with almost no strategic value with less than 3000 people on it half the world away just because they identify as british . 
  are you talking about the falklands ? 
  that was a defensive war and it was during the time of thatcher , a prime minister which is demonized by most of the british left . 
  if corbyn and his palls get into power then it would make a lot of sense to question if the uk would still honor security commitments . 
  i do n't trust that they would . 
  it 's nice to see criticism of eu institutions from the left but i am not convinced that somehow `` more democracy '' is the cure . 
  in particular i do n't think that it would have resulted in a more desirable outcome for greece . 
  austerity was imposed on the greeks because the alternative was seen to be perpetual subsidies and this is extremely unpopular in germany . 
  if you somehow held a fully democratic referendum with the combined voters of greece and germany the outcome would have still been unfavorable to the greeks . 
  the same would have happened if you asked this at the level of the entire eu . 
  eastern europe is outside of the euro but mostly on the side of germany on this issue . 
  after all , why should we support continuous subsidies of a richer and more profligate country ? 
  even if you made a democratic decision involving only eurozone countries it 's likely that greece would have lost . 
  democracy is not magic pixie dust . 
  you ca n't just grab an arbitrary collection of people , give them a set of democratic laws and institutions and expect government to work well . 
  in order for it to work it requires some sort of sense of shared fate as well as the willingness to accept losing power and being governed by others temporarily . 
  this is very very difficult . 
  scotland barely remained in the uk after the last referendum . 
  the fundamental reason for this desire to separate is because scots do n't particularly want to be ruled from london . 
  an independent scotland would lean quite a bit to the left of the rest of england and govern itself differently . 
  the biggest problem for eurofederalism is this : if you can barely convince scots to accept being ruled from london how do you expect greeks and poles to accept being ruled from brussels or berlin ? 
  the political differences are much larger in the latter cases . 
  i think that even if you waved a magic wand and created a set of perfectly accountable and democratic euro-federalist institutions overnight it would still not work . 
  such a state would immediately be crippled by separatism . 
    merkel 's policy can be summarized as [ . . ] immigration without upper limit  that 's not true . 
  she only stated that germany will not give an arbitrary cutoff point for awarding people asylum . 
  wtf ? 
  an `` upper limit '' and `` cutoff point '' are the exact same concept . 
   merkel opened the doors to the refugees hungary did n't want because she accepted germany 's role as europe 's default liberal political hegemon -- redemption and moral superiority were not driving factors . 
  germany 's willingness to act as a temporary `` protection giver of last resort '' reflected its desire to avert a humanitarian disaster at the heart of the eu and buy the continent time to come up with a multilateral solution to the crisis . 
  this is an interesting idea but seems like a needlessly elaborate rationalization . 
  i think that merkel just saw that the german public was overwhelmingly in favor of accepting the migrants and this turned into policy . 
  public opinion has since shifted somewhat but her position is still extremely strong . 
  by world standards she is an extremely popular leader . 
  i do n't think that this will `` buy time '' for a multilateral solution . 
  we are farther away from a common policy than ever and i expect that people will continue to get more entrenched in their positions . 
  there is no obvious reason why anyone would change their mind in favor of accepting migrants . 
  if germany is happy to 1 million why ca n't it take all of them , however many there are ? 
  the worst that could happen is that germany itself will change it 's mind or perhaps start facing serious internal issues . 
  this would be perfectly fine . 
  from behind soft paywall :  deport british activists who tell migrants to attack police , calais mayor says  british members of the no borders group are encouraging migrants to attack police in the area , french police warn , amid fresh calls for the army to be deployed at the `` jungle '' camp  the head of the calais region and the town 's mayor have urged the french government to deport a gang of british anarchists who they say are encouraging migrants to attack police . 
   xavier bertrand , president of the nord-pas-de-calais-picardie region , said it was time to `` prevent the ` no borders ' agitators and provocateurs , who sometimes tell migrants to attack the riot police , from continuing to do harm . ''  those who can not benefit from asylum should be `` expelled from the country , '' mr bertrand said before talks with the french justice and interior ministers . 
  eu member-states may deport citizens of other eu countries in the interests of public security . 
   mr bertrand and the mayor of calais , natacha bouchart , also renewed their call for soldiers to be deployed in the area to control an estimated 4,000 migrants camped near the port , and another 2,500 in dunkirk , barely 20 miles away . 
   police sources say the number of british `` no borders '' activists in the calais area varies from only about a dozen to as many as 200 at any given time . 
  some activists are french or come from other european countries . 
   people walk in a makeshift camp known as `` the jungle '' in calaispeople walk in a makeshift camp known as `` the jungle '' in calais photo : afp  gilles debove , a calais police union spokesman , said about 200 mainly british `` no borders agitators '' were in the area when migrants stormed a ferry last month , reportedly at the urging of the activists . 
  `` they ( the activists ) come and help the migrants but they also manipulate them . 
  they should not be inciting migrants to break french law . 
  if they want to demonstrate , they should do it in england , '' mr debove told the telegraph . 
   `` we need a much stronger judicial response , '' mr bertrand told france info radio as he called for britain to assume more responsibility for policing the border . 
   border force officers are already stationed in calais , but mr bertrand warned that the french authorities could not continue to keep migrants out of britain . 
  `` they ( the british ) must act . 
  if not , we will have to go back on the le touquet agreements ( which authorise british border checks in northern france ) . 
  we 're managing the english border in calais , in that case we should give it back to them . ''  riot policemen patrol through the migrant camp of calais , known as `` the jungle '' riot policemen patrol through the migrant camp of calais , known as `` the jungle '' photo : afp  mrs bouchart is accompanying mr bertrand to talks in paris with the interior minister , bernard cazeneuve , and the justice minister , jean-jacques urvoas . 
   `` as i can not accept that part of the territory of my town is no longer under control , i am asking the interior minister to expel people who have nothing to do there and who incite migrants to act in this way , '' mrs bouchart said , referring to the january 23 storming of a p&o ferry in calais by migrants . 
   calais residents are increasingly exasperated by the migrants ' presence , which many say has crippled the local economy , deterred tourists and led some haulage companies to avoid the port . 
   `` tension in calais has reached an unacceptable level , '' said mrs bouchart . 
   mr cazeneuve , the interior minister , said `` all demonstrations likely to disturb public order '' will be banned in the calais area `` as long as the current atmosphere continues '' . 
   the announcement came ahead of a planned demonstration in calais this weekend by the anti-immigrant group pegida , which has organised rallies in germany . 
  pegida is an german acronym for patriotic europeans against the islamisation of the west . 
  pegida held at least one march in calais last year . 
   the storming of the p&o ferry `` spirit of britain '' followed a pro-migrants demonstration . 
   so , as a result , we are running into the situation where whatever decision you make must break on the backs of these people , and quite possibly result in thousands of lives being lost . 
  but if people cross borders `` seeking a better life '' all you have to do is to ensure they do n't get much of anything . 
  you certainly do n't need to kill them . 
  in fact if people stopped crossing with flimsy boats from turkey to greece many fewer lives would be lost . 
  you can create giant refugee camps with turkey-like conditions and they 'll eventually stop moving . 
  you can do it on a greek island or on the austrian-german border , the location does n't particularly matter . 
  what is lacking is german political will to stop this movement . 
  most countries can do little more than redirect the flow as long as germany rewards breaching borders . 
   by the way , eurosceptics are just as much `` defeatists '' as europhiles . 
  the main argument seems to be that we cant reform the eu ... so why bother ? 
  there 's more to it than that . 
  if germany and france want a different kind of union for themselves then why should the uk fight tooth and nail for it 's particular vision ? 
  would n't it better and more civilized to let them play at ever-closer union and have the uk deal with them through alternative means ? 
  a peaceful divorce is not a defeat . 
    we must help those who are in distress or being persecuted . 
  at the moment , however , we can not help those who are merely seeking a better life  i mean , pretty much everybody agrees with this . 
  i do n't think that 's true , there is a lot of disagreement about this . 
  it can be argued that almost everybody who leaves turkey is `` merely seeking a better life '' and that they should qualify for asylum only if they are persecuted * by turkey * . 
  quite a lot of people would oppose such an approach . 
   realistically , who would oppose you if you would break the international deals ?

  eminescu , who is both romania and moldova 's national poet , was basically the guy who invented romanian nationalism . 
  i doubt he would be a big fan of an independent moldova . 
  even today , most moldovan musicians do n't stand a chance if they do n't `` become '' romanian . 
  just think where would anna lesko , pavel stratan , dan balan , carla 's dreams etc. 
  be if they did n't come to romania . 
  there are quite a few reasons : first , there are the `` homo sovieticus '' types , which are quite well represented in moldova . 
  they remember the `` good life '' they lived in the soviet union ( in reality their life was only less shit than it is today , but it was still shit ) and dream of a day when the soviet union will return . 
  in school , they were also taught that romania treated them as second hand citizens and it is only thanks to the soviet union that they were liberated from the bloodthirsty fascist romanian imperialists . 
  secondly , the russian speaking minority in moldova remained very influential even after the collapse of the soviet union , and they are the biggest supporters of the idea that moldovans are an ethnically distinct group from romanians , a sort of mixture between romans and slavs . 
  they are also the biggest fans of the idea that moldovan is actually a language and that it is distinct from romania ( although this idea has been steadily losing popularity in the last few years ) . 
  thirdly , there are the politicians and oligarchs , who obviously do n't want to lose their power , money , influence and in many cases , their freedom ( most moldovan oligarchs and politicians could be easily sent to prison if they were under the juristiction of the romanian dna ) . 
  pro-russian politicians simply repeat the views of the russian speaking minority , while pro-eu politicians say things like `` the time has n't come yet '' , `` moldova has too many problems , we ca n't unite '' etc. 
  lastly , there 's a category of people who simply do n't care or consider the possibility of the two countries uniting so unlikely that it would be pointless to even discuss it . 
  moldova , for sure , however , it 's more like a sister nation . 
  only it 's the kind of sister who is a crackhead , ca n't get job , prostitutes herself and only comes to you when she needs cash , spending the rest of her time with her drug dealer and pimp ( we all know who that is ) . 
  so , for someone who does n't work with watts , volts , amps and ohms on a daily basis , how does this stack up with the average smartphone/laptop battery ? 
  in craiova there is gypsy gang activity , constanta is also pretty dangerous , but actual murders are rare in major cities . 
  most murders happen in rural areas ( i.e. 
  two idiot hillbillies get drunk , one hits the other with an axe in the head ) . 
  romania is colored incorrectly , in moldavia there 's only one county probably has half of all the murders and 2/3 of the rapes in the country , namely vaslui county . 
  i remember somewhere reading that native americans are more prone to poverty and violent crime , so ... 
  um , nope , i do n't think so . 
  the mediation courts were set up simply to ease pressure on prosecutors and judges , who had way to many cases . 
  it 's not even an old law , it was adopted like 10 years ago . 
  we also have the so-called `` mediation courts '' in romania , where the victim and the rapist meet and can come to an agreement , usually involving financial compensation for the victim , in exchange for not pursuing the case in court . 
  i think it 's horrible idea , for two reasons - first because it helps affluent people avoid prosecution for rape , a very serious crime , and second because it encourages fake rape accusations from women seeking to make some easy money . 
   what about djohan ? 
  anyone know the origin ? 
  i think it 's an indonesian name . 
  the law can be enforced only to an extent . 
  if , in an arbitrary city , there is one case of some pervert touching some girl 's boobs on public transit every week , the law can be easily enforced by the police , but if there were 100 per week , it 's unreasonable to consider the law could be properly enforced in each and every case , and it would even be a bad idea to try and do so , because it would divert resources reserved for other , more serious crimes . 
  when a problem grows beyond the police and courts ' ability to handle each individual case , the authorities need to figure out a different solution to fight the problem , and statements like this german mayor made are not exactly helpful . 
   however grandfather is referring to 10 year old girl here . 
  and the answers this mayor gives makes me question how did he get such position in the first place . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  in romania we currently have a group of socialist mps who are supporting the introduction of compulsory school uniforms , and their argumentation can be summarised as `` girls who wear short skirts attract the looks of their male classmates '' . 
  their names do n't sound very australian to me , tbh . 
  the titles are nothing compared with the subtitles , especially for offensive words , like : motherfucker , asshole , son of a bitch -  nenorocit -  something along the lines of `` unlucky bastard '' fuck !, 
  -  to the devil fuck you !, 
  -  go to the devil we fucked ( i.e. 
  we had sex ) -  ne-am tras-o -  we pulled it ** and , best of all : ** shit -  rahat -  turkish delight, 
  it was ... before 2014 . 
   that territory is also not seen as romanian territory ; tighina ( bender ) is still rightful romanian clay . 
  transnistria also contains like 30 % romanians . 
  most of them are russified , thus they can go fuck themselves , but you 're still left with a significant legit romanian minority in transnistria which needs to be protected . 
  they 'll be happy when they learn moldovans are n't of the `` allahu akbar '' variety . 
  you know russia does n't really produce anything useful ( besides oil & gas ) , right ? 
  the only other thing they produce are military related stuff , but we 're nato members , so we would n't buy their shit anyway . 
  nope , it would be excluded from the eu as soon as it gets independence . 
  if scotland had actually gained independence from the uk , it would not have automatically become an eu member and they would have had to apply for eu membership . 
   but inherit the relationship of the autonomous regions of gagauzia and transnistria , though i imagine transnistria would n't approve . 
  transnistria is n't an autonomous region , it 's a de facto state , moldova has zero authority there . 
  as for gagauzia , i can see a couple of problems : 1 . 
  a region ca n't be autonomous because it would go against the romanian constitution . 
  changing that article to allow autonomous regions is pretty much out of the question . 
  the reason gagauzia has any sort of autonomy is because they blackmailed moldova . 
  moldova has a shit army , they knew they 'd lose again if they had to deal with another transnistria , si they just gave them autonomy . 
  there is one special clause though , if moldova were to ever unite with romania , gagauzia would have `` the right to self determination '' . 
  yeah , russia fucked them in the ass . 
  if you look at transnistrian news , you 'll notice they do n't even glorify russia like in the good ol' days , heck , they do n't even mention putin anymore . 
  edit : look , in their [ latest new bulletin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sszagkrwuo ) , there 's no mention of russia or putin . 
  nope . 
  they used to be , before the war in ukraine , back when the russians were still subsidising transnistria , but nowadays they 're in deep shit , just like the rest of moldova . 
  transnistria is already pretty much fucked , it 's like europe 's own mini north korea . 
  if you understand romanian , you should watch one of their news bulletins , they mention `` the president '' like every 30 seconds . 
   with romania being a potential trade center for russian products what russian products ? 
  besides oil and gas , obviously ? 
  i 'm pretty sure with all the corruption in moldova , a few hundred euros here , a few hundred euros there , and before you know it , both your grandparents were born on the territory of the republic of moldova and you 're eligible to become a moldovan citizen . 
  the fact you never hear about romanians getting moldovan citizenship , it 's mostly because they do n't want it and it 's pretty useless anyway . 
  that is the nominal gdp per capita , which is n't really useful for comparing standards of living . 
  nominal gdp is simply the gdp of the country converted into dollars , at the current exchange rate . 
  it does not take into account things like the fact that rent , utility bills , groceries , insurance etc. 
  are much cheaper in romania than they are in the uk . 
  to account for that , ppp gdp per capita is used : country | gdp per capita ( ppp 2015 ) --------- | ----------------- uk | $ 41.000 romania | $ 20.700 moldova | $ 5.000 so this makes moldova roughly 4 times poorer than romania , but romania is only 2 times poorer than the uk . 
  it is , if you look at the ppp numbers , nominal gdp per capita is n't very useful when comparing standards of living . 
   theoretically could eu block this ? 
  it could discourage it , but i do n't think they could block it if there was a legit referendum in both countries . 
   what would moldova 's status be in the union ? 
  it would n't have any status on its own , since it would just cease to exist , it would likely be split into several counties . 
  they can rest assured , we do n't even have enough prisons to put all their asses in . 
  because we 'd have to . 
  pensions , salaries of state employees , welfare benefits and the minimum wage are the same , regardless of the region . 
  not to mention we 'd have to retrain all their police officers , teachers , lawyers , judges , prosecutors , doctors etc. 
   do romanians know they will have to solve the transistrian issue if this happens ? 
  tbh , i doubt more than half of romanians have even heard about transnistria . 
  if a referendum would really happen , i 'd expect many of those 68 % to nope the fuck out when they start learning about moldova 's problems . 
   also +600 k people from a an extremely poor region will put a lot of weight on the state transnistria is just as poor as moldova , so it would be 3.5 million people from an extremely poor region , not just 600k . 
  if i would be calling the shots , i 'd just hand over transnistria to ukraine after a population exchange ( romanians from transnistria in exchange for russians/ukrainians in moldova ) and let the sort it out . 
  transnistria would n't be such a big problem for ukraine , since its not significantly poorer than ukraine , and ukrainians ( although pro-russian ukrainians ) are the biggest ethnic group . 
   i mean , okay , i understand giving up one 's state has some emotional pain in it , but seriously , it 's moldova , known as the poorest country in europe . 
  unlike estonians , which kept their integrity throughout the ordeal of the su , moldovans were relatively successfully brainwashed to believe romanians are a bunch of fascists who eat little babies for breakfast . 
  also , because of the extreme poverty , most moldovans have never traveled abroad or even spoke with a romanian before . 
  to them , romanians are as foreign as germans or americans . 
  pro-russian propaganda also does not help , they portray romania as either america 's colony , zombies of the evil homo-nazi eu , or fascist-imperialist ( yeah , quite funny pro-russians love to portray romanians as imperialists , despite the fact that we have far less experience annexing other countries than russia ) . 
  given these circumstances , it 's unsurprising most of the moldovan unionists are based in chisinau , where the population is a bit better educated . 
  the mayor of chisinau is one of the best known unionists in moldova , he never misses a chance to talk about uniting the two countries . 
   romania , on the other hand , despite being considerably better off than moldova , is still a poor country for eu standards . 
  absorbing moldova would require some considerable financial resources , and even if eu aided with some , it would still mean romanians contributing some of their own wealth . 
  i do agree with you on this one , the current difference in gdp per capita between romania and moldova is bigger than the difference between the uk and romania . 
  even if romania and moldova were to unite , it would take decades and dozens of billions of euros for moldova to reach the level of even romania 's poorest counties .

  well yes , it 's political , and brits are ignorant if they still claim it should be just economical or that they did n't know it 's also a political union . 
  anyway , your point was not clear at all from the start . 
  it 's ironic you do n't realize you yourself are implying that we should punish thought crimes . 
  do n't be afraid though , just come out and say it . 
  i feel like some people are conflating some amount of `` understandable '' with justified . 
  it 's not justified , even if it might be slightly understandable . 
  although electing populist reactionaries is almost never a good solution . 
   he policy of letting anyone in to europe , the policy of multiculturalism and political correctness promoted by paris and berlin over the years . 
  which does n't at all explain the situation . 
  france did n't just let people in , france conquered those countries where they came from . 
  whatever , it does n't matter . 
  that was a long time ago and now most have been living in france for generations . 
  the solution is obviously not being against pc , how the fuck does that solve anything ? 
  the solution is to better educate and integrate the people that are already there , since they ai n't leaving . 
  so what you 're saying is that it might be related more to that rather than pc , multiculturalism or whatever the fuck the other guy was saying . 
  you 're claiming it is an economical union in the same post you 're claiming it 's a political union . 
  your stance makes no sense . 
  it 's obviously both and was intended as both from the very start . 
  if the brits did n't know that , it 's because they 're ignorant as fuck about the eu . 
  so only 23 % of the leave campaign are foaming at the mouth racists . 
  good to know . 
  that really puts my worries to rest . 
  you 'd think that would work , but it 's a losing proposition , anyone in politics knows this . 
  if you 're constantly busy correcting whatever bullshit the other side spews , you 're going to end up losing . 
  nobody can keep up with all the lies and narratives and most rebuttals are actually complex enough and hard enough to understand that most people wo n't even care . 
  lies are easy tho , all you need is one big sensationalist title in a tabloid . 
  imo what needs to happen is media outlets being held to some actual standards , fuck all that opinions are all valid bullshit , if a newspaper is caught with a blatant lie , it should be forced to retract it in the same manner in which they published it , which is with a huge fucking catchy title right on their frontpage . 
  it 's incredible how easily you swallow farage 's populist bullshit . 
   some people are so consumed by their political ideology , that they will hate and repress anybody who expresses concerns about it . 
  hate and repression . 
  who are the good guys and who are the bad guys ? 
  hey , i actually agree with that , it 's just that in case you have n't noticed , it was the leave campaign that has spread hate throughout all the years . 
  so yeah , people are so consumed by ideology they do n't even realize they 're acting like a bunch of tools . 
  http://lawvolumes.dwp.gov.uk/docs/a9-1001.pdf#page=2  determined to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of europe , resolved to ensure the economic and social progress of their countries by common action to eliminate the barriers which divide europe it 's right there on the 1 ` st page . 
  sorry , not all of us have selfish idiots for friends . 
  they 're extremely connected . 
  the point i was making is that a real democracy should have real and strong opposition to whomever is in power , you see it all over the west , parties are actually battling each other , trading blows , winning elections . 
  in russia there is putin and his party and most of the opposition is just for show so it does n't seem like putin is actually a dictator . 
  problem is though that actions betray putin , because censorship is a big problem in russia , propaganda is real , opposition gets silenced , media gets silenced , the government makes it really hard to register new parties and so on . 
  you 're right . 
  it is a coincidence considering that russia , one of the most naturally wealthy countries on earth , with a population exceeding 100 million , does not even have real opposition to putin . 
  nobody 's saying the eu will impose sanctions , so i do n't know why you compare the situation to russia . 
  however giving the uk such a compromise would absolutely hurt the eu . 
  it 's choosing short-term economic gain in the detriment of credibility and incentives given to countries that might want to leave . 
  what hitler and the eu want are completely different in both scope and methods . 
  he may not be technically wrong , but propaganda does n't have to be a lie either , it 's manipulation employed through various tools . 
  and i was n't even talking about boris johnson , lots of leavers were outright saying that without understanding how the eu works at all . 
  the uk got all all of that special treatment because it was perceived as worth it for having them be members of the eu . 
  now that it 's gone and the people have made it clear they do n't want none of that , it would be absolutely stupid for the eu to do the uk a solid by giving them yet more preferential treatment . 
  what message does that send ? 
  you can have your cake and eat it too ? 
  nope , that wo n't fly . 
  in fact , it 's in the interest of the eu to make this as hard and painful for the uk as possible . 
  again , it might have something to do with the leave campaign and the attitudes of brexiters . 
  how nice can you really be to someone that compares you to the 4 ` th reich ? 
  now that you 've voted leave , of course people want to see you out , what the fuck do you expect , people crying over it ? 
  if you check out polls before the referendum though , you 'll see most people in every country wanted the uk to stay , because until then , leavers were just some assholes trying to pull a con , after the referendum leavers became the `` official '' voice of the uk . 
  a pretty big insult for the rest of us . 
  nope , we 're all about giving a middle finger to each other now . 
  they slighted us , now we fuck them back !, 
  what can go wrong ... 
  reaching high political office = / smartest man in the world . 
  you have to be charming first and foremost , and flexible . 
  ever so flexible . 
  what he said is still true tho , do you really think the police gives a fuck about investing the disappearance of a gypsy kid ? 
  they 'd at least pretend to give a fuck if it was just some poor romanian family . 
  yeah the far right does n't exist / s, 
  you 're willfully ignorant if you need to ask that question in the first place . 
  he 's a populist that loves to race-bait , is an anti-intellectual , climate change denying , anti-vaccines , war crimes advocate and authoritarian that wants to make mexico pay for a huge wall . 
  at this point you have to be really brainwashed in order to still support him . 
  still , we can trust the americans to elect people such as reagan , nixon , bush and now trump . 
  itt : people saying it was a good speech without realizing it 's just empty populist rhetoric . 
  she 's going to fight for the little guy by signing a trade agreement that states china can violently rape the british working class in exchange for high paying execs making even more money by trading with them . 
  the assassination of various journalists critical of the government gave me a hint . 
  that 's just not true . 
  many of those people would be unemployed , not productive members of society . 
  it 's not really fair to have a single market without free movement of labor for the poorer more underdeveloped parts of europe . 
  the deal is that western countries get new markets in which to invest and export to , while poorer countries get to reduce their unemployment and state burden by having a mobile workforce . 
  without single market access as it currently is , romania for example would probably have huge unemployment problems and the state would be very burdened , this way the millions of people that could n't find jobs here have the opportunity to move to richer countries and also get to send some money back for their families back home . 
  the downside for us is that our own industry and business have to compete with yours , which is n't easy considering how far behind most of them were when we joined the eu . 
  foreign companies absolutely dominate our market . 
  the single market is thought out in such a way as to give benefits to all the members , to further integration and to help achieve economic convergence of the poor east with the rich west . 
  tl : dr ; without free movement of labor the poorer eastern and southern nations would be absolutely screwed . 
  you 're right , there 's media outlets in the west that are pretty much just as propagandistic as the russian ones , the real difference is given by the fact that in the west you have very many sources so information and not all are equally biased or biased in the same direction , there 's left leaning , right leaning , but also outlets with very good journalistic integrity . 
  in russia unfortunately people only really get blatant pro-government propaganda which makes it way harder to form a more objective view on things . 
  the russian population was used as a weapon by the ussr , the people born there are unwilling participants so to speak , but that does n't change the fact that they 've been used as a means of ethnic cleansing . 
  i 'm not the one saying shit like `` it 's ok to hate muslims because of what the ottoman empire did 300 years ago '' or `` it 's ok to hate blacks because some of them hate whites too ! '', 
  lol you 're a fucking retard i swear . 
  btw , it does n't take a leftist to call you out for the racist idiot you are , sorry to disappoint , but you 're not getting anything right . 
  it 's for sure true , the amount of vitriol just can not be compared both in intensity , validity of claims or duration . 
  you 're right tho that everyone notices the vitriol directed against them the most , but objectively they are n't really comparable either . 
  ok , let me rephrase it , leavers hate the eu more than people that wanted the uk to stay hate the uk for leaving . 
  better ? 
  in both cases it 's about uk and eu citizens respectively , but what i really wanted to say is that the leave campaign has been going on for years and it has produced some very toxic , very insulting and very divisive rhetoric , in no way comparable to the people criticizing the uk 's choice to leave following the referendum . 
  do a lot of people think the uk is stupid for leaving ? 
  yes . 
  do they think the uk is acting like a spoiled child ? 
  yes . 
  do they believe the uk is some nazi country controlled by evil dictators hell-bent on destroying europe ? 
  a part of the leavers do think that about the eu though and they have no shame repeating it over and over .

  perhaps there is a future where the eea extends far further than where is now . 
  but that 's all pie-in-the-sky thinking . 
  they can choose not to sign . 
  but that change will be public and obvious , instead of the current system of pretense where everyone says they 're working hard on ... doing nothing . 
  absolutely nothing . 
  and then we on the outside having to play detective to who is trying to stop what , and who is getting investment from the chinese to prevent tarrifs , and who is just trying to grandstand for the public . 
  that has had it 's time , it 's now time for it to die . 
  i can agree with using the money better , definitely . 
  but this :  lets not tell member coutries what they should do with their internal affairs . 
  i can only imagine what this means , but it sounds like the `` rule of law '' and `` democracy '' checks . 
  my country benefited a lot by those , the political class got clobbered by them . 
  i would never support removing them . 
  if you 're asked to become a functional liberal democracy to join the eu . 
  then you should be expected to act like one afterward . 
  for everything that is not `` rule of law '' , there is the principle of subsidiarity which is doing just fine . 
   the sooner the eu starts crumbling the better it is for all the european nations well maybe not for germany and france . 
  man does n't know when the concert of europe were dividing the smaller nations like pieces of cake among themselves . 
  yes , let 's return to that . 
  it will surely be the big , rich nations that loose out , not the small nations that have to bend to their wishes . 
  i share the same fear . 
  i fear my country will be turned into a buffer zone , that we 'll be abandoned again to fend for ourselves , that we 're currency to buy the west peace . 
  but that 's why i want to tear down the hegemonic alliance system of the present . 
  to create courts and parliaments that have power to prevent that betrayal . 
  to create an army that will not just fight for my freedom , but will also win . 
  i want to not go back to the past , it 's a terrifying place for my nation , i want to find a future where there is more to hold us together than empty promises on a piece of paper . 
   yet we do at least still have the last say on where we deploy or send our troops to . 
  the dutch will always be given a vote in the council . 
  you ca n't say your say is being taken away . 
  but you have to understand that unless you wake up to the realities of what is coming out of russia and the middle east , it '' s only a matter of time until you find yourself facing them yourself rather than poland and greece acting as your shield . 
  you ca n't look at this as just being dutch , consider the big picture . 
  it 's the same as those people who reject vaccination have to look at the fact that they 're riding on the graces of everyone else immunizing themselves . 
  they 're fine , until they 're not . 
  this is europe . 
  we live on the bones of empires , kingdoms and nations who had charismatic men lead desperate people to their doom . 
  sometimes , reason does n't matter , you can only ride on the tide of desperation . 
  the illiberal democracies know that , but they have no vision , they 'll just ride that wave until it swallows them up and they 're replaced with more unethical men . 
  so it was , and so it will be again . 
   that would require abandoning neoliberalism , which the eu have already shown they have no interest in doing the eu is hardly neoliberalist in the first place , the neoliberalist actually hate it because it has too many regulations and restrictions . 
  the epp is neoliberalist and the solution is to stop voting for political parties that are epp in your national governments . 
  the biggest surprise here is the dutch government . 
  they also are stopping the creation of the eppo , the prosecutor office made to handle and stop the european funds abuses that they complain about in the first place . 
  can any dutch folk explain what is going on with your government ? 
  are we going to hear from sch\u00e4uble soon about how everything is absolutely fine and juncker should not have an opinion ? 
  i might dislike juncker , but at least he 's not as detached from the way the world is heading as the german government . 
  do less things so there 's less chance of someone taking offense ? 
  do you really think that a solution to anything but waiting for the death blow ? 
  we 're in post-truth politics , if you 're not on the acting side you 're being acted on . 
  i say the opposite , increase funding , increase rule of law restrictions , increase border protection , increase public investment . 
  be active , solve things or at least try to . 
  do n't fear criticism , but irrelevance . 
   this would be a centrist movement . 
  have you been paying attention ? 
  there is no centrism anymore , the center-right and center-left and pretty much holding on by listening to poll numbers and trying to not fuck up too much and are ideologically bankrupt . 
  they 're slowly being pulled in every direction . 
  we need a significant dose of iconoclasm and guts to make it against the new demagogues . 
  we ca n't afford to compromise . 
  a conservative reactionary demagogue is a conservative reactionary demagogue , no matter their creed . 
  it 's time to show the world the punch and judy show they 're creating . 
  the present left can cry all they like , but they 're already loosing to those factions . 
  you 're reiterating the mantra of the last 10 years , `` enhanced cooperation '' . 
  but it does n't work , the national leaders are playing variants of the prisoners dilemma thinking they 're smart enough to get ahead . 
  we need to stop expecting them to pull together , and demand , by law and treaty if necessary , they do something or step back and leave somebody else to fix those issues . 
   europe is not a nation . 
  by definition there can never be a european nationalist party . 
  europe is a meta-nation . 
  a family of nations united by common values and history , and more importantly a willingness to work together rather than apart . 
   and sorry , but there 's no such thing as a `` common culture '' in europe - the countries comprising europe are far too diverse this is a lie , and anyone who has been outside europe can tell you . 
  we 're nothing like the middle east , south east asia or sub-saharan africa . 
  we have more respect for the unfortunate than north america , and more respect for the rule of law than south america . 
  true , there are still many nations around the world that can be considered european , but we are neighbours as well . 
  and the most important thing that binds us together is : we decided to overcome the few differences we have and work together . 
  that decision overshadows everything as long as we keep to making it true . 
  finally showing his true colours . 
  not a misunderstood patriot , but a mad consummate europhobe using every lie and tool he has to undermine european unity . 
  finland , denmark and sweden , do n't make up the whole * general public . 
  and at 44 % for and 35 % opposed , the general public seems to be actually supportive . 
  if you want to make the point that the nordics are n't supportive , make that point . 
  at least you can actually back that up . 
  hell , start `` efta 2 : this time we mean it '' for all i care , there 's bigger fish to fry .

   were you planning anything else for the next 50 years ? 
  because you might want to reschedule . 
  i know it sounds dire , but approaching things with pessimism might be the best pace right now . 
   number 3 will only deter the smaller nations like ireland and grow anti eu feeling . 
  if ireland are left out , they 're left out . 
  no hard feelings , at least as long as we 're never attacked and in need of assistance . 
  but other smaller nations , like the baltics , absolutely need the security . 
  and grow anti-eu feeling ? 
  doing nothing grows anti-eu feeling , doing something grows anti-eu feeling . 
  how about we just try to do what is right and see where it takes us rather than worry about somebody having a bad opinion before we approach step 1 . 
   all of this talk about defending against the big bully putin when the bigger eu states will force smaller ones to hate the nations they want them to hate . 
  you were n't in an eastern european country when bush was rounding up the coalition of the willing were you ? 
  also , it 's the smaller nations in eastern europe that are trying to pull the secure and far away west into seeing the threat we see , not the other way around . 
  honestly , the statement is more an insult to the intelligence of the people of smaller states . 
  and even a non-sequitor since a central command has nothing to do with any of that . 
  the alt-right movement spent two decades thumping their brand of knee-jerk reactionism before it started paying off . 
  the new left in southern europe spent less than one , but they manage to ride in on the banking crises and the resulting budget austerity . 
  you 've got to accept that it takes time . 
  but with dedication , even the most empty of demagoguery has the opportunity to sound like sweet music . 
  the challenge is to be better than that , to add substance to the rhetoric .

  not many jews to shout slurs at , but there still is quite enough . 
  nowhere near the level of hungary though ... 
  you should write a book about it . 
  you could name it `` my struggle '' . 
  seems like a catchy title . 
  this is not a pipe, 
  i confirm this . 
  those are awesome series . 
  [ thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1642o8/dear_reurope_id_like_to_watch_some_of_your_tv/ ), 
   this particular course of action has already been put into effect in the city of utrecht , where similar problems have been dealt with by demolishing critical areas that acted as enclaves of hate . 
  interesting . 
  do you have anything more detailed about the action in utrecht ? 
  like an article or something ? 
  romania checking in . 
  this is us : video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m9iix4ehdy interpretation : [ tumblr ] ( http://24.media.tumblr.com/6c42f908eb8c3467d052614bb3559a6e/tumblr_mmwthmjqzk1qasnlzo1_500.jpg ) ~ ~ the shame ... ~ ~ * fuck it , i changed my mind . 
  we were fabulous and i regret nothing !, 
  how interesting . 
  does this stem from something like the fact that the political power was in low german area but the prestige dialect was some form of high german ? 
  ok , i can work with car analogies . 
  * you have have a peugeot . 
  your neighbour has a renault . 
  your other neighbour has a bmw , or a fiat , each inherited from their father . 
  now suddenly , the state says that for the sake of national unity we are all renault-owners , and only renault owners can benefit from state subsidies , and only renault can open spare part shops , and all mechanics are only trained to fix renaults . 
  * * so you either learn to fix it yourself and pay extra to ship in parts from abroad and so on , or you sell the peugeot to the scrap yard and go through the trouble of saving up money for a new car , a renault . 
  the people who inherited renaults do not have this financial handicap , and you ca n't help but wonder if the state is treating everyone equally or favoring renault-owners . 
  * the thing is i understand where you are coming from , but france had the unique advantage of implementing this policy early . 
  hungary tried as well a bit later and it lead to the alienation of its non-hungarian speakers ( including transylvania romanians ) . 
  turkey tried this and they 've been having trouble with the kurds since forever . 
  greece is the only other country that managed to pull off this french style system . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that the french system has some inherent flaws that make it seem anything but fair when you 're in the minority . 
  i say we call it a day . 
   and therefore do not exist legally . 
  but they do exist , even if the state does n't recognize them . 
  if turkey only recognizes turkish as a language , is the turkish language not given preferential status over kurdish ? 
   do you have any examples of dialects that appeared recently ? 
  that evolved over the past one or two centuries ? 
  i ca n't think of one . 
  dialect , no . 
  but the [ northern cities vowel shift ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_cities_vowel_shift ) is a phonetic divergence that is fairly recent ( 19th century ) . 
  also keep in mind that languages can also appear via language contact . 
  [ singlish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/singlish ) is an english-based creole which similarly has its origins in the 19th century . 
  [ a video about it ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg5gr-rjewy ) [ tok pisin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tok_pisin ) is another example of language on the rise which has its roots in english ( although it might be a bit older ) . 
  i 'm sure there are better examples of recent appearances i 'm not aware of . 
   oh i get where you 're at . 
  i 'm not an advocate of the french system , i was simply trying to explain why the french constitution is the way it is . 
  i see . 
  i misread your intentions then . 
   unitary europe : not doable . 
  i agree . 
  languages can still diverge even with increased communication . 
  think of how english differs in different regions of the world . 
  also relying on a written language does not mean the languages will converge . 
  arabic has a written standard - msa - but the spoken versions are very different from one another . 
  dialects will continue to form even in today 's interconnected world . 
  sure , smaller languages might die out , but the big ones are n't going anywhere . 
  my original point was to take the model you advocate , and bring it up a level so that french is not the dominant language anymore , but one of those regional languages that you think is easily expendable for the sake of national unity . 
  i used the example of federal europe because it was the most likely candidate , and because by your logic , that would need a unifying language as well . 
  a better , but way more unlikely , example would be \u201e the centralized and unitary nation of europe '' . 
  the problem is now we are talking about how the federal system is not the same as the french system . 
  but i would have assumed you are an advocate of the french system , since you seemed to co me to its defense . 
  now i 'll ask one more time : * do you support the implementation of the french system on a european level , given its advantages , with french being replaced by english ? 
  by the very fact that it recognizes only one language there is a dominant linguistic group . 
   that 's the equality part in our motto yeah . 
  everybody is equal , but the dominant linguistic group is more equal than the others . 
   how would state language be irrelevant in a federation ? 
  i was making the analogy with france 's constitution and its one language policy , but moving it up from the state level to the federal level . 
  \u201e the only official language of the eu is english '' and that would make state languages something extra-curricular , thus hardly relevant ( or at least , as relevant to the federation as breton or occitan ) . 
   you get the federal language ( official , everyone knows it ) , and then the state language . 
  then you could very well add regional languages as well . 
  how are they different ? 
  that 's why i gave it only as an example of what i would like to see . 
  a nice detailed census , or survey at least , would answer a lot of questions . 
   it 's not like there will be any problem afterwards , right catalonia ? 
  the policies of language supression during franco have more to do with catalonia 's dislike of madrid than the charter you speak of . 
  on the other hand , valencia and the balearics do n't seem to be going anywhere . 
  neither is galicia . 
  even the basques seem to have calmed down . 
  selection bias much ? 
  it would be much better if there would be some large surveys , or if the census inquired about mother tongue . 
  it avoids problems inherent to anecdotal evidence and other biases . 
  something like [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_in_france#statistics ) . 
   it 's inevitable that we all speak one language someday . 
  no we wo n't . 
  languages tend to die out , yes , but they also tend to diverge . 
   imagine you 're only ever taught in gaelic because you live in a region where most people speak it , and you travel , you look for a job , and you end up in endinburgh and everyone else speaks english . 
  you 're not going to feel like you belong , even though it 's your country . 
  imagine you are born into a minority , and you go to 1st grade and are expected to learn everything in the official language , which you almost never heard in your familial environment . 
  you feel like the system is set up for the dominant linguistic group . 
  they get the privilege of having their mother tongue made official , for you it 's an extra obstacle you have to overcome . 
  you have to take extra steps to protect and cultivate your language , while for the others , the state does it by default . 
  there are more ways than one to feel like you do n't belong , even though it 's your country . 
   as long as there is an equal amount of opportunities to learn both english and whatever the language in our state is . 
  well , state language would be irrelevant now . 
  we would have the common english language , which would make \u201e national languages '' obsolete , and then everybody else could learn whatever they would want . 
  you are avoiding the question . 
  i did n't ask whether we are there yet . 
  i asked whether you support it when the eu becomes a federation . 
  so do you support making english the only official language of the eu if it becomes a full blown federation ? 
  that 's because it does n't yet have an army and a navy . 
  wallachia is now available .

  you must be kidding , just think how much the crown jewels are worth , their value goes beyond just the gemstones and whatever else is in them , the historical value makes them almost priceless . 
  getting into ee or mechatronics is almost impossible without the ability to do high level math . 
  i think srs is leaking . 
  the difference in unemployment rate is the biggest reason for those numbers , if they are in fact accurate . 
  bulgaria has just under 13 % unemployment , romania 's is at about 6.6 % .

  i have no idea if those figures are right or wrong , but that 's not what this is about . 
  at least they have the correct names over the right countries , it 's something . 
  it 's not remarkable at all . 
  from an economical standpoint it 's a direct consequence of a badly constructed euro , from a political standpoint it 's a consequence of germany & co using `` us vs them '' rhetoric and policies to win domestic elections even if those policies cause the economies of whole countries to crumble . 
  what language is that ? 
  please speak english in this subreddit . 
  absolutely not . 
  not really a surprise for anyone not getting their information from the uk press . 
  truth is that most of the people that really wanted to live and work somewhere else they already did it . 
  of those that have n't left but are thinking about it , they most likely wo n't leave unless they already have a firm job offer . 
  he has no argument , if he did he would n't have posted this with a throwaway account since it 's not a post that justifies using such a thing , which means he 's just a coward and a hypocrite . 
  the fact that he had to resort to quoting posts from a shitty circlejerk subreddit like / r/imgoingtohellforthis only serves to prove that . 
  oh so brave , you 're posting from a throwaway posts somebody else made on / r/imgoingtohellforthis . 
  if you 're not going to have the courage to post under your real account so we too can go digging into your post history than that means you 're a hypocrite and a coward . 
  with the track record the us has , it 's slovakia that should worry about receiving some freedom soon . 
  no way is romania ready to join the euro and to be honest i do n't want us to join it even if we did qualify , i 'm convinced the eurozone is deeply flawed as it currently stands and needs much reform . 
  when i first started reading the article i thought it was satire , only at the end did i realize that this guys really believes what he 's saying . 
  completely delusional . 
  it 's pure nostalgia , people forget the dark dark days of the 80s when you 're right , romania was more like north korea than probably any nation in europe . 
  when you remind them of this fact the standard reply is , yeah the 80s were `` pretty bad '' but the 60s and 70s were good . 
  what they actually remember is that they were young in the 60s and 70s and they 'd so love to be young again . 
  cyprus really should leave the euro now , it wo n't stop the contraction of the gdp , but it will moderate it somewhat and also speed up recovery . 
  if you stay on the euro it will probably take you a decade , if not more , to recover . 
  that went straight over your head , did n't it ? 
  not that i wish an economic crises on anyone , but i just ca n't help to notice the schadenfreude in this situation . 
  well i 'm convinced , if james madison said that almost 250 years ago , it must be right . 
  the us policy on gmo is practically monsanto 's policy on gmo , that 's why it makes no sense if you 're looking at it from any other perspective . 
  qatar , for a country that has less population than most major cities in europe is an economic powerhouse . 
  i think you choose a really poor example . 
  i 'm pretty sure he means gdp per capita , because obviously the countries with the highest population will have the highest gdp most of the time . 
  the netherlands has a much higher gdp per capita than spain . 
  well he already said the referendum will happen , merkel and hollande do n't want to give cameron an out on it . 
  he ca n't back out of it now , it would be the end of his political career , he backed himself into a corner , now he has to deal with it . 
   you say europe has had enough of the attitude of british citizens . 
  which is pretty much true , there 's only so much one can take of the special snowflake routine . 
   your statement is incompatible with a successful european union . 
  the eu can not function if unless people learn to abandon their nationalist prejudices . 
  something tells me you have no idea what nationalist really means , if you think i 'm one . 
  nothing i said in this thread is even close to nationalism . 
   i do n't know whether you consider yourself pro or anti eu , but your impact on the eu , such as it is , is about as helpful as the ukipper who rails against french bureaucracy . 
  i 'm so glad you can judge my impact on the eu , when by your own words you have no clue what my position on the eu even is . 
  cognitive dissonance much ? 
   the way you talk about british citizens is one of the two big problems with the eu . 
  please elaborate , because right now your post is somewhere between `` what the fuck does that mean ? '', 
  and irrelevance . 
   any debate should be held on its own merits ; and certainly should not be influenced by nationality . 
  okay ... what debate is that ? 
  you can start making sense any moment now . 
   the day you reject an argument because it 's british , comes from the british government or represents british citizens ; that 's the day the eu dream dies in you and the platitudes just keep on coming , you 're a walking cliche . 
  neither merkel or hollande have any obligation to do cameron any favors , which is exactly what they would have if they played along with this moronic survey . 
  as for the british citizens , well ... the go along to get along attitude has n't helped the other eu members yet when it comes to the british citizens , britain whines and asks for special rights and exceptions on a regular basis , compromise is n't fun when only one side is doing it , the rest of europe had enough of it . 
  i did n't mean that his intentions were n't good and honest , just misguided , just like trickle down economics . 
  the eu needs to become a full fiscal union , if it does n't than the eurozone and probably the entire eu will collapse . 
  germany needs to make up its mind , because it ca n't have its cake and eat it too . 
  the current currency union without the fiscal union is doomed to fail . 
  first time i agree with milton friedman on anything , but wow was he on the money on this one . 
  the north will be forced to give money because if they wo n't the eurozone will collapse , that 's actually not a if , it 's a when . 
  it 's economics 101 . 
  last time somebody had this idea of organized society in europe , romania ended up in a world war , followed by over 50 years are communist dictatorship . 
  things were really organized during communism let me tell you . 
  i 'll take the chaos of diversity over your moronic one size fits all method of problem solving . 
  so ... basically everybody should shut up and do what you say ? 
  got it . 
  personally i think i 'll pass on the fascism , which is why i 'm now very much against romania joining the eurozone until the severe flaws in the euro are fixed , and with people like you on the other side that will probably take at least 20-30 years . 
  i 'm not saying it 's their fault for anything , what i am saying is that if they want the euro to function and survive wealth transfers are needed , there 's no other way . 
  the same thing happens in the us , rich states pay more to the federal government than they receive and the poor states receive more from the federal government than they pay . 
  it 's not a question of fault , it 's a question of what needs to be done for the euro to survive . 
  the problem does not refer to the eu , it 's strictly in the eurozone , and what the eu does is nowhere near enough to make up for the wealth imbalances in the eurozone . 
  nordic eurozone countries have to make wealth transfers to southern eurozone countries to make up for the eurozone trade imbalance and loss of competitiveness . 
  what you 're talking about has nothing to do with it , but thanks for playing . 
  the euro as it 's currently built ca n't last . 
  what nordic politicians know and knew for years is that for the eurozone to function in a sustainable fashion nordic countries will have to make wealth transfers to the south to make up for the completely loopsided trade balance , of course that part they never told their own people . 
  wow that 's a stupid looking passport , the bold eagle and the start of the constitution ... so so lame . 
  ot : the worst he seems to cry about is that the adoptive mother was nagging him , that 's nowhere near enough for me to agree with him . 
  this seems like a case of pretty old adopted child ( 13 is pretty old for an adoption ) that could n't bond with the adoptive parents or the american culture . 
  no , that 's not at all what a cyprus euro would be . 
  cyprus euros are only euros in cypriot banks , while in cash form they are normal euros , since you can remove them from the cypriot economy . 
  the euros in the cypriot banks ca n't be removed from the cypriot economy because of the capital controls , that 's the whole point . 
  except you also have most of your money blocked in those same banks , but even if you magically have a bag full of euros in cash , at that point , you do n't have cyprus euros , you 'll have eurozone euros . 
  cyprus euros are n't described as cash euros that are in cyprus , but euros that are in cypriot banks , subject to the capital controls , as most of the money in cyprus is , or do you think people hold millions of euros in their homes ? 
  what i think you mean , and in that sense you are right , but that holds true in almost all cases , is that people that have access to liquidity ( in this specific case , literally cash on hand ) are in a very good position to make good deals . 
  but like i said , that 's almost always true . 
  cash is king . 
  you 're kidding right ? 
  higher value due to scarcity ? 
  what do you think this is , gold ? 
  people that have money in banks in cyprus wo n't be able to withdraw more than 100 euros per day , or whatever they final decide on . 
  blocked money is useless , money only has value if you can actually use it . 
  you 're hilarious . 
  well , there has been nothing but doom and gloom for the past 5 years , especially in europe .

  [ i dunno what to say about that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vtdgb03pk4 ) ... 
   the problem is , the stolen-wealth theory is wrong . 
    oh , it 's absolutely true that colonial powers stole natural resources from the lands they conquered . 
  no one disputes that . 
  and at the time , this definitely made the colonized regions a lot poorer . 
    it 's also probably true that this stolen wealth helped much of the west get rich .

  nope , not in an ad infinitum .

  ------------------------------------------------------------------ a romanian , a hungarian and a gypsy were all fishing on a lake . 
  somehow , their rods catch the same fish , a golden fish . 
  the fish says : \\ - since all of you caught me , i 'll grant only one wish to each one of you . 
  \\ - i want all hungarians be/feel at home , each one of them wealthy & happy , ^ says ^ the ^ hungarian . 
  the hungarian - poof - disappears . 
  \\ - i want all gypsies be/feel at home , each one of them wealthy & happy , ^ says ^ the ^ gypsy .

  \\ - so , ^ the ^ romanian ^ asks , the hungarians and gypsies , all of them , are back to their * homelands * , wealthy & happy ? 
  \\ - yes , hungarians and gypsies are back to their * homelands * , wealthy and happy . 
  the romanian looks at the gold fish , releases it and says goodbye . 
  the gold fish is somewhat surprised and asks : \\ - are n't you going to wish something too ? 
  \\ - well , ^ says ^ the ^ romanian , i 'd wish for a coca-cola but you already granted me two wishes . 
  * there are more `` tainted '' ones but , as of now , it 's enough . 
  we 're world champions at hypocrisy & wrangle . 
  after the plane lands , people start clapping . 
  before the plane takes off , people do the cross . 
  we 're world champions at hypocrisy & wrangle . 
  for example , we condemn hunting wild boars but have no problem gutting domestic pigs , let them agonize , gather their blood in a basin ( for sausages , obviously ) , and then comfort ourselves that this is better than buying `` that rubber from foreign supermarkets , and eat real meat '' . 
  another example ... we condemn parliament for all the woes ( some justifiable , to be fair ) the nation is going through but there 's a catch : that parliament , for better or worse , was voted by masses of people . 
  you got that ? 
  the hypocrisy here is this : most romanians do not vote to exercise their right to choose , but to have a scapegoat the second minute for any problem they may and will have . 
  those officials , corrupt or not , did n't forced their way to those positions , they were voted in . 
  some of my conationals might argue : `` yeah , but they 're the only ones , we want a new political class '' . 
  the are three ways to achieve that : one , kill a lot of them ( blood vengeance ) ; two , do not vote them at all or vote a minority party , there 's no excuse ; three , wait and expect their offsprings to get into their dads ' & moms ' positions within the mainstream parties . 
  `` during new times , it 's still us '' as the saying goes . 
  another example ... we blame ourselves for social , spiritual ( soul ) & economical `` illnesses '' , we 'd favor a foreigner than one of our own ( the dictator mentality is still prevalent , as envy still strives , sadly ) , but when that foreigner proves to be another son-of-a-whore shill that made us some counterproductive results , we blame soros , the ngos , the nwo , cabal etc. 
  ; yet not realise that xenophilia is not at all a positive recipe to remake a country in every way . 
  oh well , `` the german/french/japanese / etc. 
  knows what he does [ best ] '' . 
  another example ... we curse , we blame , we invoke the heavens & hell to act against somebody we do n't like * buuuuuut * ... god forbid that we 'd wish that person to die . 
  it 's something among the lines : `` i do n't curse you , but i wish upon you/your family that heaven & hell < * write the misfortune here *  '' . 
  or if it 's a corrupt official : `` i wish that bastard the evils & misfortunes of the world againt him/her . 
  death ? 
  no , no , no , i do n't wish death upon anyone '' . 
  see , lack of bloodthirst ( even justifiable , ffs !, 
  ) , yet no problems to other grievousnesses . 
  another example ... christmas carols & singers . 
  i do n't mind christmas carols but they 've become psychologically harmful , at least to me . 
  they take advantage over a series of emotions ( again , you might be caught offguard , even if you 're ice-cold ) , sing a carol or two , then expect money or other goods . 
  * * that . 
  * that 's begging & tainting something that is considered ... uhmm ... fuck it , i only get angry more and i do n't want to . 
  another example ... this one is fairly stupid and it involves the old saying `` beggars ca n't be choosers '' . 
  let 's say a corrupt official is arrested , condemned , sent to jail , and after a while , released . 
  however , that official would not have any problems if the voting season started and here 's why : even though he/she stole , `` he/she did something to our town '' . 
  do you understand the rhetoric ? 
  `` i know that he/she steals , like the ones before him/her , but he/she actually did ` some ' things in our town . 
  another example ... democracy sold via mail & its perversion . 
  the expats , which i myself am ( i try my best to not be hypocrite ) , do not - i repeat - *** do not *** pay any taxes or imposts to the country of origin 's national budget , yet many of these dimwitted half-assed degenerate morons want voting rights within the country of origin 's political stage . 
  in other words , a romanian living & working in italy , that pays taxes & imposts to the italian budget ^ ** !, 
  ** , wants voting rights for the romanian political stage , to which he/she *** does n't *** contribute a single coin to the romanian budget , but has no problems paying for the italian budget . 
  * again , this is a random example , i could 've brought any country which a romanian expatriated diaspora exists * . 
  do you understand ? 
  these idiots want voting rights on somebody else 's taxed/imposted money . 
  i , as an expat , do not pay any taxes or imposts to the romanian national budget , i only pay taxes & imposts to the country i currently reside in , and do not want to be considered a burden/parasite to the rest within the country [ of origin ] , voting on their money . 
  however ... 
  i 'm but just one exception per the thousand ( s ) ... not only that this is hipocrisy , it 's downright fraudulent extorted blackmail with a white mask to hide these stab-in-the-back vices . 
  some of these hipocrites , with sporadic audacity , as if the logic is n't self-evident by now , argue that `` we send money in the country '' ; specifically , to their mommy , daddy and/or wifey | hubby . 
  did you catch that fallacy ? 
  they actually believe that sending money to these persons , of whom the moron associates with , thinks he/she contributes his/her fair share to the national budget . 
  however , given that not all of us are idiots , there 's a grave , grave error to that mindset , a big fallacious , diarrhea mindset : the money , which the idiot `` sends into the country '' , are spent on taxes & imposts of which *** mommy , daddy and/or wifey | hubby are already obligated , by default , to pay on their own behalf , as per individual , *** yet the moron does n't pay * his/her own personal , per individual , * taxes & imposts to the national budget , but has no problems throwing hissy fits for voting rights . 
  newsflash , according to logic : ask for voting rights to the authority to which you pay your taxes & imposts . 
  but that ... that takes , apparently , great mental aptitudes to figure it out ; this rudimentary fact of reason . 
  i could go on but i honestly do n't want my inbox to explode with * their * idiocy . 
  it 's enough that i shed some light on these issues . 
  you say it in such a way that one might believe you 're insinuating they - the owners - are inherently evil for not abandoning their only place to live , even if it 's a red-code disaster if an earthquake hits . 
  and if it 'll happen , it 'll happen , nothing we or anybody else could do to prevent a natural occurence , deadly as it is .

  my two biggest problems are these : 1 ) this law is n't original nor unique . 
  it was , at best , a `` look at others how they did , we should copy + paste them '' . 
  classic self-hating xenophilia . 
  2 ) this , from economics101 , is grievously intrusive : as the business owner , you want to have as much clients as you can get ( besides , you pay taxes and knowing our system here , is awful but that 's another topic ) , how else but to accept their own consumerist relaxation habits such as smoking & drinking alcohol . 
  but no , with this law , this will affect bussinesses greatly . 
  some restaurants have smoking and non-smoking areas , others do n't , what can you do but choose , you are n't forced to go where you do n't want to , are you ? 
  of course , all hail government , big daddy , big brother , only he can protect you from yourself , freedom is slavery , and who 'll build the roads other than the government ... what a sick irony , compared to what happened for 45 years + 26 recent years .

  the idea is that for every euro i get , the state gets x cents . 
  also i was n't referring to income tax but all the taxes associated with an individual work contract , pensions , health , unemployment , work associated risk fund etc. 
  no sure how is your bacalhou but i am not that keen on fish . 
  i eat it , but i do n't like usually the after taste . 
  i did a simulation for a salary of 1000 euros net , and for that sum the state gets 750 euro ... the burden for a tipical minimum wage is around 63 % and it goes up to 55 % if you have some social particularities like more than 4 kids etc. 
  even for it which do n't pay income tax , the rate still is around 47 % , but they are an exception . 
  dream job of the future , half of the planet will comment and the other half will filter what they comment  ), 
  tax evasion is a problem . 
  i am thinking about my country , economic boom or somewhere inbetween the lines , but we can barely raise taxes at around 25 % of gdp , while most europe is at around 35 % + . 
  mostly because of the generalized tax evasion and underground economy ... 
  in romania , work taxes are around 75 % of net income ( but the burden is split between employer and employee ) . 
   stronk europe tank challenge say thanks romanian 's were n't there !, 
  and we do n't have a mbt !,

  debatable ... 
  btw who produces axn 's crossing lines series ? 
  fair and cheap would be that the quota to be at a european level . 
  meaning that in romania the 20 % to be formed by movies / tv series from all europe ... not 20 % romanian content ... : /, 
  it is already regulated , they want harmonization . 
  or the next smthexit, 
  cause media is a product and like all products in the single market , the rules should be the same in every corner of the market . 
  also this is why they try to reach a consensus . 
  no , but most membership is eu . 
  ok , but what about being part of the new eu army project , is that compatible with your constitution , public consensus ? 
   if turkey succeeds . 
  as if the rest of the ** european ** countries would give in to turkey shenanigans ...

  they were people brought from the whole country , urban and rural , people from some state owned companies that were given free day to go to the protest . 
  psd wanted a rally and they had it and since they did n't really try to hide the facts it , people were more amused than angered . 
  nop , i am also very sad how the whole financial crises ended ... recommend mark blyth on the subject . 
  people were asked by the media and they confessed after which local psd leaders also did n't hide the fact anymore . 
  it was a political rally and people were incentivized to come , waste a day of their lives and travel several hundred km to the capital . 
  this is what they did in the states with the bank shitty assets . 
  the fed to the toxic assets and shoved them in a big dark whole in its balance sheet .

  sensible topic i know , but did n't expect to get downvoted this much , since my heart is in the right place , 
  for the social democrats in romania , during their last rallies people were paid  ) or how they like to call it : politically incentivized . 
  yes ... all countries have this ... france has it , romania has it , hungary has it , uk has it and the list could go on an on . 
   edit : i expect this getting downvoted to hell . 
  not on my watch !, 
  what differences ? 
  so they do n't want to share money . 
  i see ... well in all countries there are rich areas and poor areas , and despite efforts the poor get always financed by the others . 
  also the same system happens at an individual level through welfare ... tbh not sure how to fight that with arguments . 
  they were saying that this is a state coup . 
  also one of the `` specialist '' of the panel in one of the shows who now acts as a lawyer for corrupt politicians but was previously in law enforcement , said repeatedly that it was a situation in which the police could be justified in opening fire with war munition on the protestors since this was a clandestine operation to overthrown the democratic elected government . 
  it was utter shit show , i could n't even stand to watch , but the headlines and breaking news tags stormed the internet . 
  the positive thing is that people took this with humor and started bringing more personal dogs with different posters handing on the dogs with hilarious messages . 
  also , in response to people 's complains and threat of boycott some corporation withdrew their advertising from those tv channels . 
  yes , a fair question ... 
  i understand it very well . 
  you are marginalizing the events and the reasoning behind the protests , by attacking the fact that the protests were also encouraged by the whole civil society , hence also ngos funded by soros , which is a fact i ca n't dismiss . 
   ) / sorry could n't resist :p yep maybe they can find a common ground and guide us to the light . 
  romanian puppy ? 
   ) new tag puppies of europe lol, 
  the ball is starting to roll it seems ... whatever that may mean ... 
  lolz , so we should fk off and suck it up from corrupt politicians just cause someone might influence a critical mass of sorts ?!, 
  you are using a strawman argument . 
  no one would have cared protesting if they would n't have passed that ordinance . 
  basically the ecb has to buy new greek tbills at a 10y or more maturity date . 
  15b , well they could also buy the 12b from the imf as they tend to complicate more the negotiations . 
  but what is the real reason they want separation ? 
  you ca n't win an argument with him . 
  it 's tribalism 101 . just like rotterdam people would want independence of amsterdam cause their port is bigger . 
  catalans were never spaniards they are a different people subjugated by the spanish empire . 
  time they get their freedom !, 
  no , cause it would not have any legal meaning . 
  it will be just shit show and nothing else . 
  how ? 
  will the french buy all the state owned companies ? 
  will they buy some islands and make some tourism or even a military base ? 
  we did n't protest for ngos , for soros , for universities etc. 
  we protested against changes in the penal law and against amnesty law for incarcerated people . 
  the ngos did n't really participate the people just got scared on fb and flooded the streets . 
  are there ngos in romania , ofc . 
  had they anything to do with anti corruption protests ? 
  hardly . 
  exactly my point . 
  i gave an exact reference so people can understand how some romanian news station operate as a whole . 
  cringe media ... 
  mistake or uk usa difference ? 
  do you even know why did we protest in romania ? 
  when we had our massive protests in january / february the government controled news media , basically our fox and friends , said that over 100.000 people where payed to protest , and that the payment scheme involved paying participants 10 euro more if they bring their dog and 20 euro if they bring their infants . 
  ofc everything was payed directly by soros through its ngos . 
  this really enraged people and even more protested the following days / weeks . 
  yes the only solution . 
  triage centers in respective countries ... 
  we did n't choose ... we were forced . 
  cause and sudden effect . 
  yep like in romania , soros payed for the dogs and the babies ... 
   ) heard trump gon na make a dyson sphere around mexico , type 2 also around the corner  ),

  people do n't give a fuck and that 's how xenophobia spreads . 
   `` it 's very likely he was an immigrant because the police are keeping quiet about the identity '' and how is that not the same thing ? 
  the fact is you do n't know . 
  and you 're still blaming someone . 
   i think it 's quite possible actually . 
  but that 's a very different argument to your xenophobic one . 
  of course they 're different . 
  tell that to those that blame it on immigrants . 
   modern capitalism interacting with the third world is giving birth to new , often horrific , cultural trends that we ca n't predict this is true . 
  but this has always been true with all cultures . 
  not just modern versus third world cultures . 
  people use this idea to blame immigrants and that 's bad . 
  there are literally people i 've talked with here that say that it 's `` very likely '' he was an immigrant because of this . 
  that 's a xenophobic stereotype . 
   copycat killer is a term used for serial killers . 
  this is gang violence are you saying that it 's impossible for someone to copy violent attacks unless it 's murder ? 
  really ? 
  is this your argument ? 
  people do this all the time in order to blame immigrants . 
  people copy groups they hate in order to blame things on them . 
  it 's been going on since people started forming groups . 
   what you seem unable to acknowledge is that the rise in acid attacks in other parts of the world , has a direct correlation with the rise in acid attacks in london and the uk . 
  ** correlation does not imply causation . 
  ** this discussion is over . 
   are you saying that it 's xenophobic to even say that the delay is there ? 
  i 'm saying that `` it 's very likely he was an immigrant '' is xenophobic . 
   and the police immediately identified the suspect as white , along with a photograph . 
  and this time he 's a teenager . 
  have you considered that they 're doing this because he 's a teenager ? 
  so why are you blaming middle eastern and african immigrants if romanians are `` the most criminal foreigners '' ? 
  that also sounds a lot like xenophobia . 
  not that you guy love us a lot . 
  that 's far from it . 
  are you guys bored of hating romanians ? 
   very likely , yeah . 
  bro , that 's how xenophobia works . 
  `` very likely '' is bs and quickly turns to `` he was an immigrant ! '', 
  even after it was proved that he was n't . 
  the last acid attack in london was made by a white uk born male . 
  how many people do you think know this ? 
  how many do you think that blame it on immigrants because of the `` very likely '' rhetoric ? 
  a lot . 
  right now we do n't know . 
  if we 're to look at recent attacks , it 's actually `` very likely '' that it was n't an immigrant . 
  saying this is also wrong . 
   acid attacks gained popularity there , and this has come to london through the respective immigrant communities . 
  so when a white uk born male does it , it 's the fault of african `` culture '' because they did it first . 
  is that right ? 
   i was n't even saying as an anti-immigrant statement as well , i was just pointing out that things that happen in the 3rd world as irrevocably linked to things that happen in the west . 
  have you ever heard of copycat killers ? 
   they do n't hide the identity like this when it 's a white british guy . 
  because if it was an immigrant who attacked another immigrant to steal his bike , he was clearly trying to undermine british law and culture and they do n't want people to know that . 
  yep . 
  makes sense . 
   it always takes longer to get anything done when you 've got 27 people in a room you need to get to agree to a plan compared to just one . 
  they also have more to offer as a union . 
  also , if judging by how fast the brexit negotiations are going , you can safely say that speed is n't uk strong point . 
  and the eu is obligated to negotiate with them . 
   because what nation would be interested in doing a trade deal with the world 's fifth largest economy ? 
  5th for how long ? 
  also 5th only on the nominal gdp ranking . 
  on the gdp by ppp ranking the uk is 9th . 
  germany is 5th . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp )  no you do n't , stop lying . 
  you literally spend all your time posting `` see i told you so '' responses to anything to do with brexit . 
  i 'm sorry you see it like that . 
  i 'm just being realistic . 
  and uk people really need a dose of realism to escape tabloid propaganda that has suffocated them for years . 
  as long as people willingly do this , i agree . 
   juncker leaked details about a private conversation and then was forced to apologise for it . 
  uk tabloids took his quote out of context . 
   it was a `` serious mistake '' to leak details of his private dinner with theresa may , jean-claude juncker has admitted , but the eu commission president has denied he was behind the information getting out . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ean-claude-juncker-disastrous-dinner-theresa-may-brexit-serious-mistake-downing-street-a7728216.html so they did n't leak it and it was a serious mistake . 
  how do you jump from that to `` juncker leaked details about a private conversation and then was forced to apologise for it '' ? 
  i 'll tell you how . 
  his quote was taken out of context by uk tabloids and you did n't bother to fact check it . 
   your comment has 46 points despite a complete lie . 
  no , dude , you 're the one lying . 
  you 've been mislead by tabloid propaganda and you 're now spreading it to others that take your word for it without fact checking it . 
   you were saying ? 
  what 's interesting is how many upvotes you got . 
  the eu did n't leak it . 
  below is the first paragraph from your own article . 
   but eu commission president denies he was behind the leak the eu releases comprehensive reports , not 5 pm dinner discussions that the uk tabloids can spin however they want . 
  there 's a big difference between a leak and an official report . 
  that dinner and the reporting for it was the incident that prompted the eu to start releasing public reports on the negotiations so that shit reports like those never happen again . 
   if it was n't immigrants , they would have said so and made that clear . 
  so it 's immigrants because they did n't say it was immigrants . 
  is that it ? 
   there are more than enough incidents in legit newsoutlets to see a pattern . 
  true . 
  and the pattern is called xenophobia . 
   the point that / u/kingofeggsandwiches was trying to make is that this form of acid attack to the face is common in pakistan so it must have clearly been a pakistani immigrant , because only they can do it , right ? 
  anyone can write a shitty opinion piece article that has little to no factual evidence but lots of fear mongering . 
  the fact that the author is `` legit '' or not is irrelevant . 
  you 're supposed to read and comment on the article based on what the article actually says . 
   when the impact of inflation is factored in , real weekly wages fell by 0.5 % compared with a year earlier . 
  is it safe to assume that more low wage people got hired ? 
  trump 's fake hair looks like it 's dancing to the beat . 
  someone should make an equalizer app from the footage .

  we had protests in romania as well , but they were conducted in front of israel 's embassy . 
  yes , i agree , europe seems to be a little more objective when it comes to the israeli-palestinian conflict . 
  america on the other hand ... jeez . 
  look , i agree , hamas sucks . 
  however , i will say this - few countries would have gotten away if they were in israel 's shoes . 
  [ the young turks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-uwmxbkoxs&amp;list=uu1ybkrugpc1tsm73a0zjyjq&amp;index=4 ) made some comments with which i totally agree . 
  maybe one of them got torn down since then . 
  i never heard that shithead speak english until now . 
  he has such a thick russian accent . 
  economically speaking , ukraine is in deep shit . 
  it 's true that taking the western path might be much better in the long-term , but short to medium-term they are fucked even if this conflict de-escalates . 
  ukraine and russia 's economies are simply too intertwined to be ripped apart so suddenly . 
  russia 's economy will suffer as well , but we are talking about a 170 billion economy versus a 2 trillion one . 
  5 billion $ wo n't have the same impact on the later as it will have on the former . 
   ukraine already posted nearly a 15 % drop in gdp for first quarter of 2014 would you be so kind to provide a link ? 
  i 'm quite interested . 
  personally , i do n't like bucharest very much and i expect sofia to be similar . 
  i know next to nothing abut istanbul , so no comments there . 
  however , budapest is a must - it 's a gorgeous city . 
  also , you said you like nature and history , so you should dedicate a big chunk of your trip to visiting transylvania . 
  the carpathian mountains are quite spectacular and we also have some kick-ass castles and fortresses . 
  the danube delta is another cool place for nature-lovers . 
  it has the biggest variety of plants and animals in europe , i believe . 
  poor thing ... that [ stare ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thousand-yard_stare ) at the very end of the video ... it cut right trough me . 
  does anybody know . . ? 
  is there any way to donate some money for the people of sloviansk ? 
  i know the daily mail is shit , so you might be right , i do n't know . 
  however , i was just trying to make a point that romania is no mexico , quite the opposite , it is one of the safest countries in the world . 
   anyway , it 's safe to assume someone called ukipper has a pretty clear agenda and can be safely ignored . 
  again , you are right . 
  unfortunately , i have n't noticed his name . 
  you are joking , right ? 
  high crime rate and criminal gangs ? 
  in fucking romania ? 
  sure , there are a few hard-ass moneylenders , but romania ai n't no bronx . 
  there are no gangs here . 
  there are more violent crimes in britain than in any other eu country . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1196941/the-violent-country-europe-britain-worse-south-africa-u-s.html ) romania is safer because the crime rate is lower than in the uk . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/crime/rankings_by_country.jsp ) the only index in which romania ranked lower than britain is the homicide rate . 
  that 's because of moldovan villagers who kill each other while drunk because they remembered some old dispute that they have . 
  the uk has a rate of 1 homicide per 100.000 people per year and romania has a rate of 1.7 ( similar to canada ) . 
  still , this rate is among the lowest in the world . 
  let me give you some examples of other countries : lithuania - 6.7 , usa - 4.8 , russia - 9.2 , south africa - 31 , venezuela - 53.7 . 
   likely gas price increases , and more import restrictions , moldova could definitely be in for a painful few years . 
  not necessarily . 
  moldova will actually get a much better deal as romania will start selling gas to moldova this summer at a bargain price ( they also say the rate will increase and moldova will be energetically independent from russia in a matter of years ) . 
  also , let 's not forget that the european market is much larger than the russian one and moldova will now have easy access to it . 
  sure , it will not be a smooth ride as russia is their biggest trading partner at the moment , but let 's be optimistic . 
  i 'm sorry for my pedantry , but that map is not right at all . 
  the median wage in romania is n't 176 euros , it 's about 500 ( after taxes ) . 
  it ca n't even be 176 because the minimum wage is 900 lei ( 205 eur ) . 
  full ranking [ here .

  i agree with you that euromaidanpress.com is a propaganda site . 
  however , you are the one acting like a dick mate , not the other guy . 
  the problem is that people generalize too much . 
  we 've all seen the ignorant '' ` murica '' type of american or the royal british twats like the guy you are arguing with . 
  unfortunately , people like this stand out the most and we tend to generalize and associate that type of behavior with entire nations . 
  yeah , i know . 
  i am still missing the joke however . 
  yeah , i remember vicky . 
   what is it ? 
  please tell me , i 'm white ( jk ) . 
  i 'm quite certain he is joking . 
  edit : it seems he is n't joking . 
   actually per kilometer , romanian motorways seem to be more dangerous . 
  i was n't implying they were safer . 
  i was just saying that i do n't really know if the speed limit affects safety or not . 
  also , the reason why romania is doing so well in the statistics per inhabitant is not because normal roads are classified as motorways but because we have so few kilometers of motorway . 
  i 've known about stephen merchant and i like him quite a lot . 
  however , until this moment i have n't noticed his strong pronunciation of `` r '' . 
  wow !, 
  haha !, 
  i nailed it . 
  :d also , this is quite interesting . 
  thank you . 
   first , according to many linguists , the romanian language ( in the wider sense ) is already divided into four dialects : daco-romanian , aromanian , megleno-romanian , and istro-romanian ; these , according to other linguists , are separate languages . 
  i , myself , would n't say so , but it appears that you are right . 
  some linguists think they are separate languages . 
   while the 500 speakers of istro-romanian would probably be understood in romania , especially in transylvania ( the official romanian dialect is more distant ) . 
  they are better understood in moldova than in transylvania as there are more slavic influences there . 
  no worries . 
  i know that accent . 
  sounds very much like the pirate accent . 
  quite funny , indeed . 
  i am familiar with all of them except the bristol one . 
  i never knew there was a bristol accent . 
   is pretty damn hard to be understood even by people from the center of the country yes , well , regionalisms are one thing and i might not be able to understand all of them , however the accent itself is n't hard to understand or even reproduce by people living in central romania . 
  i , myself , am for central transylvania and your accent does n't differ all that much from ours . 
   not from our country you are right , but they still speak romanian , a different dialect from ours , but still romanian . 
  really ? 
  i would n't say it 's weird , nor is it terribly funny . 
  the funniest accent ( in my opinion ) is the moldovan accent . 
  have you ever heard a moldovan tell a joke ? 
  it makes it 10 times funnier for some reason . 
  and the weirdest accents / dialects are istro-romanian , megleno-romanian and aromanian . 
  average romanians ca n't even understand what it 's being said . 
  i quite envy you . 
  i do n't know if it 's a good thing to not have any speed limit on the motorway , because in my mind , even 1 life saved is worth having a speed limit . 
  however , i usually drive home from my parents ' house in the evening and the motorway is completely empty , yet i 'm stuck at 130 .

  it used to be more than 10 % some years ago ( around 30 % in 2006 ) , around 10 % in the last years . 
  no , it will not be more expensive for romania . 
  romanian gas is cheaper than what we were/are importing from russia . 
  several romanian gas-hungry fertilizer factories have closed in romania and this led to further cuts in gas imports . 
  we have many things of value . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  romania is richer than crimea or the territories they invaded in eastern ukraine . 
  the main reason for the decrease of imports from russia is the closing down of a number of gas-hungry factories , especially fertilizer ones . 
  `` based on the pristine condition of so many dacian coins and artifacts , deppert-lippitz argues that the dacians had no concept of money . '', 
  this is just not true . 
  there is ample evidence that the dacians were using money/coins to trade , including with their neighbors . 
  there are hundreds of discoveries of coins throughout the territory of dacia and , in any case , it would be foolish to believe that in the 1st century ad people living in europe would not know how to use coins when all their neighbors were doing that . 
  i 'm surprised this sort of nonsense was allowed into the article . 
  we have a small tatar minority in romania , mostly living in the dobruja region ( between the danube and the black sea ) . 
  :-) sure . 
  have a good reading !, 
  i see . 
  look , i 'm not saying that everything friedman says is wrong , he obviously also has some good arguments , but he puts too much of an emphasis on geography , and this can distort his analyses . 
  then , there are much better and more informed analyst/thinkers on europe than he is . 
  geopolitics is only one of the approaches to international affairs , one that offers quite narrow answers . 
  international relations ( ir ) is a much wider and more complex field of science . 
  you can start reading the wikipedia article about it http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_relations foreign policy analysis also offers good insights into how states behave http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_policy_analysis now , besides this academic part , in terms of analysis of current events , i would recommend you to read the product of ( foreign affairs ) think tanks . 
  as i see you are polish , here are two institutions from poland which do decent work on eastern europe ( and not only ) http://www.osw.waw.pl/ http://www.pism.pl/en#1 there are many more think tanks . 
  you can find some good ones at page 30 in this ranking of think tanks http://gotothinktank.com/dev1/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/gotoreport2013.pdf, 
  congrats for moving so quickly . 
  now create a land bridge to the uk :-), 
  what foreign affairs issues interest you ? 
  the answer would depend on that . 
  also try to have a wider look on international affairs that the view offered by `` geopolitics '' . 
  stratfor is certainly not the greatest of sources to understand today 's world . 
  they have a fairly good reputation in the media but are not really a respected institution in the foreign policy community . 
  american tourists are welcome . 
  nobody 's your rival . 
  it would be good to stop using those big brushes to describe things . 
  what a crappy message . 
  i am transylvanian myself , but , probably different from you , i actually lived in bucharest for several years and it 's certainly the city in romania that offers the most to its inhabitants , in terms of economic opportunities , standard of life , education , culture , you name it . 
  sure , it has many parts which are not ` pretty ' but there are many parts in romania which are uglier , including in transylvania . 
  it is expensive compared to what ? 
  it is the richest city in romania so yes , for somebody from outside of bucharest it 's expensive . 
  guess what , paris is also expensive for non-parisians . 
  travel a bit around the world and then talk to us about kitschy . 
  and really , all the undesirables of romanian society gathered in bucharest ? 
  does that mean that our transylvania is now some ` paradise on earth ' ? 
  `` corrupt '' ? 
  like you can find that only in bucharest . 
  where the f *** is sorin apostu , the mayor of cluj , the capital of transylvania ? 
  i 'm sure he 's in jail for corruption as tens and tens of other transylvanian politicians/mayors and other people . 
  so cut us some slack about other places being corrupt . 
  nothing makes me more ashamed of some of my fellow transylvanians that this crappy and immature arrogance and attitude of superiority towards the other regions of the country and bucharest in particular . 
  i would recommend you to try to find some other reasons to feel good about yourself than shitting down on your fellow countrymen . 
  can you give any example to support this ? 
  most civil society organisations support their work and the european commission has a lot of words of praise for its activity . 
  they managed to pursue quite a lot of cases . 
  the guy is investigated for something regarding his former role , not his current one . 
  sorry but those are nothing compared to what the russian dash cams are delivering . 
  a few risky overtakes , some undecided drivers and that 's all . 
  it could as well be italy if not for the shitty weather . 
  walking to the grocery store in russia brings more adrenaline than this compilation . 
  i would not go into any such comparisons . 
  vlad the impaler was pretty much an absolute ruler who used abusive and very violent methods to get rid of opponents or other political competition . 
  the dna chief prosecutor is in charge of a team of prosecutors who apply the criminal code and face a lot of legal constraints ( most of them necessary ) , as well as political and media pressure . 
  if vlad the impaler did n't like some boyar he would order for him to be killed . 
  if the romanian parliament does n't want to approve the continuation of the legal process against one of the mps , that legal process does not continue and that mp can safely continue his political ( and criminal ) career . 
  so the dna chief prosecutor does n't even have the power to prevent political abuse of the justice system . 
  yes , that is one of their ` specialties ' , but not kidnapping . 
  i 've read similar stories in another newspaper several months ago . 
  this is just another newspaper looking into it but the actual information is not new . 
  i do n't have time to look for it now but you can find the info on the internet . 
  who do they kidnap ? 
  most of the times romanian/roma criminals commit petty crimes , begging , pick-pocketing and burglaries , with a very low number of violent crimes . 
  though we get many pieces of news about romanians misbehaving outside the county , i have n't heard about this kidnapping thing . 
  are you sure that you are not just repeating a known stereotype about gypsies/roma ( stealing children etc. 
  that is false . 
  the information that the rebels had captured buk systems already existed in the media . 
  it 's true , it was n't very visible but people following the conflict knew about this . 
  the ukrainian authorities should have warned air companies about this and those companies should have had better risk assessment . 
  this is not to excuse russia , they are the ones responsible for that heinous crime , but it 's not like the other parties did n't do any mistakes . 
  we already knew this . 
  villagers have talked to the press before , confirmed that the rocked flew from next to their village . 
  are you for real ? 
  the pact already exists ( read nato ) . 
  most probably the osd is from the original signal but i see that in the upper right corner there is `` elo '' written ( with and accent on ` e ' and an umlaut on ` o ' ) and that is certainly not romanian ( or english ) ; the word is not romanian and we do n't use either accents or umlauts . 
  it does n't matter anyway , it 's not an important issue . 
  thanks but both of the examples/errors you provided do n't seem to be made by romanians . 
  in the first one , the text to the left is written in hungarian ( correct me if i 'm wrong ) and the lower right side it 's written bukarest , which is also hungarian for bucharest . 
  the second example is not from a romanian television . 
  could it be m1 , a hungarian tv ? 
  though i assume they are were not the ones mixing the flags . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m1_%28tv_channel%29 i 'm not saying that romanians ca n't mix the hungarian flag but as / oblio - says below , the hungarian flag is quite visible in the romanian media so it 's not that easy to mix with the italian one . 
  thus i was curious about this . 
  thanks for looking . 
  have a good week . 
  that was not a good idea . 
  i mean , the euro is suppose to unite us europeans so let 's not start putting celebrations/commemorations of battles in which we killed each other . 
  `` one diplomat expressed surprise that `` two centuries later a proposal for some loose change with an image of a hill on it can cause such a fuss in paris , '' our correspondent adds . '', 
  well , that diplomat does n't know much about history , its symbolism and its significance . 
  i 'm with the french on this one . 
  `` in bucharest , steinmeier was unpleasantly surprised by his romanian counterpart bogdan aurescu , who presented him with a momorable brochure marking the 135th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries . '', 
  and `` romanian authorities apologized immediately , explaining that it was a technical mistake . 
  aurescu also apologized personally to steinmeier , who replied that he had n't noticed the mistake . '',

  i 'm obviously joking but after i 've read about the clusterfuck that was the berlin airport i have become way more cynical . . 
  this . 
  always this with the russians . 
  it translates to . . 
  i ca n't say suck on deez nuts to your face but i ca n't get creative . . 
  with the firm promise of a terrestrial line that needs only $ 380 mil more to happen . . 
  well , probably serbia . 
  i had hopes for moldova to align to a straightforward process but like usual they have thrown everything to the shitters . . 
  yeah , expect it to be more like 3-3 .5 . . 
  nope , it 's still rather shitty . . , 
  i ca n't get used to good news about romania . . 
  even if by a miraculous twist of events moldova gets it 's shit together , enters the eu and the population wants this union it will be more advantageous from a strategically point of view to keep 2 states for more voting power . . 
  read that : we 're ready to make some deals . 
  syria is an obvious subject . 
  i 'm curious about others . . 
  how much was the bribe ? 
  it 's more of an avoiding state hospital infections statement and all the chain of hyenas waiting for tips and bribes even for the most elementary service . 
  to believe people shell out a few thousand euros just to have bragging rights is a little short sighted . 
  wow , of which moldova are we talking about though ? 
  wow , i bet it 's going to be a fun 7 months !, 
  no , it proves they 're shaolin masters of hiding shit !, 
  well a good part of them are professionals . 
  their trade is sadly not recognised . . 
  wait , so that means in 2018 czechia ( yup i did it ) and romania will both celebrate 100 years from the creation of their modern states . 
  fistbump bros !, 
  well it 's, 
  i 'm sure that an ultimatum is just the thing to soften their hearts . . 
  tl dr the richer you are the earlier you live the nest . . 
  trust me it were approved our politicians would be rubbing our noses in it . 
  we would certainly know . . 
  we had a roadmap to schengen , accomplished all the criteria , spent over a billion euro and got rejected on political reasons ... 
  well we got burned with schengen before so there 's that . . 
  and it 's solved . 
  visas will be lifted from dec 2017 . 
  so much for wisdom . . 
  problem solved !, 
  ( translated with google ) `` we reached an agreement with canada , a reasonable agreement . 
  we are in a position to withdraw the reserve declared against ceta . 
  romania has no objection to the trade agreement with canada , '' said president klaus johannis in brussels on friday . 
  agreement with canada on lifting visa is gradually : from may 1 , 2017 canada eliminate visas for romanians who had a visa , and from december 1 , 2017 canada abolished visas for the romanian citizens . 
  johannis also said that canadian authorities have kept a possibility of reversing the decision if it finds that the number of illegal immigrants is very high . 
  but this clause can only be activated early in the lifting of visa , after three years can not be used by canada . 
  basically , at the moment romania has no reason to use its right of veto regarding the eu-canada . 
  trade agreement is still jeopardized by opposition belgian region of wallonia . 
  it needs and consent that belgium can approve the agreement . 
  decisive talks are scheduled for today between european leaders and those of the belgian walloon region . 
  president klaus johannis said as bulgaria reached a similar deal . 
  dude , canada has visa waiver with mexico . 
  romanian criminality is a sad joke besides that in mexico . 
  the real reason is economic migration . 
  everybody hates poor people . . 
  da fuq you on about mate ? 
  the picture was taken this month by me personally . 
  some might have been taken down , but a small percentage . . 
  there is a price though . 
  here what a lighting post looks in bucharest : http://imgur.com/zbtytmq, 
  ok . obviously i was wrong , and i should have checked the data in the comment i 've read myself before making sarcastic remarks . 
  i would like to extend my sincere apologies to you gentlemen for any inconveniences . 
  please , carry on . . 
  bran castle just redefined the term tourist trap . . 
  you 're embarrassing the rest of us !, 
  i 'll give you your upvote and raise you this : http://imgur.com/q4ijrxb http://imgur.com/8ilqr3m, 
  hungary did this years ago . 
  sorry bros , nothing special here . 
  it will only get interesting when those that contracted loans in euros realise that the euro also was much weaker before the crisis and they could sue the state for discrimimation and demand equal treatement . 
  then it 's interesting . 
  then probably no bank in romania can swallow that . 
  so either the state marches on and then bailouts the banks ( with borrowed money ) or it backtracks on all of this shit . 
  until then i hope the frank loaners enjoy their bailout . . 
  i wondered how the hell they do n't clog their sinks all my childhood, 
  romania checking in as an `` under the sink '' nation . 
  there was a comment earlier that showed just that . 
  that between '95 and 2015 mongolia grew more than russia . 
  the difference with stans was just ridiculous . . look it up, 
  it could be worse though . . 
  yeah , i 'm sure mongolia bathes in western cash . . 
  the problem is that it 's really hard to find a balanced russian online that could explain things clearly and without bias , as even the ones that know a thing or two selfcensor . . 
  so it 's gloom and doom from the west and rose and petals from the east . 
  those of us that are genuinely interested just hope to understand something reading between the lines . . 
  then kick us out . 
  you probably need to kick out bulgaria too , right ? 
  who else ? 
  hungary , of course then maybe poland ? 
  all that for demanding equal rights ? 
  it 's precisely because we want the same things as a whole that we are in this situation . 
  i hope you remember we got burned once already with schengen with these exact kind of promises . . fool me once , you ca n't get fooled again . . 
  which leads us to this singular moment in time where ceta is fucked . 
  i understand the implications of a decision like this but i thought people involved in such negotiations were mature enough to understand that this could happen , especially when the trade negotiations were well under way and signals were given . 
  they could have pretended to threaten canada with reciprocity and canada should have pretended to be scared and solve it . 
  instead they just postponed it and canada did n't move a finger knowing all well they would n't do it . 
  then what 's the point of signing treaties ? 
  the eu should have reciprocated the visa requirement for the citizens of the us and canada long ago eu wide . 
  it says so in the treaties . 
  they did n't have the balls . 
  they just postponed and postponed . 
  this could have been solved years ago . 
  it has now come to this . 
  i want to congratulate our emissaries for the courage . 
  romania and bulgaria showing up late to the party , dressed in shit clothes with no money . 
  the rest of the guys chip in and buy them a few rounds .

  most likely , after he left , the employees stole all the quality stuff and kept it for themselves or sold it on the black market , leaving the peasants to wait in line for whatever crap remained . 
  the only county that had well stocked grocery stores was sibiu county , because the county head was ceausescu 's son , who wanted to be seen positively by the people , as he would have been the most likely successor to his father . 
  would i fight for my country ? 
  yes , definitely !, 
  would i join the romanian army , led by scumbags who were made generals for absolutely no reason other than receiving huge pensions and other benefits from the state ? 
  no , fuck that !, 
  i 'm not cannon fodder !, 
  i would only join the army if they ** publicly executed ** all commanders , from officers to generals , who got promoted for any reason other than legitimate merit . 
  our president has gone into full allahu akbar mode against them . 
  there will be a referendum on the issue . 
  however , his power is limited and the crooks have control of a large part of the media which is pushing russian style propaganda . 
  the problem is that a large part of the population , especially older people eat that propaganda up . 
  who from the eu will fix it exactly ? 
  merkel ? 
  or maybe that loud mouth with shitty teeth who manages to piss everyone off ... verhofstadt ? 
  the eu has n't been able to fix jack shit in the past couple of years , they were unable to stop the migrant crisis , unable to make russia calm the fuck down , unable to prevent brexit and unable to stop hungary and poland from becoming increasingly regressive and authoritarian . 
  i 'm surprised how many people assume trump will act rationally , he is a narcissist with a brain the size of a peanut and all he cares about is feeding his ego , even if that means being extremely toxic for the us and the entire world . 
  i do n't think there was ever a president in us history who managed to piss off half of the fucking world before he even took office . 
  if trump does n't quickly change his attitude , and i mean radically change his attitude , he will do irreversible damage that can not be simply reversed by the next president in 2021 . 
   i hope the eu will assist in doing so like they did in romania with great success . 
  umm , yeah , about that , if you have n't heard , the party which recently won the election has gone into full allahu akbar mode against the anticorruption directorate and they are trying to pass emergency ordinances to pardon all the crooked politicians and modify the criminal code to basically legalize corruption . 
  also , the head of senate just gave the eu the middle finger yesterday . 
  they are willing to do just about anything , including completely fucking up the country , just so that they can be able to keep on stealing . 
  well , in romania it 's perfectly legalto say whatever you want in most cases ( except on the radio or tv ) . 
  for example , this was said about our former pm , adrian nastase ( 2000-2004 ) by a political opponent , while he was still in power ( and a strong supporter of censorship )  adrian nastase - a dangerous sick man , protagonist of several video tapes , where he appears as an active participant ( passive , actually ) at homosexual orgies . 
  one of them was filmed at a gay club in england , where candyboy [ nastase 's nickname ] is playing with several other fags , all of them naked . 
  the tapes were , of course , never proven to exist , but still , no one was prosecuted . 
   calling someone a goat fucker and child rapist is not satire . 
  how do you know erdogan is not a goat fucker and/or child rapist ? 
  i do n't know about israel 's head of state , but the head of government is definitely a complete scumbag . 
  why has n't this happened already ? 
  why no lane markings after the bridge ? 
  did they resurface the road in the middle of winter ? 
   the flight was escorted by italian eurofighter and french mirage fighter jets while traversing their respective airspaces . 
  the swiss air force did not respond because the incident occurred outside normal office hours , which are 08:00 -- 12:00 and 13:30 -- 17:00 ; a swiss air force spokesman stated : `` switzerland can not intervene because its airbases are closed at night and on the weekend . 
  it 's a question of budget and staffing . '', 
  switzerland relies on neighboring countries to police its airspace outside of regular business hours . 
  the french air force has permission to escort suspicious flights into swiss airspace , but does not have authority to shoot down an aircraft over switzerland . 
  slovenia and poland ? 
  like the timon and pumbaa of europe ? 
   i 'll never put my panties in a bet weak . 
  yeah , but dragnea ( head of the sdp ) is trying to now use this guy as an excuse for his mass pardoning plan ( `` see , ppl are dying in prizon , we need to do something asap '' ) . 
  of course , dragnea is more concerned about his own legal problems , as he is already serving a sentence on parole and will likely soon be convicted for another crime , in which case he would be going straight to prison for the next 5-7 years or so . 
  50 lei ... could have been 80 , but unfortunately i do n't have a dog . 
  actually , a journalist just digged this and discovered mortality rates in romanian prisons are three times less than in the general population [ source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/romania/comments/5q1m2j/til_mortalitatea_\u00een_penitenciarele_din_rom\u00e2nia/ ), 
  miss belgium , i 'd tap that if she would be alive and ~ 85 years younger today . 
  the rest , i do n't know man , i 'm not a huge fan of today 's beauty standards either , but back then it 's like they had a completely different idea of beauty . 
   you do n't need it to serbia but need it to moldova ? 
  moldova is more backwards . 
   but actually moldova should be an appealing destination for romanians , no ? 
  at least for personal/family reasons . . moldova is one the least visited countries on earth . 
  i 'm sure there are some mixed romanian/moldovan married couples , but it 's not such a big number . 
  when i was in moldova , 3 years ago , there were relatively few cars with romanian license plates ( there were very few cars in general , some parts of the country can feel almost like north korea ) , i 've seen more cars with romanian license plates in vienna than i 've seen in chisinau ( and there are n't so many care with romanian license plates in vienna ) . 
  i remember there was some news last year of some hijacked plane from africa that flew over switzerland but was n't intercepted because it was during the off hours . 
  it was rather embarrassing , to say the least . 
  you also know nato is fucked up when the reason greece spends so much on defense is fear of another nato member . 
   ukraine is not so far from romania for instance , and it 's cheaper than going west ... definitely not the case , i can book a flight from my city to germany for literally 3 euros , [ i shit you not ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5pw3xr6.png ) . 
  also , most people do n't care to go to ukraine or moldova , because : - there 's not much to visit there , at least compared to the west ; - the only things which are significantly cheaper in ukraine/moldova are cigarettes and alcohol and it is extremely illegal to bring back more than a very small amount ( like 2 packs of cigarettes per person ) ; - waiting times at the hungarian/bulgarian border are like 5-10 minutes , at the ukrainian/moldovan border they can be up to 5 hours , especially when you are crossing from ukraine/moldova back into romania ; - exchanging romanian lei for ukrainian hryvnias or moldovan lei is more expensive than exchanging them for euros - ukrainian/moldovan roads suck ass , so if you go by car , you will likely have to go straight to a repair shop when coming back . 
  - serbia , which is the only other non-eu neighbor of romania only requires an id card for romanian citizens , no need for a passport . 
  the romanian one is around $ 50 for 5 years . 
  i think it 's reasonable though , most people do n't need a passport anyway . 
  italy 's coat of arms looks too fucking communist . 
  did n't know tesla had 3 new models , the old ones looked better . 
  in soviet russia , braille reads you . 
  who is the disgrace ? 
  sarkozy or the gypsies ? 
  the funny thing is that a `` republic '' is implicitly assumed to be democratic and thus ruled by the people . 
  calling a dictatorship `` democratic people 's republic '' is basically as retarded as calling a club `` the golfers ' golfing golf club '' despite the people at that club having nothing to do with golf . 
  sarkozy tried that once , he gave them plane tickets and $ 300 per person , it was like a vacation for them , in one month they were all back in france . 
  a bit misleading , the first thing that came into my mind was `` wtf , since when is there a half cent coint '', 
  so what if the media was pinning the protests on him , i do n't a president who plays by a3 's and rtv 's rules . 
  the people who believe what the a3/rtv says already have a hole in their brain so it 's pointless for iohannis to try to appeal to those sorts of people , in fact the only way he could stop the a3/rtv talking shit about him was if he just sat in his office all day and let the crooks do whatever they want . 
  yup , works like a charm , especially on older people ( who were already brainwashed during communism and thus very susceptible to the type of propaganda the sdp is pushing ) and people with little education , especially in rural areas who are easily manipulated . 
  most people have at least a few grandparents/parents/uncles / aunts/in-laws or whatever who votes for sdp . 
  which part sounds like sarcasm ? 
  personally , i 'm not sure iohannis is completely clean ( i 'm not sure any romanian politician is completely clean tbh ) , but at least he 's much , much , much cleaner than the puppet government who are basically trying to pass an emergency ordinance that would free all crooked politicians and their friends from the private sector and turn romania into a mafia state . 
  well , germany is seen here as a sort of utopia of how romania should be like . 
  people want german roads , german houses , german cars , german working conditions , german salaries , pretty much german everything except german internet ( sorry , but your internet sucks compared to ours ) . 
  especially on the houses part , i see everyone who worked in germany for a few years , when they come back they renovate their houses to look as german as their wallet allows ( i have n't seen this with people who have worked in other country like spain , italy , uk etc ) . 
  since germans have always been seen as serious , hardworking and honest people , of course iohannis ' ethnicity was sort of an advantage during the election campaign , but of course the opposing sdp tried their best to turn it into a bad thing ( merkel puppet , foreigners taking over romania and other bullcrap ) , even though the sdp supported iohannis becoming pm way back in 2010 when they were sort of on the same side and also the piece of shit tariceanu , who is now one of iohannis ' most vocal critics once said he ( iohannis ) was a good candidate to romania 's presidency . 
  well it 's a protest against what the government is trying to do , so i think it 's appropriate to call it an anti-government protest . 
  also , i doubt anyone at the protest would mind if all the cabinet members would be put on a rocket ship and sent to the moon . 
  condoms suck though . 
   an existing democracy with opposing parties is my higher priority for now . 
  i understand , but my point is that fights like these do not help build a stable democracy in any way . 
  the thing is when the ruling party has control of the propaganda machine , incidents like these will always be spun off to make it look like the opposition is full of uncivillized thugs , no matter who starts it . 
  this is also true of protests . 
   actually occasional fights in the parliament can be a sign of working democracy . 
  no , they are absolutely not . 
  fights are never an answer for solving disagreements , maybe only if you 're in the sixth grade . 
  mps should be an example of behavior for the population , they should always speak and act in a civilized manner , even when they intensely disagree . 
  fights are a manifestation of weak people exhausting their rational arguments . 
  after all , the parliament expresses its power through voting , if you beat up an mp who disagrees with you , do you think it will make them reconsider their vote ? 
  quite the opposite i would say . 
  not really government paranoia , but mostly soviet mentality of army commanders , `` blin this my territory you no take picture unless i say so '' . 
  however , if you give them a small present , like a bottle of jack daniels or 20-50 $ , the `` paranoia '' quickly goes away and they let you take pictures of everything you want , they 'll probably even take you on a tour . 
  if you drive there with an expensive car , you might have to take a train/plane ride back home , otherwise you should be fine . 
  yeah , i think otto warmbier would want to say something about that . 
   govt paranoia about photography of anything military apparently that 's ridiculous , their entire millitary budget is around 16 million euros ( or dollars , ca n't remember , like it matters anyway ) , which is like 1/5th of the budget of schwechat . 
  transnistria alone ( without the russian troops ) has a larger army , better equipment , and better trained soldiers than moldova proper .

  instead of increasing the deficit it could , i do n't know , convince its ministers to steal less , so that there is more money left for the military . 
  yes , several romanian ministers siphoned huge amounts of money , for their own use or that of their parties . 
  some of them are in jail for that . 
  armenia ? 
  really ? 
  does turkey fear armenia now ? 
  yes , i know that the russians are there in armenia and i agree that turkey 's budget is that not big percentage-wise , i just take issue with putting armenia on that list . 
  good !, 
  a welcome sign that nato allies are equal , in the sense that they deserve a similar level of protection . 
  this is how some bits of romania looked like back in the 60s . 
  indeed . 
  they have been lucky enough to be situated further away from russia and thus did n't get to experience russia 's `` love '' so they have this positive view of the russians . 
  there 's also quite a lot of anti-americanism in greece . 
  is it not because of turkey , another nato ally , with whom you seem to have a pretty schizophrenic relationship ? 
  i 'm in favour of nato members spending their share ( 2 % or more ) on defence but given the situation greece finds itself in nowadays , that really does n't make much sense . 
  thanks , interesting point . 
  it was an important battle no doubt and also a clear french victory . 
  no , it does n't :-) though i somehow expect more `` royalty '' from the french president than the dutch king . 
  no insult intended , i just get the feeling that the dutch royalty is closer to the people ( less detached , more interaction with them ; you also have koningsdag which seems to be quite a popular holiday ) than the french presidents . 
  i agree with most of your points . 
  when talking about celebration i was mostly thinking about the austerlitz coin , not the waterloo one . 
  what got me irked about the belgian waterloo coin was the fact that the belgians chose to clearly ignore the french opposition and mint the coin anyway , and that is quite petty and un-european . 
  it is of course a small issue , but if we europeans are not able to solve the small issues through mutual respect , than how are we going to solve the big issues ? 
  i fully agree with you . 
  well , that could be argued about many battles . 
  i agree that applies a bit more to waterloo . 
  i see less of that for the french austerlitz coin . 
  not everything takes place on reddit you know . 
  because i did n't do it on reddit but on facebook . 
  but thanks for checking . 
  i posted the comment above because i was mildly outraged and felt like a fool for backing the french position ( with which i still agree but proved to be hypocritical in their case ) . 
  there are wars and victories with different significance . 
  i do n't have anything against celebrating the end of wwii and the liberation of europe ( at least of the part that was liberated ) as the evil of the nazi regime was in a category of its own . 
  its defeat is something to celebrate . 
  and i have nothing against celebrating other victories , revolutions , proclamations etc. . 
  i studied history in university so i am interested about these things . 
  but celebrating xix century national victories over some other european nations ( like austerlitz ) on the common currency of everybody ( well , the euro countries ) feels a bit out of place . 
  should the germans put on a coin that time in 1870-71 when they beat the french ? 
  should the germans put on a coin those times when they divided poland or should us romanians put on a coin that time when we occupied budapest ? 
  rather not . 
  i do n't know , i just find it a bit weir to have celebrations of victory against other nations on the common currency/coins , including of those defeated nations . 
  because this is about celebration , i do n't see france or other nations making coins about some military defeat they incurred . 
  all our nations have won some wars or battles at some point , i understand that is part of national identity and i understand the need to celebrate that nationally but it 's a bit weird to do it at the european level , including on the coins of the party that was defeated . 
  regarding expectations regarding france , i 'm far from thinking that it is the least nationalistic country but i was surprised by this austerlitz coin because of the position of france ( with which i agree/d ) regarding the belgian waterloo coin . 
  but enough about coins . 
  indeed . 
  that european nations are still happy to celebrate their victories over other european nations , including on their common currency . 
  thank you for the explanations . 
  i knew about horv\u00e1th as a surname and the fact that it means croat but i was puzzled by poke133 's comment that hungary 's most common surname actually means `` croat/croatian person '' . 
  horv\u00e1th is also used among the hungarians in romania . 
  thanks . 
  that certainly does n't look presidential . 
  not so much the fact that he was on a cart pulled by dogs but his inadequate position ( ' i am just here , carried by others ' ) . 
  tell me that is not the president of france . 
  nagy means croat ? 
  is this for real ? 
  i just defended france several times and criticized the belgians for their choice to do a 2\u00a01/2 euro coin for the battle of waterloo and now i see this ? 
  france , i am gone , you are alone on this one ... 
  yeah , unfortunately , this one will not go down easily . 
  he is one of the most arrogant and thickest skinned politicians we ever had . 
  but even for him pressure from the other european countries matters so i hope the other european leaders will not act as if nothing is happening . 
  and till then he will also greatly hurt the country and its international standing and credibility . 
  but that 's what happens when you have a shitty political class and elect jerks as prime ministers . 
  they are still by far the two countries with the biggest number of romanians , even after the crisis . 
  ah , yes , you can see it 's a russian writing . 
  russia does n't deal with ukrainians , or romanians , or moldovans etc. . no , no , no , these are insignificant little people , it always has to be the us involved . 
  we , the people of europe , do not have opinions , positions , wishes or goals , and we do n't take independent actions , it 's always the us controlling us . 
  all of us . 
  you got it , russia . 
  yes , i agree , just saying that they might be just a bit better ( less brutal ) than in 2009 . 
  you are wrong . 
  if turkey puts economic sanctions on an eu member states there will be consequences for the eu-turkey relations . 
  turkey is negotiating eu accession ; you can not want to join a club and sanction its members because you do n't like their views regarding your history . 
  that the eu will react if turkey imposes sanctions on one eu member state . 
  can confirm for romania , the reason is the tv series . 
  it will not and i hope the turks are aware of that . 
  good arguments . 
  then , after invading czechoslovakia in 1968 , it would have been a bit of a stretch for the soviets to quickly do the same in romania . 
  there were no soviet troops in romania since 1958 and ceausescu had positioned part of the army to prepare for an invasion so an invasion of romania would have been bloody and pretty bad for both parties involved . 
  moreover , romania was surrounded by communist countries ( warsaw pact and yugoslavia ) so it was pretty safe communist territory . 
  some do get a bit offended , or they will be quick to point out that romania is not situated in the balkans . 
  in romania , the dacia sandero base model goes for 7,190 euros ( = # 5,122 ) . 
  yes , compulsory to have them . 
  that was exactly my reaction :-), 
  we do . 
  i do n't think he necessarily wanted to do that or that there was any logic to what he was doing . 
  the guy was drunk when that happened . 
  also , there is no eu president ; it there would be one that would most likely be the president of the european council . 
  the guy was caught near the european parliament , which is about 1 km away from the european council . 
   benefits here so he is talking about romanians working in germany and you go talking about `` claiming benefits '' ? 
  what is the logic in that ? 
  and how are these people both working ( `` compression of wages '' ) and claiming benefits at the same time ? 
  why are german companies hiring thousands of romanians to pick asparagus or built buildings ? 
  why is not the `` indigenous population '' doing that ? 
  before romanians you imported labour from italy , turkey , marocco and a lot of other places so the issue is not romania being in the eu but more like germany needing foreign labour . 
  ok , then my bad . 
  central and eastern european . 
  there . 
  no , romanian in most reports , just registered in bulgaria . 
  `` brussels police on monday detained a slovakian man dressed in camouflage gear near the european parliament and found a gun and a chainsaw in his car , triggering a security scare which caused several offices to be evacuated .

   do you have any reliable sources that show the romanians living in wallachia called themselves that the oldest surviving dated document written in romanian ( neac\u0219u 's letter , 1521 ) uses this . 
   do you have any reliable sources that show the romanians living in wallachia called themselves that or that people outside the principality itself referred to it as such before the 1800 's ? 
  plenty of them . 
   genetically speaking , romanians are not latin . 
  genetically speaking , neither the french , nor the spaniards are latin . 
   romania was the name of the byzantine empire the name of romania has nothing to do with the name the byzantines used for themselves . 
  it 's simply that both the romanians and the greeks ( romaioi ) called themselves `` roman citizens '' . 
  the native name of wallachia was \u021aeara rum\u00e2neasc\u0103 ( `` rumanian land '' < vulgar latin `` terra romanesca '' ) . 
  `` rom\u00e2nia '' was a neologism coined from `` rom\u00e2n '' ( romanian ) in order to be used for the whole romanian nation ( as opposed to just wallachia ) . 
   were adamant about legitimizing the idea that they were directly descended from the romans well , the language is descended from latin and that 's what matter . 
  any claim of genetic purity is nationalist nonsense and that 's valid for any nation . 
  we 're all a mix of people from across the continent . 
  i 'm not surprising  the romanian language is n't slavic even though it used to be written in cyrillic because there are clear latin influences `` there are clear latin influences '' is an understatement . 
  the core vocabulary is 80-90 % inherited from latin . 
  a lot of the `` lesser '' vocabulary is indeed slavic , but that does n't change the basic fabric of the language . 
  for culture , it 's a different thing , slavic cultural heritage is much more visible than ancient latin cultural heritage , but i do n't think there 's a dispute over the language . 
  romania comes from our ethnic name , `` rum\u00e2n '' or `` rom\u00e2n '' , which in turn comes from `` romanus '' ( roman citizen ) . 
  the whole balkan peninsula was conquered and colonized by the romans , but we were the only people to keep their latin language in this region . 
  further south , the greek influence was strong enough to prevent latin language from spreading and in hungary , the latin people were probably assimilated by the slavs and then by the hungarians . 
  the former ( rum\u00e2n , rum\u00e2nesc , rum\u00e2nia ) was generally far more often used before our 19th century elite promoted the use of the latter ( rom\u00e2n , rom\u00e2nesc , rom\u00e2nia ) to emphasise our latin origin . 
  many languages still use the `` u '' version . 
  before the modern era , our local neighbours ( hungarians , slavs , etc ) called us `` vlachs '' ( ol\u00e1h in hungarian , \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0445 in slavic ) , but we never used that term to refer ourselves . 
   horses may be given hormones and other chemicals that cows for human consumption would not have been given , actually , race horses may get some antibiotics which are n't good for human consumption , due to being potentially cancerogenous . 
  it 's the cows who get the growth hormones . 
  apart from the antibiotics ( which most horses wo n't get , anyway ; the race horse get them only in case of injury ) , arguably , horse meat is healthier than other kinds of meat : the horses are quite picky about food , so they wo n't accept all the crap that we feed cows , like protein meals made from bones and meat , which led to the mad cow disease in the first place . 
  your prisons will turn makeshift criminals ( because using drugs is a crime ) into real criminals . 
  ( because they can no longer ever get a job ), 
  around that area , there are hungarian villages and romanian villages , you can draw the border to include just the hungarian villages . 
  [ this is a map of the communes ] ( http://sebok1.adatbank.transindex.ro/kepek/retnikai.jpg ) -- an even better map would be a map of the villages . 
  it was sarcasm . 
  indeed , but that was related to the technology at that time . 
  with current more advanced and productive technology , it should be even easier to have an `` easy life '' for everyone . 
   there has n't been much neoliberalism in slovenia neoliberalism contains : * eliminating price controls \u2714 ( eu requirement ) * deregulating capital markets \u2714 ( eu requirement ) * lowering trade barriers \u2714 ( eu requirement ) * no nationalizations without compensation \u2714 ( eu requirement ) * reduction of subsidies across all economic areas \u2714 ( eu requirement ) * the government borrowing money from the free market \u2714 * privatization of state companies \u2714 * floating exchange rates \u2714 * fiscal austerity \u2714 * privatization of utilities ( water , railroads , etc ) -- underway * privatization of healthcare ( us-style insurance system ) -- to do * privatization of education ( vouchers system ) -- to do, 
  indeed . 
  privatization is a socialist concept . 
  it was n't about `` competition '' as it was about fear . 
  communism was a great scarecrow for both the capitalists and the western governments . 
  they wanted the workers to be happy , because they thought ( rightly so ) that otherwise , they could become radical . 
  now there 's virtually no left-wing radicalism ( the `` radical '' policies of today are the `` social-democratic '' policies of a few decades ago ) , so there 's no need to appease the workers . 
  the balance of power between the workers and the elite keeps changing . 
  in the western world , life used to be easier than now for the average person during the 1960s and it was far worse during the 1860s . 
   it 's this bullshit neoliberal religion that 's pushing 3/4 of the world into poverty do n't worry , it 's not going to push just 3/4 of the world into poverty , it 's going to push all the world into poverty , all for the benefit of the 1 % elite in each country . 
  subsidies in europe/us/japan : * for the farmers : guaranteed money , less risk , they can compete ( and win ) with the third world farmers . 
  * for the european/american/japanese people : cheaper food * for the companies in eu/us/jp : slightly higher taxes , but more stability ( supply of food is an important factor in stability ) overall , in here , it 's better for everyone . 
  -- however , the third world is flooded with cheap subsidized food . 
  their farmers can no longer compete . 
  it used to be a way of lifting oneself out of poverty : sell food , buy equipment , industrialize the country . 
  of course , asking the developed world to do something against their own interests is pointless . 
  all the wealthy countries ( us , eu , japan ) spend huge amounts of money to keep agriculture going , although it would be far cheaper to `` outsource '' it to the third-world ( africa , south america ) . 
  the main reason is control : if any of them were importing much of their food , the countries exporting the food would have a certain degree of power over them . 
  people can live with more expensive oil , but more expensive food could lead to protests and fall of governments , maybe even a revolution . 
  of course , the way the subsidies are distributed in the eu ( favoring large-scale industrial farms and certain countries ) reflects the lobby in brussels and that 's a different topic . 
   let 's talk about belgium . 
  that 's [ rude . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/guide/belgium.shtml ), 
   sofia looks comically identical with bucharest . 
  indeed , ugly apartment buildings ( in which just some apartments got their exterior renovated ) , derelict buildings , stray dogs , ugly fences , general disrepair of the public spaces and , if i go to the suburbs , gypsy slums with streets without asphalt and sewerage . 
  it feels like home !, 
   the reason why kosovo is so important to us is because of heritage you should get over it , you 're not going to ever get it back . 
  serbs are not the only nation to lose their most `` precious '' historical land : * the armenians lost their holy mountain , ararat , to turkey * the greeks lost their great city , constantinople , to turkey * the romanians lost part of bukovina , the core from which the moldavian principality grew , to ukraine . 
  neither can be reverted , because in this age , only the ethnicity that inhabits those lands matters . 
  a bit of history of what happened to the jews in romania : * northern transylvania : occupied by hungary , the local jews were sent to auschwitz by the hungarian authorities * transnistria ( ukrainian territories occupied by romania ) : jews killed by einsatzgruppen in collaboration with the romanian army ; biggest massacre in odessa . 
  * bessarabia : some jews killed by einsatzgruppen in collaboration with the romanian army ; the rest were deported to transnistria by the romanian army . 
  * right-bank moldavia : a part of the jews were deported to transnistria by the romanian army , which was also involved a pogrom in ia\u0219i ; nevertheless , many survived . 
  * wallachia ( including bucharest ) and southern transylvania : a few jews were deported to transnistria and some were killed during an anti-antonescu rebellion of the iron guard ; most survived . 
  holocaust deniers here in romania look at the fate of the jews in southern romania and they say `` look this way , antonescu saved the jews of bucharest '' , disregarding the massacres in moldavia , bessarabia and transnistria , which they claim were made only by the einsatzgruppen , not the romanian army . 
  the map simply shows that isps still do n't take ipv6 seriously . 
  in romania , there 's just a big isp ( rds ) that started deploying ipv6 , hence the higher percentage . 
  of course , it was n't an ideological failure , but a military one . 
  in western countries , communism failed mostly because the army was strong enough to quell any revolution . 
  other western revolutions , in bavaria ( 1918-1919 ) and spain ( 1930s ) , were similarly destroyed by stronger armies . 
   i wonder how it would have turned out if the first communist revolution happened in a country where anyone could understand why the cheka actually , the first communist revolution ( la commune de paris ) did happen in a developed country ( france was arguably the most developed country at that time , if not industrially , at least socially , culturally and in living standards ) , just that they were crushed within a few months . 
  it 's a funny thing about what southern americans and eastern europeans think . 
  the eastern europeans think about the russians almost exactly what the southern americans think about the us . 
   a lot of peasants benefited from communism , including my own grandparents . 
  in two generations , my family went from `` poorest in the village '' to `` urban intelectuals '' . 
  same in my case . 
  my great-grandfather was in the 1930s a fisherman on the danube , living with his large family in a 2-room mud hut and eating all-year-round fish and m\u0103m\u0103lig\u0103 , with the occasional vegetables during the summer . 
  my grandfather was sent to be an apprentice in bucharest , to become a tailor ; my father is an engineer . 
  within the pre-wwii framework , my father would have had almost no chance of getting an engineering diploma , as my grandfather was just a badly-paid tailor . 
   you can have good social mobility in a capitalist state with the correct framework and government support . 
  pre-wwii romania had no such `` correct framework '' and with left-wingers being repressed , there was no one to support it , either . 
  fewer than 1 % of young people got to study at university , an overwhelming majority being children of the economic/political elite . 
  fewer than 5 % of the children graduated from secondary education and almost half of the population was illiterate . 
  well , in socialist countries , it depended on each country . 
  in romania , [ the orthodox church collaborated quite well with the communist authorities ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orthodox_church_in_communist_romania ) . 
   but some would argue that it does contain class discrimination embedded into it . 
  how can there be class discrimination , if by marx 's definition , social classes are part of the capitalist mode of production ? 
  in early socialist romania , there was some `` affirmative action '' ( in education , for instance ) for people from peasant/worker families , but that did n't prevent plenty of people of bourgeois origin ( in romania , for instance , petru groza and mihail sadoveanu ) to become part of the ruling elite . 
   the problem with historical communism is that it existed in authoritarian states and was run by authoritarians actually , there is one exception for that rule : [ anarchist catalunya ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutionary_catalonia ) , before stalin 's minions repressed the anarchists and other communists . 
  basically : * communism argues for a better world for everyone , regardless of race , ethnicity , religion . 
  * nazism argues for a better world for the chosen race and no rights for the `` untermenschen '' ( jews , africans , gypsies , etc. ) . 
  of course , the way it was implemented has nothing to do with the theory . 
  yeah , they 're about right . 
  on the groceries , there are listed probably the cheapest you can find . 
  indeed . 
  they ** blackmailed ** us into giving them rights , such as education in their own language . 
  such horrible , horrible people , those hungarians !, 
   the cost of renting and paying for utilities and food in romania and luxembourg is not comparable . 
  surprisingly or not , the cost of the cheapest food is not very different across the eu .

  i think what he said is dumb , you think that what i said it 's dumb let 's call it a day . 
  as i said , i find it inappropriate . 
  whether you or anybody else think i 'm right or wrong it 's a matter of debate , but my opinion is my opinion and i think i 'm entitled to have it . 
  thank you !, 
  oh , but it 's quite safe . 
  i only had a broken knee until now  i just took my license last month , but i have `` a little '' experience off-road so riding on normal roads is like a charm . 
  yeah , well i ca n't . 
  at least not yet , hopefully never !, 
  i do n't try to judge anyone here , i just say i could n't do such thing . 
  it 's your opinion and your entitled to have it . 
  whether i find it appropriate or not it 's my opinion . 
  fair ? 
  so we better stay here and try to enjoy what life has to offer , hopefully more good than bad  i have to call her otherwise she 'll be very worried , especially since i 'm her only daughter and `` crazy enough to ride a dangerous motorcycle '' . 
  i did n't move yet , since i 'm too young but i try to have my share of little travels in the summer months . 
  she 's not pleased about that , of course , 
  i would n't do that for anything in the world !, 
  he could have been a little more emotional and could n't handle the breaking up . 
  i 've heard about things like that from both boys and girls and i never could understand them . 
  life is made to be lived cos it 's so damn short and from what i 'm aware , we only have one . 
  we should be thankful that we , more or less , live in a peaceful society and we see war , destruction , famine and things like that only on t.v. !, 
  breaking up from a boy ... good riddance , next in line please . 
  edit : thanks !, 
  i 'm not home and because of this thread i did a good thing for my soul , i called me mum , 
  i do n't know , maybe , but i still think it 's totally inappropriate . 
  my opinion . 
  i really ca n't understand people who find pleasure by mocking someone 's death , especially a child 's death !, 
  it 's unthinkable for me why anyone would commit suicide at 18 ( or any other age ) !, 
  incidentally i 'm 18 and i do n't even want to think about death , not to mention suicide : / on topic , a dead parent it 's the worst thing i can think right now since my mom has a heart condition and i do n't quite paid much attention to her when she tells me about it . 
  looks like , just as any human being , i 'm quite biased and turned this into something that affects me personally , sorry for that . 
  yes indeed , it 's very complicated just like anything in that part of the world ( balkans and central europe of 1919 looks like a fairytale in comparison ) not to mention the total lack of political experience and/or conscience for majority of people there plus the religious `` fervor '' but who are we to deny a state of their own for an entire population of few millions ? 
  yes , politically would be another mess , morally ... 
  i do n't know . 
  heart failure at 14 and no problems before . 
  makes you think about your own way of life and what we 'll leave behind us if ... jesus !, 
  yes , isis is seen as `` the bad guys '' by anyone here . . 
  i think . 
  about pkk , to be honest , i did n't heard anything . 
  my opinion is that we will be supportive toward turkey , not that they 'll care about our support too much anyway , as long as they wo n't go full genocidal against kurds ( which could happen with an idiot like their putin 2.0 in power - hardly , but possible ) . 
  still , i think kurds deserve a state of their own . . in northern iraq or syria somewhere , since they fought enough for it . 
  my opinion , of course . 
  oh my goodness !, 
  that 's horrible , i do n't even want to imagine how much pain the poor man feels now . 
  condolences !, 
  though i believe a pkk established state it 's better than isis ... any kind of state ( organization . . whatever ) it 's better than those fk.rs . 
  but that 's just my biased opinion . 
  i did but i do n't quite follow , sorry  can you develop , why some sort of kurdish state would be bad for today 's romanian politics ? 
  so you say that we gon na have some internal political struggle if a kurdish state will emerge from this mess ? 
  thanks , 
  how so ? 
  kurdish with a gagauz flair ? 
  moldova should use this line as its new anthem . 
  yup , looks like i do n't live in it ... gim me a break hahahahahaha ;d, 
  vienna or prague . 
  keep it in the middle . 
  with putin as mc . 
  what language is officially adopted by all the balkans ? 
  does romance lingos have any place in the balkans ? 
  what the fuck is balkans ? 
  i think anyone between russia and germany is eastern europe and i kinda despise central europenists !, 
  my two euro cents ; ^ ), 
  even hungary is a part of it , in my opinion of course !, 
  give me one reason why we 're not part of it , as magyar speaking people ? 
  edit : we complain about the late borders , we love to argue , quality fight ( i mean you ca n't just say that is it ... ) , lot 's of things showing up from the boots and all those fences made of wood ... 
  of course it 's not , we both are ( fortunately ) slow people :d but thanks god nobody killed anyone from the other side in the last 20 years . 
  unfortunately we kinda like eachother only when roma people are involved , using fire is definitely barbaric by the way / ^ s, 
  i 've talked about balkans . 
  i think you did not understand my gist . 
  anyhow , it 's not a happy day . 
  maybe counties . 
  having a very different view about the world does n't mean we 're born in a different country , it just mean we have a different view about one thing . 
  2014 and thinking about how much of a `` sc\u00e2rbe de bozgori \u00eemputiti '' `` vorbiti dracului romaneste '' `` analilor sunteti tarani mizerabili fututi in cur , analilor ... da-i dracu ca unu nu stie romaneste ( \u2122 from one of my teacher ) '' , `` you obviously are worse than hungarians '' \u2122 from my romanian language teacher :d yeah right . 
  that 's in the european union . 
  edit : thanks god for our magyar and mathematics teacher , a very nice ... romanian guy !, 
  must be a different world , cos we definitely do n't see such things on cnn , 
  we definitely are . . 
  in the mainstream of russian people minds . 
  what could possibly motivate this shameful display ? 
  it 's just us . 
  okay , definitely i 'm not the one to explain why/what things ... 
  i 'm hungarian , i live in romania , i can even dance on `` we are romanians lets kill some invaders '' songs ( never heard killing anything-but you get my gist ) . 
  us , not u.s. , but us and we love it !, 
  we 're like a little russia , without a common dictator . 
  where 's the slavic brotherhood and hospitality ?!? 
  we probably must learn how to use a shotgun , parasites must be exterminated !, 
  ( i really hope my mom wo n't get a `` little visit '' from some anti-terrorist service cuz i wrote this from her phone :d ) imagine how much those stolen money could have meant for our countries and how we could 've been today without all the ... rape we 've endured unconsciously !, 
  all of us eastern europeans . 
  that 's far from funny , it 's outrageous !, 
  so , i have 14.400 $ per year and i managed to save ten times plus after spendings ?!, 
  at least our own politicians shut the fuck up about those things ... siberia for him !!, 
  that 's what lack of `` dna '' makes from normal people , 
  thrifty alright but still ... she ca n't tenfold increase his earnings only cuz she did n't spend anything . 
  people buy his lie ? 
  my oh my ... that 's slovakian flair not russian : ^ d slovakia 's currency is euro not rubbles . 
  that 's obviously yugoslavia , you ignorant you . 
  i 've seen kilograms ( rom : kilograme ) written as chilograme in a very old romanian almanac . 
  c'mon now , those are just random stripes . 
  otherwise they 'll have a little fence under the red ... , 
  what a pleb !, 
  he took a loan , in 15 years he 'll pay it ... gee :d, 
  yeah right ...

  i can not unsee croatia germany or norway . 
  very accurate the pigg ass taking a shit . 
  you just blew my mind . 
  is esteros turkey upside down then ? 
  i predict that at least 1/3 will be from the uk . 
  is that `` hot '' spot in transylvania a sign that god loves magyars or does it have a more scientific explication ? 
   should n't invest themselves into something , because external groups tell em to do so , be it society/state or their parents and friends . 
  yeah , but by that logic you let your kid stay at home and play video games . 
  let me make it clear a individual has earned the right to self determine himself once he is autonomous , before that his ideas , beliefs and values are worth jack shit . 
  his parents are responsible exclusively to get him to that point of autonomy , not him , he is to stupid and shielded to realise just how hard life is and how unimportant his `` beliefs '' and `` values '' actually are . 
   even costing the state more than if we were to just hand em a thousand euros a month without conditions attached . 
  college education takes a lot of room and people 's time , translating into money . 
  oh but that is the thing , the state and society does n't give a fuck on economy , because it knows the value of a somewhat capable collage graduate . 
  but i agree , college in it 's modern iteration is pretty useless , you should be enrolled in the army for 2 years of payed service and then go to a trade school of your choice being payed by the money you made in the army . 
   when third parties try to tell the individual what they assume that others might appreciate , in the end , at best it 's well intended guesswor what makes you think that the individual that never worked a day in his life and who values kim kardashian more than his mother know any better what others might appreciate or value ? 
  believing in yourself is bullshit ( like all belief systems it 's detached from relatity and delusional ) , hard work is the only thing that gets you to retirement . 
  we shall see , i expected more from mantle in terms of horse power and more from nvidia in term of stability , the both fucked up . 
  no problem , if anyone followed the thread up until now they deserve a break . 
  like brothers do, 
  i actually am supportive of studying anything up to polinesians gender roles , idgf , just do it as a hobby , do n't expect the state to pay for it , and do n't have the arrogance of expecting society to pay or value you for your insight . 
  oh definetly , i just think the input of a 18 year old , a 42 year old father and 72 year old cat lady are not the same and should not be valued in the same way . 
  the only people that should get to decide on the future of society are people that have children . 
  because that is the only phase of human existence where you are naturally selfless and not ego driven . 
  the rest are only rationalisations and self righteous ego strokes . 
  o do n't think robots will ever decide , there will be a party or even a pro robot religion but the men behind the robot will sthill make the decisions . 
  it 's human nature . 
  i know the point it there you have a real jump in performance but still less hype than in the case of cpus, 
  from a marketing point of view it just seems like gimmicks and stalling tactics . 
  when you compare gpu progress with cpu progress it is a joke . 
  when i hear the term next gen i can not not roll my eyes . 
  maybe a different architecture is interesting from a tech standpoint but from my perspective it is just a chance to reignite pointless hype . 
   and it 's for that we should establish a more direct democracy , if you ask me !, 
  i do not trust people : be it in a position of individual power or colective power . 
  people do not make good decisions and they have huge issues with anticipating problems . 
  but that is where i the guy responsible with marketing at vegan incorporated step in and i offer a more ethical alternative , sligtly expensive of course but when it comes to ethics you are not the type of man that puts money above values . 
  wait for it ... amazon is just a cost eater , once it scales down to monopolistic expenses the other shoe will drop . 
  no , conditioning basic income profesionally will only create more cronyism . 
  that is a one way street to a govermentally subsidiesed work force . 
  i would argue that until you grow up as a productive ( economically , spilling free rime poetry is not productivity ) member of society you should not vote , you should not get healthcare and you should not get your basic needs met . 
  from my point of view a family of imigrants that put in the economy 60 hours of work per week deserves more rights than the same number of social studies majors . 
  why use a competing currency when all the cool kids use cola dollars ? 
  yes , if there are a lot of supliers or supliers are flexible enough to intervene with fair and healthy offers . 
  in practice the free market is not universal , stable or inevitable . 
  it is an ideal state the state should strive for , but we currently expect it to just work and when it fails we renounce the idea and go completely in the other way to full on protectionism ( think of the children and the workers !! ), 
  you assume that people will want to provide labor , they want to make money , if they ca n't they 'll just stay at home and consume . 
   oh ok , it 's the marketers . 
  but why is it the marketers , if they do a good job getting more money to the company that it can then re-invest . 
  i would rather blame the incentive structure in place that leads to ceos to prioritize shareholder dividends , over making an even better product with the money they collect . 
  the business exists to make money , not to advance society . 
  the only reason they invest is because , if there is n't progress people wont buy a new phone , if people do n't buy a new phone their business not only does n't grow they will loose a great deal of estimated income . 
  i do n't know , i think intel is stalling and sweating while distracting the public with low heat low consumption options , while amd just adds more cores hoping the public wo n't see the r&d shortcuts they implement compared to the competition . 
  i think money will stop existing but i think we will sell our souls way before we run out of money . 
  think : each person has licencing deals with 4 to 5 brands . 
  these brands pay for your house , food and entertainment but you need to promote them with everything you do . 
  you will buy food with cola dollars and you will pay electricity with a eon fellowship lifetime-medium consumer pass you registered at your government . 
  ( the government is actually paying for you , while eon is just ranking in the cash and manging issues for the goverment if you encounter any ), 
   i think marketers are adding value . 
  of course , just do n't mistake it with utility or performance . 
  we actually tell people what is better and why it is better : marketing precedes choice . 
  the point is that most utility is created by direct or indirect marketing not actual utility . 
  i agree with the freedom part , i do n't agree that it will indulge a very lethargic gen y that has absolutely no idea what economic value is . 
  and i doubt that the implementation will actually help the poor due to a faulty crony implementations . 
  how about this : free ubi and half work scedule for +40 year olds that have children . 
  it will free up jobs and capital for the young people and it will also make life more livable at a emotional level not just a material one for people that actually deserve the break . 
  how about a general registry for poor people and govermental subsidiesed complete and nutritious meals on sunday . 
  completely voluntary , at least from the point of view of micronutrients it would be healthier than the average weekly american diet . 
   which traditionally has a greatly positive effect on small/medium size companies . 
  which you are told has a effect on small companies , the thing is that most of those are retail , but the power is in distribution and in the last 30 years in production-distribution . 
  the amount of actual consumer choice is insignificant . 
  ( and government regulations played a important part in this ), 
  donations or freemium products exist only due to excess wealth . 
  without bad jobs payd for with excess money , there is no excess wealth , there is no voluntary economy . 
  gen y forgets it exists not despite of capitalism but because of capitalism . 
   there 's always the option to study something that might be interesting to oneself or that might earn a load of money to be spent on pleasantries . 
  unfortunetly nobody will pay you if you only specialised in a field 2 years ago . 
  experts are shaped by years of work , not months of passionate study . 
  ( except on the internet , ther you can get a masters over a political cycle ) i do n't know , there is absolutely 0 motivation for a corporation to keep a petulant monkey at the counter instead of a machine . 
  i 'm not acusing developers , i 'm accusing marketers . 
  you can have amasing tech , but a competitors good marketing will outsell you - also api development is just an effort to squeeze one more generational performance improvement until the technology allows us to make even smaller transistors and pack even more computing power into a processor . 
  i do n't see the efficiency in choosing not to work . 
  living gratuitously . 
  sustainability - 2400 calories / day and living in a adequate environment . 
  - basic needs given those , people will still be motivated to go to work , for cable , for a phone or for some basic cheap form of entertainment . 
  i was reffering to top shelf phones , the tech is build based on cutting endge technology . 
  bottom end devices are just outdated tech rebraded as economy products . 
   though i do n't own a phone . 
  but i 'm interested in the technology side of things , so i see my fair share of price ranges . 
  it all starts with the best product technology has to offer . 
  then you sell it at a price point where you cover r&d costs and some marketing . 
  software designers will create products that will take advantage of new tech and in doing so boosting the demand for your products . 
  after a tech cycle passes , you basically use the same tech/components to make 3-4 slightly better products aldough they are mostly the same and most of the r&d costs goes into design and marketing . 
  when a new technology comes along , you refubish the previous technology as consumer grade tech , the software is already abundant and the hype is alredy build up in the market and basically paid for . 
  at this stage you start making money of that tech , you finance expansion or get profits , this is when 5 % growth turns into actual profits . 
  by this time the assembly line is 5-6 years and now you finish of your payments on it . 
  most marketing costs are neglisable and it 's done by vendors , and you pay for it in cheap phones . 
  after 2 cycles , you are done , the factory is wobly , the market is oversaturated by your products so you get one last edition out , usually an economy product , you go to town on this , and you usually make a killing with them in china , india or africa . 
  you usually finance some next gen r&d with this money , a new assembly line and so on . 
  fuck nature , talking to trees is boring . 
  public opinion is unavoidable , public policiy should not originated in public ( lowest common denominator ) opinion . 
  no , it 's just a govermental buy back program that makes almost no direct money for companies but you can finance a govermental program with it .

  but `` fuck 'em '' is a bit too much . 
  you got ta understand that different people develop both memetically and genetically ways of coping with different environments . 
  the roma are deeply nomadic and thus very unruly . 
  that 's their problem , that 's why they 're crime prone and do n't integrate properly . 
  but they yield easily to proper authority . 
  if the european states stopped looking at them like at retards and actually understood that they have deep pools of resourcefulness , they 'd make for very productive citizens . 
  meanwhile , the west offers them pity , `` tolerance '' , money when they beg and welfare ( which they abuse crassly ) and the east just wants nothing to do with them because of their bad reputation . 
  they are salvageable and can be extraordinary people . 
  they just need to be told that they ca n't complain and not left to their own devices . 
  if there 's any way for a roma community to be unruly , they will always take it . 
  it 's just how they got to survive this long , as a people . 
  did you again delete your post ? 
  those are some good points . 
  you must not be very familiar with that areas layout . 
  or , of course , i 'm reading waaay too much into that post . 
  but i dunno ... 
  someone tipped 4chan off a couple of days ago that the forums would begin being flooded with child pornography , so that the boards will come under mainstream attack and closed . 
  that , of course , did not happen ( although alleged attempts did pop up , but who can say if those were n't actual 4chan users trying to fake it ) . 
  however , if , if , *** if *** someone was indeed out to get 4chan , the tip off would 've obviously stopped that . 
  and *** if *** that did n't work , this might be the next best thing - *** assuming *** someone had prior knowledge of this attack and was out to get 4chan . 
  which , tbh , would n't be that surprising considering the role they had in disseminating some information and countering some narratives surrounding a specific election . 
  it 's not a coincidence and i 'm starting to feel like shilling is involved on discussions about this on reddit . 
  the message is clear . 
  *** `` attack will happen at this location . 
  '' *** the gun stands in for `` attack '' . 
  think about it . 
  if you were to alert about an incoming attack in a cryptic way , that 's how you 'd do it . 
  the gun can just be a symbol for an attack . 
  it 's a cryptic message . 
  `` violence will happen at this location . '', 
  both `` violence '' and the location are conveyed cryptically . 
  the 4chan post pinpointed the location of the attack . 
  pinpointed . 
  the gun might 've just been a warning that an attack will happen , not that that 's literally the gun with which the attack will happen/happened . 
  the 4chan post happened yesterday , and it pinpointed the location of the attack . 
  pinpointed . 
  the gun might 've just been a warning that an attack will happen , not that that 's literally the gun with which the attack will happen/happened . 
  i used to be a hardcore environmentalist ( still am somewhat ) . 
  that being said : merkel can shove her own finger in her populist arsch . 
  being in the community and being subjected to its economy , but not being into schengen = suffering all of its negatives and seeing none of its benefits . 
  holy mother, 
  it is still very bad alright , but not the same thing . 
  if you want to be hardcore fundamentalist about it , sure , go right ahead . 
  just do n't expect common sense to take you seriously . 
  you actually argue against having more context and nuance when discussing a pretty sensitive issue ... 
  i fel liek we underschtad eacuther, 
  my god you people ... 
  i 'd turn the cheek against anything , but against all you naysayers itt trying to paint the dude as an alt-righter just to discredit him , i 'd get a hold of a belt for you , you drive me insane . 
  just watch the damned interviews and judge for yourself . 
  you clearly have n't so far and you 're talking out of your ass . 
  you 're not making a generic complaint , you are right . 
  whatever `` mark '' they set before , it was nothing but the usual , token crap as they are aware of those issues . 
  this more recent and more powerful rhetoric about the industry is just an attempt at cashing into the trend , nothing more . 
  typical politician crap . 
  well he should use the proper words . 
  not rebrand old ones so he does n't have to bother actually being informed on the subject matter . 
  i completely agree with you . 
  but the premise that i was challenging was that of becoming indistinguishable from the natives . 
  i am glad you posted that , because it helps me make the point that i wanted : cultural compatibility happens on a spectrum . 
  from the ability to become indistinguishable , to that of being perfectly functional to incompatibility . 
  i am not saying that pakistanis are culturally incompatible with the british , just that there are different vectors of compatibility from case to case . 
  and have the pakistani 's become indistinguishable from the natives in the last couple of decades ? 
  not from what i 've seen . 
  so there 's clearly something different going on there . 
  your belittling is not an argument . 
  again , this is why remain lost . 
  this thread entirely misses the takeaway here . 
  it 's precisely because london will be ok almost no matter what that those regions who are already impoverished voted leave . 
  those people feel like they have been impoverished precisely so that london big bucks will prosper eternally . 
  brexit was one of the rarest chances they felt they had to roll back on this , as faulty of a roll back as it is . 
  people antagonizing and vilifying them did nothing but help leave and continue to prove their point now . 
  it does not matter , the narrative must be upheld !, 
  here 's why you 're wrong mate : there are gigantic , enormous benefits to the eu coming from romania joining the club . 
  you wo n't see them . 
  eu investors , big companies , politicians , bankers - they will see them though . 
  the average romanian sees plenty of benefits from being in the eu , but that 's mainly because the politicians have a watchdog ( hardly effective , but better than nothing ) and that the people have a role model . 
  plenty of average romanians also got fucked and plenty still do . 
  from farmers getting their land stolen , to regulations killing certain domestic entrepreneurial initiatives , to forests getting cut up , to forced mergers and acquisitions , to increased corruption by european businesses buying off politicians to name a few . 
  life is a mixture of good and bad . 
  romania is n't in schengen ... 
  does n't matter , ideology and ` my side must be right ' is all that counts . 
  if you 'd do a fairer ( but still unfair ) comparison , like comparing sweden to nyc as they have a similar population , guess who 's coming on top ? 
  what 's happening ? 
  who 's rioting ? 
  this is your last warning : hate trump , fulfill your mandatory quota of 10 shoehorned trump hate posts in discussions that have nothing to do with him .

  does n't surprise me at all . 
  italy was the first to develop a big romanian gypsy diaspora . 
  if you know romanian and/or rromani , italian is the easiest foreign language to learn . 
  that 's ... well , surprisingly accurate ... 
  romania is n't ukraine . 
  it most definitely is . 
  but we 're close to a buffer state , there 's little else that it 's needed for russia to assess us as a threat . 
  they can not actively protect their territorial integrity without buffer states , that is the russian geopolitical woe . 
  as such , russia escalates any potentially troublesome sign to `` awaiting for hostile countermeasures '' and escalates any hostility on a logarithmic scale . 
  they are hyperalert . 
  they do n't like anything so close to them being so in the spotlight and so active , ready for mass mobilisation as romania seemed to be in the last couple of weeks . 
  imo , the best way for romania to deal with russia right now is to strongly reassure them that we have nothing to do with them and try to deflect aggression and be friendly . 
  the west will never perish the ussr through force . 
  it needs to implant into russia that which putin and russian politicians hate the most : dissent .

  i 'm sure if i look at my firewall logs i can draw the conclusion that `` russia '' is at cyberwar with my home upc connection as well .

  you could make this argument about belarus maybe , kazakhstan is a petro-state . 
  belarus ' economy , at least from afar , looks in better shape than russia 's , even . 
   btw after 2007 , i heard so many stories about romanians fascinated by our cuisine i 'm one of those  the reason was in any restaurant i stopped the food was great and the menu very diverse , whereas the image of a romanian restaurant i had back then was that they were serving lazy cook foods only - grilled this and that , chips and two kinds of soup . 
  did i mention it was also * incredibly * cheap ? 
  now , both of these things changed a lot in recent years , but your restaurants are still very good . 
  bulgaria , what 's up ? 
  you have good wines but do n't drink them ? 
  [ yes , i am sure . 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=bancuri+cu+scotieni ), 
  i do n't know about hungary , but in romania the scotsman is the goto cheapskate person in jokes . 
  i also do n't know where it comes from . 
   i mean you would n't actually call feta , mozzarella , ricotta or other types of cheese br\u00e2nz\u0103 , right ? 
  wrong , 
  that would be romanian * r\u00e2nz\u0103 * , as well . 
  i can maybe give one example : romanian government dragged its feet for more than 10 years and is still unable to say a final yes or no to the project . 
  as much as i 'm against it , this is completely unreasonable . 
  problem is `` bringing in that ** particular ** investment '' and `` changing the law ** for you ** '' happens to be rather unconstitutional . 
  equality under law and all that . 
  add to this that any hint of personal interest of the guy ( s ) in charge puts them straight in jail . 
  a competent government would have been able to do what you say no doubt , but ours was all `` rule of law is hard , let 's go shopping '' , and failed .

  ow man , your signs are so much better than what he had . 
  huh ? 
  nowhere does it say ` budget deficit ' . 
  you are right he 's messing that up a bit ( plus no investment , no education/research , etc ) but that 's not the topic here . 
  i 'm more curious about bulgaria , actually . 
  their currency is already pegged to the euro . 
   these people are just mindless nationalists , they have zero understanding of economics , international politics etc. 
  they do n't understand what the consequences of such a union would be . 
  well , it 's a good thing 80 % of the population has you to explain these things ... 
  both , but mostly prices went down . 
  8.2 % decrease instead of the nominal 12 % . 
  low or irrelevant skills for the job , yes . 
  think `` we need a c guy to work on the linux kernel '' and getting `` i have 2 years of php + mysql experience '' . 
  i can only give you my subjective experience from small companies . 
  if 10-12 years ago i had to build a db just to keep track and rate the resumes we received and only call some 10 % of them for an actual interview , and those would be almost always hirable , now it can be a month until i just get a resume that 's not depressing . 
   i do n't think you can count romania as part of the balkans . 
  see ? 
  what 's not to like about serbs ?

  you are using old data . 
  56.8 % moldovans , 23.1 % romanian , 7.6 % ukrainian , etc. 
  you are not wrong , first time i heard albanians speaking i was like whoa , they speak backwards romanian . 
  there is no mutual intelligibility , though . 
  that 's not entirely correct as there are also preventive measures if you 're obstructing the investigation , destroying evidence , planning to flee , etc. 
  that 's decided by a ` rights and liberties ' judge and can include arrest up to 30 days and it has nothing to do legally with the actual charges . 
  this is what 's spun to `` arresting people without a sentence '' by the usual suspects ... 
  ah , i misunderstood the part about being able to fire both then . 
  sure , eventually we 'll have to do that , but i expect stockpiles and manufacturing are the greater concerns . 
  the new development above is in nato 5.56 . 
  those are variants ( m762 , m545 ) it 's not like you can just swap your cartridge with one of a different caliber bullet . 
  you can probably swap a lot of parts , but in terms of logistics i would think it 's the ammo that counts , no ? 
  `` second to none '' of your 2nd dragoons was pretty good too .

  if you compare with the basescu period , the whole `` dictatorship '' , `` political police '' , `` prosecutors republic '' , etc lunacy is essentially dead . 
  the most you get these days is some feeble `` let 's all be reasonable with these prosecutions , now '' . 
  it 's only the accused , like udrea , that sometimes still go full retard , but it 's not getting any traction ( see trust in dna in polls ) . 
   i knew it meant something like that but did n't know the `` origins '' of the word . 
  its origins are [ unknown ] ( http://adatbank.transindex.ro/html/alcim_pdf457.pdf ) , actually . 
  the `` without a home '' explanation is just one of them , and often you 'll be told `` that 's what it actually means in hungarian '' . 
  in any event , it does n't mean anything in romanian . 
  alternate etymologies : `` bez gorod '' ( slavic ) , `` bashkir '' , misheard `` bazd meg '' or other onomatopoeic . 
  but these days we know it 's an insult , you know it 's an insult , so it works as an insult , 
  it 's not the negru-voda one , it 's a new one close to silistra . 
   some roads just are n't used often enough to justify bigger investments . 
  i anticipate this crossing to have a traffic of * at least * 10 cars a year / s. 
  it 's smack in the middle of nowhere , both in . bg and . ro ( even more so ) , and the regular crossing between the city of silistra ( bg ) and the danube ferry to calarasi ( ro ) is ~ 30km away . 
  but i think you 're reading too much into it , the romanian side only has < 1km 4 lane there , then it reverts to 2 lane and connects to the main national road ( dn3 ) which is also 2 lane . 
  it 's super low traffic , being used mostly by locals and the few tourists that want to take the scenic route to the seaside as opposed to the motorway further north . 
  it 's just an amusing pic , that 's all . 
   somewhat of a political support that largely came in the aftermath of his election , though . 
  remember that among the very first things he did ( if not the first ) was that immunity vote stunt , which set the public 's expectations at a certain level as all eyes were on him . 
  noticed how no politician raises his voice against judges or the dna anymore ?

  [ t\u00e2rgovi\u0219te , romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c3%a2rgovi%c8%99te ) .

  this, 
  you know , i know crimeea is a clusterfuck and i think even the west had admitted in closed rooms that russia has some understandable interests in the area but the way it was handled ... fuck . 
  it showed that putin is willing use force and shit on treaties , international law , deals with partners everything to get what it wants . 
  these `` understandable interests '' may be invoked in other cases , in other regions at will and the population will stand by him and i am sure uneducated folks from deep russia would have no moral issues in climbing on a tank ( provided a better paycheck than what 's available in their collapsed monoeconomic towns ) and slay the `` western devils '' with an ak in their right arm and a cross in the left . 
  i say this because i know the mentality of uneducated morons in romania . 
  they can be easily manipulated to serve obscure interests , and they are used at every election to swing political dick . 
  mix with that religion , or worse , political involved religious leaders and you have a very chilly wind coming from the east . . 
  in contrast an educated population , a solid middle class and an active civil society , an objectively informed population would reduce risk for situations where the masses are used as weapons . 
  i really hope there are more russians with common sense and this wo n't evolve further because if it does it 's not going to be a small clash . 
  violence breeds violence and war spreads like wildfire ... 
  the sad part is russians somehow feel obligated to defend their establishment these days , and that puts a very dark shadow on the russian society and mentality . 
  remember how contested was bush back in the days by americans . 
  i would be happy too see that in case of putin , but no ... 
  what did gorbachev do ? 
  get one or a group of european mp to put forward a legislation project . 
  slowly grind and win more mp 's , wait years for it to gain traction and enough votes , negotiate all the issues raised by various states and finally put it to a vote and win by margin of a few votes ...  or something like that, 
  a paneuropean fbi with jurisdisctions beyond that of interpol ... that would be something ... 
  well , we 're eastern and orthodox and certainly putin is not our hero , so serbs should speak for themselves ... 
  well , i 'd say the retarded one would be the one who does n't understand a simple phrase which state that brits `` seem '' retarded , not that they are ... 
  brits are are going out of their way to seem retarded lately . 
  do n't be . 
  politicians are scum all over the planet . 
  i said happier ... 
  oh but there is . . because it 's not all about having more and better . . stuff . 
  it 's not necessary about standard of living ( although that matters a lot too ) . 
  it 's about the fact that people in the west are happier , leave fuller lives , are healthier more caring and friendly with each other on a medium . 
  from the perspective of the individual that is , i guess , the main objective . 
  to live a happy live . 
  the answer was given numerous times . 
  autonomy on ethnic principles is unacceptable . 
  the hungarian minority is represented at the highest level in romania , the hungarian party udmr being present in governments all but a few of the last 25 years , defending the rights of this minority . 
  romania is an exemplary state regarding minority rights , and the romanian people are one of the most tolerant in all europe . 
  hateful speech , extremism , antisemitism , racism , xenophobism , fascism etc are condemned and not allowed in the civilized world . 
  i do n't know where you live but you might start thinking to find a place to move if such a thing is encouraged in your country . 
  we still have a lot to go before refusing entry for the president like slovakia . 
  it shows that we do not condone and tolerate such behaviour like all of civilized europe . 
  what the hungarians do in their country it 's their business and these individuals were not in official duty while here . 
  there 's no row . 
  it 's just a bunch of extremist assholes being forbidden to enter the country to pick a fight . 
  this is just like with football hooligans . 
  i think that would be a good idea , but i do n't see the political vision at home for this to happen . 
  i think russians have inflicted more `` loot , plunder and rape '' on themselves than any other nation did or could do . 
  and they also inflicted it on others ( the amount vs others is debatable but does n't make it excusable on any size ), 
  and let 's not forget the complete loss of credibility . 
  nobody will deal with the russian the same way for decades . 
  as for germany , as long as they play both ends they will get continuous fire in the eu and that can weaken their position as dominant shots caller . 
  they will play it very , very safe . 
  the french are waiting for a chance to step to the podium again . 
  i think if by miracle russia would be conquered by americans or europeans you would be better off . 
  you are the biggest country on the planet , have practically unlimited resources , a strong human capital and yet have an economy the size of the uk . 
  you have no excuse to preach to the world nothing as long as you do n't show the world a better societal model . 
  that 's romania , and bulgaria , and much of poland , some parts of hungary , maybe croatia too and i 'm sure of others . . 
  as a romanian this is reassuring . 
  the situation in eastern europe is indeed very complicated . 
  there are dozens of ethnic groups concentrated in this zone . 
  this is the reason so many wars stated here . 
  it is a very fragile stability , achieved with lots of blood spill , and everybody here is sick of war and turmoil . 
  yeah , basically you must implement all the laws , but do n't have a vote . 
  it sucks , but i totally understand your position . 
  iceland has the same issues regarding fishing , that 's why they have close the negotiations this round . 
  that is an epic understatement !, 
  you fail so hard you win an upvote !, 
  do n't let numbers fool you . 
  eu 's defense budget , besides being smaller is spread thinner , less efficiently and on inferior technology . 
  the true test of eu 's defense resolve was lybia . 
  it showed us clearly that the eu has real difficulties in projecting hard power even on relatively close operation theaters . 
  as to eastern states fear , let me paint a picture of how real it is . 
  i live in romania . 
  near us to the east lies moldova , the second romanian state . 
  moldova is a part of the historical province with the same name ( the other half which resides in romanian borders is also . 
  naturally called moldova ) . 
  it has been anexed in 1940 by the soviets which proceeded with an accelerated russification of this territory . 
  presently they have a significant russian minority . 
  with the same tactics the russian have started a separatist conflict on the estern border in transnistria where there are more russians . 
  romania hopes that sometimes in the future the two states would unite similar to the german model . 
  the roadmap for this as romania is integrated in western structures would , at first be , moldova 's eu ascension . 
  and this year moldova managed to sign , as ukraine was preparing to , the eu trade agreeement . 
  this was received by the russians with the same approach as it has been in ukraine . 
  the deal went through , but in light of the recent events i do n't think they will let it slide . 
  they are just momentarily preoccupied with ukraine . 
  they can always ignite the frozen conflict in transnistria , which will make eu ascension impossible . 
  a lot of moldova 's citizens are also romanian citizens by birthright and by blood right . 
  so you see how russian actions has an impact on eu citizens , and plans directly . 
  it 's hard for people in countries that had not deal with the russians to understand what a plague they 've been and why a lot of the eastern bloc is allergic and paranoid about them . . edit : also the us supports the defense effort of romania and poland for example a lot stronger than the eu . 
  being more independent of the us is the last thing countries like romania and poland want . 
  romanian here . 
  same feeling here . 
  was just talking with friends about the fact that we need additional security besides nato . 
  if shit hits the fan i have serious doubts that french or brits would send their sons to die for poles and romanians . 
  i 'm also distrustful of germany as they are dealing with the russian over eastern europe 's head , as always . 
  do you think a military alliance in the eastern block would make sense ? 
  all easterners suffer from it . 
  civilizational impotence guilt trip i guess . 
  why the fuck would the eu would want to become more independent of the us . 
  i 'm baffled . 
  you do realize the us , momentarily , is our army ? 
  you do realize that the shit russians are pulling in crimea is applicable in multiple regions ? 
  i guess tusk is right . 
  can germany not see that the entire eastern block has serious concerns over security ? 
  i do n't think it will come to this .

  england would be to the fuk ( former united kingdom ) the same as russia is to the fsu . 
  so yeah , all the overseas territories , bases and other shit would most likely go to england by default . 
  we feel you , do n't worry . 
  if the french people voted fn into power it would make the british leave supporters look like progressive intellectuals by comparison , so yeah , doubt it 's going to happen . 
  well , it does have its own budget , so i assume ( not sure though ) it can run its own deficit . 
  that would probably the most epic troll in the history of any democratic country . 
  i 'm sure farage would do it though , if he ever became pm . 
  i do n't know whether i should be happy that the dumb blonde is being replaced by another dumb blonde who is also fascist and has less sense of humor . 
  i mean , may would have probably become pm anyway , but now her chances have went from ~ 70 % to 99 % ( the 1 % being odd chances like sudden death/serious illness or saying something so incredibly retarded that it would amount to political suicide ) . 
  yeah , but what about the animal 's freedom ? 
  it ca n't consent to being fucked , so it 's pretty much rape . 
  do you drink mona ? 
  if you do n't drink mona you are noobs . 
  zoophilia is legal in finland ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  at least you closed the pr0n tabs before taking the screenshot . 
  well , if the euro blows up , pretty much everyone is going to be in deep shit , i 'm not denying that . 
  however , being able to control our own deficit and not having to pay to bail out other countries sounds like a good deal to me , for the time being . 
  also , if the euro does blow up , even though it 's not going to be pretty for the romanian economy , being outside of it will still be better than having to reverse to national currency in a matter of months . 
  and what happens if the players on the field simply ignore what uefa says and hold a moment of silence ? 
  he is an opportunist and a demagogue , he does n't care about anything as long as his ratings go up . 
  he 's sort of like trump , only cares about personal success . 
  i 'm sure many people would like to be in farage 's position even if they do n't share his views . 
  just like a pornstar , who cares if you have to ride 1000 cocks , at the end of the day you get paid a lot more than the average joe doing a much easier job . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/digi24/actualitate/stiri/dacian+ciolos+voluntar+la+strans+gunoaie+in+parcul+natural+vacar ), 
  good , i really do n't want us to join the euro , but our national bank is pushing this like it 's some kind of huge national priority . 
  for all i care , the euro can wait for a couple of more decades , if it 's still alive by then , then we can join it . 
  it 's ironic how farage is against the so-called establishment , because it 's the establishment who made him rich . 
  had he not been an mep , he would probably be trading penny stocks right now , or even be the low grade bank clerk he saw in rumpoy . 
  i honestly think farage is the sort of guy who repeats his bullshit in the mirror ten times to make sure he sounds believable when he makes a speech . 
  i do n't know about commercial spaces , but where exactly can you rent a 45 m2 apartment in bucharest for less than $ 300 , in cluj you can ... 
  of course he wo n't , the stupid ape has no concept of responsibility for his own actions . 
  yeah but bucharest is ugly as fuck , the traffic is horrendous and the people are rude . 
  also , the rents are pretty ridiculous , why would they want to open a business in bucharest , when they can open one in timisoara or cluj and pay half the rent they would in bucharest ? 
  yea , but you have shitty internet speeds . 
  i doubt most people would know where to place cameroon on a map . 
  or they 'd think you 're talking about david cameron ... 
  kind of reminds me of romania during the commie times , a few days before ceausescu visited any place , everyone was hard at work cleaning everything , fixing potholes , cutting the grass , planting flowers etc. 
  after he left , in a few days everything would look like shit again . 
  yes , switzerland is doing `` just fine '' because it 's filthy rich , not because it 's a direct democracy . 
  and if you think switzerland being filthy rich has anything to do with it 's direct democracy you are delusional , it has mostly to do with the fact that it 's the biggest and most famous tax haven and money laundry in the entire fucking world . 
   censor.net.ua is censored ( forbidden and blocked ) in russian federation ... use a vpn maybe ? 
  [ what moldova thinks of this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s78id7fiyfu ), 
  well , it 's becoming less and less likely that the uk govt . 
  is going to trigger article 50 in the near future , so the shitstorm is merely being delayed , not avoided . 
  personally , i believe in every country in the world there are some people for whom the normal rules simply do n't apply . 
  not saying they ca n't go to prison under any circumstances , just that there 's a lot of shit they can get away with that other people would be immediately thrown in jail for . 
  you do n't have to be a conspiratard to notice this . 
  of course he thinks it 's wonderful , his low quality tabloids have been pushing anti-eu propaganda since like forever . 
  soros has also made a ton of money from brexit . 
  yeah , but replacing a vast amount of workers with robots that do n't have to pay taxes is not very sustainable in the long term , it 's basically worse than mass migration . 
  the social tensions between the rich and the poor would reach a boiling point , and the rich know better to learn from history , they do n't want another communist revolution . 
  the title is misleading , she never said `` close friends '' . 
  what she said was `` i have , let 's call them that , `` friends '' , whom i 've known for 10 years who were close to offering to help me pack my bags '' . 
  she was ironic when she said friends and never said they offered to help her pack her bags , just that they were `` close to offering it '' , so they were probably hinting how excited they were at the prospect of her leaving . 
  well erdogan is pretty despotic , it does n't seem to work well against terrorists though ... 
  istanbul is partly in europe , specifically , the airport is in europe . 
  fuck , my gf was there last week . 
  she 's in shock . 
  i 'm just crossing out turkey from my list of countries to visit . 
  how did this happen though , afaik , the istanbul airport is full of security personnel and they always seem on edge compared to other airports ? 
  everything except the populus poll where pretty close . 
  it was a close result anyway , there 's no way you can predict an outcome if the society is so divided about it . 
  i think he was piss drunk when he did that one . 
   in a few weeks it 's marching season where unionists march and sing offensive songs about nationalists . 
  wow , i thought the tensions have died down since the 1990s . 
  is there any risk for violence at those marches ? 
  it 's kind of the same thing that is happening with moldova . 
  tons of people apply every year for romanian passports even if they are pro-russian and romanian law ca n't deny them , because everyone who has at least one grandparent born in moldova before it was annexed by the ussr is still entitled to romanian citizenship . 
  i wish pro-russians would be denied romanian passports , but as they say , you ca n't have your cake and eat it . 
   lost trade with the eu will mean lower demand , and that will need to be compensated for by domestic demand . 
  i assume you mean domestic supply . 
  sure , sounds great in theory , but it 's difficult to increase domestic supply when the costs of labour are going up because you no longer have poles working for 5 punds an hour and many investors thinking how to gtfo our of the uk . 
  the harsh reality is that despite all its opt-outs , the uk has become very entangled with the eu in the last 4 decades and breaking that relationship is going to be very painful . 
  it 's only fair to expel people if they start acting like social parasites . 
  it 's not fair to expel people if they have the means to support themselves and contribute to the economy . 
  usually , when the economy is having a hiccup , governments either raise taxes or cut spending , you know it 's really bad when they 're doing both at the same time . 
  they only ones who were bluffing were the leave campaigners . 
  i would find it hard myself to act in professional manner being in the same room with a man like farage . 
  he is like that kid sitting in the back of the class , always giggling , pranking other students , mocking the teachers etc. 
  of course , a teacher has the authority to kick such a student out of the class , but the ep ca n't kick farage out and everyone has a limit . 
  farage only cares about his own party/image , he does n't care how much his antics will hurt britain 's position in the negotiations , all he knows is that his voters love his clownery . 
  hate verhofstadt as much as you like , but he was right when he said the biggest waste of money is the salary the eu is paying to farage . 
  what a twat !, 
  basically the first thing brexiters said on friday morning was that they wanted to have `` informal negotiations '' before they trigger article 50 . 
  juncker basically told them to fuck off . 
  hah , we beat all of our neighbors . 
  how come greece and ukraine are n't considered total junk tho ? 
   in western countries not generally no . 
  the reason being that downgrades happen when the economy is n't doing great . 
  when the economy is n't doing great investors put money into bonds since they are safe investments . 
  more investors buying bonds lowers rates . 
  i do n't understand , why would they invest in bonds if the interest rates are already very low ? 
  also , if the uk were to leave to single market , imported goods would become more expensive , thus generating inflation , not to mention the pound is n't very stable right now either . 
  yeah , good theory , only that poster is not made by the dutch , just some butthurt hungarian living in the netherlands . 
   what kind of schizo made it ? 
  a hungarian , obviously . 
  you do realize numbers will be different if the uk no will no longer have free movement of people , right ? 
  not to mention it 's a low cost airline , so it 's customers are people that are likely to be hit the hardest by any limitation to the free movement of people . 
  just some butthurt hungarian living in the netherlands , apparently he did [ something similar ] ( http://imgur.com/a/zmhve ) when there was the ukraine deal referendum .

  where are the foreign embassies to lecture the italians about this ? 
  you 're welcome .

  this is good news . 
  since the austrian transvestite , i 've come to the conclusion that the less points you have , the saner you are . 
  ah , another useful idiot ... nah , that 's too kind , you 're a brain-dead zombie : 5,1 millions votes for  7,4 million votes against . 
   the romanian constitution requires a turnover of over 50 % to consider the vote for impeaching the president as valid . 
  the turnover was 46 % . 
  16.2 million was recorded as being ~ ~ able ~ ~ eligible to vote , adults as young as 18 years of age . 
  moreover , you 're purposefully ignore * erata * : only in hell and heaven are 22 or 20 of us , total . 
  let 's not forget about those who , at that time , were n't able to vote in great numbers outside the country ( due to great lenghts and distances ) and let 's not forget the minors & dead people considered eligible to vote ( which they are not , but the registered forms at the referendum were otherwise ) . 
  he forgot to thank the dead for his `` winning '' . 
  the only way , in your head and others ' brain-deads , is that we 're * at least * 19.5 million population , and that every one of them are eligible to vote , dead or alive , adults or minors . 
  so much so , that you probalby forgot , he found himself in such a low , degenerate position , that the actual presence at the vote by his useful idiots and brai-dead zombies was a lot more dangerous that the vote itself to protect him . 
  but that 's a fairly unknown nuance to others , is it . 
   ponta and antonescu then attempted to castrate the constitutional court via an emergency government ordinance and changed the referendum law so that the president could be impeached by 50 % +1 of votes regardless of turnover . 
  that 's false . 
  the reasoning behind the 50 % +1 vote is as old as early as 2006-2007 ( for the wrong reasons at that time and discussion ) . 
  moreover , the referendum was n't about removing a mayor or a city/county counselorship , it was about removing a president ( with very grave mental illnesses , since he declared himself winner with 7,4 million punches in the nose ) . 
  for whatever reasons there were , one of them , in terms of eligibility is that it was required at least half the population to remove him ( which happened , but overturned by foreigners ) to justify it accordingly with and in the spirit of the constitution . 
  of course , all it took was a couple of foreign implications to spit on each and every voter who wanted him down . 
  the only ones that decided the referendum was valid were his cronies , that 's it , with zegrean as the spearhead . 
  while the constitution itself is pretty adamant on some issues that happened . 
  interesting how 7,4 million votes are invalid for his removal but 5,1 million for his support are valid as crystal water . 
  just another nuance . 
   it was ponta and antonescu who attempted a coup ( and failed ) , not basescu . 
  show me the guns , explosives and terrorists . 
  too late and he wo n't be in jail . 
  two reasons : 1 - when the referendum for his downfall ( which were 7.4 million votes against him ; the highest ever recorded in this country 's history ; compared with him being elected with just over 5.1 million votes ) was basically overturned - a coup d'etat - with the help from * foreign embassies * and * foreign implications * , and also thanks to his cronies that he handpicked for positions within the justice system . 
  now , as irony , he complains about the current affairs within the justice system which he , himself , helped to create . 
  2 - even after he has retired after his 2nd term , without any surprise , everybody that was around him was , more or less , `` halted '' for corruption , fraud , theft etcetera ( including his brother ) but not all of them , even those whom were `` halted '' were n't booked for actual hearings , actual dossier case , or actual trial for conviction . 
  nothing was made to this day by those whom were hippity-hoppy on preventative arrest/detention ; but it was a lot of tv circus with hand-cuffs , no proofs , no evidence , no nothing ... no actual work from prosecutors ... just some weeks or months spent in a cell and that 's it . 
  you have to prove your innocence ( not the other way around , btw ) and you 're guilty until proven innocent . 
  it has become so stupid , so excessive , and stalinistic , that a lot of people ( indifferent or misinformed on these matters ) *** do not know the difference *** between * a trial court * ( actual trial , actual justice , actual conviction ) & * preventative arrest/detention * ( not actual trial , not actual justice , not actual conviction ; just circus for tv and for morons to believe that `` justice has been served '' ) . 
  to make matters worse , the perception is that mps and senators have this so-called `` immunity from prosecution '' or `` immunity from justice '' . 
  ** they 're not immune from being prosecuted and they 're not immune from serving time in prison , no , they are excepted from these machiavellian-stalinistic preventative arrests and preventative detention . 
  btw , the only person in this country , with absolute immunity from justice , is the president . 
  he can kill someone and not be prosecuted . 
  it 's very rudimentary and very regressive , yes . 
  and this son of a whore , ex-serviceman ( he worked for ceausescu 's * die * ; which was the equivalent of the * cia * or * dia/dcs * ) , has external protection without any shadow of a doubt . 
  that 's why he wo n't be facing the rest of his life behind bars .

   in another stinging attack , the presenter said the french government 's decision to fund the study of french in north african nations was akin to a `` form of imperialism '' . 
   he added : `` the truth is that while other imperial powers were running down their flags around the world , france never really decolonised . '' that is pinpoint accurate . 
  both countries have their overseas territories ( islands ) , but there 's a bargain in africa which is ... deplorable .

  original source :  a russian `` news '' paper . 
  seems legit . 
  might as well say russian foreign ministry , would they ever lie about anything ? 
  you do know russia already has troops in transnistria right ? 
  about 1500 soldiers i think . 
  you ca n't make this shit up , this article should be tagged as `` not the onion '' the irony is so strong . 
  in that case you 'll probably wo n't need the notice from the swiss tax office , but you might want to ask for one anyway , just in case . 
  when you say that ... do you mean you 'll be in international waters ? 
  because if you 're going to be in some port than that wo n't matter . 
  yes you will be able to bring your money over , you 'll have to pay swiss income taxes . 
  if during this time you 'll be living in switzerland than that will be that , if on the other hand during these 6 ( 12 ) months you 'll still have residency in france , than in that case you 'll have to ask the swiss tax authority to give you some type of legal notice that will tell the french tax authority that the money you 've earned in switzerland already had taxes payed on it . 
  the swiss tax office should know what you 're asking since there are many people working in switzerland , but actually live in france , italy or germany . 
  perhaps russia should stop vandalizing neighboring countries before it talks about what somebody else should do .

  please tell me you 're from cluj , it would make this so perfect . 
   geman-influenced communities in transylvania tend to be more prosperous than the romanian ones . 
  the reason they are more prosperous is because historically they were richer and had easier and faster access to western innovations , this kind of thinking is a perfect example of of the `` post hoc ergo propter hoc '' logical fallacy , also known as correlation does not imply causation . 
  let me guess , you 're one of the kind that dreams at night about transylvanian autonomy or independence ? 
  even if he is it 's still a very stupid thing to say , but that 's besides the point , since when you say `` only good things in romania '' you do n't mean just one thing . 
   and another is about the current state of affairs in the union . 
  if we apply a little hindsight we will see that admitting romania , bulgaria and the baltic was an error . 
  their admission was a political move rather than economical . 
  what ? 
  an error for who exactly ? 
  you 're talking out of your ass right now . 
   i guess you have to leave political office if you dont want that comment to be career suicide . 
  sad but so true . 
  being a candidate does not mean you 're in the eu , just ask turkey about that .

  from what i 've noticed about these catalan people on reddit , they have an incredibly inflated opinion of the importance of catalonia for the eu . 
  i have no idea why that is , but they are convinced that the eu ca n't function if catalonia would n't be in the eu , as such the eu would n't risk saying no to admission for catalonia . 
  that 's the narrative , i 've never managed to get a reason on why they think catalonia is so important . 
  finland might what ? 
  finland has been part of the eu since 1995 . 
  no , i do n't know what you mean . 
  the entire concept is absurd from beginning to end . 
  after this reply , i think i should post it again , since clearly even the second time the joke went so far over your head it might as well have been that missile that shot down the plane . 
  you might have confused it with nato , croatia and albania joined nato in 2009 . 
  but really ... can i just see some proof , any proof really ? 
  it 's all rumors and lies , the ukrainian government lies just as much as the russians , also the us invaded iraq . 
  well i know who 's going to have a polonium heart attack next . 
  albania is n't a member of the eu you do know that right ? 
  nor is it likely it will be a member of the eu within the next 10 years at least . 
   the only good things in romania are a result of german influence . 
  i doubt that . 
  only country i see joining before 2020 is montenegro and maybe iceland ( if they decide they want to ) , i doubt anyone else will qualify or be allowed to join to be honest . 
  juncker said there wo n't be an expansion in the next 5 years . 
  not to mention that moldova ca n't join until the whole transnistria thing gets settled and it does n't look anymore settled now than it was 20 years ago . 
  the consumers have no fucking money , because they either do n't have any fucking jobs or those that still do had to take a massive wage cut because the only way to reduce costs for a country in the eurozone is internal devaluation . 
  when you have no money and no jobs it does n't fucking matter if a fucking tv costs 100 or 1000 euros do you fucking understand now ? 
  even if everything you said were true , which by the way it is n't , that does n't mean it would n't be preferable to the current situation . 
  the eurozone is playing with deflation currently , southern europe has been doing internal devaluation for years now , for them it does n't matter that the price of oil stayed the same , if they had less money or no money because they have no jobs . 
  that map seems very off , does n't fit with any map from any other site . 
  five years ? 
  that 's ... optimistic . 
  my estimate is somewhere around 15-20 years if the will for reform is there . 
  i 'm pretty sure that belarus has a better chance of joining the eu before turkey . 
  to be honest , i actually think that if germany left the ez things would be rough for a year or two , but would actually settle down and it would fix the issues . 
  at that point the euro would drop in value , since germany ( and a few other nations , but germany being by far the biggest ) keep the euro overvalued in relation to the economies of southern europe , another thing would be that whatever currency germany would have at that point ( probably bringing back the dm ) it would rise in value and make germany 's exports more expensive , since the euro is still undervalued in relation to the german economy . 
  that 's a myth , the value of the oil traded in dollars when compared with the total value of all dollars in the market is nothing but a drop in the bucket . 
  petrodollar is one part history two parts fiction . 
  by not doing anything the ecb is doing what germany wanted and when doing nothing became politically impossible since the ecb is supposed to protect the eurozone and not germany than those german busy bodies that ca n't think passed `` inflation '' quit . 
  as it stands , the ecb has n't been doing anywhere near enough simply because germany wo n't let it and the rest of the central banks are to chicken shit to outvote wiedemann . 
  it absolutely did pass the issue to the ecj , by saying it does n't have competence in this matter and referred the issue to the ecj the issue passed to the ecj . 
  how is that hard to understand ? 
   so , the gcc is of the opinion that the ecb is breaking its mandate , but since ruling on this issue is outside of its jurisdiction , it referred that case to the ecb . 
  the gcc 's opinion on something that they have no competence over is as valid and significant as mine , which is to say none at all . 
   if that were the case , how come the german ecb head analyst and the former bundesbank president both resigned , because thry felt they could not endorse the repeated breaking of the ecb mandate ? 
  why the fuck should i care why somebody quits ? 
   how come wiedemann , the current president of the bundesbank has repeatedly abstained from voting because of political reasons while harshly critizing the actions of the ecb ? 
  again , why wiedemann does anything does n't interest me , he only represents the bundesbank , what i care about is what the ecb does . 
   stop trying to take they easy way out and blame everything on germany . 
  in this particular case it absolutely is germany 's fault and the ecb 's fault for not protecting the eurozone 's interest and mostly looking out for germany 's . 
  it 's really fucking easy to say that when you 're sitting in the rich part of europe , enjoying the fruits of a cheaper euro , no inflation while not suffering from internal devaluation . 
  i 'd bet you would n't be so `` rational '' about this if you were living in italy or spain . 
   how do you know its working in the long term sense ? 
  i do n't , but clearly it worked in a short and medium term with nothing to say it wo n't in the long term , however austerity clearly has n't worked at all . 
   he preaches the easy tale of qe . 
  oh you mean the thing that is working in the us ? 
  yeah , shame on him for suggesting the ecb do the same thing the fed did . 
  because the other central banks are scared to overrule it , even though they actually have the votes required to do it . 
  they are afraid to use the power they have , as such germany can bully them around . 
   the ecb is basing its monetary policy on what germany wants . 
  we are learning that this is n't what germany needs . 
  absolutely true , but until now the difference between what it `` needs '' and what it `` wants '' was n't that visible , a slowdown in germany might be exactly what the eurozone needs in the medium to long term , as bad as that would be on the short term . 
  i pretty much agree with everything you said , however my concern is that this will lead to deflation , which is already a real risk as the situation stands .

  that means you 're a patriot then , not a nationalist . 
  a nationalist considers his nation to be superior to everyone else and is based on resentment towards other countries . 
  you ca n't properly cooperate with anyone else if you keep thinking your nation is superior and better than anyone else 's . 
  maintaining culture , identity and soverignty is patriotism . 
  when you think it 's easy to get them out , remember hitler too was elected democratically . 
  these people , once they get a taste of power they will try to change laws and constitutions to ensure their cling to power , there are some current examples , look at putin in russia , erdogan in turkey or viktor orban in hungary . 
  of course i 'm not saying that every person who voted for the far right desires a weaker eu and likes putin . 
  however the far right feeds mostly on nationalistic feelings which always brings bad things . 
  i know many countries in europe have suffered economically over the last few years , but is voting for the far right really a solution ? 
  far right parties promote themselves by propaganda , exagerating facts , distorting the truth and blame all the problems on some boogeyman like immigration . 
  imho , it 's really easy for one of these parties to gain a majority in some countries and from that moment on , it will be extremely tough to get them out as they are n't big fans of democracy and freedom . 
  i think it 's perfectly legitimate for the eu to have it 's own interests just like the us , russia and china have their own interests . 
  however those interests must be promoted without breach of international law . 
  the eu did n't break international law `` by acting provocatively '' , however russia did by annexing crimea . 
  while they might come up with excuses for the situation in donetsk and lugansk , they had no excuse and no legal base for annexing crimea . 
  that was just a purely imperialistic and expansionist act , that was in breach of international law and agreements that russia was part of . 
  hmmm , interesting thing about the electoral action of poles in lithuania , similarly , they use the gagauz people in moldova , whose leader is also very pro-russian as well even though logically they should be pro-turkey . 
  edit : i did n't know russia still had such a powerful influence in lithuania, 
  it was n't the eu who annexed crimea ... 
  the fsb is well established across europe , i 'm sure they have many proxies with no apparent connection to moscow . 
  still , what 's the point of making threats you obviously ca n't follow through ? 
  ( like nuking an eu and nato member ), 
  eastern romania has the same murder rate as moldova ? 
  now i see why they make daily prime time news lol, 
  yeah , the polish fm is such an attention whore , surely he recorded himself then posted it on the web . 
  transnistria is a pariah state , they will eventually be annexed either by moldova or ukraine . 
  frankly i think russia is too scary to be included in the eu . 
  i think the cis countries consider themselves eurasian . 
  maybe `` united states of greater austria '', 
  well if you impose a language , that can be a start to impose other things . 
  the maine difference between the ussr and eu is n't that the ussr was communist and the eu is not , but it 's that the ussr tried to create uniformity by attempting to russify everyone . 
  people have a lot of pride in their languages and doubt they would democratically agree on a dominant language . 
  i can hardly see the french accepting english as their official language . 
  this is the 21st century , i do n't think an european federation needs to be a copy of the us . 
  if there will ever be a common language in europe , it will probably be english , for obvious reasons . 
  but i do n't think it should ever be de jure , just de facto . 
  if a language was to be made de jure official language of europe , how would the eu be any different from the ussr ? 
  nothing new here , the kgb ( fsb ) has been busy leaking quite a lot of shit lately . 
  antena 3 is n't representative of the whole media . 
  antena 3 used every possible opportunity to bash basescu and he still became president twice and survived 2 impeachment attempts . 
  yeah , but they have good infrastructure and industry . 
  belarus 's per capita gdp is actually comparable to romania 's, 
  yeah i remember when the illegal transnistrian did n't even let him visit his mother 's grave . 
  he has so much bad karma around him , basically everyone hates him except for the poor bastards that still vote for his party . 
  i do n't think he 'll make any miracles . 
  i also do n't think anyone should vote him or not based on ethnic background . 
  it just that he seems to have better manners than ponta , for example and i doubt he 'd embarrass romania like basescu did . 
  it 's also that sibiu looks better than many cities in romania , so i think this guy would take hisjob seriously . 
  most importantly he ca n't be worse than ponta . 
  victor ponta , known for : plagiarising his doctorate and not even having the decency to admit it . 
  supported super immunity of mps and amnesty for criminals . 
  said he will recognise kosovo as soon as he becomes president ( which is against the will of the majority of romanians ) . 
  he seems to have made a secret deal with the democratic union of hungarians , otherwise i ca n't explain their support for him as president . 
  oltchim scandal . 
  generally having a bad reputation in europe after trying to impeach the president along with crin antonescu back in 2012 . 
  roads are not nearly as bad as they used to be . 
  even though romania has only around 600 km of motorways , the roads are very good by eastern european standards . 
  as long as you stay clear of back country roads , you should be fine . 
  well poland 's image did improve over time . 
  also the image of irish people and italians in the us did eventually improve . 
  if romania is able to reduce corruption and close the gap between it 's economic condition and that of western europe , maybe in 20 or so years , the image might change . 
  maybe he is , but seems to have something most other politicians lack , common sense . 
  with all of putin 's wet dreams of world domination ? 
  not yet ready for the us to leave ... 
  the uk is pretty much a us puppet state , that 's why they want out of the eu . 
  a strong eu goes against the interests of the us , even if they do n't state it publicly . 
  if that ever happens , i can easily see nigel farage jumping before everyone else , even putin , to scream about the `` invasion '' of moldovans in the uk . 
  same goes when talking about russia . 
  europe is not united , that 's why their scared to say anything to the us or russia . 
  maybe if it was n't for all those far-right groups , europe would actually have a chance of becoming a geopolitical power . 
  i 'd rather like to see russia become a more european country than breaking up ... russians are not bad people , they have been living under autocratic governments for pretty much all their history , they still lack the enlightenment europe has been through . 
  when that will happen , i believe they can become civilised like the rest of europe . 
  belarus is much more developed than moldova , there 's no question about it . 
  although it 's pretty much a dictatorship , it 's still far from being north korea though . 
  romanian average net wage 2007 - 312 euros moldova average net wage 2014 - 194 euros not quite the same , also moldova has had a higher inflation rate than romania, 
  as much as i 'd like to see that happen , the problem is that russia still has a lot of nukes , i doubt anyone would want to see part of those nukes fall in the hands of some islamic caliphates . 
  well , viktor orban is obviously a wan na be dictator and he knows dictatorships have no place in europe , with russia being the only country that openly supports shit-hole dictatorships . 
  moldova would bring a lot of problems to romania and the union would have almost no benefits for romania . 
  with all their pro-russian minorities , with the transnistrian problem , all those communists and anti-romanians , poverty , no natural resources etc. 
  i do n't see a single reason romania would want to unite with moldova . 
  the same language , same people bullshit is being used by politicians , because well , right now around 800,000 moldovans have romanian passports , thus are able to vote in romanian elections and also by die-hard , far-right ultra-nationalists , but for them , union with moldova is just a priority among others ( like cleansing romania of hungarians , gypsies , homosexuals ) . 
  by blood voronin is romanian , however his step-father was a convinced pro-soviet communist . 
  yeah but said dissolution was n't quite as bad in other former ussr countries ... not even in ukraine . 
  i think the soviets never intended to develop moldova because they thought it might eventually reunite with romania . 
  however a big problem of the moldovan society is that they act almost like a nation of beggars . 
  they are nostalgic of the soviet times , when in reality the only difference was that they were subsidised by the soviets . 
  ever since independence , their leaders begged either romania , russia or other western countries for economic aid . 
  even former communist president vladimir voronin , who is , along with igor dodon and iurie muntean , one of the most notorius anti-romanian in moldova , was being friendly towards the romanian president back in 2005 . 
  yeah well , that 44 % sure explains the large number of luxury cars in the capital . 
  i knew about poroshenko speaking romanian , but not about yatsenyuk though ( guess it makes sense , since he is from chernivitsi ), 
  political instability started a few months ago , moldova 's decline started 23 years ago . 
  if what you 're saying is true , than how is it that all cis members ( except russia which has huge reserves of natural resources ) are much worse off than even the newest countries in the eu . 
  if you compare poland or romania with britain , they are poor , but if you compare them to ukraine , belarus , armenia etc. 
  ( not even mentioning the stans ) they are paradise . 
  this is another problem i forgot to mention . 
  romania offers scholarships to moldovan students but many of them abandon the studies before finishing them , and among those that finish , very few actually return to moldova , preferring to work in romania or somewhere else in europe . 
  i would n't say they are stupid , but surely brainwashed . 
  sorry but this is like saying , `` yeah zimbabwe kinda sucks , but they offer great safari tours '' , it 's not touching the subjects that we discuss . 
  i do n't think there 's going to be one politician that would agree to give up power just to unite with romania , regardless of what he considers himself . 
  the situation is much different with that of germany , russia did n't oppose german unification , but it did oppose romanian unification , with the pretext for transnistrian separatism being that moldova 's unification with romania was imminent and transnistria did n't want to be a part of that ( they used the exact same propaganda they use today in ukraine , saying romanians were fascists and all the typical kremlin bullshit ) .

  greece asks for more money . 
  ecb/imf does n't want to give more money without guarantees that it 's not yet another dump in a black hole . 
  even if you cut their debt they 're still broke . 
  did greece not get a $ 100 billion debt cut from private creditors in early 2012 ? 
  did greece not get another $ 40 billion debt cut from official creditors in early 2013 ? 
  are all these news websites lying to me ?

  he transferred ikea to his foundation to avoid tax . 
  i 've seen these in the past and always thought it 's a question of time until someone gets seriously hurt . 
  here 's one that was in the news earlier this year . 
  so half of romanians should throw their passports away and go to denmark . 
  jk , they ca n't afford passports anyway . 
  custody is used whenever there 's suspicion someone could interfere with an active investigation . 
  such as a manager destroying incriminating evidence . 
  it does n't work like that here . 
  eu law is more like a guideline . 
  states still need to pass their own laws . 
  i 'm pretty sure the driver was attacked , not her . 
  do n't forget to throw away your id & passport, 
  i 've tried living in a country where austerity cut wages by 25 % and purchasing power by 60 % for state employees . 
  ** overnight ** . 
  ireland and portugal do n't know what austerity means . 
  neither did greece until ~ 2012 when the n-th austerity package hit . 
  eu/imf were stupid to give them money under the initial lax conditions and the greek government was stupid for wanting to maintain political capital instead of fixing the problem . 
  because the austerity in greece was implemented in tiny increments , instead of applying measures that actually make a difference . 
  just be aware that we have [ anti-tank infantry ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cedlzaw.jpg ), 
  many people are n't made for the military . 
  they simply do n't have what it takes to be a soldier . 
  this is not 100 years ago where strength of numbers decided everything and guerrilla warfare in europe is unlikely . 
  having a professional , well trained , well equipped regular army is a better option than conscription . 
  it ca n't be blocked if it 's budgeted for . 
  romania agreed to spend at least 2 % on defense from 2017 to 2026 .

  romanian pm declared his support in eu parliament , national parliament and spoke with the press about it . 
  i would count that as a `` yes . '', 
  what a garbage website . 
  if you start a `` who 's got it worse '' debate against romania you will lose miserably so do n't go there . 
  it is more reasonable to argue that greeks want to maintain their living standard . 
  not a long time ago someone complained that poles , romanians and bulgarians are ruining britain/germany , etc. 
  yes , it is logical to leave them in a war zone .

  well , if eu would have eyes to notice that bulgaria and hungary already got a number of refugees that surpasses 50x the retarded quota pushed by germany and italy , maybe we would n't have all this crap going on about how eastern europe does n't want to cooperate .

  75 % of minimum wage + 0-10 % of last year 's monthly average . 
  so currently it starts at $ 165 and there 's no upper limit . 
  self-lashing for 70 years does that,

  ( it is very difficult to get an army to fight its own citizens , but it is easy to `` other '' another country 's ) principle of subsidiarity . 
  it 's not the eu 's business to control the citizenry of a state . 
  it might need to be restated more clearly , but it should be obvious . 
  it 's the same in the us , army ca n't act on us soil . 
   who is in charge of this new eu military ? 
  parliament and council vote in chiefs of staff , which are held accountable to committees and the ecj . 
  those chiefs of staff organize things in peace time , and elect a full general in war time . 
  similar to the swiss system . 
  over the years i 've learned that the csu can not be trusted with anything they say . 
  it 's all `` cooperation '' to the public , but they hamstring the process in the background to benefit themselves or their epp allies . 
  i 'm not some stinking turn of the 20th century blood and soil ethno-nationalist . 
  i 'm on the side of the enlightenment founded , social contract , citizen based , right and responsibilities civil-nationalism that created this damn continent from the hands of monarchical empires and judgmental priests . 
  if you believe in democracy , law , personal freedom and security , and you vote in the same polity , as far as i 'm concerned you 're my nation and we 're both working to improve our community and so our lives . 
   europe is not a nation and will never be . 
  there are no european nationalists * waves *, 
  you can vote for anyone , as long as it 's fidesz . 
  france and the netherlands lacking the capability to force project to about the distance of poland is not a good thing . 
  especially since , as you say , it was a pre-prepared war of choice . 
  libya was a mistake , i agree . 
  but we can still learn from how it was carried off . 
  the lesson is we can not muster enough force to actually implement a counter-attack beyond everyone 's respective borders . 
  we can be salami sliced away . 
  there is a significant difference between being strong and choosing not to fight , and being weak and being unable to fight . 
  arguing for the later leaves us at the mercy of others . 
   i agree with you , but tide of history is against us . 
  i see it in my own country when i hear that people would n't support defending poland from russia which is our neighbour and close ally with similar culture . 
  there is no solidarity in europe . 
  there is solidarity in europe . 
  but it 's lost in murky waters . 
  the future might be bleak , but there has to be something just beyond the bleakness . 
  so let 's start now . 
   if the purpose is only defense then nato is sufficient we could n't maintain an armed conflict for a week in libya without asking for help from the us . 
  nato is a paper tiger waiting to be crushed the moment the us looses interest . 
   the people who want an eu army want to use it to bind the union closer together and project power elsewhere . 
  it is an imperialist project . 
  the same arguments as the intermarium . 
  the exact same lesson will be learned . 
  it 's the only way to keep imperialism out of europe . 
   nothing unites the eu establishment as much as imperialist contempt for democracy . 
  it is not democracy to have 27 national leaders go into a secret room and discuss things over champagne . 
  it is not democracy to never have a vote for fear of looking like someone might loose . 
  the parliament has democracy . 
  the eu council at the moment is the meeting of 27 petty kings . 
  we 're not your strawman !, 
  it 's not for you to tell us what we want . 
  stay on your island and watch . 
  and i can only hope to do the same for you . 
  right , because learning from history is a platitude . 
   you think that germans or the french would eagerly support sending their soldiers to die for estonia ? 
  come on . 
  it 's the right thing to do . 
  i do n't care how they feel about it right now , but you ca n't let the vulnerable be bullied and expect the world to work right . 
  it 's a message we say loudly and clearly . 
  it 's not about giving anything up . 
  no one is asking for the national armies to be abolished . 
  that 's not the argument at all . 
  just for a new integrated structure above it . 
  as he says , the swiss system married to the us system . 
  well , that was only a matter of time . 
  no , do n't bother with arguments . 
  just apply godwin 's law on the offending topic until it 's gone . 
  denmark seems to have an anti-eu hardon which the ruling governments have been trying to pander to . 
  just awhile ago they voted against participating in the new eurojust/europol structure , and all the government could do is face palm and move on . 
  they 're still negotiation how to get a technical cooperation deal to still be somewhat involved . 
  but with the swiss , the netherlands and the uk facing the same problem due to voter `` ca n't read the damn question so fuck the eu '' syndrome '' , the eu officials seem a lot less flexible . 
  for detail , the swiss will likely have their anti-free movement referendum again just to make sure that people are fully aware of the shit their brought on themselves . 
  and rutte is trying to crystal ball what the dutch people `` meant '' by voting no to the ukraine treaty , when they themselves admit they just wanted to show they 're just generically not happy .

  we can protect territory by law instead of empty promises . 
   i was refering to cases such as `` you have to accept xxxxxx number of immigrants of which we cant confirm their real identity or face consequences . 
  that was indeed asinine . 
  but it was n't the eu . 
  it was just the council of eu leaders trying to patch up the fact that they 've systematicly failed to get a system in place to handle unified processing , holding and request since it was proposed in 2005 and now could n't make greece be their bloody shield . 
  fuck the national leaders honestly , they 've destroyed this continent and hid behind the eu or whoever they could point fingers at . 
   they can be used by opposition to put pressure on gov without any real danger to democracy of said country . 
  that why multiple organization have to be involved .

  each country where orthodoxy is predominant has its own orthodox church . 
  that 's why you 've heard of the russian orthodox , greek orthodox , romanian orthodox , bulgarian orthodox , serbian orthodox church etc. 
  regarding doctrine , it 's basically identical . 
  it 's also very similar to the catholic doctrine ( the great schism in 1054 and all that ) . 
  they each have their own '' pope '' called a patriarch . 
  another interesting thing is the existence , in romania at least , of the greek catholic church . 
  it 's almost identical to the orthodox one but it 's '' rulled '' by the pope . 
  christian ( mostly orthodox ) . 
  sadly , i ca n't see your flair . 
  i was referring to romania . 
  the majority of romanians support the church so the government is , more or less , obligated to respect the people 's will : to back up the church . 
  and yes , in romania the state is not completely separated from the church . 
  you forgot to mention bribes . 
  there is nothing wrong in supporting those things . 
  the bad thing is that they are doing it just to get votes . 
  after that , they say `` fuck it '' and do whatever they want .

  weird it was ignored . 
  i would n't vote for fidesz . 
  i feel no gratitude for the opportunity to quickly get hungarian citizenship , as it is far outweighed by the fact that since fidesz is in power , hungary 's international prestige has gone down the drain , and its relationship with romania is way more chilly then it used to be . 
  in the mszp days you really felt more warmth in the bilateral relations . 
  so yeah , if i will have citizenship by the time of the elections , i will definitely not vote fidesz . 
  i also think , just for the record , that emigrants should have more voting right than ethnic hungarians from the neighbouring countries ( who might have little contact with hungarian politics ) . 
  also , a lot of people get hungarian citizenship for more pragmatic reasons than `` back in the hungarian family '' yaddy-yadda . 
  many tatars and turks in dobrogea do not appear on the map because : 1 . 
  after dobrogea was awarded to romania ( 1878 ) a significant number of tatars emigrated to turkey 2 . 
  romania pursued a policy of settlement of romanians and aromanians in the region . 
  when we got the region , it was only 1/5 romanian . 
  you can see - in [ the demographic stats ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dobrogea#northern_dobruja ) - a sharp drop in the number of turks and tatars in the 1878-1880 period ( right after it was given to romania ) and a significant rise in romanians in the 1880-1899 period .

  you need an educated elite to start a country an keep it roling . 
  think of the generally high level of education of the european jewish population .

  you ca n't have a country like that without some sense of nationhood , and you ca n't have a sense of nationhood without a minimum level of education . 
  roma are highly dispersed , highly fragmented linguistically ( romany is highly dialectified and many roma speak the language of the host nation ) , highly fragmented into `` cast '' or `` clan '' levels ( traditional kalderash roma do not mary `` lower '' kinds of roma , for example ) and have a weak sense of nationhood ( there is a sense of roma vs non-roma , but far from what we call a `` national consciousness '' ) . 
  creating a country with this population is basically creating a kind of zair or haiti . 
  come on . 
  it 's the most original comment in this whole fuckin thread  ), 
   they may come from romania they come from a lot of eastern european countries . 
  we just have the biggest slice of the pie . 
   try to be constructive about thing that manages to enrage so many people to be fair , there is little constructive criticism in this thread , and a lot of finger-pointing and self-congratulatory prancing around . 
  so are the overwhelming majority of roma in romania . 
  gypsy started out , and it 's still used predominantly as an ethnic name . 
  the fact that it spread to non-roma nomads is true , but it does not negate it 's use as an ethnic exonym . 
   here 's a clip from george carlin about pride oh spare me . 
  this was not about ethnic pride int the `` white pride world wide '' sense . 
  it was about not being ashamed . 
   if i was a roma and wanted to integrate myself with the romanian culture i would n't want to associate myself with the roma culture either . 
  it is widely believed , and for good reasons , that most roma break the law and beg on the streets . 
  now , would n't it be wise to disassociate yourself to this kind of culture in general ? 
  the same way it 's wise to disassociate yourself from being romanian while abroad . 
  you would n't want to be associated with one of the most backward countries in europe , now would you ? 
  do you think shame of `` your randomness '' is logical , btw ? 
   i am fairly certain that the more educated of them do not care about such triviality . 
  i really do n't care how certain you are of things with absolutely zero evidence . 
  not all of them have to be intelectuals , just your average working-class person . 
  the fact remains that there are , according to estimates , somewhere between 1.5 and 2.5 milion romanian citizens are roma . 
  fact remains that only 0.6 milion declare their ethnicity as roma , others choosing to declare something else . 
   i still would n't consider this of them trying to `` pass off as romanian '' but rather to disassociate themselves of being from a mostly toxic culture . 
  the two are not mutually exclusive . 
   it 's due to the vast majority of ` visible ' romanians in western europe being gypsies . 
  same as how the most visible gypsies are the stereotypical ones . 
   til not begging on the street , breaking the law and being an asshole to the general public is trying very hard to pass off as romanian . 
  that 's not what i said . 
  how many of the integrated roma stand proudly by their ethnicity , and how many shy away from mentioning it to the point of saying they are `` romanian '' ? 
  there is a reason twice as many roma ( according to estimates ) declare themselves romanian at the census as there are those who declare themselves roma . 
   there are two ( geographically separated ) groups of roma , one is well integrated and while they keep their identity they do n't cause any problems and the other one lives in tents or villages that look like third world slums could you expand on this a bit please ? 
   probably because most non-gypsy romanians are virtually indistinguishable from italians kinda like non-stereotypical gypsies are virtually indistinguishable from romanians . 
   most romanians have nothing against integrated roma people . 
  to some degree , that 's because integrated roma try very hard to pass off as romanian or , in some cases , hungarian . 
  i think you missreading this . 
  yes . 
  about half of them speak romany ( gypsy ) as their mother tongue , and the other half speak romanian , or to a very small degree , hungarian , as their mother tongue . 
  but either way , the overwhelming majority , if not all of them , understand romanian . 
  * ps * for those interested , [ here ] ( http://www.recensamantromania.ro/rezultate-2/ ) are the census results : ** mother tongue ** : romany - 247.058 out of those with romany as a mother tongue , 244.503 identify as roma , 897 as romanian , 207 as hungarian , and the rest as some other ethnicity . 
  ** ethnicity ** : roma - 621.573 out of those who self-identify as roma , 342.674 consider romanian their mother tongue , 244.503 consider romany their mother tongue , 32.777 hungarian and the rest some other language . 
  i have linked the article featuring the 19 % number in a different comment . 
   but if in those 19 % are most of the thieves , beggars and all around bad people than i think the point stands . 
  this might very well be , but it 's a bit difficult to tell , given that the other type of roma also emigrated to some degree . 
  results : * rate of emigration : 19 % for both roma and non-roma ( households with members in another country ) rate of internal migration : 5 % for roma , 7.7 % for non-roma ( households with members in a different place , but inside romania ) reasons for emigration : ** roma ** * 40.1 % - poverty * 38.3 % - `` for a better life '' * 19.8 % - lack of a job ** non-roma ** * 42.5 % - lack of a job * 39.2 % - `` for a better life '' * 12.4 % - poverty immigrants mostly come from a lower income bracket ( under 700lei/mo . 
  - roughly 157 euro ) , mostly from the cities , neighbourhoods inside the city ( as opposed to the periphery ) and from households with a larger than average number of people . 
  also , 80 % of roma emmigrants come from ethnically mixed neighbourhoods , and only 16.4 % from compact monoethnic roma communities . 
   i 'm partly glad that many of them are not our problem anymore they ( roma from romania ) are still mostly `` our problem '' because : 1 . 
  they are still citizens of our country 2 . 
  most of them are still in romania ( emigration rates are at 19 % for both roma and non-roma ) . 
   we were accused countless times that we were racists and refuse to integrate them in our society , but now the same countries are looking confused at this problem and have no solution for it this issue is a bit more complex than `` if they are to blame it means we are innocent '' . 
  that is indeed , a fair point . 
  i do n't think they are . 
  they are n't saying `` dressing up as women is bad '' . 
  they 're saying `` we 'll dress you up as a woman because it annoys you ( you idiot ) '' . 
   never understood why people try to shame sexist/homophobes ... by dressing them as women . 
  an unfortunate implication there guys . 
  because it annoys the homophobes , by attacking their masculinity ( well , their image of it at least ) . 
  problem is , that would complicate things for russia in a negative way ( from an international pov they would be annexing another states - georgia 's - territory ) . 
  their interest is a nominally independent south ossetia . 
   but it surprises me that there is actually tourism in abchazia . 
  sukhumi ( abkhazia ) , batumi ( georgia ) and sochi ( russia ) were popular tourist destinations in soviet times . 
  i 'm guessing somewhat open borders and the reputation of soviet times brought some of the russians back for a visit . 
  are you gon na do this with every existing country ? 
  you can easily extrapolate my position on kurdish in turkey solely from the information i provided in this thread . 
  i think macedonia 's law is quite ok , but i do n't see how your comment relates to my comment .

  there are several saxon fortresses that are not in cities , e.g.

  any examples of shakespeare 's influence on french literature ? 
  spanish ? 
  italian ? 
  german ? 
   can you provide any kind of argument that ** other ** russian writers influenced in some way the western literature . 
  this discussion began with someone quoting russian literature as * influential * , when they really meant * world class * or something of that sort . 
  you jumped on that ( yes , you 're all over the page with `` asking a simple question '' and what not ) , i gave you * two * names , and * with quotes supporting my statement * ( check the sources on the wikipedia pages ) . 
  now you are in the position to ask `` what * else * did the romans do for us '' , while unable to support your own statements with anything beyond `` everybody knows '' type of arguments . 
  you want more * influential * russian authors ? 
  pasternak ? 
  was gorki an influence on left-leaning literature in the west ? 
  speaking of whom , you may be aware that pete seeger 's [ * where have all the flowers gone * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/where_have_all_the_flowers_gone%3f ) is based on a poem in sholokhov ( while seeger himself is referenced in a book by yevtushenko translated as * sweet land of apples * in romanian ) . 
   and having that story in mind , what we see about shakespeare or homer , is quite another thing : their lyrics ( or those attributed to them ) , their methods are still in use even nowadays . 
  and their influence is literally can indeed be found everywhere you are asking me for quotes when you only provide opinion . 
   we had pretty good relations with russia while it was a tsardom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_bucharest_ ( 1812 ), 
   dostoyevsky https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fyodor_dostoyevsky#reception_and_influence people quoting him as influential include kafka , joyce , virginia woolfe , and nietzsche . 
  here 's from joyce :  he is the man more than any other who has created modern prose , and intensified it to its present-day pitch . 
  it was his explosive power which shattered the victorian novel but do read the wikipedia article . 
  on tolstoy , hemingway [ is quoted ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_and_peace#reception ) to say that he 'd been taking lessons from him on how to :  write about war in the most straightforward , honest , objective and stark way . 
  your argument is sophistic , anyway . 
  one does n't need to `` prove '' that authors like homer or shakespeare were `` influential '' . 
  come to think of it , it 's actually not ugly .

  on the other hand i always thought the magi ( or is it kings ) visited jesus at birth , so i was a bit surprised  eh , i 'm no biblical scholar . 
   it 's the day the three wise men arrived to see jesus that 's western tradition . 
  from your link :  eastern christians , on the other hand , commemorate the baptism of jesus in the jordan river and that explains the * yordan * part ( yordanov = genitive of yordan + den = day , aka * day of jordan * ) . 
  in romainia the same feast is known as * boboteaz\u0103 * ( botez = baptism ) . 
  well , that was a little mean . 
  but we do pay back in ways that are not always obvious . 
  a precondition to joining the eu was privatization of utilities . 
  in bucharest the water services were acquired by veolia through a subsidiary called apa nova . 
  the price of tap water has increased by a factor of 11 since then , and * my * money goes to this eu-based company and its shareholders , not in our roads . 
  but the final point would be that we are a market for eu products ( and i * was * a big nokia fan , back in the day ) . 
  eu money that goes into infrastructure is an investment , as it helps trade and increases revenue for * all * european companies trading here . 
  ultimately you are not paying for other people 's roads . 
  they are european roads , they are * your * roads as well . 
  but it 's paid back in nokia profits on products sold in romania .

  it 's not like ossobuco is popular over here , 
   before that it was an autonomous principality that was annexed by the russian empire nope . 
  the russian empire annexed the eastern half of the moldavian principality , which continued to exist in the remaining territory . 
  the moldavian principality united in 1859 with the southern principality of wallachia to form romania . 
  the eastern half got its independence from the nascent ussr and united with romania in 1918 . 
  in reply the ussr formed a moldavian republic in territories currently known as transnistria , to which it annexed the eastern half of moldavia in 1945 . 
   turkic peoples are not mongols , and your link does n't imply that they are . 
  it was just a paragraph , dude .

  these elites ** adopted turkic languages ** and different religions such as buddhism and islam , while ** retaining mongol ** political and legal institutions no , turkic peoples are ** not ** mongols .

  i actually have an aunt from bihor ( which was never 100 % hungarian , you know ) that remembers 1940 , never talks about it but hungarians are not a suitable subject at family dinners . 
   the reason that diplomats do n't go to celebrate this is not simply that it would celebrate a loss of territory . 
  hungarian diplomats never had a problem with december 1st until today . 
  what is special about 2016 ? 
  what , in your opinion , would be a reasonable response from romania for 1940 ? 
  in my view , as stated above , both sides should act like grown-ups . 
  bygones are bygones , what matters is the present , and above it , the future .

  we 've had nokia try to set up a factory in cluj what must be a decade ago . 
  in three years it went from `` we 're bringing it thousands to jobs '' to `` we 're closing down shop and leaving 2.200 unemployed '' . 
  skepticism is the right attitude to have with these `` hard and fast '' corporate systems . 
  they tell you what you need to hear , when you need to hear it , and do what they want when they want it . 
  right now , they might be trying to prevent talent leaking outside the company while they 're poaching off the necessary tools , people and intellectual property . 
  who knows how the situation is going to look like for gorhmann in a few years time , but i suspect some sort of restructuring towards their `` center of operation '' in the states . 
  packaging brussels , soros and immigration together into a neat little conspiracy . 
  i 'm impressed how they 're weaving this . 
  not impressed by how blunt it is , but it 's propaganda not an oscar film . 
  edit : i wonder if the epp politicians that let orban off the hook yesterday feel like idiots yet ... or they 're just numb to the feeling by now . 
  to be fair , their attempts to climb out of that r&d hole in the form of the n9 was aborted in favor of a quick corporate coup and pay out . 
  i only became aware of the conditions there during their `` winding down '' , when people 's purpose and jobs were under a constant question mark . 
  did n't know that their mistreatment of subcontractors had a deeper history . 
  where are you from ? 
  germans flying german flags outside of a sport event ? 
  wow . 
  either way , that sort of shrill nationalism does n't really fly well . 
  i mean , we 're speaking english ( a foreign language as far as i 'm concerned ) on an international board , we 're past that . 
  what matters is getting the investment , contracts and technology transfers going . 
  in the 90 's ? 
  everywhere . 
  because of trade barriers and lack of investment western companies had big advantages and could use local employment numbers in the west to have their governments manage better conditions for them . 
  only when we joined the eu did we start seeing stable acquisitions and more extensive contracting . 
  but we 're still far away from regrowing the necessary mittelstand necessary to work outside the political pressures of the west , like when big companies outright move factories forcing western governments to act like we saw recently in france . 
  and to do that we 'll require a lot of legislative and financial intervention to allow `` start-ups '' to appear without people selling them off again . 
  considering we 're also seeing chinese companies practicing the same thing that musk is doing , i 'm very critical of the concept of `` owner is king '' . 
  to prevent what happened in ee to happen in the rest of europe , a more hands-on approach to industrial development is needed as we 've seen with the very successful airbus and arianespace models . 
  no , what happened in ee was the companies got bought off by competitors , dismantled , equipment sold or moved , and the workers laid off allowing their buyers to sell foreign-made products in the market at higher prices based from the already heavily industrialized and modernized western regions . 
  the workers had to accept unemployment or to move to the west to get their jobs back as a result . 
  so what i 'm saying comes with a gram of personal experience in how `` i own it and so have full control '' works in real life . 
  i 'm not so , to better understand , it 's fallen for the `` technology will save us '' cult , with the added corporate fanboyism that goes with it ? 
  that 's kind of disappointing . 
  i do n't think so . 
  i do n't think that 's the kind of place anybody here wants to live in . 
  whatever you do , whatever you own , everyone has a final responsibility to society . 
  it might be their property , but if society sees destructive behavior happening it can and has the moral responsibility to at least comment if not outright intervene . 
  we 've seen what happened in nokia , why allow it to happen anywhere else ? 
  i do n't think you realize that this is pretty much a death sentence to grohmann . 
  you do n't recover in industry from this , industrial clients are n't as fickle as consumers , they need to deal with the same people for a decade or more , so they need stability . 
  from this point on , grohmann 's only future is either to be completely subsumed into tesla and operations torn apart or fail if tesla fails . 
  either way , it 's one company that no longer exists . 
  germany is the manufacturing engine of europe for a reason . 
  shit like this is n't done , it 's monopolistic behaviour that works against the mittelstand . 
  it 's always strange than when europeans discuss this , they compare the idea to the usa , rather than the nearby multi-cultural , multi-lingual federation switzerland . 
  i mean , i get it . 
  switzerland works without turning into a centralized homogeneous blob and has managed to defend itself and it 's neutrality through ww2 . 
  it undermines a lot of arguments by simply existing , but that does n't mean that people should get away with ignoring it . 
  or northern england when you think about it . 
  the whole `` economic recovery '' angle has turned out to be `` london is doing better , plebs rejoice '' , considering how austerity is still being implemented . 
  we ca n't actually keep it secret . 
  if we try , there will be a news leak in a day with `` secret eu plan to annex northern ireland '' stamped on the headline . 
  transparency is the best policy considering . 
  and considering they have n't had a problem since the good friday agreement , which still stand , why whine about it now ? 
  because they ca n't boogeyman the eu like in scotland or something ? 
  this is honestly between the uk and irish government , the eu is simply not standing in the way . 
  they all are the ones most interested in keeping the status quo , or as close as possible . 
  surprisingly enough , they are acting as if the eu does indeed recognize the possibility of `` scabs '' . 
  you 'd think the political naivete we keep showing would n't allow for that , but apparently there is a sense that we do n't want to loose to a divide and conquer tactic . 
  you 're mistaking this for a top-down union , which it has never been . 
  the `` planning '' is actually extended negotiation and compromise from it 's members being delivered haphazardly . 
  members are making preparation for brexit , and since it 's pointless to hide anything in the eu apparatus to begin with , you 're all getting a play by play update of the results . 
  yesterday , metaphorically , some country or other made a grab for the ema , the day before spain managed to get itself a mention on gibraltar . 
  and today ireland got a unification guarantee . 
  these things will happen , and the day that you find out is likely the day it was agreed on , not some tactical ploy . 
  edit : the fact your media spins it otherwise is , honestly , another matter . 
  then they are taking things far too personally , which is unprofessional . 
  like i said , this has always been the position of ireland . 
  in many ways nothing has changed . 
  you are taking things far too personally . 
  the eu is supposed to represent the interests of its member states . 
  since ireland has expressed openly a position of pro-reunification , for the better part of a century in fact , lacking any other counter-interest from another member , that has become the position of the eu . 
  this is n't a directed attack of any sort , merely the logical rebalancing of eu geopolitical considerations as part of it 's changed make-up . 
  we dont ** need ** a civil war . 
  it 's just a natural result of the conflicts between decentralists and centralists . 
  pl commonwealth and kingdom of hungary had simillar with the minor nobility . 
  it 's just a pattern . 
  we dont ** need ** a civil war . 
  it 's just a natural result of the conflicts between decentralists and centralists . 
  pl commonwealth and kingdom of hungary had simillar with the minor nobility . 
  it 's just a pattern . 
  the us and switzerland struggled with integration and both had to fight a civil war . 
  germany and italy did n't but had tremendous international pressure , and still have issues with it to this day . 
  it looks like it 's a natural part of how states are formed . 
  simicska offered a lot of money and the current owner wants to buy a house in vienna and not deal with this any more ? 
  i do n't think you realize how much they were willing to give and how much criticism they received for it . 
  cameron was really pushing the line . 
   you mean montenegro , and it 's not all clear about that incident , in any case it 's fishy . 
  yeah , mistake on my part . 
   and they 're backing the serbia-kosovo dispute literally as much as spain , greece or romania do since they do n't recognize kosovo either . 
  the amount of military cooperation suggest a closed and coordinated relationship . 
  and with the new administration , pro-russian support and anti-kosovar stunts have grown in proportion . 
   also , i 'm more or less thinking about some desperate east european here that is scared about the eu falling apart because it would mean there is nobody to pay for their roads in their corrupt countries . 
  every comment chain with a dutch poster ends with this . 
  y' all just seem to enjoy lording it over people . 
  your companies buy our land , you keep us out of schengen , and you sabotage eu anti-corruption fights , but that 's not enough . 
  you need to remind us that you spent the last 50 years between the 3 big economies in europe and enjoyed it . 
  is this a cultural trait ? 
  do you go to your poorer neighbors and remind them you paid for the road in front ? 
  then why do his ministers come out during the meetings stalling procedure and complaining that no more needs to be done ? 
  why did the dutch presidency turn out to be the presidency of `` let 's try to set a record for the least amount of legislative work in eu history '' ?

  it 's horrible and i 'll remember it all my life !, 
  maybe i should 've been more careful about my words . 
  arguably , their thing will spit blood instead ... 
  oh , so i 'm sexist now !? 
  so be it , i love good looking men and i like having sex with them . 
  i do n't like to be an object , i do n't like to see girls like me used like sexual objects , i would love to see one of you guys beefing up under seven women tho !, 
  i 'm not sexist and i do n't insult anyone without reason , she was raped and your kind of person laughed !, 
  looks like you love your pants then , my grandma was right . 
  how lazy you are , simply say it !, 
  mate , she was raped !, 
  for a woman this is worse than death . 
  i 'm sorry if i somehow managed to offend you . 
  i did that many times . 
  you are a woman ? 
  as a woman , did you had sex ? 
  okay , if you say so . 
  what 's stylish there ? 
  do n't tell you have a beard too !, 
  it might mean that your pants look awful or that you love to talk about the glorious bhla bhla until the morning ... 
  i 'm 18 !, 
  what if two stupid guys , let 's say my brothers , will fk you in your behind ? 
  would you feel it the next day ? 
  edit : thanks for downvote , but if you would 've lived what i lived , you would be much more harsh , believe me !, 
  always ... away from polish pants , my grandma last words ;p, 
  are you a woman yourself ? 
  i get it , they want to be married and stay home , cuz that 's what they learn at home !, 
  we like to show up too , just like you guys and we love to have sex just like you guys and we have feelings just like you guys !!!!, 
  nah , we have our own coal . 
  for the moment : /, 
  if you have a yt account and you seem to know both languages , why do n't you do that ? 
  translate those videos for us . 
  and he 's the one and only mr. mk vg !!!, 
  of course we 'll cut the tired cos it 's bad for the public and for our purpose , 
  what ? 
  it does n't matter how much they are , it 's still seven guys !, 
  well , you do n't right now but . . , i 'm sorry guys but nobody can do anything for you . 
  your way of thinking about human rights and women it 's preposterous , not to mention that your organization inspired the ones like obl and isis . 
  you realize that i 'm a woman , i hope !, 
  you live in poland , lots mine 's there , try it !, 
  black is better , brown is wood and your teeth will probably suffer :d, 
  i love the taste , no digestive issues for me when i was ten . 
  just try it , you know you want it  nah , i do n't do that anymore ... : '' ( edit : and is miss , ya idiot ; p, 
  i do n't quite understand , i 'm sorry , please be more specific !, 
  muslim brotherhood is a terrorist organization , i do n't think your actual govt is alright but it 's better than them !, 
  turkey has from time to time coups \u00e9tat only to keep the secular ( normality ) going . 
  i 'm not a man you ... 
  catholic !!, 
  : ) it 's quite tasty , if it has the right texture lolololol im salivating now : ^ ), 
  why ? 
  i really liked coal , if it 's not too wood like . 
  my mom was amazed by those black things on my teeth . . until i told her two years ago hahaha, 
  why did n't we knew about this ?!, 
  was it on cnn or france24 ? 
  would n't they be smarter than that and bury his corpse in some remote area instead of ... this ? 
  but i ca n't wait to see you governor in illinois ; ), 
  it is about a rape , you idiots !!!, 
  stop with those fucking stupid jokes !, 
  what 's wrong with you guys ??? 
  you have no feelings , no compassion ? 
  of course , this should be the answer for someone far away from his country ... attack the local police . 
  why not those idiots who teach them try that themselves , but not to the police , they should try it with gendarmes . 
  that must be it !!!, 
  she felt something 's wrong with her body , it 's impossible not to , and she assumed that she had sex with someone but because of the intoxication ca n't remember who !, 
  maybe she thought it was some extraordinary gifted man or something . 
  i mean , seven for god sake ... poor girl , i 'm only one and a half years older than her . 
  thanks , you too !, 
  and do n't forget , anytime you need a shot of strong moonshine give me a sign ; ) cheers !, 
  how , in the name of everything is holy , she did n't felt anything after she woke up ?!, 
  i 'm a woman myself and after . . well , a night with a man i have some physical signals ... she did n't feel nothing wrong after seven guys !, 
  this is ... 
  i really have no words !!!, 
  fkin criminals !!!, 
  i wish i 'd be face-to-face with one of them and stick a knife in its head !, 
  edit : yeah , now that i have a cooler head than when i wrote the initial comment i 'll only stab them in the heart !, 
  i 'm only 18 and a half myself and i automatically identified with that girl , sweat like a pig instantly when i read this ( i was in a bad situation myself , fortunately my brothers were close by and i was sober , and with only two guys not seven ! ) . 
  downvote away , but i wo n't change my statement !, 
  but i like the orange ' skin ' , in fact not sure if oranges ( those small ones with thin skin ) , i eat it all after i finish the fruit . 
  but i ate coal in my childhood so . . : ^ ), 
  sorry for the very late answer , i 've been quite busy and i would n't be ` verylateish ' if i 'll answer on time  no , i did n't thought about that , i 'm still too young to make such plans and my relationship with my boyfriend is ... well , pretty open since the distance between us is quite big and both of us love to live in our own native places lol . 
  i like what me dad do !, 
  and i love , some irish guy, 
  how do you think we fought on wien or why ? 
  yeah right !, 
  we 'll go down like our parents !, 
  you 're a lawyer or not ? 
  political life is the next step !, 
  only where i live and in some places in the east . 
  more in the south !, 
  i 'm still on high school . 
  but i can bet i 'll be in political landscape before you ; ), 
  i want that and i 'll be that !, 
  you are ? 
  i guess is similar with what our pastor said !, 
  you get some downvotes just like me , so stay away , 
  i have highschool exam this year , but i 'll book my political life !, 
  i 'll be a lawyer no matter what !, 
  you must be dry again !, 
  i choosed a neutral place . 
  come here and you 'll have enough . 
  nobody will let you leave without drinking at least a glass , no matter if winter or summer !,

  do n't worry romani is the plurar for `` romanian '' in romanian and the plurar of `` roman '' in latin , do n't let the pc word for gypsies make you feel bad . 
  nothing , something about macron and prince . 
  these people are usually unemployed or students that do n't have anything to do in their free time so they prefer going to protest for the lols, 
  paid by soros, 
  well better than being known as gypsies i guess, 
  russia has almost the same gdp per capita as romania lol, 
  most think we are the land of gypsies , implying that gypsies could rule a country lol, 
  it 's ok , they are preparing for what it is to come , in 200 years romania will be a gypsy majority state anyway unless holocaust v2 happens . 
  rasnov citadel is one of the best things to see in transylvania, 
  if you are wondering why there are no gypsies in this picture is because gypsies do n't go to school . 
  stereotypes are for butthurt hungarians that is the reason . 
  i confirm, 
  romani is a political correct bullshit word like 20 years old which to many of us seems more like a conspiracy to merge romanians and gypsies in one , but whatever , here in romania gypsies call themselves tigani ( just like gypsies , gitanos , \u03c4\u03c3\u03b9\u03b3\u03b3\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 , cigani in other languages ) and they do n't consider themselves romanians ( unless they need to leave for w.europe ) so we are fine , it 's just western europe needs to learn the difference . 
  i have an albanian friend and he told me a lot of stuff . 
  you ca n't even compare our communism with your communism . 
  sadly for the albanians , it was much , much worse . 
  the only thing we inherited from the romans is our language and our name because of it . 
   when we think of albania we think of povery , crime , islam etc. 
  ironic because that 's what all europe thinks about us , but instead of islam add gypsies . 
  when people claim romania 's communist regime was the worst remind them of albania and their isolation , romanians could even watch american series on tv lol, 
  well this map only shows one thing , the top ranked . . 
  all countries of the eastern block are the same, 
  it 's our gold fuck off, 
  i rather live with -20 honestly than with 30 and 40 , here in romania we have both -20 and 40 and i know how it feels , i hate summer more than anything , trust me , you are just fine up there !, 
  i am moving to finland you guys are so lucky anything above 25 is hell for me . 
  condolences, 
  no thnx, 
   help me god almighty and vladimir putin lol, 
  mostly everyone hates it but you ca n't do anything about it there will always be people that like this music , it 's like the typical balkan party music of our days you can hear the same type of songs in serbia , greece , bulgaria and at us but a lot of romanians hate it because they consider it degenerate gypsy music since mostly gypsies sing it here unlike the other listed countries . 
  it 's romanian turbofolk but as is tradition in our lands , gypsies sing the music , some say it is the only legal thing gypsies can do right , but i still dont like this degenerate music . 
  there is a simple solution , go out there and put trucks carrying logs on fire , in this country , logging is one of the biggest businesses of the boyars , it wo n't stop legally . 
  yes they doing something , logging . 
  shit happens when bolshevism wins . 
  even better , it really is n't and you should also remove wallachia i think . 
  i am just thinking of the future , they reproduce faster than us so i do n't want in the future some gypsies to become like kurds to want their own state within our state , if they assimilate and become romanians before they become too many and romanians feel that our national security is threatened then everything will be alright . 
  same thing i would like for szekelys and hungarians in the west but they are not a threat because they reproduce as much as us so ... but just know this shall they ever reach 20 % of our popoulation or higher things wo n't be good here and i am trying to fix this , there are many romanians that would agree with death camps for them so i believe my solution is the best , you do n't know how much people hate them here , because of what they do , their isolation , they shame us in the west , gypsi is one of the worst insults here , it 's like saying , subhuman . 
  on the other side they never fought for anything and most of the times they fight eachother but there will still be chaos if they grow too much in population , i am trying to find the best and most peaceful solution and that is assimilation and integration . 
  maybe they should integrate in the countries they live in since many of them are citizens of a specific country already ? 
  that would solve the problem here too . 
  if they are from romania they should use the romanian flar , after all , they claim they are romanians when they go in western europe . 
  transylvania will become transylvania ( romania ) and szekler and roma will be removed , fucking perfect ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  well at least there is some historical background for this specific kind of statue at this location , it makes more sense now thanks . 
  hungary has amazing history with important kings n sheit , you make a 12,5 m statue and it is this ? 
  i was talking more about poland and romania in this case but it does n't change anything because russia cries a lot about these too , if the finnish government wants to conduct drills with the us army then i do n't understand what 's their fucking problem . 
  ignore him many romanians on reddit are very triggered by religion because our church leader is corrupt so they are too blind to see that christianity is one of the things on which european civilization was built upon and too ignorant to know and accept it . 
  at least , they represent only a small percentage of our population so everything is good . 
  i am also an orthodox and i love monarchy , i do n't want to force anyone to believe or have a good thought of monarchy but it 's funny seeing stuff like this from time to time , the average romanian wants the politicians to be impaled infront of the parliament by vlad tepes but at the same time hate authoritarian governments because of people like ceausescu so we are a strange kind of people so yeah , peace be with you greek brother !, 
  russia can be present and kill people in syria because they are invited by the syrian government , but us ca n't be present and take part in military drills with other nato nations even if invited by the other nato nations because it 's too close to the russian borders . 
  typical rtard logic . 
  that was a huge drop :(, 
  it was not their fault mang if alexius iv never went to zara nothing would happen , seriously now thinking of it considering the impact the sacking of constantinople by the crusaders had on the future of the byzantine empire if someone was to time travel back in time and stop him the whole history would be changed . 
  n sheit, 
  fucking noobs serbs refused to make the argonath real life wtf is wrong with you ? 
  wuz, 
  i wish ceausescu turned romania to north korea . 
  we would have nukes and shit . 
  damn , sadly we are way too high . 
  the imperealist americans did it, 
  the only water i buy is sparkling water, 
  this forest and mountain bullshit is retarded imo , nobody lives in caves and forests for 1000 years . 
  vlachs were always in the area , all over balkan and they were blending with other tribes and populations only till basarab i managed to unite all the vlachs and form wallachia . 
  this makes much more sense , the hungarian version of vlach history makes even more sense but everything dies when vlachs are mentioned as early as 6th century in the area . 
  moldova rightful hungarian land, 
  i understand him , after all , turkey has a great leader that cares for his people just like orban . 
  thank god we are not blue, 
  it 's beautiful, 
  this is kinda gay but whatever, 
  everytime someone posts anything that is considered beautiful in romania , it 's something that was built by ceausescu . 
  it 's imposible to post something beautiful from romania that is not from the time of ceausescu because nothing was built after 1989 . 
  ceausescu said no to the ussr multiple times , he broke relations several times , ussr was mad , after he fell down , kgb related , ussr affiliated fools take over what more sense does it need to make ? 
  that cross is very racist and islamophobic eu should sanction romania !, 
  here everyone is pro-europe , there are very few pro-russian people . 
  the fact that eu pushes shit like gay marriage and more stuff which many romanians do not agree wo n't change anything , when you have your fathers and grandfathers tell you how russians fucked them in the ass , then fucked the cows , then the chickens , things like gays and globalism do n't matter anymore . 
  yes thank god we have freedom and democracy . 
  who needs factories , production , less homeless people , infrastructure , law and order , less crime and zero unemployment when you have freedom after all ? 
  coup d'etat set up by ussr, 
  wait wtf i love merkel now, 
  calm down sven . 
  i think you are very racist and gypsophobic . 
  gypsies are very intelligent and hard working people . 
  and because we love you swedish people so much we allow you to take this wonderful minority and host them in your country so they can contribute to your society !, 
  we are very sad that our gypsies are leaving but that 's how it is ... :( (, 
  we stopped it a bit in the 40s, 
  calin al-romani, 
  soon romania should be red too, 
  this is even better than transfagarasan, 
  it 's so fucking hot, 
  this is kinda ... gay ... 
  if it was n't for ceausescu this road would n't exist today lol, 
  climate change is not real edit : lol fags stop downvoting i was just trying to trigger you, 
  and good pussy, 
  thanks i was too bored to pick it up . 
  if russia will take us over you will need to help us or else you will run out of wood supply kek, 
  psd is the best party in romania traitor grindeanu will be taken down, 
  romania would benefit from economic relations with russia , what is so scary lol, 
  because there are many russians in moldova that do n't want that ( seed planted by stalin after he deported the real moldovans ) . 
  and if moldova and romania would try to unite , rebels would appear controlled from hqs in transnistria and russia would support them to protect russian minorities just like they did in ukraine . 
  it 's not simple to try to join eu and nato when you have a russian minority . 
  here is your answer . 
  it 's similar because both are the creation of communist propaganda for decades that brainwashed people into thinking they are a different nation that other people that share the same language and religion and culture .

  bigger cities should present more and more opportunities and change will come . 
  if you move back , you will bring change as well . 
  this is sorta off-topic but i love what you wrote . 
  i am not sure if you are spanish but overall i found that spanish people are one of the most welcoming people in europe , statistically on par with northern europe but on a personal level they are warmer and kinder . 
  it is this reason why after long considerations with my wife , spain is the only option in europe that we can consider moving to besides portugal . 
  and we are financially independent with a young kid and would open a business there ... now with that autonomo thing and burreaucracy and corruption ... well , that makes it not ideal . 
  but the people and the open mentality , acceptance for lgbt and immigrants make up for that . 
  yes , and i always wonder what they are working ... they could stream their life online and i would pay to see it . 
  0 votes in north korea !, 
  last time at the presidential elections it was 3 votes for johannis and 2 votes for ponta !, 
  in my circle it is closer to 20 % - 25 % of the people are lgbt and that is in romania . 
  lots of closeted lgbt who will tell you they are lgbt as you are tolerant and supportive and participate at the pride but wo n't tell their parents . 
  but overall the 5 % is accepted , slightly lower for lesbians . 
  there is still hope for the independent to be profitable as there are still european wannabe leaders who will buy ads !, 
  sure , move , but the problem with europe as a whole is the language barrier . 
  with english only you could find a job in the uk , ireland or malta and if your qualification is in demand in most bigger cities ( berlin , paris , frankfurt , amsterdam ) but even then it would be a big plus to speak the local language . 
  you have less mobility around the eu because of language barriers , so let 's say once you choose to move to germany and learn german you would have a harder time to move again to france or denmark for example . 
  if you do not depend on a job though ... that is completely different and the world is yours, 
  i agree with that . 
  agree about county borders . 
  partially agree about the regions . 
  it is a big debate in oradea as well as many would prefer a crisana region . 
  i agree with that from your perspective . 
  harcov has more in common with mures than with other regions . 
  on another hand if there would be only 8 regions , then szekely region would not be feasible just like crisana region would n't be feasible either because of the population issue . 
  these regional governments would get separate funding with another layer of bureaucracy etc. 
  anyway , that is a long and off-topic discussion and i think there are both pros and cons to it . 
  philosophically i agree with self-determination too . 
  from a practical pov i suspect a more autonomous szekely region would create issues as well . 
  i do n't want to deviate too much but it would be very handy to manipulate a small autonomous region with a few millions in propaganda etc in order to create chaos . 
  a divided europe ( implicitly romania ) would be handy and i am not sure it would be in anyone 's advantage . 
  however ideally i support that , in the current climate and with a more emotional approach rather than pragmatic , i do not support it .

  she is four months old and she loves nothing more than being kissed on her cheeks !, 
  she will give you an instasmile in return !, 
  lobbying was done by udmr and sometimes public investments were routed there , at least more often than in other areas like mehedinti or ialomita . 
  also , if you look at the [ road quality map ] ( http://imgur.com/yzciixa ) , the situation is not the worst there although not good either . 
  companies look for scalability as well . 
  there is a limit to how many people you can employ in a 50k city . 
  it investments will go in large urban areas with good universities . 
  auto investments will go in larger urban areas . 
  as an example in oradea there is faist mekatronic . 
  they currently employ around 1,600 people i think but if they could they would hire another 1,000 easily ( they even want to build apartments near their factory so that people from further away in the county can come and work for them and leave on weekends only ) . 
  you do n't find that many people in small cities . 
  however a lot more could have been done and could be done in harcov but udmr needed to ride the autonomy wave otherwise they would have lost votes to the other hungarian parties . 
  i know directly from source that not everybody was happy with the way their rhetoric needed to change ( while udmr is right wing , there are all types of people in there , some of them being quite liberal ) . 
  he says the things many disillusioned people want to hear ; that they are special snowflakes who did no bad and history was bad against their great country which btw is the purest in all . 
  using lots of adjectives and no substance he can appeal the emotional side . 
  [ bonus to lighten the mood up ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lec7mzyaagw ), 
  you live close by though !, 
  drop me a note if you ever come to oradea to have a coffee, 
  i had to go when i wrote that too . 
  what i wanted to say is that harcov is less developed economically but it has more to do with geography and demographics than politics . 
  sure , if we take into account the politics of the 80 's i will fully agree that there was political will to keep the region underdeveloped ( no big industry was moved there ) and i am sure you will find the loonies who would want to keep it that way but i feel they are in minority . 
  politics-wise too it is not wise to invest there as you will not sway voters towards your party ( [ see this video maybe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rstl7nir7gs ) ) as they will vote mostly ethnically and in terms of political gains it is not a good investment ( unfortunately this is how things work ) . 
  but harcov would have issues anyway because they are small counties with no big city that could attract talent the way cluj , timisoara or even iasi can do . 
  bigger urban aglomerations attract talent and talent attracts investment . 
  if you look at maps ( whether you look at foreign direct investments per capita or gdp per capita or almost any metric ) you will see counties with larger urban areas like cluj or timis doing fairly better than the rest . 
  on the other hand counties with small cities are doing worse , even in transylvania ( see salaj or bistrita ) and in the case of bistrita it is clear that it has nothing to do with it being ethnically hungarian . 
  mures gets more private and public investments because it has a larger urban area and it is wiser to invest there where more people live . 
  i suspect that even if harcov would be ethnically purely romanian it would still not be ( much ) different economically ( i put much in brackets because of the way votes could be moved and some purely electoral public investments might have been made there but overall not much impact ) . 
  looking at mures or bihor counties , you will get a different picture . 
  they are well-off compared to romanian standards and they get public investments . 
  craiova alone as a city has a larger population than covasna county and as a transylvanian i say that not enough public investment flows there ( considering there is a ford factory there too ) . 
  there is this lie repeated over time that transylvanian counties contribute more to the state budget vs what they receive . 
  while certainly there are plenty of regions that get more from the state budget and they are not in transylvania , however i look at the statistics i do not see discrimination . 
  take a look at [ this article ] ( http://www.gandul.info/financiar/exclusiv-gandul-harta-banilor-din-romania-pe-judete-vezi-aici-cat-primeste-inapoi-judetul-tau-din-impozitele-platite-statului-8549493 ) or at [ this one ] ( http://www.economica.net/harta-judetelor_80453.html ) you might say salaries are lower in harcov and you are right . 
  but that is how things are in smaller cities where lots of small and medium sized businesses operate - the minimum wage is paid officially , the rest is paid in hand . 
  in bigger cities with multinationals , things are more clear . 
  in vaslui salaries are higher officially because lots of state employees ( their salary is white ) and more unemployment on the other hand . 
  but that is another issue completely . 
  feel free to pm me if you want to chat . 
  oh , dan puric is big , unfortunately . 
  hundreds of people pay money to hear his nonsensical monologues in every city and town in romania ... ramblings about nationalism etc. 
  he is a bestselling author as well ( i want to puke thinking about that ) . 
  ah , no , but there are lighter versions of them like dan puric who have great appeal to the greater public . 
  oh and the dacopats . 
  i find it odd that people remember maps from 100 years ago but that is nothing compared to the dacopats ( i think you have at least romanian ancestry so that is why i will not go deeper into that ) . 
  lots of conspiratards who are bringing up the glorious dacian borders ( wtf ) and how they were invaded by all these migrants ( hurr durr ) . 
  you might consider them loonies ( they certainly are ) but the revival of the dac myth is so silly ... 
  i have no words ... in fact many consider jesus was from dacia . 
  do n't believe me ? 
  this has nothing to do with hungary but lots of people are uneducated and they do n't believe you when you tell them oradea ( my city ) has not been part of romania ... 
  i met people who would argue ( based on what ) that it was a dac city and it is part of romania then ... you ca n't go any lower than that with interpreting history . 
  i agree . 
  except slovakian drivers . 
  i was almost run over twice in budapest - twice slovakian license plates ( might have been tax-dodging hungarians though ) . 
  less so myself but i heard plenty of times variations of `` they are in romania , they should please the majority '' or `` why do n't they speak our language ? '', 
  last time coming from a teenager towards an obvious group of hungarian tourists ... he did not take it lightly when i told to shut up his whore mouth as his family barely moved back from working in a country where they did not speak the local language - but ok , he was a stupid teenager . 
  recently there was [ a case that got the media 's attention ] ( http://www.mediafax.ro/social/plangere-la-cncd-depusa-de-udmr-in-cazul-unui-medic-care-ar-fi-umilit-o-fata-din-covasna-15081657 ) but i am 100 % sure plenty of other similar cases exist ( hell , my mother can tell some ) . 
  oh , i know the whole region is a clusterfuck historically . 
  that is why it is futile to look for `` right and wrong '' . 
  there is absolutely no side who did not commit atrocities ( look at romanian army in odessa ) and there is no good and bad , just politics that played out the way it did . 
  and by the way of that , this november there were 75 years from the odessa masacre ( where 25.000 people were killed during three days ) . 
  i did not see any tv show commemorating it . 
  same for hungary . 
  there are many positive things to be said about them too , but then i pass through kenderes every time i go to budapest and there the horthy museum is advertised ... no shame in either country 's history , no guilt , no honesty when talking about history ( this thing is valid for the whole region , not just ro and hu ) . 
  there would be nothing to lose and a lot to gain if people would learn that in their history , their country committed atrocities , blind love for a nation leads to no good . 
  `` there is the sign 200 meters on your back , you are romanian , you ca n't read '' . 
  however , plenty of similar experiences for hungarians in romania .

  people care about many things and they do n't think that a union will do much to solve their problems .

  and when you know they 'll essentially get a slap on the wrist ? 
  it would n't to me . 
  feel free to call me edgy , barbaric , uncivilized , whatever buzzword you can throw at me , but i 'd do life sentence for my child . 
  a father whose daughter was raped and/or killed . 
  calm down there stud . 
  not much of what 's been happening in sweden has been logical . 
  i must 've missed the part where other minorities in europe had aristocracies and parliamental rights where they could veto policies and reforms . 
  it does , but it evolved past it and it stopped being `` roman '' and became `` romanian '' . 
  romania does n't mean land of the romans , it means land of romanians , or land of all romanians . 
  theres a difference between roman and rom\u00e2n , but it does n't translate in english . 
  oltenia/banate of severin had a lion on their coa for a long time because they 're special snowflakes .

  `` muh war criminals '' great whataboutism dipshit , your terrorist government has done worse , but it 's okay because you hide behind the shield of holocaust and homosexality , which washes all sins .

  no , i 'm annoyed by insipid tabloids that think that 1 . 
  europe is a singular entity and 2 .

  and this might just be caligula to some future nero . 
  airbus is actually loosing money off the a400 . 
  it partially blames having to rely on a political-promoted contractor europrop international , and the ceo has publicly stated he 's reluctant from every engaging in such a project again . 
  the esa/arianespace is actually moving away from the system of negotiations surrounding multi-national projects because of the failures it caused in such project as typhon/a400/iter . 
  the eu itself actually nationalized the galileo projects for similar reasons . 
  we 're getting better at doing such projects every year , as we 're learning ( very painfully ) what works , and abandoning `` feel good '' strategies around cross-national negotiations . 
  there is no natural comparative advantage in the high tech in industry . 
  any advantage that exists , exists as a result of years of investment , experience and development . 
  first , it 's incredible that now that china has made a point of expanding in every single manufacturing market , as well as as having spent decades building up it 's portfolio to the point it 's nearing the naval and aeroscape ability of the west , that westerners are so keen to do the exact opposite . 
  second , it 's incredible that this idea of `` comparative advantage '' in industrialized economies still exists when a hundred years ago friedrich list looked over it , threw it in the trash and wrote the economic premises that allowed the development of prussian , american , japanese/korean/taiwanese , and now chinese industrial might . 
  and no , the political aspect is not negligible . 
  the line between ally and vassal is the ability to choose . 
  by putting our defense industry in their hands , we sell of that choice . 
  it would be much easier if we got rid of `` juste retour '' mentality in development , and just allowed european companies to compete without being treated as national treasures to be backed . 
  the issue with both the eurofighter and a400m has been a bad tendency to put such thinking before a common position , and the result has been failure and more orders/jobs eventually leaking to the americans . 
  strategic infrastructure is also a thing , as are monopolies . 
  let 's not be the naive here , and put ourselves in the hands of arms merchants especially when it comes to highly niche equipment . 
  and especially one 's with their own geostrategic interests they want others to follow . 
  and a country can produce every single technology across the board , there is no technical reason why not . 
  the issue has always been leveraging order numbers to take advantage of mass production to lower costs . 
  which for 50 years european countries have had a hard time doing alone , but which we are perfectly able to do together . 
  now let 's be sensible , not lease our own security from unscrupulous hegemony from an ocean away and actually do the work necessary to give ourselves a measure of self-reliance and geopolitical independence . 
  it 's never too late to start developing your own equipment . 
  the generational moniker is simply a haphazard convention of aircraft classification , not some clear line of development . 
  if we start now , the pundits might call it generation 5.1 or generation 6th , but it would still be the plane that does the job with the technology we currently have . 
  either way , we need to do it soon because you ca n't restart a niche aerospace sector from scratch once it 's gone . 
  you do know it 's possible to forget how to build something right ? 
  all it takes is one generation of engineers to retire before the next project . 
  we keep buying our equipment instead of developing it , and we 'll never stop . 
  we 'll be giving someone else money to do something we 'd be perfectly capable of doing ourselves , simple out of indifference and neglect . 
  have to agree with you here , the comment surprised me as well . 
  up until 2009 it was practically a different currency which could theoreticly be exhanged into pound stirling of the same value at its issuing bank . 
  although the bank never needed to hold the money available to do do . 
  in 2009 the same but banks have to actually hold deposits at the bank of england equal to how much they issue . 
  its practically a private currency backed by a hard deposit , not guaranteed the same as an outright boe note . 
  but you guys are weird so you somehow think `` different notes , same currency '' is the right thing to say.dunno why . 
  try explaining that to foreign exhange offices outside the uk . 
  scotland benefits from the cap if independent because they 'll het a bonus for having largely marginal agricultural land . 
  like finland . 
  schengen is entirely optional , as ronania well knows . 
  amd no one is in any hurry of adding new members to the euro , again as romania full knows . 
  i do n't think so . 
  the move from kinship bonds and personal genealogy into group identity of unrelated individuals was an extremely important one . 
  and there were two nationalisms born during that revolution . 
  one universalists and another ethno-chauvinist . 
  and in europe they 've been fighting ever since . 
  and that fight has taken many forms and will keep taking many more . 
  garibaldi was an humanist internationalist , bismark a monarchist turned reluctant blood-and-soil ethno-nationalist , ataturk was a heavy handed civic nationalist , tito was an ambitious pan-nationalist , so on and so forth . 
  this weird struggle is part of who we , collectively are . 
  and i doubt that it will ever end . 
  personally i believe shoving the eu in with post-nationalism is a mistake . 
  post-nationalism to begin with was part of an `` end of history '' paradigm where universalist liberalism would inevitable win and that paradigm has proven bankrupt . 
  a nation is and has always been a polity which self-indentifies as a unitary people , whatever their connection to each other . 
  and in that regard the eu is a continuation , not a replacement . 
  maybe not as exclusivist and ethno-centric as nationalism has tended to be in europe , but inevitably the same forces and principles will apply . 
  it 's ireland , you want free water , put a bucket outside and wait for a bit . 
  scotland is the same and it has no water charge , infrastructure being handled on a council/country level using taxes . 
  the actual domestic usage costs are just so low that in practice it would be more expensive to start charging per use , since metering and billing would add extra overheads . 
  the issue with ireland is that there 's no shortage of water to actually cause rationing or political will to modernize , and because of that the entire system has been allowed to leak extensively . 
  in practice this raises overall costs for everyone , although it should have never come to that point to begin with . 
  what should happen , is that industrial/agricultural/commercial usage should be charge since they 're the ones straining the system and domestic usage should just pay the infrastructure costs involved through their taxes . 
  and by fixing the leaking infrastructure they could do that , just like in scotland . 
  it 's all up in the air . 
  it depends if negotiations limit to only payment of promissory arrangements , or it extends negotiations to asset/liability partitions . 
  in the former , the normal arrangement of payment both ways will be structured as set out in the multi-annual financial frameworks on both sides . 
  in the later , a formula has to be agreed about to tally the values involved and distribute them . 
  although i think this will be taken off the table since for the uk the net value is negative ( despite johnson 's claims otherwise ) and for the eu the precedent is toxic . 
  who is `` le marechal '' the americans are speaking of ? 
  or is it just them not getting who `` le general '' is referring to ? 
  i actually do n't know how much custom 's paperwork is involved if any . 
  we are technically within the customs union , but at the same time [ there has to be registration of the physical volume of goods passing through ] ( http://www.sabian.ro/directia-schengen-frontiera-transport-marfa-proceduri-vamala-consultanta/ ) . 
  i imagine someone working with this confusion in a corporate environment would prefer not to suffer the headache and , as you say , choose hungary . 
  it might actually be better since it gives it permanent residents , who sport high education and income . 
  while the traveling circus is more like a temporary boost a few days a month . 
  that 's pretty much it , just delays . 
  but delays matter when you 're dealing in bulk . 
  and even that 1 hour train stop between budapest and timisoara for travelers would make organizing a cross-border company a tiny bit less worthwhile . 
  it does impact commerce , but is not against eu competition rules . 
  ultimately it 's not fair , which is why schengen exists to begin with . 
  but it 's not illegal , it 's just the reality of having security checks at borders . 
  that 's a bit extreme , practically calling for guilt by association . 
  that being said , the issue is that nothing that is happening is illegal . 
  the hq has to be somewhere , trade is happening everywhere in the eu , so the location will never please everyone if we are taxing on hq location . 
  we either need a pan-european tax system that maxes hq location irrelevant in the union , or we need to abandon the hq system altogether and re-model the entire tax system to take into account other aspects . 
  i 'd argue that we 'd have to remodel the entire corporate structure system eventually , because the very concept of a hq is becoming increasingly meaningless but that 's outside of anything i can speculate on safely . 
  1970s and 1980 had their own brand of euroskepticism resulting from the the empty chair crisis and the resulting luxembourg compromise . 
  back then euroskepticism , much like european politics in general , was a closed doors affair between politicians . 
  this was also the age of euro-sclerosis , where economic stagnation was paralleled by a collapse of european political initiative . 
  the 1990s were a response to that age and saw a massive push for european integration , the creation of the single market , and our last great period of prosperity . 
  ( well , in the west , arguably not in the east ) the 2000s-early 2010s were a response to that and the return of euroskepticism as a popular force , and again eurosclerosis . 
  we 're stuck in a cycle . 
  the bill just got 10 billion euro bigger . 
   i was saying france are trying to impose a tax regime , as you agreed later in the post . 
  one that just so happens to benefit them greatly . 
  this is at least the second time they have pushed for minimum tax rates . 
  and it 's within their right to push , and within the rights of everyone else to disagree and push back . 
  it 's called politics . 
   why do you think that ? 
  any company could have set up that tax structure so by definition was n't a special deal for apple ? 
  [ here ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/apple-s-irish-company-structure-key-to-eu-tax-finding-1.2775684 )  but unlike the other big players it was moving money around within two bits of one company , rather than between two separate companies .

  intellectual inquiry uses premises and arguments to eventually arrive at a conclusion . 
  debates have adversaries already having the conclusion set , and then trying to pick winning arguments and premises . 
  debates allow for intellectual dishonesty , rhetorical devices , loose logic and interpretation , has no fact checking , and , pet peeve , it really advantages those who are able to simply ` plough through ' with confidence . 
  boris knows that , look at the video , he treats it as a game where if he can keep talking he will win . 
  plays the galery for cheap laughs ( `` hop-on , hop-off , hoplites '' ) . 
  i 'm not saying debates do n't have value , btw . 
  just little to no intellectual value . 
  rhetoric invites a different set of skills . 
   yes , if you stand on your head and sing company anthem you 'll probably get bonus points . 
  bottom line is that we live in a world with 7 000\u00a0000\u00a0000 people and there is not an `` unconventional '' way for every one of them . 
  extreme majority of people are hired through conventional channels and that will not change . 
  there 's `` normal bloke '' conventional , and there 's `` industrial niche '' conventional . 
  if you 're good at your job , at some point you 'll start receiving calls from headhunters who 's job it is to get you to quit your job and get hired by their clients . 
  until then , you 're going to meet most of your future employers at conventions , congresses and expos . 
  before that , your fellow alumni and former professors are good go-tos . 
  but `` looking at adds '' is being at the very bottom , people who do all of the above have a far better chance than you ever do doing that . 
   nowadays i do n't have to talk with anybody from bank about my account . 
  i can even split every expense with my friends without having to talk to them . 
  the user facing jobs are going away , not the skilled jobs . 
  not everybody will be in management like you would be . 
  i 'm not talking from a consumer `` user facing '' point of view . 
  all the good jobs will be , well not necesarilly `` management '' but in the control centers of the automated systems . 
  project teams , support teams , industrial representative , coordinating with contractors . 
  employers are asking for more people-oriented skills from the stem undergrads because they 're finding that their `` skilled jobs '' needed to actually be able to deal with holding a 15 minute debrief of their progress every weak without mumbling . 
  or being able to discuss expectations with contractors . 
  or being part of the team dealing with the client , where the client is n't `` some guy '' but a large company . 
   but if you 're talking about such a undersaturated market , i do n't know why bother to do anything . 
  essentially it 's the jobs who are looking for me , not vice versa . 
  having to deal with the very real present trend of companies not wanting to spend money training new people , trust me , there is n't really a `` undersaturated market '' . 
  niche expertise gets good pull , but simply having a degree feels like it is n't enough even in engineering . 
   that 's not the case for most people and especially for the erasmus graduates with impressive drinking skills but no real , hard skills whatsoever . 
  keep underestimating the value , that 's fine . 
  but someone with really good hard skills no one knows about is going to loose to someone with good enough hard skills that knows 5 people in his industry in 5 different countries . 
  if turkey reforms so it upholds european values and goals it should be let in . 
  if turkey does n't , it should n't . 
  it 's the only fair way to go about it . 
  europe is full of culturally , historically and religiously christian countries , who 's values have slowly been changing since the enlightenment started a chain reaction of secularism which saw the old traditions and dogma fall out of fashion . 
  the modern europe puts more faith in those secular values and spends no time trying to figure out which parts of corinthians they should make into laws . 
  turkey was modernized by ataturk , and it could have continued on the european path of undermining the abrahamic desert traditions if not for it 's poverty . 
  it can still continue on that path if we help it . 
  see , people keep pointing out his etonite oxbridge qualifications . 
  but his `` act '' is a consistent string of goofs and lies , to the point you have to question if it 's an act . 
  this is a man who was about to publish an article where his erudite telling of the saving of eurydice by heracles would have fallen afoul of his inability to do a google search , let alone remember his classics . 
  boris johnson is perhaps the posterchild of how much education can do for a man , despite personal qualities , and the importance of the right schooling to getting ahead . 
  a debate ? 
  no , those are rhetorical contests to sharpen the art of stretching the truth to uphold a point . 
  having had the pleasure of seeing the debating society of guu , i can safely say that debating can be a truly intellectually vacuous environment . 
  boris johnson is educated , some might say beyond his intelligence . 
  but he 's definitely not intellectual . 
  he 's more than a bit of a bloke . 
   what do you want people to do ? 
  start companies right after university ? 
  that 's the recipe for disaster i think . 
  universities in the west are actually giving students and recent alumni money if they start a company in/right after university . 
  will it likely lead to disaster ? 
  yea , most likely . 
  but you know what , companies eat that up . 
  you started a company , created a proposal , tried and failed ? 
  well , shows initiative and experience , and you get one up from mihai geogescu who 's top of the class but ca n't wrap his head around doing anything that is not in a specification document . 
  someone in india can do that cheaper and just as well . 
   you had some bad experiences ? 
  i 'm not familiar with working at bank at all . 
  friends have bad experiences . 
  the money was to good , so they went for it . 
  but those banks expect their money 's worth . 
  so you get roped into a bureaucratic office environment which tries to milk you for any excess time you have to work on whatever proprietary crap the management decided to go with . 
  there 's better tech enviroments , although if you 're willing to climb the corporate ladder likely not better money unless you sink yourself into the right start-up , which after a few years of hitting your head against that mess seems like a breeze . 
   i think you have really bad experience with your school . 
  in my opinion , this attitude grants opportunities , and it 's not at all about `` shoving '' people somewhere . 
  you have classes you can attend , clubs , even themed camps . 
  there are national olympiads in different subjects and we are encouraged to participate . 
  most people i know are happy about their choices and there is no problem to change class if you do n't like it . 
  heh , i guess i was on the poorer end of the spectrum . 
  if you needed more than a pen and paper to do it , you did n't do it . 
  did go to the olympiad . 
  for me and my sister it definitely felt pushed , we 've since learned that the world is a lot more complicated than we were taught . 
  life does n't have to be shirt-tie at a microsoft subsidiary , fighting for management , which is what we could hope for in the home country . 
   oh , so whole of this `` networking '' could be done as easily as looking at job search sites and job board at university ? 
  ok . are you serious ? 
  you are are n't you ? 
  trust me , you do n't want to find yourself in the `` looking at listing '' end of things . 
  too much competition , and many are just there so the company can say the tried to find someone , when in fact they already picked put have to do it out of company/national rules . 
  sending emails to see if positions are available is better . 
  so is having friends tell you of gaps in the company . 
  you always get bonus points for going through unorthodox channels . 
   we had ib at my school . 
  i do n't think it was paid though , and it was public school . 
  mostly people who want to be businessman/managers go there . 
  i do n't really like this approach , public speaking et cetera . 
  better to leave this to people who enjoy it and are good at it . 
  but yeah , if that 's what you want go for it . 
  here 's the thing about that . 
  you have to be good at that , at least good enough . 
  because the rule for the next few decades is : `` if your job can be done by a computer , it will '' . 
  so the one thing that you have as a human is your ability to present and relate to other humans , or be creative , anything else is in the front line of automation or outsourcing to a new african country that has the internet . 
   yeah , `` i 'm going to employ this inexperienced novice programmer over this java expert because he spend a month in puppy shelter ! '' . 
  just what the fuck . 
  the actual example i had was `` i will employ this tattooed middle aged dude with an impressive github portfolio who has n't had a job for a year , over the certificated university blokes . '', 
  this was for the bbc . 
  apparently , it was a good choice .

  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_language#lexicon ) half of their vocabulary is non-european , although indo-european languages eventually shaped the other 50 % through areal influence . 
  slavic is the biggest it seems , more than us in fact . 
  why they ca n't just go to gdansk directly ? 
  it 's confirmation bias and by extension arbitrary . 
  your discourse leading up that paragraph seemed very much to suggest some sort of influence to the choice . 
  even if that is not the case , i do n't really find any value in it . 
  they are just common words meant to transmit basic ideas . 
  stop ascribing this sort of ad hoc significance to them . 
  the it by stephen king has come back with a vengeance , and is now after adult blood . 
  no , * you see * , they 're trying to justify that what they are doing is taking out the bad apples that might poison their supremacist ideology . 
  thus they ensure that no rationality penetrates their ivory tower . 
  interesting that you did n't respond to my second paragraph which offered a perfect analogy for your nitpicking . 
  because that 's what it is . 
  what you find fascinating is your own business , but i have a bone to pick with the fact that you consider the word choice as something relevant to a purely political choice , almost endorsing it as some sort of influence . 
  my point still stands . 
  it 's completely arbitrary and irrelevant ; nothing more than confirmation bias . 
  imagine tomorrow romania would have a vote to leave or remain in the eu , using the words `` par\u0103si '' and `` r\u0103m\u00e2ne '' respectively . 
  obviously the former is a representation of our orientation towards evil russia , and exploring our barbaric slavic roots . 
  the latter is the glorious latin heritage , the beautiful french language that modernized our country in the 19th-20th century . 
  reflect on those interesting parallels and contemplate how worthless they really are in the grand scheme of things . 
  [ their successors seemed pretty darn french though ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angevin_empire ), 
   when the electoral commission approved the wording of the referendum question i was delighted . 
  `` leave '' is a good old anglo-saxon word , whereas `` remain '' is one of those new french words that the normans brought over . 
  one of those words would hit our hearts , the other one would n't . 
  so you 're to trying to justify brexit with arbitrary linguistic emotional claims ? 
  count me in too . 
  title seems misleading . 
  [ wikipedia says ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mediterranean_recluse_spider ) : * despite co-occurrence with humans for millennia , there is only a single report of a human fatality linked to a bite from this species , a case report from 2016 in which no spider was captured for a confirmed identification , and in which the victim suffered from an autoimmune disorder ( myasthenia gravis ) . 
  [ 3 ] * the women in question was 65 years old , although the effects should not be ignored even in the case of a healthy person . 
  the bite is necrotic and can cause complications that are medically significant . 
  it 's okay . 
  i 'll take the downvote . 
  it 's not like satirical rhetoric is easy to spot on the internet .

   everyone !, 
  lets go back to antiquity !, 
  let 's go back to having 6 child families , less than half of today 's life expectancy and constant warfare ? 
  because rome ripped-off the greeks ? 
  they had much cultural exchange considering that hellenic culture was flourishing after alexander as the republic started to expand . 
  democracy , military tactics , philosophy and so on were very much influenced by the greeks . 
  it 's the very reason why the legacy is often called greeco-roman . 
  and yes , you 're right that the greeks were very successful despite the odds being stacked against them . 
  they probably never would . 
  there was , and still is , an arab minority in the last centuries , but the iranians have historically had much animosity towards the chosen people of allah . 
   the only other civilisation even comparable to them were the chinese , but even then most of that legacy came significantly after the greeks had essentially finished their absolutely remarkably run of achievements . 
  depends . 
  the egyptian civilization was also a great one , considering there is an entire branch dedicated to their study . 
  or the persians , who were arguably the greatest ancient civilization of the middle east and considered one of earliest , if not the first , [ empire . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/achaemenid_empire ) people like alexander the great owe much to them , since they laid the foundation for west-east contact . 
  the russian exclave has been awkward for decades now . 
  although there is a polish minority in belarus at the border ... hmm ... 
   eastern european  finnish flair were you under the iron curtain ? 
  be absorbed by poland and revive a glorious era from the past ? 
  i hate the two candidates dominance in politics in general . 
  makes it such a false dilemma . 
  3rd options are considered a waste of votes , especially when one of those two factions sometimes call you out on that . 
  wait , if this is so obvious then what possible argument do nay-sayers have ? 
  also , the 66 loss is after 15 years , so slightly editorialized title . 
  any commentary from russia 's dearest leader or did he stop caring about all the fun that 's been thrown at him through the years ? 
  man , i 'm so envious of your oceanic influence . 
  we typically get snowfall as early as middle november at times , typically late november . 
  it can get really darn cold at night , especially when you consider our communist buildings do n't have the most ideal of heating . 
  it 's around ~ 12 degrees in the capital atm , although we wo n't pass 16 this week according to the prognosis . 
  danish . 
  swedish . 
  generally the nordic group . 
  [ take a look for yourself ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_phonology#sample ), 
   ireland signed away its sovereignty when it adopted the euro . 
  care to expand on that ? 
  if you think english is stupid with spelling , or phonology in general really , you should see other germanic languages . 
  you 'll want to thank the roman empire for latin influence . 
  there goes starting off smooth down the drain ... 
  how 's the weather there these days ? 
  i assume they emigrated to finland/norway or went to bigger cities in russia , like saint petersburg ? 
  would n't there be a public outcry if that occured ? 
  i never knew murmansk could be so populated . 
  you do n't see many lights in scandinavia to the west in comparison , at the same latitude obviously . 
  why is it so ? 
  is it just politics ? 
  economy ? 
  geography ? 
  culture ? 
  so then should you scrap it and adopt the eu customs ( they already have met some of the criteria you mentioned shared by many other countries ) or stay in the eea and mind your own business ? 
  the former seems silly to me considering you worked on it for half a century . 
  do n't you already have the nordic council ? 
  you could expand on that .

  the 15 counties above the national average are split 8-7 between west and south . 
  if all people who ca n't find work leave the county , then all the remainder is 100 % employed . 
  i 'm more intrigued with northern moldavia and oltenia having better rates than most of europe ? 
  these are notoriously poor zones . 
  perhaps all young people left ?

  i [ mis ] read the whole thread in a hurry as i was leaving the office , and thought it was the `` evil nationalists pushed french on the people '' thing . 
  for _ frigid _ , an english speaking person will likely understand it as [ intensely cold ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/frigid ) , more so given the context . 
  as a romanian , i would n't have been mislead if the feminine _ frigid\u0103 _ was used instead . 
  there are many problems with that article . 
  first , if you look at the word examples , it seems the person who compiled the list is not a native speaker . 
  no , _ frigid _ does not men cold  and agil , really ? 
  when did you last hear someone using that word ? 
  dentist did not replace any previous word ( and has no synonyms ) , it came about with the profession ; neither did acvatic , a technical term . 
  direct has no slavic counterpart afaik , the same word exists in serbo-croatian ( per google translate ) and there is no other single word to fully describe the concept ( nemijlocit is a partial synonym in full current use ) . 
  rapid is the only word in the list that may seem truly unnecessary - but it did not replace iute . 
  relatinization was much vilified , and i suspect russian `` influence '' had something to do with it . 
  from what i could piece from later colleagues , most had had english as either main or secondary ( and my so concurs ) . 
  i took private french classes , which would n't have happened if english-french would have been available in my school ( in bucharest ) . 
  i 'm not sure this varied with time , but rather with the specific school , as they probably could n't hire too many foreign language teachers , so had to keep the same combo [ s ] over time . 
  the school nearest to my house had italian as main , at least for some of the classes . 
  actually , english was perhaps the most taught foreign language since at least the seventies . 
  i do n't have any figures , but that was my impression . 
  foreign languages were taught in combos of `` main '' ( starting in second grade ) and `` secondary '' ( starting in the fifth ) continuing until the twelfth grade . 
  the most common was english-russian , followed by german-french . 
  other combinations existed as well . 
  some schools had both foreign languages starting in the fifth grade . 
  i contend it 's called : engrish . 
   they can claim funding roughly proportionate to the amount of votes they get . 
  i sort of expected that , but this is what i find curious . 
  such `` party '' foundations serve to further the party 's agenda and proselytize , and proportionality makes things worse , sort of a positive feedback loop . 
  this system favours the strong , and i find this rather unsettling . 
  romania aside , i do n't really understand this system . 
  i gather german political parties may claim state funding for their `` associated '' foundations , e.g. 
  the kaf gets some [ 97 % ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/konrad_adenauer_foundation#finances ) of its money ( $ 120m ! ), 
  from the state . 
  what purpose could this serve ? 
   the tragicomedy of greece continues !, 
  which part did you find comical ? 
  i did n't read anything by hertha muller , but talking about dissent literature , ** paul goma ** should be mentioned , as well as ** ion ioanid ** . 
  romanian . 
  it 's simply killing me . 
   the fact that north and south korean border guards can blare insults at each other , and be understood , is why the border will disappear when the north 's regime does . 
  i 'm a sucker for this kind of reverie , but one should remember that serbs , croatians and bosnians were free to hurl insults at each other , and be understood , before there was any real border between them . 
  i know this will hurt some people here , and i apologize for that , but one should be weary of wishful thinking and this needed be said . 
  interesting choice , perhaps you could elaborate ? 
  i did n't travel enough to make comparisons , but i did spend a couple of months in athens , and loved it . 
  it 's mostly about the people , friendly and considerate , and they always looked so relaxed , even when talking passionately . 
  the one place where you can go people-spotting . 
  and whatever might be construed as a flaw was familiar from romanians , so it did n't really bother me . 
  also , i never understood the `` greeks are lazy '' mantra . 
  many people i knew had a second job , some worked another during the weekend . 
  for those who only get the first paragraph , here 's the [ reuters ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/12/hungary-energy-prices-idusl5e8nc92w20121212 ) piece . 
  what you say about america is not entirely true . 
  the presidential pension was invented for harry truman , who after leaving the presidency had a pension of about $ 100 / month and lived by selling inherited some property ( [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harry_s._truman#post-presidency ) ) . 
  every once or twice in a century there is an honest politician in any given country , there may be more in finland , i honestly have no idea . 
   we had centrally planned economy for 50 years , and everybody remembers where it leads . 
  from what i remember , it leads to a free black market taking over the consumer goods distribution , while the industrial market crumbles in all sorts of underhand deals designed to make managers appear to accomplish the party 's vision . 
  the most insidious result being large scale corruption at all levels of the society . 
  it is generally accepted that one should bribe doctors and nurses here . 
  i did it three times ( twice money , once flowers ) , unsolicited , and have been refused four times , despite my insistence . 
  i have never personally been asked for anything , this extends to my so and her family . 
  flyingorange 's [ comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/15o5ig/how_many_of_you_have_given_a_present_to_your/c7o8u52 ) applies as well , if seeing the same doctor regularly , one would act as in any visit , bring some flowers or candy , or more expensive items depending on the issue . 
  this fall in a grey area between present and bribe . 
  this in the free system , which currently gives way to a private system where - to my knowledge - bribe is neither solicited nor accepted . 
  even so , it seems more expensive than the former . 
  just walked the dog , i can confirm we are enjoying a grey christmas , with melting snow everywhere . 
  bucharest , why ? 
  about -3 right now . 
  pretty white outside . 
  +7 announced for tomorrow , though . 
  way above normal temperatures for this time of year . 
  we 're not celebrating christmas eve as such , but christmas begins at midnight on the 25-th , many ( most ? ), 
  will start feasting at that time . 
  edit : ugh . 
  there 's plenty of tradition re christmas eve , i.e. 
  [ colinde ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colind%c4%83 ) . 
  i was thinking in terms of feasting , which you can ' r really do on a fasting day , with no meat , milk , eggs and fish . 
  the feast _ should _ start after midnight , then you can eat and drink too much , and post rubbish on reddit ... 
  [ the etymology is disputed ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/craciun ) also , [ cioranescu ] ( http://dexonline.ro/definitie/cr%c4%83ciun/442663 ) ( der ) , while agreeing the etymology is not clear , states that `` the slavic etymons do not seem possible '' - i sort of prefer der over conflicting wikipedia articles . 
   in ukraine , more than 80 lives were claimed and more than 500 people hospitalised after temperatures dropped and stayed at minus 17 celsius . 
  this ca n't be the whole story , -17 is really not that bad . 
  we get that every other winter in bucharest , it 's harsh , but not deadly , as long as you do n't sleep outside . 
  any ukrainian folks to fill us in on what 's really going on ? 
   i 'm not saying it 's the right thing to do , and not my personal position on this , just trying to answer your question . 
  well , i do n't think there is a single romanian view just as there is no single hungarian view on that . 
  for one thing , in part of the ardeal ( where hungarian minorities reside ) , it 's bound to be different that in the east or south . 
  one thing to note , we do n't see ourselves that much as ` east ' ( or hungarians as ` west ' ) , whatever is singular to our identity is pretty much [ old enough ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/romania/comments/146lu7/any_insight_would_be_helpful_mul%c8%9bumesc/c7c4a2d ) as to transcend such divisions . 
  if anything , we see ourselves as a romance culture , descendents of the roman empire , that 's as western as it can get here . 
  it 's not really that important how exact that is historically ( just as the `` 1000 years '' ) , this is the perception . 
  i do n't think there is much antagonism between the two states , outside the nationalist movements , and those are not that much of a big deal here . 
  but i think there is some resentment in romania for the rather well documented 19th century situation in ardeal ( if 1000 years is exaggerated ) . 
  i 'm not saying we 're angels , and the irony of denying [ some ] native-language rights to a minority is not lost on those who read how the same was denied to romanians under austria-hungary . 
  so there is an unofficial hatchet to bury . 
  i 'm not sure how that can be done . 
  i suppose that if a hungarian govt would come forth and say ` sorry for that shit in our common past , let 's put that behind us ' , it would be well received by most here - i 'm not saying it 's the right thing to do , and not my personal position on this , just trying to answer your question . 
  well , yes , but compare this with the issue of ardeal with hungary , the cadrilater story with bulgaria , the basarabia issue with ukraine , the [ republic of ] moldavia issue with russia , and the much older disputes with poland . 
  feel free to expand to other historical territorial issues ( e.g. 
  anglo-french ) in europe .

  of course you do n't accept , but you also know that the phone is gone , and it ai n't coming back . 
   will they feel betrayed by the us and eu ? 
  no , they wo n't . 
  unless the us and the eu accept formally that putin is right . 
  which they wo n't do . 
   i do n't see how putin is n't winning in that scenario . 
  who said he is n't ? 
  the endgame now is to prevent him invading the rest of ukraine . 
  crimea is lost , and the west knows it , but they ca n't come out and just say it . 
   if us and the eu let putin keep crimea they wo n't accept putin taking crimea , but they wont go and kick him out either . 
  we 'll just end up with another frozen conflict a la transnistria .

  gulag jokes aside : 1 . 
  [ green ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_ukraine ) - a historical ukrainian name of the land in the russian far east area between the amur river and the pacific ocean . 
  [ ... ] it was named by the ukrainian settlers . 
  the territory consists of over 1,000,000 square kilometres and has a population of 3.1 million ( 1958 ) . 
  the ukrainian population in 1897 made up 15 % of the primorskaya oblast 's population . 
  map : [ ukrainian language in russian empire 1897 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/ukrainian_in_russian_empire_1897.png/1280px-ukrainian_in_russian_empire_1897.png ), 
   a better question is , why does the hungarian alphabet contain q , w , x and y ? 
  those denote no phoneme at all , and are merely included for historical reasons . 
  they are probably also useful for foreign words up until they get hungarianized . 
  at least that 's mostly why romanian has q , w and y. 
   i doubt there are many people considering `` ng '' to be a different letter too  they do in welsh and korean , for example . 
   that 's a great question , and i think / u/bezbojnicul might be more fit to answer , if i recall correctly he 's a linguist thanks for the credit , but i 'm just an amateur in this field . 
  for a professional answer i really suggest asking the fine folks from / r/linguistics . 
  they are actual linguists , with actual degrees ( other than wikipedia uni , like myself )  now , speculating a bit , i think they are listed as `` separate letters '' because they show separate [ phonemes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phonemes ) . 
  also looking at the wikiarticle for [ digraphs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/digraph_\\ ( orthography \\ ) )  a digraph or digram is a pair of characters used to write one phoneme ( distinct sound ) or a sequence of phonemes that does not correspond to the normal values of the two characters combined . 
  the sound is often , but not necessarily , one which can not be expressed using a single character in the orthography used by the language .

  so he can screw us indirectly , sort of .

  no they wo n't .

  he 's got so many columns in crimea he could build a replica of the parthenon . 
   hungarian slovaks do n't want to join hungary and south tyrol mostly does n't want to join austria any data to back this up ? 
   i don \u00b4 t think it is in putins interest to see crimea secede . 
  agreed . 
  a transnistria type scenario ( unrecognized secessionist state ) is much more useful to russia . 
  crimean tatars have n't been a majority since the late 19th century https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimea#ethnic_groups, 
  to be fair , they were n't a majority before the deportations either . 
   it 's seems to be the same situation . 
  how so ? 
  i do n't think the crimean russians are repressed in the way kosovar albanians were in the 90s so as to justify secession . 
  nobody tried to undo the crimean autonomy , nobody barred russians from any post , and the repealing of the language law is hardly comparable to the discrimination of albanians in kosovo . 
  so you guys made a [ m\u0103r\u021bi\u0219or ] ( http://mpnewyork.mae.ro/en/romania-news/375 ) out of it ... 
   if turkish troops stay in northern cyprus it should all be ok . 
  yeah , just like the russian troops in transnistria make it ok for the rest of moldova . 
  it was a stupid move symbolically to begin with . 
  the law might be badly written , but the symbolic weight of repealing a law regarding minority languages as one of the first things in office was huge ( and is especially bothersome in the current context ) . 
  waiting a bit until a new law was written should have been the way to go . 
  good thing the new president has some brains .

  :d still , if there 's one thing i transport out of hungary when i pass through , it 's wine ... 
  last time i was in bratislava , a local friend told me `` try the food , do n't try the beers '' . 
  ca n't remember what brand we had in the end , but even for a lager it was pretty bad . 
  food was great though . 
  funny for a romanian to see `` halusky '' , `` brynzou '' , `` smetana '' and `` slaninou '' ( sorry for the spelling ) in a menu . 
  we call them galuste , branza , smantana and slanina ... 
  silva and silva black are both pretty good , and i do n't usually like dark beer . 
  i also have ursus from time to time , but only because it is or used to be local . 
  what about kru\u0161ovice ? 
  i had it at a festival with beers from central europe and found it much better than anything else on offer , including staropramen ... 
  romania was never part of the ussr . 
  just sayin ' . 
  because the commission has surely been focusing its entire attention on olive oil jugs during the past few weeks ... 
  regarding transylvania , my grandparents have a lot of ( positive ) stories about their armenian , jewish or even slovak friends & classmates from youth , as well as their saxon and hungarian relatives . 
  as i said in another post , while the romanian & hungarian communities are healthy and strong , it 's sad that many of these much smaller communities have faded away , either through emigration or assimilation into the larger society . 
  even the saxons , who were never a ` small ' community before the world war . 
  i imagine transylvania to have been a far more interesting place before those times . 
  i 'm also glad when i hear there has been a slovak festival in those towns near hungary , or that a synagogue is being restored , or that an armenian from a small town manages to be successful in romania . 
  we 've had a small but very kind and prosperous armenian community here in romania for many centuries . 
  [ one of our more well-known ministers of finance in recent years is armenian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varujan_vosganian ) , along with [ the man who reformed our entire education system in the 19th century ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spiru_haret ) and quite a few other famous writers , politicians and scientists . 
  as for the country , i do consider it part of europe , even though i ca n't say i 've met a lot of armenian citizens . 
  i think membership of the council of europe ( rather than the eu ) fits the current status of countries in the caucasus . 
  perhaps in a decade or so they will make bigger steps toward the west , but it 's really up to them to make that choice . 
  haha . 
  despite us being neighbours ( and i live 200km away from the border ) , i had never ever met any ukrainians until last year ( err ... the visa thing might have contributed to that ) , when i befriended a whole bunch . 
  top notch people . 
  i remember what they had to go through when they traveled to france on vacation . 
  i think western europe tends to associate ukraine and belarus with russia , which is sort of saying `` east of poland , there be dragons '' . 
  us and the bulgarians were in the same situation - the further west you go , the less things people know about your country . 
  i do n't mean starting a convo on recent political developments , i mean knowing your capital city . 
  i do n't particularly blame them , i have equally little interest for countries near the caspian sea . 
  being part of this ever-bigger european family is helping a lot . 
  i 'm sure things will also be better for ukraine . 
  even if you 've leaned more towards russia , that country itself is becoming ever more palatable to the western eye . 
  there are russian tourists everywhere , and i 'm seeing much less of the superiority complex both russians and westerners used to have toward one another . 
  i ca n't upvote this enough . 
  good education can only take things in a good direction , and this makes no exception . 
  for them to feel swedish they need to be raised swedish ; proper swedish-oriented education will also give them much higher chances on the labour market ( thus eliminating many problems on the long term ) . 
  leaving them to just sort it out in the ghetto will only make things worse for them and the rest of society . 
  gypsies have a nomadic culture . 
  it 's very hard to even begin to `` integrate '' them into our societies , simply because they have a very different understanding of what a society is . 
  by far the worst problem is their frequent refusal to send their children to school , where they might actually learn to live by our norms . 
  their children are often discriminated against , and often reinforce the stereotypes because of their upbringing . 
  the cycle is very difficult to break . 
  sweden has also let in a lot of unschooled asylum seekers , but i think the vast majority of immigrants would be far easier to integrate , as they idea of society is more similar to ours than that of gypsies . 
  and the key also lies in education . 
  i hope the younger rioters and their children will have a chance to be raised as `` swedish '' . 
  it depends on the government too , but mostly on their parents , and the government can take indirect action in that sense as well . 
  ok , further immigration will be regulated , but how will the lives of these thousands of people already in sweden be changed ? 
  how will they be integrated ? 
  how will sweden make sure their future children ( already second - or even third-generation swedish citizens ) will not face the same future in the ghetto ? 
  the issue runs much deeper - both nations claim to have been the first in transylvania . 
  romanians claim to have never left these lands after the roman conquest of dacia , and hungarians claim they found a mostly empty transylvania when they arrived toward the end of the first millennium ( with the romanians having later emigrated from south of the danube ) . 
  so whoever gets to claim dibs on the origin of the ardeal/erd \u00e9ly name also has a strong argument to have been present here earlier , which in turn has political implications . 
  to someone living here they certainly sound like cognates . 
  ardeal is how we would pronounce the hungarian word with a romanian accent , and erd\u00e9ly is vice-versa . 
  there are similar vowel shifts in a lot of bilingual place names in the region . 
  the two are very likely connected , but in absence of a scientific consensus on their origin i 'll just let you draw your own conclusions : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/historical_names_of_transylvania, 
  aldo , pierluigi ( composite , but still unique to italy ) , placido , ezio , eros , fausto , tarcisio . . ? 
  romanian . 
  `` moldovan '' is a fairly common last name here , as are `` muntean '' ( to designate someone from old wallachia/muntenia ) and `` ardelean '' ( to designate someone from transylvania/ardeal ) . 
  these are the major three historic areas where romanians have lived . 
  muntenia and most of historic moldova united in the 19th century to create modern romania , and then transylvania and the other half of moldova joined in after wwi . 
  that other half of moldova is now a republic , while the rest remains a region of eastern romania . 
  the more you know !, 
  i think it was broadcasted by public stations in every country - with mandatory fees and all that . 
  we just got shafted . 
  names like pleven , vidin and grivitsa pop up a lot in the press today , it was one of our finest hours as neighbours . 
   there is a dark humour joke that our only friendly/peaceful neighbour is the black sea , but i think it 's outdated - we 've become a lot more close on this european road of ours , especially in recent years . 
  we claimed independence from the ottoman empire on this day in 1877 , were then plunged into half a century of communism after this day in 1945 , and now we celebrate it as europe day ... 
  i really hope it stays this way . 
  happy europe day to you , fellow europeans . 
  because i agree with most of the other things you wrote . 
  saying it 's shitty is either some kind of argument or just an insult . 
  so it 's the latter then . 
  oh i 've met hungarians who say they language is `` difficult '' to put it lightly , but any language is at least interesting . 
  the hungarian one is especially interesting just because it sounds so outlandish to us . 
  calling it shitty does n't really contribute to the conversation here , though . 
  it 's just insulting . 
  and the beauty of a language ( which is in the eye - or should i say ear - of the beholder ) does not influence human rights . 
  it 's not like the local community has much to begin with . 
  ethnic romanians do commit crimes ranging from pickpocketing to card fraud , and there are very poor romanians who live in improvised dwellings at the outskirts of french and italian cities . 
  however , there are also plenty of romanian surgeons , architects , engineers , ballerinas , chefs , teachers etc. 
  who live in western cities and contribute very positively to people 's lives there . 
  the trouble is the latter never , ever make the news . 
  as for gypsies , i feel the `` roma '' naming was very unfortunate . 
  i would love to see them integrated , living fulfilling lives for themselves and the people around . 
  i know a few cases of gypsies who 've managed to get themselves through university and who 've even taken it a step beyond by returning to their communities and trying to make a change . 
  i just feel like their voices are drowned in the actions of many of their fellow ethnics , and there really is no easy solution to this , otherwise it would have long stopped being a problem .

  they 're still pushing for these measures after two massive protests . 
  it depends how you look at it . 
  yeah , it 's a cliche message copied from the internet , but there 's been quite a few protests against corruption and against psd in the last few years . 
  big protests . 
  one has to wonder ... how low can psd go ? 
  do they have no limit ? 
  you could also say : `` well , they get voted in , right ? '', 
  and yes , that is a problem , especially when only 40 % of the population voted in recent parliamentary elections , but as a ordinary citizen , you ca n't do much than share your view with your friends , on your social media and try to bring awareness . 
  you ca n't force people . 
  this is an issue that will be solved through education . 
  problem is ... psd has always had either the parliament or the parliament and the government and it 's not in their interest for people to be educated . 
  not to mention their propaganda channel , antena3 , is the most watched television channel in romania . 
  ah , eastern europeans , always the problem . 
  / s if it 's true , it 's quite insulting , especially in an europe who opened its arms to refugees and economic migrants from outside of the eu . 
  i did n't know fanta was german . 
  i agree . 
  we do n't need to become better at the expense of others , we need to become better by actually working together towards a good goal . 
   there is no we . 
  some european nations have been under the supremacy of other european nations until very recently . 
  exactly , but op 's french and he does n't have that perspective . 
  supremacy also sounds a bit ... creepy . 
  we ( eu ) may be better than others in a lot of ways ( healthcare , etc. 
  ) , but the use of the word `` supremacy '' is too much . 
  the germans will be alright . 
  correction : last image is from cluj-napoca . 
  i apparently ca n't edit the description anymore , i do n't know why . 
  probably because i do n't have a imgur account . 
  by `` tearing into '' hollande and merkel , i mean that i would n't have expected for her to talk like that to them , especially to merkel who 's a foreign leader . 
  it has appeal for right wingers , as i said . 
  and i heard hollande is n't very popular among the citizens of france anymore . 
  i know the news were saying this during the big protests . 
  thanks for the better perspective . 
  honestly , although i do not agree with her in the slightest , she had quite some charisma ( for right wingers ) [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/cz4ajgpwpvk?t=10 ) . 
  i was like o.o through the whole thing as she tore into hollande and merkel . 
  well , you have to remember that among the 2m are also : - children - psd/alde voters - really old people who ca n't or do n't want to protest , whether they agree or disagree . 
  - homeless , who have special circumstances, 
  yes , they can pass it before the referendum . 
   cant the president just not approve this pardonne ? 
  he does n't have a say when it comes to emergency ordinances . 
  the eu supports our fight against corruption , but right now , cedo is the biggest player here . 
  - we 're waiting on a referendum over these measures , even if psd tries to push for them despite it . 
  - cedo is supposed to give us a time limit to come up with a plan for our bad prison conditions ( mostly overcrowding ) and then , when we present the measures and they agree ( i think ) , they 'll give us a time limit to implement said measures . 
  it 's really hard for us , for the president and for the opposition to fight against a psd majority in government and parliament who keeps shouting `` the people vote us !!!, 
  some romanians protested over there too . 
  i wonder what people who pass think . 
  hehe, 
  yes , he did , but psd who rules both the parliament and the government is still pushing for it . 
  it 's really a mess . 
  and mashed fruits and vegetables . 
  i just got home 20 minutes ago . 
  #congrats to everyone who was there !, 
   obligation not an obligation . 
  important and logical action ? 
  yes . 
  obligation ? 
  a question for you : trump may be dismissive of this , but you do not realize that it is in us 's interest for europe to be stable ? 
  to not fall in russia 's arms ? 
  this is not a kind gesture , this is interest . 
  while i agree with the first part of your comment , i 've never heard them `` rallying against immigration '' . 
  well , why do n't you kick us out then ? 
  remake the treaties so that you can . 
  we 're just second hand countries after all , are n't we ? 
  we do n't share your values , we 've weakened the strong eu , etc. 
  that 's such an insulting comment , i do n't even know how else to take it . 
  we did fulfill the criteria years ago . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  we even paid lots of money on all the equipment we needed for it , but the netherlands is blocking us constantly . 
  there are other countries too , but tn seems very keen to keep us out . 
  schengen is about the movement of goods and less about the movement of the people , which we already have . 
  if uk develops a good majority in favor of the eu , who wants the uk to be committed to the eu , then yeah , of course . 
  but joining eu again soon is n't the solution , even if in a year it could be 50,1 % for eu . 
  well , uk already had that . 
  it did n't work for them . . 
  they chose to end it , even with the opt outs . 
  why would we try a second time ? 
  we also ca n't have uk come in and then go out and then come in and then out and in and out ... 
  it 's not okay . 
   and schengen . 
  apparently the eu does n't care about certain countries meeting the criteria for schengen for years now ... 
  some countries get opt outs , others get a pat on the back . 
   even with opt-outs is obviously better for the eu no it 's not . 
  either integrate or stay out . 
  no reason to half ass things . 
  we know where it leads . 
  no , i do n't think so . 
  since 2012 , we have n't had a really violent protest , and at the colectiv protests ( 2015 ) there were around 50.000 people in bucharest alone . 
  that 's when our government resigned and that was a psd government too . 
  the pm back then later admitted that he was afraid of a protest similar to ukraine 's maidan . 
  but we 're not sure that was the real reason . 
  but now the stakes are higher for them so the best we could hope is that they back down from these measures . 
  if they 'll try to get aggressive , i imagine even more people will take to the streets . 
  we usually protest peacefully so the message would n't be diverted or so they would n't have a reason to call us anarchists or something . 
  it 's been harder to stop the propaganda lately though . 
  the most watched television channel antena3 is rolling out psd propaganda like no tomorrow . 
  they were calling our protest last sunday a `` coup d'etat '' . 
  and there 's another channel that does the same , but worse . 
  they were saying how we were paid , how we were paid to bring dogs and look all scary ( some people brought their dogs to the march because why not ? ) . 
  our president and the opposition is supporting us , but that does n't mean we 're paid by them to protest . 
  yes , they will try . 
  they said they 're not backing down although the president will organize a referendum .

  russia is waging a subversive media war grander than any on the whole west , not just ukraine . 
  the difference is in ukraine there are also tanks and buks . 
  anything goes when fighting the red scourge . 
  well , not anything . 
  not breaching the geneva convention and not cluster bombs . 
  given how ansolutely useless and corrupt ukraine 's counter intelligence is , they can at least , reasonably , ban the overt media propaganda of their ** aggressive invading enemy ** . 
  good . 
  60 % would vote to stay in the eu according to yougov . 
  what do you mean by `` britain next '' ? 
  it 's extraordinarily unlikely either of these nations will leave the eu, 
  i 'm a conservative . 
  i want a strong state ( or states ) , with strong institutions based on western values , with no tolerance to cultural relativity when it comes to laws and regulations ... and regarding the article 's title : ** what exactly is the problem with this ? 
  ** sure , there 's fringe elements that refuse to integrate but by and large most muslims that settle here are european citizens , not only by name , but also in practice . 
  we 're dealing with a heavy demographic crisis . 
  instead of asking ourselves how to keep those people out , why not attempt to integrate them better and tackle the causes that determine extremists acts ? 
  ( disenfranchisement , inequality ) also , 10 % is not that significant for such a large timespan . 
  do you even fucking remember the separatists state one year ago ? 
  before kremlin 's heavy involvement ? 
  they were pushed to the damned border , with some pockets of resistance in the cities . 
  if russia wants to cut its losses , the terrorists will be annihilated in no time . 
  you 're too small to matter . 
  if you fight against progress , human rights and development , progress will fight back . 
  why should that happen though ? 
  why should people flee or die when you serbs can just continue on the path of euroatlantic integration ? 
  are you not getting tired of your neighbours overtaking you economically , in terms of security , and in terms of international reputation ? 
  as a disclaimer , i love serbian history and our countries have traditionally been close together ( romania is a nato country that does n't recognize kosovo ) . 
  i also believe kosovo should n't have been idependent but autonomous . 
  but now its 2015 and it 's time to think and move forward , and the way forward is not east . 
  except those massacred by serbs kek . 
  it 's not `` basically a military occupation '' , it is a military occupation . 
  and a just one . 
  and then belgrade will be in flames again . 
  you 're not helping the stereotype that you all have genocidal tendencies , you know that . 
  source ? 
  yougov pegs the percentage of those who 'd vote for brexit at 40 % and continuously dwindling . 
  the myth that the british people are isolationist ukip drones simply does n't represent reality , as much as misguided anti-europeans would have you believe . 
  that saturation though ... looks really unnatural . 
  no , it 's actually about the armaments . 
  serious military analysts are increasingly discounting the importance of avionics in an age where air capability is mostly reduced to the quality of what the platform is armed with . 
  whenever i read that endlessly reposted fucking article ( by hippies and putinbots ) about why the f-35 supposedly `` sucks '' i ca n't help but cringe . 
  it 's not about how they fly , it 's about the armaments . 
  i do n't genuinely believe you are paid by any kremlin-funded institution . 
  putinbot is just a general term for actual russian trolls and useful idiots alike - both serving the same subversive purposes , wittingly or not . 
  i am studying international law and policy with our actual foreign minister , so no , just because i have morals does n't make me `` oblivious to geopolitics '' . 
  there are other schools of thought besides sociopathic realists that see the world in spheres of influence , like kissinger , mearsheimer . 
  or redditors that think arguing for appeasement in a realpolitik context makes them seem smart . 
  we are in a `` us vs them '' situation , and not by our doing . 
  the problem is a lot of misguided people like you resort to false equivalencies and a supposed neutrality ( which is just disguised anti-americanism , that 's what 's all about for people like you ) . 
  that is also why you are them , and you are the enemy of the free world . 
  no quarter to aggressive expansionist fascists ; no sympathy to those who support them . 
  that is the way it should be . 
  putinbots like you are just surprised the western public is n't as spineless as you thought or as comfortable as our leaders . 
  even so , that was in the aftermath of the most destructive and shocking terrorist attack in history . 
  americans had all the reason to feel scared , attacked and desire a strong leader . 
  the whole ukrainian debacle is on the backdrop of a decade of fruitful , peaceful and even friendly cooperation between russia and the west - the same decade providing huge economic growth in russia . 
  the russian people have no excuse for being so brainwashed , and i have no sympathy for their current economic hardships . 
  that 's quite informative and puts things in perspective . 
  all the polls i 'm reading show very favorable numbers for the tories . 
  it 's not surprising , as the uk has been one of the fastest growing economies in europe the past two years , on most metrics . 
  yougov shows preference for brexit at about 40 % , so it 's very likely people would also vote to remain in the eu next year . 
  yes , i do support russia 's claim to chechenya . 
  what is the problem with bombing armed , rebellious , violent , externally supported separatists ? 
  maybe if ukraine was armed with precise artillery they would n't have to resort to cluster bombs to fight off an invasion . 
  english is the international language because no other linguistic group is tied to the international power and influence of the anglosphere . 
  there really is n't any other reason . 
  languages do n't come about , gain influence and fade due to practicality , or hungarian and romanian should never have existed and we 'd all be speaking esperanto . 
  i , for one , have been forced to study french 4 years in high school and i can barely form a few phrases . 
  i love french culture and history - more than british - but for the love of god , this language is so atrocious and phonetically disgusting that ... it just makes me feel queasy to hear french spoken . 
  and it was easy to study for a romanian because the grammar is extremely similar . 
  with english , even though i 've never lived in an english speaking country , it 's the language i think in 50 % of the time . 
  the author of the article really is the stereotypical pre-entente french anglophobe , with fewer robust arguments than thesaurus tabs open . 
  this is way strange . 
  there 's no great differences in economic growth , public debt , human development index or in other socio-economic markers - romania and bulgaria will probably be classified as `` very high hd '' next year or in 2017 . 
  i never figured bulgarians would be so pessimistic as the media here in romania loves to complain a lot and they 're showing bulgaria as a model in many ways ( eg : tourism industry ), 
  why do you have to be a cunt about it though ? 
  most british people are not ukip drones . 
  i find it very hard to believe you have n't met good looking women , but maybe you just exchanged your native basement with another . 
  all hail glorious erd\u00e8lyan master race . 
  all slaves were freed from wallachia in 1843 before its abolition in both principalities by 1856 ( djuvara , `` intre orient \u015fi occident . 
  in contrast , serfdom was abolished in the empire in 1848 , which , of course , is not the same thing , but it speaks about the presumed differences in progress between transylvania and the rest . 
  he 's downvoted for being a complete shitbag and wrong about everything else except for knowing wallachia is muntenia . 
  he literally used the word `` mitic '' . 
  that article on `` weirds '' is the best summarization of the flaws in post-modern thinking , and it also explains convincingly the social dangers of this change of paradigm . 
  it 's what hooked me to the blog . 
  it absolutely true the weirds are so devoted to advocating for a culture that would take all their most valued rights away , whilst criticizing the western culture that guarantees them ... just because it 's dominant . 
  he 's not saying all these entities are connected , just that they are organically and unfortunately growing to antisocial extremes . 
  but i still mostly disagree on his assessment of obama because it just feels like american right wing pundit speak . 
  on islam , he basically postulates no change in policy and is ** explicitly against immigration control for muslims ** ( of course , that would be insane ) , promoting just a change in attitude . 
  wall street journal and the economist , like others have said . 
  the level of content on [foreignpolicy.com ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/ ) is likewise very insightful and worth the paywall . 
  for military , intelligence and security matters , [ this guy 's musings are absolutely great ] ( http://20committee.com/ ) . 
  it 's administered by an ex-sigint operator . 
  though he has his own biases towards the conservative side of america , he is very vocally against the melding of corporate interests with military matters and how it 's rightfully ruining the trust in america 's military . 
  also , against the middle eastern wars . 
  if you want to read a rational mildly conservative viewpoint , this would be it . 
  it 's unlikely someone with actual technical knowledge of such operations would write for the guardian or msnbc . 
  romania lost moldavia and larger population than all the ethnic hungarians lost in trianon in all countries their empire was overlord over , and there is no such thing . 
  there was one rather influential party in the 90s but now it 's a running joke . 
  there 's also the fact in every census since the early modern era , romanians have been the majority in transylvania , and for a large portion of that history , they were second class citizens . 
  hungarian claims are not justified by anything except literal imperialism , nostalgia for domination and their regressive stance is unreasonable to empathize with in a modern world .

  this is not a negative comment . 
  so much is lost in nuance in writting . 
  especially in poor writting , 
  i do n't see it as negative . 
  it 's a nice thing to do . 
  i was just observing the fact that they take some predetermined actions in places they stay to make themselves liked by locals rather than this being something spontaneous . 
  which is a smart thing to do . 
  i fear that i may have expressed this the wrong way after the tsunami of downvotes . . 
  yep . 
  for romanians it probably means moldovans who are in most part of romanian ethnicity , or serbs with whom we have an unexplained love affair . . 
  average not minimal . . 
  probably the most educated , so the most effective . 
  hence the most dangerous . 
  good god these blokes are in for a wild ride . 
  and it ai n't to disneyland . 
  they pulled that shit in romania also accompanied by media ovations . 
  it 's a pr move . 
  slick boys these allies of ours . 
  it 's complicated . 
  the crazy bastards did it !, 
  and mobile internet with the help of a dongle as far as i know . . 
  jokes on them , they will get more than the quota . 
  what sane immigrant wants to end up in romania or bulgaria . 
  no benefits there . . 
  how much ireland stronk ? 
  yeah ? 
  i do n't get it ? 
  i see it more like the german industry is whoring merkel and slaughtering ukraine for some more of those sweet petroleuros . 
  but hey , this is why europe is great !, 
  a diversity of opinions . . 
  and who the fuck is ? 
  imagine all french , german , polish , romanian etc movies translated in all eu languages available on demand . 
  all the music , all the books , all tv shows and much more . . 
  i 'm excited . . 
  data will cost an arm and a leg . . 
  because it 's the lesser evil and because it 's a more advanced form of societal organization , but nobody will babysit ukraine and it 's for the better . 
  the trade agreement and stability will give ukrainians the tools they need to do it themselves , but it will take a decade or two . . 
  if this guy wins the russians are fucked . 
  he looks more bad ass then putin . . 
  how does one stall a tank ? 
  i would look at numbers coming out of belarus with strong skepticism . . 
  democracy , wellfare , peace, 
  gypsies are europeans !, 
  well that will be a hard one to pull because as we speak some states in the eu are trying to embargo products from the occupied territories . . 
  we will probably never become a us style federation in our lifetimes but we 'll creep up ever closer to each other as time passes and we get more and more used to each other . 
  i 'd say in 3-4 decades we will also evolve an european identity . 
  the people who were born before the eu must die first . . 
  i guess if you ca n't make them admire you and respect you . . 
  i think the prime reason they 're doing it is to take advantage of recent introduced government incentives for electric chargers . 
  they could also be prepairing for the launch of their mass market model . 
  there is also an incentive of about 6k euro for those that buy electric cars . 
  and block the western internet . 
  it 's all propaganda anyway . . 
  less likely in the east . 
  riot police is excessively brutal . . 
  wow . 
  first actually piece of gray propaganda i 've seen . 
  indeed it is . . 
  i guess in russia you see death as liberation . . 
  sarcasm does n't help in the face of reality . 
  it took two years to have large percentages of the population believe that most europeans are fascists . 
  and also gay . 
  i guess russians can be brainwashed to believe anything . 
  maybe if china becomes top dog they 'll discover their asian roots . . 
  i guess the trial is over . . 
  the impact the roman empire had on human civilization is unmeasurable . 
  these dudes set standards for millennia . . 
  that 's fucked up !, 
  if russia does that in the immediate future the eu will crash their industries . 
  in the majority of cases they simply ca n't compete . . 
  that shot in the thumbnail is genius !, 
  look who 's talking . . 
  sounds like hungary . . 
  hungary what the fuck ? 
  the masterplan was revealed !, 
  i 'm guess they did n't include romania in the chart as it would have blown out the scale . . 
  wow . 
  we have extensive prescreening for down even in romania . 
  i am amazed by your comment . 
  why is that so ? 
  his act of corruption probably involve these parades in a smaller degree . 
  he made his money with other stuff . 
  municipality contracts , shady real estate affairs , commercial permits and so on . . 
  do you even sarcasm . 
  the pic is shoped . . 
  spend money to make money ... 
  well , if not for the blatant corruption i personally do n't have any problem with all this clownery . 
  if it attracts tourism why not . . 
  mamaia , the current en vogue sea resort on the coast of the black sea is part of constanta , the city where this guy was the mayor . 
  being a frequent traveler to brazil where he owns a house ( probably bought with corruption money ) he had the genius idea that the best way to promote mamaia is to organize carnivals similar to the one in rio . 
  most of the images show him at such carnivals which he hosted . 
  besides that he loved to dress in suits evoking che guevara at political rallies because , i kid you not , he seen himself as a revolutionary fighting the corrupt central administration . . 
  the new vatniks, 
  wait !, 
  where are the commie blocks ? 
  either you die a hero or live long enough to become the villain !, 
  albert einstein, 
  yes , but the influence of the eu precedes the date of ascension . 
  i do n't think we were better off then ukraine and in the republic of moldova life was easier before ceausescu fell . 
  i know first hand . .

  here 's a link describing how event unfolded : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/  she wants the eu commission to charge them big fines $ $ $ . 
  just fyi , that ca n't be done . 
  the migrant quota is n't a treaty , let alone eu law . 
  the council completely fucked up the legal decision making procedure . 
  so the `` big fines '' thing is mostly grandstading , from italy most of the time . 
  i have n't her merkel herself suggest them . 
  but yeah , they would be illegal . 
  i am very emphatic to your post , and mostly agree , but i ca n't agree to this :  this has been shown in the refugee crisis . 
  she 's not just solely running on polls . 
  this was merkel a month before she was told she ca n't send people back to hungary and greece anymore , and polls started showing people wanted to help after the drowned boy photo :  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/16/angela-merkel-comforts-teenage-palestinian-asylum-seeker-germany also on this :  this is bound to look bad and opportunistic but there 's no real good solution for this . 
  start supporting more powers being given to a common institution to make decisions then . 
  stop schauble from suggesting the use of esm to police member state economies . 
  stop supporting the euco system . 
  stop being the sole obstacle to the deposit scheme . 
  there is too much germany has done to give itself the powers , that it now looks like it regrets having . 
  this is hard to express , but a politician is expected to be more than simple conduit of popular will . 
  besides answering to his electorate , he is expected to govern the electorate and to lead the electorate . 
  to balance out what the electorate wants , what it needs , but also to give it direction . 
  a politician that shrugs off that responsibility and starts delivering on public opinion exclusively has traded in his principle for his career . 
  he no longer delivers leadership , direction , initiative or principle . 
  and not needing any of that , more than a few such politicians are found to have spent their careers pocketing favours for themselves when the public was n't looking . 
  private companies have gone bankrupt with such lack-luster , deliver on market data , leadership . 
  entire countries have fallen afoul of it , as those years of getting what you wanted hide the amount of things that you needed that were neglected . 
  it 's the equivalent of keeping an organization on life support . 
  and while germany can afford that now , europe has suffered a lot under it . 
  as the strength of representative democracy is that it allows leadership and expertise to take priority in politics , rather than have the media take it 's place , please do n't discount its importance . 
  national leaders have to take the lead in policy not wait for the public to make it for them . 
  edit :  one of the main selling point of populism is being anti elite and anti establishment . 
  she did not do that all populism has a lot of definitions , unfortunately . 
  everything is an ideology and all non-state approved ideologies must be purged . 
  it 's communism all over again it seems . 
  i dont think ypu realize this , for whatever reason , but for the last century mostof europe has been under facsist or authoritarian goverments . 
  the '' if you ban us you 're weak '' argument might get a rise oit of some meathead , but the honest truth is yeah , facsism tends to win in the short run and ruin in the long . 
  so no , itdoesnt get a fair chance . 
  it gets no chance . 
  you just described hungarians . 
  hell , you just described almost all german and slavic speaking peoples if you date it back to the fall of rome . 
  im pretty sure what pisses you off is that unlike the other dynastic empires this one choose to be of the wrong religious sect . 
  how about accuracy , writing stantards and journalistic ethics . 
  you know the stuff journalismwas made of before we started accusing everyone of bias ? 
  politico has attacked several european figureheads with proper homework done . 
  by comparisonthe telegraph attacks the eu because it admits it wants to attackthe eu . 
  maybe . 
  just maybe . 
  trying tomake things about `` bias '' is actually an attemp at taking attention from a complete lack of standards or quality . 
  thing the express and telegraph lack in spaded . 
  and viruses adapt , does n't make vaccines useless . 
  this law targets those too lazy opportunistic or stupid to get around it . 
  for the `` pin stripe suit '' types there is a different set of lawsthat already caught several political parties . 
  the law is blind and there 's no defence in ignorance . 
  there will be leniency no doubt , but the law is n't there for tourists to flaunt . 
  germany is n't a theme park . 
  ... right . 
  i think you and / u/hawkuk suffer your own bias there . 
  its not about hurting feelings . 
  its about not giving potential neonazies any wiggle room . 
  use of any symbol of the nazi regime is good enough a crime , with the idea that if you that stupid to begin with you 're likely stupid enough to actually try recreating their damn policies . 
  politico is actually quite a good source . 
  something that works . 
  and `` just a free trade zone '' isnt fit for purpose in europe or efta would still be relevant instead of a barnacle on the eu . 
  likely not just one . 
  it 's not likely it even need to be big . 
  the epp dont really card about the eu . 
  for them it 's just anothet way to keeps milking the private sector of favours . 
  they 'd gladly let orban whatever as long as he 's helping one of their corporate friend . 
  i was afraid of this . 
  too many get suckered by self-advertised reputation and a tour of central london , too few have experience with the inner political , the backbenchers , and other `` thick of it '' style incompetence . 
  the european leadership seems not to have the guile to spot an animal thats has puffed itself up and is now wavering . 
  i guess it 's safe to say the uk will have an easy time of negotiation as a result as the eu keeps giving the uk rom to maneuver through it 's typical slothlike reflexes and institutional caution . 
  read the conclusion . 
  any study whocadresses accusations of lack of scientific diligence with `` our study isnt about diligence '' and after go into a rent over their political opinion is only worth wipping your ass with . 
  it 's the some as climate change skepticism and antivax , a lot of eagerness to jncritically believe anything thats looks remotely official without diligence . 
  shame . 
  give it time . 
  bismark said europe does not really exist , thats its just a geographical term at best , but we aim to prove him wrong . 
  thanks for saying as it is : bring born on a piece of land is nothing special unless you made it mean something . 
  damn those thats want european to be relegated to a handfull of dirt and a spot on the map . 
  epp group tend to stick tightly to each other in a way few other groups do .

   when turkey becomes a free and fair democracy only then should the eu even consider starting accession talks . 
  accession talks help a country become a free and fair democracy . 
  i can say this from a country thats has greatly benefited from it . 
  we need to resell an oposite turkey from erdogans . 
  a more prosperous one , a free one . 
  so far weve been failing . 
   turkey is not compatible with european culture any country thats respects democracy , law , and basic human right are compatible with european culture .

  anything below that means we have a lot to grow until we reach a level that is comparable to western europe , or at least countries like the czech republic or poland . 
  their nomadic lifestyle makes it very tough for most countries to integrate them , though the us seems to have been more successful at it ( around 1 million roma live in the us ) . 
  however , the methods the americans used , would be considered too brutal by today 's standards . 
  how does the staff communicate with the prisoners ? 
  also , are n't there problems because of the cultural differences between prisoners and/or staff ? 
  i think the us first needs to reconsider its laws . 
  it has one of , if not the highest number of imprisoned people per capita . 
  many people go to jail in the us for stuff that would only land you a fine , or a suspended sentence at most in european countries , including fucked up ones like russia or belarus . 
  the sentences are also ridiculous , i remember reading on ars technica a couple of days ago that some guy who owned a revenge porn website got 18 years . 
  i mean sure , the guy was an asshole and victims suffered from the humiliation , but fuck , 18 years ? 
  when he 'll get out he will be a hardened criminal , definitely not rehabilitated , so what 's the point ? 
   so you can be 4 and have some sex cuz well you know only for marriage ... nope , you need to be 15 . 
  but if you 're under 15 and the person you are having sex with is less than 3 years older or younger than you , it 's still legal . 
   of course it 's for when you get married . 
  i thought is reasonable enough to assume everyone will be able to understand that . 
  but you said  if she/he is between 18-16 yo they need parental consent so ** the act wo n't be classified as rape . 
  ** that 's simply wrong . 
  if you 're over 15 you can have sex with whoever you want . 
   and i 'm not romanian nor do i try to look smart , do n't need too . 
  :p you live in romania , were probably born in romania , probably speak romanian , so that pretty much makes you romanian . 
  why do n't you actually read the law ? 
  they need parental consent if they want to marry , not have sex , that 's retarded . 
  i do n't know what 's up with romanians , i see this very often , they like to sound smart about something even if they have no idea what they 're talking about . 
  pretty good , without him , things would have looked much different in europe , especially central and eastern europe . 
  not so much a hero , but basically the right man at the right time . 
  yeah , i know , but i was referring to the stare . 
  he looks like he 's on acid . 
  ok , this is fucked up . 
  how can you explain the picture of a malnourished kid , while keeping a positive attitude ? 
   the guidelines for their use is restrictive as hell , it 's more of an intimidation tool . 
  yeah , i know their use is restrictive , but still , why would you trust a monkey with a gun ? 
  they use the same accent when speaking romanian too . 
  however , i do n't get what 's up with the butthurt about the roads , they 're pretty good in my experience , i could even say better than austrian ones . 
  but even norway did n't have this humane prison system until like 1998 . 
  hell , even halden prison was built in 2010 . 
  it 's a new thing , more of an experiment . 
  using the same basis , the us could say they ca n't eliminate the death penalty because `` the american society is more complicated than the european one '' . 
   of the 251 inmates , nearly half are imprisoned for violent crimes like murder , assault or rape ; a third are in for smuggling or selling drugs . 
  nevertheless , violent incidents and even threats are rare , and nearly all take place in unit a. 
  it is the prison 's most restrictive unit , housing inmates who require close psychiatric or medical supervision or who committed crimes that would make them unpopular in units b and c , the prison 's more open `` living '' cell blocks , where the larger population of inmates mixes during the day for work , schooling and therapy programs . 
  [ this is the nyt about the halden prison . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/magazine/the-radical-humaneness-of-norways-halden-prison.html?_r=0 ), 
  lol , in romania it 's the complete opposite . 
  it 's nearly impossible for a regular citizen to buy a lethal weapon for anything other than hunting , sports and collections ( although for the latter i think the weapons must be modified so that they can only shoot blanks ) . 
  even non-lethal weapons , like rubber bullet pistols are heavily restricted ( the police may come at any time at your house to check if you keep the gun in the proper conditions , i.e. 
  locked metal box , outside reach of children ) . 
  police on the other hand are always armed , even local police , who are generally borderline retarded people and receive much less training than regular police . 
  half of gun related in incidents have involved police officers , the other half , the moldovan/transnistrian mafia . 
  i agree most people should n't have easy access to guns , but i believe regular police should n't have access as well , only special forces , like in britain . 
  our former president , a retard , has even suggested police should use their guns more often . 
  thankfully , nobody listened to him . 
  far right is an underestimate ... 
   it would have been suicide if the ukraine nuked russia would have been suicide for russia as well . 
  ukraine , at the beginning of the 90s had one of the largest nuclear stockpiles in the world , also the russian population is concentrated in the western part , it would n't have taken too many nukes to fuck 'em up . 
   you do n't see other countries that do not have a nuke being nuked or threatened . 
  your statement is retarded , look at ukraine right now !, 
  if you look at it the other way , you do n't see anyone invading or threatening nuclear countries . 
  they do n't even threaten north korea . 
  even russia , has mostly threatened eastern eu countries , like the baltics , poland , romania , not nuclear countries . 
  that would be totally retarded . 
  why would they give up their nukes , ukraine gave up their nukes and look at them !, 
  i think more countries should have nukes , like germany , poland , romania . 
  then the russians would probably stop waving their dicks all the time , because the second a russian soldier would set foot into a nato country , they could be sure moscow and st. petersburg would be turned into a radioactive wasteland . 
  the song is `` parazi\u021bii - praf '' , basically a rap song about being high . 
  the chorus is something like :  grab your woman by the ass cheeks , get high and remember  my unorthodox message delivered in a rap rhythm  i 've inhaled a weird smoke , my depressions are gone  i see myself in your eyes , what the fuck , i 'm baked parazitii are some of the most explicit rappers in romania , you can check out [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ergld0_z0 ) , which is partly in english , so you can get a general idea of their style . 
   is the easter bunny a thing bulgaria and the rest of the eastern orthodox world ? 
  it 's a thing in romania . 
  yup , we do this in romania . 
  you can even find wooden eggs which can be used to prank other people . 
  many of us are , but why miss a chance to have some great time with your family , eat some good food and get fucked up ? 
  president makes more than that . 
  he also gets an `` idemnizatie '' ( idk how it 's called in english ) and it 's a lot of money . 
  they do n't use prisoner uniforms in romania . 
   did he know qaddafi went down by having sticks shoved in his arse ? 
  i think he 's going to have something else shoved in his arse while in jail . 
   yeah it is . 
  consent laws are to protect minors so a 17 year old wo n't go to jail for sleeping with 15 or 16 . 
  a 18 year old wo n't go to jail if they have sex with a 16 year old either . 
  we have a 3 year ( 36 months ) limit . 
  if you are 20 + you are going to jail you are wrong . 
  the three year difference applies only if the person in younger than 15 , which is the age of consent . 
  so if a 16 year old has sex with a 14 year old he will not be punished , but if a 20 year old has sex with the same 14 year old , he will be prosecuted , but most likely receive a suspended sentence . 
  if the 20 year old , or a 60 year old for that matter , has sex with someone aged 15 and older , he is n't breaking any law . 
  yeah , pretty sure that 's the case . 
  i remember there was a tv show called romania 's next top model or something like that , they had a bunch of participants under 18 , many posed nude , they did n't have any problems . 
  well , as i said , not exactly naked videos of kids , but teenagers . 
  if he 's into pedophilia , he 'll probably want to look elsewhere , as we would n't be the first foreigner convicted of pedophilia . 
  you 're not taking something into account . 
  romania actually has the largest rural population in relative terms in the entire eu . 
  our urbanization rate stands at 54 % . 
  even bulgaria has like 73 % . 
  this is simply not sustainable on the long term . 
  western european villages are much more developed because they have much fewer villages to take care of . 
   thanks for reminding me how i figured out today that i am probably related to a person responsible for the holocaust . 
  i can never go back to polandball without feeling guilty ... why would you feel guilty about it ? 
  it 's not like you get to choose who your relatives are or have any control over what they did , specially if you were n't even born that day . 
  i never understood the children of nazi war criminals who voluntarily sterilized themselves so they `` would not pass on the blood of monsters '' . 
  implying that somehow evil is passed through blood or genes basically means agreeing with the nazi ideology . 
   adulthood is usually considered to be from the age of 18 or 20 , or 21 . 
  do n't worry , you can still be considered a child , regardless of your biological age , they just use a different term in your case , `` mentally retarded '' .

  they openly perform genital mutilation on young males because of tradition . 
  these are all backwards practices that exist in modern day religions . 
  they are largely ignored even though some of them actually get people killed . 
  people also ignore neo nazy and alt right groups that are increasingly more popular because of xenophobia . 
  they even hate jews . 
  this is literally history repeating itself . 
   however when they 're bringing their problems like crimes , whether poverty or religion based it 's are uneccaptable . 
  these crimes you 're talking about are highly over-rated . 
  the crimes go both ways from non muslims also . 
  they go unreported because people like you want to read about muslims committing crimes . 
   why should n't christians ( well , and non-christians too ) resist now , when the tables have turned ? 
  are you trying to say that muslims are burning and pillaging entire cities to the ground ? 
  there a big difference between resisting foreign cultural influences and outright ostracizing all foreigners . 
  that 's called xenophobia . 
   but welcoming culturally incompatible people with open arms seems like a really counter-intuitive reaction to me i 'm all for immigration policy as long as it respects basic human rights . 
   let those who are willing to do so do what they want , but not drag everyone into this . 
  nobody is dragging you into anything . 
  each country that accepted immigrants did so out of their own accord . 
  germany was more open to the idea , while the uk outright rejects it . 
  germany is actually doing fine . 
  each country chooses its own immigration policy . 
  the problem is that the current wave of populist politicians have weaponized fear and hate towards immigrants because they literally have no plan to improve things in their countries . 
  so they blame it all on immigrants . 
  if this was n't used across centuries by almost all dictatorships , you might be understandably skeptical . 
  but it 's glaringly obvious : immigrants are not to blame for everything . 
  most problems that western countries face today have existed long before the immigrant crisis . 
  people just do n't remember it . 
   so when are the romans coming to invade britain ? 
  it 's not the romans they should be worried about . 
  uk 's problem is fake news powered populism . 
  france and the us have the same problem . 
  that and ww2 era xenophobia . 
   technically if you wan na talk about crusades you have to talk about jihad in iberia and greece and balkans that happened before and during crusades period . 
  this only proves my point that all religions have their own extreme interpretations . 
   anyway crusades happened ~ 600 years ago . 
  exactly . 
  the western world has evolved economically while the middle east is still struggling with severe poverty . 
  these countries are literally governed by jihadist extremists . 
  you are literally condemning entire countries for being poor and uneducated . 
  that 's not cool because some people over there are actually trying to change things . 
  you 're undermining their efforts when you generalize by saying that all muslims are terrorists . 
  this is simply not true . 
  i 'm all for immigration policy , but these stereotypes are n't helping anyone . 
   freedom of movement is the ability of someone in one eu country to move to another permanently without a visa . 
  are you trying to say that freedom of movement was invented by and is exclusive to the eu ? 
  this is not a black and white issue . 
  things vary even within the eu . 
  you ca n't expect to move to waltz in in any eu country and stay there indefinitely . 
  each country has different immigration policies . 
  here 's an [ official eu video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qz4yqm6nxm ) that briefly explains it . 
   ** you can stay in any eu country for up to 3 months . 
  ** if you decide to stay permanently , you need to register as a resident . 
  the requirements differ depending on the country and on the reason for your stay . 
  it 's not all black and white as you claim . 
  also , ceta 's free trade is not the same as eu internal free trade . 
  ceta is a separate deal with canada because canada is not an eu member . 
   i do n't think the u.k. is going to deny eu citizens from temporarily going to the u.k. 
  your opinion is not fact . 
  denying freedom of movement was one of the key reasons of why the uk left the eu . 
   there is a difference between a few criminals who are pretty much despised by the entirety of catholics , and the majority of people in some countries supporting death penalty for what is essentially a thought crime , and you know it . 
  christianity used to burn people alive for witchcraft not that long ago . 
  the middle east has big poverty and education issues . 
  these are directly linked to radical religious views . 
  people should try and help them instead of marginalizing all muslims . 
   they can be easily manipulated by our superior western powers into believing whatever we want them to believe using the magical powers of tolerance and democracy you 're being condescending . 
  this discussion is over . 
   just that it did not mean eu `` freedom of movement '' - a very specific term . 
  true . 
  but canada is not an eu member . 
  it makes no sense to uphold them to the same standards . 
  ceta is a separate deal negotiated between the eu and canada . 
  canada does n't have the same awesome free trade as within the eu . 
  there are various degrees of free trade and free movement . 
  these things are n't just black and white . 
   people from the eu can not stay and work in canada permanently without a visa , unlike with eu `` freedom of movement '' . 
  you ca n't stay in all eu countries permanently . 
  some countries require you to go through various processes and get certain documents . 
  the eu laws are generic and are subject to local immigration policies . 
  you 're generalizing . 
  it 's not all black and white . 
  the catholic church still has problems with pedophile priests . 
  and this happens in modern day western countries . 
  you should n't generalize . 
   remember a thousand years ago ? 
  good times . 
  are you seriously preaching for people to ignore history ? 
  that 's how it ends up repeating itself . 
   many activists that lead those kinds of discussions like ayaan hirsi ali pretty much have to live with fear for the lives forever as soon as they try to promote any kind of modernization . 
  this has n't always been the case . 
  remember the [ iranian revolution ] ( http://www.boredpanda.com/iranian-women-fashion-1970-before-islamic-revolution-iran/ ) ? 
  that happened in the 70s . 
  the middle east used to be more tolerant . 
  but then radical islamist came to power . 
  you 're also forgetting about the millions of muslims that try to fight for change . 
  you 're essentially disregarding their struggle by generalizing . 
  if christianity managed to sort itself out faster , that is not a reason to bully other religions for still having active extreme interpretations . 
  the quran only condones self defense . 
  that 's interpreted by extremists as a holy war against infidels . 
  they are tools for the political ambitions of their leaders . 
  the same thing was true with christianity during the middle ages .

  i also have some friends who went there , they say there were slogans against everyone . 
  not to mention this was sparked by moise guran 's idea of protesting against the whole romanian political class . 
  why is this news and why is it of any interest to anyone ? 
  it 's not like we 'd watch the olympics to see hollande . 
  the protests were agains the whole political class , practically against both the prime minister and the president , which come from rivalling parties . 
  why would they ? 
  they get a lot of money from russia , are under russia 's protection , nothing can happen to them , they have a weird autonomy and lower taxes etc. 
  they also get money from the eu . 
  shit 's going just great for them , why would they care ? 
  where are you living ? 
  are there reglementations to adjust salaries to inflation course ? 
  because here in romania it rarely happens . 
  how come ? 
  salary and debt remain the same , all prices around you go up . 
  you ca n't simply ignore over 20 % of moldovian citizens are ethnic russians . 
  but it 's not about will here . 
  that 's the problem . 
  ukraine is in a fucked up shape and eu does n't really wan na help it . 
  so no matter how much desire they have to get in the eu , if they wan na do what 's best for the country , in these conditions , they will have to say no and play harder until eu finally puts good things on the table . 
  i never understood why ukraine would not be able to play both cards . 
  get great relations with russia while joining the eu commercial zone ? 
  anyhow , russia 's pretty desperate to have ukraine as an ally and in there influence sphere , if ukraine plays that right they are able to gain way more from russia than eu could 've got them on short/med term . 
  probably ... if you can afford it  , do n't think ukraine can right now . 
  beside , they can not simply run from their neighbour , 20 % of ukraine 's population are russians . 
  if your idea is comparing eu to heaven and russia to hell , then it 's way too far fetched for someone to take it seriously . 
  they 're gon na have to trade a part of sovereignty no matter what they choose . 
  that 's in russia 's geopolitical interest , they are not going to give up on that leverage unless a very shitty leader comes or they get something else better in exchange . 
  right . 
  thing is eu wo n't carry dead weight after it , most countries that came in the last decades saw that eu is n't all sugary and unless you have a decent-good economy you will probably only lose . 
  why ? 
  because you 'll no longer have rights to encourage any local production of goods and services , and ukraine ( like romania , bulgaria and a lot more ) can not really compete with germany 's quality/quantity/standards in any way . 
  which means they become a consumer country which in the long term is bad . 
  also , you need to pay your contributions to the eu and the eu funds business is not as easy as it seems ( most recent countries are still failing at them ) so if you can not absorb all that money you 'll be a contributor regardless of your power . 
  for example see this : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_statistics by looking at it , you 'd believe romania is a net receiver . 
  however that is wrong , that 's the budget share assigned ( potential money ) and given romania is n't able to absorb all the eu money , we 're actually a contributor . 
  and that sucks because we have no power to actually contribute , we really can not compare ourselves to germany , france or even poland ( who are doing a great job in absorbing every drop of money given to them ) . 
  and you 'll say that germany is at loss since they are top contributor to the eu , but that is wrong because they are also top exporter . 
  for example , germany exports way more to romania than romania exports to germany . 
  that means a huge flow of money goes on to germany . 
  i do n't have any figures , but my common sense says eu is very profitable for germany and developed countries who actually produce goods and are not consumer countries ( like romania or bulgaria ) . 
  so free trade between ukraine and rest of eu countries will be actually bad for the ukrainean economy . 
  and my personal opinion is that ukraine should take its time and not hurry in any way . 
  they have an enormous leverage they can use on the eu . 
  that helped end the war . 
  you do realize that 's a parody , right ? 
  you tell me , i love it when stuff like this happens on reddit . 
  it 's like a movie but it 's ten times better because it 's spontaneous . 
  actually , it 's pretty easy to get a visa for russia as an eu citizen , there were some tests made by journalists here to see how hard it is to get to russia vs get to the us : american embassy is very guarded with lots of cameras and restrictions and a lot of men wearing guns , access inside is hard and you have to go through a lot of checkpoints before you actually get in . 
  after that they need a couple of days to gather info on you and do a background check , require you a lot of things and ask you a dozen question `` why do you want to visit ? 
  '' , `` do you have any relatives there ? 
  '' , `` what is your religion ? '', 
  it 's hard as fuck to get a visa to visit the us on your own unless you got some connections . 
  russian embassy is only guarded by an electric fence . 
  no checks no nothing , you just go inside . 
  they ask what 's up with you and then proceed to tell you `` sure , you 'll just have to fill these and bring a copy of your id card '' . 
  then they go about telling you how to get there and what to do around , what to be aware of , what to avoid , some cultural things and it 's over . 
  so getting a russian tourist visa is easy ( took about an hour ) while getting a us one is very hard ( you have to wait a lot , background checks , much more documents to fill , a lot of questions asked etc. ) . 
  this experiment was done at their embassies in bucharest , may not be the same everywhere else . 
  no , your only argument is that immigrants are bad and the sole solution you see is stopping the immigration . 
  europe has a negative natural sporus ( i hope that 's what it 's called in english ) and needs some immigration . 
  europe wanted cheap labourers so its residents would have a better life ( cheaper stuff ) , it came with disadvantages . 
  i can not fully disagree with you that europe can not take all the birth surplus from other parts of the globe , but it can take quite a lot , and it has the resources to invest in them to bring them to a higher level . 
  europe needs to figure out policies to increase the birthrate otherwise we 'll be swarmed no matter what . 
  ira was not muslim , era was not either . 
  you came with limited examples , i give you the same . 
  my point was merely that it 's not the nationality but the education that makes the man . 
  crimes are made mostly by people with a low education level ( which leads to low life perspectives etc. ), 
  and in the big group of people with low education immigrants are over represented , because most of them come from areas where it was hard to get any education , where you had to work as a child and barely had what to eat . 
  we see what you mean , the problem is you do n't see , or do n't want to see further , what is causing the problem and what are the solutions . 
  and the biggest problem of all , is most people believe the solution is spending enormous amounts of resources and personal freedoms for security . 
  i fully agree and i believe you 've expressed this point of view much better than me . 
  about as understandable as the actions of the guy hijacking the bus . 
  i guess it all makes sense then , he was n't the bad guy , the immigrants are the bad guys , his acts are totally justifiable . 
  one one side , i agree with you , but on the side of believing in equality and undiscriminating law application , i 'm happy he was treated just like everybody else . 
  kasparov used to be incredibly loved in russia ( afaik ) until he started getting involved in politics , which reduced him to just another politician :( . 
  i 'm not being casual . 
  it 's horrible and disgusting , but there really ca n't be all solved , and such incidents turn people into growing security and surveillance which lead nowhere . 
  not to mention the growing hate on muslims . 
  wait five hundred more years for it . 
  my comment was meant to be a plead against increasing law enforcement and the security machine . 
  it 's impossible to stop them all . 
  the problem is not the fact that they 're muslim ( unless radicals ) but the fact that they have very low education . 
  the state should use resources to bring them up and try to integrate them rather than spend it on surveillance . 
  it 's not going to reduce them . 
  how about that norwegian guy that made a massacre a couple of years ago ? 
  did he immigrate ? 
  can we just stop being so shocked ? 
  these acts can not be stopped , it 's still gon na happen from time to time . 
  it 's not about muslims or terrorism , it 's about loonatics , you can not stop a crazy man . 
  good thing is they happen pretty rare . 
   i think that unite us as ** humans ** , no matter how good things are , we can always complain and whine about how they could be better . 
  fixed it for you . 
  it 's also amazing how imf can get with fucking other countries affairs . 
  demand change from what , change from russian culture ? 
  the elections are legit , there were no real problems with the registration of candidates . 
  but yes , there are a lot of violations and the process of voting is a lot of times fucked up . 
  this happens in most former communist countries a lot . 
  so you believe the presidential elections were skewed and it 's not putin who had the most votes , but the communist leader ? 
   a threat to take one a part of russian territory ? 
  i hope not , that would n't be smart .

  yes , you 're right . 
  if she , or anybody else , would affect the verdict it would be of course very wrong and would deserve to be in the news . 
  until then , this case is just a stupid accusation not unlike the ones we see in tabloids around the world aka `` spoiled kid sue his nanny for not calling his dog sir '' kind of crap . 
  edit : what 's a little annoying , for me at least , is why does she even had to express her opinion about this . 
  it looks like she give it a go to a legal battle that she has no business with . 
  strange . 
  that 's incredible !, 
  never thought the situation is that bad . 
  it 's definitely a disgusting thing :'( i 'll never do that again !, 
  exactly . 
  unfortunately , from what i see this wo n't happen very soon . 
  on the other hand , if we 'll have a free trade agreement we should also have free movement of people , not only one sided freedom of people . 
  that would be bad for our businesses . 
  i disagree , in my case at least that 's not the case . 
  i do n't even have hungarian citizenship . 
  it 's just that we are what we are , hungarian in my case , and i think that if i 've lived in australia i would n't be something else . 
  oh and i live in satu mare  edit : kinda late reply , sorry !, 
  c'mon pops , your still young !, 
  wan na be my dad ? 
  i 'm in need of a cool dad cuz the one i have is colder than the iceberg who sank the titanic :d edit : sorry for the late reply !, 
  lol just saw this hahahahaha :d upvoted !, 
  kinda late , but the gesture counts , 
  in the 70s my mom was born , so i ca n't remember  oh , i 've seen that !, 
  it 's quite nice , really !, 
  some of us trying hard , you do n't giving a fuck ... ... 
  never heard ... sorry . 
  my ethnic background would n't afford me ... :'(, 
  if he participated i want him dead !, 
  in pain !, 
  i absolutely assume my comment and i guess your downvotes . 
  nah , i play handball not basketball , 
  yes , i know . 
  unfortunately anything similar will be probably put on eu 's shoulders ... cuz open borders . 
  trying to figure it out how to have fun staying indoors was my best guess for their hate . 
  but i think you 're more informed than me , about norwegian mind at least , 
  awww : * : *, 
  i did n't tried to get a visa , i 'm not old enough anyway . 
  my source is me , my dad works with un and i was in like ten or eleven us embassies until now . 
  for me it is !, 
  i need that flag and i 'll absolutely ... wait a minute , i wo n't do anything !, 
  : ^ d anyway , without the flag we 'll look like crap . 
  honestly . 
  or embassy workers having a percent of visa rejections . 
  not sure if i dig ya . 
  take a look at your flag . 
  it was a joke ab !, 
  slovakia has `` the euro '' and from what i know they were n't forced to do much . 
  i 'm amazed that you can confuse lenin with walter white having four eyes and two heads !, 
  and wings !, 
  i mean , you 're almost a drone for skanderbeg 's sake !, 
  that 's the red cross flag . 
  stop using those damn glasses / s :p, 
  `` fcuk '' everyone , that 's what europe is and we should n't abandon it only cuz we ca n't please everyone unanimously !, 
  that 's why we go down the drain as a concept . 
  do n't even dare to put your hands on him !, 
  he 's mine !!!, 
  that 's lenin , ya blind-ball !, 
  on years more likely . 
  latvian !, 
  he 's quite cute . 
  i 'll respectfully say hat down master !, 
  :d that guy is moldovan as much as me . 
  exactly this !, 
  could n't say it myself because of lack of english and cos i 'm in between . 
  but this !!, 
  extraordinary !, 
  you 're right !, 
  a young stalin . 
  reminds me about a king , yours or spanish ... ca n't remember !, 
  damn , that gypsy guy is like a spaniard king . 
  tatar is lenin hands down . 
  georgian , armenian and azerbaijani looks like some gypsies i know . 
  moldovan is nothing like a moldovan , except maybe the haircut , it was very fancy here . 
  isis ?!, 
  / s edit : forgot the / s, 
  damn , it could 've been such a success . 
  well , too bad i guess . 
  * i could 've been a mod there , being a woman and not from there and . . * stop dreaming !!, 
  give me your ... ... baggage !, 
  * `` second pair of gloves guys , got a smelly sock here '' !, 
  oh shut up , my bike does n't have wings and my father is n't the most generous in the world : /, 
  it 's me , or more richer one country is its citizens complain more ? 
  that guy/girl was into gypsy beggars and to one point i can understand him/her , they can be very annoying , but from here to condemn an entire country filled with different people than those annoying people , is a trump-long way !, 
  that 's because i 'm hungarian . 
  i 'm romanian citizen and , believe it or not , i quite love this country !, 
  but i am , ethnically speaking , hungarian . 
  from what i know , our country is n't poland . 
  we are a heterogeneous country with lots of ethnic minorities who identify themselves with something else than the official ethnicity . 
  if you 're kind enough to read my posting history you 'll see i do n't have any grudge against our country . 
  i know , 
  can they though ? 
  that 's because i 'm not romanian and trust me , there 's no passion in me when i say it . 
  i , and my extended family ( except two grandparents ) are n't even hungarian citizens . 
  plus one brother served in romanian army in iraq and afghanistan . 
  oh yeah , having russia only one village away from my house would be a thrill ... ... or thrilling . . :d edit : bulgaria ?!? 
  you 're into something funny there russia ? 
  no , really i did n't overreacted !, 
  i usually swear and say stupid things ( get banned from / r/europe etc etc etc and of course etc ) . 
  but you get me right about `` complaining '' hehehe . 
  no worries , it was only a joke !,

  being obese is just as disgusting ( if not more ) as being a smoker . 
  it 's a choice in both cases . 
  shit like - `` it 's an illness '' is just idiotic . 
  sure , some people do have some medical issues which makes them gain more weight , but that 's a minuscule percentage , not 30 % of the fucking planet . 
  apparently , they are already ahead of you . 
   another likely member is turkey . 
  `` today , once again , nazarbaev raised the issue of turkey as a future member , an interesting prospect and not impossible now that turkey 's chances of accession to the eu are diminishing , '' cooper said . 
   another likely member is turkey . 
  `` today , once again , nazarbaev raised the issue of turkey as a future member , an interesting prospect and not impossible now that turkey 's chances of accession to the eu are diminishing , '' cooper said . 
  well , shit . 
  yeah , that 's true , i guess . 
  i meant `` dying '' as a figure/symbol , not literally dying . 
  poland can not into space , but it can into funny . 
  take a look at the comments again , mate . 
  they 're nothing but positive . 
  really ? 
  maybe you 're right . 
  in the '90s in romania there was a flood of american culture and media and nyc stood out the most . 
  maybe the influx of media in the country just balanced out as there are many more sources nowadays and new york does n't stand out as much . 
   maybe tokyo is up there too tokyo is the biggest city and economic center in the world , so i 'd say it 's up there . 
  i get the feeling that new york is dying . 
  when i was growing up , new york seemed to be the city , now it seems to be just a city . 
  i hear about cities like los angeles , london , tokyo , seoul , beijing , moscow , paris etc. 
  much more often than about ny city . 
  am i only imagining it or did you guys also noticed it as well ? 
  anyway , i 'm glad to hear that a european city became the `` dream city '' and overtook new york . 
  to be honest , i think that london would be a better capital for europe . 
  it would also have the bonus effect of stopping the british complaining about not being relevant in the eu . 
  they would find another reason to complain abut the eu most likely . 
  i guess everybody should start using cocaine ... ? 
  i clicked on `` find a job '' button to see what jobs are available . 
  i saw only posts for ceos , managers and senior software developers . 
  wtf is wrong with us ? 
  why are we giving them the best jobs in the country ? 
  joking aside , this is a very cool initiative . 
  often times , i get the feeling that western europeans see romania as being comparable to africa in terms of living standards . 
  having more western immigrants in the country might make people realize that it 's not that bad . 
  i understand your point , but just fyi , japan is still an empire . 
  [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymmdcj7nwz0 ) popped in my mind after reading the post . 
  i have n't heard this song in quite a few years . 
  i do n't expect anyone to know this artist , but it 's funny how i totally forgot about him for a few years and seeing this post reminded me of the song . 
  verhofstadt was my favorite as well , but because i dislike pnl , i did not vote for alde . 
  i was very close to do it though , yet i chose not to at the last moment just because i did not trust pnl . 
  now i 'm quite happy with that decision because i would have kicked myself in the balls if i voted for them . 
  it felt like quite a big thing this time . 
  those are some beautiful pictures . 
   lovely fa\u00e7ade !, 
  even though those were the better years of communism , it still was n't a utopia . 
  influenced , maybe . 
  certainly not dominated . 
  when the queen will start annexing parts of ireland , then rt can call the rolay family nazis . 
  until then , they should keep their head down . 
  well , i 'm quite disappointed . 
  i was expecting you to link me some british comedy show from the 80 's in which that was a punchline or something . 
  is that a reference from somewhere or is it just a reference to communism ? 
   if i said gypsies suck because of their culture , then you 'd have no problem with it ? 
  well , that 's basically what i said in my comment and he agreed with me . 
  i 've also noticed , lately , there are lots of americans around brasov visiting bran , rasnov , sinaia etc. 
  i 'm not from those parts , but i 'm visiting almost each year and i see more and more americans every time i go . 
  it might only be in my imagination , but thats what it seems like . 
  you also forgot bulgarians . 
  there are lots of bulgarian tourists coming here . 
  [ ( at the bottom of the article ) ] ( http://www.ziare.com/stiri/turisti/ins-din-ce-tari-au-venit-cei-mai-multi-turisti-straini-in-romania-1276101 ), 
  gypsies are a sensitive issue all across europe . 
  it 's clear that they are the most unwanted people in europe and i 'm of the opinion that we should play the `` politically correct guys '' and not talk about it . 
  there is a reason why they are unwanted . 
  it 's not like they 've done nothing and people just do n't like them . 
  that being said , only idiots think that they are lesser people . 
  they are not lesser people , they just have shit values . 
  in their community , it does n't matter if you beg or steal , but as long as you manage to buy a gold necklace or a nice car , you 're respected . 
  it does n't even matter if you have no money for food - if you have an iphone , you 're golden in their book . 
  however , you 're cool only if you stole it or if you fooled someone . 
  if you worked for it , you 're a looser . 
  some people might not believe it , but that 's how their society works . 
  so of course that if you grow up with those values , you wo n't be a great man when you 're an adult . 
  but they are certainly not lesser people . 
  there are lots of gypsies that were adopted when the communist orphanages were disbanded in romania . 
  because they had better influences growing up , now they are decent human beings . 
  last week i met a guy just like that on the bus . 
  he was adopted at a very young age , he was very intelligent and he had a degree in law . 
  so what i 'm saying is that i get why people are racist when it comes to gypsies , but you 're an idiot if you really think that you are more evolved than them . 
  their potential is equal to yours or mine , but they 're simply not integrated within the european society . 
  the governments should really work on it because this is a real and very serious problem . 
  you are a funny dude . 
  gosh . 
  might be . 
  i also remember in an episode of qi ( british fact show ) they said that the uk has the smallest houses in terms of size . 
  that seemed a bit fishy to me as well that the report said it 's denmark , not the uk . 
  the link seems to be broke for me as well now . 
  thanks for bringing it up !, 
  me too , brother . 
   * romanian doctors go to poland not really . 
  most go to the uk or ireland or to the nordic countries . 
  it 's a common assumption that romanians migrate to poland or the baltics because it 's better . 
  no one does that . 
  sure , it 's better , but why go to poland and earn a little more when you can go to sweden and earn 4 times the amount that you 'd earn in poland ? 
  there were some talks last year about raising the minimum wage for doctors to 1000 euros by 1 january 2014 . 
  it seems that that idea went to the toilet . 
  they will eventually raise salaries for doctors , but only when it will become a serious crisis . 
  mate .

  this `` political symbolism '' as you call it is n't empty . 
  it 's our own security concerns finding an outlet through finding international guarantors . 
  and that concerns and dependence is n't less real because the integration is ineffective . 
   we 're by far the least likely state to even think about military issues , much less actually using military force . 
  my fear is n't that we 'd be brought into a conflict . 
  we willingly went with the american 's into iraq for nato membership , and we 'd be stupid not to considering what we were dealing with at the time . 
  we 're not shy about such things like the west is , too close to the fire . 
  i 'm afraid that any eventual conflict forced upon us will see the alliance 's currently built being worth shit . 
  both in war and in diplomacy . 
  if they need to maintain the pretense and defend themselves when it fails , that 's a good bedrock for actual standard and objectivity . 
  just because standards can be feigned or bypassed does n't mean they should be binned . 
  it 's no different on the national level . 
  we 're not monolothic nations where everyone agrees and it 's the eu that needs debate and political maneuver . 
  we 're not exploring unknown territory here , we 're just scaling things up . 
  it 's likely a desperate attempt to maintain their tank brigades . 
  it looks good on paper because higher numbers make people happy , just hope it never gets tested . 
   the respective nations retain full political and military command over their own forces . 
  this is my problem . 
  it 's a lie , and it 's a lie told to the daft petty `` sovereigntists '' who like the illusion of independence better than actually thinking about things . 
  necessity and reality will make smaller states become subservient to german command . 
  this is just how things are done , have been done , and will be done when you have such disproportionate power imbalances . 
  we 've done it for the americans , for the russians , for every damn power in history we became a client state of , it 's unsustainable in the end . 
  the europhobes are n't triggered by it because they 're idiots . 
  i 'd like to see a eu army , and can see the many unresolved holes and feigned reassurances given to the histrionic reactionary elements that needs their illusions of '' [ insert country here ] strong independent country who does n't need anyone else , except this one time and we can stop whenever we want , we just do n't really want to '' . 
   if the end result is the entire eu joining the german army , or starting an eu army from scratch . . the end result is the same . 
  a unified eu army , regardless how how they got it . 
  two different things leading in two different paths . 
  one leads to common command structures which gives equal opportunity and political power to each member , both the nations and individuals . 
  the other is a geopolitical pastiche of alliances centered on a separate and detached command , with equally chaotic mutually reliance needing a strong `` central force '' to direct it in the form of the german army . 
  it 's a mess . 
   just last month the eu voted yes on a european union joint military headquarters . 
  except as morgherini keeps saying : it 's not a military headquarters . 
  it 's not even getting extra staff , it 's just getting people from the existing external action service staff . 
  it 's not even called a hq anymore , because that 's the level of compromise involved . 
   saying the eu is not building an army is just ignoring the facts . 
  i 'm sorry but you 're seeing what you want to see . 
  it 's not happening , and it 's a shame . 
  we 're headed in a completely opposite direction . 
  it 's not the same thing.there a proper way to take action together and an improper way . 
  the ad-hoc intergovernmental alliance system is the improper way . 
  no checks and balances , no structural rules , no institutional knowledge . 
  without institutional framework for common decision making , than `` action together '' is impossible even if everyone is outwardly willing . 
  countries do n't even need to agree , they just need to have a structure they can disagree and negotiate in , in an organized manner . 
  it 's a continuation of the politics of hegemony . 
  romanian military acting as an auxiliery force for another seperate command , nominally independent but realistically tied to be virtue of necessity . 
  it also does n't solve any of the major structural , command and communication issues on the continent while giving the outward appearance of security through larger troop numbers . 
  they can call it whatever they like . 
  eu army development presents completely different issues which german army integration does n't tackle . 
  in my opinion this is defense necesity finding a different and exclusive path since the eu army causes many to foam at the mouth at the mention of it . 
  i think we 'll regret it . 
  were going back to the sphere of influence model of europe . 
  the eu and germany are two separate entities . 
  which makes the german army integration extremely worrying since it lacks the needed political integration . 
  i guess the idea that people who read newspaper talk to people who have n't and telling them `` facts '' they read in the newspaper has n't occurred to you ? 
  they do n't need a majority of people . 
  just a significant share of the total media output . 
  the times only comes out looking well compared to the rest of the murdoch media but still favored leave . 
  [ citation ] ( http://uk.businessinsider.com/uk-newspapers-had-dominant-pro-brexit-bias-says-reuters-institute-2016-9 ) do n't know where this `` times supported remain '' bullshit came about . 
  i imagine some brexit supporters were n't happy that not everyone was zealously on their side . 
  some were just cautiously so . 
  there 's no virtue in being `` upfront about it '' . 
  they 're not afraid of getting called out on publishing propaganda , that is not a good thing . 
  lies do n't become any less untrue if you get them of every flavour of the political spectrum . 
   i prefer newspapers to be openly biased and support a candidate . 
  this is how you get the standards of the british media . 
  when you abandon accuracy and objectivity , as hard as it is to achieve , and just start asking about bias . 
  just because the media tend towards bias , does n't mean it should be acceptable . 
  there should always be an expectation of adhering to a journalistic standard . 
  the moment you abandon that , you 're saying that you 're ok with lies and manipulation as long as you can get them in every flavour . 
  this is how we become a punching bag . 
   we were rightfully upset when trump tried to bypass the eu and negotiate with countries individually we should n't be trying to do the same . 
  turnabout is fair play . 
  when a country tries to drag us through realpolitik into dividing ourselves , we do n't only have a duty to mount a response we are obliged to do it better . 
  if they did n't want the attention , they should n't have fished for it . 
  no prolonged media campaign , no `` will they , wo n't they '' ambiguity , no narrative spin applied . 
  this should be a lesson . 
  while this might not turn out to be the best idea , it 's an idea that was quickly and calmly undertaken and that makes all the difference . 
  good vibes . 
  well , you know , there was a reason the uk did so poorly after ww2 . 
  it had shit leardership , out-dated institutions and unrealistic expectations , but they `` won '' the war so they went ahead without looking in the mirror . 
  that 's not the fault of the re-enactment anymore than lyndisfarne glorifies viking raids . 
  that 's not even really the fault of the british , plenty of authors and politicians pointed it out . 
  it 's just history , they were given a poison chalice . 
  admittedly , the glorification of the side-show that was the african front , the empty radio-celebrity that was churchill ( as proven by his second term and his previous career ) , and the disregard for french sacrifices during dunkirk and their scuttling of their fleet involves a lot of willful blindness . 
  so is cyprus , but cyprus is also europe because that 's how we roll . 
  seriously , chill . 
  this is europe , it 's a weird century old convention that does n't have a lot of objective meaning . 
  and turkey is part of the general cluster of european powers and interact with each other , and we all have a significant effect on each other . 
  either become less dogmatic , or at least pick a dogma which is n't so fluid . 
  personally , i think we should n't be taking right/wrong sides on this . 
  the dynamics of the rivalry does n't fit neatly into the western mindset , and apparent and there 's a bit too much realpolitik going around . 
  it 's probably best to well away from this mess , and not deal with any anti-colonialist backlash . 
  although considering our current sa preferentialism in europe , maybe try to normalize our relations with iran to not show any favoritism . 
  or you know , give the middle finger to both iran and sa , that 's also an option . 
  so no , not really ? 
  at least , not under the current administration . 
  `` dad 's army '' effect .

  natural resources are less important nowadays than technology , knowhow ... 
  it wo n't solve structure of their economy , demography ( percentages from each age group is important here not total pop ) , declining of not properly maintained infrastructure .

  they are finally in moldova 's position . 
  that 's why they also agreed to a common border checkpoint where moldavian authorities can check what enters in transnistria . 
  it was opened a few days ago . 
  after 25 years of helping russia undermining chisinau 's authority finally they get it , they know how it feels . 
   a country without a past ca n't have a future literally any country at some point in time . 
  so after 2.5 decades of shiting on romanians and supporting separatists transinistria we should go to war with russia just because russia did to ukraine exactly what it did to moldova with ukraine 's help ?

  depends on why you 're asking, 
  reeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  neah , we 're semi proud of being called vampires , vlad tepes is seen as an ok voievod . 
  for romania you could also use `` i was told this is gypsy country .

  i have bought a couple of scandinavian crimes novels from editura trei , at 13 lei each , but i had no ideea it was this widespread . 
  i ca n't thank you enough for the info !, 
  i know . 
  i try to look out for discounts , but oradea does not have the same variety as bucuresti , or even cluj . 
  also i use the public library , which saves me a lot of money  i 'll have to ask my gf ( a former bookstore employee ) exactly when this happens please do . 
  thanks, 
   so romania has not `` always been a francophone country . '', 
  to be fair , romania is a 19th century creation . 
  there was no `` romania '' before that , but i agree with the general idea that it was not `` always '' francophone  the lack of self reflection or fact-checking is appalling . 
  we 've abandoned history for fantasy . 
  i agree wholeheartedly . 
  on the other hand i_jackoff_twice is really representative for the average romanian opinion . 
   it 's just that since 2007 , a lot of romanians left the country for work , some permanent some not , and if you include those , then the figures change . 
  no they do n't . 
  check out the [ 2002 census ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_romanian_census#18_march_2002_census ) . 
  ethnic percentages are about the same , and that was taken before the mass exodus to western europe . 
  also , out of the population of 3 million missing , some have actually died and not been replaced , as romania has a negative growth in population . 
  also you assume that everybody in the 3 million that is missing is ethnically romanian . 
  newsflash : hungarians emigrated too . 
  as did every other ethnicity . 
   in romania gypsies call themselves gypsies , not rroma wrong . 
  some call themselves gypsies - mostly romanian-speaking roma - , some call themselves roma . 
  their name for themselves in their own language is roma since forever , and it is their right to be called roma if they wish , just as it was our right to ask other people to call us romanians instead of vlachs . 
   it 's only derogatory because politicians made it so . 
  false . 
  languages acquire negative connotations through usage . 
   not learning the official language of the country you live in : lack of integration . 
  it 's just wrong to consider it simply lack of will on their part . 
  some other factors that influence somebody not knowing romanian : - a shitty educational system ( now as well as in the past ) - the fact that some people will not have any context to use romanian , as their low mobility never takes them outside szekler land . 
  as we know , a language not practiced tends to be forgotten also , i take issue with your assesment that `` many hungarians '' fail to learn the official language of romania . 
  they are a a minority . 
  most hungarians know at least basic romanian , that one might need for everyday interaction . 
  source : i have grandparents in szeklerland . 
   a really simple explanation : they probably also tested some roma . 
  roma or people of mixed ancestry who self-declare as romanian . 
   for example , many hungarian from romania decide to live separately and not to integrate ( especially in szekelyland ) . 
  i think you mistake intergration with assimilation . 
  because we might `` tuk eir jerbs '' . 
   the average price of a book in romania is of 19 lei , or around 4.4 euro . 
  i feel that average book prices are around 25-30 lei . 
  at least the ones i usually ( wan na ) buy are in the 20-40 lei price range . 
   the roma situation is more complex than all of them being thieves or people just being xenophobic . 
  a million times this !, 
  thank you !, 
  when the alphabet before the mid 19th century was cyrillic . 
  he 's talking from the 19th century onward . 
  when the language reforms kicked in , a huge number of slavic words were dropped in favor of latin ones , borrowed mainly from the french language . 
  we wanted to assert our latin-ness any way possible . 
  anyway , romania used to have a huge crush on france ( more so than any other eastern european country , except maybe tzarist russia ) , and still does to a smaller extent . 
  there is a difference between  nothing works . 
  and  roma integration never worked on a large scale . 
  one means `` there is no solution '' the other means `` there is no one-size-fits-all solution '' . 
  after joining in 2007 , romania and bulgaria were ( and are ) still subject to employment restrictions in many eu countries . 
   but according to what some romanian redditors said in other threads you ca n't tell apart a romanian from a roma by visual cues alone , you need to take behavior into account . 
  is n't that the case ? 
  something like that . 
  visual cues ( pigmentation , facial structure , etc ) coupled with cues that pertain to social status ( dirty clothes or traditional clothes ) are the most important . 
  but judging who is gypsy and who is not is not an exact science . 
  it even depends on the viewers social and geographic origin . 
   nothing works . 
  bullshit  romania has a population of 22 million , out of which less than 2 % is of other origin , including gypsies . 
  that 's bullshit . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania#demographic_evolution according to provisional data from 2011 census , romania 's population is 19,042,936 . [ ... ], 
  in october 2011 romanians made up 88.6 % of the population . 
  the largest ethnic minorities are the hungarians , who make up 6.5 % of the population and gypsies , who make up 3.2 % of the population . 
  given that a lot of roma do not identify as such , and some estimates put them at around 10 % , the percentage of romanians might actually be lower  it 's sad to see all that crumble , because a group of people are mistakenly considered romanians . 
  somebody mentioned recently that the vast majority of french people do know the distinction between roma and romanian . 
   is the only country in europe to adopt the french constitution actually , romania 's constitution way back in the day was modelled on the belgian one . 
   because this is what forced everyone to call them rroma , rather than gypsies . 
  yeah , how dare they ask others to call them in a non-derogatory fashion ? 
  maybe romanians should start calling themselves vlachs to avoid the confusion . 
  i bet the romanch of switzerland are n't too glad either to have such a similar name to that of the uncivilized romanians from the east . 
  not to mention the citizens of rome or the romagnol of italy ... 
  because : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palestinian_refugees#arab_states  the arab league has instructed its members to deny citizenship to original palestine arab refugees ( or their descendants ) `` to avoid dissolution of their identity and protect their right to return to their homeland '', 
  [ guinea worm ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/18/guinea-worm-second-diseas_n_825239.html ), 
   you are talking about dialects , i 'm talking about languages . 
  that is a political , not a linguistic distinction . 
  the old `` a language is a dialect with an army and a navy '' . 
   but the organisations itself and how they relate to the civil society are not . 
  i beg to differ . 
   please remember that the majority of eu states have never been great nations ( or were such very long time ago ) . 
  they do n't dream of being the kings of the hill , only about securing a nice life for their citizens . 
  you think in national terms , but since people are slowly starting to build european identities , they might feel that france 's or spain 's colonial status was something of the former glory of europe . 
  i 've heard romanians referring to events of western europe in very personal ways out of a shared sense of european-ness . 
   you are mistaking a reason of convenience ( keeping former status ) with necessity of survival ( annexation by neighbours ) annexation by neighbours is not the only threat to one 's survival . 
  a superpower can dominate a smaller country economically just fine . 
  or politically . 
  think about the us 's relation to latin america or how most of eastern europe was n't annexed by the ussr . 
   true , russia is and remains scary for the eastern block , but the eastern block just regained their independence and are probably not in a hurry to lose it completely again . 
  au contraire . 
  i feel that a lot of people in the east have understood that small states get bullied by big ones , no matter how independent . 
  so banding together , preferably with some important western states too seems logical . 
   also please remember that in switzerland decisions like changes in the constitution ( or even normal laws ) are always voted on by the citizens , and never just decided by the ruling governments . 
  this is irrelevant to the discussion as i was not advocating top-down nation-building . 
  i fully support popular consultations when giving up sovereignty is concerned . 
   they , like all unfit parents , should have their children removed by social services . 
  that does n't work either . 
   i imagine large part why it has stayed together is that surrounded by great nations like germany , france , italy etc. 
  the cantons would easily have been annexed if they were n't united . 
  hang together or hang separately , if you would .

  the very paranoid kind, 
   wait this is n't something you can just deny looks like you can, 
  looks like the only 2 in the eu that matter for putin are france and germany and both are more or less supportive of him ( mainly germany ) . 
  no wonder the eu is so weak . 
  -   / r/conspiracy btw moscow has a very tight grip on ngos http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_foreign_agent_law you can imagine it is very difficult for the us to do something, 
  here it 's backgammon, 
   putin 's the top dog , arbiter and strong man that holds it all and he is no immortal so he knows he has to pick someone to follow in his foot steps  i mean he did n't even bother grooming a replacement . 
  maybe it 's for the next phase ( he 's 61 or something , he has time ), 
  it 's not really about the eu 's sanction because then it would try to fuck with other members too it 's because poland is very critical of russia which is not happening in most of the eu  poland has lobbied the european union hard to impose tougher sanctions on moscow , and it is to host elements of a new nato rapid reaction force , created in response to the russian intervention in ukraine . 
  meanwhile http://business.financialpost.com/2014/09/10/poland-looks-to-import-natural-gas-from-united-states-canada/?__lsa=c7b3-8773 germany 's e.on reporting the problem too http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/09/10/ukraine-crisis-gas-poland-idinl5n0rb2ki20140910, 
  they just denied it http://en.ria.ru/world/20140910/192812406/russias-gazprom-denies-reducing-gas-supplies-to-poland.html, 
   think long term . 
  in a couple years putin will be dead of old age or cancer . 
  other chekists will take over and continue the program  the eu and russia however will still be around . 
  and the eu will be a lot different expect to see a lot more orbans, 
   board games which ones ? 
  `` good dictatorship '' very funny, 
  you know nothing about eastern european history, 
  guys , notice how nato is becoming more and more impotent . 
   their opinion on matters pertaining to georgia or ukraine do not hold much sway in american or russian policy circles . 
  yes it does http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/sep/09/every-call-putin-has-made-to-a-world-leader-in-2014 most calls to merkel are from putin and obama it 's mainly countries besides germany and france that do n't matter, 
  the brazil visit was for the world cup, 
   gleb pavlovsky , a political technologist who worked on putin 's election campaigns but has since left the kremlin , told me recently . 
  `` or the idea that ` there is no alternative to putin . ' we invented that . 
  and suddenly there really was no alternative . '' plenty of people are buying that idea even outside russia `` do not do anything about putler because someone worse will take over '', 
  not here most tv viewers here have trust in [ voiculescu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dan_voiculescu ) 's media ( fox/rt level ) even though it is obviously shit the guy even got sent to prison and they think this scumbag is a victim,

  it 's the pitesti - craiova highway , right ? 
   ** and some other things ** like highways tell me we cant build highways with eu money, 
   while it is still a major issue , the people in power are n't spending the funds because their use is monitored and very hard to swindle with yeah they are instead looking to china for money ie 6bn for 2 nuclear plants and some other things, 
  people just do n't like to know that it 's their own fault so * there must be a conspiracy *, 
  what is this ` truth out ' ? 
  they also rely on helping to get those right wing parties in power that favour good relations with them when are the next elections in france ? 
   more hardship for the russians is coming and hardship breeds instability . 
  not unless you 're a dictatorship and can invent and maintain the idea of an enemy to blame things on and go against it will work for a long time then go tits up and later they will do the same again and again and again, 
  no , it does need more resources . 
  it needs more arable land and ukraine got plenty , high quality too . 
  there 's also a lot of gas in the sea area around odessa . 
  it 's officially ours but if novorosia actually happens then they could try to claim it . 
  they also have a lot of interest in the arctic ( iirc they even recently set up a military base ) and it 's because they do have some problems in siberia . 
  they do not have that much oil left ( at least until some they can get some greater technology ) . 
  btw , much of the land in russia is useless . 
  here 's a link straight from russian state media http://english.pravda.ru/business/companies/13-09-2013/125651-russia_oil_crisis-0/ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/11080635/arctic-drilling-is-inevitable-if-we-dont-find-oil-in-the-ice-then-russia-will.html they need to keep expanding and hope prices stay up . . it 's what their government mainly relies on, 
  not too far at all http://imgur.com/cc32pyt til when are you serbs going to defend putin ? 
  not the same thing one is from * private * media * tabloids * and the other is russian * state * media private media especially tabloids do pretty much whatever the fuck they want because they 're private and , you know , tabloids !, 
  meanwhile on the other side it is straight kremlin fed ( dis ) info, 
  it 's actually quite likely to happen so far it looks like we 're heading that way, 
  right now the local rfi, 
   in russian foreign policy , eurasia is a plan for the integration of all the lands from -- you guessed it -- portugal to the bering strait . 
  does he mean this ? 
  yeah , i wonder who will be next to turn like that . 
  maybe bulgaria ? 
   anna arutyunyan , author of the book `` the putin mystique : inside russia 's power cult , '' said the lecture echoed theologically based propaganda from the byzantine empire , primarily the `` godliness '' of the emperor . 
  btw http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third_rome#21st_century, 
  this just shows it does w/e it pleases anyway, 
  does n't the state ( not gdp ) get something like 40 % of it 's budget money from energy business ? 
   war is changing and the type of conflict nato was designed for is n't the type of thing we 're likely to see . 
  nato should check if article 5 can be somehow used against this war without war thing, 
   russia reacts to circumstances , but does not create them . 
   last thing russia created was the second chechen war . 
  you 're contradicting yourself, 
   only when relations with russia are radically improved meaning if chisinau changes it 's foreign policy 180 degrees which is very unlikely . 
  ie no more prowesternism and return to how it was before the best thing would be to just give up on it and let russia enjoy having that little hell hole but they do n't want to have it . 
  not until they take southern ukraine to link with it anyway . 
  the problem is that this might mean losing some votes and help the communists . 
  maltreatment ahahahha minorities here are generally better treated than in most eu countries actually aa new account just for trolling this is my last reply, 
   but since the independence of these regions is recognized by russia bullshit russia does not recognise transnistria officially  since the inhabitants will most likely not be interested in reunificatio it 's possible if russia backs out of this and/or those people like how moldova develops after integrating more in the eu, 
   i remember 6 years ago there was a commission formed by european countries which declared it 's all georgians ' fault , so rufed had to invade them . 
  got a link ? 
   is there anything eu is going to do to help moldova and georgia to repel invasions of russian federation disguised as protection in ethnic conflicts ? 
  i doubt it will do much . 
  especially if it 's about the already separatist regions . 
   even his choise not to participate in any debates reminds me of our pm he said he wo n't do that ( presidential elections coming very soon ) and it 's probably because he 's afraid of fucking up live on tv he has a big chance to win, 
  they are looking to see if they really are useful too maybe some see the reactions and alliances as weak, 
  yes but jayrate was talking about hitler and nazis, 
  if you guys decline then it is proof that you are fascists . 
  hmm i got a question does anybody know how russian media treats this subject ? 
  all that 's really missing is genocide, 
  he wants a coup but you have to take out all the core fsb and siloviki too or they will spawn another putin later, 
  did n't lenin try ? 
  i 'm glad more westerners ( apparently mainly the dutch so far though ) are starting to see it the way it really is . 
  lots of kremlinbots, 
  yeah he said that just during his visit in the us . 
  he wanted to make himself look good . 
  biden wants us to recognise it and the president disagrees . 
  last year the pm said romania will recognise it after there will be a new president ( he hopes to be him ) because the current one does n't want to . 
  i 'm ok with not recognising it . 
  yeah the russian church has very strong ties with the politicians keep in mind that the new eurasian idelogy is heavily based on orthodoxy, 
  yeah it 's a couple centuries old, 
  . . no u mean the one in deveselu , right ? 
  again some are random picks, 
  react by banning more imports directly from eu so middlemen firms in belarus make more money . 
  it 's really not enough and by ties i meant cultural , historical ones . 
  it was a genuine question, 
  they miss being invaded ?

  i did actually , it was a really good speech i thought . 
   and therefore the scottish citizens are eu citizens and have been following eu law for decades already . 
  scots were citizens of the eu only as far as they were citizens of the uk , once that stops being true , so is their eu citizenship . 
   what `` danger '' ? 
  the scots have been eu citizens for so long already . 
  throwing them out and causing a bureaucratic mess and economic disruption , that would be dangerously irresponsible . 
  it 's not a backdoor either , because everything will have been negotiated and agreed upon beforehand . 
  no , it wo n't be negotiated beforehand , you truly have no fucking clue about international politics do you ? 
  the idea that scotland would negotiate its accession to the eu from within , was a nonstarter as far as any eu member state , only the snp peddled such blatant lies . 
  that was never true , nor did it have any chance of being true . 
   besides , we 've had a much worse precedent in the form of east germany joining west germany . 
  really , do you prefer that a scottish village declares itself independent pro forma , jumps through the administrative hoops you want them to jump through , and then the rest of scotland joins them when that 's finished ? 
  i think you 'll find such an exercise to be anything but a `` pro forma '' , like i said you have no fucking clue . 
  do you actually think an independent scottish village would be let into the eu and than it would annex the rest of scotland and tadah !, 
  are you out of your fucking mind ? 
   now we 're closer to the truth . 
  it 's in no way dangerous , it 's politically unconvenient for some political parties in some other member states . 
  it 's not for political parties , it 's dangerous for nation states , the same nation states that you need to convince not to veto you . 
  such a backdoor of the accession process would simply not be accepted by the other eu members . 
   not at all , since it hinges on the permission and cooperation of the original entity . 
  with that condition diehard unionists can stubbornly keep their regions in their cage for as long as they wish . 
  until they 're fed up enough to be willing to bear a couple years outside the eu , of course . 
  they can bear as many years outside the eu as they want , who stopped them ? 
   it is the fact that the president is n't elected directly by the people . 
  this is the exact reason that president is n't elected by majority vote . 
  the reason the us system is the way it is , is because it was developed a fuckton years ago , and it was considered back than that logistically it would be much more difficult to have a direct election , as such they created the elector system . 
  the us system is nothing more than a relic from a time passed , not some revolutionary way of electing leaders . 
  as a matter of fact all current eu members are democracies , but only some of them are republics . 
  the us does not have a monopoly on the term republic . 
  also see the fucking [ definition ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/republic ) . 
  no , scotland is n't a member of the eu , the uk is a member of the eu . 
  the idea that scotland would get `` continued '' membership to the eu once independent is not only against the current treaties of the eu , but it 's an incredibly dangerous precedent of backdooring the accession process , a precedent that many countries do n't want to see happen . 
  as such the idea of `` continued '' membership would be met with a very brief , but firm veto from several eu members . 
  because in that case the ruk would be on the hook for any debts iscotland had . 
  additionally it would force the ruk to give iscotland voting right in the board of the bank of england , as such there might come a time that ruk and iscotland monetary policy would diverge , which would create severe problems . 
  see the eurozone crises for some examples of what those problems might be . 
   well , the point of it is that it is n't a democracy . 
  it is a republic . 
  holy shit , i had a better opinion of you . 
  the usa is a democratic republic , in the same fashion that france is a democratic republic . 
  the idea that the usa is a `` republic '' and not a `` democracy '' is nonsensical . 
  a republic just means that the head of state , in the usa 's case that 's the president is elected , unlike a monarchy where the king or queen is a hereditary title . 
  the uk for example is a also a democracy , but it 's not a republic , it 's a monarchy . 
   continued eu membership deal . 
  lol `` continued '' , is that myth still present ? 
  they 'd have to join the eu first and than at least 2 years of monetary stability before moving to the euro is even a possibility . 
   that is kind of a key distinction , no ? 
  mobs are n't big fans of procedure . 
  on the other hand , elections are pretty much pure mob rule . 
   hell , in the usa , there have been presidents elected that actually had less people vote for them . 
  if i were you i would n't use the usa 's elector dysfunction to brag . 
  the fact that presidents were elected while receiving less votes than their opponents is not something to be proud of , nor is it `` democracy '' . 
   democracy is n't mob rule either . 
  well , actually ... yes it is . 
  in very direct ways it is mob rule , it 's just that in most democracies there are mechanisms that prevent the majority from exploiting the minority . 
   they cant really deal in absolutes . 
  what an absurd notion , in the matter of what currency you are going to use after independence there is no middle ground really . 
  london said quite clearly that there will be no currency union . 
  as such the option left for snp were quite few , make a new currency pegged to the pound , make a new currency and float it , use the pound without a currency union or use the euro without being in the eurozone . 
  the snp failed to give an answer either way . 
  not everything is relative . 
   yes but then again , the number of people in glasgow who voted yes is larger than the number of people in edinburgh who voted no . 
  what an absurd metric , you 're really pulling at straws now . 
  also by the way the difference is actually only 141 votes , which seeing as glasgow has about 100k more population is nothing . 
  so even your absurd argument is actually no argument . 
   but by pointing this out in your argument you seem to imply that those who did n't go vote in glasgow thus belong to the no side . 
  in effect that is what they did , since pro-independence was much stronger in glasgow , every person that did n't vote from there was an indirect vote for the status quo . 
  that 's how democracy works most of the time , every election almost half the country is upset , why should this be any different ? 
  did i miss a memo that said it was westminster 's job to do the snp any favors ? 
   the point is , i do n't think you can blame snp for acting the way they did . 
  you absolutely can , it 's not london 's job to do the snp 's job . 
  that said i would argue that london has n't made it clear about the currency , from what i know they were pretty clear that there would be no currency union with iscotland . 
  that 's as far as london can take it on that issue . 
  technically true , however turnout was higher in edinburgh and the no vote won by a much larger % than yes won in glasgow . 
  so even though there were 50k more overall voters in glasgow , the yes vote only won by 25k votes , while in edinburgh the no vote won by some 70k . 
  results for edinburgh just came in , no won with 61 % . 
  stick a fork in it . 
   i think currency was the key uncertainty absolutely , the idea that ruk would give iscotland a currency union was always fantasy land , which left the question of what they 'll do , and the snp failed to answer that because they knew if they told the truth it would hurt their position . 
   but hopefully it gives the spanish government some confidence to allow the referendum in catalonia . 
  lol , yeah that 's going to happen . 
  it 's probably dead for at least 20-25 years , that said i expect that the national government wo n't underestimate the scots next time , i think the scottish nationalists will have a much harder time getting london to accept and recognize a new referendum . 
  pretty much as expected ; from what i 've seen the snp failed time and time again to answer questions about what would happen after independence , all they said is that `` it 's going to work out '' and that scotland will be one of the richest countries in the world . 
  glad to see that scots recognize the utter bullshit peddled here . 
  i would say that ever before that russia was different from other european powers at that time , and while it 's true that the tsars were much more western , they were the only ones . 
  quite a few times russian tsars tried to pull russia culturally west and failed . 
  even if what you say were true however , it still would n't mean i am wrong , just because russian `` uneuropeanness '' might be a historically new phenomenon , does not make it any less true . 
   substantial part of population share european values clearly not substantial enough , which means that a bigger/most of the population does not share european values , i do n't see where i was wrong . 
  i never claimed that every single russian citizen does n't share european values , just that taken as a whole russia does not have a european culture . 
   europe is not what it used to be i think you mistake russia with europe . 
  russia is only partially in europe and even there just geographically . 
  i do n't think it 's wrong to say that russia has never been culturally european , they themselves claim this . 
  if scotland wo n't take their share of the debt they wo n't get ** any ** of the assets either , and i do n't just mean those from the boe . 
  the idea that scotland wo n't take their debt is like a sheep and two wolves voting on what to have for dinner . 
  the rouble is toast this should rhyme , but it does not !, 
  english is at fault . 
  ... haiku anyone ? 
  it dropped about 15 % since the crises started and what 's worse is that the fall is probably not over yet . 
  that 's an interesting question , one which assumes there is a russian manufacturing . 
  italian is in first place followed by french and greek fighting for second . 
  very nice .

  ** ** you are the worst leader ** . 
   and we are willing to get paid less . 
  this is the main , if not the only reason , german industry has moved east , to some extent . 
  but they have little or no intention of raising wages or quality of life in the east to be on the same level as the west , because they enjoy both the workers coming from here , as well as the workers who live here . 
  you 're right , we might not have the capacity to get them to do it , and even if we all threaten to leave the free-market as a block we might only get a few concessions ... 
  still , as the entire world economy slows down , it is becoming increasingly likely that germany will have an export crisis ; if you take a look around the world , can you point to any region which could buy their products in the volume that they produce them ? 
  so in order to export , they 'll need to lower the end price of their products , which means that even if they have a massive crisis and unemployment in their country , we 'll be ok since they need the cheap parts . 
  it is at this point that i hope poland ( v4 ) will replace germany as the * de facto * political and ideological leader of europe ; because having a self-hating leader is detrimental to us all . 
  i am responding to someone who brought up ~ ~ refugees ~ ~ illegal immigrants , in a thread about public debt . 
  i am perfectly willing to share the `` refugee '' risks and costs with germany and all other eu countries , as long as the solution is not to let in millions of illegal immigrants , but to build safe-zones , defend them and donate construction materials and equipment so they can rebuild their lives in their own country and culture . 
  instead germany is spending 50 billion euros on just 1 million , out of the 10 million syrian refugees and donating another 3bln to turkey . 
  that is absurd and it only goes to show that merkel does not care about the well-being of these poor people . 
  she is helping only the ones who risk their lives at sea and pay 1-5000 euro to people smugglers / human traffickers because she wants more cheap workers . 
  all the deaths at sea , are on her ; blood on her hands . 
  how absurd is it that germany when confronted with population decline , does n't move its ' industry to countries where europeans are either unemployed or underpaid , but instead brings in illegal immigrants . 
  if ever there was a sign that the eu is not now and not ever going to be a federal state , this is it . 
  this is how german leaders think . 
  they do n't want a unified europe , they do n't want prosperity and a good life for europeans , they want powerful german corporations with an open market to sell to everyone . 
  that 's it . 
  if you do n't share risks , then every single crisis we 're going to have , starting with the sovereign debts crisis , the crisis in ukraine , the `` refugee '' crisis and any other that 's coming our way in the coming years , is going to tear the eu apart , bit by bit . 
  and if you think otherwise , you have no understanding how states are formed . 
  edit : whether you like it or not , you need some level of european nationalism , because sooner or later there will wars ; wars are inevitable and when push comes to shove if a spaniard feels no reason to fight alongside a pole , or a romanian feels no reason to fight alongside a frenchman in mali for example , then we do n't have a federal state . 
  we have nothing . 
  and so far , germans were not willing to join the french in mali , particularly because they are so weak and think they can solve everything with * sanctions * . 
  well you ca n't ; sometimes you need a military and you need to use it . 
  it is becoming increasingly evident that germans do n't want a federal state with equal prosperity for all its ' people but instead want to continue to have a strong germany at the center of a free-market . 
  thus , the sooner germany has a crisis and steps down as eu leader , hopefully replaced by poland , the better . 
   is designed to prevent any form of risk-sharing between euro-area countries and to confine the costs of fiscal and financial instability primarily within the more fragile countries . 
  more steps towards the death of the eu . 
  idiotic german leaders ... if peoples do n't share a common fate and common risks , we 'll never have a federal europe . 
  being part of a united europe ** has ** to mean that all its ' citizens are subject not only to the same rewards but also to the same risks . 
  whether it 's financial risks or geopolitical / military risks . 
  in other words , the eu would be turning more and more into a sterile mechanism for countries to act in their own interest , within the same union . 
  if that 's the case then we need to abolish the eu parliament since it 's nothing more than a massive drain on resources . 
   in the end it 's not like a country with not even half the gdp of belgium is going to cause much headache . 
  everyone east of germany , austria and italy feels the same my dear friend . 
  everyone . 
  if we threaten to leave , we 'll do it as a block . 
   it 's not as if former dutch truck drivers are happy with all the romanians here . 
  yet another reason why your government does n't want eastern europe to develop and pay decent wages to * truck drivers * here for example . 
  call me whatever you want , you seem a little delusional or have a bit of a messiah complex . 
  kind of person not willing to stay in a free-trade union with countries who export so much it hurts the development of my region ? 
  you bet i am . 
  just like you 're the kind of person who feels like you owe us nothing when in fact some things are so unfair only fiscal redistribution can make them fair again . 
  such as there being a single job market for doctors , and public systems of very rich and very poor countries competing for hiring doctors on the same market . 
  that is fucking absurd , when the romanian tax payer is placed in competition for medical services with the dutch tax payer . 
  but sure , you keep thinking that i 'm the one who is not virtuous enough to be in this shit union . 
  then we 'll exit the eu as soon as you cut funds . 
  you owe us plenty , both morally and economically since we 're in a free trade zone with countries who produce and export literally everything . 
  otherwise how do you suppose we can becomr `` competitive '' when we neighter have the capital , nor the tax on imports to protect local businesses from western products ? 
  honestly , in the face of western stupidity , as an atheist / anti-theist , i am ready to become a religious conservative if that 's what it takes to stop this madness . 
  ideological views , of course . 
  think about it , we 're in a union with mammoth industrial countries who , when faced with population decline choose to import millions of new people , instead of sharing their industry with unemployed and underpaid europeans . 
  let 's make a deal with the us if they 'll build something over here . 
  edit : i mean , just think about about it , germany is going to spend 50 bln euros , this year and the next just for the immigrants they have taken last year . 
  with that kind of money you : 1 . 
  use 5-10 bln to secure the european borders / coasts . 
  donate 10 bln to turkey , 10 to other countries near syria housing refugees . 
  you 're still left with 20 bln euros to develop infrastructure in europe . 
  with 20 bln in aid for some 10 mln displaced syrians that comes to about 10 000 euro / family consisting of 5 syrians , 2 parents and 3 children . 
  is n't that mind-boggling ? 
  instead germany is spending billions for housing , feeding , clothing , policing , etc. . . for people whom 70 % are n't even syrians but come from africa , afghanistan and pakistan , and other countries . 
  then merkel comes on tv and says that `` refugees have to go back when the war is over '' ... mostly north africans , pakistanis and afghans have to go back when the war in syria is over ? 
  what the hell is wrong with this woman ? 
  you almost say that as if it 's a bad thing ... 
  when western and northern europeans wo n't share their industry with unemployed and underpaid southern and eastern europeans , of course you 're going to look for a better deal . 
  not really , airbus planes are already built all across western europe and they 're still profitable . 
  also , bombardier do a good job of that ; opening factories where governments offer them large contracts . 
  i doubt they would continuously do it if it was n't profitable . 
  look it up . 
  what poland is saying to western europe is , * share the industry * . 
  germany does n't need more workers to supplement the population decline , it needs to move its ' factories around and give jobs to ** europeans ** of whom we 've got plenty either unemployed ( 20-25 % , 46 % among young europeans in some countries ) or poorly paid ( eastern europe ) . 
  i can promise they 're not staying in eastern europe . 
  hope your wish comes true . 
  excellent . 
  you take them all . 
  edit : lol , wait what ? 
  are you a misogynist / sexist ? 
  if that 's the case in your country and men are more attractive for employers your new guests will feel right at home , i 'm sure . 
  5 of 6 pictures showing women and children . 
  fine !, 
  for the love of god , take women and children then but keep single men out . 
  germans , still struggling with acquiring a sense of humor . 
  the search continues . 
   but just imagine it without them . 
  why would i do that ? 
  am i a moron ? 
  you are defending the proposal by completely taking out of context . 
  i am not an idiot to not see what you are doing . 
  no , not all germans are weaklings , but in general , german society has become one made up of weaklings and you have no business being a leader , when you hate yourselves . 
  last time i checked neither the chinese nor the japanese had an assimilation and integration problem into european culture and way of life . 
  my dear german friend , imagine that i 'm about to speak very slowly : what you need to understand is that those of us in the east have no more patience to be lead by such a culture of weaklings and pushovers that the germans have become . 
  over the next few years weigh your words and your actions very carefully if you still want to have a european union which goes further than the german - polish border . 
  edit : not everything is about money , in this increasingly disgusting world we live in . 
  please do n't waste your time threatening to cut eu funds or telling me that we 'll never be as rich as you ; that might not be the case , but you might eventually be as poor as us . 
  honestly , the sooner the germans step aside and let poland lead , the better . 
  hopefully the upcoming exports crisis will do just that . 
  assimilating the local population into the culture of immigrants ... what will german scientists think of next !, 
  oh , come on , do we seriously even need to teach german anymore ? 
  so few people speak it anyway it 's not really an international language .

the plague must be kept in western europe, 
  well , gee , i wonder what gymnast we had that did a perfect 10 score, 
  oh yeah , that 's a hospital indeed . 
  but it does n't represent the current reality , that is 100 % a picture from the late 1990 's / early 2000 's , before we were in the eu . 
  romania was literally a 3 ` rd world country back then , people have no clue how much we improved since then, 
  did n't you say you left the sub ? 
  why you still posting ? 
  already changed your mind ? 
  that 's quick, 
  that you 're whining like a bitch, 
  since 2007 all universities i know of have renovated their dorms . 
  ofc , there 's still a lot of beds in rooms , but no way there 's any walls falling apart , rats or cockroaches . 
  also equipped kitchens , laundry-rooms , and nice , clean bathrooms . 
  tell me what hospital that is , from where . 
  come on , if you 're gon na post that kinda shit then i expect you to at least give info . 
  or let me guess , is that a random picture from 2001 you found on google ? 
  prolly some picture from the early 2000 's . 
  i 've seen this kind of shit a lot of time , romanians bitching while using old pictures that do n't show the reality, 
  what dorms have you been in ? 
  think he meant in the eu, 
  good wine , alright people , managed to reform their country quite well . 
  so you 're pretty much like us imo , so you guys are alright, 
  well , that sucks, 
  the details do n't matter , it is a state with a more powerful army than moldova , and that can successfully defend itself from it 's ex-country . 
  that 's all you need to be called an opposing state . 
  if transnistria wanted , i think it could invade the rest of moldova if nobody else intervened ( even russia ) . 
  i was n't thinking about the army . 
  border police maybe ? 
  i mean , fuck 's sake , they are letting armed police-men of transnistria just go past without caring a bit ? 
  very well actually , they 're the only country we trust enough that they 'll be a good ally in good or bad situations . 
  what the fuck are the moldovan authorities doing ? 
  sleeping ? 
  how the hell can they just let forces of an opposing state freely pass through the border and do whatever they want ? 
   genetic sewer hitler called , he said hi, 
  this is very serious . 
  if this shit will keep continuing , the european public will react , as is normal . 
  and thus nationalistic/far right parties will start getting popularity/be formed . 
  the migrants will eventually be kicked out , but at the same time a lot of other things will happen . 
  the migrants wo n't let themselves be kicked out easily , and the eu will be in danger to fall apart once such parties have power . 
  and a europe that 's not united anymore , with nationalists in power , is not something to be optimistic about . 
  and ? 
  germany seems to love it 's immigrants , so we are just helping them take them in . 
  i 'm sure you see enough shit on the streets there in india , no need to talk about other parts . 
  btw do you clean your keyboard of shit that remains from your wiping hand , or do you use just one hand ? 
  haha , so funny !, 
  xddd, 
  rather give it to us . 
  we 're buying f-16 's so we 'll already be used to western planes by then, 
  when you say shit like the media being corrupted by perverted old men , it would mean he would have some sort of influential position in the media to be able to corrupt it . 
  he does n't, 
   of course he has , why would he be in the spotlight ? 
  because he 's an ex-football star ? 
  what kind of a question is that, 
  considering how much rape is in sweden , naah, 
  what the fuck are you on about ? 
  this thing that happened is a one-time thing on that channel , that show is quite tame . 
  it 's just inviting stars and asking them questions about all kinds of shit , and they have to eliminate blondes by calling out which of them answered wrong . 
  it just happened that this old guy that is living off his past glory as a goalkeeper during our national football team 's golden days , found a fan in this show , and he managed to get her to show him her tits . 
  yes , he 's a perv , he always was , and he probably even banged her after the show . 
  but this does n't mean , our media is `` corrupt and monopolized by those perverted old men '' , like what the fuck you talking about ? 
  he has nothing to do with the media . 
  if i remember right adevarul shat on the rapists all the time in their articles , that ai n't something bad if you ask me, 
  why the hell are you talking about the media as a whole ? 
  that certain thing you talked about revealing her was all maruta 's show fault . 
  and his show does retarded shit all the damn time . 
  only after that there was no point in hiding her identity anymore , so all the other media outlets used her identity . 
   but for this case it involves gross perverted old men , which obviously shows that the media in romania is highly corrupt and monopolized by those perverted old men . 
  what ? 
  i really like when swedes try to talk like they have any clue about other countries . 
  they always say retarded shit, 
  i honestly do n't know . 
  i guess union is a solution , but that would be detrimental to romania . 
  so no thnx . 
  i personally think moldova is a failed state and it will never be able to reform . 
  it 's fully controlled by oligarchs and shady individuals . 
  so no , if they 'll ever want to do such a heist again , they will . 
  prolly will try to be more subtle about it , but they 'll escape scot-free again . 
  hah , they 're long gone, 
  and the average moldovan guy will still think russia is better , even though all they do is give them sanctions, 
  we ca n't let any random immigrant pass freely through our country . 
  we invested so much in our border security ( which seems to matter jack-shit for schengen ) for this purpose .

  yeah , makes sense . 
  good ? 
  there 's nothing much to talk about this news, 
  uh , no ? 
  do you even know what schengen is ? 
  what do gypsies have to do with schengen genius ? 
  haha , good .

  fucking lol , they wasted so much fuel to crush those 3 frozen chicken, 
  itt : romanians whining about the oh-so-poor doctors, 
  well , eastern europeans generally looking better than brits . 
  so , yeah , no surprise . 
  it 's the kids that are rating themselves happy , not adults . 
  also what the fuck does being beautiful have to do with a kid being happy ?

  good old european tradition . 
  it 's about time the nordic got in on the action . 
  some people think of rome , some think of church latin . 
  it 's best not to make assumptions and latin , as someone point it out , has varied too much over the ages to be overly precise about it . 
  just leave it be . 
   to romance people especially , the ts sound has become rather universal interpretation of c-vowel combo . 
  trying to undo it at this point seems like it would be more confusing than helpful . 
  what 's a little bit of land between old friends ? 
  no , someone in power just a agreed with you . 
  he does n't seemed to have proposed any actual plan . 
  just because someone agrees with you does n't mean they know what they 're doing or what they 're saying is possible . 
  same goes for information on the side of buses . 
   so far nobody has made a convincing argument that the practical problems could be overcome . 
  they likely still have n't . 
  likely new poll numbers have come in , and this is the immediate response . 
  the actual `` getting the idea of the shape of the possibility of a workable plan ready '' can wait after the election . 
  edit : downvoting the guy for questioning if there is actually a plan in place instead of empty rethoric , really ? 
  what are you , brexiters ? 
  but airbus does n't negotiate their supply chains by national quotas . 
  neither do they negotiate their employment number by national quotas . 
  the esa has to do both . 
  the thing about a federation is that it 's not supposed to be just `` a union '' . 
  but instead partially hierarchical with a completely new entity at the top : a federal government . 
  and the federal government , optimally , is supposed to be an entity independent of it 's constituent members and strong enough to make sure the strongest member do n't bully the weaker ones . 
  this ideal is n't always reached but it 's the design principle , and often missed by those that think `` biggest member takes all '' . but this ideal has managed to become very true in every modern federation that stays true to the word . 
  now about the sanctions , let me tell you that they ca n't be done . 
  it 's blustering . 
  the entire migrant matter : the borders , the policies , the negotiations , even the quotas were done ** outside ** the eu . 
  yes , you heard me . 
  try to find the law on euro-lex , does n't exist . 
  that 's because the heads of goverment have consistently avoided eu aparatus for decision making since 2008 . 
  and because of this they ca n't use the eu to impose sanctions for things that are not eu law , because the migrant quota is not eu law . 
  now about yugoslavia . 
  it 's telling that the old yugo republic function very well , especially compared to the rest of the east until one moment : the sanu memorandum . 
  a bunch of nationalistic serbs who interpreted yugoslavia acting as a union as : weaking the serbs people , and then proceeded to help destroy it for the good of greater serbia . 
  this is not the fault of yugoslavia , but because ethno-nationalists can not imagine anyone else having any other reason for doing things but ethno-nationalism . 
  and it is n't the first time serbs got it wrong , j\u00e1nos damjanich who helped anti-royalist hungarian revolutionaries was considered a traitor and a self-hating serb simply for not joining the rest of the serb elite on the royalist side , him being a liberal . 
  lastly , let 's face the truth of not federalizing : we will return to the old circles of influence . 
  actual hegemonies . 
  because as we see in the eurogroup and schengen , when we have inter-govermental g7 style negotiations germany comes out on top . 
  before that , in the 70s , it was france with degaul wanting a intergovernmental europe and enforcing the luxemburg compromise . 
  a non-federal europe is the wet-dream of those that want their own `` sanu memorandum '' moment of dominating the union . 
  does n't matter how it started , it 's no longer a french company . 
  instead now airbus is the continental company with subsidiaries and manufacturing centers around the continent and the world . 
  we need to think more like airbus and arianespace in how we do things . 
  we manage to survive and build top notch technology because instead of doing a `` black arrow '' and giving up completely we double down and pushed through and carved our own sector of the market . 
  and that 's why we still have airbus competing toe to toe with boeing , instead of several competing national companies begging it for contract work . 
  you forgot what brought you to this point . 
  it was n't magical european flair , it was dedication to persist and to work together . 
   i 'm not sure how useful it is to compare esa and spacex . 
  in the end , it is politically possible to spend european tax money on space tech right now . 
  that is done , and comes with some big compromises on where that money is spent . 
   if that money results in a rocket program that is somewhat commercially competitive on the global satellite market , it only is competitive because tax payers subsidised it in the beginning anyway . 
  if there is political consensus to have a satellite program , spacex will simply get out-subsidised . 
  if not , fine . 
  nasa did n't have to deal with the same problems esa deals with today , and spacex still out-competed them big time . 
  horrendous costs in the public sector are nothing unique to the eu . 
  to begin with , you misunderstand how digirism works . 
  we do n't have infinite amount of funds to prop up the esa if it starts loosing contracts . 
  because we would n't just be paying to r&d but for every launch we choose it over a cheaper option . 
  dirigism works by relying on the market to balance out your original costs to get you as close to a net balance if not surplus . 
  this is the system that the french have used since degaul for they arms and aerospace industries and it works . 
  by comparison the uk has , before thatcher , gone completely nationalize and subsidize and it 's been a costly failure , marred by immense cost and noncompetitive industries that largely failed to enter the market . 
  so , in short , the dirigism way is to subsidize products you can be confident will start selling after you sunk in the starter cost . 
  so it never becomes a burden , while maintaining competitive practices . 
   of course there are other options . 
  strengthening the private sector to have a eu-spacex fully vertically integrated in paris or stuttgart could be one option . 
  doing that on eu money is politically impossible right now , there would need to be a french/german elon musk for that to kick-start . 
  this is very , well , uneuropean . 
  simply put , it 's a very economic liberal way of thinking that does n't match either dirigism or ordo-liberalism ways of europe . 
  europe , at least continental europe does n't just `` leave it to the private sector '' . 
  we do n't fully nationalize either . 
  or wait for `` elon mush '' to kick start things . 
  the esa itself was a product of academics urging political movement , not bureaucrats , generals or millionaire . 
  and any future move will be similar . 
   the other option for having a european high tech industry would be to further increase specialisation . 
  competing with spacex is almost impossible unsubsidised , so do n't . 
  stimulate developments in the private sector , have the world leader in antenna tech in paris , gas generator fuel pumps in stuttgart , satellite power supplies in barcelona , ect . 
  - mission accomplished when even spacex ca n't get around buying there . 
  i think you 're giving way too much credit to spacex . 
  it looks like you caught the `` private always better than public '' bug . 
  but every single infrastructure work you see around you is public sector work , or atleast public sector organized/funded . 
  simply put , we do n't need to do things like the americans to compete . 
  here market economy has a different meaning , a different history . 
  the shock therapy of thatcherism and eastern europe was our lesson in `` laisez faire '' , do n't do it . 
  edit : btw , arianespace which provides esa with rockets is the first commercial space company in the world . 
  it 's also another good example of how dirigism works . 
  considering the amount of slavic , hungarian , turkish and german words in romanian , she 's quite a different kind of lady . 
  and the philae blunder was caused by failure of landing thrusters built by a dutch company . 
  people do n't realize how bad the current system is to actually building something . 
  we just need 1 company to completely fuck it up , and since we need 1 company for every component ( slight exaggeration ) it 's only a matter of time . 
  the uk shot themselves in the foot in 1971 when they cancelled the black arrow project in favour of buying stuff from the americans . 
  they 've since been dumping money into skylon for a long ass time , pretending that something might come of it . 
  but by and large , uk aerospace has been on the decline . 
  bae , their workhorse has since had to create a completely seperate entity in the us ( firewalled from the rest of the company ) to maintain profits , and they still get slapped by the us government when they try to sell or do service support overseas . 
  the french took the other path and teamed up with germany to create the esa and maintain some domestic industry . 
   so spacex will come and produce this wonderfully amazing exceptional rocket that will put everybody out of business ... 
  okay ... it 's not like onlye europe will suffer ... so will american companies . 
  and either way that 's life . 
   we 'll find other projects to work on and move on .

  i bet the turkish names are more familiar ( they make the news each year since we have a small turkish + tatar muslim comunity ) . 
   i read in a newspaper once that there is a new anti-corruption force in romania that uncovers a lot of dirt , but that some politicians remain almost untouched and continue their careers despite convictions of corruption . 
  [ probably this ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1qga99/romanias_anticorruption_agency_keeps_taking_down/ )  it is because the agency is seen as political herself partially ( but that still does n't mean people think the convicted are innocent ) . 
  but most people just have short memories / do n't actually give that much of a fuck . 
   or the prolonged arm of the eu meddling in local affairs . 
  actually , most people [ trust ] ( http://adevarul.ro/news/politica/adevarul-despre-romania-sondaj-doar-348-romani-mai-incredere-guvernul-ponta-1_52558850c7b855ff561b1947/index.html ) the eu more than national institutions . 
  well , they will probably appeal , then appeal again and hopefully , get a final conviction from the supreme court . 
  then they will do time , and after that , idk . 
  maybe return to politics ... or not , who knows . 
  they were out of the game for a while now anyway .

  not sure if this is the case , but i do n't think we should respond in a putinesque manner , tbh . 
   i guess there is some truth in the stories i see europeans telling about gypsies . 
  any good stereotype has some truth at its heart ( roma and criminality , jews and banking , you name it ) . 
  it 's just a formulation of a complex issue in a simplistic generalizing way that 's the problem here . 
  thanks for the answer . 
   i believe the title is in hungarian and is about norway it 's `` gypsies in norway '', 
   so romas will forever be referred to as romanians but they wo n't be the only ones being referred to as `` romanians '' , so you equating the two will still be wrong . 
  because , you know , ethnic romanians are capable of crime too , and will get lumped together within those statistics . 
  afaik , urban poverty correlates with higher levels of criminality than rural poverty in other , more homogenous countries as well . 
  that might be a factor . 
  found this study om a quick google search : http://udini.proquest.com/view/rurality-and-crime-identifying-and-pqid:1981309941/ relevant bit  * while there is a large body of research examining crime in urban areas , far less attention has been given to rural crime . 
  there is reason to expect rural crime to be different from that in urban areas ; rural and urban places differ on a variety of characteristics -- demographic , economic , structural , and social -- that are known to be correlated with crime . 
  unfortunately , there have been relatively few systematic examinations of rural-urban differences in crime rates . 
  although they are few , existing studies show a fairly consistent pattern ; urban areas generally have higher crime rates than do rural areas , supporting the assertion that there are important differences between rural and urban places . 
  findings of lower rural crime rates date back to the beginning of the 20 ^ th century * [ sic ! ], 
  * ( see krohn , lanza-kaduce , and akers 1984 ) , when researchers were concerned with the effects of urbanization and suggested that urban areas fostered crime . 
  research consistently found that urban places have higher crime rates than rural places , as shown in quinney ` s ( 1966 ) study using national data from the uniform crime reports ( ucr ) on offenses known to police ( from 1960 - 1961 ) . 
   poverty in france [ 1 ] found [ a nice little blogpost with maps about crime in france ] ( http://meridianes.org/2012/12/09/cartographie-de-la-criminalite-en-france/ ) . 
  i 'll let others judge how well it correlates with your map . 
  now you have to prove that virtually all of those romanian nationals were of roma ethnicity . 
  roma - an ethnicity romanian - an ethnicity , but also a citizenship ( aka nationality ) so a roma from romania will be referred to as `` romanian '' because they are citizens of romania , and newspapers usually refer to citizenship , rather then ethnicity . 
  that 's why `` morrocan '' is often used , but `` berber '' quite seldom . 
  that still does n't mean that all `` romanian crime '' is exclusively roma , or that ethnic roma all come from romania , or that the two ethnicities are the same , or whatever point / u/neredev is trying to make . 
   ukrainian facist/nationalists have been using the same symbol for 20-30 years , same symbol as serbian nationalists ?

   this would include potentially-hidden assets if they are hidden then they are not included in sanctions . 
  or the other way around . 
  if they are included in sanctions and require compensation does n't this mean that they are already public ? 
  they can change their vote in next elections . 
  so if we will decide to sanction all russians will this mean that russian state will be left without money ?

   there is no hard evidence yet . 
  you need an investigation for that .

  i think you meant monetary policy, 
  i agree that we talked too much about this particular subject . 
  so this is my last post about romania 's admission in schengen in this thread . 
   unrelated topic disagree . 
  is the prefect example what other countries can experience later . 
  willing , able ( meeting requirements ) but not let in because `` reasons '' . 
  this is the biggest danger that could break eu apart and some countries ( some of them in the core of the eu ) proved that they are willing to have this behavior for internal ( political ) reasons . 
  i would argue that will all those exceptions that uk had you guys implemented a de facto multi-speed . 
  it was n't my intention to complain about romania 's case . 
  i was trying to make a point that pandora 's box is already opened about preventing countries to join a `` greater speed '' even though they are willing and able to join simply by will of political decision . 
  is not ( only ) silly , is worse , is a precedent . 
  they say that any country willing and able will be free to join whatever they have going on in their inner circle . 
  romania 's case with schengen proves that is not the case . 
  issues that are at best remotely connected to schengen and not described in conditions for admision . 
  meanwhile some schengen countries can not even secure their borders which i guess should be the most important condition ), 
  it was decided in the negotiations that romania will be part of schengen . 
  we spent 1 billion euros to secure borders , met all technical criteria and some countries still say no after they invented conditions not specified in the documents about schengen . 
  what makes you think that they will not do the same for any `` enhanced cooperation '' subject ? 
  they got one . 
  is called cyprus . 
   every eu member is free to join same with schengen ( actually schengen is mandatory for romania ) . 
  and still romania is not allowed to join even though it meets all the criteria specified in documents .

  belarus is mini russia, 
   might want to read how ussr worked russians dominated political life in moscow . 
  when romanians from basarabia were deported in siberia russian were placed instead . 
  same in the baltics . 
  is called ethnic cleansing and russian conquest . 
   well . 
  russian empire lost the war and ceased to exist . 
  ussr was never considered a legal successor of russian empire . 
  really ? 
  is this your logic for not returning what belongs to romanian people . 
  thanks for proving that regular russian has a thief mentality . 
  also if russia in not responsible than why it agreed to create a commission to study the details of the treasure transfer . 
   seriously ?

  no , it 's not . 
  greece lied about existing loans in order to get more . 
  [ greek government-debt crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_government-debt_crisis )  the greek crisis started in late 2009 , triggered by the turmoil of the great recession , structural weaknesses in the greek economy , and revelations that ** previous data on government debt levels and deficits had been undercounted by the greek government ** . 
  ...  but to get on topic , do you think a proposal on changing the eurozone is a bad idea ? 
  change can be both good and bad . 
  bailouts have been almost always a bad idea since they do n't fix the symptoms of the problem . 
  but , yes , things can always be improved . 
  this needs to happen gradually after lots of deliberation and experimentation . 
  quick and risky changes rarely pay out . 
   these seem good numbers but they got out of the slump much faster than the eurozone did and as a whole i think they have a more robust economy . 
  printing money did n't fix their problems . 
  millions of americans literally lost their homes in 2008 . 
  this did n't happen in the eu . 
  the crisis was more mild in the eu compared to the us just because most of eu trade happens in euro and not us dollars . 
   it 's great the eurozone is growing but that does n't mean it did the right decisions . 
  so the eurozone economy is growing because it made bad decisions ? 
  really ? 
   it made a blunder and should have been out of the crisis sooner . 
  so the 2008 crisis happened because of the eurozone ? 
  really ? 
   so what i am saying is , yes , the eurozone is doing better but it took far too long and hurt too many people in doing so . 
  you 're complaining that the eu took too long to fix a problem that the us created . 
  just let that sink in . 
   anticrisis budget is n't a bailout fund go read how america or canada work america and canada are not part of the eu . 
  they are not unions like the eu . 
  you 're comparing two different things . 
   you 're the nationalist one complaining about the single market not me . 
  where have i done this ? 
  i 'm actually a big supporter of the single market and the eu . 
  what i do n't like is special treatment . 
  that 's what spain is asking for . 
   if i want romanian workers or indians i will just ask them to come here and i do n't have to pay their government that 's not how the eu works . 
  if you do n't like this , then you can leave . 
   you 're strawmanning since i never said i 'm against financial aid to eastern europe then why are you complaining about the money that romania gets ? 
   given that you defend germany having all the benefits and none of the responsibility . 
  where have i said this ? 
  i have n't said anything like this . 
  germany pays its dues just like everyone else . 
  the only one officially complaining is the uk . 
  your opinion is not the official opinion of your country , but , yes , you personally are doing just that . 
  every country recovered at its own pace . 
  that 's past tense meaning they recovered . 
  europe 's economy is growing . 
  the only exceptions are spain and greece . 
  even spain is growing , but slower . 
  greece is an `` up and down '' scenario . 
  they grow for a while , ask for another bailout , then fall down again . 
  nobody enjoys this . 
  i actually like greece a lot . 
  i 've been there as a tourist and i will go again . 
   ah , that 's the thing , you 're afraid of stop being such a big leech . 
  you 're complaining about the responsibility of being in the eu while enjoying the same benefits as everyone else . 
  countries like the uk benefit heavily from cheap labor from eastern europe while complaining about the help these countries get from the eu . 
  ** you ca n't have all the benefits without any of the responsibility . 
   in the uk england hands out money to the rest of the union due to it being the richer part is n't the eu supposed to be about an ever closer union ? 
  the uk profits heavily from cheap labor from eastern europe while always pointing the finger at these countries for the help they receive from the eu . 
  ** you ca n't have all the benefits without any of the responsibility . 
  ** the recent failing brexit negotiations are living proof of this . 
   yes they have systemic problems that have nothing to do with euro that put them in this mess in the first place . 
  thank you . 
  this was my point all along . 
  people always ignore this when they blame the eu and euro for all their internal problems . 
   the romanian government is the largest employeer in the country that 's true for most western countries as well . 
  you have now gone completely besides the point . 
   i 'm saying that the eurozone as a whole took longer to get out of the crisis than the us . 
  first of all , the 2008 crisis started in the us . 
  it took a while for it to reach all eurozone countries . 
  during that time things were already being `` fixed '' in the us . 
  there 's also this . 
  [ eurozone economy quietly outshines the us ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/0bbc026a-ea12-11e6-967b-c88452263daf ) you 're literally complaining that this took longer than you expected . 
  stability and predictability are actually good things . 
  nobody likes fast changing economies because change can go two ways . 
   you also made up the part about bailouts , that 's not what a investment budget is for . 
  i did n't make it up . 
  it 's right there in the article . 
   spain , on the contrary , wants deep reforms that will lead to more than just a shared currency : in this future scenario , member states will share an ** anti-crisis budget ** ...  romania also gets access to the western european markets which have a way higher purchasing capacity . 
  everyone in the eu does , regardless if they have the euro or not . 
  this is not special treatment . 
   the single market facilitates migration but if any country needs romanian labor it can have it without the need to grant you access to their markets . 
  exactly . 
  you want cheap labor , but you do n't want to help the countries of those people that work for cheap . 
  that 's not how the eu works . 
  ** you want all the benefits , but little or none of the responsibility . 
  ** you 're complaining about the responsibility while quietly ignoring all the benefits . 
   yes , but the eurozone , because of how it was designed could n't fix the crisis and move on . 
  so the eurozone is made up of only spain and greece ? 
  really ? 
  why are you ignoring every single country that has the euro and has recovered ? 
  you 're literally generalizing based on 2 isolated examples . 
  spain and greece had problems long before they switched to the euro and long before the 2008 crisis . 
  why do people always forget this ? 
  because it 's easier to blame others for your own problems . 
   they could use that money to fix some eurozone countries that could n't recover as fast as they could thanks to the currency you mean how germany , italy , france and pretty much every other euro zone country recovered despite having the euro ? 
  inflating your own currency only creates more problems . 
  printing money only creates more problems . 
   meanwhile there are some countries that receive 3-4 times more than they contribute , like romania , and they feel with the right to tell us to do n't ask for money . 
  spain is asking for a bail-out fund for failing country economies . 
  you 're comparing two different things . 
  romania does n't have a failing economy . 
  it 's growing .

  if you read the article , you are of lower use to them if you are out of eu . 
  which is why your relationship will sour if you leave the eu . 
  is n't it funny how that plays out ? 
  again , that `` so did you fallacy '' . 
  yes , we were . 
  because that 's what we needed to do to get into nato . 
  what 's your excuse ? 
   like i said that 's still a terrible reason the arguments being ... what ? 
  that so did others ? 
  if somebody steals money from a store it does n't mean he is n't a thief just because other people also stole . 
  source ? 
  sure , how about the us immunity from prosecution in the international war crimes tribunal ? 
  do you want to know who bullied other un security council members to vote yes on that exemption ? 
  your dear representative . 
  it was exactly , but exactly the same scenario which played with out with the intervention in iraq and blocking the anti-war resolution . 
  so your diplomats fought like lions to get us special status while not getting the same for your own forces . 
  yeah , that 's totally not how a puppet behaves . 
  it is n't a single war , it 's multiple . 
  you did n't gained anything by doing it other than a pat on the head . 
  more importantly , your voting record in eu matters has been , in a large number of cases , to the interests of us and not to the interests of your own population . 
  so yeah , bullshit !, 
   if your statement were true why would n't they go by plane because most of them are not refugees . 
  most of them are economic migrants from safe countries . 
  to give you an example : brazil has opened several asylum registration in the turkey and lebanon camps for syrians . 
  there are virtually no questions asked when approving the request . 
  those accepted receive a one-way free plane ticket to brazil . 
  do you care to guess how many takers they had ? 
  less than 2000 since 2013 ( the data i got was from september ) . 
  out of the `` millions '' fleeing death there are less than 2000 people who took the offer to go to a country which is one continent and one ocean away from said conflict . 
   well the cost of a return ticket is negligible compared to the costs of figuring out if someone is eligible or not do you care to guess how many of those found not to be eligible are actually sent home ? 
  less than 10 % . 
  merkel 's unilateral suspension of the dublin agreement generated a few hundreds of thousands from the middle east and west asia starting their trek towards and through europe . 
  yes , some were already here , but a large number started after that . 
  what do you think the statement `` free plane tickets to europe , no questions asked '' will generate . 
  we are struggling now , with less than 1 million . 
  how do you think we will do with the 3 or 4 enticed by your very generous idea ? 
  i am sick and tired of this guilt tripping . 
  most are not fleeing war . 
  another good fraction are in jordan and turkey so they are safe . 
  it is their decision to get on a boat and , worst , to take their children on a boat that leads to death . 
  theirs and theirs alone !, 
  the major news outlets around europe have a big big problem . 
  there are a few generations that grew up repeatedly catching them with very big lies . 
  there are a few generations which grew up knowing that the news outlets are not to be trusted . 
  lack of trust = lack of power to sell on products or ideas . 
  i see bad times coming for them in about 5-10 years when said generations will reach economical power . 
   that any airline will simply refuse to let these people board without papers !!!!, 
  they refuse to let these people board without papers !, 
  if they are from syria they can fly , no issues . 
  this however , does not answer my question : what is the solution ? 
  setup free flights for whomever , where-ever they want to go just on say-so ? 
  so is 50 % of this planet . 
  that does not equal certain death ... 
  i am so tired of this shit ... it 's not europe 's fault that a number a people choose to ignore absolutely everything , get in dingies and try to cross the mediterranean . 
  so at this stage i 'd like to ask the op what is the solution to this behavior ? 
   given the great challenge to our country because of the strong influx of refugees but i though germany can surely deal with 500,000 refugees/year for years to come , [ in the words of the same sigmar gabriel ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/08/germany-500000-refugees-a-year-clashes-lesbos ) just ... 2 months ago . 
  so ... where 's the challenge ? 
  thanks , i was looking for that post . 
  i guess our friendly neighborhood censor decided it was anti-immigrant and removed it . 
   islam l'alternative well , he is right about that one . 
  islam is essentially the alternative to 80 % europe might consider founding values . 
   to people who flee certain death give shelter yes , but apparently the only places they feel safe are germany and sweden . 
  should we take that preference into account ? 
  turkey is not certain death . 
  albania is not certain death ( about 10 % of the current wave ) . 
  pakistan is not certain death . 
  bangladesh is not certain death . 
  nigeria is not certain death . 
  ghana is not certain death . 
  ethiopia is not certain death . 
  just sayin ', 
  actually both me and others here gave you multiple examples and evidence which you dismissed using the `` so did others '' falacy . 
  because that is how mature people react , bravo you mature mature boy !, 
  watching you be all butt-hurt , huffing and puffing at people and bitching has been very entertaining, 
  dude , you 're living proof that a sense of humor is a terrible thing not to have, 
  well , your prime minister is known for getting drunk and high and fucking a pig ... and yet the majority voted for him ... 
  so you are not totally clueless , who would have thought . 
  now think about this : it 's a video of 2002 . 
  a guy , waaaaay back in 2002 though you were being us ' lapdog ( true , not puppet ) . 
  yet to this day you still find it surprising that so many more think the same way . 
  i did n't write the song . 
  a british guy did !, 
  [ there 's even a song featuring said reality which bugs you so badly ] ( https://youtu.be/abhzq_vrbsq?t=2m4s ), 
  the thing is even reading the article the title does n't make sense ... 
  mate , you have close to 100,000 people living in tents with winter approaching . 
  there are more hundreds of thousands struggling to get there currently roaming around europe ( and they will in the next few months ) . 
  to talk nothing of those who are still roaming around europe . 
  most of these are still unprocessed . 
  a large portion of them will end up being rejected for asylum , but not actually deported , which means swallowing the ranks of the illegal workers and of the desperately poor . 
  they have a volatile cultural background with close to no ability to handle frustration . 
  this will , in turn , increase crime rates , rioting risks , radicalization , etc. 
  a good number of those accepted will , in turn , bring in dependents . 
  this means extra pressure on the welfare , school and medical systems . 
  for those still outside germany , there is a system put in place called forced redistribution . 
  the forcing is both for the countries accepting them and for the migrants who desperately do n't want to go there . 
  apparently , schultz is now bitching that the eu money for migrants are running out and that especially the eastern european countries are asked to contribute more . 
  some of those are dirt poor by european standard are now expected to fork over money . 
  is there a definition of `` handling it '' which means `` totally failed '' ? 
  a close relationship is directly proportional with your usefulness for them . 
  getting out of the eu thus out of anything that might influence the game diminishes that usefulness .

  [ you mean like healthcare ? 
  ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=romanian+hospital&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=999&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewivjjca2uxkahvlcswkhrlvbpkq_auibigb ) [ or infrastrcture ? 
  ] ( http://media.rtv.net/image/201208/full/harta_autostrazi_romania_34849300.jpg ), 
  we 're trying to save europe ( or at the very least save ourselves ) from your culturally self-destructive , non-militaristic ways . 
  peace and prosperity are not perpetual ; soft-power and sanctions ca n't solve all problems . 
   qmv and yet we can at least block things like immigrant quotas . 
   that said i think it would be a lot easier to create a real union if you split europe up simply because then yourelminiate a lot of the inequality . 
  the east is not interested in your 2 speed europe concept . 
  read my other comments and you 'll understand where i 'm coming from so i do n't need to repeat myself . 
  lately i 've been seeing and hearing things from austria ... why would they be in this if the eu is working ? 
  after all it is nothing more and nothing less than a parallel structure entirely inside the eu which otherwise would n't be needed . 
  it 's not as if serbia , moldova or ukraine were there so we could claim that this new entity has some purpose outside the eu . 
  no , this is specifically set up so these countries could achieve something , inside the eu , which they could n't otherwise . 
  what will that be ... time will tell . 
  i meant that jokingly :d, 
  nobody is asking you to ditch anything . 
  but when it comes to defence from putin , you have a better chance with us . 
  i think austria is a little pissed at germany in this context . 
  i think they tried to impose some sanity through backchannels and it did n't work with merkel and their participation in this is a bit of a middle-finger . 
  because in all honesty , if you had a working eu , such a thing would n't be needed . 
  would it ? 
  there must be a rift in side the eu which is not obvious . 
  under normal circumstances , yes , germany-france ca n't be toppled , but there are other factors at play . 
  france is beginning to have more and more internal problems due to the failed integration of its immigrants . 
  germany is likely to have a crippling exports crisis as russia , opec , south america , china , and others , all slow down and ca n't buy german goods anymore . 
  poland is about to become the spoiled brat of the us in the region since it is willing to build a military , while germany is n't . 
  i 'm not saying this will succeed , i 'm just saying that this is what i see happening ; but i for one welcome our new polish overlords . 
  intermarium is needed because the west does not take serious the military defence of europe as you all have a geographical location and international relations where you 're not worried by anything or anyone . 
  the countries in intermarium are between russia , turkey and the west . 
  thus , the only long term defence solution is for us to become too much trouble to invade . 
  and yes , this is also about conservative politics because the eu under franco-german leadership is becoming too culturally self-destructive , not unlike the ussr . 
  when it comes to voting in the eu , these countries will be joined by others . 
  uk , italy , greece , etc. 
  this is an attempt by poland ( v4 ) to replace germany as the `` leader '' of the eu and introduce more conservative internal and more aggressive external policies . 
  edit : and quite honestly , v4/poland is the leader we need because for many prosperity has run dry . 
  every time i heard george friedman talk about how the eu is founded on the promise of peace and prosperity and how that ca n't last , i did n't take him seriously because i did n't think anyone would be dumb enough to base a federal state on that , on perpetual growth and lots of money ... 
  but the more i talk with westerners here it becomes apparent that that 's how they understand the eu ... which is unreliable really because peace and prosperity are not perpetual . 
  we need to reform the ideological base of the eu ; we need more nationalism ( patriotism same as us ) which in turn can become european nationalism and we can rebase the eu on that . 
  and we need this for several reasons : 1 . 
  so we stay the fuck united next time we have a crisis , either political , economical or defence/military . 
  so we can justify military spending at the eu level ; all the shit we 're going through now would n't be , if we had a military as powerful as the us . 
  so we can have a solid core of values and the determination to impose them on any immigrants who move here so that the integration and long term assimilation process works . 
  to turn soft power into hard power when need be . 
  actually , it 's because we ultimately need the west that we first need each other . 
  we just need a stronger voice in the eu before we 're taken seriously . 
  i think in the end , we still all need each other , it 's just a matter of how we get there . 
  hey , you do n't need to tell me that , tell it to the germans ... we 'd already be spending 2 % on defence if not for their deficit rules ... 
  it 's happening !, 
  we have the same in romania !, 
  what cheaper countries ? 
  if you look at the map you quickly find that it is almost impossible for greece to protect that insane shoreline . 
  at first i thought that maybe they did n't want to , but it 's physically a difficult job and they do n't have the resources . 
  the key to stopping the flow is turkey . 
  turkey recently ruined its ' bilateral relation with russia ( probably at the request of the us ) which means that it is dependent on the rest of us at this point . 
  can it have a relation with the us and not with us ? 
  sure . 
  can the us afford to have europe and turkey at odds with each other ? 
  probably not . 
  but , open google maps and look at the map . 
  what happens when germany has had its ' fill of immigrants ? 
  we already know the eu is n't functioning properly ... that means that borders will close in a panic , from germany , austria , slovenia , croatia , serbia , macedonia , and then greece is fucked . 
  if greece is fucked they 're going to bring their navy about , catch all immigrant boats and take them to the shore of turkey , to dump them back . 
  turkey is going to scream that it 's territory is invaded by greece , and either one fires first , we will have an armed conflict between the greek navy and the turkish navy . 
  if you look at their equipment , they 're actually quite balanced powers in the air and on the sea . 
  on land turkey can destroy greece , but it could not do that because its ' east is fucked . 
  russia will arm the high number of kurds in the south-east of turkey just like they did in ukraine and then turkey would be fighting on two fronts . 
  plus , russia would absolutely love an armed conflict between 2 nato members . 
  the above is the worst-case scenario . 
  ___ the best-case scenario is exactly what merkel is trying to do now , pay turkey some money , ask them to stop the flow in exchange for visa-free travel to europe , etc. 
  but erdogan does n't give a shit about 3 bln euro or about free travel for turks in the eu . 
  which is why he 's not going to stop the migration , he 's going to extort the eu for more money since turkey is a real regional power while european countries have reduced themselves to a bunch of pussies . 
  ___ the next stage is the most important one . 
  does merkel have the determination to threaten turkey with sanctions and can sanctions be hurtful enough to make erdogan stop ? 
  if not , then we go to scenarion # 1 and it all spirals out of control until the us intervenes to calm everyone the fuck down . 
  ___ edit : russia is going to continue to bomb the shit out of syria and possibly even try to destabilize more regions ; they do n't care about isis , or syrians ; putin cares a little about assad because dictators tend to support each other , but it 's not about that . 
  putin ( really the fsb ) wants to put pressure on nato , any way that they can . 
  in ukraine , they took crimea and created 2 unstable regions and are now playing the long economy game . 
  their actions in syria are meant to put pressure on turkey , support secessionists kurds in the long-run and perhaps , what i said above about having greece and turkey fight or germany putting sanctions on turkey . 
  either one is great for russia . 
  ** and what 's the cause of all this ? 
  ** * europe is not a military power capable of projecting force in its ' neighborhood . 
  the topic of my comment is the relation we enjoy with the us , not your economy . 
  the us does n't want a european federal state because that would be an entity strong enough that it could have the luxury to choose its ' foreign policy instead of following their lead . 
  by keeping all of us friendly but divided , they ensure they do n't have to deal with that . 
  but , i think they are very unhappy with germany and other western countries ' lack of contribution on the military front and poland , who is willing to militarize , will probably become the spoiled brat of the us . 
  when that happens and you suddenly find that your overseas exports are entirely at the whim of the us ... you will have wished you built europe up sooner but it might be too late . 
  that 's more or less where i was going with this comment . 
  economy crises are n't that fatalistic . 
  :p look what happened to japan in 95 ' http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zytwa6lwok4/td7lonuaudi/aaaaaaaaa3g/ueblh_bk7ri/s1600/japan-gdp-historic.png the same is about to happen to china , but in the same way that japan is still there , china will be there too . 
  if you need someone to catch you when you fall , the reasonable thing to do is to help us develop enough that we can do that . 
  but , you 're right in that i think we have a very serious problem ; germany ca n't raise internal consumption with a declining population but due to automation exports are n't slowing down either . 
  bringing in a million new people will raise your internal consumption , but if you fail to integrate them into the work-force it will be trouble in the long-run . 
  watch this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gg1rfa_qek you need a country with a strong identity if you 're going to assimilate immigrants ; and even then it might not happen fully , but it might happen well enough so that they 're assimilated in 100 years . 
  the us too is losing that * core * of identity which forces immigrants to first integrate and then assimilate . 
  you know , on the subject of immigration everyone points to all the european immigrants which went to the us and that they assimilated and they 're now american regardless of where in europe their ancestors came from , right ? 
  but what they fail to remind themselves of is the high level of xenophobia polish , irish , italian etc immigrants had to endure in the us ; and that xenophobia played a role in their eventual assimilation as most of them though that `` i or at least my children need to speak english and be americans , otherwise they 're going to have a terribly hard life here '' . 
  immigrants coming to both us and europe nowadays simply do n't feel like that anymore . 
  in europe they get welfare even if they do n't speak the language . 
  i do n't know what to replace xenophobia with ... but a quick look at france tells me we need something and i am interested in the topic because romania is going to need immigrants sooner or later too . 
  i just do n't want to take them in the way merkel did ; that 's a recipe for disaster .

it 's all in your head mate , it 's all in the tone you choose to read it with . 
  i 'm sarcastic and could n't give a fuck , writing these comments in less than 10 seconds while taking a crap . 
  k very smart comment . 
  a comment about my username . 
  so original . 
  such logic wow . 
  genius . 
  how about the trade deficit exists because it 's too expensive to produce the imported stuf inside the uk . 
  the trade deficit also means that the uk will want to contine trading , it goes both ways . 
  you are commenting on my comment tree fuckface so you fuck off and the only people i 'm calling retard is you . 
  and no i did n't got schooled , the eu is the biggest trade block in the world in terms of volume of goods and services traded and soft power . 
  you linking a list of countries by gdp means dick shit . 
  read ** trade block ** come back when your iq is in the '90 range you inbread pice of crap . 
  eu is definitely not number one in retards , that palce belongs to great ` murica . 
  and stop your failed troling using the fifis rhetoric . 
  the snowflakes and pc culture is a ` murica thing , only place we have that in is in a place called sweden . 
  most people are not on reddit and they do n't even know it 's a thing . 
  my fifis are fine tard face . 
  no need to be sorry . 
  i 'll let you know when you need to be . 
  says stupid shit and links a list of countries by gdp as if i evern claimed we had the highest gdp or as if that proves anything regarding tradeblocks . 
  you stupid fuck . 
  you have convinced me . 
  makes sense . 
  sure . 
  for whom ? 
  hey man i get you but thing is , life gets so much better if you learn to enjoy the good parts and live in the present regardless . 
  it 's not something that happens on its own though , i have to make myself smile , like , do things and go out of my comfort zone all the time and in the end things are just better . 
  after all what we like and how we react to things are just habits we ingrained in our brain through repetition . 
  take care . 
  except you were n't just an island but an empire . 
  the money has to come from somewhere , they 'll probably agree to some kind of subdivision of the cost based on gdp . 
   you need to come up with an attribute that is larger for the eu why ? 
  no i do n't . 
  what makes something the biggest is the sum of its characteristics not a hand picked index . 
  and if you need something then that 's soft power and volume of traded goods and services which is exactly the point of a trade block . 
   the uk actually has a trade deficit with romania so ? 
  what has this got to do with anything ? 
  eu is 27 countries not romania and uk . 
  secondly , trade is not suddenly going to cease due to our independence . 
  who claimed this ? 
  it 's just harder without access to a the single market due to bureaucracy and taxes and if you think this wo n't impact your trade with more than your net contribution ( 5-7 billions which are peanuts ) to eu 's budget then you are mistaken . 
  not sure how you interpreted my last comment . 
  it was a joke , kinda true though  ) take care mate . 
   net beneficiary of the eu budget . 
  typical ~ ~ british ~ ~ leave logic . 
  i guess by your logic only london matters in uk ? 
  the eu made much more money than a couple a billions a year romania gets in net funding from having access to the romanian market and access to a 4 million young diaspora that was raised and educated by romanian money . 
  it 's a mutual beneficial relationship but i do n't expect somebody citing budget figures to get it . 
  besides being depressed and cynical assholes , romanians ca n't take a joke to their own demerit because of an inferiority complex . 
  as opposed to eu not being the biggest trade block because of a single bigger attribute some other trade blocks have . 
  you sound like the regular smug dutch to me honestly . 
  see how that works ? 
  so because two different trade blocks have ** one ** attribute bigger than eu this means eu is not the biggest trade block in the world ? 
  i never claimed we have the biggest x because it 's stupid to measure the size of a trade block by just one characteristic . 
  i pointed you to some figures which sum indicate the eu 's power as a trade block . 
  you just assumed what suited your shitty agenda . 
  also if you are going to count nafta and asean as a trade block comparable to eu than you need to also include the whole eea area when accounting for gdp and market size . 
   http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/eu-position-in-world-trade/, 
   population = china  gdp = usa not a trade block  market size/value = gdp ? 
  no  as for trade volume , i guess that you are including inra-eu trade which obviously makes for an unfair comparison what do you think a trade block is buddy ? 
  population , gdp , market size/value , trade volume and value , soft power and every other measure you can think of that measures the power , size , value and importance of a trade block . 
  i was a self-righteous cynical asshole at 17 . 
  i swear i was born old and depressed and i 'm getting younger as i 'm aging . 
  how will the biggest trade block in the world ever find 5-7 extra billions a year ? 
  / s uk leaving will leave bigger holes like soft power , a political setback and access to a market ( pending the trade deal ) . 
  the eu budget will manage . 
   russia is ahead of france by ppp gdp . 
  in your wet dreams mate . 
  wish i could fuck up my job and be given 17 billions from taxpayers money . 
  so is this a loan or are they just gifting 17 billions to extremely rich incompetent assholes ? 
  looks like barilla pronto shit with some carrots . 
  i am not emotionally involved in this conversation mate . 
  eye roll, 
  just read the rest of the thread . 
  you are not serious are you ? 
  same thing can be said for paris . 
  no bias / s, 
  we spend more than russia and china , where do americans get the idea that we depend on them ? 
  you are the most important player because you spend a lot but that 's not the same as depending . 
  it 's not like we have no army ffs . 
  you are making it to simple . 
  it 's entirely possible that a worker will spend your x days a year in different countries . 
  which labour laws do you apply then ? 
  there 's no way syria wo n't get split after this . 
  most males will be considered attractive by a certain demographic or another if they are fit enough . 
  but yeah you 're right . 
  not that progressive , just a [ forgotten fashion ] ( http://historylink101.com/n/egypt_images/male-kilt.jpg ), 
  i mean as long as you are fit , not skinny not fat , you can pull it off great and if the skirts are designed for men then it can really become a trend . 
  skirts look great on dudes . 
  the negotiations and reforms will most likely take 10 to 15 years as they did for all other balkan eu countries . 
  true , it 's their shitshow . 
  233 is the 50 % +1 241 total mp voted . 
  more than 40 % abstained which is the same as voting `` no '' in this case . 
  so the motion barely passed , in fact it only passed becaused psd managed to attract some other pms . 
  the ruling coalition psd+alde did n't have enough votes on it 's own . 
  or he just hit the wrong letter which is right to the correct letter on the keyboard . 
  nobodt is butthurt , you 're just reading too much british propaganda . 
  usa build the bomb in a couple of years from scratch 70 years ago . 
  you greatly underestimate what a developed country can achive if they make it a national priority .

  it 's the authorities ' criminal indolence and unpreparedness . 
  they sent the search parties out in the field with maps made for tourists , they did n't have real maps . 
  this is the kind of bullshit we have to deal with . 
  oh yeah , and the press attacking raed arafat , founder of [ smurd ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/smurd ) , for no discernible reason does n't help at all . 
  in fact , the last time someone attacked raed arafat out of the blue , basescu 's famous `` riddle me this '' rant , a government or two fell . 
  if we close our eyes and count to 100 i 'm sure the russian problem will go away . 
  it 's not like this is europe 's problem as much as ukraine 's or romania 's . 
  let 's all jerk each other off with pointless rhetoric and wait for russia to suddenly acknowledge how cool the eu is and that peace is really good and that violence is not good and that they should totally stop because like we ca n't anything so it 's not cool man ... dude . 
  and they call ion antonescu a criminal , unbelievable . 
  the eu will go down in history as an oddity whose overall purpose and mo have never been immediately obvious . 
  between the double standards , massive hypocrisy , selective racism and predatory loaning , i think it 's safe to say it 's a failed experiment . 
  ** but ** , even a broken clock is right twice a day . 
  the current situation in ukraine is a golden opportunity for the eu to do something unequivocally good , useful and lasting . 
  at the end of the day for all the wrong reasons , i 'm sure . 
  but if ukrainians receive the gift horse of no longer having russia breathing down their necks , i do n't think they 're gon na be looking in its mouth anytime soon . 
  your , our , `` realistically '' does n't match russia 's `` realistically '' . 
  your `` realistically '' entails a strict set of rules , walking on eggshells , a nonviolent approach . 
  their `` realistically '' does n't . 
  they are profoundly savage and the only status quo they 're willing to maintain is rape-rape-rape . 
  guess who 's gon na get wrecked when these 2 mentalities clash ? 
  escalation from the west is literally the only way this can be stopped . 
  the sooner the better . 
  anything is appropriate when russia is your neighbour . 
   romania violates the rights of gypsies russia crying racism is really funny considering they 're the most racist people on the planet next to jews . 
  `` riddle me this ! '', 
  yep , with the president being involved in not one , not two , but three cases that would 've landed any other politician in prison , probably for life , i 'd say that his ability to legally hurl bullshit case after bullshit case at the opposition day in and day out with no consequences balances the state powers perfectly . 
  thank god for his immunity , which is n't mentioned anywhere in the constitution . 
  would n't the fact that it was repelled unanimously reinforce the idea that the cc is under the president 's control ? 
  i do n't oppose the eu per se , i just wish merkel would stop trying to have her cake and eat it too . 
  you either : a ) stop supporting basescu and his tribe . 
  b ) shut up about romania 's corruption . 
  either one of these would be fine by itself . 
  but doing both of them at the same time is really stupid and leads nowhere . 
  i 'm glad you mentioned antena 3 . 
  not many people remember , or maybe they do n't like to remember , that a3 , well specifically mircea badea , has always been critical of nastase . 
  back when this [ famous photo ] ( http://www.curierulnational.ro/poze-cnr/15994maxim.jpg ) was taken , none of the dozens of public figures that are currently taking turns condemning him even dared to look at him funny . 
  not to mention being critical of basescu straight from the get go , since 2004 , when literally no one , not ponta , not antonescu , no one , was saying shit to him back then . 
  i 'd rather stick with them . 
  antena 3 is n't protesting nastase 's incarceration . 
  they 're protesting against the sinister system and fundamentally communist methodology that led to the verdict . 
  judging and condemning people based on their political affiliation instead of their potential criminal past is not justice . 
  it 's not a means to an end , it 's not `` texan '' and it 's not `` the right thing to do '' . 
  if you plan to reduce corruption , even tangentially , this kind of system is the most counterproductive system you can have . 
  it * is * corruption . 
  why do you think that eu fund absorption rate has been close to 0 ? 
  anyway , no one would be protesting if nastase would 've been tried for his legitimate communist ties or his legitimate communist mo that he operated under well into the 2000s . 
  mircea badea 's match factory ordeal being a prime example of what kind of person nastase was and where he belongs . 
  but the zambaccian case and the trophy of quality case are nothing short of pathetic . 
  the most important thing by far when talking about justice is methodology , the actual guilt or innocence of the people involved comes second . 
  by the way , i did n't vote for the usl and i 'm not a fan of ponta or antonescu . 
  [ also , i happen to be the most anti communist romanian on reddit by a long shot . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1rlkgs/children_in_exile_the_story_of_polish_children/cdp12yq ), 
  no , my point was * technically * they have it but actually they do n't . 
  that 's what the word * technically * means , i know words are hard . 
  i 'm entertaining this conversation purely out of morbid curiosity at this point . 
  what the fuck do you mean by * enough * ? 
  enough for what ? 
  enough for romania to be in line with its own constitution where it clearly state that it 's not a presidential republic ? 
  not that anyone as primitive as yourself even understands what that means . 
  hey what are you gon na do this year when basescu will be leaving for good ? 
  can you imagine what life would be like without your dadgod ? 
  you will be literally molested by communists and miners on a daily basis . 
  do let me know if you 're gon na be committing physical suicide . 
  truth be told , you do a much better job than me . 
  well , * technically * they 're in power . 
  as in , in any other country with a similar political structure , and one not filled to with wormy communist cocksuckers like yourself , the government-president relationship would ensure the authority of the psd/usl , both internal and external , in strict synergy with the president 's role as an ** apolitical ** mediator of internal powers . 
  now , even someone as impossibly stupid as yourself is bound to notice that the current state of affairs in romania looks nothing like that . 
  the roles have been more than turned on their heads . 
  basescu is acting as president * and * government * and * party leader * and * some other weird shit i ca n't even qualify including some sort of supreme distributor of divine justice , basically a dictator . 
  the only power in romania is in his hands only trickles down to his slaves , everyone else is the opposition . 
  when udrea gets so much as a smack on the wrist for the alro case or the bute case then your status as chief of cretins * may * be downgraded . 
  until then get fucked . 
  wow , i can actually take my time to [ put some arguments together ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1smzeo/romanian_parliament_sparks_harsh_international/cdzcfku?context=3 ) and objectively demonstrate why you 're a fucking mongoloid but you seem to be doing that yourself quite effectively . 
  at least drop that pathetic facade about being western and being for democracy . 
  if you call for all members of the opposition to be killed by your glorious leader without the slightest hint of humor in the year 2013 then at least let your red flag fly where others can see it . 
  ok buddy , i 'm getting the feeling you 'll be `` benefiting '' from this `` progress '' a lot more than me . 
  if by `` there '' you mean pax basescica , where the basis for eliminating politicians is whether or not they like basescu , then yes we 'll definitely get there if things go on like this . 
  do you guys not realize that this is * literally * the communist system minus the gulags ? 
   the problem is that this is just a drop in a bucket and corruption is as prevalent in politics as it ever was . 
  well yes , that happens when a country 's justice system is essentially run by one person ( basescu ) and its fundamental purpose changes from punishing criminality to serving that person 's political interest . 
  the 2 areas may accidentally overlap from time to time but i do n't see how anyone expects corruption to go down in romania when all the major institutions that are supposed to be working against it are busy doing basescu 's bidding . 
  i want to reiterate this bit of trivia . 
  basescu is the only romanian politician whose trial was indefinitely postponed due to his seat . 
  out of the greeks or romanians that actually know what the imf is , 90 % of them want to see it and its loans die in a fire . 
  that kind of thinking does n't work . 
  russia is like a virus . 
  if john has cholera and he 's holding hands with jane , who 's holding hands with mary , mary is just as exposed as jane . 
  now replace john with russia , jane with the eastern bloc and mary with the eu . 
  i mean , if you feel like it 's gon na stop at transnistria then sure , that would be the safest course of action . 
  but there has been literally no evidence to suggest that russia operates like that . 
  so how long until military action is taken against russia ? 
  their train clearly has no breaks , it never did . 
  i suppose the more ukraine and moldova slide towards the eu , the harder it 's gon na be to ignore the reality that all inches previously given to russia must be taken back asap . 
  y' all have a nice century now . 
   logical we 're talking about russia here , the tribe that has loudly and proudly denounced all things human and made bestiality ( as in acting like animals , not having sex with them ) into state policy for almost a century now . 
  the only `` logic '' they go by is ** picichi smash !, 
  latin languages ( minus french ) sound like this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4ppiajuv60 germanic languages sound like this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9x_ohcqrcw slavic languages sound like this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjvsojyx3t8 and french sounds like this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oawfctuvhh8 yes . 
  wait , you mean [ dogecoin ] ( http://dogecoin.com/ ) is illegitimate too ? 
  such sad, 
  the eu treating us like second class citizens , italian doctors saying italian hearts are not for romanians , those things .

  i do n't want any other governments to feel encouraged to step in the foot of hungary ( looking at romania in particular ) and a stronger opposition from the eu is needed like a breath of fresh air . 
  hahahahahahaha . 
  on the other hand i think a minority would take this seriously . 
  i love the pyramid of the louvre is in this pic , 
  same with the portuguese one . 
  strasbourg being a grey city ? 
  no way , it is a little jewel , full of colorful flowers ( or at least that is the image i have left from petite france when i visited it over 10 years ago ) . 
  based on what metrics ? 
  i wanted to subscribe to t_d and bet people there but then i realized they would n't follow through, 
  unfortunately that is not right . 
  fidesz has the least support among the elders ( who still vote socialist , but right now mszp and fidesz are 50/50 in that age group ) . 
  young urban voters ? 
  yes , you are right . 
  mostly ... although abstention is very high among young ( but that is a worldwide trend , not just a hungarian one ) . 
  but young rural voters ? 
  ok , let 's not make it urban/rural but young people with degrees vs young people without degrees . 
  among young people with degrees fidesz was third in a poll last year ( besides jobbik though ) . 
  just checked , it was a poll from 2015 made by aktiv fiatalok , a student and professor 's group from elte and corvinus , two of the largest unis . 
  it is exported to other places though . 
  at least in romania , a similar prison was built in the danube delta with norwegian funds ( 500,000 euro ) . 
  http://adevarul.ro/news/societate/video-inchisoarea-minima-securitate-delta-dunarii-locul-detinutii-aproape-liberi-1_57f2a6085ab6550cb83b7941/index.html#photo-head at the bottom of the article there are a few pics as well . 
  not sure how successful it is or if they are planning to extend the program ( i wish they do ) . 
  not in the big cities . 
  she did not perform well in lyon , toulouse or bordeaux . 
  but in the countryside next to it she did . 
  look at lyon for example : http://elections.interieur.gouv.fr/presidentielle-2017/084/069/069123.html she was 5th . 
  in strasbourg she was 4th with 12 % http://elections.interieur.gouv.fr/presidentielle-2017/044/067/067482.html but in the region ( bas-rhin ) she placed 1st . 
  with the exception of a few cities , she performed badly there . 
  i guess melenchon will overtake fillon as paris and its surroundings is left to count . 
  not that it matters much , but the two big traditional parties placing 4th and 5th would be something no one would have predicted a few years ago . 
  relevant username !, 
  the gap will just widen in macron 's favor from now on, 
  with 76 % counted , macron took over the lead http://elections.interieur.gouv.fr/presidentielle-2017/fe.html, 
  yes , that happens 100 % but unfortunately it is not limited to t_d . 
  just took a quick look at the comments and at least in their live thread , i would say most ca n't be bots . 
  commenting on the live stream is not possible for example . 
  but on some other threads , there are many very low effort comments that can be made by bots . 
  hmm , interesting actually . 
  judging by some user 's vocabulary ( very limited ) it might be true . 
  with some , surely not . 
  but it is a good point . 
  the_donald ... please take a look there . 
  i ca n't get enough of their tears, 
  yes , she will !, 
  in the villages !, 
  i wandered to t_d and i still ca n't decide ... are they still that deluded or are they trolls mostly ? 
  it means that small rural places were already counted while the big ones ( paris in particular ) is not . 
  i think the one where le pen is at 23.8 is repubblica . 
  but take a closer look and hover over paris ( parigi ) and you will see 0 votes counted . 
  look around paris and you will see 18 % and 33 % . 
  edit : also , scroll down and you will see le pen with 5.829.473 and think that around 35 million people voted today . 
  as people can hate the ( in this case populist ) right because soros funds them ? 
  the link is on . cat and sometimes studies are biased . 
  i 've read the article ( incredible how much written catalan i understand ) , and even there it says `` despr\u00e9s d\u2019un per\u00edode de transici\u00f3 '' which i guess means `` after a period of transition '' . 
  do you think the eu would want to hold one of the most important agencies in a country that is not in the eu ( period of transition means that ) . 
  plus the study was made by the institut d'estudis de l'autogovern ( iea ) and i would pretty much say that is biased . 
  7 million eu citizens will lose eu citizenship ? 
  in two years , over 60 million will lose it when the uk is finally out and 48 % of their citizens did not want that . 
  i truly believe there is a case of `` wishful thinking '' here . 
  and i repeat , i do not have anything personal against catalonia , in fact i love it , but there are other obstacles if spain would not be one . 
  i can see a point that it would be in everyone 's interest for catalonia to be eu member ( even spain as it is its link to europe ) but that is just not sure . 
  and if there will be two cities with equal qualities to host the ema and barcelona will be one , because of the uncertainties and the potential headache , the other one will be chosen . 
  all this being said , barcelona would be a good choice to host ema . 
  they might not veto catalonia ( although you ca n't bet 100 % on that ) but catalonia would be out of the eu and would need accession talks and then it would need to close chapters . 
  it would n't be instant . 
  then ema would be out of the eu again ? 
  i do n't think anyone wants to risk that . 
  and spain might not veto it but other countries who have potential issues with secession movements might do it too ( although less chance ) . 
  i love barcelona , i love catalonia , i love spain too . 
  i am not biased . 
  i am not a law student but i have many acquaintances who know things by first hand experience and they said 100 % catalonia or scotland would leave the eu if they secede . 
  without any doubt . 
  and i think this might be the biggest obstacle for barcelona 's chances to host ema . 
  i called out somebody who was attacking refugees and dortmund 's stand on the refugee crisis ( very pro with banners ) . 
  i really called him out and now i feel so vindicated . 
  it did not seem like an isis attack , it was just ... off . 
  even the letter . 
  the bomb outside , on the way of the bus ... it felt very premeditated . 
  [ this video promoting pula ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tw7gd9j7l4 ) always makes me smile though , especially the first guy who * spritzen * up the water screaming pulaaa, 
  birthplace of the tie !, 
  i am not sure if it is in other languages as well but in romanian tie is called cravata . 
  i think it is similar in french as well . 
  the process did not start this year but it is gradual . 
  some are trying their luck while trump accommodates in the office , with erdogan you could see his intentions years ago , if not years ago , then right after the coup . 
  who is to follow ? 
  i really hope it wo n't be italy as that would be really hard to swallow . 
  romania too might follow suit in a lighter form but the large protests this year slowed the process down . 
  france has little chance to do so but it would be devastating . 
  oh , and you forgot good ole kaczynski from your post . 
  i do n't know what is with this map but the final results in romania was 55.4 % for no . 
  but only 1800 and something votes were cast here so not many turkish citizens here . 
  initially i wanted to reply to another comment here but it got deleted meanwhile . 
  anyway , this is what i wrote : absolutely agree . 
  yesterday i 've read an article about [ potential short term benefits of a yes vote ] ( http://globalriskinsights.com/2017/03/potential-benefits-proposed-changes-turkeys-constitution/ ) it is a good article but long term they effed this massively . 
  potentially even short term . 
  i feel for the sane turkish people who are many , who now will have to live in an ever-deteriorating country . 
  there are millions of sane turkish citizens who voted no and who will be affected . 
  i wish all of you the best !,

  rekt, 
  dan nolan , budapest 19 june 2016 \u2022 7:11 pm hungarian prime minister viktor orb\u00e1n is facing accusations of fraudulently using $ 2m of eu funding after he opened a vintage railway between his two childhood villages . 
  the hungarian government claimed that 2,500-7 ,000 passengers would use the line daily in its original funding application . 
  however in the first month of operation , a paltry 30 passengers have been using the nostalgia train , which the government had claimed would be a tourist draw . 
  `` the biggest choker is that the train goes from nowhere to nowhere , via nowhere , '' said one passenger . 
  the eu , which funded 80 per cent of the project , is set to investigate . 
  benedek j\u00e1vor , an mep for the hungarian party dialogue for hungary has reported the case to the eu 's anti-corruption body olaf . 
  `` the hungarian government intentionally reported false data , as it was crystal clear even at the time of submitting the application that the estimated numbers are totally absurd and unrealistic . 
  this is cheating and fraud which should be investigated by eu bodies , '' mr j\u00e1vor said . 
  campaigners march in budapest in renewed internet tax protest play !, 
  01:54 mr orb\u00e1n has dismissed objections to the line . 
  `` nothing was ever built on cynicism . 
  if we listened to critics , nothing would ever be done in hungary , but rails have to be set down . '' however , his critics say he has been using state coffers and proxies to build a private kingdom in the area , through which the nostalgia train once ran , and where he and his family and business associates now own many properties . 
  at one end of the line is a habsburg estate in alcs\u00fatdoboz . 
  originally built by archduke joseph august of austria , it was purchased by mr orb\u00e1n 's father in 2011 , the year after his son returned to power . 
  aerial shot of mr orban 's habsburg estate aerial shot of mr orban 's habsburg estate credit : \u00c1tlatsz\u00f3.hu at the other of the line is the 3,500-seater soccer stadium in felcs\u00fat , population 1,700 . 
  completed in 2014 , the stadium is metres from mr orb\u00e1n 's weekend house , and was in part paid for with corporate tax breaks introduced by the football-loving prime minister . 
  the stadium drew comparisons with a similar vanity project of the former romanian despot nikolai ceausescu , and with crowds at the stadium often dipping below 1,000 , is already seen as something of a white elephant . 
  the case has also put mr orb\u00e1n 's personal finances in the spotlight . 
  opposition party egy\u00fctt released a mock-up rich list entry that estimates him as the richest resident of hungary . 
  `` just like putin is known to be the richest russian alive , we believe mr orb\u00e1n is hungary 's richest man , but is using straw men to distribute his wealth , '' egy\u00fctt leader viktor szigetvari opined . 
  has he been indicted ?

  same for something like catalonia , right ? 
  or negociated from a lower base because they will have to work on a new state too, 
  i thought they are center right, 
  they could should some mp of the left, 
  ppl were suspecting stay will win even before cox because the score was close and when that happens it 's status quo that wins,

   `` inside wikileaks '' by daniel domscheit-berg i read that wl threatened to sue http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/10/wikileaks-legal-action-daniel-domscheit-berg did they do it ? 
  soon they will choose what disturbs them more, 
  havent you heard democracy is a sham so lets just go full retard, 
  you see the same promoted by orthodox groups but here they also promote russia as a model and alternative . 
  do they go further like that in poland ? 
  or not yet, 
  i suspect poland will join russia on more and more issues in the future, 
  subtle to not scare away non conspiratard voters, 
   ho are actually employees of a weird and secretive corporation with dubious goals . 
  details ? 
  are they antivaxxers too ? 
  i guess he means it 's a dog whistle term now, 
  thread got buried of course, 
   the meeting is still on , but with the russian orthodox church and three others staying away bulgaria and ? 
  syrian and georgian ? 
  yeah that can explain v4s united stance on brexit, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_action_ ( uk ), 
  by : tom burgis in london the killing of jo cox , the labour mp , has prompted renewed fears of nationalist violence just as british groups normally regarded as extremist have been trying to make common cause with mainstream parties in the eu referendum campaign . 
  in recent years several far-right parties across europe -- including the british national party under the leadership of cambridge-educated nick griffin -- have tried to make themselves more respectable and broaden their appeal . 
  the bnp hit its peak in the 2009 european elections , when it secured 6.2 per cent of the vote and two seats in the european parliament , including one for mr griffin . 
  however , this was followed by a rapid decline and internal splits , with the party losing support to the uk independence party and a group called britain first . 
  the latter , founded by ex-bnp members , is described by the campaign group hope not hate as `` probably the only [ uk ] group experiencing growth on the far-right '' . 
  hard-right groups in the uk often reveal their extremist views overtly . 
  for instance , members of the english defence league , an anti-muslim group prominent in 2009-11 for its provocative street protests , expressed admiration for anders behring breivik , who killed 77 people in norway in 2011 . 
  but the eu referendum campaign has afforded the far-right the chance to make common cause with the anti-europe , anti-immigration ukip and the eurosceptic right of the conservative party -- including , to the horror of those parties , by gatecrashing pro-brexit events . 
  an edl organiser was pictured in may alongside nigel farage , ukip leader . 
  in one image , andrew edge , who in 2013 was sentenced to 21 months in jail for violent disorder after unrest at a protest , poses with mr farage behind a ukip pro-leave placard . 
  ukip said the photographs were taken after an event involving `` hundreds of people '' , adding that it could not be expected to run a profile of everyone who attended . 
  `` there is no association whatsoever [ between ukip and the edl ] , '' a spokesman said . 
  the spokesman added that mr farage had himself faced security risks because of attempts to link him with the far right . 
  vote leave , the official brexit campaign fronted by the senior conservative boris johnson , demanded in may that mark collett , former chair of the bnp youth wing , stop using its official campaign materials . 
  a spokesman for vote leave told the bbc : `` mark collett and his associates are not part of our campaign . '' mr collett rejected the demand , saying on facebook : `` this is a pivotal moment in british politics and a real way nationalists can campaign for something worthwhile . '' leader of the united kingdom independence party ( ukip ) nigel farage poses during a media launch for an eu referendum poster in london , britain june 16 , 2016 . 
  reuters/stefan wermuth \u00a9 reuters at times , the rhetoric of the far-right has been hard to distinguish from that of the mainstream leave groups . 
  last week , the bnp emailed supporters warning that 80m turks were set to `` pour into europe '' . 
  the official leave campaign made an almost identical point in a leaflet it sent to voters , while mr farage 's poster depicted a line of syrian refugees has been highly controversial , with michael gove , justice secretary and another leading eurosceptic , saying he `` shuddered '' when he saw it . 
  asked on sunday by itv 's robert peston whether , following the murder of cox , he felt responsible for stoking hatred , mr farage said he was `` a victim of it '' . 
  he rejected criticism of the poster and warned of terrorists entering europe pretending to be refugees , insisting britain would be `` safer taking back control '' . 
  the leadership of the bnp and of britain first have condemned the killing of cox . 
  but on far-right message boards over the weekend , reaction was mixed . 
  on stormfront , a prominent white nationalist forum , some praised the attack , while others saw it as counter-productive to the leave campaign . 
  in europe , perhaps the most successful example of a reinvented far-right party is france 's national front led by marine le pen . 
  ms le pen has managed to attract the support of more moderate voters by avoiding the anti-semitic outbursts of her father and predecessor , jean-marie le pen . 
  nonetheless , she has continued to rail against immigrants and islam while courting working-class votes with promises to tackle the economic insecurities of globalisation . 
  recent polls have predicted she will come top in the first round of next year 's presidential election . 
  ms le pen , like other european far-right leaders , swiftly sought to distance her party from the killing of cox last week . 
  speaking as the first reports of the incident emerged , ms le pen said it was `` not very decent '' to speculate that the attack was linked to the mp 's support for staying in the eu and her welcoming stance towards migrants . 
  far-right leaders in austria , the netherlands , germany and elsewhere have sought to emulate ms le pen and break with -- or disguise -- their fascist past .

  you do n't pay for sex , but you need to know you can rely on their product . 
  it 's obviously more complicated , but a romania-bulgaria union of any sort would , without a doubt , benefit both of us a lot . 
  i 'm shocked , ** shocked ** . 
  yes , please . 
  there 's no way we would decline that offer . 
   who the hell wants to enter a password and pay a fee per minute of usage of site ? 
  at least that was the hope when they made the law . 
  * a total of 185 countries . 
  * the idea that we can only have first/second/third world countries . 
  * romania ranked # 61 ** that must mean ** romania is a first world country . 
  ignore the statistics about rural population and infant mortality and unimportant stuff like that . 
  ** it 's undeniable ** now . 
  who would 've thought anti-vaxxer logic would benefit anything ever . 
  page 17 and page 27 for the incredibly lazy ones . 
  i would 've guessed `` p\u00e4\u00e4st\u00e4 paastosta '' meant `` pasty pasta '' . 
  did they get the `` miss '' title ? 
  yes and no . 
  while it 's true current day rep. moldova was part of moldova the country , all the records show that both wallachians and moldovans spoke the same language , had the same culture and were basically the same people . 
  if you want to take into account only the historic geo-political side of things , yes , rep. moldova was half of a different country , but i feel that that 's not the whole story . 
  that 's the problem they 're trying to fix . 
  nitpicking a bit here . 
  mexico should try a sneak attack on houston . 
  they should stop being pussies and take texas back . 
  now ** that ** would be entertaining to watch . 
  it even has a tattoo . 
  that tree really wanted to be alpha . 
  obviously people care more about it happening , rather than thinking about why or how . 
  this is in part because people hate thinking as a rule . 
  it is somewhat accepted that the initial impulse was most definitely caused by the eu membership . 
  the actual `` fight '' and it 's success is attributed to laura kovesi , and rightly so . 
  i 'd say both parts are important , but people have n't asked themselves this question that much so i ca n't give you an informed answer . 
  '' ** europe ** travel alert '' . 
  is n't declaring all of europe as unsafe a bit overkill ? 
  i 'm pretty sure wartime finland would be safer that any normal day in dc . 
  or an empire . 
   do romanians think it 's all just a mafia show ? 
  there is strong support from the people . 
  general trust in the dna ( anti-corruption agency ) is at an all time high and one of the most trusted institutions of the state . 
  romanians knew corruption was rampant for decades but they felt that they could n't do anything . 
  now everyone feels like their big brother just came to deal with the bullies . 
  this time they are getting back some money at least . 
  to my understanding they froze some accounts and will recover somewhere around 10mil $ . 
  this might not be that impressive but it 's 10mil $ more than 0mil $ . 
  also , even if they recover nothing , it still discourages corruption and this is obviously more valuable than whatever was stolen until now . 
  yes , that 's a totally valid reason to call a country a * failed state * i 'd also like to add that a letter was n't delivered last month and i saw a street lamp that did n't work a few weeks ago . 
  you had a good run , belgium , but we ca n't just ignore this stuff . 
  i wonder if it 's the gdp per capita of the countries or the gdp per capita of the regions that make today 's countries . 
  they have no reason to ignore kosovo , the czech rep or slovakia if the source data is for the regions of europe , because kosovo or no kosovo , that land was there 100 years ago . 
  this makes is it seem like it 's historical data of the the economy of the countries that existed back then and ignoring the border changes , but ( if i remember correctly ) ukraine did n't exist in 1890 and it exists on the map . 
  i know , i know . 
  i 'm just saying it 's amateur work . 
  the title is pure clickbait and the article itself seems like it was written in a 15 minute coffee break , half of it being spent spellchecking . 
  ps : i 'm pretty sure that every language uses `` cost '' in that manner . 
  i actually checked all my comments on this thread to see if i made some huge grammar mistake that would make you believe i do n't understand english . 
  thanks . 
   i am not surprised if romania was the worst offender over those years . 
  yeah . 
  hard to argue with that one . 
   corrupt european countries costing eu nearly # 800bn a year i 'm fairly sure the writers from the english newspaper know english well enough to differentiate between `` x is costing the eu '' and `` the eu is missing out on . . ''  the new estimate of the total ** annual loss ** , at # 782bn  this is because it measures the full ** cost of the problem ** i 'm certain i can find a misleading sentence in every paragraph of the article . 
  transparency international lists italy as a country with more corruption than romania . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.transparency.org/cpi2015 ) . 
  the independent linked to the same map 2 months ago [ here ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/somalia-north-korea-and-afghanistan-named-most-corrupt-countries-in-the-world-but-fight-against-a6836286.html ) . 
  i do n't understand how corruption in a country can cost the eu 800bn . 
  i can understand a potential amount of money , but the eu ** losing ** 800bn because countries are corrupt is hard to believe . 
  can anyone link the study this is based on ? 
  i 'm having a hard time finding it . 
  the worst thing we can do is panic . 
  belgium will be surely on high alert from now on . 
  let 's just hope the number of casualties does n't rise . 
   looking into the situation what confuses me is why do moldovans not support unification as much as romanians seem to ? 
  very good question . 
  i 'll start by saying that , although i consider myself decently informed on the subject , it 's still just an opinion . 
  hard facts are hard to come by regarding this subject . 
  ** history ** the region ( bessarabia ) became the socialist republic of moldavia ( 1940ish ) as part of the ussr . 
  at this point in time it was overwhelmingly populated by romanians , as bessarabia was , for the most part of history , a romanian region . 
  this was part of the divide and conquer tactic used by the soviets . 
  following their `` independence '' , a lot of people were deported into forced labor decreasing the percentage of romanians from 75 % to 50-60 % . 
  fast forward to the 90 's . 
  the ussr falls , but , as ever , russians do not let go . 
  romania starts looking to the west , relations with russia are n't great . 
  anti-romanian propaganda in bessarabia has it 's beginnings . 
  this continues over the last 25 years and now the population over there is devided : some are pro-romania , some are pro-russia . 
  ** so there 's a chance , is n't it ? 
  ** no , not really . 
  russian propaganda has done it 's job , sadly . 
  the fear of russia is stronger than the desire to join us , and this is only in discussion regarding those who do want to unite . 
  so their only option is to support an independent rep. moldova knowing that they were kept underdeveloped on purpose and that the country was designed from the beginning to be dependent on russia . 
  they have no resources , no access to the black sea , people are leaving , those who stay behind mostly lack education . 
  they are exactly how the west portrays eastern europe . 
  we could push for unification , but it 's either too late or too early . 
  sadly this is the situation they 're facing . 
  he can be president from the moment he gains citizenship , if i remember their law correctly . 
  the 10 year delay was regarding my personal opinion of the point in time when romania will be at a point economically where we can handle annexing them and not leaving them with a feeling that they were somehow cheated or of not having been worth the effort . 
  as for the reunification desire : there is strong support from romania regarding it , not so much from rep. moldova . 
  i know it does n't seem so , but i would love it if they would join us again . 
  the only problem is that my love for moldova is second only to my love for calculated decisions and not regretting impulsive actions . 
  i will address the issue of reunification as a response to another comment somewhere in this thread . 
  i 'm also happy you 're taking an interest in eastern european politics , hope you get all your answers . 
  you have to take into account the current state of romania . 
  while it 's true that the fight against corruption is working , the economy is growing and the people in general are progressively living better lives , we still have regions in the country where unemployment is very high .

  what you suggest should be an exception not a rule . 
  and this ban on selfdefence weapons makes things a lot worse because potential attacker knows that it has higher chance of success since probability of that person to have some skills or some selfedefence weapon is low . 
  you should think before and use police resources as taxi . 
  i 'm sure it will be fun when this shit will be abused . 
  nah they 're cool . 
  they even let him fly in their airspace . 
  which means either high risks ( going really hard after smuglers ) or when europe becomes a shithole that none want to come here anymore . 
  or when european states start deporting illegals en masse , but i 'm asking for too much here . 
  in that case she should be able to sue the state also for failing to protect her and she had to do all of that herself . 
  what ? 
  state can protect you 24/7 ? 
  then maybe should leave some room for selfdefence , real seldefence not just empty hands bullshit that does n't really work for most girls since it depends a lot of body strength . 
  basically danish state forces physically weaker citizens to be victims if someone wants to hurt them and police is not around . 
  we sent them after that russian clown, 
  really ? 
  source ? 
  i call bs . 
  all i could find is 5.6 for romania vs 2.2 for sweden ( gdp not gdp/capita ) . 
  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/8057546/2-08062017-ap-en.pdf/8321df8a-ba1b-433e-9cdc-bfd81e3f4a45 ), 
  spain is one of those lipsticked piig ** s **, 
  and / capita ? 
  suck it bulgaria ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  what i see is the airport worker making a sudden gesture that is instinctively interpreted by the father holding his child as a threat and acting instinctively to eliminate that threat from the proximity of his child . 
  after that the employer decides to go with a full punch because it is known that parents holding children are in the best position to want to start a fight and are a danger if they are not physically handled immediately right ? 
  nevermind that depending on father 's reaction in that instant that worker he could have hit the child the way he threw that punch . 
  what did you see while watching the clip ? 
   i wonder if it also counts those who are no longer looking for work it should n't . 
  afaik it supposed to count people who do n't work but look for work and are able to start work in 2 weeks if a suitable work is offered . 
  it helps by stabilizing state finances and in time create a better climate for running businesses witch will lead to creating wealth . 
  yes , is a long term plan . 
  situation like the one greece is in can not be solved in few years . 
   but that would have crashed the big french and german banks you 're making it sound as if these banks would have defaulted it would have stopped there . 
  most of the money in these banks are not money of people owning the banks . 
  regular citizens would have been hit as well . 
  the insurance fund ( or however is called ) can only cope with a limited failure , it can not face a systemic failure of multiple banks failing . 
  all the loses at stock exchange ( where these banks are listed ) , loss of confidence in german and french banking system ... could have catastrophic consequences propagated to regular citizen , pensions , loss of jobs , ... etc. 
  we live in times of huge interconectivity , a failure somewhere can trigger a storm in another place . 
  is not that easy . 
  sure . 
  but there must be a limit a few litters for personal use when you transit the border . 
  you ca n't cross the border with a truck full of vodka and say is for personal use . 
  or an airplane . 
  they still have reserves of sanitary alcohol . 
  on a more serious note i wonder if by doing this putin is n't circumventing his own sanctions . 
  or those are only for food ? 
  so russians ran out of vodka . 
  the thing is that some `` romanians '' ( and not only ) have shit to do for more than 3 months per year . 
  and no , they do n't have papers for that . 
  wtf ? 
  dude , how hard is it to understand what i said ? 
  do you have comprehension problems ? 
  in the future , when uk will not be in eu anymore ... 
  if you need a visa for uk you ca n't go with airplane in london and just pass the border check ( unless you have the visa ofc ) . 
  but you can go to ireland and from there just drive in the uk since there 's no border check . 
  and same for goods also , people will just traffic goods once taxes for imports are added . 
  joke 's on him . 
  if he was an islamist he would be free to kill now . 
  they do n't need it atm . 
  airplane straight to london ( luton actually ) is better for now . 
  [ right in the article ] ( https://liveuamap.com/pics/2017/07/28/21503379_0.jpg ), 
   no one wants ro read the newsheader `` germany is building camps for foreign and unwanted people - again . '', 
  and instead we read `` hamburg attacker known islamist ... ''  costs you 're giving them money anyway . 
  if you do n't is either illegal work ( best case ) or crime ( financialy motivated ) . 
  you could actually have lower cost/capita in closed camp . 
  besides what 's the big deal ? 
  closed immigration centers ( especially for people denied permission ) is not some novelty . 
  afaik romania has some closed immigration centers , basically temporary location for people who want to enter the country but do n't have that right . 
  sure , capacity is much smaller than this wave , but is the same principle and no echr fined romania for having such facilities . 
   this a government or a county task who has the power to decide in immigration matters ? 
  who is responsible for deportations ? 
   do whatever you want ( - crime ) ffs i wrote it . 
  its still german soil ( in this example ) , german law applies . 
   type of secured detention center . 
  like a closed camp for people that should be deported since they do n't have the right to be in the country and mix with citizens anymore . 
  prison would be to much . 
  remember , until this attack this guy was not guilty of any crime ( except immigration crime , but that is not enough to consider him a danger ) . 
  seriously do i need to explain the difference ? 
  in prison you 're monitored , have a schedule , locked in a cell most of the time ... in closed camp you 're allowed to do whatever you want ( - crime ) . 
  the only restriction is to stay in the camp , you can not go into `` general population '', 
   a head start on the super markets in ee . 
  and because it was n't enough they pulled some [ shitty moves ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/02/lidl-1bn-public-development-funding-supermarket-world-bank-eastern-europe ) also, 
  + known to the german authorities as an islamist + obliged to leave the country + he had not been able to be deported because he had no papers [ credit to / u/fuckupharzer for translation ] so lets allow him to roam free the entire schengen area . 
  what could go wrong ? 
  seriously why the fuck are not these kind of people kept in closed camps ? 
  and your source that does n't have this problem would be ... ? 
  that 's plain abuse of power . 
  but still ... 12 years ago . 
  things changed for the better in the meantime . 
   they do n't want a border will see about that once gypsies figure * this one simple trick * to enter uk . 
  [ my favorite ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-31/ukraine-russia-twitter-spat/8574868 ) [ 2nd favorite ] ( https://twitter.com/ukraine/status/879706437169147906 ), 
  priceless, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=lena+highway&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjuga7n46zvahxdb5okhqf_dukq_auicigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=662 ) is what russians call a highway . 
   found a bug that 's an understatement . 
  its a motherfucking huge security flaw that should be punished by guillotine . 
  i do n't know what 's worse , such implementation that should get responsible people fired and ejected from industry or the stupid reaction after they got exposed . 
  usually insults . 
  ( with added criticism but they are happy when they can find insults in that criticism to take revenge for exposing their wrongdoings and hypocrisy ) . 
  howerver one guy got fined because he refered to them ( through facebook ) as [ jerks ] ( http://www.tion.ro/timisoreanul-chemat-la-politia-locala-pentru-o-postare-pe-facebook-a-fost-amendat-merge-in-instanta/1817724 ) in a post where he put pictures with their cars parked on sidewalk . 
  that 's obviously an overreaction from police . 
  lucky you ours started to fine people who say bad things about police on facebook .

  as for office productivity software , many companies have such complex files written in microsoft word or excel ( or databases or exchange mail ) , that it is almost impossible not to lose data when converting them . 
  not to mention retraining of the personnel . 
  migration is a messy business . 
  although the tools are technically free , the maintenance costs will probably outweigh the cost of the paid software . 
  i once read an article about an austrian ( i think ) ministry which converted to open-source stuff and complained about the fact that it actually increased their costs and reduced the productivity even though their goal was to cut costs . 
  edit : found one : http://www.zdnet.com/article/after-a-10-year-linux-migration-munich-considers-switching-back-to-windows-and-office/ not sure if it was this one though . 
  uk probably makes the most out of corporate taxes . 
  wo n't the reduction significantly damage public services funding ? 
   both the horizontal and the product specific rules of origin are based to the extent possible on the standard eu rules . 
  however , for cars , textiles , fish and some agricultural/processed agricultural products canadian exporters would have had difficulties meeting the more stringent european rules . 
  a compromise in the form of rules of origin derogations for a limited quantity of exports exceptions for which a more relaxed rule applies ) was necessary . 
  in return , canada agrees to follow the eu rules for the products in question when this derogation quantity is exceeded . 
  in the case of textiles , reciprocal derogations providing for more relaxed rules of origin were also granted by canada to eu exports . 
  so eventually you 're gon na adapt to our standards anyway . 
   is it worth having gmo 's from canada in your food ? 
  quoting from the ceta summary :  for cars , textiles , fish and some agricultural/processed agricultural products canadian exporters would have had difficulties meeting the more stringent european rules . 
  a compromise in the form of rules of origin derogations for a limited quantity of exports ( exceptions for which a more relaxed rule applies ) was necessary . 
  in return , canada agrees to follow the eu rules for the products in question when this derogation quantity is exceeded . 
  so the gmos are most likely limited in numbers and , in the long term , canada will probably want to drop them too . 
  i believe high-quality food exports from the eu to canada , marketed correctly as eco/bio food , will shift the mentality of canadians to always buy healthy food and the industry will adapt . 
  it 's just a long-term process . 
   do you want a massive corporation from across the atlantic suing your government if my government does something retarded enough to ruin my life , i 'd sue them myself . 
  what people fail to see is that governments will also have the right to sue that massive corporation . 
  ceta will simply provide a dedicated court like the icj so that the process is faster , more transparent and where the tribunal staff actually know what they 're judging . 
   so certain countries within the eu would indeed benefit while others would be thrown under the bus but please tell me of any other deal similar to ceta where that would n't happen the eu itself is a giant conglomerate of trade deals . 
  if you want an example , google the eu milk quotas . 
  yeah , not that many people from the eu want a federalization similar to the us . 
  technically , eu citizens living in different countries are too different for a real federalization . 
  i think we 're fine the way we are , for now . 
  are you sure about that ? 
  the last time a referendum was made for a difficult economical and political decision , brexit happened . 
  ceta is as difficult to understand as a eu exit , and should never be subject to a referendum . 
  that 's why we have representative democracies : so that ( usually ) smarter people than us decide for us . 
  this feels so rushed . 
  i agree that , as a political battle , romania has won ( they used veto and won a lengthy battle for visas ) , but nobody seems to care about the actual agreement . 
  for example , agricultural agreements are pretty shady . 
  the eu worked incredibly hard to make agriculture around here as natural and ecological as possible , and support small farmers . 
  now we 're probably going to need to adapt to a lower-end . 
  incoming gm food , food overproduction , lowered prices , bankrupt small farmers etc. 
  the moment you say american and wine you realize something is wrong over there . 
  i 'm a programmer working on the cap payment system , so i can give a slightly informed opinion . 
  the high costs of high-quality agriculture and food industry do a lot of things : help subsistence agriculture , improve health of every consumer , ensure long-term sustainability for lands and animals , keep yields low to avoid overproduction and bankruptcy for farmers etc. 
  i agree that the level of bureaucracy is insane and there are far too many regulations . 
  but things like banning pesticides are really good and even though the purely economic consequences are negative , i want to know my food is healthy and i wo n't get cancer , rather than buying a crappy 4k tv which i 'll change in a few years anyway . 
  we should do whatever it takes to raise the quality of our food and help the environment sustain itself in the long term . 
  i say improve the regulations , simplify and optimize them , rather than dropping them altogether . 
  let 's not return to the stone age and randomly gather fruit in trees and hunt animals with arrows just because it 's unregulated and therefore simpler . 
  again , construction working is probably a poor example ( it probably is the negative part of the gdp , although foreign investors are attracted by extremely low salaries for workers ) . 
  what i mean by services is externalized services which gets a lot of money in the country : it development , financial audit , consultancy . 
  whether or not it 's bad growth , it 's how developed countries make money . 
  funding is a strange issue because our projects end up costing a lot of money because of very high project times . 
  every man-day costs money so even though the price per man-day is significantly lower , we sometimes end up paying more because the development time is too long . 
  it all went to shit after 2008 because there was a global financial crisis ; every developed country with heavy consumption had issues back then . 
  yes , but we sometimes still work our asses off and try to meet those deadlines , even if we do n't meet them . 
  a german construction worker , using better tools and techniques simply manages to work less for the same thing . 
  and their deadlines are usually less stressful and their funding is significantly higher . 
  anyway , construction working is probably a poor example for romania 's growth . 
  it 's most likely services that improved our gdp . 
  the thing is that getting warrants in the usa is significantly harder than the way our anticorruption department does , so the flashy arrests are fewer in numbers and much more restricted . 
  meanwhile , ours is like a weekly reality tv show . 
  what exactly are you talking about ? 
  well we work our asses off ; i believe it 's one of the european countries with the largest number of average weekly working hours and smallest number of free work days . 
  recent corruption fights and bureaucracy improvement has put people on edge a bit and they 've started taking their jobs more seriously , while making generally corrupt people a bit afraid of doing nasty stuff . 
  i would have liked to see a better process of fighting corruption , though ; i feel that right now it 's a bit too flashy and not precisely by-the-books . 
  to put it simply , it discourages investments in a highly unproductive but potentially great agricultural system . 
  it 's also not aligned with the free market system in the eu . 
  the law is meant to force foreign buyers to actually use the agricultural land they bought , rather than simply buying it and selling it later for simple real estate profit . 
  however , as it is right now , it would only keep the investors away . 
  i believe there are many other ways of making investors use the agricultural land , rather than this poorly thought out law . 
  that 's like for a 41k net income . 
  at around 2k euro net income , i thought of myself as a well-paid romanian . 
  now i do n't even know if our country is doing so bad or if it 's slowly turning into the usa regarding the difference between the richest and the poorest . 
  maybe they will . 
  however , the court will probably come to a settlement anyway ( if the court actually rules in favor of the eu ) . 
  nobody really wants not to sell us services in the eu . 
  why not simply not invoke it ? 
  my bet is that elections will be coming soon and some new party will appear , and they will say `` if we win , we will abolish brexit '' . 
  the same way ukip appeared . 
  then , if people really want no brexit , they will vote them and voila : a new referendum without it officially being one . 
  this though https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vesivemfg8, 
   got it , fraud is worse than killing people . 
  capitalism . 
  that 's not poor journalism , that 's intentional misinformation considered a threat to national security , which is punishable by law . 
  there 's a big difference . 
  good , that potential law is completely retarded at so many levels . 
  i 'm thinking more and more of a world war every day , honestly . 
  i hate wars , but it seems that 's where we 're headed . 
  yep . 
  technically the eu ca n't really kick the uk out of the union and they also ca n't really sanction them too much if they stay either . 
  so if the uk does n't trigger article 50 , maybe nothing will happen , politicians will simply be mad at each other and citizens will be confused as fuck . 
  how in the world would anyone describe our fiscal system as loose policy is beyond me . 
  romania has one of the most unnecessarily complex , bureaucratic and ancient fiscal systems in the world . 
  it 's true that our fiscal administration has started a massive process of optimization , but we 're 5 or 10 years far from becoming a solid fiscal market . 
  the reason taxes were very high was because of austerity forced by the imf in order to pay back a huge loan , so it 's sort of a natural process to lower them , especially since local and general elections take or have taken place around this time . 
  let 's not forget that salaries are significantly low in our country and it has been very easy for even large companies to evade taxes and win shady contracts for years . 
  once people demand higher salaries and the legal system starts being more punishing , i 'm not sure we 're going to be able to sustain the growth because investors will simply look somewhere else . 
  the it sector is sort of in an economic bubble right now . 
  salaries are slowly but surely rising beyond the return on investment of the developers , both because the people ask for bigger salaries and because they are getting worse at their job . 
  the thing is that many hoped for the sterling to go back up after a few days of brexit aftershock . 
  now economists say that the low sterling price will stay there and the bank of england need to adjust some stuff .

   for the past 25 years try centuries or since forever, 
  ive only met people on reddit that think like that or the trolls in comment sections on news sites, 
  the left seems really ideological even supporting things it shouldnt just because the us doesnt, 
  there 's no way we will do something about it just look at how weak ie juncker is with this recent comment, 
  the left loves him too for some weird reason, 
  even this guy had 3 opposing candidates in elections meanwhile the socialdem party in romania ( the biggest party ) had internal elections yesterday to decide new president there was only 1 candidate ( the interim guy who btw has a sentence for referendum fraud - replacing pm ponta who also has indictments ) and the other 2 or 3 guys that wanted to participate too were blocked by some sort of party commission won with 97 % of votes with 81 % turnout, 
  there were reports that kids there were crying of hunger or cold but the parents didnt care btw a few days ago some priests stole some old saint bones from greece, 
  it 's good standard to do polls on around a thousand people, 
  wild carpathia ? 
  he also wants turkey to be part of the ttip deal http://www.eurasiareview.com/10102015-ttip-and-turkey-eu-relations-why-should-customs-union-be-revisited-analysis/, 
   radio guerilla was my favourite , but they closed it . 
  still works at least online, 
   in french it 's paradis fiscal exactly the same in romanian, 
  tax havens, 
  pew is suddenly bad because it doesnt support the antittip side, 
  was expecting this, 
  anything binding the eu and the us is very bad for it from the kremlin pov, 
  myeah back then you just wouldnt find out about this because of censorship, 
  butthurt or something ? 
  because of populist propaganda and the opposition is much smaller than it seems online on some particular sites and forums, 
  it 's interesting the support rt gives to the antittip campaign, 
  it 's because of people like you being pissed because things like this are found out about that the problem exists in the first place, 
  commie mentality im not surprised he supports psd, 
  well the hospitals are from that time period so it is fitting, 
   i do n't understand why so many romanians take the visa requirements personally . 
  i do n't know anyone who applied for a us visa and got turned down . 
  yes we have 10 % turn down rate  meanwhile the same visa requirements keep the scum out , which is why romania 's reputation is n't as tarnished across the pond . 
  yeah imagine us support when their public has to do with a few thousands of beggars, 
  it would upset russia so at least some members including the vestehrers would be against maybe that :\\, 
  no its a dacia car http://i.ytimg.com/vi/cavln6h3gvu/maxresdefault.jpg, 
  you forgot the guillotine, 
   i do n't know about the rest of the organization the local offices do good work too just a couple days ago they raided main townhalls in 5 counties, 
   and is there no way to get her to stay longer ? 
  she can get another 3 years mandate next year but its not sure since most politicians and their media dont like her the government must name her, 
  yeah he is clueless, 
   in all fairness , the eu should probably see this and do what ? 
  local officials make bad projects , try to steal or some other screw-up and then funding is cut bruxelles cant do much about these things without federalisation, 
  eu shoveling money isnt enough when officials dont know well enough how to use it ie just last week there were 2 stories about how a couple of hospitals could lose funding because of some mess-up with the projects on our end also the townhall in craiova ( run by big crooks and the last mayor is in jail ) prefers to invest some tens of millions in it 's football team 's stadium, 
   and most middle class people go to private ones anyway http://www.mediafax.ro/social/gfk-doar-2-dintre-romani-abonati-la-clinici-private-93-sunt-asigurati-in-sistemul-public-13802916 gfk study : 93 % of romanians have only public health insurance , not private . 
  there 's also much mobster influence there, 
  and that is not relevant, 
  somebody had to make this about merkel :\\, 
  the eu ? 
  russia should it 's the other way around, 
  they should have let it be blocked, 
   another important national projects are euro and uni\u00f3n with moldova . 
  union only for propaganda purpose when elections come and the euro thing we keep advancing the joining date, 
  if protests were useless ponta would be president now, 
  doesnt make sense because schengen would help a bit with trading and investing, 
  yeah the pm did say he wants the agency dismantled, 
   main goal is collective eu bargaining for gas with russia so states that are almost 100 % 1 dependent on the do n't get shafted each time the price comes to renegotiation and suffer political pressure each winter . 
  merkel said nein to that, 
  and some local ones i think fujitsu , uti and felix something, 
  nah he cant remove him and parliament voted to keep him too ( when it voted to block some accusations that would have lead to him being removed ), 
  the pm who gave the contract , adrian nastase , went to jail 2 times so nobody cared because corruption, 
   relax , you have most of them already . 
  source ? 
  building a fence is the new fad, 
  for romania the money sent back by expats is still more than what we get from foreign investments . . so it 's a lot, 
   everyone with half a mind knows the `` corruption '' thing is bullshit well i got some news for you http://stirileprotv.ro/stiri/actualitate/scandal-la-serviciul-de-evidenta-a-populatiei-dambovita-procurorii-diicot-au-gasit-acte-false-pentru-imigranti.html just 3 days ago prosecutors found fake ids for migrants at a county hq of the service for administrating personal data records at least 40 were helped by local authorities to forge them, 
  anything happening with this http://www.novinite.com/articles/169114/us+senators+propose+visa-free+regime+for+bulgaria ? 
  disband the eu then or just leave it if domestic interests have priority lets stop pretending, 
  it 's an old quote from a right wing historian people keep repeating ( nicolae iorga ), 
  there 's the new craiova group but i dont really see it doing much, 
  they already have free movement, 
  in recent months , the ponta government has said that joining the schengen area is no longer a national priority , however . 
   can that really be true when the eu has shown to have no reservations about eastern european countries joining ? 
  apparently there 's a fear of it feeding populism ( tho it didnt stop merkel see her refugee stances ) populists mistakenly think us in schengen means more gypsies or w/e and others dont have the same ( image ) problem tbh i dont really think this is the reason . . but im not sure what else anyway, 
  bid from another company ? 
  there was no bidding process the contract was given straight to eads, 
  well now the pm 's reaction makes sense and . . it 's all even worse, 
   635 millions euros payed by romania ur own gandul article says 500 it also says that between 2007-2010 we used 600m euros from some sort of schengen facility and some other thing ( eu money ) also in 2009 2 billion euros worth of eu funds were signed for in preparation for joining schengen, 
  yeah it 's being investigated http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/03/us-airbus-group-corruption-iduskcn0jh0s920141203 going by rumours it could get schroder and a couple of our ex pms plus some other officials in trouble the bribes would be a few tens of millions, 
  i doubt our politicians want to . 
  some may not actually care for more western integration anyway . 
  just pretending . 
   not surprised . 
  yet this will have no ramifications in relation to the eu . 
  tusk said yesterday that `` some countries '' ( hint : turkey ) are using the migrants as a form of ` hybrid warfare ' , in other words , push them to europe in order to extract concenssions . 
  yeah i thought the same https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3nju2t/turkeys_erdogan_to_hold_migration_talks_with_eu/cvosu1y  i ca n't decide if erdogan is brilliant or if the eu elites are just amazingly stupid . 
  maybe both . 
  there 's a lot of crookedness in the west so there may be some cooperation or willful ignorance, 
  communists treated the orthodox church less bad than other ones like the catholics, 
  no energy prices going up did that, 
  are the prosecutors challenging it too ? 
  cuz then the sentence can be higher, 
  yes for conspiratards, 
  apparently the english fa still supports platini tho, 
  with the deal not even finished yet those 3 million europeans dont even know what they are against, 
  it 's funny to see socialists back orban, 
  um no there already were lots of them, 
  yeah but zeman got over 800 upvotes now, 
  its actually free money, 
  hahaha you have no clue how much romania is shaped by foreign influence, 
  no some random redditors know more, 
  na we keep getting blocked even tho we meet all requirements, 
  and populism does bring many votes, 
   i 'd hope so too , but the infrastructure projects are currently stalled because the government ca n't steal the money any more we were doing really bad at that even when they could steal with no worries so bs, 
  it was still like 19 % for everything, 
   do n't try to make this about nationality .

  they were basically given the practice dummy to see what they do with it , and now that they 've fucked it , it needs cleaning at most , but the real thing has n't even been touched or in any danger this whole time . 
  it 'll be interesting to see how they flip this around , but since cameron came out nr .10 and quit on the spot , without waiting to do so after meeting with brussels and activating art. 50 as he was supposed to do , and what everyone was expecting , its pretty obvious what 's going on here . 
   as he left his car in a parking lot , he motioned toward two romanian women sitting on the sidewalk next to bags of recyclables , surreptitiously begging for change . 
  i 'm growing very fascinated with this new superpower some people seem to have in determining somebody 's nationality by just looking at them  ) those women i 'm assuming were rroma and therefore could have been slovak , hungarian , bulgarian , czech , polish , serbian , albanian , greek , macedonian , croatian , slovenian ... etcetera i think i 's because in their vindaloo part of the world everybody who looks the same comes from the same place . 
  i also find it ridiculous to hear pakies and `` slumdog millionaires '' referencing how their gipsy cousins are `` rummaging trough bins '' when their entire country is basically a sovereign land fill and each and every one of them has relatives back there eating something from a garbage pile , right now , as i 'm sitting here writing this . 
   what a world we live in ... 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uclhtvfex6vhg-l7m_vhbubq ) 's a youtoube channel that two romanian guys set up last year , documenting their ongoing british job market adventure , beginning with work as warehouse staff in birmingham . 
  it 's by far the most accurate introspection about average romanians in the uk , and about as far as possible from the channel 4 depiction of romanians as rroma . 
  the eu sees people as social capital . 
  so if a british bank is to be allowed to invest it 's capital in a foreign economy to make a profit , so should a british citizen be allowed to invest himself in a foreign economy and profit . 
  ** ( it costs the uk 250.000 in education spending to put a single citizen trough to high school , so when an engineer from another country comes to the uk , you can reason he 's investing at least a million in the uk economy ) ** free movement of capital means every company can seek the best opportunity to make the most profit it can , regardless of where that is in the free market territory , then people should also be allowed to seek the same thing . 
  the idea is not exclusive to the academic level , it also applies to the lower social branches , like the working class . 
  its purpose is to maximize the contributive potential of every eu citizen and company , therefore conveying limitless access to emancipation growth and prosperity for everyone . 
  for example , if a bunch of eastern europeans go to the west midlands to pick strawberries , they empower the local entrepreneur with their value as workers , together with him turning a patch of dirt in to a productive enterprise , that is actively contributing to the economic momentum of our european economy . 
  whereas if they were to be kept from this platform for cooperation , the eastern europeans value as workers would be wasted in eastern europe on para economic subsistence level agriculture , and the entrepreneur from the west midlands would be sitting on a piece of worthless dirt , claiming income support . 
  i hope you can somewhat understand the value and mechanics of allowing as many partnerships as possible to form , between as many individuals as possible , or 508 million in our case . 
  i 'd like to know if you find this comprehensible .

  we 've got 9 out of the 15 cities with the fastest internet in the whole world www.romania-insider.com/broadband-internet-romania/ this is from 22 apr 2015 , when the 2016 figures come in , they 'll show almost 20 % growth . 
  we 're being held back from the official title of # 1 because of the lower speeds in our numerous rural communities , but as far as cities go , we 're on top . 
  but this is dangerous ground for democratic structures . 
  look at this referendum , and tell me what do you do when the comfortable constitute an electoral majority and can establish the course of your life , according to their needs to stay comfortable . 
  equal vote should mean equal contribution . 
  there is no encouragement . 
  they 've tried everything and nothing works . 
  the greatest challenge in modern times is to promote a social atmosphere where people and economies grow out of a profound desire to climb the social latter . 
  but complacency wins every time , once they get to a comfortable enough place , they just plop a deuce and wallow in it blaming everybody else for the smell . 
  ** populism = sanctuary and camaraderie for the unremarkable human garbage . 
  ** as an ideology its a resource for justifications and ego gymnastics where people who 's lives are shit , despite the being surrounded by access to opportunity , are now helped in to thinking their circumstances are as a result of ( * insert populist argument here * ) . 
  having a points based system only means letting al the indians and pakistani come in on fake documents they can buy for # 20 over there , saying they 're all brain surgeons , while eu applicants get bumped . 
  if you want to control immigration how about you start by sending back the millions of vindaloo commonwealthers that came there on student visa in the 90s , and never left . 
  you expect to keep your jobs that are related to 50 % of your exports to us in the eu , but only want share your work opportunities with the 9 million non eu jihadi john ethnic variety , and have the audacity to bitch to us about our 2 million , living working and integrating there ? 
  there is no access to this market without complete freedom of movement !, 
  if you do n't like it go sing at the next table . 
   there is a feeling that we are being smothered and worse that we are being replaced with cheap non unionised workers . 
  i have a friend who works at a uk based recruitment company , and i asked her , why do they keep recruiting people from eastern europe , if everyone there is racist and hates them . 
  and she said it 's basically because every company that plans on operating some facilities in the uk , is advised by consultants to avoid hiring a majority of `` locals '' because they have a propensity to unionise and go on strike for every ridiculous reason imaginable or quit without giving notice and possibly come to work for a short while then start dragging their feet to get fired so they can go back to income support . 
  she said that 's why they 're advised to mix the workforce with at least 50 % immigrants , who are , in their view , much more obedient and hard working . 
  she also said they simply wont build anything anywhere they do n't have access to foreigners and that the senior managers have a side `` business '' in buying up dilapidated housed even as far as 100 miles from the new location of these factories and warehouses , for the purposes of renting them out to the eastern european worker for # 70 a week , averaging # 3000 a month from a house sometimes not even worth # 30.000 and on top of the # 10 a day rent they also have a fee of about # 5 - # 8 a day for transportation to and from work , by people carrier , she said that they wont even consider hiring people who do n't live in those houses and that they have to advise workers when they arrive , not to complain about conditions and rent prices , because they just wont get called up for work any more , being that they 're all on zero hour contracts at a workforce agency . 
  in all this exploitative mess , i have failed to see how the european union is at fault . 
  it sounds more like you 're being fucked over by your own people ( as is tradition ) . 
  so not so much being fucked by immigrants as , being fucked ** with ** immigrants . 
  it really looks like you have some internal laws and wealth redistribution things to sort out first , before you start blaming the eu , who ironically could have helped out in a bunch of ways by pressuring the uk to get rid of things like the zero hours nonsense . 
  now you 're stuck in there with those neo-aristocrat oligarchs , with no access to the eu court of justice and no leverage , they basically own you again like in serfdom times . 
  you 'll still get fucked , only the torture dildo actually changes , now in stead of eastern europeans , they 'll bring in commonwealth workers from places like india and pakistan . 
  `` a culture of corruption '' basically the mayor took a bribe to rubber stamp an authorisation for a concrete bunker in an old factory to be used as a night club . 
  then the corrupt piece of shit fire department pencil pushers visited the concrete death trap , as they were required by law , but only walked in to inquire about the owners and get their bribes , without even so much as casually pointing out out of an informed professional opinion , that the sound proofing in there is possibly deadly if it catches fire , like it happened with the the station in 2003 , in rhode island , something that average people knew from seeing the discovery documentary , and knowing that type of sponge sound proofing is referred to as `` solid gasoline '' . 
  not to mention that out of the 64 dead , only 28 died in the actual fire , the rest died in hospitals because of nosocomial infections as a result of hospitals using diluted disinfectants that were sometimes watered down to 2000 times what they were supposed to be . 
  the whole thing imploded recently with a huge scandal and the director of hexy pharma , the company responsible for diluting disinfectants , ended up in a car crash that left the body unrecognisable , many suspecting he faked his death , giving that everyone is almost 100 % sure he was an operative for the romanian foreign intelligence service , and that they 're all involved in a public funds dilapidation mafia that stole about 500 billion from the romanian economy in the past 26 years . 
  ( for perspective , the city of dubai cost 350 billion to be built ), 
  we took down the government last year , after that nightclub fire , with nation wide protests of about 30.000 , from a population of 20mln . 
  / u/ladadadas thank you for this  just got me a free map of the eu :d i taught i might as well get one with the uk on there , as it seems they 're limited edition now . 
  and they wonder why we 're all for the abolishment of national governments and profoundly fascinated with the idea of a federal european union . 
  it was written erroneously for profiling purposes . 
  you are being watched !, 
  dude ... seriously ? 
  the cuban missile crisis was about actual nukes !, 
  those were n't interceptors , they were short range icbms with nuclear warheads . 
  what we have at deveselu is basically a really fancy stratospheric fly swatter . 
  just like our ** defensive ** shield is a `` provocation '', 
  i 'm all for a trade deal , i want tariff free back an forth commerce . 
  what i cant get over is the uk having full access to profit here whilst restricting freedom of movement to eu citizens , despite there only being 2 million of us in a country that has a whopping 10 million immigrants from the commonwealth . 
  why should we allow you to make 50 % + of your money from us when we do n't even get 50 % access to the work opportunities you have ? 
  if you genuinely have a problem with immigration why bother us lowly 2 million ? 
  why not go after the non-eu migrants as well ? 
  there were asian heritage leave campaigners , who literally pandered to their constituency of mostly asian people , arguments like `` let 's leave so we can shut down the eu border and make it easier for you to bring more family members over from india or pakistan '' so the eu that raised you from europe 's sick man is now supposed to be at the back of the cue behind countries like india ? 
  good ... 
  i was afraid brussels would pussy out in this and go the understanding and mildly over generous route , like they seem to do about everything . 
  i was thinking that if they budge on freedom of movement but still allow them to make a profit here , we should have mass protests all over europe to demand a referendum where we get to decide what relationship the eu should be allowed to have with the uk . 
  if they used populism to fuck us , here 's populism coming to fuck them right back . 
  they do n't get to have us as customers , and only share their work opportunities with the 9 million commonwealth while our lowly 2 million europeans get harassed and called vermin . 
  they want to resolve their supposed immigration problems ? 
  before any kinds of talks of limiting eu migration , we need to see mass commonwealth deportations . 
  at least 4.5 out of the 9 million . 
  let 'em fend for themselves in the `` international opportunities '' they think will have them , and that 's of course , if we do n't get there first and with a bigger appetite . 
  ** we call dibs on that nissan factory !, 
  ** this is all because everyone is speculating that the uk will never actually file art. 50 . 
  ** things went up the second camerun stepped down without filing first and then allowing for a pro-leave successor to negotiate an eu deal . 
  the more it looks like this will play out as a staying in with more benefits , the more markets gain back ground or even exceed pre referendum peaks . 
  when you hear them talk about a `` close relationship '' with the uk , its to do with the intelligence community in both countries , that 's what the arm ecosystem and snownen 's documents were all about . 
  unremarkable people being led to believe that their not doing well in the fifth wealthiest place on earth , is somehow the fault of immigration , and not their own limitation and inadequateness . 
  [ like michael gove ruled out running for pm  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i0quwug-o ), 
  well you ** can ** be sure . 
  because if they budge in brussels , we 'll start protesting all over europe , asking for an eu wide referendum , on britain being allowed in the common market without freedom of movement . 
  and given the recent outbursts of xenophobia against our citizens living in the uk , you can pretty much figure out how that 'll play out . 
  making a forest of impaled ottomans . 
  judging by how the media is depicting them as regretful , i do n't think this is too far fetched . 
   i 've spoken to people who voted leave , and immigration seems to be highest on their list of reasons to leave . 
  despite the fact that out of the 12 million immigrants in the uk , only 2 million are from the eu and only 1.2 million of them are from easter nations , 800.000 of them from poland . 
  despite the fact that there are 1.5 million brits living in the eu . 
  despite the fact that even with all the border control in the world you 're unable to repatriate some of the 9 million indians and pakistanis , because you 're trapped with putting up with them and the jihadi john element , by the kingdom 's `` special '' foreign policy on the commonwealth . 
  it was clearly the eu at fault here . 
  that boris guy is the most odious cunt ever to have lived .

  wow , how did this happen hehe , i wanted to comment on the lukashenko `` offering '' to take kaliningrad , sorry . 
  edit : yes , i 'll answer . 
  can someone explain what this is about ? 
  the title sounds stupid , but maybe it 's just sensationalist . 
  you 're not going to fix the corrupt government by protesting against corruption ( in general ) , i do n't think there 's anyone in russia that can fix the corruption . 
  not going to fix the skewed wealth distribution by protesting against it either . 
  which election outcome was questionable ? 
  the parliamentary ones ? 
  people protest against what they see at hand , what feels like it can be resolved . 
  you can never be completely independent from your neighbours . 
  it 's simple , it 's a part of russia , no one dares to tackle with it . 
  and it 's in russian interest that they have some territory there . 
  the uk is a bad analogy , it 's very different , there are wales , northern ireland , scotland and england composing uk . 
  if you 're passionate about it search , you 'll see it 's way more complex and it 's definitely nothing like kaliningrad . 
  kaliningrad is a net receiver , read what i sent you , and keep in mind that kaliningrad gets both funding from russia and some funding from eu . 
  but why would separating kaliningrad from russia , help kaliningrad ? 
  right now , they get funding both from russia and from eu . 
  their position means a lot to them , they are russians and have the backing of the motherland in everything that concerns that small part of the territory . 
  and then , who would actually separate ? 
  since the ethnicity of kaliningrad is pretty simple , 90 % russians . 
  the citizens of kaliningrad have mostly privileges given their `` unique '' position . 
  read this for example : http://eng.kremlin.ru/acts/5774 now , tell me one lousy reason why a citizen of kaliningrad would want to `` depart '' from russia . 
  they have security , economy , special zone , good position , good leverage in any deals . 
  why so unwillingly ? 
  what would lithuania win by closing transport routes between the motherland and that province ? 
  it 's probably one of the very few leverages lithuania has over russia . 
  because it 's russia , even though its practically a bit far from the rest of russia . 
  you 're making it sound like it would be a distinct country that keeps trying to grow into russia . 
  although they do , for reasons that / u/petshaver explained , it should not worry us because it has always been a gap between what politicians say and how things turn out . 
  right now , the cooperation of eu and russia in a lot of aspects ( commercial , scientific , politic ) seem to be at its height and rising . 
  they can , and will declare everything they can to fight for ukraine and moldova , but will not do really act towards it , since it could destroy russia 's relations with eu , which are beneficial for both . 
  you 're not stupid , you just did n't know  . 
  interesting , where are you from ? 
  also , thanks . 
  wow ... what were peace corps here ? 
  what did you do and where were you located ? 
  we had an important role due to the geographical position , between superpowers . 
  unfortunately , that meant we had to carry battles all the time , to defend instead of develop . 
   they have cultural ties to the french . 
  when romania became independent in the 19th ( or early 20th ? 
  i 'm bad with dates ) century , much of the burgeoning romanian high culture was inspired by french romanticism . 
  we entered the russian - turkish conflict on russia 's side and defeated the ottoman empire , thus gained our independence ( we were not part of ottoman empire , but we had to respond to them and pay tribute ... protection tax ) . 
  however , for reasons that are not exactly known , the russians took a bit of our territory ( though we did win some more ) . 
   romanian used to be written in cyrillic . 
  they switched to a latin alphabet a couple hundred years ago . 
  i think the cyrillic alphabet is still used in moldova to some degree . 
  yep , only two hundred years ago . 
  no it 's not . 
  in the republic of moldova people speak both russian and romanian , but romanian is written with latin characters everywhere . 
   also , the peace corps pulled out of the romania quite recently , on the grounds that they were full members of the eu . 
  really ? 
  i never heard of peace corps on our territory , got any source to that ? 
  indeed , we do need to mention that the during the period besides the obvious bad , good things also happened ( forced industrialization , forced increase of literacy , great investments in education are some ) . 
  the protests are still going and growing . 
  we never had such protests since the early 90s . 
   about 10-15 % of greek voters support them . 
  you can not just illegalize something that that many people support ( no matter how hideous it is . ), 
  the gd problem can only be solved by conscious social action and not by legislation . 
  i feel exactly the same , what you said here goes perfectly with what i believe . 
  i do n't know , but the romanian geology institute has said that it may pose great risks , and that the consequences of fracking have not been studied enough on long term . 
  the advantages of being gas independent from russia are absolutely outmatched by the disadvantages of fracking on long term . 
  guess what happens when banks open after doing haircuts ? 
  correct , bank run and bank sector collapse . 
  now that russia does n't want to bail them out alone ( though they did extend their older loan and lowered interests which is a win for cyprus ) i believe that cyprus 's best action course is to do what eu fears the most , get out of the eurozone and start printing its currency . 
  yeah hyperinflation and all of that , but at least it will be in their control and can pull it off . 
  besides , may attract a lot of investors since they become cheaper . 
  they knew that since whenever cyprus joined the eu . 
  they did n't have a problem with that so far . 
  now their in a shit situation ( which is totally different than greece 's ) and need help . 
  cyprus needs not even a tenth of what help greece got . 
  how does lending lead to lack of trust ? 
  i 'll agree that cyprus is in a extreme situation which needs extreme measures but it 's still bad . 
  troika 's not risking much , russians would risk more by lending more money for example . 
  remember cyprus is a service based country not production . 
  if you destroy their banking system they will collapse . 
  and you do it by forcing people to retreat money from your banks . 
  so who did you want to actually pay it off ? 
  yes it 's the bankers fault , but what can you do now ? 
  i doubt they have 3 billion cash that you can take from them . 
  and everyone who held money in cyprus banks did so under a clear contract , you ca n't just tax people whenever you want however you want or people will lose trust in you . 
  no , robbing your population of money is not sane . 
  it would lead to lack of trust in banks as well , people would retreat their money from the banks , and there goes the whole system . 
  how 's that good ? 
  wow really ? 
  troika 's offer was absolutely ridiculous . 
  like it or not , eu and russia will have to work together . 
  the sooner both sides understand this , the sooner this region will be better off . 
  it 's not black money . 
  those black money are held in other paradises , no sane criminal would risk doing it in cyprus , which falls under eu regulations and audit/controls . 
  so contrary to the trend ( not sure what 's setting it ) the money does n't belong to criminals . 
  but if the russians start retreating their money , there 's no savior for those banks . 
  and cyprus should know that , a levy would lead to a financial suicide , and besides , no country should be allowed to steal money from its citizens . 
  best pun ever . 
  we should n't be living in the past anymore honestly . 
  island was bailed by russian money and they 're doing well . 
  you 're not ending a fucking discussion by adding more bullshit to it . 
  i obviously meant `` real soldier '' as a figure of speech , smarty pants . 
  what 's idiotic is your behavior and the idea that you have to be in the military to criticize someone who is . 
  awesome , please do n't criticize politicians if you 're not one . 
  so you have to resort to insults .

  the values are not always the same ... 
  yes ofc , 5 % is optimal . 
  3 % is problematic there is a shortage of employable population , 7 % means that there are some structural problems which must be address before it ends up in a 20 % ... 
  they should just c4 the fking doors , then gas and flash grenades while storming in with laser pointers . 
  damn so coool  ), 
  unemployment bellow 5 % is considered by some unproductive to the economy . 
  there needs to be a bit of competition on the working force also . 
  i think another relation that should be taken into consideration is unemployed people vs unoccupied ( inactive ) people . 
  since u have a segment population that can work , which is split into active population and unoccupied population . 
  furthermore u have the a segment of the unoccupied population on the unemployment registry . 
  so unless we see the whole picture those numbers can fool us . 
  also there is a currency battle yuan vs dollar vs euro . 
  countries have used currency to balance their import / export ratio all along . 
  the problem is that some countries prefer a stronger euro while others would prefer a weaker euro . 
  which is no different from a strategic genocide ... this shouldn \\ t be the path to be taken ... 
  but we want to rat our siblings out of civil duty and general concern , and not out of fear ( unless it \\ s fear of what he may do ) ... also i think trump said smth similar that he plans to kill terrorists families as retaliation ( i am not sure ... i think i heard it on a rant about his ( trump \\ s ) stupid beliefs ... can \\ t find a source for it ), 
  in romania , is similar to what bondia_reddit said for spain , except we don \\ t have the a citizen insolvency law ( there is only one for companies ) . 
  basically once you stop paying your mortgage the bank will take the collateral ( usually the house , but other assets too if stipulated in the contract ) and try to sell it . 
  best case scenario they will manage to sell the property for enough that will cover the existing debt , if not u will still be liable for the remaining difference for your entire life . 
  the good thing is that , unless u have other assets to your name that they can seize , they can only take 30 % on your wage . 
  which is still a lot considering that u will have to pay both a new rent which is also around 20-40 % of one \\ s wage and also the mortgage for a house u will never own ... 
  but now things have changed . 
  in a way to appease this problem ( considering also the elections are at the door this year ) the legislator has thought this way . 
  ok if the property sold by the bank couldn \\ t cover the remaining mortgage then there was surely a problem on how the property was valuated . 
  since the valuation process is done by the banks internally we can see that there is a conflict of interest here , as they are more inclined to sell properties so biased over valuation is quite the norm . 
  considering all these facts they introduced a new bill that stipulates that the valuation risk must be shared between bank and client , so in the case that the former can \\ t pay his debt , he can just hand the property to the bank and be done with the mortgage , it \\ s the bank \\ s problem . 
  of course , bank weren \\ t happy about this so they are also pushing hard raising the advance payment for new mortgages from a 10-15 % to a 30-40 % which put the construction industry in a pinch . 
  ofc there are some limitation and conditions and not every mortgage can be closed this way ( you don \\ t have to have other similar properties , it only concerns houses as living spaces and not other mortgages etc ) . 
  we are still assessing the effect of this bill , to see if it \\ s good or bad for the economy ... 
  not big enough comparable to the others . 
  i couldn \\ t find any german company in top 10 except the eads consortium . 
  the thing is germany is not on the cutting edge as final product . 
  you probably do a lot of good hardware ( since germany is still in top 5 defense exporters so got ta be doing smth ) which is assembled or integrated in their final product by other companies . 
  the reason that such companies haven \\ t appear yet is because german dod investment are low , compared to usa , china , russia . 
  this is my take on things , but ofc i could be wrong . 
  weird what is happening in poland . 
  in our press is presented as ( the overall pis assessment ) as a starving wolf trying to eat as much as he can as fast as he can . 
  most of the changes are seen undemocratic since they want to bring some institution under their control . 
  the irony is that in my country there is that facto already and we are trying to get institution out of politicians control ... , 
  they are happy to get 400-500 euros in romania , especially if they do n't have experience ... 
  why be so selfish and leave poor moon so alone :( (, 
  not saying it isn \\ t but i presume more than 50 % who have s files are related to terrorism and potential radicalization or proned to radicalization . 
  also some of the last perps , where not on any watch lists , the only common denominator being unsocial behavior , some psych triggers and muslim heritage ( the nice shitbag was nothing alike a muslim in the true sense ) . 
  what i am afraid is that we will be starting rounding moderate / modern muslims and which will just speed up the radicalization process in vicious cycle ( never ending war like israel - palestina ) . 
  we need soldiers , but also we need the gear and tech would that give them a competitive advantage and higher survivability ... i was not debating on uav , but on a general investment in military r&d . i think this is why a country like germany doesn \\ t have big defense companies . 
  from what i managed to see most notable defense contractors in eu are eads ( fr/gr ) , finmeccanica ( it ) , thales ( fr ) but are at the [ bottom of the list ... ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/biggest_arms_sales_2013.png/300px-biggest_arms_sales_2013.png ), 
  we should make moon colonies and exile them there ... 
  because there was no proof he was still planing smth ... we are not still at the point were people will accept putting every one suspected of terrorism in | camps | . 
  basically to be sure , we would need to do what erdogan is doing and also monitor anyone who would be radicalized not by isis , but because our zealous purge / rounding . 
  but if this continues , and people will start dying random retribution will start . 
  also i don \\ t think icbms could do the trick ... they will be probably intercepted by both sides ... most probable successful nuke scenario would be to have air superiority and drop a g bomb , unless someone doesn \\ t achieve 1st hyper speed cruise missiles . 
  / the fuck do you want us to do , invade crimea ? 
  no god no ... nothing of sorts . 
  what we need for germany and fellow big eu countries is to not send mixed signals ... this is the problem ... when the cancelor says one thing but then the foreign minister says another thing ... uncertainty make everyone itchy and nervous ... 
  also european countries should also start investing in new tech ... 
  more likely than we would like to think ... 
  also i think usa has also a problem with the fact that most european countries use their military budget for wages and current maintenance and dont invest heavy in new tech like they do ( just consider darpa ), 
  you say this as if they could defend themselves and the are doing nothing . 
  maybe they want to rely on germany lets say cause 1st 3 german cities have more population than all 3 baltic states combined . . imo all 3 states should have an integrated army of around 30k , infantry + naval , while letting air defense in the hands of the allies . 
  well you should also think into consideration why that happened . 
  back then geography and climate had a more influence then today upon the battlefield . 
  technology has made sure such handicaps can be minimized . 
  also an occupation war , which is implied in some posts , i hardly consider it possible ... more likely a hit and retreat approach inside friendly territories . 
  partizan wars are harder to subdue then before , especially if the local population has an appetite for it ... 
  or romania also alongside czech republic and slovakia . 
  by this way of thinking basically all eastern europe is russia \\ s legit birthright ... 
  doesn \\ t poland \\ s 31bill budged for army modernization go towards us and british companies ( lm , ng , bae , ryt ) ? 
  these attacks are terror related in the same degree as usa mass school shootings might be also be considered terror attacks . 
  in these cases , from what i read , isis propaganda is just the trigger , but i think any other similar stimuli could have made them lash out . 
  replace isis ' kill the infidels with a far left 's message kill all rich enslaving bastards and you might have a similar result . 
  maybe not same persons since these seem to have their hate fueled by cultural differences , but others who are susceptible more to a different trigger . 
  regarding isis i think they would claim responsibility even for a fart if that would upset us too much . 
  btw how are cctv cams in munich ? 
  because somehow ... people on the edge who usually used to end through suicide or killing his neighbor at worst , are now getting the idea that mass murder a cooler way to go down ... 
  romania 4k + deaths / y only from reckless driving , mostly young people ... 
  could it be the extreme right wing ? 
  yes very very confusing might not be isis ... 
  find it weird perp was n't caught yet ... this may be a new breed of * leech * terrorist , those who do n't wan na sacrifice themselves ... they hit and run ... 
  the motive is enough even when no casualties, 
  hungary , poland , romania was really really close to get a shitbag too and other parties in other countries might swing the same way if given the opportunity , but their chances are increasing ... it might not be the case of coups , or religious fundamentalism but some leaders have shown autocratic tendencies , while slowly but steadily hurting civic liberties , decisions transparency , meritocracy , extreme nationalistic propaganda ( which can be as hurtful as a religious propaganda ) etc. ... so i ask you how far are we if we do n't find a way to correct this ... 
  i think he was referring to a heart problem like those u see in house md  ) , but which u do n't know how to name or to translate ... congenital heart myopathy for ex ... which ended in heart failure ... 
  not sure , i am uncertain myself of how it will be ... but at 1st we will just be jobless , without a penny , maybe after we will live like in arab states , payed to stay put ... 
  the problem is that robots are getting cheaper and smarter in terms of work efficiency ... i just read an article that on an assembly line in a factory , they put the 1st robots that can work alongside humans without the fear of injuring them , ofc doing the hard things like lifting , pulling , while human worker does the finesse tasks . 
  this was greeted with enthusiasm , but that robot probably laid off another human worker . 
  in the future even white collar jobs will be threaten by smart self learning algorithms ... it 's just a matter of decades ... the digital revolution wo n't be like the industrial one ... 
  do n't worry too much we all have our erdogan in the rising unfortunately ... 
  we wo n't reach 2 this year ... 
  if you establish a costal city u get a bonus .

  my boss has a calendar with her naked in his office . 
  not on the wall ofc  ), 
  not just germany ... 
  what is their point ? 
  ok cool we are doomed ... 
  you used the conditional , which is ok . most people are stuck in the present :p, 
  ca n't really say tbh you 'd have to ask them , 
  then italian wo n't be such a hard task ... with time you will get used to i guess . 
  how hard was for you to learn spanish ?

  http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/29/3d-printer-guide/ my point is they are getting cheaper and easier to make . 
  foster and partners are on to something .

  yes . 
  we get defensive and angry when we are being discriminated abroad yet we discriminate all sorts of minorities here in romania, 
  everybody wants a piece of the western life style, 
  romania has different regions influenced by different cultures along the history,

   but also indo-european like romanians . 
  romania is not the only indo-european nation on the continent . 
  [ link ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/indoeuropeantree.svg ) if you you look closely romania and romani are on the oposite branches of indo-european languages . 
   no , you 're wrong [ 1 ] . 
  the link i provided says otherwise . 
   romania has a historical duty towards roma due to slavery and the holocaust and it 's far from repaying it . 
  you 're joking . 
  right ? 
  many countries have historical duties to ethnic minorities ... from what i know romania is not responsible for the holocaust . 
  a lot of gypsies were deported from romania during the holocaust . 
  but other ethnic/religious minorities suffered the same faith . 
  romanians were enslaved ( they were treated like second class citizens ) by the austro-hugarian , rusian , ottoman empire and many others do we have the right to get their countries just because . 
  no not really . 
  and by your logic . 
  germany should give their country to the jews . 
  or any country that has a history of enslaving people . 
  that 's not how things work, 
   for a start both are indo-european people and romanian culture is more oriental and southern while hungarian culture is more central europe . 
  i asked for articles anything backing up your statement . 
  you just wrote another personal opinion . 
  romas are of asian descent middle-eastern . 
  [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people ) . 
   do you disagree ? 
  you presumed that romania has the largest population of romas . 
  factually speaking romania does n't have the largest roma population [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people ) i think we should better integrate them . 
  some countries including romania made the first steps in the right direction . 
  anyway . 
  i think you 're a troll . 
  inflaming discussions .

  oh , go in a firing nightclub , you nitwit , i was remarking the ironical ( perhaps cynical ) coincidence . 
  `` agenda '' . 
  another useful idiot with internet connection to imply `` agendas '' . 
  gfy with your horse glasses . 
   maybe you should blame the club owners and the ones responsible for safety instead of the victims ? 
  the `` victims '' knew what they were going in : a small building with no safety space in case of emergencies . 
  alas , here you are , asking for regulations so that everyone should have a hand to hold on . 
  face it : they knew where they were going and what the risk could 've been . 
  they bet with their lives & they lost . 
  they 've consented themselves by not having second-thoughts . 
  this is n't strictly about law , it 's about having a brain in that skull of yours , along with eyesight , and the sense of self-preservation . 
  ffs , look in what country we have , what infrastructure and so on !, 
  and if you 're going to imply the responsibility on the owners , let me bargain on top of that : who gave them the licenses to open/legitimize the building as a nightclub , you nitwit ? 
  santa clause ? 
   you 're not a `` degenerate '' if you want to have some laughs with your friends . 
  you can have laughs in your own private parties , not in a crowd . 
  alas , the zombie-like mentality have so much to be desired ... let alone for expectations . 
  keep this on mind , since redditors might not realise it , yet some of you will pass it intentionally : ** how many of those who survived , even some of the injured , are murderers ? 
  ** ever heard of *** `` stampede '' *** or , to be more precise , of *** `` crowd rush '' *** ? 
  i 'll repeat again because it 's important : ** which ones of those who survived , including the injured , are murderers ? 
  ** have fun seeing it from my perspective . 
  * keep the downvotes comin ' you pure , narrow-minded , snowflakes . 
  i am right on this one . 
  * for once , with personal proof from now on , agoraphobics are legit . 
  i do n't know how to feel about this . 
  for one , what the hell were they doing in such a small crowded building ?!? 
  remember , this is n't your typical club , with lots of space , no , it 's somewhere small in terms of safety . 
  you 'd think self-preservation would 've kicked in but , no , the zombie crowd ( since it 's halloween ) mentality won the day ... and lost their lives in return . 
  second , this miniature shellshock ( keep the counter going up ) will nicely bring down to earth , on their feet , some zombie-like degenerates , hit in the face with reality when life ai n't anymore about being cool or about extravaganza or vanity or what car you have or what social backround you 're in . 
  maybe , this moronic incident might change something from the perspective of collective mentality . 
  lesson learned . 
  now prepare to watch the [ political ] propagandists turn & blame on each other like the dead policeman 's case . 
  though , i have to admit , these type of social shellshocks are actually good : it disturbs the social lethargy & the status quo our society has moisted itself in , and remind ourselves in what country we live , what economy , what infrastructure , what ... * about everything * . 
  it 's good but compromises must be made . 
  oh well ... at the end of the day , the cruel reality wins , always . 
  alas , with this little tragedy , i 'm quite curious how things will evolve , on all levels . 
  last we need is another earthquake and bam ... that would be the last drop as an incentive to * actually * do something ... but that would be far too late . 
  by the way , in case you 're not observing nor wanting to think about it : ** the parents have no excuse ** . 
  their tears have no excuse . 
  and do n't forget the crowd rush ( stampede ) : which ones of those who survived , included the injured , are murderers . 
  he attributed that himself , you and others like you months ago for lurch . 
  you 've taken your position , do n't retract it back just 'cause you do n't agree to it no more . 
  you and others hate the social democrats , yet you see this surplus like a big ... plus . 
  foreign capital = / = domestic , autochtonous , capital . 
  when xenophilia runs rampant , nothing 's going to change . 
  you really ought not to think all of us have short-memory . 
  gtfo ... 
   still has nothing to do with the budget surplus . 
  all social-democrats are evil but , apparently & completely unbelievable , this budget surplus appears to be a good thing . 
  you can figure the rest of the straw-man fallacy yourself , boy ... 
  you did n't read the whole comment , have n't you . 
  do n't look at it as if it 's a good thing : because of fear , officials will act like autists dealing with problems . 
  `` a road needs fast repairs . 
  nah , ca n't risk a denunciation from an unknown denouncer if we start paying to repair it . '', 
  `` schools need help . 
  nah , the secret services are listening to me and they 'll most likely bring denouncers to accuse me of something . '', 
  this ai n't the dictatorship of the constitution . 
  it 's the dictatorship of prosecutors and the secret services . 
  it 's a period that i like - even if it 's not pc to say/write it as such , it 's the most accurate - to call it as `` the autistic bureacratic period '' . 
  they are fearing of being denounced by some nobodies , while having to through character assassination and flashly headlines that give the impression life 's improving . 
  it 's not . 
  one more thing to clarify , which some of my conationals would , intentionally , fail to mention : the ` heavies ' from the previous government , liberal-democrats & their financial supporters + the ex-president , are safe n ' quiet after all those billions stolen , before 2012 . 
  after 2012 , lib-dems fusioned with the national-liberals , that supported lurch the previous autumn elections . 
  in other words , in case you do n't understand the situation : all social-democrats post-2012 are evil but , gosh-darn it , it 's only a * coincidence * that the heavies from libdems , now in the ` bigger-ish ' nationl liberal party , are all taintless . 
  a lot is n't being done because the influential head of the dna and the secret services were all appointed by the previous president . 
  they 've struck a deal to not bother him & his former pals with corruption charges ( the * real * stolen billions ) . 
  enjoy your flashy headline ... 
  why would * we * care , we do n't have our own capital in domestic hands or autochtonous businesses , corporations , multinationals . 
  everything 's a territorial lend-lease for production that is n't in domestic hands ( and by `` domestic hands '' , i mean * our own * entrepreneurs & businessmen ) . 
  forget about it . 
  do they have a choice ? 
  *** i see the downvoting brigade has assembled . 
  hmm ... ***  to explain the background : this article comes from a tv station that belongs to one of the corrupted politicians kovesi 's anti-corruption agency put in jail last year . 
  prior to being the agency 's chief , she was romania 's chief prosecutor . 
  the prosecutor whom indicted him was found a corrupt bastard that abused his power as a prosecutor . 
  you 've let that out . 
   she , along with the former agency director moraru , are enemy no . 
  2 and no . 
  3 of this `` news '' organisation . 
  oh , yes , [ morar ] ( http://www.antena3.ro/en/romania/daily-summary-criminal-prosecutor-emilian-eva-restitutions-magnate-305930.html ) . 
  \\* * note to the english-speaking folk in here : there are n't enough sites , dubbed in english as well , to tell as much as it can be said about daniel morar , the ex-dna chief , which served the previous president . 
  a lot of corruption and political police in the name of `` independent justice '' . 
  *  she already won an anti-defamation lawsuit against them . 
  they were unjustly made to pay 60,000 euros because they have shown irrefutable proof ( video + audio ) that the ex-president brother was doing illegal business with certain gypsies to influence judges ( surprise-surprise ) , while the ex-president & his brother getting a cut . 
  [ more about the case ] ( http://www.antena3.ro/en/romania/the-mircea-basescu-bercea-scandal-in-the-international-media-293434.html ) , as you can do additional searches yourself . 
  however , the part regarding kovesi 's defamation lawsuit , was because the news channel has said numerous times that she protected the president 's brother regarding this case with the gypsies . 
  and she did . 
  regardless , the `` independet justice '' found that it was a ` defamation ' case for telling the truth . 
  [ more about the ex-president 's brother . 
  ] ( http://www.antena3.ro/search/mircea-basescu.html?lang=en )  basically , the only thing they have n't accused her of so far is having gills , otherwise everything it 's been there . 
  no , besides doing a fine work themselves regarding corruption , they have repeatedly said it in the past the following saying ( translated from romanian ) : `` all of b\u0103sescu 's people/henchmen , including b\u0103sescu himself , are horrible people that committed the most hideous corrupt acts , yet the people b\u0103sescu put in dna and sri ( romania 's fbi ) are immaculate and incorruptible . '', 
  with an * / s * at the end , of course . 
   antena 3 is essentially the romanian fox news , except with less backbone and moral fiber ( yep , possible ) . 
  is foxnews affiliated with cnn international ? 
   so take it with a grain of salt . 
  as a matter of fact , she did n't `` denied the charges '' or dismiss the charges as the title says , but did n't prosecute in 2007 due to procedural problems . 
  she did in fact ordered it re-investigated , not closed . 
  ( they say as much in the article , lol ) . 
  she became general prosecutor in 2006 , that file was under investigation for nearly 17 years at that date . 
  to give you an idea , until 2007 iliescu had not been interviewed about the charges even once .

that 's not something to brag about . 
  make serbia stronk again !, 
  120/month ? 
  damn . 
  if they find out romania pays 135 we 'll be getting snackbar 'd as well . 
  let 's hope you do n't have an accident . 
  hear that poland ? 
  sweden called you dumb and small . 
  i think they want to fight . 
  maybe in 30 years you 'll see her . 
  this is a contest for d list singers and has-beens . 
  my theory is that even though nobody will officially admit it , no country wants to win the contest . 
  the winner has to host the next contest and it 's a huge money drain because nobody gives a shit about it so every country sends their weirdest and shittiest singers in order to lose . 
  except sweden and maybe a couple others . 
  since a few years ago they show fewer ads than other channels but they still show them . 
  at least nobody will embarrass us in the musical freakshow 2016 . 
  just load up the tomatoes in a plane and fly it over ukraine . 
  they 'll end up in russia . 
   are the ones you identified on the way to becoming ice warriors ? 
  are they becoming vikings ? 
  good job , sweden . 
  you integrated them . 
  it 's coincidence . 
  you wrote 5 words . 
  why do you expect the reply to be any longer ? 
  got ta wait until he tweets these opinions . 
  it 's the only language they understand . 
  because a gypsy woman especially should n't do that . 
  she 's in high school , which means she should be already married and have kids . 
  i bet her family is angry that they ca n't arrange a marriage for her because of this behaviour . 
  if she acts like that until she graduates she 'll be too old to marry . 
  because it 's this exact same thinking that caused this situation . 
  i 'm sure all that teacher wanted was to not seem racist and to not add fuel to the anti-immigrant fire . 
  that 's why she did n't intervene and tried to sweep it under the rug . 
  the immigrants were given a free pass and all that does is show them that there are no consequences for behaving like this , which makes the problem worse . 
  the only way this problem is gon na end is if we keep talking about it and shine a spotlight on it , even if it makes us uncomfortable . 
  i was hoping they were brazilian so that the discussion would turn towards the dangers of the zika virus . 
  would you feel more comfortable criticizing white people instead of immigrants for a gang rape ? 
  you were hoping white people did it ? 
  that 's exactly how it works . 
  most of them would have stayed in africa and the middle east if they had n't been invited . 
  and they are afraid of what exactly ? 
  the isis in turkey , greece , macedonia , serbia , hungary , croatia and slovenia ? 
  when a couple of them accidentally came here they started crying and begged to be sent back because they were so afraid of the romanian isis . 
  i also want a fair distribution of refugees between all the countries that invited them . 
  it would n't be fair otherwise . 
  are you sure you should be eating that ? 
  it 's haram . 
  i 'm pretty sure the number includes potatoes used to make vodka , that 's why russia , ukraine and belarus are so high up . 
  1 guy was enough to take montserrat from 1st place to # 196 . 
  i did a bit of research and apparently an immigrant killed a woman in 2008 . 
  this was the first murder they had since 2002 . 
  surprisingly not that many . 
  hess lived to 93 and only a few thousand jews had died before he was captured . 
  for 90 i 'm sure a couple thousand would be enough . 
  if you 're in your 20s , that 's just 1 every 2 weeks or so . 
  perfectly doable . 
  good luck . 
  they should be allowed to commit suicide if they want to . 
  you 're not a free man if you 're not in control of your own life and death . 
  what gives you the right to stop them ? 
  [ how about this ? 
  ] ( https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/disp/764d4911453679.560fa66557dbf.jpg ), 
  idk , america is about to become great again . 
  can you say the same about sweden ? 
  i know germany does n't have the votes but they have a lot of political influence . 
  it 's basically them , france and uk running the show . 
  with problems such as this they can easily guilt the other members into voting in germany 's favour . 
  they almost succeeded a few months ago . 
  then merkel does n't need to ask the other countries to take immigrants . 
  she can just force them to do it . 
  why ca n't the rest of bucharest look like this ? 
  most of these have chimneys so i guess they 're fine in the winter . 
  we have a few others .

  [ this could work ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hpxawms.png ), 
  that 's just what europe does . 
  remember when we were being criticized for not doing enough to help gypsies and integrate them into society ? 
  well , they 're european gypsies now and we 're still waiting for them to show us how it 's done . 
  everyone does what 's best for themselves . 
  if it makes you feel any better , i agree that unchecked immigration from eastern europe is bad for the west but if you wan na take in tens of thousands of gypsies who beg and steal so they can build mansions back home , i sure as hell wo n't stop you . 
  it also does n't mean that we need to make the same mistakes as you . 
  [ hungary has one as well ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8quv-4shek ), 
  quit it with this `` fighting back creates more terrorists '' crap . 
  these people will use any excuse they can to blow themselves up because they 're messed up in the head . 
  they killed hundreds of french people and how many of the victims ' family members went to syria to blow themselves up over it or how many went on killing sprees as a result ? 
  none . 
  but if you blow up a terrorist base and your third cousin , abdullah , who was walking nearby got hit by shrapnel all of a sudden he must be avenged and death to the west . 
  are n't you guys getting terrorist threats as well even though you welcomed every immigrant with cheeks wide open ? 
  it does n't matter what you do , to these people any minor misstep will reinforce their beliefs that the west is evil . 
  when you love someone , even their farts are cute but when you hate someone even the way they smile annoys you . 
  it 's like that . 
  you only did it because your cops are too fat .

   if norway lost 30-40 % of its gdp next year , and 50 % norwegians lost their jobs , bulgaria , romania , and any country with a stable economy would be better off than them too . 
  i do n't understand how you can believe that . 
  50 % of norwegians would * feel * worse subjectively , but that does n't mean that bulgarians would be obligated to give them money . 
   you did n't because you could n't . 
  perhaps , but that 's missing the point . 
  the point is that countries are sometimes in economic free fall , but for some reason it 's only considered a humanitarian catastrophe when it happens to a ` special ' country such as greece . 
  what is the point you 're making ? 
  the context is this : our economies have been in free fall too , but we did n't blackmail an entire union of 28 states , and it would n't have been right if we did it . 
   greece 's trajectory is much more dire and in need of fixing greece 's trajectory is not pretty but it can only be fixed from within . 
  yes . 
  but what is your point ? 
  group generalizations are possibly , but not necessarily , incorrect . 
  also keep in mind that a correct generalization can still allow exceptions . 
  saying `` in general '' is not the same as saying `` every time . '', 
    is it incorrect , though ? 
   insofar that generalizing any group is . 
  in other words , it 's not necessarily incorrect . 
  what if he 's right though ? 
  if he 's telling the truth then i can understand why he 's pissed . 
  is it true that the clinic where he 's hiding is owned by erdogan 's family ? 
   they all use roads [ etc. ], 
  and they all work for small wages to build those roads . 
  the question was , will the power be abused by the prosecutors themselves ? 
   he writes about a kind if collective , unspecified , lingering guilt about something that happened to the neanderthals that humans have experienced for thousands of years neanderthals were humans too . 
  we probably ate them . 
  you mean they were immigrants ? 
  well , burning wood counts as renewable , so for some renewables it 's possible to consume them faster than they can renew themselves . 
   first of all , those sexual harassment laws are specific to the workplace and fall under labor laws , they would n't apply to someone just visiting the us . 
  you 're right . 
   more to the point , if you make a sex joke at work and someone is uncomfortable ( gender does n't matter one bit ) , you ca n't be sued for sexual harassment - unless you are asked to stop and keep doing it . 
  are you sure of that ? 
  the state can create growth at times . 
  what i 'm saying is that this is n't always possible . 
  is it an option in greece ? 
  i do n't know . 
  if the alternatives are framed as austerity vs. growth , then we 're presupposing that high public expenses always lead to growth . 
  but that is n't obvious . 
  also in greece not even growth will help unless they actually collect the taxes . 
  well cutting pensions would allow the government to keep not-collecting taxes . 
  on the other hand they could try to collect their taxes . 
  i heard syriza promised to try . 
  it 's not impossible to do . 
  if it can be done in romania , then why not in greece ? 
  the new deal was n't an order . 
  it was a strategy that worked in a certain context . 
  does greece have similar resources as the usa ? 
  i assume not . 
   i 'm far from a expert but growth can be achieved with simple measures like lowering the taxes on businesses like ireland did or improve the legislation . 
  if i understand correctly , then greek businesses already avoid paying most of their taxes , so lowering the taxes wo n't do much to help . 
  improving the legislation ? 
  maybe . 
  but only if it 's the legislation that 's your actual problem . 
  they can try to sue you for anything , but only some lawsuits will be taken up by the courts , and only some of the latter will actually by lost by you . 
  with sexual harassment , the jurisprudence says that if the ` victim ' was ` made ' to feel uncomfortable , then you lose . 
  i never said you 'd get arrested . 
  the discussion is about getting sued . 
  at least i 'm sure it 's more worrisome than the waste from nuclear power plants , which can be collected and stored ( and eventually returned to the mines where it came from ) . 
  carbon 13 is 1.1 % of all the carbon on earth . 
  up in the air , that 's worrisome to me . 
  burning coal is worse than terrible waste . 
  instead of collecting the waste you just dump it all in the atmosphere . 
  by the way coal includes carbon 13 and carbon 14 , both of which are radioactive . 
  that is very aggressive coloring , but it 's better than what we have . 
  edit : actually i did n't realize you had four links and i only clicked on ` fucking . ', 
  i agree that the other three are dumb . 
  that part is the worst part . 
  france has a long history of suppressing its cultures and ethnicities , and to an important extent they still do that . 
  looks like these self-proclaimed ` anti-racists ' are the same old nationalists who destroyed half the cultures of france . 
   the greek one suggests the following simple thing : growth will be more beneficial than austerity . 
  growth is a nice thing if you can have it , but it 's not something that can be ordered by the government . 
  especially not if it 's real growth , as opposed to real estate getting more expensive because of irresponsible lending . 
  probably , but not certainly . 
  if you make a sex joke in the presence of a woman and if she says she felt uncomfortable , then you 're guilty of sexual harassment according to us law . 
  i know it sounds too crazy to be true , so feel free to double-check . 
   state owned companies inevitably go down the drain all companies eventually go down the drain . 
  but state-owned romgaz and nuclearelectrica have n't gone down the drain yet . 
  human rights do n't include moving to any country that is convenient . 
  i know it should n't why not ? 
   it 's borderline unethical to pass a law that will mostly affect the part of the population that ca n't vote yet but we do that all the time . 
  we have laws about education , about childcare , or about environmental policy . 
  many of those affect primarily those who can not vote yet . 
  but you would n't impose the new law retroactively on people who have already been working for a while . 
  it would only go into effect for those currently below a certain age , e.g. 
  look at the twenty-year-olds of today , who were raised by so-called helicopter parents . 
  they received what is best described as extraordinarily ` adequate ' upbringings , and that 's why they ca n't cope with real life . 
  as a college teacher you have to be * very * careful when you let one of them know that their answer was wrong . 
  the best upbringing is a lot less harsh than disney 's , but it 's a lot less pampering and time-consuming than what people do today . 
  parenting does n't have to take as much time as it does . 
  four-month-olds do n't need to go to ` music school ' ( that 's an extreme example , but it happens ) . 
   even people that do have kids nowadays end up not being adequate parents i think we might be exaggerating how much it takes for ` adequate . ', 
  look at walt disney 's childhood , and apparently it was still adequate . 
   and the problem with irrationally high financial compensation is that it 's , well , irrational . 
  it does n't have to be irrational . 
  here 's the rational way to do it : make retirement pensions depend on the number of your children , and on how well-educated they grew up . 
  if there are n't enough young people in the future who can work , then your pension wo n't be worth anything anyway . 
  so it only makes sense . 
  actually , i am interested in the hairstyles of male cosmonauts . 
  i wish more people paid attention . 
  ( and i 'm not even gay . ), 
  yes , the heritage thing is a serious problem .

  lets assume in cases where the attacker is older , the parents have n't been in contact with them for years or even decades , do they still go ? 
  still their fault right ? 
  `` fuck the ragheads '' , no ? 
  whats that ? 
  north korea is barbaric ? 
  damn right !, 
  with their political murders and their collective punish - oh . ~, 
  bad idea on the referendum - you know what will happen here , the more organized and zealous psd electorate will come out en masse , while the majority will not care . 
  sprinkle in some fraud too , and the bill will pass just as they want - after that happens , he ca n't say anything anymore , it was ` the will of the people ' , right ? 
  just change the things wrong with the bill - no amnesty for corruption , no amnesty for suspended sentences ( lol . . ) , let petty , non-violent offenders go , especially the older , and that 's it . 
  snark aside , the bill also pardons corruption cases with ** suspended sentences ** ( as in , not going to prison ) , this is why there are protests . 
  just a lot of older people that are used to voting this way , psd is the most recognizable political `` brand '' in romania . 
  it does n't help that the opposition is either a laughable mess that is only slightly better ( pnl ) or still new on the scene ( usr ) . 
  it will die down by then , in fact i 'd be surprised if there would still be anyone out by this time next week . 
  even if they do n't , it 's not a problem for tourists , there is n't any danger of it becoming violent , it 's not ukraine or syria . 
  the main problem as i see it with the bill is largely the fact that , for some bizarre reason , people with * suspended sentences * ( as in , not going to prison ) are also getting amnesty . . when supposedly this bill is being touted as reducing overpopulation in prisons ( which is a true problem ) . 
  then what is the case ? 
  why are they getting pregnant with these unwanted children ? 
  where is their contraception ? 
  again , i 'm all for abortions , but if you willfully had unprotected sex and are then `` oh gosh darn it , abort ! '', 
  - you 're uneducated . 
  it 's still lack of education - abortions can be damaging to your body , even if they 're accepted , it 's not something you just want to have willy nilly . 
  and i 'm talking purely from a pragmatic pov , i 'm not particularly convinced by arguments that having an abortion is immoral or `` wrong '' - you should just be using contraception in the first place and never get there . 
  sure there is , just like anywhere else in europe . 
  it 's the lack of education that leads to pregnancies . 
  interestingly enough , it was only like that since the late 60s , before that it was very open and the rate was ridiculously high , like 80 % + . . 
  it did result in a birth rate surge , but only for a short time before people found ways around it . 
  one wonders how many people will still be `` praising kek '' 2 years from now - when all you have is promises you 're free to dream and be hopeful , but then things actually have to be put into practice ... 
  when you have the kind of populist discourse trump does , the actual results will almost inevitably be disappointing . 
  in any case , short of anything really dramatic , we wo n't be seeing any big results until 1-2 years later . 
  good luck o /, 
  kind of rich coming from someone that is mad with fucking chemo patients and other people in extreme suffering getting a bit of relief . 
  wait what - they did n't allow phones and cameras in the louvre when i was there . . then again , that was in like 2007 .

  culturally could you really with a straight face say that the likes of tolstoy and dostoyevsky are * asian * writers ? 
  c'mon now really , i hate what the soviets were and disapprove of the current russian government too , but this kind of historical revisionism is stupid .

  i ca n't wait personally , the twitter meltdown during the impeachment will be amazing . 
   devolved to into an islamist socialist union . 
  whoa !, 
  news to me . . incidentally , did you hear about the 1000 muslims that burnt down a cathedral in koln ? 
  [ to be fair ] ( https://gazetadespania.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/lia-olguta-vasilescu.jpg ) , the lighting in that one is pretty unflattering . 
  then again , the woman on the left is probably half her age . 
  whenever you think about why powerful people will do something , you should ask a simple question : `` what money ( or power ) is there to be gained in doing x ? '', 
  so lets test it here : what $ $ $ is there to be made in turning what could be a large , lucrative and exploitable market with a huge population into a glass crater ? 
  dead people wo n't buy your shit - your megacorporations ca n't open up new chapters in smoking ruins - seems like a pretty shitty deal overall . 
  current population trends are hardly a good indicator for what will happen * generations from now * . 
  i seriously do n't know why you buy into this narrative that the birthrates of african migrants would remain unhindered across generations . 
  hell , we do n't even know what europe will be like 50 years from now - you know - just like if you would 've asked a european about it in 1967 , they would 've almost certainly been wrong . 
  by the way , most people do n't hate themselves , you should stop conflating stuff you read on the internet from vocal minorities with how the average person in a country feels . 
  it 's the same as thinking all trump supporters are / r/the _ donald trolls or all people who consider themselves feminists are like the shit you read on / r/tumblrinaction, 
  the robots already exist , and they do n't have to be ais to put millions of people out of jobs . 
  just think about everyone in the transportation industry being replaced by self driving vehicles - those already exist , today , and they 're already better than humans . 
  the benefits of replacing your truckers , taxi drivers and deliverymen with unblinking , tireless robots who do n't get stupid behind the wheel is undeniable . 
  obviously , not everyone will go at once , they 'll be replaced slowly , but it 's something we do have to think about ahead of time . 
  destruction of their nation , what ? 
  who ? 
  where ? 
  too much of that ` fake news ' maybe ? 
  as for making fun , riffing on nationality is a time-honored tradition , it , believe it or not , brings people closer together rather than dividing them . 
  if you think you 're being patriotic by getting defensive whenever someone makes a joke at your country 's expense , you 're hugely mistaken , try some self-deprecating humour every now and then , it will do you good to not take yourself so seriously all the time . 
  i also ca n't possibly conceive how you 'd think anyone in the eu wants to `` re-fight ww2 '' ( ?! ), 
  or fight any war at all - again - less breitbart , maybe ? 
   well , get ready for that cranked to 11 , on cocaine , with smaller hands and a shittier haircut . 
  the tweets . 
  the tweets will be glorious . 
  incidentally if you guys get someone else and put him in a replica oval office with just twitter access and aides indulging him , do you think that would work ? 
  you could even make a reality show !, 
  just fyi this kind of bellicose attitude is the kind of stuff people in europe usually do when they 're making caricatures of americans . 
  oh , and the whole hegemonic `` you exist only by our good graces '' is n't very much in the american spirit either , or is that only celebrated when it 's favourable to you ? 
  i know certain other places where he would 've been dead ten times over for the behaviour on display here . 
   a rise out of the leftists ironic , considering the history of the thing she was praising . 
  1 in romania , the refugee crisis simply is n't a subject . 
  a literal handful of refugees are housed somewhere out in the countryside and otherwise no one wants to come here since we do n't really have the opportunities for skilled workers or the welfare state for those who want a free ride . 
  if you ask the average person , i think they do n't want them here . 
  personally i have pretty mixed feelings - people from war torn countries should get help , but i also do n't want minorities that ca n't integrate living in enclaves ala belgium or france - if they do stay here , it should be temporary , when it 's safe again , they should go back and rebuild their own country . 
  2 i 've traveled around western europe some but i 'm a very unimaginative eater so i have n't tried any special local dishes , all i will say is that i ate better in germany than in france  3 romanian movies often have that typical eastern european depressing feeling about them , tackling subjects such as [ the corrupt and uncaring healthcare system ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456149/ ) or the [ `` golden age '' of romanian communism ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1032846/?ref_=nm_knf_i1 ) - they 're quite authentic , though . 
  i ca n't think of a lot of well translated books where the meaning or social context is n't lost on someone who is n't romanian or at least eastern euroepan , though . 
   it just says that the man ought to have the final say in many matters . 
  why ? 
  probably wo n't work - i 'd prefer an aggressive campaign that paints smoking as a ** stupid ** habit only indulged in by idiots and hoping it seeps enough into society that it becomes an `` uncool '' habit and those who do it are ostracized . 
  social ostracization is more powerful than any ban a government could ever impose . 
  most anti-smoking campaigns say its unhealthy - nope - that does n't work , people have a hard time understanding long term health effects . 
  tell them they 're morons or they 're not manly/feminine/patriotic / whatever if they do it though , hit their self esteem , that works better . 
  of course , older smokers will bitch and say they 're being persecuted but who cares ? 
  the lives and health of future potential smokers are more important , both to their families and to the government who wo n't have to pay for their lung cancers later . 
  you 're not permitted to use sidewalks , there are * some * cycling lanes , but mostly in parks and the likes . 
  you ca n't really get from point a to b on a bicycle without weaving through traffic . 
  it 's both horrifying and exciting to see the memefication of politics . 
  but then how will cyclists have an [ exciting commute ] ( https://youtu.be/lcsqzhrsohy?t=24s ) every day ? 
  you guys should take note from us instead . 
  if mr.asylum seeker was rejected by germany for being too dangerous/suspicious , why should one of us take him instead ? 
  from the article - `` how to proceed with rejected asylum seekers , including holding potentially more dangerous rejected asylum seekers seen as islamists in detention before they are deported . '', 
  this is about * rejected * asylum seekers , not quotas or regular refugees . 
  so really , why should romania , or poland or any other eastern eu country take these dangerous criminals ?

  now to the business side of things , you are an italian shirt manufacturer , you hate paying a solidarity tax , do you move to vietnam ? 
  no , because if it would have been economically reasonable to make such a move you would have already made it , with or without that solidarity tax , because that is a business the most efficient way to produce and sell something . 
  but lets say that nobody buys your shirts because they ca n't afford it , so you change your whole business plan and do move to vietnam ( witch will require a lot of money ) , does the italian economy suffer because of this ? , does the eu economy suffer ? , do your former competitors suffer ( maybe because of to much celebratory chianti ) , the only ones that suffer are your former employees but because they life on the civilised part of the atlantic they have unemployment , healthcare and probably little to no debt . 
  how can you even make such a paralel ? 
  we ( our auto industry ) had a big role in detroit 's downfall . 
  we can easily become more competitive , just hire people with vietnam level salaries , give corporations the freedom to completely destroy the environment like the us or we could just inject ridiculous amounts of money in the banking sector so they redistribute cheap money in the economy with very low recovery rates like china . 
  competitivity is not a goal , the well being of citizens is , we are already competitive on markets with high added value why strive for sectors that promote unhealthy growth models . 
  the eu because of its diversity , on average , withstood much better than china or the us in this financial crisis , it is easy to label the pigs as vulnerabilities but those are nothing compared to whole american industries that required bailouts . 
  one of the pillars of our crisis is the borrowing policy that the imf encouraged . 
  it 's like a heroin dealer criticizing a junkie for not having a job after he forced him into withdrawal . 
  i see a big difference between having a shrine in your house and celebrating christmas ( from a western perspective at least , so i maybe wrong ) . 
  in other news the imf urges europe to stop giving a fuck about workers and think about how difficult it is to be a banker or broker . 
  `` there 's your problem '', 
  yes but in this context it 's still a religious practice , compared to agnostics or atheists , is n't it ? 
  i have n't seen the actual papers up-close ( the censor insisted on a no touching policy ) but both times my censor and my cousin 's had a problem with the concept of non-religion being a valid response , it may very well be a lack of training or a personal grudge against secular people that both censors shared or a ( conspiracy alert ! ), 
  central directive , because when 30 % of the population says they believe in pizza more than god , you kinda have to start the debate over financing churches and priests from the public budget and that would n't go well with the church would maybe wo n't be very understanding come election time . 
  i know he should have argued but the context was more bang , bang - thank you ma'am , than that of a debate . 
  i think the estimate ( source : tv ) was 15 minutes per person , but with me the censor finished in 6 minutes in total with the argument over atheism as a valid religion , so only if you really insisted did the censor actually recorded your denomination right . 
  you 're thinking of actual religious practitioners , but think about how many adulterers or sleazeballs define themselves as religious just because they take part in religious rituals on holidays , weddings , baptisms of funerals . 
  i 'll give an example of the current ~ ~ referendum ~ ~ ( census ) where my cousin on the question of religious faith responded that he is agnostic , but guess what , there was n't a box with that option and the interviewer changed the question to : what religion was he baptised in , he responded orthodox and so a non-believer was marked as another willing tax payer that has his beliefs represented by the official church . 
  why is japans religiosity different ? 
  hanna-barbera cartoons by any chance ? 
  no they did n't , they circumvented the legal framework that sould n't be there in the first place , anyway arguing that either side sees the laws as more than obstacles is subjective partizanship . 
  this is the authority laws have in romania at this time and i personally prefer it to a stable form of autoritarian goverment where all the branches of goverment have one political colour and pluralism is inexistent , that is the structure iliescu and nastase put in place , from judicial , to local , in the timeframe of a presidential mandate , everything can be uniformed . 
  so there is no oposition and no questioning of the rulling power , add to this , the corrupt press and the reach of the secret services and you have a real life dystopia . 
  actually you 're might have something , oresharski 's mandate comes from the socialist party ( former communist party ) , that is not a member of the ppe, 
  everyone is epp , especially in eastern europe , i think they automatically accept you in when you become a political party . 
  but more to the point , ~ ~ gerb the ruling party in bulgaria , is also in the epp ~ ~ ( gerb is has the majority but lost the mandate to the socialists ) edit : actually oresharski is a representative of the socialist party , and not a member of epp, 
  yes it will , generation x is more fed up then you are , they where never trained to take over and control . 
  the only obstacle will be ignorance which all recent generation has in abundance . 
  but in general we speak the same post-existential language and we will change the world for the best . 
  time brings 2 inevitable forces more or less interconnected : social change and death . 
  we only have to avoid the latter until the first occurs . 
  wait for the death of the ' 60 's generation that has immense political and economical power compared to the rest of us . 
  after that there will be serious economical issues , that will have to be addressed , political and social roles will be redefined and all will be well . 
  you can not silence a generation that tasted freedom . 
  in the sort term , support the green party , the pirate party even right wing or anarchist party any marginalised party that is non traditional . 
  your vote wo n't be relevant , but it will register as a vote of opposition . 
  this is better in my opinion than not voting because it can not be trivialised as ignorance or disinterest in politics . 
  no , last year she picked the side of the government not the people , more detail would be romanian politics that are n't relevant to the case in hand . 
  good article op , and very detailed really worth reading . 
  the article has some interesting points i want to underline . 
  xenophobic culture does not generate votes for radical parties , this i think is more a manifestation of disappointment in traditional parties on the side of the electorate . 
  the established parties are homogeneous from the voters point of view on matters like immigration and national autonomy , this fuels nationalist fires that are ancestral for out continent , these in term give radicals a audience that make them news worthy . 
  i feel you 're pain , but as god-the protector dissipates from the collective mind and existential fears are amplified by tv tragedies . 
  political marketing comes to the rescue : exaggeratin anguish and then offering solutions at the low , low price of your independence and freedom . 
   do n't want to loose that porn site you love , still want to make terrorist jokes on facebook , do n't worry our fascist state comes with a payment plan in stages : your inert overstimulated technophilic mind wo n't even feel the payments , you 'll only realize the change when you 'll tell your children crazy stories about freedom of expression and unbiased opinions . 
   - ... and then there where websites where you could to see tv shows for free ...  - shut-up old man , you 're just high . 
   vote at the next election for the party of your choice and be proud you changed nothing !, 
  reading was against the romanian protests and the antigovernment measures that took place here a year and a half ago in romania so why the change of heart ? 
  i understand we do n't like non-eu europeans , but fences ? 
  give them a chance , i 'm sure non eu boar can be as tasty as its euro brethren . 
  actually it will increase rape and teenage pregnancies , but that 's beside the point . 
  the cause is always more important than the effect in these kind of moralising policies . 
  i fully agree , it is the classical touchy moral issue american politicians have used to created irrelevant debates that mask the fact there are no debates when it comes to privacy policies , economical measures or political diversity on complex subjects . 
  same here , but here the opposition would complain about how much it would cost , how many funds will be subverted or argue that the ruling party should have other priorities , and after the arguing , the tv shows and the corruption , you end up with 20 km of highway between `` nobody cares '' and `` nothing here '' that is inaugurated with celebrations and pride . 
  [ clarkson meets the neighbours ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pke1mqmjwg ), 
  hope it works out and southern and eastern countries copy your policy . 
  so the ruling party just said lets turbocharge the economy and build up our infrastructure because it 's the right ting to do ? 
  * the atom thing in brussels * your prime minister is gay * leopold was worst than hitler but not for whites so history does n't really care * for some reason you ca n't get along with your fellow belgian if he is speaking another language but you do n't want to spit up the country * you have weird sports ( clarkson video ) * you have a new generation of football players that play really beautiful soccer ( national team ) * you had some great renaissance painters * your famous for waffles and chocolate but i do n't really care about them , but your beer has a special place in my heart * the 24 hour race at spa * antwerp is a beautiful city * and jean claude van damme, 
  oh ... you swiss with your common sense and logic that 's not how we do it here in the rest of the continent , we have pride , historical anguish and dick measuring contests between former imperialists to define our borders . 
  no austerity for you guys , i guess . 
  are there elections in the foreseeable future or is this a thing all your parties agreed upon ? 
  easier access to our markets for established companies from your countries . 
  our government incompetence makes it very profitable ( preferential tax rates ) to build ( or buy ) a factory here , we have a qualified work force working for pennies compared with a worker of similar qualification from your country and logistical and managerial costs are a fraction of what it would cost if that factory would be on another continent . 
  our consumer markets are also very valuable , we are uneducated consumers , legislation and government supervision is appalling , spending power is on the rise and our local companies lack the resources to be a serious threat . 
  from a geopolitical point of view , in a world where continent-nations are the main players , germany , france , spain , italy and co. would have ended up becoming second hand players , simple backers of us policies , without the backing of a whole continent . 
  how roman of him , * the italian peninsula , keeping the rich comfortable since 500 b.c. 
  true , but the same can be said about your country not being iraq . 
  i made a brief comparison ( [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_military_expenditures ) ) the us spends 300 times more than iraq and russia spends 180 times more than you do . 
  of course there are other factors like technology , geopolitical alliances on one hand and proximity and man power on the other . 
  my point still stands the gap between big and small countries is so big that arms races are a very ineffective means of defence for small countries . 
  to reiterate my problem , small countries are encouraged to spend money on foreign weapons ( buying cost , maintenance and training ) , we spend money on an ineffective army while the big guys military industries benefit from our faulty short term policies . 
  i do n't have a lot of praise for the ussr but at least they gave technology and encourage local military development . 
  this creates economic benefits not just geopolitical benefits . 
  it 's realistic , but besides those who now have a voice i see people that whant more want a better country , but do not dare to hope , if they would use / r/romania a fraction of how much they use fb , that hope would reignite and burn the silence and complacency , i see `` tzarani '' on a daily basis to , but i see a lot of decent people to , and the internet is the only way they can communicate . 
  when i say blog post i do not mean a journalists blog or a `` bloggarash '' i mean decent 10 hour a day worker that just spills his everyday frustrations ( because he grew up with the internet ) , i mean the housewife that posts recipes , that is the level where change can happen , when everyone has a voice , people who really have something to say will be behind movements not frustrated students or news outlets . 
  i bet you heard a lot about web 2.0 but that 's marketing bullshit , that has n't happen yet in our country , but it will , slowly , it will . 
   as for `` socially immoral : '' the cost of a military i was just saying in a extreme case that you would spend 40 % -50 % of your government budget on armament . 
  i understant the logic of halting back a invasion , but unless those armored vehicles are hidden , they will be gone after the initial air strike . 
  what i am trying to say is that in a modern war a small countries army can do little to nothing if threatened by a powerful enemy . 
  most american casualties where made in the occupational phase , not during the invasion and iraq had the money and the resources to put up a fight . 
  i understand very well where you 're coming from . 
  but the internet has illuminated more minds than the printing press , it the best weapon humanity has against ignorance , a well written blog post can change more minds that any individual in the real world going from person to person . 
  we can not force people to be smarter we can only offer options and let them choose what is right , as i and i believe you have done in the past . 
  nobody is borne literate , but everyone is curious let that curiosity guide them . 
  of course a lot of minds will stray in conspiracy theories and twerk videos but most will not and for those we should be tolerant of idiots commenting on youtube and strive to have more people with internet acces . 
  you ca n't spend enough , it is financially impossible and socially immoral to spend all of you budget on your army . 
  if all of the eastern block would have a unified army budget it will still be a fraction of what russia spends . 
  well with this logic why cure aids , its only gon na save africans . 
  funny how progress is only wanted if you get to benefit . 
  the iraq war was more conventional ( the smaller side had a chance ) than the invasion of georgia , that was just russia flexing and proving that germans care more about warm homes than dead easterners . 
   superior military force also have families , and mothers crying over their dead children in a war i would love that to be a reason , but reality has shown us time and time again it is not a deterrent , national propaganda and the illusion of military courage make any military action seem not only justified , but encouraged by the public . 
  it is a sad and twisted fact that we still consider dying in a war of aggression an act of courage . 
  by all means you have great reasons to maintain a modern up to date army , but should the money be spent on a national army vs a regional one ? 
  or is n't it better to buy technology rather than weapons , so that your own economy can reap some benefits ? 
  i am just commenting what i think my own country military policy should be . 
  this is exactly what i mean , an army is the most expensive way to defend yourself at this time . 
  how active is the eastern bear ? 
  diplomatic comments or are they acting like it 's still 1989 `` in democratic russia we defend your democracy from your people '' ?

  hungary is also better positioned geographically and that is seen in how developed gyor-moson-sopron county is ( relative to the other areas ) . 
  i really hope a new movement can be formed on the left . 
  i had hopes in milla or lmp but i really dislike schiffer and they do n't have a message outside of bp anyway . 
  something needs to change drastically though . 
  i used to admire hungary for the way it protested against authority , for 1956 etc. 
  last big protests were against the internet tax but orban was fast to respond to that . 
  nowadays it is indeed the other way around , romania has the chance to change , slowly civic participation grows ( far from healthy levels still ) while hungarians are resigned and say `` all politicians are the same '' ( i heard this thing from hungarians too many damn times ) . 
  it is also a more conservative society , anchored in the past , while romanians shun romania and there is more ground for change . 
  overall , romania has a very long way to go but there are premises for it succeeding while right now ( for the first time ) i am more pessimist in regards to hungary . 
  all this happens while hungary gets the most eu funds per capita ( i think hungary gets just as many funds as romania which has double the population and is even poorer ) while the elite talks about the decadence of the west and new models in turkey ( ok , that was two years ago i think but still ) . 
  romania has many challenges and i am not sure it will overcome them . 
  infrastructure is piss-poor , the country is heavily rural ( 47 % i think ) and most of the people are socially conservative and resistant to change ( however , the urban middle class is not , it is more progressive than in . hu ) . 
  there is a lot of resistance though and there is a constant battle . 
  off-topic : budpest  bucharest in most senses and will remain so in the foreseeable future . 
  quality of life is better in western romania than it is in eastern hungary but eastern romania is on another level completely ( mostly because of piss-poor policies for that area ) . 
  greetings from nagyvarad !, 
  i was just discussing with someone yesterday the mnb scandal ... it is so big , unprecedented in size and arrogance , it 's mindblowing . 
  but i sense resignation in the public 's eye more than ever . 
  it is absolutely the worst government hungary had and they rigged the system in their favour and at best a few hundred people will protest it in budapest . 
  i am sad . 
  it was a realization that hungary 's spirit dies inside . 
  [ 7 % ] ( http://www.stiripesurse.ro/sondaj-in-sectorul-1-care-e-diferen-a-dintre-pnl-i-psd-i-cine-ofera-surpriza-document_992201.html ) though i am unsure how reliable that is . 
  not many polls were conducted since not all candidates were known until very lately . 
  infrastructure can be very bad - horrible even . 
  we made once the unwise decision to cross the border at halmeu . 
  from there until berehove we made one and half hours although there were only 40 km . 
  the car was very sorry ( however from mukachevo to lviv it was quite good ) . 
  cities are more vibrant in ukraine in a way and i love their atmosphere but this may have to do with the lack of sizeable cities in romania ( cluj in ro has only 330k population while lviv for example has over 700k and it is only the 7th largest city there ) . 
  human rights is a bigger issue there and i know these because i stayed there at a human rights activist . 
  as very bad as romania is in terms of lgbt rights , ukraine is so so much worse . 
  and romania is one ( if not the ) worst countries in the eu in that regards . 
  kiev is a much more hipster city than bucharest is and in my very personal experience food is better in kyiv overall . 
  urbanistically ukrainian cities are more monumental , very high-rise brutalist flats everywhere . 
  upkeep is even worse although lviv , ivano-frankivsk and to a certain extent chernivtsi are ok . public transportation is very bad , i did not dare to use buses in most cities . 
  in kyiv i had to use the metro and it is very overcrowded ( infrastructure is very bad in kyiv as well ) . 
  very anecdotal but i have been four times in taxis there ( all the times in kiev ) and the drivers listened to great music all the times !, 
  it has to be said that the taxis did not have taxi signs and my friend called a number and they told what type/colour car to expect in x minutes . 
  it was sorta illegal i guess . 
  did not have to do with it personally but hospitals are generally even worse and just as corrupt . 
  my friends ' dad had to have surgery but at the same time he was drafted ( he was a reserve ) . 
  in order to have his surgery and get a paper that he is unable to join the military actively he had to bribe 800 euros . 
  i think he negotiated this sum afterwards . 
  his salary in euros was 70 !, 
  per month . 
  he needed some pills after the surgery and it would have cost him 180 euro . 
  i bought them from romania for 140 lei ( that 's about 34 euro ? ) . 
  ukrainian sweets  hungarian sweets  romanian sweets ( what you find generally in a shop ) . 
  1/3 or a bit less is the case in romania . 
  while i am not an expert on ukraine , but traveled there a lot and love that country . 
  it should be way higher than 1/3 . 
  for what it 's worth , i know an aussie who moved to leipzig because it is the new hip place , but this is very anecdotal, 
  and i said that because of the higher consumption , the trade deficit grows larger . 
  does n't have to do with the gdp . 
  the issue is that it is based mainly on consumption that is due to the lower taxes . 
  consumption of mainly imported products so the trade deficit goes way up . 
  on another hand , it is possible that this year the deficit of the budget will be over 3 % , but it is very possible to hit that mark next year . 
  all in all , the growth is relatively good but it is not done on the most solid ground . 
  kinda proves my point , no ? 
  banat-transilvania is the most favorable as it is shown in your graph as well . 
  yes , the differences are not that dramatic , but they certainly exist . 
  oh , the case of the deva castle is bad , i agree . 
  it is not the case with the oradea fortress where its history is highlighted although its recent history is highlighted a bit more than its importance in an exhibition . 
  case by case . 
  in regards to szekely symbols , well , that is a long discussion and i have diverging opinions ( do n't get me started on the relevancy of the alphabet that is displayed in every second town of hungary i enter ) . 
  and the szekely flag is quite a new , artificial and heavily politicized concept as well but i will not dwell in that discussion further . 
  that is part of the thing as well . 
  on the other hand the way anti-corruption charges against rmdsz/udmr politicians is reported on is biased as the source of the information is rmdsz politicians themselves who love to victimize themselves ( [ see here ] ( http://www.maszol.ro/index.php/belfold/60357-az-rmdsz-kiall-antal-arpad-polgarmester-mellett ) - btw he is corrupt as fuck , even some friends from my local rmdsz know this and talk openly about this in private ) . 
  another article with him [ here ] ( http://www.rmdsz.ro/sajtoszoba/hir/antal-elszabadul-a-magyarellenes-pokol-ha-december-9-e-utan-nem-eros-a-magyar-kepviselet ) then there are the cringey conspiracy theorists like [ this one ] ( http://www.titkolthirek.hu/magyarellenes-apartheid-romaniaban-osszefoglalo/ ) but you can find lunatics like that in ro as well and they are the minority overall in both cases . 
  two balanced reports are [ here ] ( http://vs.hu/kozelet/osszes/meghogy-harc-a-korrupcio-ellen-akkor-nezze-meg-mi-megy-odaat-0330#!s0 ) and [ here ] ( http://www.origo.hu/nagyvilag/20150129-mi-allhat-a-romaniai-magyarok-elitelese-mogott.html ) sorry , all links in hungarian . 
  i intended the second part of this post not in reply to you ( hello my fellow oradea redditor ) but to hungarian redditors . 
  i would just like to add on the romanian leadership is n't particularly nice to the hungarian community . 
  before doing that , i would add that i hold double citizenship and lived both in budapest and romania ( oradea or nagyvarad ) and of course i am fluent in both languages and read the press in both countries . 
  while i agree there are some politicians who are hungarophobic ( ex-minister of defence in ro and an extremist diaconu etc ) it is nowhere near as bad as it is portrayed in the hungarian ( right-wing ) media ( but sometimes even index or origo exaggerates it ) . 
  what really makes me get nervous is the way anti-corruption is portrayed in romania . 
  when there is reporting about the ex-pm being jailed on corruption charges it is mainly portrayed normally ... that romania is a very corrupt country etc etc. 
  when a udmr/rmdsz politician is being charged it is an attack on the hungarian minority hurr-durr ... and then i get a headache . 
  ( fyi , the rmdsz is very corrupt and the people who were charged were long due to be imprisoned ) . 
  for romanians i would like to add that while udmr is very corrupt , it is there where i found most nice politicians as well and percentage-wise it may be the party where the most not-corrupt politicians are , especially at local levels . 
  but the leadership is rotten . 
  anti-hungarian sentiment lies in the areas where there is no hungarian minority ( especially southern romania ) and it is stupid and not a lot is done to combat it by education etc. 
  history is quite one-sided in both countries ( romania has lots of shit about mihai viteazul and the dacs but then hungarian history books have a wild imagination as well - ca n't single out now things as i only once read a history book in hungary but my general impression was not good . 
  overall in transylvania things are ok . you will get the occasional romanian extremist as you will get the occasional hungarian extremist as well . 
  but overall lots of mixed families and lots of communities living in harmony . 
  i 'm saddened to hear this . 
  she was one of my favorite architects !, 
  she will be missed, 
  there are but many prefer to circlejerk about how us is the land of gun , violence and trump . 
  anybody who researched a bit about the us knows its many advantages . 
  i considered moving there and starting my business there as it is much easier and even people are much more open than here . 
  objectively i think i would really dislike the car-centric culture only ( though i know big cities are not very car-centric either ), 
  go to barcelona or go to bologna , firenze , ligurian coast . 
  go see salzburg , bavaria and even the neuschwanstein castle than go on the romantic road in germany . 
  go to prague , budapest or the adriatic coast in croatia . 
  go to lyon , strasbourg , biarritz , san sebastian ( current european cultural capital with wroclaw ) and you will have a wonderful time . 
  hell , i considered buying a ticket to belgium just yesterday and believe me , i love safe places ( ghent and brugge are amazing , brussels anyway is not ), 
  are you sure about that information in the first place ? 
  a muslim having security passes for a nuclear plant . 
  did you check his identity and found out he is a muslim ? 
  ( not even islamist , that would have been ok to say ) . 
  secondly , security measures can be updated if there is a danger , passes can be updated too .

  i was wondering why we 'd been so silent . . 
  a couple months ago id have said we need to spend maybe a little more just to pick up the slack from possible usa reductions . 
  i never really thought russia would do what it 's doing , and now i feel a bit foolish thinking we were living in a new world with new paradigms . 
  the `` old '' power structures and power games are still in place , the old spheres of influence persist in a very real way . 
  and i still feel weird saying it , but i think its time to increase spending , joint training , joint planning , and battlegroup scope across europe/eu . 
  and his victims didnt ? 
  is that the point ? 
  is that the basis question that we 're going to administer justice by ? 
  not a good one . . 
  it is the atlantic after all, 
  this could be the basis for a monty python sketch . . 
  thank you . 
  this is worrying , and also awesome ... but can anyone , maybe local , comment how legitimate this is , or what real weight it carries ? 
  was there actually a vote in this regional parliament though ? 
  all i `` m seeing is statements by an `` executive committee '', 
  this is probably the best way forward for `` europe '' in all its possible definitions . . are there any actually informative articles on this though ? 
  any studies ? 
  subbed !, 
  thanks, 
  this is really cool . 
  we should make a series out of this . 
  pls no,

  why are you skipping bulgaria and romania ? 
  y u feed trol, 
  did you look at airbnb or vrbo ? 
   there was zero russian politicians or diplomats on the pro-russian or pro-government protests . 
  that may be true , but i hope you 're not so naive as to think russia is not deeply meddling at full strength in ukraine 's affairs, 
  yes . 
  seems like its nothing , 4 years , for all the misery this single human being has caused . 
  but man , the way romania is right now , the things its struggling with . . 
  i have to say i 'm impressed he even got 4 years . 
  i do n't know how the hell it happened . 
  cheers .

  thank you for remapping . . much clearer,

  i doubt it 'll decrease illegal immigration or increase security, 
  ship em over , i 'll reimburse you for the shipping , ya miser, 
  romania ! = bucharest . 
  there are about 20 million people in romania that do n't live in bucharest . 
  this is great and all , but mostly symbolic since russia has not been the main trading partner for moldova . . the eu replaced it a while ago . 
  hopefully we see some more concrete and effective moves from the eu to improve moldovas lot and bring them in the fray . 
  they will be easier to handle than romania , if only because its smaller . 
  gypsies ! = romanians, 
  list them, 
  this guy . . 
  this is more than a difference in electoral geography though, 
  a war like that one , but in ukrainian territory , would result in world war 3 . . lets hope it does n't get there, 
  the birth of two nations, 
  eastern europe unfriendly ? 
  wtf ? 
  this list is total bullshit, 
  yes but not in its current state , i do n't know if it 's possible . 
  the very sizable russian population / homogeneous territory will be very problematic to deal with and integrate . . and before even that , i dont believe the ethnic russians would accept accession . 
  so maybe the country will have to partition itself , which is a very messy and unpleasant subject . 
  why the * & $ * % & * did they ditch sibiu-pitesti ? 
  i include romania in both the balkan and not fully ready groups, 
  another day , another proof the balkan countries are not fully ready to be part of europe, 
  time to resurrect tepes, 
  good luck neighbors , i wish you all the best . 
  be angry but be safe . 
  why are you so upset man ? 
  well that 's a nice thing to say . 
  thanks buddy !, 
  have a good weekend . 
  its time we change this date to be called `` international butthurt hungarians crying on the internet '' day . 
  gib more tears pls, 
  `` defiantly '', 
  sorry but i do n't really see how else you can present this . 
  it may be antirussian propaganda but its also the truth . 
  they did many horrible things , everyone did , and this is one of them . 
  they 're mad at france 's 3 - 0 comeback . . 
  ujelly, 
  hell no . 
  greece , romania , bulgaria , italy , spain , etc. . . all of these terribly problematic and costly countries are not enough ? 
  we need to bring in gargantuan one named ukraine ? 
  as an idea its a little better than bringing turkey in ... not by much . 
  before we go in bringing countries close to the bloc we need to focus on cleaning up the house . 
  we just do n't want russia to `` have '' them . . 
  someone snorted angrypowder today, 
  romania not last !, 
  not even second last !,

  hence the threat in the article . 
  your first phrase and your second phrase make no sense put together in the context of this article , 
  there used to be a time when brits would have laughed it off . 
  whatever the fuck happen to your sense of humor ? 
  see , more proof that going close to us changes nations for the worst, 
  well , it 's a situation which kind of demands condescension, 
  not as much puppets as you , for one very simple reason : we do it to gain something . 
  in romania 's case we do it to gain military contracts for the weaponry industry , support for our candidacy to join in nato and lately visa waivers and coverage of the anti-defense shield . 
  it 's a tit-for-tat . 
  you on the other hand had nothing to gain . 
  hey , brits , your master does n't want to lose it 's puppet inside eu and has started cracking her whip . 
  yes, 
  i am so looking forward to merkel explaining why turkey 's place is in the eu ... 
  better soundbite, 
   we look at them , and if they 're sick or if they 're injured and obviously ca n't go on the flight , then we take them to the doctor and have them examined and  and the scenes can turn ugly at the airport , as berlin lawyer oda jentsch knows . 
  `` there are a lot of cases where the deportation simply ca n't be carried out by force , '' said jentsch , who represents many asylum seekers . 
  `` there are cases when the airline has company guidelines that say they ca n't have people on board who did n't get on voluntarily . 
  and then there are cases where the person actively resists - they scream , they throw themselves to the floor , they wo n't let themselves be transported . 
  and that often means that the deportation ca n't happen . '', 
  how the hell did you know this is going to happen ? 
  you had exactly the same thing happening with the gypsies not that long ago . 
  to the point where they were mutilating and injuring themselves so they will delay the procedures . 
  do the german asylum authorities and the german police have a gold-fish memory that only spans 3 seconds ? 
  wan na know what 's going to happen next ? 
  the soon-to-be-deported will band together and you will see riots . 
  because they have nothing to lose ... and unlike the gypsies , who were maybe 20 at a time , these migrants in the thousands . 
  better stock up on toilet paper , dudes , 'cause shitty times are coming ... 
  i wonder of the german company that would not sell wire fences to hungary will do the same for austria . 
  so there 's another way to calculate contribution to the social security budget other than based on salary and deducting the costs associated ? 
  do tell !, 
  you are not going to get an increase in productivity . 
  nor will the demand for goods be significant or of the right nature to count as a positive economy . 
  1 . to get an apartment you need a shitload of money . 
  most migrants are unskilled or low skilled . 
  the chances for the first generation to qualify both in terms of loans and in terms of income for a new house are slim to none . 
  the demand will not be as great as you assume . 
  it will just generate an extra-pressure on the renting market and increase in costs there ... for everybody involved . 
  cars = i doubt they will rely on new cars ( income again ) . 
  i expect there will be a better absorption of 2nd and 3rd hand cars on the local market ( which now go towards eastern europe and russia ) . 
  best case scenario they will buy cheap dacia or skoda cars -  money going out from your economy ( at least this will stay in europe ) 3 . 
  food -  mostly will come from imports . 
  it will also create a further depression of the local food markets because of the needed influx of cheaper food . 
  this translate into bad things for the agriculture sector . 
  while this can be cushioned to some extend by the influx of cheap labour , what about the germans working currently in that field ? 
  where will they go ? 
  what about the current non-german occupants of those jobs ? 
  what will happen to them ? 
  that speaking about the moral implications 4 . 
  clothing -  every piece of clothing made in eu is at least half made in china . 
  that means a further imbalance in the import/export trade . 
  most of those money will leave eu . 
  so in the long term we are looking at a marginal increase in productivity . 
  but in the short ( and long ) term we are looking at accentuated trade imbalance and massive flow of money from the inside the eu economy to outside ( both for trade and simply put money sent out by the migrants to the country of origin ) . 
  it all comes down to math , and merkel & the leftist gang 's math is shit . 
  the facts are these : 1 . the majority of migrants come in are under-skilled by comparison with eu workers even for the skilled jobs they claim to have . 
  most are unskilled workers . 
  i think on average we can consider their net salary to be at least 1/3 lower than a native european simply because it 's skewed towards the lower salaries because most are unskilled workers . 
  this means low wages , low wages in turn means lower taxes & social contributions to pensions paid . 
  let 's call this x. 
  it takes at least 6 months for their application to be processed , the money for their maintenance will come from the social security budget . 
  yes , the same one where pensions come from . 
  so deduce that from their lifetime contribution to said fund after they get a job . 
  they will bring in dependents . 
  either by cultural specific ( a large portion of women are forbidden to work ) or by biology ( children ) . 
  deduct their lifetime contribution . 
  it takes at least 1 year to learn the language and for most to get skill levels up to par for the western labour market . 
  deduct the cost tutoring and living for that year from their lifetime contribution . 
  a fair number will not integrate but add to the `` perpetual '' unemployed or to the black market labor which does not generate taxes . 
  m4 the leftist theory says that migrants will be `` paying '' the pensions of an aging european population contribution . 
  the current average european contribution can not cover the current pension system needs . 
  please explain to me how the tax percentage of [ x - ( m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 ) ] will be able to be higher than the current average european contribution . 
  much higher if you take into account that the pension system will need more money than now . 
  calculate x for that to work . 
  now think how probable is for a migrant to be earning x. 
  mars ... 
  yep , stick you head in the ground . 
  i am pretty sure if you go just a little deeper you 'll will come up in australia . 
  so where do you think they went ? 
  of course they do . 
  they do n't stand a chance to be granted asylum . 
  they have disappeared into the vast illegal work system which exists in germany and everybody pretends it does n't . 
  potatoes should not be used for chips . 
  they should only be used to make the holy vodka ... 
  i am ok with that , but i really do n't see the reason why this has been turned into a continent-level therapy session . 
  not sure if you spend time on / r/romania but that is what this guy does over there as well ( among other things ) ... 
  he is also impervious to any kind of logical argumentation ... 
  lies , damn lies and more lies to top it off . 
  just like the source of the article ... you could almost think you were working for them  you also let out that gen. voinea was also investigated by kovesi and that the charges had nothing to do with this particular matter . 
  but hey a lie by omission is not a lie , right ? 
  yeah , actually , it is ... 
  i love you giving links to what your `` guys '' say about the guy investigating their boss . 
  because that is how impartiality looks like . 
  oh , and the `` political police '' claim is just adorable . 
  it 's not like is what every single one of the politicians who was ever convicted and under indictment claims , regardless of political color . 
  maybe there 's a third group there doing the politics that we are not aware of . 
  because that is why several foreign officials , including ambassadors , prosecutors , etc. 
  have shown their unmitigated support for kovesi and morar work ... because they are from countries who do n't have a local presence and investigative capabilities ( such as ... you know , usa , france and germany ) so they are totally un-aware those guys are involved in doing `` political police '' . 
  totally dude !, 
   they were unjustly made to pay 60,000 because they have shown irrefutable proof no , it 's because they claimed ( just like you did ) without a single shred of evidence other than word diarrhea that she intervened in the case . 
  you did exactly the same , you linked to some case and made a claim without the proof .

  politicians peddle the extremes to gain sturdy support as well as acknowledgement through negative or positive media . 
  as every broken clock is right twice a day , a lot of broken clocks which form the governments of the world tend to tell the right time , separately . 
  it 's the hour of orban and no one is laughing cause his ordinarily broken view now aligns with europe 's needs . 
  this does n't mean he 's reliable for any other circumstances . 
  lol , yeah that was a bit out of my league . 
  thanks for the explanation [ haha ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dmn4waa.png ), 
  20k sounds like a reasonable number of people to process , monitor and detain if need-be . 
  j edgar hoover 's fbi dealt with far more commies wanting to turn the us into a red state and while his methods were controversial , they worked . 
  i 'm sure there are people who are better paid to think of things like this who have much sharper teeth toward the problem , being held back by politicians with clouds in their heads . 
  http://uk.businessinsider.com/viktor-orban-interview-refugee-migrant-hungary-2016-2 http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/03/hungary-border-war-refugees-160329102030588.html he did n't exactly * solve * anything but he did have the right idea of * actually resisting the entitled shits making their way across our continent * and setting up posts to process the ones actually requiring asylum . 
  i do n't believe we should dismiss pages out of anyone 's book . 
  nobody is a saint and all national policies are refined from past rulers who were just as bloodthirsty if not more-so . 
  just make sure to grab the right pages , an easy test is if they abide by the [ golden rule ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_rule ) . 
   especially on coastal borders . 
  sharks , breed sharks and ban fishing them in the mediterranean . 
  were n't most of those terrorists people who were arrested or/and monitored ? 
  the police simply let them go after a little while being detained . 
  does that sound like reasonable policy toward your own nationals being treasonous ? 
   your brother is n't turkey at war with some of the peeps in syria & general daesh area ? 
   catch them all put pokemon on every refugee ? 
  :d but seriously , if this was 100 years ago you 'd have a standing army corralling the people into a designated area with a non-nonsense policy toward all their entitlements . 
  as sad as it is to say this : hitler actually would 've handled the migrant problem infinitely better . 
  if only he had n't been so pro-death , xenophobia and genocide . 
  last i checked hungary 's orban got a lot of bonus points back home on his `` no bullshit , protect the eu border '' policy toward migrants , even though he was initially scolded in the media . 
  it 's strange living in a world where leaders are polarized into blank thinking categories instead of common sense and flexible approaches . 
  if edrogan would n't order executions and treat his enemies humanely , he might actually be beneficial for turkey as far as i know ( which is not a lot but i 'm at least skeptical of the general message of `` he 's hitler # 2 '' ) . 
  it 's a pretty nice flag . 
  i 've read that opinion quite a lot lately but i see no honesty or realism in it . 
  even if turkey would be an eu member i fail to see how the middle east would possibly be stabilized because of this . 
  judging by most of the dialogue on the issue of refugees , i consider most would like the eu border to be in turkey so that we 'd have a firm ground barrier through which desperate people could n't just flood in like they did with the mediterranean , which sort-of makes sense but is far from the idea of providing any genuine help to the middle east . 
  eu also looks pussyfooted imo due to their previous mismanagement of migrants and lack of dialogue + consensus on concerted efforts to contain the population instead of dispersing it , which they 're doing on their own . 
  having non-residents walking free ( no supervision and processing ) across eu territory is an unacceptable show of weakness . 
  i would n't call eu sickly , more like `` pussyfooted '' . 
  and it 's british !, 
  who 'd have thought . . 
  you 're right . 
  we should just arm european nations ' militaries again . 
  except this time the western powers learned their lesson from history and will have proper means of response . 
  r-right guys . . guys ? 
  it would look as justinian had made it , original . 
  nice try , skynet . 
  but that 's exactly what happened in europe before the renaissance , / u/spiderfnjerusalem, 
   a false flag operation there 's no doubt of that at this point . 
   constantinople too long . 
  renamed to byzantium and given greece and macedonia for keeps !, 
  he was n't * that * bad , he did kill hitler after all . 
  nobody did stalin that favor . 
  yey us and eu . 
  here 's to not destroying this universe anytime soon !, 
   if you want to take a look at how that could play out , look at saddam hussein as much as saddam did some crazy shit , he held back the torrent of nutjobs now running amok in the middle east . 
  maybe that 's just the proper way of dealing with the muslim populace until they achieve enlightenment ? 
  united states of capital punishment, 
   shittertown in the highlands where you have just sheep and no internet and have an opinion about great britain . 
  goddamn right , lad !, 
  where do you think brexit voters hail from ? 
  the more educated they are , the more like they do this . 
  everyone else though ... 
  ah , the reddit method . 
  well played . 
  then there 's the spread of lies like the nhs getting removed . 
  british people are * very * protective of the health system made after ww2 and for good reason . 
   as if allah feeds and houses them . 
  brilliant !, 
  let 's make this the default policy : give them nothing from infidel resources and have allah keep them . 
  they were very unlucky as well , many balls just strolling past or thumbling around . 
  just was n't their day . 
  i do n't know what standards spanish it guys have but for ro 220000 $ is a shitton of money . 
  define : low . 
  why do n't they just train them ? 
  obviously the smaller companies possibly do n't have the means of doing this but the medium-large ones could promote an in-house internship/training program to make batches of new and most likely loyal employees . 
  aye , thanks brittish lads for all this popcorn material . 
  way to sock it to the man !, 
   when you walk around with a fucking israel tag . 
  maybe it 's bait ? 
  honestly , i get the sentiment as just affirming identity of self and i can see why they would want it so i do n't exactly mind you guys not being in the gang . 
  it 's a shame it just was n't expressed in the best way but i suppose that would n't have gotten enough steam for the polls or butthurt for the news . 
  ca n't stop the power of love !, 
  step 7 . 
  [ blame the jews !, 
  so your argument is they 're not popular enough ? 
  that has hardly to do with being `` complicated and bloated '' as was your initial assessment . 
  to put it simply : my country has a ton of well known officials because of all the corruption and scandals surrounding them . 
  to be well known is the mark of a corrupt man and the ones who are doing their jobs perfectly are usually the most obiquitous . 
  you 're not supposed to give a shit about the people who work for you from high up in governments , you should care about the decisions they make and how easy they are to reach . 
  at least , that 's my take on it . 
  romania unfortunately has a lot of experience with untrustworthy and shitty officials . 
  obviously , according to the op link , not as much as finland . 
   i support parliamentary democracies when they are supported by the people ** of england . 
  ** ftfy . 
  everyone 's just one google search away from looking up exactly what makes the eu a bunch of representative institutions where elected officials appoint additional staff to make concerted decisions yet they can only parrot what the brexit movie told them : that the commissioners are gods and they 're accountable to no one and have no oversight or mandate . 
  you not only * can * but that 's usually what happens when * acting * on stupidity . 
  literally everything i can think of from wildlife circumstances to any human affair , acting by stupidity comes at a cost - which is punishment when paid toward another party . 
  it 's a logical and natural part of correcting behaviour . 
  it does n't mean there 's necessarily ill will behind it and it should always be a proportional response . 
  yeah , it is simply the most immediate implication one can derive from their desires faced with this demand and recent actions . 
   on the other hand have nothing against indians/pakistani/bangladesh people maybe they do but they have another level of guilt which impedes them from speaking their minds , namely the former colony status . 
   this is great and yet , it 's * little * . 
  i think it 's cause they did n't hit a deadline yet and nobody 's made any hard decisions so they can afford to clown around in their house and make-up some form of response eventually . 
  you wo n't see any fireworks until that happens . 
  if you go into a random pub and yell the kind of rubbish farage is talking toward that pub 's clientelle , you 're likely to be hoisted out .

  do n't worry , that 's their exact attitude towards hungarians . 
  they have no idea how condescending they sound . 
  yes , we do . 
  was n't it recently updated ? 
  i used it last year and it was pretty sleek . 
  so you blame the failings of the uk political system on the eu . 
  why is that ? 
  you do know that colonialism was still a thing in the 20th century , right ? 
  and the eu began in the aftermath of ww2 and still continues to this day , ensuring probably the longest period of peace in europe , since ever . 
  the scottish would disagree . 
  what exactly are you implying with this ? 
  all i said was that the snp could make a legitimate case for a new referendum , and since the populace could be easily convinced that something bad happened to them as a result of westminster 's actions , the independence camp could win this time . 
  ergo , it would lead to the break-up of the uk , as the article suggests . 
  maybe , but the snp will have real momentum behind them if they can convince the population that westminster took them out of the union against their will . 
  what do you mean slovak and hungarian ? 
  they are very different languages , or am i misinterpreting what you said ? 
  transylvania used to be a country , unlike rahova , which is a neighbourhood in bucharest . 
  not slav , but from the same region . 
  basically , yeah . 
  so what you 're saying is that mistakes of the past justify mistakes in the future ? 
  yes , we all know by know . 
  i 'd love to hear from the other side for once . 
  italy ? 
  the balkans ? 
  hungary ? 
  there 's lots of variety in european cuisine that most people are not aware of . 
  now i feel bad :(, 
  oh , okay then . 
  i 'll be honest and say that nothing really comes to mind when thinking of scandinavian food other than meatballs , lots of fish and blood pudding , sooo yeah ... 
   noone comes here oh sure , except the 4.4 million tourists that visit budapest every year , making it the 6th most popular destination in europe . 
  yeah , that totally does n't count . 
   food is usually not good i will take this opportunity to disagree with you . 
  how is european cuisine not good ? 
  your username is fitting , to say the least . 
  i 'm basing this on my own experience , and i have lots of it , some of it is my own , most of it is of other people 's . 
  i regularly interact with the romanian community in scotland , so i think i have a better idea than most of what it 's like . 
  european cultures in general are extremely similar to each other , and i 'm saying this because i 've had my first ever culture shock in asia ( and i 've visited the philippines as well ) , but never in europe . 
  i think i speak english well enough to get by and that was just as true on my first day of being here . 
  i encourage you to visit central and eastern europe , so that you can see for yourself , maybe you 'll be surprised . 
  it 's not a fair point . 
  i 'm tired of this sub pushing the `` we 're oh so different '' mentality . 
  that 's stupid . 
  someone from romania is decidedly not as different from a cultural standpoint as someone from the philippines , and i would be willing to bet that if you saw a romanian walking down the street , more often than not , you would n't be able to tell that they 're not british without talking to them first . 
  i 'm actually romanian ( but have dual citizenship ) , thank you very much . 
  i disagree 100 % . 
  i want the austro-hungarian back , pretty please . 
  i know , but hungarians do the same and then eat a 10 course dessert just to top it off . 
  i feel physically ill just thinking about it . 
  romania consumes more calories per capita than hungary ? 
  i refuse to believe it !, 
  bmw ? 
  yes , yes , i know ... 
  you get what you pay for . 
  i 'm not saying do n't go to bucharest , but in my opinion you should see sibiu , brasov and sighisoara first , if you ever come to romania . 
  only a serbian could bash one of the most amazing places in europe . 
  i love the dalmatian coast and ragusa . 
  after hearing all the `` facts '' , i 'm not convinced either . 
  i sorta agree with this sentiment , but what other solution is there ? 
  because it 's become pretty clear that not doing anything is the worst possible scenario . 
   very non-inclusive and xenophobic it hurts me to hear people talk about hungary like this , and parroting it as if it were true . 
  one does n't exclude the other , though , it 's good to put things into perspective , both good and bad . 
  really ? 
  that 's amazing . 
  well why not ? 
  they 're your neighbours , you have a shared history , economy and culture with them , and frankly it 's always good to be ambitious . 
  does that comparison make any sense to you ? 
  just asking ... 
   but a life ban on entering the parliment building ? 
  really ? 
  there are laws against this , and for good reason . 
  shouting `` fire '' in a crowded theatre guarantees a lifetime ban from it as well . 
  imagine if one of the guards panicked and started shooting ; by the time he realises his mistake , a mass panic erupts and people can get hurt or worse . 
  ask op what ? 
  what relevance does the 3 speed eu have to the discussion i was having with you ? 
  i 'm beginning to think that you 're trolling me . 
  the national arena was a costly project , yes , but nowhere near [ this monstrosity . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_people%27s_salvation_cathedral ) in any case , you do n't go from 0 to 100 without reaching 60 first , and while there is still a whole lot to do in order to reach western standards , it 's getting there . 
  : there 's a reason why i use the transylvanian flair and not the romanian one ... 
   meh they 'll fix their problems once in the eu . 
  i 'd say it went pretty well so far . 
  huge difference between the romania of 2007 and the romania of 2015 , if you ask me . 
  pretty much every country in the v4 would protest being included in eastern europe . 
  they are `` central europeans '' , 
  nope , it 's officially a secular state . 
  plus they have one of the largest atheistic populations per capita in the world . 
  that was in no way a minority . 
  take a look at the extended video , it 's truly scary . 
   politically incorrect you , my friend , have absolutely no idea what political correctness means . 
  boring , but a technocrat who has n't been involved in scandals . 
  also transylvanian , so that 's nice . 
  whether the eu is a `` state '' or not is highly debatable , but your exact words were `` the biggest economies in the world '' , of which the eu is certainly a part of ( as an entity ) . 
  good job ignoring the fact that the eu is the world largest economic bloc . 
  but if you tweak it , it wo n't be haggis anymore , will it ? 
  let 's not forget that when constantine i officially declared christianity the state religion , the majority of the population was still polytheistic . 
  anecdotally , i know lots of europeans that do speak some mandarin . 
  apparently , it 's not that hard to actually start speaking , reading and writing is the real problem . 
  i had the same experience when i visited krak\u00f3w and zakopane earlier this year : supposedly extremely touristy places , but most people lacked even the most basic english language skills , and frankly i had an easier time getting by with hungarian and some croatian . 
  chill , they do n't . 
  way too preoccupied hating on muslims to take notice of other white europeans . 
  i love the uk , but that does n't mean that i 'm blind to its faults ( or the faults of its people ) .

  jesus , man , take your tinfoil hat off . 
  excellent way to prove exactly my point , by the way . 
  y' know , we do n't really pass the buck to anybody . 
  we 're just not a target in the first place , romania has seen almost no uptick in asylum-seekers . 
  the government over here promised to help , but so far nobody ( as far as i know ) has been sent our way . 
  they did it [ earlier this year ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/ecb-decision-to-weaken-euro-comes-with-pluses-and-minuses-a-1015322.html ), 
  this is the stupidest `` celebration '' ever . 
  50 years of communism have turned betraying our allies into a `` day of national celebration '' ; we even used to have the national stadium in bucharest referred to as the 23 ^ rd of august stadium . 
  honestly , this really is n't a thing to celebrate or be proud of . 
  we were faced with 2 terrible choices and , overall , we took the smaller evil , but that 's in no way admirable or worthy of celebration . 
  honestly , i really hate that about this sub sometimes . 
  i 've seen americans who made excellent points get downvoted and discarded out of hand for `` this aint the us m8 '' , as if that automatically discounts your point of view . 
  what worked ? 
  bulgaria never had a high number of economic `` refugees '' ( which i agree are a problem ) or even regular refugees in the first place . 
  * at most * it was used as a passing point towards france or germany . 
  hell , or even hungary . 
  they built the fence * in expectation * of an influx , which never came . 
  romania did nothing of the sort , and we still have n't seen any meaningful rise in illegal immigrants - because we were never a target in the first place , just like bulgaria is n't either . 
  saying that the fence had any sort of meaningful impact is outright not understanding the social , political or economic reality of europe . 
  i understand where you 're coming from , i just disagree with gunning people down when you have other choices ( like tear gas ) . 
  and my personal opinion is that there always should be other choices when it comes to a bunch of desperate people rather than shooting them dead . 
  tear gas , water cannons , segregation from general populace , basically ( almost ) anything that does n't end with the death of another human . 
  are you american by chance ? 
  no offense meant ( i.e. 
  discounting your opinion based on your nationality ) , but i see this `` deterrent '' type of mentality a lot from americans - and it 's a view i completely 100 % disagree with since it 's been proven to not work . 
  well , i do n't really agree with shooting them . 
  these are still human beings , and i do n't think anybody should be killed for trying to find a better life - illegally or not . 
   stick them in solitary confinement you are advocating cruelty for no reason . 
  psch , see , you 've been brainwashed . 
  civilization [ literally started in romania ] ( http://humansarefree.com/2010/11/true-history-lessons.html ) !, 
  you did n't know , but ancient dacians invented the latin language , they were the first people on the moon , arsenie boca is the closest humanity will ever get to an orthodox pope superstar , the balkans are half as civilized as we are and we literally invented technology . 
  all of it . 
   such wealth [ indeed ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=tigani&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cacq_auoawovchmivlsdmse6xwivcz8uch0fnqpi&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=930#tbm=isch&amp;q=tigani+lux ), 
  it 's just a formula that calculates the `` weight '' of recent results . 
  it really does n't reflect reality , i agree , but it 's not really supposed to - just general result trends . 
  because english is the de facto lingua franca right now . 
  romania is doing quite well nowadays , though - we 're [ # 7 in fifa 's standings !, 
  ] ( http://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/ ), 
  [ me_irl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tck0mygnhjo ), 
  france did something that was hilarious ( to me , at least ) - they gave $ 300 euros and paid for planes back to romania for all the illegal rromas that they caught . 
  the only thing they managed to do was give them money to pay for their own way back to france . 
  oh , man , you really need to watch the mario bros movie , it 's insanely terrible . 
  i completely recommend watching it with rifftrax . 
  damn , that 's some inflammatory language . 
  plunder . 
  looting . 
  `` agreement '' . 
  it does n't even try to be an actual analysis , it starts from the conclusion that germany is evil and then builds the rest of the blogpost around that . 
  next they 'll accuse germany of salting the earth and burning greece 's barns and killing their livestock . 
  any anglophone country . 
  more people in romania need to speak english . 
  it sucks that all this is happening , but ...  large numbers spent the night stuck on macedonia 's southern frontier , and tried to charge police in the morning . 
  i mean , hundreds / thousands of people charging at you makes it pretty understandable that they used tear gas , as regrettable as the entire situation is . 
  i have almost no idea what 's going on in turkey , what 's all this about , can someone break it down for me please ? 
   i might as well say that `` the us https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism, 
  he looks like kingpin from spiderman cartoons . 
  well , it answers the `` what your country is '' part of the question . 
  the other one is also simple , `` looks like a fish , above greece '', 
  `` oh , i always wanted to visit bulgaria ! '', 
  super simple , just say `` dracula '' and everybody instantly knows . 
   number of rapes in sweden since they started multikulturalising themselves christ , i hate seeing this shit parroted by stupid people who have no fucking clue what they 're talking about . 
  the number has increased , you bigoted fuck , because since 2005 the definition of rape in sweden has been [ expanded to include many more situations ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19592372 ) that just `` forced vaginal penetration '' . 
  more than that , every single instance of sexual assault is recorded individually - if a woman is raped 3 times by the same person , 3 new cases will be opened instead of 1 containing all them . 
  reminds me of that scene from arrested development where jim cramer upgrades bluth stock from `` sell '' to `` do n't buy '' . 
  i think it meant to say `` relocating '' instead of `` relating '' . 
  `` oh , just 19 people missing ? 
  psch , big deal , i 'll only acknowledge it when it 's over 1000 ! '', 
  as reality as we know it continues to disintegrate around us , can we expect eldritch horrors from the beyond to rise up and claim their thrones above humanity ? 
  it totally exceeds the rise in cost of living . 
  i 'm earning a lot more than that now - i got lucky and got a job right out of highschool for a major it company which set me on a great career path - but a $ 600 / month salary is still pretty good for bucharest , which is by far the most expensive city in the country . 
  $ 600 does n't mean as much nowadays as it did 7 years ago , but you can still live pretty comfortably with it . 
  though , when i started working , i was only making about $ 350 / month , which was about the median wage . 
  for comparison , right now the median wage in romania is ~ $ 450 . 
  but it salaries in romania rival western europe . 
  a programmer can easily earn $ 2000 / month or more at any of the major it companies active in bucharest . 
  the article itself is n't bad , but the way the title is phrased , and the adversarial way in which lagarde is presented makes no sense . 
  varoufakis did n't make any outlandish statements that nobody believed - just that by its own rules , imf ca n't be involved . 
  i fail to see what the vindication is . 
   are your wages going up in bucharest , completely and unequivocally yes . 
  when i started working in 2008 a good salary was considered anything over $ 600 . 
  nowadays , $ 600 is considered entry-level salary at the same company . 
  romania - most popular musicians nowadays are actually masons who worship satan and serve nwo and are doing all they can to brainwash our country 's youth . 
  it 's not the * top * conspiracy theory , but plenty of people believe it . 
  mostly stupid people , but we have plenty of those . 
  wooo , romania can finally into western europe !, 
  my mother went to turkey for vacation a couple of years ago - she ended up spending ~ $ 250 for a 4 day vacation , lodging included . 
  she stayed at a pension , so it cost a lot less than a hotel room , but she still spent about half what she would have in romania , even if she stayed at a pension over here . 
  you 're very welcome , friend !, 
  let me know if i can do anything else for you . 
  no way , man , bulgarian beaches are 3x more beautiful than romanian beaches imo . 
  hell , romanians are going to bulgaria for vacation nowadays , prices over here are fucking stupid . 
  hotels on the romanian seaside would rather have empty rooms than lower the prices a bit . 
  man , not even 10 years . 
  it wages are super high in romania * right now * , you can fairly easily get a $ 24000 - 36000 / year net salary in bucharest working as a programmer . 
  enough money to live in western europe , enough money to be pretty fucking rich in bucharest . 
  that might be true , romania has a major victim complex ( myself included , as exemplified by these comments ) . 
   when you say the uk , i think you mean our government . 
  i meant the government , private newspapers and tv stations were all involved in what was seen over here as a denigration campaign against romania and bulgaria . 
  i only saw the first part of the documentary . 
  i realize the average british person does n't feel that way and had nothing to do with that campaign .

  for example , romania and bulgaria should have joined schengen in 2011 but they keep getting delayed because of `` corruption problems '' . 
  well , guess what , greece is more corrupt than both these countries , yet it 's been in schengen for a long time . 
  but we do n't bitch and whine like the greeks do ( although with the greeks bitching and whining so loud , i doubt anyone would hear us anyway ) , we silently work and do our best so that the next year will be better than the current one . 
  romania 's ppp gdp per capita is around $ 20,000 while greece 's is around $ 26,000 . 
  in 2007 , it was like $ 14,000 vs $ 30,000 . 
  so they better be careful , because in a few years , even europe 's `` shit league '' might leave them in the dust . 
  of course i do n't believe the average greek is responsible for the deep shit greece is currently in , but they do hold a big chunk of the blame . 
  first , they did n't pay their taxes and second , they kept voting corrupt idiots into power . 
  as for their attitude , especially as of now , i do n't like it . 
  i think they should stop fooling themselves by voting in parties like syriza , which make extremely unrealistic promises . 
  i 've seen alexis tsipras ' promises and he seems to totally ignore the fact greece is on emergency life support . 
   and should they stay or should they go ? 
  with their constant bitching and whining about how everyone else is to blame but them , them cozying up to russia , and especially their recent threats , i believe they should go . 
  their bullshit about german war reparations was pretty ridiculous and put them in a bad light , but i do n't believe that a country which threatens to unleash wave of migrants on europe ** `` including isis jihadists '' ** should be a part of the eu . 
  if they continue with this kind of shit talk , i believe the eu should tell them to go fuck themselves . 
  that diagram is confusing as fuck , why do n't they just use the years normally ? 
  dat hungarian enclave in romania tho . 
   anyway i do n't see any problem whatsoever with adoption and i support lgbt population !, 
  i think lgbt adoption is fucked up . 
  first , a kid does not get to choose wether he 'll be adopted by a straight or gay couple , second , it 's pretty tough explaining to a kid at a young age why everybody else 's parents are of different sexes , yet his parents are the same sex . 
  finally , but this is most importantly , it is bound that the kid will get bullied in school , as soon as his classmates/school finds out he has lgbt parents . 
   it found that the average wealth of the best-off one-fifth of families rose by 64 per cent between 2005 and 2012-13 as they put more money aside as a buffer against future shocks . 
  they have average savings and investments of around # 10,000 compared with # 6,000 seven years earlier . 
  one fifth = 20 %  if you really want to get into a ` omg uk is so poor now ' argument i 'll just point out that london has the highest concentration of billionaires in the world . 
  well , according to [ this article ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/pulse/billionaires-homes-around-world-new-york-city-houses-103-richest-people-planet-1697132 ) , it 's actually new york . 
  london comes third , after moscow . 
  now , it 's sure great london has 72 billionaires , but what about the [ rough sleepers of which there are more than 10 times as many ? 
  ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/407030/rough_sleeping_statistics_england_-_autumn_2014.pdf ) also , i 'm not trying to say uk is poor , because it 's not , however it is very unequal , especially when compared with other european countries . 
   though let 's all hope this does n't turn into cold war 2 . 
  it already has , let 's just hope it does n't heat up . 
  it 's a good start , but we need more . 
  if that 's the case , why change the rules then ? 
  well , the rule should be , buy what you really like as long as it does n't destabilize you financially . 
  my dad had a friend who won the lottery in italy back in 2003 . 
  if i remember correctly , it was around 1.5 mil . 
  euros . 
  the guy quit his job , returned to romania , bought himself a nice big house , 10 cars , one for each member of his family . 
  for himself , he bought a nice mercedes s-class , which was a pretty rare sight in romania at that time . 
  12 years later , he 's almost 50 , divorced , kid is in the us , he lives on a little over 500 euros a month . 
  forget the big house and the car , he had to sell those because of high maintenance costs and taxes . 
  he lives in his old apartment and drives a dacia logan . 
  funny thing is , some of his relatives still have the same cars he bought them . 
  if that 's not stupidity , i do n't know what is . 
  look , i 'm not a millionaire , but i still manage to save almost 30 % -40 % of my income , almost every single month . 
  but i live in an apartment , even though i could afford a mortgage for a house and drive a second hand vw even though i could afford a bmw or a mercedes with a little effort . 
  this makes me confident that if i 'll ever get a large sum of money , i wo n't go on a spending spree that gets me broke . 
  the point is , if a person wins the lottery and then goes broke , they have only themselves to blame . 
  well , evading taxes is just another way to live beyond your means , especially when the government was spending money at the same time like there was no tomorrow . 
  tax evasion was not just something rich people did , but also average people , before the crisis , if you 'd ask a taxi driver in athens to turn on the meter , he 'd probably kicked you out of his car . 
  thing is , greece fucked up , so now its entirely up to them who pays the price , the rich , the poor , it 's their problem , but the price has to be paid . 
  typical , if you are n't happy with something , just change the rules . 
  this also happened in romania in 2012 , when there was an impeachment referendum against the president , it required a participation of at least 50 % + 1 of the eligible voters , the government changed the law a day before the referendum , so that the president could be impeached with a simple majority . 
  it did n't work out though , as the constitutional court ruled the decree unconstitutional . 
  maybe the slovene society is n't ready yet for same-sex marriages , maybe politicians should take this into account . 
  i really hope the greek government cuts it with the bullshit , otherwise , in a few years , the greeks will start stealing romanian and bulgarian jobs ... 
  if they 'll still be in the eu , that is . 
   maybe a million is too much to actually be possible , but if you redistributed the wealth , there would be no long term inflation . 
  short term inflation could occur due to changed demand structure , but production would reorient soon . 
  well , i assumed you say give them a million , by simply printing money . 
  that 's surely possible , but it would generate an economic apocalypse . 
  redistributing the wealth is a different story , but even that rarely works as planned . 
  poor people are generally stupid . 
  and by poor people , i do n't mean people who are broke . 
  being broke is a temporary situation , being poor is a perpetual state . 
  you can give poor people any amount of money , most of the time they 'll end up exactly where they started . 
   i assume you mean passive income . 
  then that 's the old british way of measuring wealth . 
  a gentleman 's wealth was measured in annual income it generated . 
  ideally it should be passive income , yeah , but it can be active income as well if you are able to live comfortably and you have enough savings that losing your job or having a major health problem wo n't get you broke . 
   as if financial advisors would be useful if you dont have your own knowledge . 
  they 're especially useful if you do n't know what the hell you 're doing . 
   they will just sell you anything that benefits them . 
  that 's why its important to get a good one , with good references . 
   but you are so clever so you can tell why no expert ever forsees a crash but they do , the problem is they usually ca n't do much about it . 
  if i were a reputable financial expert and say the euro was going to crash next week , a lot of people would panic , sell their euros for usd and the euro would crash even faster . 
   banks need to be rescued by the taxpayer despite knowing best a bank getting a shitload of taxpayer money ? 
  that sounds precisely like what a bank would want . 
  did you forget the fact that this whole crisis was generated by banks doing shady shit ? 
  there 's no reason to believe the bailouts to be shady shit also , right ? 
  why not let the market correct itself , it 's capitalism 101 . 
  this article is about the rich being richer and the poor being poorer than before the crisis , to me this sounds an awful lot like what a bank ceo would want . 
  wow , never had imagined the difference between the net average wealth and mean net wealth in sweden would be almost as high as in the us . 
  going back to my point , this says nothing about the savings in each country . 
   if you somehow gave a million to everyone in the bottom half , in ten years time most would be as poor as before , if not worse . 
  they would actually end up much worse , because the huge demand for consumption goods would skyrocket , trigering inflation . 
  the rich would become much richer , and the poor , much poorer . 
  winning the lottery or getting a shitload of money does not make you rich imo , the ability to constantly make much more money than you consume , that makes you rich . 
   calling the uneducated stupid is mean-spirited and elitist . 
  no its not . 
  if you win the lottery and do n't have any financial education , you hire a financial advisor and fucking listen to him . 
  but of course this does n't happen , most poor people are n't einstein , if they were , they would n't be poor . 
   well enough to trigger a reppelling referendum , like the one which did repell a similar same sex why do you think politicians want this law so badly if it was already repelled in a referendum only 3 years ago ? 
  greece 's problems did not start in a year and they wo n't end that fast . 
  greece 's problems started more than 15 years ago , when they started living beyond their means on borrowed money . 
  the situation is so bad that it 's extremely unlikely greece will ever be able to repay all the debts . 
  the crisis will continue , at least for the foreseeable future . 
  i had no idea someone with # 10,000 in savings is considered `` rich '' in britain . 
  this is pretty tragic to be honest . 
  lubeni\u021b\u0103 comes from serbian and harbuz comes from russian . 
  pretty simple if you look at the neighbors .

  less money spent on benefits = more money to be spent on contracts with their pals ' companies . 
  minimum wage job earners can still get benefits in addition to their wages . 
  but the norwegians also get double salaries . 
  ceau\u0219escu was aberrant from the eastern european leaders ' standard . 
  during the 1980s , the opinions of the people in other eastern bloc countries ( such as yugoslavia and czechoslovakia ) about romania and ceau\u0219escu were similar to what we think now about north korea and the kims . 
  but of course it was the political system 's fault for allowing such leaders to get the power . 
  the romanian state admitted it participated in the holocaust . 
  all you need now to do is convince the history teachers of this . 
  then nothing changed since i finished high school . 
  i remember that the textbook ended with the 1989 revolution ( although more than a decade had passed , nothing further was said ) . 
   making big improvements is easier when you start at a lower basepoint and even during the `` golden age '' of the 1930es , romania was a fairly backward and poor european country . 
  of course , it was a low basepoint , but my point was that the principality/kingdom of of romania , in almost a century ( 1859-1948 ) was not able to achieve universal literacy , which was then achieved in a decade ( 1949-1959 ) . 
  the romanian elite never cared about the regular people before that . 
  the `` golden age '' was indeed a golden age for the elite and the quality and size of the cultural output of that era was not found anywhere in the history of the romania . 
   but then , no political system can be 100 % evil or incompetent . 
  which is exactly the point that the taught history should present . 
   the economical performance of communist romania after wwii is not that exceptional try to compare the 1948-1978 period , when we had some `` standard '' communist policies . 
  during that period we had higher growth than western europe . 
  1978-1989 was when ceau\u0219escu did his insane policies . 
    in the 1940s the median romanian family lived in an one-room house made out of cow dung   really ?!, 
  at least in wallachia and moldavia , yes . 
  here in wallachia it was called * chirpici * ( if the house was made out of bricks made out of mud and cow dung ) and * paiant\u0103 * ( if it 's a wooden frame filled with mud/cow dung ) . 
  often they were used together : a wooden frame with mud bricks , or with alternative layers of mud and wood . 
   not the modern medicine , vaccines , antibiotics , sanitation and all other useful implements usually developed by the rotten western democracies . 
  access to modern medicine was already widely available in the 1930s for most of the population in western europe ( which is why when we had 40 years life expectancy in the 1930s , they already had 60 years ) and to the romanian elite . 
  the peasants in interwar romania ( who made up 80-85 % of the population ) had virtually no access to modern medicine . 
  and this was not just in the countryside , if you look at a statistical yearbook in the 1920s-1930s , you 'll see that even bucharest had something like 18-20 % child mortality . 
  what the communists did was making that modern medicine available to everyone . 
  usually laws for `` vandalism '' talk about damage to the property . 
   our great political battle of the 20th century was between the fascists and the ultra-fascists , with hitler helping the former against the later indeed . 
  for those not acquainted with romanian history , the `` ultra-fascists '' , ( or rather , `` mystical fascists '' ) were the [ iron guard ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_guard ) led by charismatic [ corneliu zelea codreanu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corneliu_zelea_codreanu ) , while the regular `` fascists '' ( who had a more german/nazi-style ideology ) were led by [ ion antonescu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_antonescu ) . 
  they clashed during the 1941 [ legionnaires ' rebellion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legionnaires'_rebellion_and_bucharest_pogrom ) , during which the iron guard took the opportunity to start an anti-jewish pogrom in bucharest . 
  even today , the romanian fascists are either pro-antonescu or pro-codreanu fascists . 
  romania . 
  * emphasising of the victory and fighting against the ottomans , with less emphasis on the fact that most of the time we collaborated with them and had to pay a tribute . 
  * [ roma/gypsy slavery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_romania ) ( 13th century-1856 ) is usually not mentioned at all * `` conquest was never a goal for romania '' . 
  apart from pokuttya ( medieval ) , southern dobruja ( balkan wars ) and transnistria ( wwii ) . 
  * moldavian and wallachian rulers were romanian patriots before there was a `` romanian '' natin . 
  * communism was 100 % evil , forgetting how it raised the life expectancy from 45 to 70 years , literacy from 50 % to 99 % , child mortality from 20 % to 2 % and how in the 1940s the median romanian family lived in an one-room house made out of cow dung , while in 1989 in a reasonably modern apartment building . 
  * how wonderful was the glorious kingdom of romania ( 1881-1948 ) ; the fact that the army occasionally killed up to a few thousands of protesters ( such as in [ 1907 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1907_romanian_peasants'_revolt ) or during the 1930s ) is occasionally mentioned , but little about the social causes of those protests . 
  ( incredible poverty ), 
  to the germans here : why is `` insulting organs and representatives of foreign countries '' a crime ? 
  should n't freedom of speech allow this kind of opinions , especially if it 's about an organization or foreign government and not about a person ? 
  would i be arrested if i protested against the north korean government policies as well or just the us has this special treatment ? 
  also , the ryanair flag has the irish 1:2 ratio , whereas the flag they 're burning has a 2:3 ratio , as the ivory coast 's flag . 
  people go there for a good soak . 
   jebo ti pas mater ( dog fucks your mother ) - oddly enough this is usually not a very bad curse word , it 's used by people who do n't want to curse . 
  only in the balkans !, 
   the only dog-related swearing in romanina is `` s\u0103 te fut\u0103 c\u00e2inii '' = may the dogs fuck you . 
  we have many of those sweariungs or similar . 
  we love adding religious stuff to swearings , such as `` futu-\u021bi pa\u0219tele / dumnezeii m\u0103-tii '' = fuck your mother 's easter/gods . 
    a couple of years ago , the market 's interest rates they were forced to pay reached 30 % / year . 
  with the help of the eu/imf , they got this in check , so now their interest rate for 10 years bonds is `` just '' 11 % / year . 
    so once again , thank you eu and imf !!, 
  i do n't see it as a success . 
  greek debt was in q1 2013 [ 168 % of gdp ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_22/05/2013_500143 ) , up from 107 % of gdp five years ago . 
  an 11 % interest rate means it would have to pay at least 18 % of the gdp each year just to keep the same debt level , without repaying anything . 
  this is obviously not sustainable . 
  so the default will happen , it 's a question of ** when ** , not of ** if ** . 
   a default automatically means there is no economy left . 
  in the 20th century , there have been more than a hundred defaults . 
  some countries had several of them . 
  it has nothing to do with `` no economy left '' , it has only to do with policy and politics . 
   the greek government would no longer be capable of even paying its employees , leading to massive poverty . 
  that 's complete and utter nonsense . 
  the greek government had in q1 2013 a primary surplus , which means that they got more money from taxes than they paid for regular expenses . 
  they do have a large deficit because they must pay huge interest rates on the loans . 
  a couple of years ago , the market 's interest rates they were forced to pay reached 30 % / year . 
  with the help of the eu/imf , they got this in check , so now their interest rate for 10 years bonds is `` just '' 11 % / year . 
  the debt levels are unsustainable and sooner or later they 'd have to default , the problem is that by then they 'd have no economy left . 
  not due to monetary policy , but if they had an independent monetary policy , it would have been easier to solve them . 
   honest question to the french people here : are the french women really having so many babies or are the immigrants having so many babies that the national average goes up ? 
  i remember there were some statistics about this and the french women of non-immigrant background still had more children than the average european . 
  i do n't recall the exact figures , but the overall number was around 2.0 , while the french women of non-immigrant background have around 1.9 children ( still very high compared to the german 1.35 children ) . 
  actually , it occurred twice , independently : in europe and in africa ( among the nomadic cow-herders ) , but in europe it spread more because of the european climate . 
   vlach language is some kind of old archaic dialect so literal romanian sounds very different to us , like a really different language even though probably 90 % of words are the same , i guess , but some grammar and pronunciation is different . 
  it 's the language without the neologisms borrowed in the last 150 years , as spoken in rural areas . 
  the romanian peasants across the danube in romania speak exactly the same simple language ( without the neologisms ) and no one is claiming it 's a different language from romanian . 
  99 % of the grammar is definitely not different . 
  you might find some minor differences from standard romanian , but those are standard dialectal differences that you can find on the other bank of the danube as well . 
  from what i read in the romanian press , it 's basically : * no education in their language * the romanian orthodox church is not allowed to build churches * indimidation from neonazis, 
  sorry , i do n't know more details . 
  it 's not a topic you bring up often in conversation . 
  some tidbits about romanians ' relationship with the serbs : * in romania , we say that we never had any wars with just two of our neighbours : serbia and the black sea . 
  * during the 1990s embargo against serbia , romanians did not enforce it very strongly . 
  a lot of people from along the border got rich smuggling reservoir-fuls of gas into serbia or even boatfuls . 
  * many of the people traditionally known as `` serbs '' in wallachia were actually bulgarians who fled ottoman conscription and pretended to be native serbs in order not to be sent back . 
  * i know just one romanian of partial serb ancestry : her serbian grandfather was part of the waffen ss and she said that when she was a child , he told her stories about the war crimes he committed . 
  * romanian nationalists are conflicted by the fact that `` serbs are our orthodox brothers '' , but they do n't treat very well their vlach/romanian minority in timok valley . 
  of course , i 've seen in bucharest a silly `` valea timocului e rom\u00e2nia '' graffiti ( based on the `` kosovo je srbija '' slogan ) . 
  unfortunately , 2 ^ 6 -1 is not a prime number . 
  i think the number of mps should definitely be a prime number . 
  the people of the us are also slightly in favor of snowden , polls saying that more americans think of him as a `` hero '' than people who think of him as a `` traitor '' . 
  it 's a joke . 
  no , there is no burek competition and bosnian bureks might even be better , but i have yet to try them . 
  * winners of the `` balkans ' best burek '' competition * zagreb is a nice city with a typical austro-hungarian architecture . 
  * a lot of yugo-nostalgics , even among young people who were born after tito died . 
  i wonder if that 's valid in other places in former yugoslavia . 
  * `` speak kaj or die '' -- seen on the t-shirt of a zagrebian ; [ kajkavian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kajkavian_dialect ) is a local dialect of serbo-croatian * you must be careful with the sharp pebbles on the beaches . 
  * the dalmatians used to speak an interesting romance language ( that vaguely sounded like italian ) -- now extinct * zagreb is allegedly the intellectual version of belgrade .

  this means becoming , at the very least , more like the swiss confederation if nothing else . 
   a european alliance is good in my opinion . 
  the issue is that loose alliances pretty much always fail to internal squabbling or further strengthen into a more cohesive whole . 
  the achaen league tried to keep a loose alliance and got crushed . 
  the german principates weakend the hre until it became the chessboard of europe until united in the 19th century . 
  even the lessons of the feudal liberties the szlachta of poland and magnates of hungary , who feared strong leaders and prefered full autonomy can serve a lesson as they both created weak states that lead poland falling to russia and hungary to the ottomans . 
  there is a balance to be struck here , but i do n't think it 's on the loose alliance side of the spectrum . 
   united states of europa federal europe , please . 
  or confoederatio europea . 
  no need to bring americanisms into this . 
   i 'm irish , pro-eu and think that for such a culturally diverse landmass we have more in common together then we do apart . 
  we are united by history and culture . 
  i think we are even more united by a common future than by history , although our many historical links are important . 
  we are as of now the most stable region in the world for a reason . 
  there are regions that are more linguistically , culturally , and religiously homogeneous , as well as having closer historical links and still only manage to focus on petty grudges and constant power plays . 
  we are able to look beyond that . 
  call it education , call it the effects of the enlightment , but when we europeans talk then definitely seem to get more done than the utter chaos that passes for the rest of the world . 
  that 's something worth building on . 
   right in the article buddy . 
  not clear at all . 
  believe everything you read , then ? 
  read this : http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bae-systems-southkorea-iduskbn0ii01u20141029 edit : to simplify things : the us air force nudge the price up by adding `` risk reserves '' costs at the last minute , as a contingency for cost overruns , despite bae saying it can work in existing costs . 
  not dodgy at all , no , of course not . 
   to introduce the dreaded brussels bureaucracy instead . 
  what brussels bureaucracy can i ask ? 
  outside the dreaded uk newspapers , i have n't actually come across it . 
  especially since it seems it has less bureaucrats than a small town council : https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-debate-does-brussels-employ-fewer-bureaucrats-derbyshire/, 
  there 's a handful of countries doing f35s , the biggest of which ( level 1 partner ) is the uk , who are also massive supporters of the 2 % limits . 
  if someone points out their massive f35 orders from a partnership , that 's where my head jumps . 
  and it was clearly not south korea that canceled the contract . 
  the contract was fine until they made it to the us committee . 
  us requisition is notoriously political , and bae just does n't have the influence in washington the home grown companies have . 
  let me guess , the uk ? 
  well , remember then to [ know your place ] ( https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/south-korea-kills-bae-systems-f-16-upgrade-programm-405695/ ) , especially since a certain president wants to bring jobs back to his country . 
   what 1/27 plane are you talking about exactly ? 
  it 's a metaphor . 
  a figure of speech . 
  would you have preferred a carrier or an armoured division instead ? 
  and good on you , you just funded the us arms industry , largely subsidized by its military-industrial complex while europe 's looses out due to small and sporadic orders . 
  bloody grand future you 're helping build . 
  grand , so all we all have to do is give veterans bigger pensions and that will ensure the security of europe . 
  the 2 % requirement is a joke . 
  [ heh , right . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/mod-accused-of-using-creative-accounting-to-meet-nato-commitment-on-defence-spending-a6993526.html ), 
   he has a point , they only want an eu army because they do n't want to spend more , what good will come from a cooperation that is initiated by the reluctance to spend a dime . 
  if everyone has enough money to buy 1/27 of an airplane , but does n't manage it together , then what 's the point ? 
  why keep buying second/third hand crap , and maintaining 30 year old equipment just so you can match some arbitrary number ? 
  that 's not security , that 's just throwing money into the fire . 
  the `` spend more '' side does n't have an actual goal . 
  it 's just an appeasing tactic to please the americans . 
  there was nothing shock therapy did that gradual reform could n't have achieved like it did in china . 
  and the ussr would have not been ready for it until cheap high-speed trains were invented , the russian infrastucture simply is n't there to supported that sort of market liberalism . 
  actually , i think `` shock therapy '' had a great deal to do with it . 
  that truly disenchanted everyone of the new world order . 
  the 80s neocons pretty much set the future to fail to be honest . 
  there used to be that brief moment in the 90s when it looked like the world was changing and a new age of prosperity was on the edge of happening . 
   no , i think that if members want a different level , they need to actually bring up 1.8 % or whatever and argue for that level being sufficient . 
  `` agree and ignore '' is n't a good route . 
  i think that the percent here is reasonably clear and unambiguous , and no more gameable than most other measurements that i can think of . 
  you missunderstand . 
  there are many things that would be different under a more unitary system . 
  some examples : - common accounting standards and supervision . 
  no putting veteran pensions as defense spending , and every dime is overseen . 
  - common budget . 
  that means member states are n't free to spend that money buying extra expensive toilet paper from the local manufacturer . 
  - bang for buck - instead of each country having enough to buy an 1/8 of an airplane . 
  we can actually get the damn airplane . 
  these added system mean that we can actually ask for lower budgetary percentages , like 0.5 % or as you say 1.8 , and actually achieve more . 
  this is a pr win , especially since the agreement is democratic rather than dictated . 
  asking for 2 % , because it 's a nice neat number , does n't address the systematic insufficiency of the nato system , that leaves countries chronically dependent on us spending even at the best of times , while allowing them to abuse the system at the worst . 
  nato in other words , only really worked because of the reality of the military build up in the cold war . 
  with that threat gone , and without the democratic legitimacy of representative supervision like the eu , that means that a us president has to provide the threat himself , further hurting transatlantic relations . 
  for the good of everyone , the future is not in nato 's blind 2 % requirement . 
  but in a realistic , and de facto increase in security on the continent , that goes beyond achieving an arbitrary standard . 
  that is done through european unity , the 2 % is a redherring . 
  apparently it 's 'em barrassing ' for foreign ministers to meet together . 
  ca n't even organize an unofficial dinner without the british throwing a tantrum and storming out of the room . 
  if that 's how some see how to treat cooperation with allies , what else can be said ? 
  then why does n't he support nicola sturgeon ? 
  the 2 % floor for military budgets does not assure our security , it 's a joke . 
  2 % of nothing is nothing , and small countries are running on very little to begin with . 
  they 're only hope is to buy equipment second hand , and hope it does n't require any spare-parts that are out of production . 
  stop supporting the 2 % limit , it 's not realistic to expect anything to come of it other than making small countries poorer , and considering the accounting tricks the uk gets away with you ca n't ever know if that 2 % is legit . 
  if you want to support increased eu security and lower american spending here , it 's better to have an actual system of budgeting and requisition across the whole of the eu . 
  one that might take even less than that 2 % , and leverages across big contracts and shared equipment to give more actual bang for our buck . 
  it would be nice to have the agency move east , but considering that stockholm has the `` european centre for disease prevention and control '' , it makes sense to located the agency next to it to share competencies and experts . 
  now , that might mean stockholm itself , although putting it in one of the baltic capitals might be a better choice . 
  i like / u/taenk suggestion actually , giving romania the eppo instead would be a great boon and an extra bit of security in having the eppo stare at the country 's state day to day . 
  although , admittedly , it 's likely better placed organizationally next to the hague to be near eurojust . 
   why did the police allow the `` peaceful demonstration '' where people are carrying shields go ahead ? 
  um , nothing illegal against carrying shields . 
  in fact , every time i see protesters get watercannoned , i wonder why they did n't prepare in advance . 
  i know they have protest workshops ffs . 
   i really wish that cameron and merkel had been able to work something out . 
  would have been a very different political environment in europe today . 
  cameron and merkel working something out would have destroyed the union . 
  cameron painted himself into a corner with years of scapegoating , and breaching foundation treaties with intergovernmental support from germany would have relegated the eastern countries to second tier members . 
  not having to apply the deal that was made was a saving grace , not a mistake . 
  i think we should also look at extending support for the [ eac ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_african_community ) , [ caricom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caribbean_community ) and [ mercosur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercosur ) . 
  a european future , requires a european model .

    it 's this which large elements of the media ( and , it would seem , david cameron ) missed . 
  even now , when you ask people about the european parliament ( you know , the way you do , down the pub ) you get back the `` powerless talking shop '' quip . 
    except it is n't true . 
  it used to be . 
  but now the ep can hire and fire the commission , block or amend almost any eu law , including the eu budget , and now , as david cameron has discovered , threaten to veto any european council nominee for president . 
  the european parliament just took on her majesty 's government of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland , and beat it . 
  powerless talking shop ? 
  they 'll be wearing `` our parliament can beat up your prime minister '' tee shirts in the espace leopold this week . 
    for years , europe 's leaders kept getting stick every time they negotiated a new treaty . 
  europe , they were told , is n't democratic . 
  their response was to throw a few bones down the stairs into the basement where they kept their pretend parliament . 
  but nobody seemed to notice that the parliament was gobbling up everything it was given , and growing , and suddenly there 's a banging on the basement door and europe 's leaders discover there 's a fully grown parliament standing in front of them , and it 's not happy living in the basement anymore . 
    jean claude juncker can see the new reality . 
  for the first time ever , we have a european commission president who did n't get his job purely from the gift of the eu 's presidents and prime ministers , sitting around a dining table and holding an election by after eight . 
  his name was one the table early , picked by the epp , and the parliament was adamant . 
  the council has the power to nominate whomever it wants , but parliament was only going to accept one name . 
    juncker is parliament 's man . 
  he knows it , they know it , and if he wants a second term , he 'll have to remember it too , and being the savvy old operator he is , there 's no doubt he will . 
  he is the prime minister of a majority of the members of the european parliament . 
  they are the hand that feeds , not the member states . 
    after all , do you know who ( and only who ) has the power to sack juncker ? 
  the parliament . 
  not the member states . 
  yet another bone the member states threw down the steps without thinking , hoping it would keep the shouting from the basement down . 
  now look what they 've done . 
    the whole affair can be looked at two ways . 
  one , the british way , is of an old euro federalist playing the game much better than britain 's poor outclassed prime minister . 
  britain outsmarted once again by devious backroom continental dealers with their compromises and everybody must win a prize ways . 
    or there 's another way . 
    how was juncker 's outgoing predecessor , jose manual barroso picked ten years ago ? 
  the answer : out of the blue days before the vote , pretty much unknown to anyone who was n't portuguese . 
    yet those of us who actually care about this stuff ( the trekkies of international democratic politics ) have known that juncker , the socialists ' martin schulz and the liberals ' guy verhofstadt were the names on the table . 
  in a debate before the european elections , transmitted on telly ( with an rte host , by the way ) and hardly watched by anybody , schulz said very clearly , with juncker to his side , that the next president of the european commission would come from one of the candidates on the stage . 
    this was n't some secret backroom deal . 
  this was the most transparent process for we have ever had for choosing a commission president ever , and whilst it 's true that most europeans did n't even vote in the european elections , that 's a choice in itself . 
  the whole point of being a democracy is that you ca n't make people participate in it , only have the right to participate . 
    but this all matters . 
  in 2019 , when the next european elections come around , will the media and the member states pay closer attention to the nominees of the european parties ? 
  you 're damn right they will . 
  this is a game changer . 
  please do n't insult other users . 
  please do n't insult other users . 
  yeah . 
  it 's from the ottoman turkish word for jew .

  [ confirmed !, 
   in 2013 , thousands of hungarians demanding self-rule marched in transylvania . 
  they demand self-rule in the form of autonomy ( largely the szeklers , which are about half of romania 's ethnic hungarians ) , not independence . 
  the article makes it seem a bit as if all the hungarians want independence for all of transylvania ( where hungarians make up about 1/5 of the population ) . 
  the pro-autonomy part is mainly the compactly-hungarian enclave of szeklerland [ in eastern transylvania ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/hungarians_in_romania_blank.svg/1000px-hungarians_in_romania_blank.svg.png ) .

  [ eu/coe ] ( http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-5000100.htm ) :  the principles of use of the european emblem by third parties have been set out in an administrative agreement with the council of europe . 
  this agreement has been published in the official journal of the european union on 08/09/2012 ( [ 2012/c 271/04 ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=uriserv:oj.c_.2012.271.01.0005.01.eng ) ) . 
   according to this agreement , any natural or legal person ( `` third party user '' ) may use the european emblem or any of its elements , as long as this use  ( a ) does not create the impression or assumption that there is a connection between the third party user and any of the institutions , bodies , offices , agencies and organs of the european union or the council of europe where this connection does not exist ;  ( b ) does not lead the public to believe that the user benefits from the support , sponsorship , approval or consent of any of the institutions , bodies , offices , agencies and organs of the european union or the council of europe where this is not the case ;  ( c ) is not made in connection with any objective or activity which is incompatible with the aims and principles of the european union or the council of europe , or is otherwise unlawful . 
   if the use of the european emblem complies with the above conditions , there is no need to ask for written permission . 
   registration of the european emblem , or a heraldic imitation thereof , as a trade mark or as any other ip right is not acceptable . 
  all the press is in a good mood i see : bbc : '' [ german sausage makers in * meaty * fine over price-fixing ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-28310694 ) '' * [ emphasis mine ] *, 
  yeah , but i was talking about the region in general , not strictly ethnic romanians . 
  the whole point of this comment-thread is that `` region a within a-u fared better than region b within ottoman empire '', 
  th implication is that it was more developed because it was part of a-h , * as opposed to the rest being part of the ottoman empire . 
  * was n't transylvania more developed in 1918 than the rest of romania ( which was part of the ottoman empire ) as well ? 
  please do n't insult other users , no matter how incorrect you find their ideas . 
  thank you . 
  cgpgrey should make a video explaining the whole nomination process to people . 
  i 'm getting tired of the * `` everybody rubber-stamped him because merkel said so , eussr amirite ? 
  '' * narrative . 
  is this a form of protest , or only a form of goodbye without any negative undertones ? 
  so what you 're saying is that farage is like hitler ? 
   has a de facto opt out that the likes of poland , czech etc do n't have . 
  what is the difference between sweden and the rest ? 
  i know the title is exactly how amnesty wrote it , but would you mind resubmitting it without all caps . 
  it makes the submission look very aggressive . 
  thank you . 
  there is no oppression of roma , it 's all their fault . 
  \u201e you keep talking about the atrocities that happened to your ancestors , but no word on the atrocities committed by the bolshevo-comunist kikes against us ? '',

  no , you misunderstood me , i 'm sorry , i was referring to the fact that over here when you run a small business you kinda juggle with position titles , remuneration and workload to save up on costs . 
  and some managers are n't beneath the practice of remunerating full time jobs with par time salaries . 
  the only thing that keeps bottom end jobs become irrelevant over time due to inflation is the minimum wage . 
  so free overworked interns are not a thing up north ? 
  people do n't care about goverment abuse unless it effects them directly my issue is the 3 % hurdle , for a country with a large population that translates as a very high campaign cost for small parties . 
  but what about entrepreneurs and small businesses that can invent positions ? 
  the specific measures are meant to tackle consumer sectors because they offer the most publicity bang for the buck . 
  while major industries and energy goes uncontested because the have lobbyist and advocated that cry out think of the jobs . 
  but beyond the political issue you force the consumers to buy broken products , a 1 liter engine car can not climb a hill and 900 w vacuum cleaners are simply useless . 
  thanks . 
  fuck this shit carbon cuting is for headlines , first cars that can actually climb a hill get outlawed and this year vacuum cleaners that can actually vacuum get banned . 
  just saying target the energy industry not the consumers . 
  i speak for all romanians when i say this , you 're welcome , romanians ca n't swim and we are to poor to fly to the uk so most of our invasion was done by rail or ferry . 
  why is n't this a bigger scandal ? 
  are people okay with a 3 % quota ? 
  1 . no minimum wage in sweden and finland , hoq interesting , do unions have more power to compensate for the imbalance or are companies really that socially responsible and do n't abuse the system ? 
  minimum wage acros the eu would have very destructive effects for economies with low productivity , i really hope this is n't a thing . 
  ~ ~ here , here ~ ~ , hear hear , be proud , be british continental tariffs would be welcomed , who needs exports , and us mere continental plebs are not worthy of british excellence anyway . 
   however , this policy in itself is no guarantor of increased or improved competition . 
  what is guaranteed is that if no change is implemented the concentration will only increase , and the arguments for to big to fail are solidified . 
   firstly , capping a good bank that is seen as delivering an excellent service with fair fees is actually denying a new generation of would be bank customers the opportunity to open banking facilities according to their choice . 
  not capping them will deny opportunities for any new financial service company to enter the market , make it more resilient and develop new services . 
  we are talking about financial services where you do n't have large overheads . 
   one has to ask how can we trust the labour party when they oversaw the appointment of a former labour councillor , paul flowers as co-op bank chairman only for him to be engulfed in a drugs scandal and exposed for a total lack of any banking knowledge . 
  does that mean labor should be banned from the ballot ? 
  or that conservatives are immune to it ? 
  also why use a political issue to argue for a economical policy , this kinda starts to look like propaganda . 
  oh silly me , the article is from forbes.com the news source that sees greed as admirable and poverty as a side effect of social policy and the lack of ambition . 
   the labour government of gordon brown sank gbp45 .2 bn ( usd72 .3 bn ) into rbs and yet the demand that it sell off branches means its value is just gbp35bn ( usd56bn ) . 
  the old , `` if we do n't stop them from delapidating we wo n't get our money back '' argument . 
  a classic of being to caught up in the trees to see the forest . 
  politicians today are so scared of change and political rhetoric that they happily sacrifice macroeconomic sanity for the sake of the state budget . 
   given the rise of on-line or internet banking many of the leading five uk clearing banks have divested or shut branches anyway ... in the on-line age the need for a physical branch is rapidly losing its significance . 
  but somehow traditional companies still dominate online and are threatened by any measure that would limit their real life oligopoly.this argument is purely emotional , along the lines , of `` with the * new internets * and *.com s * making all the new money let the old guy enjoy his old fashioned ways , while they still can . '', 
   it would be a better step if instead of playing to the crowd with fine sounding one liners or five second slogans an effort was made to think about the debate over a full hour . 
  great advice , now the author should replace `` crowd '' with `` my readers '' and take it himself . 
   bte block potential entrants from freely entering a market profitably . 
  they protect the market share of the incumbent firms so allowing the preservation of supernormal or monopoly profits in the long run . 
  in short the market is less contestable . 
  something true , but as any entrepreneur can tell you barriers of entry ( you do n't need an acronym for it , only if you want to be pretentious ) are just the start and its effects are limited over medium term , some would argue that they are filter against weak business models with insufficient liquidity and prevent them from entering and overcrowding the bottom end of the market with unsustainable options , but that is another debate . 
  what is not debatable is that a saturated , highly regulated market is a much bigger hurdle for new companies . 
  you could deregulate it , but that would just make the industry more dangerous as i ` ts capacity to self regulate are have been proven to be severely lacking and there is no guarantee that the oligopoly wo n't develop internal mechanism to prevent up-and-comers for threatening their position . 
  option 2 is limit saturation , it has its side effects but if you consider the goal : the health of the market in the long term - it is the best option . 
   this is a hot political potato that is going to be given plenty more cooking time as the election ... just 16 months away draws near . 
  no it is n't a political issue , only with the dawn of neo conservatives being advocated of `` save the corporation , save the country '' has the economy become a pseudopolitical subject , people should not be put into this false dichotomy of economic freedom or social responsibility , because these to are linked ( you ca n't sustainably fund social issues without the first and a system without social measures is illegitimate politically ) , and any form of debate on these pseudo subjects just masks how lobbied conservative measures are and how populist liberal measures are . 
  itt : chauvinist that do n't want to share the eu prestige with another easterner and mask it by pretending to care about ukrainian sovereignty and young idealist who want to satisfy their fantasy about a unified europa but mask it as concern for pro western ukrainians . 
   look at the comments on reddit for example any time there is a protest here , the vast majority of the top comments are insulting them in some way or another . 
  or talking about how police action was justified or that `` we do n't know the full picture '' . 
  what are you subscribed to ? 
   this is just politics for most people when you wo n't be able to afford heating your house and food in the same month , you do n't talk about politics . 
  this is about a bureaucratic ruling class that sacrifices progress and their citizens well being because they do n't want to lose power . 
  a generation x and y that refuses to shut up and take the status quo , because they know what could be . 
  i suppose you could extend the meaning of poliitics , to reframe it in a historical , philosophic and social context so this would qualify as politics , but in that case these movements not only qualify as real politics , but because they are real paradigm shifts that define generations and change the future of nations are more `` political '' than any of our democratic pseudointelectual rhetoric carried out by wealthy politicians and moderated by sensationalist journalists . 
  all of our `` politics '' are pale , lack vigor , motive , they seem to be a charade , a puppet show interpreting the real thing , a lie we are satified with and accept as sufficient . 
  pesky plebs , how dare they !, 
  exactly , and that glorification affects their judgement , sorry dude , i do n't get frustrated by social injustice . 
  so did slavery and absolute monarchies but we kinda agree that they are n't good ideas . 
  every thing you said is valid , but from my perspective , those visits cost money , and usually you leave some wine and some pastry out for the priest to enjoy . 
  but if you do n't participate in the ritual you are chastised and both the priest and your neighbors look at you like your are having a orgy with the devil himself . 
  religiousness does not mean guaranteed morality , in fact in most cases the more his moral authority goes uncontested ( he is contested by his superiors for his actions , politically not morally ) , the more his ego decides what is and what is n't right . 
  a truly moral preacher can see how selfish and abusive manipulating voters is , while a self righteous egomaniac considers that the he is beyond fault and therefor the act of doing something makes it morally legitimate . 
  also those chats , are exactly the opposite of physiotherapy , instead of assurance and acceptance of ones faults they are used to shame and control , especially in a small rural community where the preacher has a loose tongue and a drinking habit . 
  and high church officials listen to high political officials they are as disconnected from the public as royalty , and as royalty they 're decision to support one candidate or another is incontestable by the rest of the church . 
  really do n't want to start a religious debate because that is not my point , despite being a atheist i do n't care about peoples beliefs , but i believe that organised religion ( churches , clergy , doctrines ) has been the most destructive and limiting creation of of human imagination trough all of written history . 
  they are the only institution that is untouchable by the press , by the public , by politicians and even tax collectors . 
  it is unhealthy psychologically for a person to be so beyond reproach but still be considered a moral rock . 
  debatable , republicans are assholes in the same way democrats are hedons or fiscally irresponsible , they are perceived this way only because of the political juxtaposition . 
  the church ultimately is made of people , that happen to enjoy a privileged moral position . 
  some people see this as a moral obligation to be better that the rest of us , others use this to make personal gains . 
  political figures realize that religious support is the poor man 's pr , and as i previously stated some preachers are n't above that . 
  after a while this type of behavior becomes systemic ( long tangent , i wo n't go into it ) and as religious leaders realize how dependant politicians are and use that to inact social `` reform '' , because they truly believe that this would be for the best . 
  and because they lived most of their lives in a moral high ground they `` know '' they hold the moral `` truth '' . 
  have you seen the one about the [ exorcist in ukraine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk65kdavnxi ) , really hit home that one , yo see how the self strives for hope and acceptance despite living in a indifferent arbitrary reality . 
  long story short , without starting metaphysical debates , poverty and ignorance are optimal conditions for spiritual predators , some are official and present themselves as ortodox preachers others are modern evangelists that do it for the money , despite identifying as ortodox i am quite certain they are not , they are simple naive people that lived hard lives according to a culturally rigid code of conduct , and now are confronted with a increasingly unrecognizable post-existential world and seek understanding and solidarity in the first `` institution '' they encounter . 
  no , corruption , cronyism and evangelism got in the way, 
  did n't they maintain a clause after annexation that puts them in a privileged position to do so ? 
  very interesting , thanks for the feedback, 
  then why not let them go , beyond the nationalist bullshit , does madrid have any valid arguments ? 
  in this limited context both believe their nation is oppressed by the eu, 
  i blame the church , putin was always authoritarian but the totalitarian aspect only became apparent in this mandate , since he became closer to the russian church to gather public support after he barely `` won '' the last election . 
  this brotherhood of politics and church is quite prevalent in my country to , and its disturbing how well they can stifle liberalism and cultural progression . 
  what would happen with spain 's budget if catalonia and the basque country would seccede ? 
  how would scottish independence affect the balance between conservative and labour in the rest of the uk ? 
  because the other party cares even less about privacy and basically believe the us is mandated by god to rule the earth, 
   that a neo-nazi party is on the march , funny how his message was actually compatible with their rethoric, 
  because it 's expensive to offer services in 23 diferent languages , to 28 different cultures that vary in behavior . 
  on the other side , if the eu would be as interested to tech as it is to agriculture maybe we would grow a tech scene that does n't need silicon valley 's framework and vc . 
  also related ted talk : [ about the goverment 's crucial role in tech developemnt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1ipsldbbg ), 
  why do people think i 'm referring to skin color , in a community you know what house is jewish , who are muslim or christian . 
  and in practice a teenage muslim will be perceived differently than a christian one . 
  italians are doing very well , sweden and the uk could learns some things about fiscal responsibility and social progress from them apparently . 
  but are distinguishable by the community they live in . 
  again are muslims and christians really in the same position ? 
   i expect that the uk will end the quantitative easing programme within the next 12 months i 'll take that bet , but i honestly hope you 're right . 
  exactly , move outside of the eu , but the eu is the second biggest market in the world , so they would have to choose if they want to make money from financial services ( that would have been exempt under a certain value under the french tax model ) or derivatives juggling ( which does n't produce organic economic growth so we do n't need it anyway ) . 
  again it 's not about the actual tax income , it 's about presenting a unified front . 
  i would love a lib dem uk to balance out socialist france or conservative germany , hell i 'd even be ok with a progressive tory , but not a political puppet like cameron . 
  every move he makes is to appease his septuagenarian electorate ( i know the appearance of new britain he is pushing but his actions scream god king and country ), 
   retail banking from wholesale banking you mean comercial banking from finacial services ? 
   whether it has been a good policy remains to be seen .

  how is not relevant after what / u/adriang133 said ?!, 
  it 's more like a `` i live in this area '' thing . 
  if you look for me in / r/askeurope you 'll see that i do n't have a hungarian flair there  . 
  neither am i unfortunately . 
  i rather not hope for such a thing . 
  a huge country with nuclear capabilities in chaos , would made wwii look like a hide and seek game . 
  especially if that country is russia . 
  oh hehehe ... do n't worry , i 'm not a nationalist . 
  i 'm not even ethnically romanian . 
  it bothers me because i find russian influence there is toxic even for our country and because i kinda care about those people in moldova who are n't brainwashed . 
  i do n't exactly want a unification by the way . 
  kinda like i had last week when i was in munich and i 've heard romanian hahaha, 
  well , many have a lot of mixture in them due to slavery . 
  i mean an aristocrat in 17 century wallachia would n't exactly ask for permission to have sex with a gypsy woman who was his property anyway . 
  they ca n't be forced imo . 
  the only way would be to have a real democracy in russia and not even then you can be sure they 'll be reasonable enough to leave . 
  as we can see in our neighbourhood , even in ( more or less ) stable democracies , nationalism is n't a thing very easy to overcome and ignore if you want votes . 
  it 's more like we 're still recovering after the 40s and what follows it . 
  such is life in eastern europe . 
  the `` vibrant diversity '' left for france , uk , sweden etc, 
  it looks worse than what we have in my village . 
  well , there are gypsy `` families '' ( clans ?! ), 
  who look pale like the second boy in the right ( the one close to the teacher ) . 
  it all depends of how much * cough * * cough * genetic input they got in the past from the local population . 
   e.g. 
  in eastern europe ?!, 
  e : in here the 90s were quite horrible . 
  from an economic and fashion point of view . 
  only the 80s we 're worse . 
  not in my school . 
  but i 'm sure those exists in romania . 
  yeah right . 
  as much as it bothers me to say it , russians are there to stay . 
  no matter how many resolutions , laws and requests will be voted by the moldovan parliament . 
  and by `` russians '' i mean their army and influence , not the people since i have nothing against normal people no matter how brainwashed they are . 
  i 've heard it in prahova . 
  also there are villages in prahova and d\u00e2mbovi\u021ba where bulgarian `` refugees '' were settled ( back in the 17-18 century ) and people call the inhabitants `` cepari '' . 
  til m\u0103m\u0103liga is cool !, 
  well it kinda is ... with sour cream hehehe, 
  that could be the case indeed . 
  til , 
  you 're welcome . 
  and here is another nickname romanians have for bulgarians . 
  i reckon that you 're quite right here . 
  etaj and garaj are borrowed from french , i think . 
  hran\u0103 must be from you though . 
   oh , but i always see it on www.dnevnik.bg when i read the comments ( thank you google translate ) under an article about romania . 
  i 've found two in one millisecond . 
   unfortunately despite having a ton of common words , both languages are quite different and in no way mutually intelligible . 
  * mamaligarite * is something i kinda hate at your people though . 
  i do n't even like that kind of dish !, 
  serbian refugees ?!, 
  c'mon , it 's not like she 's the empress of eu . 
  her power and influence have limits . 
  plus that salad . 
  shop salad ? 
  we had 40 degrees one week ago . 
  i think i can handle . 
  since when merkel signs the papers for eu funds ?!, 
  you 'll be lucky if dracula would come for you . 
  no mister , i 'll come for your arse and i 'm very pis ` ed * off !, 
  : ^ p ( * for our polish friends ), 
  a rumour is not a fact . 
  they 'll get only hate from their friends even . 
  if it 's terrorism i 'd rather look beside your neighbour 's head . 
  that 's because we are . 
  western europe map has 15k karma and our map has less than 6 hundred and this is exactly how we are irl unfortunately . 
  well , that 's life . 
  that neighbour ca n't be that crazy . 
  he/she ca n't win anything from such a thing but hate from everyone . 
  i rather put all my money on stupid people . 
  stupidity is a heavy burden humanity must carry . 
  those stories involves one of your neighbouring country somehow ? 
  we really do n't need * those * * things * again in our neighbourhood . 
  starting fire on purpose ?!, 
  what the hell ? 
  i do n't want to believe that !, 
  but if i 'll have a car with gps and a road who goes where 's no fire ... 
  we 're a minority unfortunately . 
  then use everything you have to save lives . 
  f. . k the buildings !, 
  and as a country girl , born and raised , i advise you to use a corner ( as in where the fire is lowering ) and go from there . 
  do n't you ever fight it against the wind cuz you 'll loose big time , go with it . 
  damn , now i give you advices like we 're some firemen lol . 
  i really do n't want to see dead people on the news . 
  hmmmm pickled roses ?!? 
  that 's something i never thought about . 
  ask for those countries who can get into the air then !, 
  lifes are way more important than national pride . 
  for southern romanians , bulgarians are great gardners . 
  they grow lots of vegetables . 
  in the winter you eat pickled veggies . 
  you never hope that about the wind . 
  if you 're close to the fire move your arse out of there !, 
  does any other country help them ? 
  if not , ask for help guys !, 
  our best friends . 
  even if none of us realize it yet . 
   they ~ ~ love ~ ~ ~ ~ roses ~ ~ ** are ** pickles fixed your ftfy, 
  i 'd rather wo n't talk about my political opinions here .

actually , geographically , latvia is pretty eastern european . 
  i did n't say transylvania was perfect . 
  it 's still romania , not fucking germany , i just said it 's the least crappiest place . 
  we have stinky people , bad drivers and moa\u0219te kissers , just not in such epic proportions . 
  washing every other day is not as bad , i 've met people from oltenia that wash a few times a year and boil the toothbrushes they have since the 90s and only use for special occasions . 
  europe clearly does n't like what russia is doing but unfortunately russia has natural resources , ukraine does n't have shit , so compromises are made . 
  i do n't agree with you , every country must fight for it 's own freedom . 
  whenever the west intervenes they always seem to turn a shithole nobody cares about into a larger shithole that suddenly everyone cares about . 
  a nato military intervention in ukraine during the euromaidan would n't have had popular support anywhere , not in europe , not in russia , not even in ukraine . 
  in romania we have a saying that goes `` ho\u021bul strig\u0103 ho\u021bii !, 
  '' , which means `` thief screams thieves ! '' . 
  novorossia is a perfect example of nazis calling others nazi . 
  or maybe drop a neutron bomb and reclaim the land . 
  we already have a shithole in europe : transnistria ^ tm - shipping arms around the world since 1992 , we do n't need another one . 
  he ca n't be ukrainian because he betrayed his country , so either you guys accept him as being russian or stop meddling in eastern ukraine ... 
  i 'm starting to think that everyone in the separatist regions who is not fucked up in the head fled during the war . 
  the ones who remain seem to all be fubar either from birth , or became like this during the war . 
  it 's also a little funny , because there are quite a few women serving in the `` novorussian army '' afaik . 
  well , with transylvania still being the least crappiest place in a country as crappy as romania currently is , it 's only normal we feel some resentments against southerners because the vast majority of romanian leaders in recent history came from the south ( ceau\u0219escu , iliescu , n\u0103stase , b\u0103sescu , t\u0103riceanu , ponta ) . 
  another political reason we hate southerners and moldavians is because they tend to vote for the social democrats . 
  in fact , even the 20 % that ponta got in timi\u0219 county were mostly the oltenians , moldavians and gypsies living here . 
  excluding politics from the equation , we do n't really like southerners , because honestly , most of them are pretty uncivilized . 
  i 'm not generalizing , but whenever i see an idiot in traffic , he seems to either have a mh or a b plate . 
  also , while i was still in uni , i found out many students from the oltenia region had some serious hygiene problems . 
  these are just a few examples , more reasons can be found , i 've met great people from all parts of the country , but honestly , i think transylvania should have some degree of autonomy , financial at the very least . 
  yeah same situation in romania . 
  victor ponta is considered , among others , a plagiarist , a puppet , a potential tyrant and a corrupt asshole . 
  actually , if you search google for `` plagiator '' ( the romanian word for `` plagiarist '' ) , his name comes up third in the results . 
  yet he appeals to brainless , hopeless , lazy benefit claiming fucks and will most likely become president later this month . 
  very sad . 
  from the wikipedia article it seems like the guy is a corrupt , thuggy , xenophobic piece of **** . 
  and he was prime minister , eastern europeans clearly have bones in their brains . 
  still , setting yourself on fire seems like the most painful ways to die that i can think of , there are better alternatives , like throwing yourself in front of a moving train or leaping from a building . 
  there was an idiot in romania a couple of months ago that supposedly wanted to set himself on fire in front of the romanian government . 
  however , he was just an attention whore , in 2009 he jumped from a balcony inside the parliament . 
  [ government incident ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teper0kuuyq ) [ parliament incident ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrckhljpz3e ), 
  you obviously do n't get the point , do you ? 
  the picture illustrates the choice that romanians have to make between two evils . 
  iohannis is n't a nazi and ponta is n't an old time commie , but they are representatives of the left and right , so what better way to portray them ? 
  not surprised about eastern romania at all . 
  the moldavians are always in the news , i thought it would be worse . 
  to clarify , when i referred to europe , i was referring to the eu+s witzerland + norway + iceland . 
  yes , uk laws do not automatically apply to europe , but there have been attempts in other european countries to create laws that affect internet freedom ( in romania for example , there was a law proposal a few years ago , that would have forced news websites to censor vulgar or derogatory comments ) . 
  hungary under orban is also well known for doing it 's best to limit press freedom . 
  yep , that 's one of the perks of democracy . 
  fortunately for putin and unfortunately for us , the russian is an incredibly resilient species , if they did n't rebel against jugashvili , they wo n't rebel against putin . 
  last time i checked , the uk was a member of the eu . 
  same with hungary . 
  yeah , fuck reality , it has an anti-russian bias . 
  i never had any illusions about rt , ever . 
  it was always a propaganda tool , i doubt anyone with an above average iq ever thought anything else . 
  how can we expect russia to become like europe , when in fact , with every new stupid law , europe is resembling russia more and more ? 
  there are many fat gypsies , i.e. 
  europistan in the making . 
  i 've been to southern moldova a few years ago . 
  i 'm betting that even rural north korea looks better than southern moldova . 
  those settlements are illegal anyway , they should just be bulldozed and the occupants shot . 
  problem solved . 
  this is n't just romania 's problem , you will find gypsies living like this spain , france , uk etc. 
  they will always live like this because they are lazy as fuck as fuck and actually like living like shit . 
  romania has been in the eu for over 7 years , have you been living under a rock ? 
  the us also spies on it 's allies . 
  foreign intelligence services are important for every country that cares about it 's sovereignty and independence , and i fully support them as long as they do their job . 
  however , i think there should be a clear line between intelligence and politics . 
  from a moral perspective and what should be a legal perspective as well , once you choose a career in intelligence ( foreign or domestic ) you should never be allowed to get into politics . 
  if you are , well that 's an attack on democracy itself . 
  that does n't change things . 
  he was still incompatible by being a prosecutor at the same time , which at the very least means he had zero respect for the constitution of the country which he was ( and currently still is ) supposed to be serving . 
  no sane person should take something like this lightly . 
  as a side note , putin was also a foreign intelligence officer , but even someone like him had the decency to admit it . 
  you do n't know basescu does n't have evidence . 
  if he did n't , this would be like shooting himself in the foot and besides , ponta could easily sue him . 
  while i do n't like basescu ( or udrea for that matter ) , ponta is simply much worse . 
  a power hungry sociopath , that will stop at nothing until he and his friends have total control of the country : government , justice , economy and media . 
  did you forget when he did everything he could to cover up the plagiarism scandal ? 
  heck , the hungarian president quit and he did n't even plagiarise as much as ponta . 
  and it was n't basescu who said ponta plagiarised , but reputable international sources , which in no plausible scenario could be controlled by basescu . 
  the psd 's whole election campaign , all the public agenda for the past 9 years has been to `` rid romania of basescu '' . 
  he was likened to a dictator , a despot , the root of all fucking evil in romania . 
  hell , i saw brainwashed idiots that blamed basescu for getting fired . 
  no one else in the international community , not the eu , not the us ever accused basescu of being autocratic , but all that has changed since ponta took charge . 
  everyone is comparing him now with the other viktor . 
  again , are you as stupid to say that basescu controls the us and eu ? 
  idk about other countries , but in romania , cabbies are the absolute worst pieces of shit you might encounter . 
  they ignore traffic rules , they take `` shortcuts '' to get you paying more , in some cities they even have some devices that they connect to the taxing machine , which they activate when you are n't looking and charge 4 times the normal amount . 
  not to mention they feel super privileged , even parking on narrow one way streets , blocking the traffic while they wait for their customers ... 
  romania has some of the fastest and most affordable internet connections in the eu . 
  i would feel sorry for someone who asked me if we had internet . 
  from experience , the best way to piss off a romanian is to act like you do n't know the difference between roma and romanian , that 's bound to get a heavy emotional response , but be careful , you might end up with a couple of stitches . 
  if you ca n't tell the difference that means you should go back to school and learn some history . 
  lamborghini with fake license plate and fake driver 's license ... 
  i was being sarcastic . 
  i 'm sick of all this fighting with communist ghosts , while our country has been ransacked in a very capitalist way . 
  that woman who is asking for 100.000 euros for the suffering of her husband is ridiculous . 
  why should i and most other taxpayers who were n't even born at that time have to pay for that ? 
  yeah , visinescu should be sent to prison if his guilty , let him spend the rest of his days in a prison cell , but i do n't agree for the government to pay any damages to the ( families of ) the victims . 
  yeah they tried to do that in romania too , it was ruled unconstitutional ( i am referring to requesting ids for prepaid sim cards ) . 
  new zealand , they 're small , prosperous and their culture is close to ours . 
  yeah , then we can be official vassals of the us . 
  hooray !,

  the eu does have `` integration '' programs , but i have yet to hear about a success story . 
  all i hear is graft or people with neonazi opinions doing gypsy integration programs . 
  for underfunded hospitals , the obvious solution would be to increase funding ( we currently have the lowest healthcare spending as percentage of gdp in the eu ) . 
  however there 's this idea looming about privatizing hospitals and using private insurance companies . 
  of course , this would mean far better services for the top 5 % ( who can afford such services ) and worse services ( or at least , worse coverage ) for the rest of 95 % . 
  i see way too often the `` lazy people do n't deserve healthcare '' argument . 
  if by fiscal responsibility you mean bad infrastructure , [ extreme poverty ] ( http://www.romanialibera.ro/usr/thumbs/thumb_506_x_340/2010/08/21//139778-romi.jpg ) and [ underfunded hospitals ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sieusddb7ds/tamoydsyiji/aaaaaaaaali/j85ipb5ubj0/s1600/spital.jpg ) , i do n't want any . 
  [ that flag is what they see out the window during the winter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:eesti_lipp.jpg ), 
   the carabiniere ( a member of a sort of police branch of the army ) , which is stereotypically considered a simpleton or straight dumb . 
  a year ago , as a tourist in rome , around the colosseum , i saw a carabinieri car speeding up , toward some africans selling trinkets . 
  those africans ran away fast , jumping a fence and climbing a slope , narrowly escaped being hit by that police car , which screeched its brakes when it reached the edge of the road . 
  after that , they just got out of the car and laughed at the scared africans . 
  some more details : * oltenia : stupid , but they think they are very ingenious and inventive * moldavia : poor and alcoholic * transylvania : patriarchal ( shepherds , sheep shaggers , etc ) , very slow ( both in thinking and acting ) , drink palinc\u0103 / palinka that is much stronger than what 's produced in the other areas of course , most common jokes are about the oltenians . 
  some samples : -- * how do the oltenians build a fence ? 
  * they put two stakes and then they write `` etc. '', 
  -- * why do the oltenian men wear checkered shirts ? 
  * so they can ask their wife `` scratch me at h3 ! '', 
  -- * why do the oltenians put their clocks on their windows ? 
  * so they can see how time flies . 
  -- * why do n't the oltenians practice waterskiing ? 
  * they have no lake with a slope . 
  -- * why do the oltenians sleep on the soil ? 
  * so they become more cultivated . 
  we had the same thing in romania . 
  romania 's peak population was 23.2 million in 1990 . 
  in 2011 , there were only 18.3 million people who were living permanently in romania . 
  almost 5 million people lost in 20 years , most of them to other eu countries . 
  do we have a more competent government ? 
  definitely not . 
  i do n't think the catalans will be cowed by the madrid bullies . 
   would do best for greece . 
  if the minimum wage is lowered , more working-age people will simply leave the country to work for the minimum wages in other eu countries . 
  this has already happened in poland , in romania , in bulgaria , etc. 
  the government will get fewer taxes and it would make the debt less manageable . 
  yes , that 's best for greece . 
  i can see some intense competition for bakers : there can be dozens of bakeries around and dozens of other brands of bread you can buy in supermarkets . 
  this competition is good for the customer . 
  but there 's little competition for telecom companies . 
  where i live , there are only two companies with wide coverage across the country : vodafone and orange . 
  they have basically the same prices , similar quality , etc. 
  you basically choose whether you like red or orange . 
  they do n't appear to try to take each other 's customers : they 're happy with the profit margin . 
  the prices for data roaming are absurdly high . 
  there is absolutely no reason , technical or otherwise , for vodafone to charge me 100 times more if i cross the border into hungary ( and using the services of vodafone hungary ) than when i 'm in romania . 
   just support those companies that do not charge roaming fees and stop supporting those who charges them . 
  if all companies charge roaming fees , whom should i support ? 
  the republic of cyprus, 
  the only connection i can see is that he studied at the pontifical biblical institute in rome . 
  the problems with traceability have been known for a long time . 
  it 's not like it never happened that a horse/cow/whatever that was supposed to be sacrificed , according to the paper trail , to be found roaming across the countryside . 
  great !, 
  am i the only atheist who enjoys papal elections ? 
  nobody expects the [ sacred congregation for the doctrine of the faith ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_ratzinger_as_prefect_of_the_congregation_for_the_doctrine_of_the_faith ) . 
   the standards of living and the standards of their benefits schemes vary wildly between eu nations . 
  i thought that one of the goals of the eu was to have equal economic development/standards of living . 
  the schemes can be standardized , if there is enough will . 
   so i was wondering what you guys think about the demographic crisis europe is suffering right now . 
  in romania , we face an overwhelming outward migration . 
  millions of ( mostly young ) romanians left already for better-paid positions in western europe . 
  in italy alone , there are over a million romanian citizens . 
  i 'm not complaining about this : they have better perspectives there and i do n't see a point in our nationalists ' cries about how they 'll be assimilated and cease to be romanians . 
  nevertheless , i see a worrying trend : if millions of people from eastern europe in their 20s and 30s leave ( the same is valid for poland , bulgaria , etc ) , there 's an even more serious demographic crisis here than in western europe . 
  if most young people leave and the older people stay behind , how is our social-security system going to work ? 
  we already have more pensioneers than employed people . 
  the only solution for this would be to have a common eu-wide social security pool , but i know that this will not be accepted easily by the western countries . 
  maybe i 'm a gypsy too , and i want my kind to conquer your people . 
  today romania , tomorrow the world !, 
   that would mean we would have to give gypsies the entire country . 
  are the roma people the majority in the entire country ? 
  if we exclude the romanian-inhabited villages of harghita and covasna , the hungarian-inhabited area has ~ 95 % hungarians . 
  is this the same as the 5-10 % roma people elsewhere ? 
  no one is asking autonomy for 100-people villages . 
  the szekely are a special case because they are a 700.000-people nation living in a compact and homogenous area . 
   hey everyone , catalonia ca n't use its own flag cause they 're spanish !, 
  in catalonia , the local authorities fly the [ catalan province flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/flag_of_catalonia.svg/210px-flag_of_catalonia.svg.png ) , not the '' [ senyera estelada ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--lpxdhwkmo4/t8yscy8nshi/aaaaaaaaa9u/uqshnvamcww/s1600/estelada.png ) '' ( independent catalunya flag , the one with the star ) . 
  also , it 's not a human right to fly a flag inside government buildings . 
  the arguments against giving them autonomy are : * `` our ancestors died fighting austria-hungary '' -- of course , they died for liberating the areas inhabited by romanians , the szkeler enclave was included because it 's an enclave , not because it was `` romanian land '' . 
  * `` the romanian minority in szekeler land '' -- the argument goes that the romanian minority will be oppressed , but , that 's nonsense , as they could be granted the same rights which the hungarian minority have in the rest of romania . 
  ( education , using their maternal language in dealing with the local authorities , etc ) * `` the szekely came here after us '' -- they came here 1000 years ago and the area was n't inhabited by romanians before that . 
  in some areas of romania , there were no romanians at all until 150 years ago . 
  should dobruja be given back to the ottomans ? 
  * `` the constitution says we have a unitary state '' -- the constitution can be changed . 
   we support our own agriculture , we do n't use funds from other nations there are us states that pay more than they get back in subsidies and states that benefit from the subsidies ( iowa , for instance ) . 
   i feel that scotland is a predominantly left wing country and england is a predominantly right wing country imo , this is probably the most powerful argument in all this debate . 
   problems with flooding . 
  probably it has something to do with the submarine 's sinks . 
  `` ironhead '' actually sounds like a cool name . 
  i 'd be more embarassed by a name like p\u0103s\u0103ric\u0103 ( `` pussy '' , literally birdie ) or curu\u021b ( can be understood as smallarse , but its actual etymology is ultimately from german kreuz [ fahrer ] , `` crusader '' ), 
  is n't that the logo of winamp ? 
  that was just an example , but which i found an illustration quite good for the kind of mentality in greece . 
  it 's not hard to see that this is the prevalent mentality in greece . 
  the people of greece gave up the fight for their country and accepted whatever imf and eu are telling them . 
  young people now prefer to leave the country instead of fighting for something better than the deal they got . 
  of course there are some exceptions , but i feel that they 're only that , exceptions . 
  otherwise , they could n't have made a whole country accept those terms . 
  westernized ? 
  czech republic 2 . 
  slovenia easternized ? 
  greece . 
  why greece ?

  wow ... 
  i mean i expect it from the ft , but i had more respect for reuters . 
   you ca n't call him stupid for believing what the news told him . 
  umm ... 
  i 'm pretty sure that one of the definitions of stupid . 
  if all he knows on this topic is what the daily mail told him than i certainly can call him stupid , both for his ignorance of the topic he 's commenting on and for the fact that he trusts the daily mail or whatever british tabloid he reads . 
  while that 's true , that 's not really the reason deflation is hugely bad . 
  it 's bad because the attitude it imprints on market participants . 
  if there is deflation that means prices are dropping , which means that you as an average guy with a limited amount of money will put off buying anything you can right now knowing that tomorrow/next week/etc the price on the thing you want to buy will probably be lower . 
  this attitude applied to entire populations leads to a crash in demand for goods , which in turn leads to even further deflation . 
  this whole process is called a deflationary cycle and it 's one of the most toxic and hardest to get out of economic phenomenon . 
   deflation is good for the countries economy as a whole wow ... so much stupid in such a small sentence , it 's really quite amazing . 
  this is pretty much the only way to negotiate with russia currently . 
  they do something you do n't like , you do something they do n't like and end up with some form of negotiated settlement at some point . 
  it 's not odd at all , it 's retaliation for the ukraine situation . 
  if anything it was expected , if not this than something else . 
  do these people think it 's called `` the world 's oldest profession '' because it does n't have staying power during the banned periods ? 
  nothing good will come of this . 
  good luck with that , do n't let the door hit you . 
  you do n't have to image it , since i already did it . 
  i do n't think that word means what you think it means . 
  you should probably look it up in a dictionary , you should n't have a problem doing that , seeing as you 're british and all . 
  because the ue is n't based on seniority , i have just as much right to tell you to fuck off as any other guy . 
  if you do n't like it , do n't let the door hit you on the way out . 
  not important enough to put up with your shit . 
  either get it together or leave . 
  the ue would certainly benefit from having the uk stay there 's no question of that , but only if the uk gets it 's shit together and stops crying and asking for special rights every other day . 
  the uk is nowhere near as important as it thinks itself . 
  it 's amusing that you think that 's some positive news about russia . 
  russia is trying to get the eu to accept some trilateral talks about a bilateral trade agreement by blackmailing ukraine and the eu is having none of it . 
   moldova will never joing the eu . . nobody wants us there ( maybe just the east europe countries , but not the major powers like germany , france , uk ) . 
  of course they want you to join , even if you do n't consider the fact that it 's a new market and more population to your economic zone , germany and france will want you to join just to keep moldova away from russia 's customs union . 
  in the grand scheme of things , the costs of allowing moldova to join are not that big , since moldova is n't that big . 
   but you know whats the problem ... romanians from romania ( as i see in this thread ) are thinking too much from the materialistic point of view . 
  and this makes me sad oh i 'm sorry i 'm in no hurry to part with more of my money than i already am for some nationalistic gesture i do n't care about . 
  you really think the difference between romania and moldova is the quality of the roads ? 
  just a short search on google tells me that average nominal gdp per capita for the year 2012 for [ moldova ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2013/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2011&amp;ey=2015&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;pr1.x=46&amp;pr1.y=8&amp;c=921&amp;s=ngdpd%2cngdpdpc&amp;grp=0&amp;a= ) was around $ 2000 , while for [ romania ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2013/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=58&amp;pr.y=5&amp;sy=2011&amp;ey=2018&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=968&amp;s=ngdpd%2cngdpdpc%2cpppgdp%2cppppc&amp;grp=0&amp;a= ) it was $ 8000 . 
  do n't kid yourselves , moldova is much poorer than romania is , but on the other hand romania is simply to poor to afford a union at this time . 
  moldova 's best chance is joining the eu and using eu cohesion funds to close the gap between it and the other countries . 
  oh really ? 
  you think somebody will give us the money for such an empty and nationalistic goal ? 
  i 'm not sure if you 're naive or delusional . 
  thank god the moldavian people are mostly against a union , because with the idiot politicians romania has in power they might actually try to do the union if they really could . 
  there 's no way that romania can actually finance a union at this time , or at any time in a near future , one only needs to look the the german reunification and see how much that costed to understand that fact . 
  people would be willing to bankrupt the country just to push some nationalist agenda that does ' t matter anyway since moldova will join the eu in the next 10 years most likely . 
  from what i 've read it 's intended that the high speed rail line connect vienna - bucharest - constanta , which means that it will almost certainly pass through budapest , so it 's very likely it will happen . 
  this article is so badly written and biased i had to check i was n't reading it on rt.com, 
  this is incredibly false , where did you get that propaganda ? 
  ukraine always seemed like a bridge too far kind of a situation . 
  ca n't really say i 'm surprised . 
  agreed . 
  op seems to be looking for a money is no object kind of thing , in which case i 'm sure there are better places , but i 've been in zell am see-kaprun for 3 weeks last winter and i have nothing but 5 stars to give . 
  also went to ski in saalbach several days during that trip and in some respects i think it 's even better than zell am see-kaprun . 
  i second saalbach or zell am see-kaprun area . 
  amazing place to ski . 
   eastern europe there 's a trend to increase land / house taxes and reduce employee taxes . 
  i 'll need a source on that , my taxes have n't been lowered ever since i started working . 
   also , homes need constant repairs and people often forget that . 
  repairs which would n't be done if you were renting ? 
   finally , it reduces your mobility !!!!, 
  if you lose a job , then you may be unable to sell it , move or find another job . 
  not really a problem if you 're living in a large urban city , moving cities for a new job is n't something that 's done around here . 
  if i 'll move i 'm moving to the west , not another city in romania . 
  also demand for apartments in bucharest at least is huge , there 's no way you would n't find a buyer for it . 
  not really unexpected to be honest . 
  in my experience the rent you would pay on an apartment would be almost the same as the sum you 'd pay to the bank each month for the loan you took to buy the same apartment . 
  given that situation owning something is better than not owning it and still paying the same money every month . 
  i guess this means our rents are way to high or home prices are way to low than they should . 
  do n't really know which is right , but after checking home prices in other european cities i think the rent prices are very high . 
  completely legal and not really that uncommon to be honest . 
  deflation now available at a eurozone near you !, 
  call now !, 
  words change meaning all the time , what makes this time a sad development ? 
  just because the word had another meaning a long time ago , means nothing . 
  words change meanings all the time . 
  what neoliberal meant in the 30s and what it means now are completely separate concepts , but it does n't mean one is right and one is wrong . 
  if you 're just going to copy-paste from wikipedia at least paste everything . 
   in the 1960s , usage of the term `` neoliberal '' heavily declined . 
  when the term was reintroduced in the 1980s in connection with augusto pinochet 's regime , the usage of the term had shifted . 
  it had not only become a term with negative connotations employed principally by critics of market reform , but it also had shifted in meaning from a moderate form of liberalism to a more radical and laissez-faire capitalist set of ideas . 
  scholars now tended to associate it with the theories of economists friedrich hayek and milton friedman . 
  [ 2 ] once the new meaning of neoliberalism was established as a common usage among spanish-speaking scholars , it diffused directly into the english-language study of political economy . 
  [ 3 ] the term `` neoliberal '' is now used mainly by those who are critical of legislative initiatives that push for free trade , deregulation , enhanced privatization , and an overall reduction in government control of the economy . 
  maybe so , but at least it describes reality . 
  if that 's what you take away from that little story than i get to call you a moron , it 's just the way it goes . 
  please stop trying to rationalize what might or might not have happened in a discussion that might or might not have happened just to further your point which is mind numbingly stupid to begin with . 
  you 're making yourself look more moronic than the guy that originally posted this little story and rapidly reaching the level of stupidity of the audience member in his story . 
  i could write a post explaining to you why not only are you wrong on thinking that the euro would be dead without germany , but also wrong on thinking this is about footing any bills , but i wo n't since from your simpleton reply denotes the fact that you do n't have the slightest idea what the issue with the eurozone is . 
  umm i think you need to check with the ecb on this , but currently there is a real risk that the eurozone will fall into a deflation crises , that 's exactly the reason the ecb has been lowering rates . 
  i did n't say wealth transfers were likely , but they are a possibility . 
  southern europe leaving the eurozone is one possible solution to the crises , not the only one . 
  another possible solution would be for germany ( primary ) and maybe one or two other countries to leave the eurozone themselves . 
  a third option would be the implementation of permanent and well defined wealth transfer mechanism within the eurozone that would help balance out the current account imbalances within the eurozone . 
  so wait ... your position is that britain should not invest in jobs in the uk because a non-british person might get the job ? 
  that non-british person would pay the same taxes and everything else just like a normal british person would . 
  this argument would be hilarious if it was n't so sad that you think it 's a real argument . 
  every country works for their own interests , that 's true , but no country has gone to the extent that germany has in the last 4-5 years in pursuit of those interests at the expense of so many from across the continent . 
  so yes , absolutely german selfishness . 
  this is a perfect example of german selfishness that has marked their eu policies for the last 4 years or so . 
  during a time when there is a real risk of the eurozone falling into a deflation , germany is worried about inflation and the fact that its savings might lose some value 10 years down the line .

ah ... communism ... . eraticated those old and beutifull buildings and saved this ugly concrete box to show how great respect they have for property . 
  so in german law , when do you transfer the property right in case of estate trading ? 
  after you `` clean '' the estate of your furniture and then give away the keys ? 
  or does the principle of abstraction apply here as well . 
  well , i said it for experts then . 
  right , for us , e.g. 
  we have 3 obligation of the saler in a sale contract . 
  to give the right to buyer ( in abstracto , the power to control , the will to control , different than the good itself ) to give the good that we are trading , and to guarentee ( that remains in buyer 's property ) . 
  art . 
  1672 romanian civil code . 
  but the contract is valide from the moment it is signed . 
  that means the contract starts to have effects in real life . 
  the real right ( property in this case ) is transfered * de plano * from the saler to the buyer . 
  then he must procee to fulfill the rest . 
  for exemple if you sign a contract and dont give the good after , means that you brake your obligations . 
  very nice comparation with the * ius in re * in these two systems . 
  late justice , still justice . 
  well ... about raw meat it says that it 's from romania , but it taste horible , so i do n't buy it . 
  maybe is made in romania , - the product , - but the meat - from the animal - isnt from our farms for sure . 
  too many preservatives for a local product . 
  here is diferent . 
  they bring everything from abroad . 
  the food is terrible . 
  meat is not meat , just salt and water , nobody buys the cans , and its 33 % more expensive ( like a polish guys said ) here in lidl-romania than in lidl-poland . 
  in my opinion , lidl 's stuff isnt cheap at all . 
  kaufland on the other hand ... 
  laserul de la m\u0103gurele , am i assuming right ? 
  why romania doesnt have researchers ... oh yea ... they are all working in other countries . 
  can you also make a short summary of each party . 
  like doctrine , waht they want , who is voting for them , etc, 
  watch and learn europe !, 
  with love from romania . 
  wish you best neighboard ~ romania, 
  america , **** yea !, 
  moldova = transilvania = tara rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 = same people , the name came a lot more lately, 
  how is that car seen there in the nords ? 
  romanians on hungary 's national day : happy national day !, 
  hungarians on romanian 's national day : mourn day for hungary !, 
  not nationalistic . 
  let me explain , here in romania is a special kind of people that want to look smart and pretend they know everything . 
  they try so hard to look smart and impartial that they agree even with those who say that transylvania was stolen , romania is s *** , everything is better outside , etc. 
  my reactions maybe were exagerated but it express the feelings i have for them . 
  they dont do anything to make things better , they just complain on internet ... 
  i ca n't keep my mouth shut when a `` romanian '' calls his own history fake . 
  ( `` great mythological history '' ), 
  if you know so much about history , you should find by now that nothing is pure or perfect in this world . 
  and by comming here on forums to `` share '' your knowledge in a way that does n't help our country 's image , or even worse , bring arguments that help the ones that threaten our homeland is n't the right thing to do . 
  you love history more than your country . 
  got you again , hungarian , with romanian flag . 
  the internet is full with you . 
  stop talking bad about romania and pretend that you are a romania . 
  we dont hate our country , we love it !, 
  i saw that you commend with a hostile atitudine toward romania in multiple commends . 
  by any chance you are a maghyar from covasna ? 
  the internet is full with `` romanians '' that in fact are huns with romanian citezenship . 
  +1 bravo , true romanian here . 
  in romania they are called sa\u0219i, 
  then you know nothing , our religious figures vanished in night and we found them ( most of them dead ) after the fall of communism in prisons . 
  ceusescu hated the church . 
  in bucharest there are tall buildings that hide old churches even if that stupid soviet constitution shit that we had until 89 said that relgion is free for everyone . 
  nobody respected that . 
  lol , true that , things are much more calm here in romania . 
  connection between romanian and albanian ? 
  i am a romanian , and this is fake news !, 
  looks nice , [ here is another picture of it ] ( http://fs.casapoporului.ro/38518f9a1324a39693597e0ddee7384b.jpg ), 
  ** bad word ** rusia !,

   britain because then at least he would face consequences . 
  probably you are right , but we already have heli built under airbus licence . 
  ca n't deny that the bell is superior but we know how to operate puma and superpuma . 
  on the other hand viper or yankey are new stuff for us . 
  so that the romanian people were born . 
  does it looks to you that [ this man ] ( https://www.paginademedia.ro/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19961605_2162843387275314_7283316279959761011_n_508_tb730.jpg ) can be stopped ? 
  airbus was obvious . 
  i am surprised that they choice bell . 
  plus patriot system !, 
  iohannis loves trump . 
  is 101 % for sure bell helicopters . 
  anybody know what poland have in attack helicopter matter ? 
  option where : - sikorski ( lockheed martin ) - ah-1 dracula ( romanian model ) - airbus h 215m ( upgrade version of what we have now ), 
  welcome home !, 
   some that 's the key . 
  buddy , russia gov does n't give a damn thing about what you want . 
  and seeing what my neighbor is doing right now , , for the best , we will buy a new high tech security alarm system for our homeland .

  what, 
  this has nothing to do with policy really . 
  i think holland was a terrible president but i do n't really hate him as a person . 
  same here . 
  a nice gesture that i find funny/kind . 
  at least that 's how i see things . 
  lol . 
  that 's kinda cute ... 
  story ? 
  your government did . 
  the average man/woman in silesia , working to feed their family had nothing to do with the genocide . 
  our german minority was ethnically cleansed by the soviets . 
  my grandmothers family , who died in labour camps in siberia , never took part in any genocide or massacre , neither did the rest of the germans in transylvania who were ethnically cleansed by the communists . 
  this double standard needs to end , in my opinion . 
  the way some people try to justify the ethnic cleansing of germans in eastern europe is simply disgusting . 
  i did walk into this one ... 
  here 's your upvote , now get out . 
  may is just horrible . 
  this will be a lovely comment section ... 
  he is not wrong ... . god i love memri , i have no idea where they even find these imams or '' scholars '' . . 
  i love the pretty diverse representation in the guests as well . 
  from the far-left mullah who said '' please address joseph stalin with the title of '' sheik '' . '', 
  to the far-right '' hitler killed the jews in self defense '' and even libertarians are represented there . 
  a guy said once '' if a man is strong enough , the state has no business in telling him that slaves are legal or illegal '', 
  it 's memri tv they invite all kind of crazy dudes there . 
  it 's owned by some israelis i believe it 's absolute meme worthy . 
  some golden moments include : that time they invited a believer in '' ancient egyptian identity '' , a guy came dressed in ancient egyptian clothes and started arguing that egyptians are not arabs , that mohammed was egyptian and islam was born there . 
  another guy saying '' by allah this individual is even worse then the jews he is - may allah forgive me for uttering this word - an albanian '' or that time a guy beat the reporter . 
  he did n't know jews owned the post and went nuts and hit the women interviewing him . 
  some dudes stopped him : '' ahmed , shame on you for hitting a women !, 
  '' , he answered '' she is egyptian ! '', 
  but my favourite is the cooking show . 
  a dude cooks traditional arab food and people call him to fuck around . 
  a famous caller asked '' bilal , is the dough made with milk of pregnant wahhabi women ? '' . 
  poor guy went nuts and started cursing everyone . 
  it 's truly a hilarious tv post , shoe fights , ancient egyptian , secularists , salafists , nasserists , islamists ... etc all hating one another and creating a treasure trove of memes . 
  there 's no dick and no huge sweating guy yelling like crazy .

  reminds me of a assassins creed moment , in revelations i think . 
  when ezio arrives and speaks with the young suleyman the magnificent , and speaks of '' the fall of constantinople '' and suleyman replies with '' you mean the conquest of konstantiniye ? '', 
  then ezio says '' i guess it 's a matter of perspective '' god damn ac used to be cool ... 
  to call the early insurgency united is wrong , proof being the power-sharing disputes that came afterwards . 
  most mujahadeen factions agreed to some form of unity government . 
  the taliban was mostly born from the groups pakistan funded and supported . 
  it 's a known fact that mullah omar was trained by the pakistani secret services with help from the saudis i should add . 
  not to mention many rank and file soldiers were afghan refugees from pakistan . 
  you did n't answer my question , and completely changed the subject . 
  what does syria and libya have to do with afghanistan ? 
  you just want to shit on the us and what it does in afghanistan without even mentioning the country . 
  the us funded militias and rebels in hundreads of countries all over the world , to try and paint them all with a single brush is simply stupid and counter-productive the taliban literally drove the mujahadeen out of kabul and pushed them into the north , near kunduz . 
  it 's these that we helped . 
  also it was them , not the mujahadeen that hanged the last communist pm , forgot his name . 
  how can the us fund and create the taliban , when they literally fight the mujahadeen government for over 30 years ? 
   who then went on to train the terrorist who killed 22 people in manchester . 
  in the 80 's the cia director complained that there where no volunteers in the mujahadeen forces who wanted to do suicide attacks . 
  again just to show the stupidity of comparing wildly different things . 
  how ? 
  by funding the other side that was against the taliban ? 
  and it 's prisons looked like all the other communist ones . 
  thank you , goodness grace , thank you . 
  whenever people say america funded the taliban i ca n't but cringe .

  there are numerous books i found interesting on saudi , but sadly there is n't really 1 that has '' everything '' . 
  some focus on wahhabism , others on the royal family , some even on aramco and the oil business . 
  try and look to subjects you find interesting . 
  not related to saudi , but i always recomand these , if you have time , try mustafa akyols '' islamic jesus '' and his other book '' islam without extremes a muslim case for liberty '' i found them extremely good , and i think they should be mandatory for everyone who wants to study the region , religion and islamism in a political context . 
  would advise starting with '' the islamic jesus '' , a great book , well worth a read . 
  there are some very good books on amazon , you should check some .

  [ turkish military ] : `` this is the second warning , change direction and leave turkey 's air space '' ... [ drone ] : !? 
  lmao, 
  i 've known a service engineer during a training in germany ( we were there from all of the europe ) . 
  he was from russia and was very content with their government and external affairs . 
  i could n't believe how indoctrinated and/or one-sighted he appeared to be . 
  he had an answer to any question ( such as about democracy , crimea etc ) - directly from the russia 's official propaganda machine . 
  i remember before the romanian revolution , when i was a teenager ( e.g. 
  12 y.o. ), 
  i was explaining - when talking about politics with other kids - ( seems strange but sometimes kids did that , in those times - we had no fb and youtube ) how good socialism was , because everybody had jobs and was being taken care of by the state , while in capitalism they had lots of jobless people and poverty ... lol . 
  well nazis , germans , central powers ( pre-1945 ) ... 
  i just slipped the word nazi instead of `` german army '' without realizing this . 
  it 's my fault , do n't blame the source . 
  well now it has 97 % or 87 % - not sure which one is the approval score . 
  i 'm shocked . 
  i guess it 's a matter of taste ( being a huge sci fi fan i hated `` inception '' too , which also was praised by lots of people ) . 
  otoh i see i 'm not the only one : https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/36bkpn/serious_can_someone_please_explain_why_mad_max/ edit : i thought it was terrible because it had too much kitsch in my opinion and even failed to produce on me the suspension of disbelief required to enjoy a work of fiction . 
  everything seemed forced and implausible . 
   we fought with the turks as allies , as absurd as that may seem absurd ? 
  you were allied with them as members of the central powers , were you not ? 
  romanian occupiers ? 
  i guess all those historians got it wrong about what happened in 1916 . 
  they say bulgaria together with the ~ ~ nazi ~ ~ [ edited as per silence_hr note ] german army invaded dobrudja from south , opening a second front that proved vital for occupying southern romania by the central powers :  while the romanian army was advancing in transylvania , the first counterattack came from field marshal august von mackensen in command of a multi-national force composed of the bulgarian third army , a german brigade and two divisions of the ottoman vi army corps , whose units began arriving on the dobrudja front after the initial battles . 
  this army attacked north from bulgaria , starting on september 1 . 
  it stayed on the south side of the danube river and headed towards constan\u021ba . 
  the romanian garrison of turtucaia , encircled by bulgarian troops ( aided by a column of german troops ) surrendered on september 6 . 
  the romanian third army made further attempts to withstand the enemy offensive at silistra , dobrich , amzacea and topraisar , but had to withdraw under the pressure of superior enemy forces . 
  mackensen 's success was favoured by the allies ' failure to fulfill the obligation they had assumed through the military convention , by virtue of which they had to mount an offensive on the macedonian front and the conditions in which the russians deployed insufficient troops on the battlefront in the south-east of romania . 
  these factors meant that the romanian forces became too strained to put up effective resistance against the enemy advance . 
  romania had to fight on two 1,600 km-long battlefronts , the longest front in europe , with a varied configuration and diverse geographical elements ( by comparison , the russian front , stretching from the baltic sea until bukovina , was only 1,000 km long ) . 
  and later on :  back on the coast , field marshal mackensen and bulgarian general stefan toshev launched a new offensive on october 19 , after a month of careful preparations , and achieved a decisive victory in the second battle of cobadin . 
  the romanians and russians were forced to withdraw out of constan\u021ba ( occupied by the central powers on october 22 ) . 
  after the fall of cernavod\u0103 , the defense of the unoccupied dobruja was left only to the russians , who were gradually pushed back towards the marshy danube delta . 
  the russian army was now both demoralized and nearly out of supplies . 
  mackensen felt free to secretly pull a large number of troops back to the town of svishtov in bulgaria with an eye towards crossing the danube river . 
  and towards the end of 1916 :  on december 1 , the romanian army went ahead with the offensive along the arge\u0219 and neajlov rivers . 
  initially , the romanians experienced success , taking a large number of prisoners , however mackensen was able to shift forces to deal with the sudden assault and falkenhayn 's forces responded with attacks at every point . 
  faced with the overwhelming superiority of the invading forces , the romanian army , its ranks thinned from the previous actions , inferior in equipment and lacking russian support , failed to check the enemy advance . 
  although it recorded numerous daring actions ( among these the prunaru charge , in which the 2nd ro\u015fiori cavalry regiment was almost wiped out ) , the battle of arge\u015f-neajlov ended unfavourably for the romanian army . 
  within three days , the attack had been shattered and the romanians were retreating everywhere . 
  bucharest was captured on december 6 by falkenhayn 's cavalry . 
  the romanian second army made a fighting retreat to the siret river , which had originally been fortified against the russians and was facing the wrong direction but nevertheless would end up proving invaluable , protected by the impassable danube delta to the southeast and a flank in the carpathians in the northwest . 
  fierce fighting took place at r\u00e2mnicu s\u0103rat between december 22 -- 26 , with mackensen 's forces entering the town on december 27 . 
  around this time , the russians began sending numerous reinforcements to moldavia to prevent an invasion of southern russia . 
  southern romania , including oltenia , muntenia , dobruja and southern moldavia , was now in the hands of the central powers . 
  while retreating , the romanians burnt stores of grain and destroyed oil wells to prevent them from being used by the germans . 
   the remaining russo-romanian forces in dobruja abandoned m\u0103cin on january 4 and br\u0103ila on january 5 . source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania_during_world_war_i#kingdom_of_romania_enters_the_war.2c_late_august_1916 please do note that constanta , macin and others cities mentioned are not in southern dobdrudja , but in the northern ( romanian ) one . 
  so the fights took place in romania , not bulgaria . 
  last mad max movie was terrible . 
  big disappointment . 
  too good to be true ? 
  how many muslims would adhere to these concepts ? 
   romania right there ... 
  i mean , on the same page lol , 
  romania seems to be the most isolated . 
  anyway this kind of displaying the data is inherently flawed , because the distance between two countries on the map is proportional to the sum of `` unfavorable views '' between the two , but it does n't really show what is that `` sum '' made of '' . 
  two countries might have a score for `` bad view '' of each other , of `` 50 '' so the distance is 100 , while other two might have 100 and 0 and the distance would be the same . 
  i 'd say in the first case the relationship between the two countries would be friendlier , than in the latter . 
  http://i.imgur.com/pkuowo9.png or https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/romanis-historical-distribution.png why do n't italians from rome ( romans ? ), 
  have the same problem ? 
  anyway , r ( r ) omani is a [ misnomer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/misnomer ) because is a wrong name given by others and ( later ) assumed by themselves , without properly representing their origin . 
  gypsy is too a misnomer . 
  the are not from egypt and not from rome or byzantium ... but still they got to be named as such ... 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people#endonyms ) the greek and the ancient romans are to blame for that : '' probably from greek \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 `` roman '' , signifying inhabitants of byzantium , who considered themselves successors of ancient rome '', 
   seriously you never heard of metro newspapers ? 
  that 's a massive press group , i 'm surprised you do n't have it in romania as well . 
  obviously i was joking , ( maybe the / s was too subtle ? ), 
  i realize it 's a newspaper , but since ( afaik ) we do n't have it in romania i ca n't help from thinking of the supermarket chain when i see the word `` metro '' . 
  would a french businessman register the newspaper name auchan in france ? 
   i think `` metro '' it 's already irremediably connected to the en-gross shop meaning - at least in romania ( do n't know about germany , but i would doubt they have it as newspaper too ) . 
  cats = miau dogs = ham ham birds = cip cirip hen = cotcodac rooster = cucurigu !, 
  cows = muu ( pronounced moooo ... ) sheeps = bee or behehe ( or mee or mehehe ) - pronounced with `` e '' like in net ( but longer ) ducks = mac mac ( pronounced with `` a '' as in `` cup '' ) geese = ga ga horse = ihaha donkey = i-ha, 
  til metro has a newspaper . 
  hopefully tesco will follow ? 
   here is mine about colectiv :p ugh ... not personally connected to colectiv in any sort , but i think joking about that would be really gross . 
  i think fire jokes are tabu or bad taste for at least 10 years from now on ... 
  i wonder where that little river flows into , eventually ... danube ? 
  maybe poorest of the rich ( so to speak ) , but still richer than the ( really ) poor :d i always wondered why is n't portugal following the rule ( large colonial empire -  `` rich '' country ) .

   on another note , i noticed i often have these types of conversations with you every now and then . 
  i see you are interested in studying and analyzing how cultures develop just as much as i am . 
   indeed i am , and i enjoy these conversations too . 
  / r/europe is such a fascinating place in this regard . 
   seems to me nationalism killed a part of the original culture . 
  win some , loose some , i guess . 
  cultures change after all . 
  i guess it was similar to the way the turks went from an arabic writing system to a latin one and the central asian republics to a cyrillic one . 
  also , there is some german cultural influence in the north-west ( transylvania ) , the parts that were under the hungarians and later austrian control , and which had ethnic germans since the middle ages . 
  but the french influence was way stronger . 
  they were our \u201e older brothers '' and our gateway towards renewed \u201e latin-ness '' . 
  but they did conquer most of britain , and from what i hear , the weather is equally rainy there, 
   they didn ; t colonise us at all really i know   there 's a little bit of roman stuff here which i 'm guessing arrived there through trade , right ? 
  i 's your freakin fault for not letting the romans colonize you more !, 
  no , we were in the slavic-orthodox cultural sphere , so we used the cyrillic alphabeth . 
  ( just like the catholic priests used to preach in latin in the west , in the romanian church , until the 19th century , the priests used to preach in old church slavonic ) only in the 19th century , when nationalism was in full swing , did we switch to the latin alphabet , as the national narative was strongly based on our roman ancestry , and our differences from our slavic neighbors . 
  therefore , latin leters were seen as \u201e ours '' , in a traditional-historic sense , while \u201e cyrillics '' were seen as imports . 
  there was also an interesting mixed alphabeth , as we made the transition : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_cyrillic_alphabet img : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:alfbtranzitie.jpeg, 
  context : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lord%27s_prayer#use_as_a_language_comparison_tool  in the course of christianization , one of the first texts to be translated between many languages has historically been the lord 's prayer , long before the full bible would be translated into the respective languages . 
  since the 16th century , collections of translations of the prayer have often been used for a quick comparison of languages about the book in which the map appeared : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/synopsis_universae_philologiae the 4 maps of the book together : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/hensel_1741_4maps.jpg ps : romanian is not featured on the map :( for the curious , this is sort of what it would have looked like : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/romanian_cyrillic_-_lord%27s_prayer_text.svg/1000px-romanian_cyrillic_-_lord%27s_prayer_text.svg.png  1850s romanian text ( lord 's prayer ) , written with the cyrillic script,

  also , do n't forget the former communist countries .

  2 different days : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ve_day http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_day, 
  talk to * [ mykeana ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/teel6/happy_europe_day_reddit/c4lxa00 ) *, 
  oh , brits and their bets ... , 
  let me guess . 
  it 's derived from the french system ? 
   all of them with the exception of one use a legal system derived from anglo-welsh law which one is the exception ? 
    maybe you 'll do better this year , but untill then , puerto rico will continue to be american , just like scotland will continue to be british . '', 
   stop trying to backpedal . 
  plural * you * . 
  as in you puertoricans . 
  * vos * , not * tu * . 
  but maybe you know better than me what i meant to say . 
   you 're the kind of guy who tells black people that if someone calls them the n-word , they should n't be upset and should understand where the other person is coming from . 
  i was wondering when you 'd go from \u201e ethnocentrist '' to \u201e racist '' . 
   i 'm informing you , since you agreed with that train of thought . 
  i did not . 
   what we are legally is meaningless . 
  to you maybe . 
   politically , we do n't have a republican party , so politically using the republican party as an example is stupid . 
  i meant politically in the sense that pr is part or the us , not that it has the same political system . 
   after i pointed out the cultural implications which were offtopic since i asked a non-cultural question . 
  read the conversation again . 
   oh , and as an fyi , i am not using the `` appeal to consequences '' . 
  i am not arguing that since i 'm offended , i 'm not an american citizen . 
  you are . 
  you 're arguing that since you and most puertoricans are offended , the word \u201e american '' does not apply to you guys , under any circumstance . 
  which is false . 
   you did n't mean just an american citizen says the omniscient redditor ... also , i never said you yourself were for independence , btw . 
  please , read the thread again . 
  next time somebody says something you do not like , take the time to calmly explain what you do n't like and take the effort to see where the other one is coming from before you put on your arrogant tone and start calling people ignorant . 
  calling the other person ethnocentric ( ? ), 
  just because you ca n't handle words is quite lame , and might work in real life , but nobody on the internet cares what you are offended about . 
  as a romanian , i can relate to this feeling . 
   and i 've informed you we have no republican party maybe you should inform the one who brought up the republican party . 
   so what is your argument ? 
  what happened is that somebody mentioned the gop , you asked why , and i gave a suggestion that it might be because you are puertorican , and by extension , an american citizen ( not realizing that ) . 
  that is when you started getting all offended and saying that you are not \u201e culturally american '' as if culture was the thing being discussed . 
  it 's not my problem that you ca n't get passed your emotions and realize that american is a polysemic word , and that some meanings apply to puertoricans , whether they like it or not . 
  you are americans geographycally , and ( untill independence ) americans politically . 
  you are not americans culturally or nationally , and i have never argued this . 
  and since you 've discovered logic , i 'm sorry to inform you that i have not been using equivocation , as i have been talking about \u201e american '' as citizenship ( point * b. 
  * from above ) since day one . 
  there is no equivocation here . 
  on the other hand , you 've been bringing up being offended as if that 's an argument . 
  it 's an appeal to consequences , and that 's why i 've been ignoring it . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_ethnicity i guess . 
  i feel it may be synonimous to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gringo in this case, 
   you 're attempting to make a semantic point that does n't serve your argument at all . 
  it does . 
  you 're just too busy being offended to see my argument . 
   why are you so set on calling me `` american '' i 'm not . 
  i 'm set on making you understand , that even if it offends you , or it 's rarely used as such , the word \u201e american '' is applicable to puertoricans in certain ways , as the word \u201e american '' may refer to : a ) a person from the americas b ) a citizen of the united states c ) a native-american d ) a person of american ethnicity, 
   the republican party was brought up because any topic can and will be twisted into something about america . 
  no more , no less . 
  this is not r/worldnews . 
  most people here are europeans . 
   can those romanian citizens vote for parliament ? 
  choose their own head of state/government ? 
  crucial difference . 
  you seem to be missing the point . 
  a century or so ago , the romanians in hungary could not elect their head of state/government . 
  yet they were considered hungarians , as in \u201e hungarian '' citizens/subjects ( whether they liked it or not . 
  hint : they did n't ) . 
   the republic party was brought up to me as if it meant anything , to better explain some insane notion that republicans are like nazis . 
  except it fails as a comparison because , unless we 're talking about the partido popular , partido independentista or partido nuevo progresista , it makes about as much sense as using french parties to explain to you something . 
  i know . 
  but here 's the thing : i did n't bring up the republican party . 
  i just gave you an explanation why the republican party was brought up . 
  do you really think most of the world knows that puerto rico has different parties than the us proper ? 
  you say that :  citizenship and sovereignty are legal terms , and had no bearing on how this discussion ever came about . 
  americans are foreign to us , just like the french and the germans are . 
  but it does . 
  because you ar not a german or a french colony . 
  people see you as somehow part of the us , and say \u201e americans '' , same as for the \u201e american virgin islanders '' or whatever . 
   except it fails as a comparison because no analogy is perfect .

  genetically they are descended of the peoples before them . 
  they were assimilated culturally , but genetically the change was insignificant . 
  all this is irrelevant though . 
  they should call themselves whatever the fuck they want . 
  you do n't see the citizens of rome getting all bitchy about romanians calling themselves that . 
  or germans getting angry that the french use the name of a germanic people . 
  well , henri coanda 's momma was romanian too , so he is tecnichally corect :p, 
   the people that got out of the country and invaded europe are mostly not romanians . 
  most of them are romanian citizens though  they have been put there ( gypsies ) by fucking hitler himself . 
  so , let 's blame germany for the gypsies in romania . 
  wait , what ? 
   the romanian people suffered for 500 years at the hands of the turks so you can prosper in peace , in the west . 
  do n't forget that . 
  every country from viena to the caucasus thinks this about themselves . 
  did you know that the main invasion route from tukey to western europe was not through romania but through what is today the \u201e former yugoslavia '' ? 
   and do n't you dare forget , that even though there was a french empire , a habsburg empire and all that , none of them even gave a hand to helping romania keeping the turks out of europe . 
  yeah , it was the romanians who defeated turkey at the gates of vienna . 
  yep ... 
  reminds me of when i was a child , and cable tv was something new , and the hottest women were the ones on italian tv . 
  the part of romania that borders the republic of moldova is called moldova, 
   udmr ( the party of the hungarian community ) being in the governing coalitions for 20 straight years . 
  actually , 16 years . 
  before that we had [ the \u201e red quadrilateral '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_quadrilateral ) , which included 2 ultranationalist parties ( punr & prm ) . 
  also , they were n't officially * in coalition * during the n\u0103stase premiership ( 200-2004 ) but they did support it \u201e unoficially '' , 
   there are 7 continents [ highly debatable ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continent#number_of_continents ), 
  cyprus on the other hand is 100 % in asia, 
  yep . 
  europe should annex the whole world ... again !, 
   being called `` former soviet republic of '' \u201e yugoslav '' is not a communist moniker, 
  don ' y worry . 
  cypus is in asia, 
   we are joining next year ( croatia ) and i do n't think we are fully ready . 
  do n't worry , we were ' t ready either . 
  cheers romania & bulgaria, 
   \u201e greece ? 
  albania ! '' lol  ) . 
  this must piss off a few greeks . 
  maybe not as much as \u201e greece ? 
  macedonia ! '' would have ... 
  i 'm genuinely impressed by all the compromise i 've seen lately between serbia and kosovo, 
   is drinking coffee popular in romania ? 
  i would guess it is . 
  i personally do n't drink that much coffee , but yeah . 
   people would just pour boiling water on coffee grounds and call it coffee here too . 
  also , in the southern parts , there is a tradition of making [ turkish coffee ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_coffee#romania ) i have no idea if the pisswasser you find in village bistros qualifies as \u201e proper esspresso '' , but urban establishments do have then . 
  i know and agree with what you 've said , but you ca n't really be surprised that the \u201e hungarian = asian '' stereotype pops up , given the somewhat foreign nature of the hungarian language , and the history of the honfoglal\u00e1s , about which other europeans know only that \u201e hungarians came from the east/from asia , and settled here '' . 
  people do n't know all the detail , and you 'll be lucky if they do n't equate huns with hungarians . 
  also , go on any article in the romanian press that deals with the hungarian minority ( especially in a political context ) an you 'll most likely find one idiotic comment on the lines of \u201e go back to asia '' . 
  about anything from 0,7 $ ( village bistro ) to 1.2 - 1.5 $ ( average city , normal range ) to 2 $ ( bucharest fancy-place ), 
   romanians are ... smart googlebomb campaign was successful http://www.romaniansaresmart.com/, 
   hungarians are ... asian . 
  excelent idea !, 
  historical grudges are a shitty reason in my opinion . 
  the present should dictate why russian should or should not become second language . 
  actually europe stops on the caucasus mountain range ( [ see map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/europe_asia_transcontinental.png ) ) . 
  so everything to the south is in asia , and is called transcaucasia ( basically gorgia azerbaidjan and armenia ) . 
  on the other hand , the areas to the north , called ciscaucasia , are in europe geographically , and consequently , all the non-indo-european languages there are in europe . 
  look at [ this map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/ethnic_groups_in_caucasus_region_2009.jpg ) . 
  everything that is inside russia is on european soil . 
  chechens , ingush , all the dagestani peoples , the circassians , as well as turkic peoples suck as the nogay , balkar , kabardin and the mongolic kalmyks further north, 
   above the `` weisswurst\u00e4quator '' this needs an explanation, 
   korttelikapakan for instance looks very similar to k\u00f6rtep\u00e1linka ( plum brandy ) . 
  first thing on my mind too  ), 
  i think this might help the conversation : [ map of german dialects , 1894 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/brockhaus_1894_deutsche_mundarten.jpg ) also , apparently , the [ german standard language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_language#origins ) is based on the southern , [ high german ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high_german ) , dialects, 
   to me it seems like the czech are speaking in diminitives , which is very sweet . 
  i 've heard this before , 
  a [ dialect continuum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dialect_continuum#south_slavic_continuum ) , as they say, 
  \u201e a language is a dialect with an army and a navy '' , as they say  ps . 
  interesting post, 
  same here . 
  i understand italian quite well ( italian tv was easy to decipher as a kid ) . 
  also spanish a bit . 
  and french and portuguese , more the written version than the spoken one , but i learnt french in school . 
  or turkish and azeri . 
  or many other non-indo-european languages from the european part of russia ( especially the caucasus ), 
  i really have no idea . 
  we have one nuclear power plant , with 2 out of 5 reactors finished : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cernavod%c4%83_nuclear_power_plant, 
  i see . 
  thank you . 
  what ? 
   i 'm guessing the romanian hungarian party is just as shitty as the serbian hungarian party , which supported the milosevic government . 
  the rmdsz hungarian party here would never have supported [ prm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_romania_party ) . 
  they were ( and are ) sworn enemies . 
  but the party does have its fare share of corrupt folk . 
  verestoy attila is the most notorious for his business involving timber ( from the forests of the szekler land )  you know , maybe the romanian romanian parties should fix the situation on their own , without pressure from the minorities . 
  the romanian romanian parties do not have platforms for the hungarian constituency . 
  even in areas where hungarians form the majority , the ro-ro parties represent the romanians . 
  i guess the unwritten consensus is that hungarians are the rmdsz 's constituency . 
  plus the fact that addressing hungarian issues by a ro ro party is risky politically . 
  they would probably lose votes in the non-transylvanian areas of romania . 
  also , the rmdsz is the more moderate of the 3 hungarian parties ( and the oldest and the only one to have mps ) . 
  the others are the [ hungarian civic party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_civic_party_\\ ( romania \\ ) ) and [ l\u00e1szl\u00f3 t\u0151k\u00e9s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laszlo_tokes ) 's people 's hungarian transylvanian party ( or something along those lines , a rather new party ) . 
  i would personally like to see something more inclusive along the lines of the [ most - hid party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/most%e2%80%93h%c3%add ) from slovakia . 
   asia-pacific & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  romanian ... forever alone ( yeah , yeah , i know romanian is different because of the slavic influence ), 
   together with a plan to teach more subjects in lithuanian ( especially history of lithuania ) i really do n't understand why people are obsessed with teaching the \u201e national history '' in the majority language . 
  lithuanian history does n't change if it 's taught in a different language . 
   even if you solve this one , they will pick something else and try to make everyone ( poland and eu ) think polish people in lithuania is somehow an abused minority . 
  i 'm sorry , but that 's how minority parties work . 
  and it 's ok , and nothing bad happens .

  totally fair not fair enough . 
  what fair ? 
  could never afford the what ? 
  although , i 'm pretty sure there was a statement from 2012 about the election fraud in 2012 , i could only find a link from 2004 : http://www.bbc.co.uk/romanian/news/story/2004/11/041129_pro_democratia.shtml  according to pro democratia , election fraud is somewhere between 2 and 5 percent , so the results of the election , as we can tell so far , can be influenced by the fraud level . 
  ngos say it 's around 2-5 % . 
  in the 2014 presidential election , there was a huge scandal because people abroad were forced to wait in long lines at embassies ( most notably in london and germany ) in order to cast their votes . 
  ponta ( who was also a candidate ) was head of the government , was n't very popular abroad so he knew people from abroad would vote massively for johannis . 
  trust system for voting ? 
  how come you do n't have massive election fraud ? 
  say you register for voting . 
  what stops someone coming , offering # 100 to let them vote in your name ? 
  they do n't ask for id , so how do they know it 's really you ? 
  we also have that issue . 
  we use what are called supplementary lists , so if you are in a different place , you go to the polling station and they write your personal data and you can vote . 
  this did cause some problems in the past , when people were being bussed around different cities to cast multiple votes , but it 's a pretty serious offense and the prison sentence is quite lengthy . 
  this year , as i understand , they will be using an electronic system so you can instantly be found out if you already voted . 
  why do you have to register in order to vote in the uk ? 
  in romania , each polling station has a list with all eligible voters who reside in the precinct , so on the voting day you just go there , give them your id card , sign next to your name , vote and leave . 
  automation will be a very hard pill to swallow in the beginning , but it will eventually get better . 
  there is already a precedent : industrialization . 
  in the beginning , it was disastrous , people with small manufacturing shops went bankrupt the conditions for workers in factories were terrible , but in the end it got better and better . 
  the 8-hour workday was introduced in addition to other new rights , pension , unemployment benefits etc. 
  its unrealistic to think that because of automation millions of people will suddenly become poor , after all , if people are poor , they do n't have money to consume all the stuff that 's being produced . 
  bucharest average is around $ 8/m ^ 2 , in other romanian cities it 's more like $ 5 . 
  sounds like a plan !, 
  if all of romania came to sweden we 'd outnumber you more than two to one . 
  is it like one of those places where you get stabbed for looking at somebody the wrong way ? 
  if you gib us your monies , we will recognize gotland as rightful danish clay . 
  until then , we consider it part of sweden . 
   we 'll forever be behind others , never to exceed them , because we do n't own any of the big players or equivalents to compete on the global market . 
  i could n't care less about who owns the big businesses , unless it 's myself or the state . 
  london is full of billionaires , how much does that benefit the average londer ? 
  not a whole bunch !, 
  yes , they might earn more money working there than in other parts , but they still ca n't afford much - many live in shared houses ( and it 's not just immigrants ) , everything is crazy expensive and life there is stressful and shitty in general . 
  it does n't matter how many billionaires your country has , all it matters is if whether you are one of them or not . 
  like [ these guys ?

  silly swede . 
  if russia annexes romania , we will come to sweden and steal both your planes and sell them at the junkyard for profit !, 
  yeah , but living in the suburbs is not ideal either . 
  in london , public transport is decent and extensive , but it still takes a lot to move around . 
  if your daily commute is 2 hours , you are losing 4 hours of your life every day that no one 's paying you for . 
  imho , london is a great city to visit , but a complete nightmare to live/work in , unless you 're a billionaire . 
  what if they annex gotland instead ? 
  what do you mean ? 
   they have but it 's not recognized by nobody except by the ruskies . 
  it 's not recognized by the russians either . 
  never heard about that , source ? 
  please , read some real history , not russian distorted one . 
   ** moldavian identity in medieval chronicles **  the chronicles of medieval moldavia attested the names used by the inhabitants of moldavia to refer to themselves as well as the common language and origin of moldavians , wallachians and transylvanians . 
  the first important chronicler of moldavia , grigore ureche ( 1590 -- 1647 ) , states that the romanians of the hungarian kingdom and moldavians have the same origin , since both `` come from rome '' . 
  the same author refers to the language of his work as `` our moldavian language '' . 
  later , chronicler miron costin ( 1633 -- 1691 ) wrote in his on the moldavian nation that the `` oldest and more righteous '' name of the people inhabiting moldavia , wallachia and transylvania is rum\u00e2n ( romanian ) , `` that is roman '' , and that this name was kept from emperor trajan 's colonizations till to that day , albeit more commonly among the wallachians and transylvanians . 
  he also mentioned that , while the people of moldavia identify as `` moldavian '' , they call their language `` romanian '' . 
  his son , chronicler nicolae costin ( 1660 -- 1712 ) , expressed similar opinions . 
  the wallachian chronicler constantin cantacuzino ( 1655 -- 1716 ) explains that by romanians he means romanians from wallachia , transylvania , and moldavia , as they all speak essentially the same language and have a common origin . 
  nevertheless he also states that , unlike the wallachians and transylvanians , which identify as `` romanians '' , the population of moldavia identifies as `` moldavian '' . 
  dimitrie cantemir ( 1673 -- 1723 ) , prince of moldavia and member of the royal academy of berlin , wrote a history book called hronicul vechimei a romano-moldo-vlahilor ( chronicle of the ancientness of the romanian-moldavian-vlachs ) . 
  in the introductory part , he calls it `` a chronicle of the entire romanian land '' ( hronicon a toat\u0103 \u021aara rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 ) that `` later was divided into moldavia , wallachia and transylvania '' ( care apoi s-au \u00eemp\u0103r\u021bit \u00een moldova , munteneasc\u0103 \u0219i ardealul ) and mentions that the book was first written in latin and then translated into romanian ( pre limba rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 ) . 
  while attesting that the people of moldavia call themselves `` moldavians '' , he also states that `` romanian '' is to be used when referring commonly to transylvanians , moldavians and wallachians ( carii cu to\u021bii cu un nume de ob\u0219te rom\u00e2ni s\u0103 chiam\u0103 ) . 
   ** selected foreign travelers about moldavians **  several foreign travelers through moldavia since the 16th century noted that locals called themselves `` romanians '' and their language `` romanian '' . 
  they also mention the awareness of a common roman origin among the inhabitants of moldavia and neighbouring wallachia and transylvania . 
  georg reicherstorffer ( 1495 -- 1554 ) , a transylvanian saxon , was the emissary of ferdinand i of habsburg in wallachia and moldavia . 
  describing the geography of moldavia he finds that `` besides this name it is also called wallachia '' and then speaking about the moldavian people he says that `` the roman * italian * language still endures in this nation ... so the wallachians [ from moldavia ] are an italian nation , as they claim , from the old romans '' . 
  a chronicler and mercenary from verona , alessandro guagnini ( 1538 -- 1614 ) , traveled twice in moldavia and helped despot vod\u0103 ( ioan iacob heraclid ) gain the throne in 1563 . 
  in his biography of the prince , `` vita despothi principis moldaviae '' , he described to the people of moldavia : `` this nation of wallachians refer to themselves as romana and say that they originate from exiled romans of italy . 
  their language is a mixture of latin and italian languages , so that an italian can easily understand a wallachian '' . 
  after a visit to moldavia an anonymous traveler , probably an italian jesuit , wrote in 1587 a description of the people and found that `` these people * moldavians * belong to the greek faith , they take kindly to everything that is roman , maybe because of their corrupted language from latin , or for the belief they have about their descent from the romans , as they call themselves romans '' . 
  also , according to these sources , the slav neighbours called moldovans `` vlachs '' or `` volokhs '' , a term equally used to refer to all the romance speakers from wallachia , transylvania , and the balkan peninsula . 
  nicolaus olahus ( 1493 -- 1568 ) , proeminent humanist , writes in hungaria et attila that the moldavians have the same language , rituals and religion as the wallachians and that the only way to distinguish them is by their clothes . 
  he also mentions that the language of moldavians and other vlach peoples was once roman ( latin ) , as they all were colonies of the roman empire . 
   thomas thornton ( 1762 -- 1814 ) wrote a book in 1807 about his numerous travels inside the ottoman empire and says that the wallachian and moldavian peasants call themselves `` rumun , or roman '' , to distinguish themselves from boyars ( local nobles ) , and that their language is a corrupt latin . 
  i 'm obviously not going to vote , but i can still have an opinion , ca n't i ? 
  no , but i lived and worked there for almost 3 years , does it count ? 
  depends on how much you 're offering . 
  remain 2 . 
  europe is important for the future of britain and britain is important for the future of europe . 
  i agree the eu has serious problems and that it needs reforms , but countries picking up their toys and leaving is not a solution , at least not a good one for anyone ( except russia , of course ) . 
  i think it 's going to be a close call , but probably remain will win . 
  he 's the kind of guy that appeals to the emotional side of people , very charismatic , a very good speaker , but when you look beyond the facade , his arguments simply do n't stand up . 
  let 's not forget when he was ranting about how romanian and bulgarians were going to come in doves after 2014 , an apocalypse that has n't really materialized . 
  sure , immigration of romanians and bulgarians has gone up , but not at the scale that he was predicting and they are going there because there is demand for them on the job market . 
  also , many people are coming back from the uk , a flight from london to bucharest or timisoara is only around # 50-60 . 
  i also think the ukip would be dead without nigel . 
  we can steal your monies and then use them to pay you for it . 
  deal ? 
  kovesi was appointed by ponta in 2013 , at the time the romanian government was desperately trying to join schengen , so they needed someone who would make them look good in the eu . 
  i 'm pretty sure he underestimated her , he likely did n't think it would come back to haunt him and his family . 
  she was just given another 3 year term last month and ca n't be replaced until her term expires so the fight against corruption is due continue until at least 2019 . 
  it was common in rural romania until a few years ago , now it 's very rare . 
  in moldova it 's still a thing , even in cities . 
  they are not much more aware of the outside world than the average russian is . 
  while they do have internet access , most of the information about the outside world still comes from russian media outlets . 
  the only ones who have a reasonable picture are the ones who can actually speak romanian/english/french / german and read news from these countries . 
   they are zero romanians here , only moldovans ( these are very different people esp moldovans living in transnistria ) , that 's a lie . 
  my ex-gf is from bender , her family always considered themselves romanian and she studied at a romanian school . 
  there are very few romanian schools in transnistria , but that 's because your fascist government is doing all it can to shut them down , threaten students and teachers etc. 
  because they want to push the so-called `` moldovan language '' with cyrillic letters . 
  i agree that most moldovans in transnistria are almost completely russified , but saying there are no romanians is just not true .

  the uk did n't want them two centuries ago , but we 'll gladly welcome them back !, 
  kind of ironic considering the current british politics . 
  more like the uk , czech republic , etc.

  mate ... did you drink a little too much ? 
  i hear danes really like their alcohol ... 
  this is from 2011 , so a lot of opinions , especially concerning immigration should 've changed . 
  also what 's the point of having maps with no data ? 
  you 're comparing britain then and now . 
  it had [ around 15 million people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demography_of_the_united_kingdom#history ) back then , so it was easier to feed all of them . 
  not to mention it was the first country to reap the benefits of the industrial revolution . 
  it was also an empire with lots of accumulated wealth from the places they ruled . 
  and most importantly , back then war was a viable solution to resolve any issue , not so much today . 
  so then what leverage * does * the uk have over eu ? 
  just honestly curious . 
  it ca n't be * that * one-sided , otherwise negotiations would n't be such a stalemate . 
  they might 've been drunk , jus ' sayin ' . 
  that 's the same mentality we had a century ago . 
  they are the barbarians and we must civilize them , continue the legacy that the romans left us , etc. 
  cue the white man 's burden by rudyard kipling , cue colonialism and so on . 
  all in the name of realpolitik , where pragmatism drives the actions of the country . 
  i agree with idea , but like i said i do not find it realistic , for reasons already stated . 
  it 's very hard to put it into reality and would most likely require more serious events to take place for people to consider it as a viable solution among the stuff that * works * , as in not ideologically or morally motivated but purely pragmatic , foremost in the interest of the state and then the rest . 
  even so , maybe realpolitik is n't what europe needs or wants . 
   what we * should * do is offer our services for government management . 
  neo-colonialism if you will . 
  take a country which sucks and where people are miserable . 
  and offer to the people , if they want , we 'll be willing to come in and take over their government , and actually set things right . 
  if they do n't want us to take over their country , that 's fine , that 's their decision , but they ca n't come here either . 
  the proposal sounds good in theory , but that 's a pretty big should . 
  it fails to take into account the conflict of interest that might arise when contemporaries rediscover what it 's like to have power over a poor , rather uneducated and populous country that is also quite rich in resources . 
  the cooperation required would be mind-blowing and if you ca n't convince citizens today to let a few european immigrants from poorer countries in the east then there 's no realistic way you could convince them to invest vast amounts of money and time in a 3rd world country the average citizen ca n't even find on the map . 
  then it 's op 's fault for ambiguity . 
  i assume most people think of * growth rate * when * growth * of something is mentioned . 
  absolute statistics need to be adjusted for context , or else they will be misinterpreted , intentionally or accidentally . 
  he also conveniently forgot to mention that the growth rate is decreasing , which is required for context and consequently makes it even more misleading . 
  fair enough . 
  i presume they would probably find some justification to propose such ideas anyway , but without religion and its popularity they would not threaten the average citizen who is just minding his own life . 
   compared to our moderate religions ... adapt to their standards or threaten the lives of the people [ umm ... 
  i mean it 's good news , but still ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/55ziyo/polish_government_signals_uturn_on_total_abortion/ ) the us also has the bible belt and many downright atrocious fundamentalists that challenge the `` pagans '' , especially their muslim counterparts . . 
  the average person does n't care , and typically is caught in the middle . 
  the current pope is better but still not good . 
  you probably know about some of the controversial and downright ludicrous stuff he said since his investment . 
  the patriarchy in moscow in comparison is just sad . 
  do n't forget the romanians !, 
   he explicitly stressed that he thinks things could boil over long before muslims would become a majority in europe muslims , the problem is in the name itself . 
  i do n't care about their skin , or education , or anything else related to culture . 
  their religion however , is downright atrocious and belongs in the dark ages . 
  the catholic church grew a brain while the orthodox church was tamed by secularism and later communism , although there are still quite a few religious issues . 
  islam will most likely suffer a major reformation in the following decades , and there will be blood . 
  i feel that it 's our duty to , at the very least , make sure not too much european blood will be lost , including naturalized muslims who came here decades ago .

  we are also a very religious country , more than poland in fact but orthodox instead .

  people have many reasons to hate each other , and it 's unpredictable even what future ways they will concoct to justify bigotry . 
  true , but it 's just more efficient to have a single sovereign state , as i said in my first response . 
  it may not have many resources , but it can become a trading power like venice did , if it 's a city state for example . 
  we do n't break up countries into smaller states , mainly because we do n't need to ( that 's the whole point of administrative divisions ) . 
  politics , history , economy , nationalism , ethnolinguistics , etc are what keep a nation united . 
  depending on the situation , sovereign states may break up or unite , for a wide variety of reasons . 
  even if hypothetically we could break up every country in the world into millions of city states and small states , we would have to deal with the huge backtrack in human development set by this precedent . 
  eventually most places would start reuniting to be stronger together , and we would n't end up anywhere . 
  ah , my bad . 
  we do n't need too . 
  that 's why we have local administrators and systems of dividing them by counties . 
  countries can be a federation for example , where the states that make the country are mostly self-governing . 
  because it 's easier to manage a smaller country ?

  look at the country .

  oh , wait , that 's a correct question to ask , not just ~ ~ circus ~ ~ handcuffs on camera pretending to do justice ... 
  you 'll see upholding & cheers to that one , but this one , whaddya see , everybody is against it . 
  and the big brother one went just as a banal afternoon . 
  double standards , both . 
  give me a break , `` censorship '' ?!? 
  if you 're accused out of the random ( no evidence , no proof , no correlation , no nothing , just outright character assassination just because someone thinks another person is guilty of ... ` `` something '' ` ... they do n't know , but they 're sure it 's ... ` `` something '' ` ) , to be an outlaw , you 've immediately lost a lot of credibility without second thoughts from others . 
  you might as well be a puritan : the moment some smuck from the internet * or * with a microphone under the nose & a pointed camera * or * with a `` yours truly ... '' piece of paper * or * written allegation ( circus with handcuffs , starring the dna , he-hey ) , you 're burned without chance of recovery . 
  after all of that , even after you 've proven yourself innocent ( that 's right , in romania , you have to prove yourself innocent ) nothing would pardon you from the public eye , you 're already `` dirty '' no matter what , puritan or not , guilty ... * or not * . 
  ffs , a lot do n't know the difference between indictment & conviction . 
  they think it 's the same thing !, 
  and if anyone , truly , has a problem with freedom of speech , to such idiocy calling this ^ law appealing to censorship , then it 's [ double standards ] ( http://www.gandul.info/politica/cum-a-ajuns-politia-internetului-in-legea-antilegionara-a-liberalilor-antonescu-si-scutaru-in-general-lumea-crede-ca-poate-face-orice-pe-facebook-14665241 ) seen clear from the moon . 
  and [ this one ] ( http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/legea-big-brother-promulgata-de-presedinte-14817477 ) , just to add some icing . 
  self-loathe mixed with xenophilia . 
   and i can relate to your mentality . 
    * '' ~ ~ love my country but ~ ~ if shit hits the fan i 'll be packing up and ensuring safety for my family . 
  '' * fixed that only for you . 
  are you even patriotic or just another xenophile ? 
  because you ca n't be patriotic and a xenophile at the same time . 
  ... while undermining & destroying the domestic/autochtonous capital in the name of xenophilia because , right , all foreigners are innocent , while all romanians are corrupt . 
  forgot that part , op u/smenaru . 
  like a humble xenophiliac . 
  yeah , i mean , that jesus of nazareth guy ... phew , attacking roman values & traditions , imposing himself as the messiah , defying yahweh and his laws , as well . 
  how about that other guy , napoleon : a real terrorist & leader of the french , worse than our isis & al-baghdadi nowadays . 
  and a loooooot of terrorists in december 1989 ... a lot , a lot , of terrorists attacking the state 's interests . 
  tsk , tsk , tsk ... 
  honestly , there 's nothing to * not * hate vegetarians and cyclists . 
   it also about how it was done ( over night vote which ignoring any discussion and other standard practices ) you expect niceties with the head ( s ) of the national mass-media that were put by the previous government , your opposition ? 
  no offense but in politics , any thing that has to do with public media , is to be turned into your own hub , otherwise , expect criticism and propaganda from your opponents ' frontmen . 
  this is n't strictly about freedom of speech : it 's politics of play or be played . 
   ( publicly threatening individual journalists with firing , bashing them for any criticism toward government , threatening private media with legal actions , saying shit like `` current media declared war on poland '' etc. ), 
  obviously , that is bad which does n't have nothing to do with the public media or free speech . 
   of course they replaced most of top management but they did over time in civilized fashion , overglorifying pettiness . 
   allowing journalists associated with opposition to continue their work . 
   * no offense but in politics , any thing that has to do with public media , is to be turned into your own hub , otherwise , expect criticism and propaganda from your opponents ' frontmen . 
  * like war , it 's all about which side you reside with . 
  he knows the theft of resources is what made the www countries wealthy , it 's a no-brainer by default when discussing economics on this topic . 
  on his twitter , he persists that `` good governance '' ( ?!? ), 
  will solve their economic problems . 
  yeah , yeah try fixing an economy by * not * letting it develop ways of creating autochthonous capital & enterprise , let it all loose to foreign enterprises to gauch it all up , competition being optional too . 
  the rest are politics & treaties , the * bonus * link explains it all . 
  * just as a sidenote , * these problems are the same reasons why [ parts of central and all of eastern europe have trust issues ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3wdt5j/the_hypocrisy_of_eastern_europe/ ) ( sole exception being xenophiles ) .

  details ? 
  what about iranians ? 
  what 's the name for rome there ? 
  the capital do poles see it as capital of gypsies ? 
  mmmm . . food . 
  we 've had ` how do you view country x ' and iirc some replies were from americans, 
  i do n't think there are any important ties between the 2 of you so you 're not picked for the study, 
  russians are alergic to nato, 
  polls like this are done on just a few countries it 's difficult to ask about all so they pick some relevant ones plus a few random, 
  well itar is state media, 
  did n't it start with hungary ? 
  kinda, 
  just concerned tourists, 
   putin incorrectly think the eu and us are weak maybe it is . 
  he is working on it anyway . 
  keep an eye on his friends in europe . 
  all he needs is to get more of them in power . 
  expect russia to grow a lot bolder after le pen wins in france . 
  was n't obama just visiting there yesterday ? 
  this is russia taunting . 
  it 's like : `` oh , obama coming there ?? 
  i 'm not afraid !!!, 
  look at this ! '', 
  azerbaidjan too ? 
  maybe if it was with a ` t ' fran ** \u021b ** a it 's like frantza, 
   if you guys want , it could eventually include non-european countries . 
  but most of those integrate so well they lose their ` gypsiness ', 
  yeah imagine dealing with a cop like that, 
  ours, 
   so , i would n't blame eastern orthodox church for all east europe problems . 
  in my opinion , romania , ukraine , russia , bulgaria and yugoslavia ( and later serbia ) have many ethnicities/cultures by country , that causes tensions and have configured the turbulent history of this part of europe . 
  it goes hand in hand with geography because lots of people came through here ( celts , goths , huns , cumans , turks , slavs , romans etc ) and some settled  existence of natural resources . 
  it seems like it 's usually a bad thing, 
  or maybe on one of the social sciences subs, 
  you sure ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_betrayal btw i 've read somewhere that the king here offered support but you declined and wanted france and uk to help instead . 
  that worked well . 
  changed your minds after that though / i mean after that you got the president , government , people in general , that bank gold out through here nazies complained much, 
  damn the czech dont like us either :\\ i do n't understand some of those names, 
  i want to see poll results done for turkey everybody actually, 
  it 's because russia is n't popular either and you were very close with them and alike for so long, 
   we are literally worse than ~ ~ hitler ~ ~ stalin . 
  historically ours are good with poles too most of them and us probably have no clue though, 
   and as far as i know the romania is believed ( i do n't know if it still true ) to be one of the biggest sources of human trafficing . 
  among eu countries ? 
  probably true generally most of it is from the balkans , excommie zones mainly . 
  ie moldova, 
  are you a fan of petre \u021au\u021bea ? 
  i think it was him or djuvara that talked about this . 
  are there polls like this done in turkey ? 
  yeah it 's got ta be more than that it 's weird because there 's no historical reason :\\ apparently, 
  is russia88 a neonazi name ? 
  lol, 
  orange is good , blue is n't . 
  maybe russia should be the one keeping finland happy . 
  you ca n't join nato without referendum, 
  conditions not right meaning nato summit going on currently, 
  but you see they arent terrorists they are just concerned citizens it is just their civic duty, 
  and morons still complain about nato, 
  it will be ready in 2015 i think, 
  i do n't really believe that . 
  anyway , we here already have 2 bases . 
  i wonder if you guys up north already have some too . 
  solution idea : ban twitter, 
   you ca n't force market like that . 
  not force them . 
  i thought it is common sense already . 
  long term it would be worth it . 
  to me it 's obvious that russia is n't reliable to trade with . 
  it ca n't really be profitable long term . 
   would you just feel safer . 
  that is what it is all about nato just has to ` do something ' for the people , not the governments , to see . 
   ** in case of war ** poland will be a battleground , whether there will be bases here or not , ** you could at least avoid bloodshed ** . 
  wo n't happen anyway, 
  i kinda expected netherlands to be higher, 
  is there work done to look for other markets ? 
  does it really deserve help ? 
  i suspected that there 's something about that but i could n't figure it out, 
  yeah it looks like it 's the best option to give up on it but the problem is that it makes kiev look bad http://pastebin.com/0txykswr if you cant see the article, 
   among most of the population , there is n't even a hint of intolerance between ukrainians and russians . 
  i do n't think it 's like that anymore . 
  just like in communism, 
  there 's no name at all on this site not even in about us and the site just looks amateurish, 
  i wonder what the song from 2:21 to 2:39 is it sounds very familiar :d ah [ cioc\u00e2rlia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5pn1x1_a64 ), 
   / r/conspiracy or or / r/russia the same thing, 
  source ? 
  what a load of bullshit, 
  they just need an enemy this is it, 
  seems like it would be better to just give it up, 
  maybe a few in the balkans that maybe plan to join it anyway like montenegro , bosnia , macedonia, 
  it could use him to promote euroskepticism there, 
  all this threatening from putin makes him look desperate and worried, 
  does this guy have any connection with serge moscovici ? 
  but they do have plenty of the common sense he wants http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-09-01/more-sanctions-europe-will-ban-purchase-russian-bonds-however-russian-gas-exports-re sanctions : russian gas exports remain untouched, 
   i still believe they wo n't ban drugs import . 
  it is just too much , imho ... not if you get the media to tell people it 's the fascist degenerate west 's fault which they will probably buy and then you get more domestic support to go against that  the best solution to the current crisis is regime change in russia . 
  #putinmustgo very unlikely, 
  they officially didnt take it they dont actually recognise it they do with crimea now though, 
  some ideas 1 . reduce the us 's influence ( things that make it look bad like nsa spying on germany helps ) 2 . get western europe to agree or just not get involved ( ie germany not agreeing with having nato bases in the east is a sign of that ) just build ties with putinists , appeasers , all the useful idiots that see russia as an alternative . 
  3 . get politicians and media on his side .

  so , just like early-20th century falangism , strasserism , and the whole of italian fascism ? 
  this is europe , there is nothing new under the sun on this continent . 
  and the authoritarians picking up syncretic politics could likely be traced back further than the invention of writing . 
  so why is this now news to us ? 
   i 'll be fine with it , if the french army is fine with it . 
  professional armies usually really dislike conscription . 
  competes for funding , turns them into a baby-sitting organization , and gives them truck-loads of unknown quantities to deal with . 
  conscription in peace-time is usually done with socio-economic consideration , at best , and some sort of delusional `` teach them to love their country '' mentality at worst . 
  but it usually gets the job done in giving the state an excuse to pay young people a wage without making it seem like a handout . 
  for some people , it even provides the type of environment they do better in , in comparison with being left to their own devices . 
  this is often overplayed , but not completely untrue , although leads to institutionalization of veterans . 
   but if they think it 's a waste of time , and they feel like they 're just being used by the french government to show the people how tough macron is for the derailed youth , then i 'm not fine with it . 
  it is a professional organisation and environment , it should n't be used for playing games . 
  i do n't agree . 
  even if not the best tool , it 's still a tool . 
  if they model it on the israeli armies flexible service model ( sherut leumi ) , it might even provide larger social benefit . 
  it 's pretty obvious the one month is part of gradual re-institution , if the political capital becomes available to continue on that path . 
  conscription is actually a more complicated process than it seems . 
  not only in terms of housing and feeding , but with finding suitable training personnel that , at the very least , wo n't end up in some sort of abuse case in the future . 
   why punish all french youths when it 's just the immigrants and minorities causing all the recent trouble . 
  do n't care how politically incorrect that is because it 's correct in the true sense of the word . 
  i do n't think you understand any of this , tbh , judging by your knee-jerk reaction . 
  france has a youth unemployment problem . 
  france has a security problem . 
  and france has an assimilation problem . 
  open a history book on france , and how are all of this solved at the same time ? 
  conscription . 
  it 's a mechanism old as the nation of france itself , it practically made france . 
  not even 2 decades have passed since it was suspended . 
  now do the french people want this ? 
  who knows we 'll see . 
  edit : utterly unsurprised at the amount of british over-reaction here . 
  wait till they hear they have id cards in france , and the gendarmerie carries machine guns on patrol . 
   this equalization between ethnicity and state simply does n't work in central-eastern europe . 
  one day we should just have this wake-up call and just accept multilingualism , if not outright pluri-ethnicity , is part of the regional fabric . 
  not to say we should undermine the current nation-states . 
  but perhaps tend to a more french view of things , rather than german . 
  missed opportunity to put him under both and watch the subsequent rabid fighting and breakdowns . 
  as someone who just added two new signatures using a temporary email generator , google maps and a non-uk ip : nothing . 
  you 're right . 
  oops . 
   that 's democracy too . 
  farage and lepen get paid very well for this as well . 
  not actually democracy , but `` rule of law '' or maybe best called `` european legalism '' . 
  there have been democracies where such discrimination was allowed , as well as non-democratic states where such discrimination would n't be allowed . 
  the issue is you do n't need the entire country , you just need to influence a die-hard minority to support you . 
  and for russia that support does n't translate into pro-russian feeling necesarilly . 
  they seem more than happy to enact the diplomatic equivalent of a dos attack . 
  just keep creating conflicts until everyone is too overwhelmed . 
  sure , unless properly fermented and distilled . 
  tito : the first and only yuglosvlav ? 
  if i remember correctly meps have budget funds allocated for `` meeting with constituents '' , allowing them to fly people over and host them . 
  last chance to get over the channel . 
  7 years cut off the average life span says no , no you are n't . 
  but the german nationals get their money back , at the end of the tax year . 
  then there 's the friendly border guards . 
  nothing says `` welcome !, 
  '' , like a man in uniform scowling at you and questioning your motives for being in the country . 
  the issue is because of prior agreements we do n't vote by majority . 
  a lot of really important issues are done by unanimity . 
  or , could be done by majority , but everyone is too scared of amount of anti-eu spite that results from loosing a vote . 
  this combined with our unhealthy focus in the council means we are dysfunctional , nothing ever gets done . 
  disagree , completely . 
  our `` brand '' , our currency , as the eu before 2009 has been that we do n't need to blast media about how good and great it is . 
  even the national customs shied away from flag waving until recently . 
  dumping that for `` radio free europe '' is wasteful . 
  we need it rebuilt . 
  we need to `` just work '' again , without fanfare or non-sense . 
  and with that unassuming exterior , we can then properly supply the right leverage without anyone ever needing to know . 
  but that 's speculation and dreaming honestly . 
  we 've long past the point of competence in our institutions , collective or individual . 
  / r/the _ orangefarce is leaking again . 
   i 'm not saying sanction them because that 's the only thing we can do . 
  no situation is impossible least of all for europe which shares with the us the title of the biggest economy on earth , has half a billion people and some of the brightest minds out there . 
  you can have the finest pile of bricks known to man , but a pile of bricks do n't make a house . 
  all of that is `` paper tiger '' territory , statistics without ultimate meaning . 
  we are disorganized , divided , and unable to leverage any of the advantage we do have . 
  the only thing any of that has brought us , is an unearned sense of superiority and invulnerability . 
   we should be able to figure it out and from then on only our political structure is hurting the implementation . 
  `` the answer is n't more europe '' . 
  we wo n't , we 've got people dedicated to making sure we wo n't . 
  we ca n't argue `` we have to do something , this is something , so we have to do that '' though . 
  we simply do n't have the right tools to deal with turkey , or any resources . 
  we 're bankrupt , spent , and unarmed diplomatically . 
  we need something less than sanctions , but more than just cutting eu ties . 
  we need the sort of subtlety and planning that would allows us to coordinate with turkish opposition parties and remaining political organizations to exert concerted pressure . 
  but it 's impossible . 
  27 uncoordinated foreign policies are running around like clowns , fucking about 90 % of the time between themselves . 
  so no , i suggest we actually built up something we can use , before we start talking about what we 're supposed to do . 
  turkey is one symptom among many . 
  the instabiliy in the west balkans , the issues with ukraine , the governments of hungary and poland , brexit , even the successful geopolitical machinations of russia have one cause . 
  the eu not only does n't have any hard power , but it has lost all soft power . 
  we 're not people who are listened to , who are admired , or who have any say in things . 
  we 're the worlds idiots . 
  we have to fix that , before we start thinking about turkey . 
  while the hungarian government has a lot going against it , this is n't it . 
  ngo 's actually develop shipping container camps as well , because they 're cheap , easy and fast . 
  an ngo actually had problems with the greek government awhile ago because their more cost-effective plan to use containers was abandoned by the government who instead went for a more ambitious plan that failed to get finished in time and in the right numbers , in my opinion out of a desire to cut in a favorite contractor on the building . 
  it 's hard enough keeping the conversation civil and factual , without this sort of red herring . 
   large companies do n't just fold , they have very deep reserves , and even if they do , other companies buy their equipment and customer portfolio , becoming big themselves in the process .

  out of 4 spanish articles i found on this topic , 3 were referring to `` possibly '' foreign customers with possibly `` east european '' accent . 
  apparently [ this ] ( http://www.infobierzo.com/una-familia-contrata-en-un-restaurante-de-bembibre-un-banquete-para-mas-de-100-personas-y-se-marchan-sin-pagar/292699/ ) is the initial article . 
  on the same website there is a newer article describing similar incidents that happened earlier in february . 
  so it 's an organised band of non-paying restaurant diners . 
  this seems funny and a little odd , police not being able to get them . 
  it seems there might be more to it than it was wrote and said . 
  it was n't criticism , just a question about your browser spellchecker . 
  as for your statement , it does n't really make much sense to me . 
  i guess you were referring to bulgaria and whether their citizens or rulers agree with `` what the majority wants '' , but still this does n't make any sense and seems unrelated to the op article . 
  maybe you were replying to a post above , but since you do n't quote , beats me ... bulgaria does not have any optouts ( so what optout should they be happy with ? 
  ) , bulgaria is already an eu member ( so what 's to join here ? ) ... 
  you lost me . 
  what should they agree on/participate , what majority you mean they are happy or not with , ... as i said , i do n't understand what you mean . 
  the time for optouts has passed . 
  they are no longer allowed for newer members . 
  does n't your browser spellchecker hurt because of all those punctuation marks not followed by spaces ? 
  i mean `` well , then '' and `` wants.if '' are not really proper words , are they ? 
  europe is already in two-tier mode : eu and non-eu . 
  i guess ms zlateva meant she was against a two-tier mode planned for eu . 
  but even if talking about eu , i do n't understand why the talk is about/against `` the creation of the so-called core [ ... ] and the rest '' like this would be a thing of the future , when in fact it 's a very present-day matter : the tiers and divisions have been already here , from the beginning or joining . 
  we have the schengen vs non-schengen split ( which should in theory come to an end but actually the non-schengen countries are at the mercy of the schengen ones in this respect , being postponed with or without valid arguments ) , then we have countries with opt-outs and countries without ( this division is apparently not going to disappear , because this is just the way it is ) , then there are further and maybe more important differences that divide eu countries : wealthy vs. poor , former communist vs the others , former colonial empires vs the others and so on . 
  in theory , given enough time , some of them might diminish or even disappear , but it 's not likely this will happen very soon . 
  of course , i understand what ms zlateva means , we do n't want additional divisions , but let 's just not pretend currently all the eu countries are equal in status and rights . 
  no problem , you 're right about the spam situation . 
  that must mean `` the kingdom of oysters '' ( or it 's just a false cognate ), 
  not to be pedantic , but i was posting a link to a news article , the previous post was just a link to a picture edit : or maybe you thought it was just the picture ? 
  wait , is n't this one the original one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe8wzynrpnu, 
  i do n't pretend i 'm smarter than the people in dutch universities , and i 'm not a linguist , but this map seems to be full of mistakes . 
  bulgarian and hungarian pujka/pulyka are wrongly labeled as having onomatopoeic origin . 
  in fact they are derived from the latin pulleus / pullus , similar to `` puica '' in romanian ( meaning female chick/hen ) . 
  this map mixes feminine and masculine version of the word . 
  at least for romanian , where `` curcan '' is the name of the male turkey , while `` curca '' is the feminine version . 
  according to romanian etymological sources , `` curcan '' is actually derived from `` curca '' , which is a loan from bulgarian `` kurka '' ( which might be out of use currently ) , which in turn is a loan from proto-turkic k\u00f6rt\u00fck , the same as the baschkir word [ \u043a\u04af\u0440\u043a\u04d9 ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%d0%ba%d2%af%d1%80%d0%ba%d3%99 ) . 
  i think it 's very likely that all the balkan/central-european words for turkey starting with `` c '' ( curca , kurka , curan , maybe even krokan ) could be derived from the same proto-turkic k\u00f6rt\u00fck . 
  as for the onomatopoeic sound , i am not sure what language do the turkeys speak in other countries but at leas where i am from , they do n't `` say '' truthuhn , but `` glu-glu-glu '' . 
  and by the way , if `` hahn '' means cock ( male of hen ) and trut-huhn ends in `` huhn '' - is n't there a connection ? 
  3 , 2 , 1 , bragging galore !, 
  just kiddin ' , but i hope reddit wo n't turn into facebook ii, 
   private even the hospitals [ edit : public hospitals ] `` externalize '' the clinical laboratory services , to specialized private medical practices or laboratories , that rent a space within the hospital premises . 
  this is the peak of corruption or incompetence . 
  the hospital is unable to manage a clinical lab , so they outsource the lab investigations to a private company . 
  they are either blatantly incompetent and ca n't keep working with profit , or are corrupt ( and the private lab company is most probably appointed despite conflict of interest ) or both . 
  i know pisa is secondary school level ( age 15 ) test , while the imo ( see below ) is high-school level ( under 20 ) and the participation scope is different , but still , it 's interesting how different are the results when comparing the two : https://www.imo-official.org/results_country.aspx?column=awards&amp;order=desc of course , pisa is for the average/all students , while only the best in each country attend the imos . 
  i see sweden , finland , estonia have very good math performance in pisa , but are ranked much lower in the imos and i 'm really wondering why . 
  at first i thought they are not interested in the imo 's and do not attend , but i was wrong : in 2016 sweden got 3 silver and 2 honorable mentions , estonia 1 bronze and 3 hm and finland only 3 hm . 
  meanwhile , in 2016 romania got 5 silver and 1 bronze . 
  to be honest , our education system ( in romania ) is really bad right now , ** overall ** , due to low funding and very low teacher wages . 
  but there might be an additional explanation to this bad performance in pisa : pisa is organised by oecd and some non-oecd contries ( including some in ue ) were rather late to the party and not really used to this kind of tests ( and , i heard , not really fully interested or involved ) . 
  pisa , timss , pirls and other forms of national testing were quite popular in some contries quite earlier , before being introduced in others . 
  i 'm not trying to find excuses ( i already said i 'm dissapointed by the current education system in romania ) but i 'm just noticing a fact . 
  the truth is that we have huge differences , with some very good students ( most of them in urban areas ) and , on the extreme , students in some rural areas with low acces to education . 
  the villages become un-populated , they are mixing ages in order to keep a school going ( e.g. 
  they make a single class for kids 6-7-8 years old and one for 9-10-11 y.o. , because there are not enough people - and kids - in those villages ) , schools are closed and kids must use a school bus or even walk 10 km to the next village ... and so on . 
  in rural areas there is also school abandonment ( even if education is compulsory by law ) . 
  ther 's no easy solution to this . 
  you ca n't force adults to remain in the villages if they get jobs in the cities and whole families leave , but you ca n't `` close '' the villages eihere , because there are still people there - so how can you keep a school with only 10 students ? . 
  you ca n't stop people going for work abroad ( unless you offer jobs here ) and that leaves some villages with a number of unattended kids ( or attended only by grandparents ) who only see their parents once in a year , some of them being forced to abandon school in order to work/care for their younger brothers . 
  while not at a very large scale , these issues exists are are extremely harmful . 
  these inequalities between urban/rural and between high-income and low-income families contribute a lot to the low pisa average score . 
  it 'd be interesting to se a breakout in rural/urban scores . 
  i upvote you for noticing how bad our education has fallen . 
  i 've been complaining about this for quite a few years but nobody seems to care . 
  happy birthday lithuania !, 
  romania has also celebrated 98 years from the `` great union day '' ( on december 1st 1918 ) which is practically our ( re ) birth day , marking the ( re ) unification of transylvania , bessarabia and bukovina with the romanian kingdom ( at that moment including wallachia and moldova ) . 
  the previous union was under michael the brave around 1600 but it did n't last long . 
  just wait , we 'll be right there in no time ; in fact , we 've already started . 
  being located between 3 empires ( habsburg , ottoman and tsarist ) and enduring half a century of communism is nothing we ca n't handle . 
   makes me wonder ... now i 'm genuinely wondering what you 're wondering . 
  ( i 'm guessing here - you suspect a ) a conspiracy involving your government in order not to broadcast this in czech media ... or b ) you wonder if the romanian protests really happen ? ), 
  all right , fair enough . 
  thanks for the reply . 
  what is your view on the double standards that might be applied when assessing what 's local news and on allowing question posts ? 
  some `` local news '' are allowed ( probably when deemed ^ by ^ whom ? 
  `` important enough '' ) , while some of similar scope are removed . 
  sometimes a question is allowed , while others are exiled to askeurope . 
  moderators are only human , so they might be prone to subjective judgement , but what 's allowed or not should n't be decided by personal preference . 
  there are ( or were , i 'm not sure ) mods that are ( or were ) constantly removing news ( news originating usually not from france , uk , or germany ) labelling them `` local news '' , even if they were no more local than others . 
  then there is the seldom question allowed once in a while , even if the rules say `` please use / r/askeurope for simple questions '' . 
  who decides what 's simple and how objective is that ? 
  thank you . 
  we have the best winds in europe . 
  it 's true . 
   it 's its , government 's pro-corruption decisions, 
  well , yeah , the heading did n't mention the absolute ( or absolute rubbish ) amount : $ 523.6 so hooray !, 
  oh , they even have a putin propaganda website . 
  you 'll love it , it 's true : http://www.fort-russ.com/ if someone says this site is fake news , he 's a total loser . 
  unbelievable . 
  lel ... and no mention of the red button ? 
  i did n't expect this to be such a touchy subject but oh well  maybe the way i phrased it ( `` their problem '' ) was not the proper way to say it - i might have got lost in tranlation . 
  i meant it in the sense that it 's not my business to judge them , and ( at least in romanian ) `` not my problem '' and `` not my business '' are almost synonyms ( we say it `` nu e treaba mea '' / `` nu e problema mea '' ) . 
  so i was not implying a problem exists , but rather i was stating it 's their business and not mine to judge ( their problem , and not mine - but `` problem '' in the sense of `` matter '' / subject/issue/thing , not in the sense of a problem per se , as a negative thing ) . 
  i confess that i 'm not familiarised with the psychology of homosexuality and i did n't put too much thought in the `` choice '' thing . 
  superficially , i might have seen it as a matter of choice and i stand corrected - i can understand it 's not a matter of choice , as per your explanation . 
  regarding the evolutionary perspective , i 'm rather stubborn on this . 
  we as living beings are meant to be born , grow and prosper , multiply and pass our genes to the offspring . 
  this is just how evolution works . 
  i did n't know homosexuality is common in animals ( maybe except bonobos ) and even if it is , i do n't think it 's normal , for the very reason expressed in my preceding statement . 
  all the animals `` do whatever is needed '' to survive and pass their genes . 
  this is how evolution works . 
  if hypothetically or not , an 100 % homosexual animal would exists , this is a no-go from a purely evolutionary perspective .

  i am all for an independent osetia , i do n't want to demonize the russians , but that was an abuse of power in the eu 's back yard , which should have had serious consequences . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  you do realize nobody is actually attacking us right ? 
  and in fact your complete disregard for diplomacy in the middle east is the only reason muslim terrorists even attack europe . 
  stop fucking pretending that us interventions are for freedom , when the whole world hates you for your continuous imperialist tendencies . 
  you have armed more dictators and destabilized more countries in the last century than the soviet union . 
  you live in a police state , your secret services control your government and you 're population is okay with it , your political system is fundamentally corrupt and inefficient and the best part is you are constitutionally blindsided from having a true multi party system . 
  and despite all of this you still delude yourself about how morally superior your freedom and democracy are . 
   your entire economy is dependent on the us navy you are more delusional than suicide bombers . 
  fuck you , fuck american exceptionalism and fuck your short exceptionally racist history , you have always been a country of rich ass holes fucking the average citizen , you are not and never will be a model for any humane society . 
  i agree , but keep in mind that all nations disappear . 
  ok so what if china wants to be that hegemon ? 
  do they fight it out until there 's nothing left to rule over ? 
  i tend to disagree , even russians ( except for the progresives ) accept that putin is russia . 
  and progresives can only rejoice at a more opened russia . 
  yes , and guess what made ww1 so bloody and pointless ? 
  that 's nationalism for you , the propaganda sounds like this bucovina is populated with romanians they deserve to live in romania . 
  but when hungary does it with magyars , we to go into panic about other peoples imperialistic ambitions . 
  do n't worry , we do n't care enough , its just propaganda . 
  no , but if you want russia to improve , treating it like the enemy wo n't work . 
  if you offer them a chance to become the good guy , they 're ego make that happen . 
  a megalomaniacal leader like putin would be extremely docile if you put the possibility of russia joining the eu . 
  the concept of him uniting east and west , of bringing russia to the forefront of 20 ` th century diplomacy , bringing russians economic prosperity for decades to come and assure his place on the white pages of history . 
  people are n't inherently evil , they just make selfish decisions . 
  i believe in self interest and that aggression is a sign of weakness , so my choice is self-evident . 
  fortunately i 'm not a diplomat . 
  but more importantly i think russia ( it 's leaders ) needs the eu ( and china ) to prosper and prevent an americentric world . 
   the construct that acts against russia is nato yeah , because its 1973  would you risk a global nuclear exchange for the sake of a few georgians ? 
  would russia ? 
  but considering that the eu is the probably the most important trade partner for russia alternative solutions could have been found . 
  wait , what ? 
  xenophobic propaganda sir , j'accuse !, 
  we are split on the matter of moldova , and they do n't have a barrage barrier . 
  believe me we would like an empire but we 're to poorly organised and to lazy for that sort of thing . 
  i 'm not blaming they eu , i just pointed out that the line should have been drawned then and there , it was a less complicated situation than the `` grey '' nature of ukraine . 
  when you article is so bias and disregards the fact that that the `` putsch '' was backed by a astounding victory in the following parliamentary election , the subject becomes more why is the autor so bias rather than what the propaganda says . 
  the pdl is the have no right to comment on matters of power abuse after the manor in which they governed . 
  you just need them to visit romania and see the progress , oh ... wait ... nevermind but seriously , old people die , youg people become more influential politically , ukraine 2020 ftw !, 
  any ideas that do n't cost money , and wo n't aggravate russia ? 
  to be truly fair , they are a business , they need to fail , nobody forced them to overleverage and accumulate dangerous assets . 
  failure is good for markets , it kills of businesses that have a toxic behavior and makes room for younger companies , that can consolidate the market with new practices and products . 
  the cycle of governments using banks to appease the population and banks making risky money because they know governments ca n't afford a financial failure has to stop . 
  the increase in reserves is n't enough on its own , it just means banks can take more risks , and if those reserves are n't even they 're own money it will be business as usual . 
  by forcing banks to increase reserves out of their own pockets ( or their shareholders pockets ) you limit their propensity for risk , because it 's their money now . 
  you need to force them to change their behavior , not consolidate their past mistakes with free money . 
  about the author  in 2006 , romanian president traian b\u0103sescu appointed him head of the presidential commission for the study of the communist dictatorship in romania , which presented its report to the romanian parliament in december of that year . 
  as of 2009 , tism\u0103neanu is also chairman of the academic board , institute of people 's studies -- an institution affiliated with the democratic liberal party , which in turn is the main political group supportive of b\u0103sescu 's policies . 
  the institution is presided upon by political scientist andrei \u021a\u0103ranu . 
  the following year , tism\u0103neanu was chosen by democratic liberal premier emil boc to lead , with ioan stanomir , the institute for the investigation of communist crimes in romania , substituting the national liberal party 's choice marius oprea . 
  tism\u0103neanu was dismissed by the newly-formed victor ponta government in may 2012 . 
  tl ; dr he 's pissed of his friends are n't in power anymore . 
  this is amazing , i bet most people did n't even realise this was offensive until some young liberal asked what jidov means . 
  witch i totally agree with , but i was just making the distinction between self-reliance and sustainable . 
  the czech republic is a country , it ca n't be a capital ( not even as a metaphor ) . 
  i doubt 87 % of youth smoked cannabis , maybe if you count the synthetic alternatives . 
  a business owner goes to a bank and asks for a loan , the bank rejects him , saying : we do n't trust you , with our money . 
  the business owner leaves and sells some assets , to get the money . 
  a bank goes to the government and asks for a loan , the government says we do n't trust you , the bank responds : do you think you have a choice ? 
  it 's kinda like that saying : if you kill a couple of people you become a criminal , if you kill millions , you become a hero . 
   that maaaybe we might have turned ourselves around african and amazonian tribes older than the first indo-europeans contradict your hypothetical  i fucking love provocation people here on reddit . 
  it 's hilarious . 
  i know , especially if its some arrogant , ignorant , racist westerner that does n't get how first world he is . 
  clones ? 
  really ? 
  we are the most diverse and heterogeneous continent , trough most of our history even small countries like bulgaria and lithuania had periods of glory and empire , that fuels their national ego . 
  latvia 's time is now , i read an article recently that described how your countries focus on it is creating the foundations for a strong reliable service economy . 
  yes the past is horrible , but why care ? 
  why hold a grudge when you can enjoy freedom and prosperity in the present and work together for the future . 
  or realising that the age of 2 national armies competing to see who has more corpses to spare is gone , and no one country is strong enough to fight for it 's interest in a age of superpowers, 
  no , that moment was in 2008 when russia invaded georgia . 
  we missed it . 
   and this is why it 's so important to focus on renewable energies y' all . 
  only china makes solar panels cheap enough to be a cost efficient alternative . 
  sustainable is different from self-sustainable . 
  i feel for ukraine but a large part of the population is still pro russian , anything more drastic that a diplomatic `` talking to '' would only alienate the pro russians and make russia look like the good guy neutral power . 
  actually after microsoft 's `` back door '' scandal , any national agency that has n't changed to linux is irresponsible . 
  the american army is not a positive example , it is funded without any sense of measure or common sense , we should not compare ourselves with them . 
  also , the author exaggerates external threats , unstable foreign countries are n't a threat , and peacekeeping campaigns are different than invasions and wars . 
  the article does raise a good point when it comes to efficiency , but considering that each big country has different geopolitical interests and small countries are more concerned with reducing spending now that they do n't actually have direct threats i do n't see a united army as an option anytime soon , at least not until there is a unified foreign agenda . 
   such is life . 
  seeing as her ancestors have failed for thousands of years chances are she will too . 
  keep that stoicism when you 'll be unlucky . 
  so you feel that somehow natives have more rights ... just because ... what about second and third generation immigrants ? 
  or mixed race children , an immigrant has a baby with a local . 
  where is the line ? 
  we do n't matter when it comes to history , legacy , or war , we do matter for our family our friends , this is why risking our life her a hero fantasy is not heroic is selfish and delusional . 
   it 's nice to fight for a politician 's ideals . 
  i mean real causes which you believe in . 
  if only this was the case , but we are prgramed to follow leaders and adapt our ideal to theirs . 
  because all people follow their self interest , if you give them a job , take care of their children and give them the change to earn a decent living and do n't squash their identity and self respect , they would be crazy to give it up , just to live in squalor and risk their life for `` religious ideals '' . 
  some will , but i guarantee that he will be beaten and reported to the authorities by members of his own community . 
  because each city handled hate gypsies issue differently , some moved the community out of the city , others tried out reach programs , in most cases it was solved just by preventing illegal activities if they realise the risk of tricking the system is great they wo n't be tempted , and giving them the possibility to earn a decent wage.people do n't break the law because they 're sociopaths , in most cases , they break it because they see their neighbours doing it , gettin away with it and getting more value from it than he is from his regular low level job . 
  well maybe some cops where racist and that termed cached on for the media . 
  but i agree political correctness is doing a disservice for the immigrant community by promoting animosity among the rest of the population and tolerating illegal activities within their comunity . 
  so he does n't get a chance to fight , at all , because he 's unlucky . 
  cool . 
   no ghettos , no homeless where did you grow up ? 
  ( joke alert ) the airport ? 
   just like they did with their former countries ( read previous comments about context is limiting and why they did n't choose to be poor )  mosques are ugly i totally disagree i think they are beautiful strictly from an esthetic point of view , some of sicily 's best architecture is composed out of mosques . 
  but esthetics is highly subjective .

   the scholarships are aimed at training specialists in areas of interest for afghanistan , according to a statement from the government . 
  they will be granted annually over a period of five years , for undergraduate studies , master , and doctorate , as well as postgraduate medical education . 
   the ten afghan students will benefit from free university education , monthly scholarships , free accommodation in student dormitories , free healthcare , and free transport . 
   by granting these scholarships , romania aims to strengthen relations between the two countries and reconfirms its commitment as a member state of the european union and nato to contribute to the peace in the region and the reconstruction of the afghan state , according to the government . 
  sure , i am aware of that and i 'm glad we 're consolidating our defense . 
  also , i know that those measures are preferable by russia right now ( although they have no effect on romania at the moment ) and i 've always said that if russia were to physically attack us , it would be purely out of madness and not logic , knowing they ca n't win against nato as it is today . 
  sure , it would still mean a lot of destruction on the front lines if putin would be crazy enough to do it but russia would ultimately lose . 
  at least as long as china does n't side with them or something . 
  people here have said that they would n't but i do n't know . 
   whel imagine russian troop build up in mexico , would n't that be a provocation ? 
  assuming mexico will let russian troops on its territory . 
  i guess you 'd rather cower at your enemies ' feet and hope they wo n't suddenly attack you ? 
  pretty easy to speak when you 're not from eastern europe and you do n't know its history with russia . 
  they happen so often you get used to them lol, 
  training exercises and security missions . 
  yeah , but when this much activity takes place in your country , you start to wonder if there 's actually a possibility of something happening . 
  we 're also neighbours with ukraine and crimea is quite close so russia is never too far away from us . 
  we 're the front lines , as one would say . 
  moldova is that a challenge ???

  yes , i think that 's it :d, 
  we rank 76 and that is upsetting, 
  there is so much nato activity in romania at the moment . 
  from all sides , but mainly the us . 
  i find that comforting and alarming at the same time . 
   the british royal air force ( raf ) will send typhoon fighter jets to romania in 2017 , uk defense secretary michael fallon announced on wednesday , october 26 . 
   the typhoons will be based at the mihail kogalniceanu airbase in southeast romania for up to four months next year . 
   `` the defence secretary said that the uk will commit raf typhoon aircraft to the nato southern air policing mission to offer reassurance to the black sea allies . 
  deployed from raf coningsby , the typhoons will be based at mihail kogalniceanu airbase , romania , for up to four months in 2017 , '' reads a statement from british ministry of defense . 
   the typhoon aircraft will participate in missions of air police and will counter any infringement of the nato airspace in the southeast , reports local digi24 . 
   the uk 's announcement comes as nato defense ministers meet on october 26-27 in brussels to discuss the plans for a strengthened nato presence in the eastern part of the alliance and in the black sea region , and russia 's recent military activity along nato 's borders . 
   uk becomes the second nato ally that sends military equipment to romania . 
  us will also deploy an armored battalion in romania in early 2017 , part of its commitment to increase military presence in eastern europe . 
   romania also hosts american troops and military gear at its mihail kogalniceanu airbase , close to the black sea port of constanta . 
  romania also hosts a nato anti-ballistic missile system at the deveselu military base . 
   a nato command center is already functional in bucharest and a multinational nato brigade will also be created in craiova , southern romania . 
   nato warships have also rotated in the black sea regularly in the past two years , also part of the alliance 's efforts to keep an eye on russia 's operations in the region , after the annexation of crimea . 
  us destroyer uss carney made a stop in romania 's constanta port on tuesday , october 25 . 
  the destroyer is equipped with the aegis ballistic missile defense system . 
  well in that case i 'm all for eu * imposing * it on them .

   the european parliament adopted a resolution urging the european commission to replace the cooperation and verification mechanism ( cvm ) , which targets romania and bulgaria , with an instrument aimed to assess the state of democracy and rule of law in all eu member states . 
   to end the current `` crisis-driven '' approach to perceived breaches of democracy , the rule of law and fundamental rights in eu member states , the european commission should set up a binding eu mechanism to monitor and report annually on their records in these fields , the meps said in a resolution passed on tuesday . 
  this mechanism should include objective benchmarks and lay down a gradual approach to remedying breaches , they added . 
   the european commission should create a binding mechanism for the annual monitoring of data in these fields , according to the resolution adopted by the european parliament . 
  the parliament asked the commission to present a proposal by september 2017 for a union pact for democracy , the rule of law and fundamental rights in the form of an inter-institutional agreement aligning and complementing existing mechanisms . 
   the cooperation and verification mechanism was introduced by the european commission when romania and bulgaria joined the eu in 2007 to monitor the progress of the two countries on the rule of law , corruption fight , and , in the case of bulgaria , to counter organized crime . 
   the european commission has been publishing the cvm reports on romania and bulgaria every year , at the end of january . 
  the latest cvm reports show that romania has made significant progress in fighting top-level corruption in recent years , which is why some politicians in bucharest have been asking the european commission to remove romania from the cooperation and verification mechanism . 
  happy national day , austria !, 
  hey , at least your economy 's great ,

   i was only trying to say that you ca n't brush aside the argument by saying the government is popular . 
  you make a very good point . 
  many governments and leaders have been popular with the people but that does n't mean they were exactly good . 
  even in romania , the corrupt social democratic party has quite a few fans and is more popular than the liberals , but that does n't make them any less corrupt and stupid .

   romania will have to spend `` tens of millions of euros '' to ensure the eu council presidency in 2019 , romanian prime minister dacian ciolos said on monday . 
   `` by our calculations , we 're talking about a cost of tens of millions of euros for preparing and running the eu council presidency . 
  this is the money that will also contribute to promoting romania 's image , money that should enable us also to prepare the administrative , logistical part , '' ciolos said , according to local agerpres . 
   he added that the future government will decide if the informal councils will be held in bucharest or other cities . 
  the informal councils bring hundreds of officials from eu member states to the country that holds the eu council presidency and are a good opportunity to promote the host-country . 
   holding council meetings in other cities than bucharest would require additional logistic and organizing costs but would also allow romania to promote other cities and regions than the capital , according to ciolos . 
   the presidency of the eu council rotates among the eu member states every six months . 
  slovakia is currently ensuring the council 's presidency , its term ending on december 31 , 2016 . 
   the romanian presidency will start on january 1 and will end on june 30 , 2019 . 
  prime minister dacian ciolos said his cabinet has almost finalized a master-plan of priority actions to be taken for the administrative and technical preparation of the romanian presidency of the eu council . 
  he added that two and a half years is not a long period to prepare this event . 
   ciolos also said that the government has already started evaluating the human resources available in public administration to select those people that are trained well enough to coordinate the project , who will form what he called the `` elite corps '' of romanian administration . 
  this group will have to manage a few thousands of meetings of working groups and special committees . 
  bulgaria , * no * :o, 
  i think you 're reaching because you deal in absolutes right now . 
  it 's either * vote against your and your people 's wishes/concerns just so the rest can be happy * or * fuck the eu let 's start wwiii or something * . 
  both scenarios are unlikely . 
  regarding ceta ... i do n't know . 
  i feel like it could have been discussed more , not just among the officials , but with the people of the european union . 
  i think , given the information and the chance to vote on it , the people of more countries than just belgium would choose to veto the deal . 
  dude , you literally shouted about auschwitz,

  lead integration efforts on our terms and with our people positioned in first . 
  and in concord beat down france and germany as a voting block . 
  we can do this , but we need a bit more than talking about `` muh sovereignty '' and how the eu is oppressing us . 
  the problem is we are n't . 
  we are obstructionists , waiting to be cut down . 
  and if we continue on this strategy we will be cut down .

  the uk with it 's desire to keep us in our own countries to work the mines for peanuts while they exported us finished good definetly was pushing for something along those lines , but they also needed voting allies .

  now , take your historical role , ignore the advice and join the rest of the cautionary tales .

  the question is if poles will allow poland to go full ceausescu ?

  `` i know it 's shit so i seek safety in false equivalence and the extremism of other people '', 
  how do you organize the discussions ? 
  between which people ? 
  how are commands transmitted ? 
  how are responsibilities and tasks assigned ? 
  how are mistakes and faults reviewed and corrected ? 
  simply put asking for `` coordination and cooperation '' in place of integration is more often than not a vague way of saying `` do nothing , because i have no idea '' . 
  while any sufficiently advanced form of coordination to actually give a result will be qualitatively indistinguishable from integration , because it needs some sort of integration . 
  how ? 
  and how do you think that can be done without integration ? 
  the polish taliban proving they do n't need middle eastern immigrants to become a middle eastern country . 
  romania had dealt with this stupidity , and we 've learned how toxic it can be . 
  after that `` we do n't want to be part of europol , but can we please get an exception and sort of be part of europol '' debacle , i 'm pretty sure this wo n't try to include denmark or anyone else who is n't quite sure where they stand in the union . 
  it 's becoming clear the eu expanded too fast and an opportunity has presented itself to undo a lot of past damage . 
  why would they do that when they can just kick you out ? 
  eastern europeans are really giving themselves airs these days . 
  time was no one was even sure we 'd be allowed in the eu , now we think we 're doing france and germany a favour by staying . 
  it 's a form of madness . 
  it 's cheap but it 's also croatia . 
  if croatian service workers start asking more more , there are few locations in the eu that can compare . 
  but if this pattern continues , they can bring romanian or bulgarian workers to work on croatian beaches for less than an average croatian . 
  i 'm thinking this in the long term `` what happens when we 're on the receiving end of this policy '' way . 
  i do n't want to be told i should employ myself in the macedonian branch and get paid less while still working and living in romania or get fired . 
  the eu is n't involved in nord stream 2 . 
  all the members , east and germany , were careful to avoid having the eu make a political decision . 
  all complaints were limited to economic regulations , which did n't apply . 
  this is another example why intergovernmental negotiation does n't work , and why the eu is needed to stop germany by vote instead of asking it nicely . 
  i 'm growing numb to the many times the eu is blamed for 19th century politics prefered by the eurosceptics . 
  [ this is what happens when you turn the eu into a purely economic entity .

  if that goes against their stated ideology , it makes their stated ideology a lie does n't it ? 
  i think i 'm getting the measure of you , millz . 
  let me guess , loyal pis supporter ? 
  that would explain a lot . 
  we could also give the hungarian company the right to pay their workers in a handfull potatoes instead of money , and ignore worker safety . 
  that would also improve competition . 
  there is a sweat spot here where we can allow fair competition , without destroying the east chances of ever catching up with the west . 
  but it ca n't be done by turning us into the equivalent of large labour camps , where average people are trotted out to build for the west and then sent back to the happiest barracks . 
  i think you hit the nail on the head and got it . 
  both are being somewhat unreasonable in their demands , but there is a clear middle ground there that a sensible person can see clearly . 
  that is not how it works . 
  if the company has a branch in hungary it uses for this stuff , then the hungarian worker will be `` encouraged '' to `` stay '' in hungary or be replaced with someone else from hungary or from another eastern country . 
  and if hungarian unions start gaining ground croation or bulgarian `` temporary '' workers will be transfered to hungary to teach them a lesson . 
  see , all the power is with the corporation not the person . 
  and are you seriously hoping to be the west 's sweatshop ? 
  is that the ambition there ? 
  do better !, 
  to begin with , that competition is exactly the reason the cohesion funds exist , to give back to the community . 
  secondly , this is not even about getting outcompeted with hungarian worker . 
  this is the hungarian worker being turned into cheap labour even outside hungary , pretty much second class citizens . 
  the issue is that it 's an abuse of an eu system made specifically to allow free movement of workers within a company , called the [ posted workers directive 1996 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/posted_workers_directive_1996 ) . 
  normally it would only involve temporary transfers , but it 's being used on a more permanent basis to replace local workers , while denying transferred workers western wages despite working in western countries with western prices . 
  so it 's european law not french , and is not so much being broken , but being abused . 
  honestly , you 're engaging in more than a bit of self-victimization . 
  eastern workers want higher wages . 
  western workers want eastern worker to have higher wages . 
  there 's no conflict there . 
  but the polish government want those western companies to locate branches in poland they can then use to keep polish worker wages low and taxing them on the profit they make as a result , because you do n't notice the wages you 're not getting you notice the job that you now have despite the fact that you might have it anyway minus the legal loophole . 
  this is not a battle where the polish government can take the moral highground . 
  they are actively trying to keep polish wages low despite their workers being perfectly able to work their jobs under the western labour agreements . 
  despite the privacy concerns , and despite the likely sarcasm , i think this is a step in the right direction . 
  all of us have phone tapping and home search laws .

  cheers . 
  when you spent 40 years demonizing yourselves , your culture and your ethnicity and trying to destroy both your national defense and masculinity because war and testosterone are toxic . 
  this is the culmination of decades of constant , unrelenting propaganda and witch hunts against everything `` right wing '' . 
  defending yourself is racist , being masculine is toxic , not following the right political ideology is a faux pas . 
  all of that combined with the general laziness and moral myopia that comes after years of prosperity and lack of hardships . 
  years of `` it wo n't happen to us '' because you 're not used to it happening to you . 
  well , here it is . 
  it is happening because importing the third world also imports their problems and you can not defend yourselves from them because you have demonized your white-cells and castrated yourselves as nations . 
  ` course they will . 
  we 're always 10 years behind and the liberals will win because the new generation will want to get on the same politically correct high the west has been until it started fucking them over . 
  there 's no real `` right '' government in eastern europe , or at least in romania . 
  in here , they 're all thieves . 
  not to diminish your point , but https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_speech_zone though sweden 's still pretty awful at it . 
  balkan threads are always a blast . 
  i find it kind of sketchy that the west is now concerning itself with what poland is doing after , as far as i hear , every government until now has done exactly the same thing , especially the one backed by germany . 
  europe do this , europe do that , why europe must do this , europe must do that , this is happening and europe must accept it . 
  getting tired of this shit . 
  romanians in transylvania faced the same . 
  hungarians reacted violently to people even asking for basic rights and vetoed any kind of reform or right by the hapsburg government . 
  if you did n't convert to catholicism and take a hungarian name , you were n't allowed in cities , were n't freedom of worship , were n't allowed anything . 
  everyone else feels the same . 
  croats , romanians , serbs , slovaks , all sided with the assburgers and all got shafted when they gave greater power to the hungarians . 
  no , there 's no fucking saucy passages in the new testament where jesus says you should go conquer , should treat infidels like enemies , should beat your wife to keep her in her place and where he 's bragging about being a warlord . 
  probably because islam has fun stuff like `` the sword of islam '' or passages about mohammed saying muslims should conquer constantinople , the religious center of christianity . 
  probably because hillary is being investigated by the cia and is apparently also taking part of fucking satanic rituals . 
  i find it hard to swallow that the increase in reported sex crimes is just coincidental with the increase of migrators from non-european countries but alright , let 's play that game . 
  this post better be ironic . 
  in here , it only happens between gypsies . 
  normal people ca n't even concieve doing such a thing . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nin6ciw1ws maybe this is rap in muslim countries . 
  did n't it fall because latins refused to help them anymore ? 
  and like only a few mercenaries turned up and catholic countries did n't answer the pope 's call for a crusade because they were too busy either fighting eachother or fighting themselves . 
  yeah , and ngos chimped out when we tried to stop that . 
  nothing but gumdrops and ice cream in the rest of europe , eh ? 
  what duty ? 
  why is it a duty for anyone to accept migrants ? 
  made my cockatiel go apeshit and woke up my entire household . 
  yeah , i felt it . 
  `` the romanian nation does not belong to a single ethnic group . '', 
  except it does . 
  contrary to what you might think , everything from the revolutions , the union of the two principalities and to the union with transylvania was to create a land for all ethnic romanians . 
  even the name , which might sound iffy , does not come from `` romanian land '' . 
  it has evolved from `` rom\u00e2nie '' , which means `` romanianship '' or `` lands inhabited by ethnic romanians '' . 
  syrian school institutions were a joke before the war even started . 
  this `` educated refugees '' meme needs to die and get buried already because if any middle east and north african country had any kind of passable quality or credidentials , they would n't be coming to countries like romania of all places to get a degree . 
  same . 
  i need cashiers to remind me we 're not using millions and thousands anymore . 
  it feels like yesterday when we had michael the brave coins , too . 
  nah , it 's just easy for the average redneck to learn spanish and italian . 
  or easy to learn just enough words to do their jobs as truck drivers or masons . 
  you can start paying taxes and abandoning caravans , too , and not bitch at ngo 's every time we say that maybe you should get jobs that qualify you as citizens of the country . 
  mighty talk coming from behind your monitor , dipshit . 
  i find it hilarious that whenever there 's a thread about kosovo , albanians come out of the woodwork and blame serbs for everything . 
  talk shit , get hit . 
  kosovo is n't a nation , and sticking your fingers in your ears and going lalalala is n't going to help anything . 
  i always find it hilarious when someone with a swedish flag posts something pro-albanians . 
  truth is somewhere in the middle-ish . 
  the most likely theory is that the romanian people formed in modern day oltenia , banat , apuseni mountains and eastern serbia and migrated east-ward either due slavic migrations or aggression . 
  it 's also been pointed out that the fact that we also use hungarian words for basic things such as `` city '' , `` border '' , `` people '' , `` serf '' and `` suffering '' means that a significant part of our ethnogenesis happened during the magyar occupation of pannonia and transylvania , and that if we migrated north-wards in the traditional date of 1200 's , we would 've had these words already from bulgarians , serbs or albanians . 
  or maybe we can push the date a bit more and go all the way to the partition and the targowica confederation . 
  glossing over the `` slavic countries like romania '' comment , it 's probably because we 've had nothing but conflicts with them since the 19th century , all of which they started . 
  who gives a shit . 
  they 're protecting their interests because they can . 
  i wish we could , too . 
  i begrudge them for everything they 've done to us but i do n't begrudge them for this because i 'm not an idealistic idiot who thinks life is or should be fair . 
  maybe people can have a nuanced opinion . 
  being a romanian , i resent every incarnation of russia and their leadership , but ukraine is a failed state and crimea was never theirs . 
  retarded borders drawn by communists should not have any weight in the modern world , and since i feel that bukovina and bugeac belongs to us , it 'd be hypocritical of me to say that crimea does n't belong to russia . 
  i get it , but it 's not making me laugh . 
  maybe not everything is about or related to your lil ' liberation . 
  tito . 
  or maybe a culture where stealing from ghadzi ( non-gypsies ) is considered a good thing is unfit for integration . 
  lmaoing at this thread, 
  one million people crossing into europe , for starters . 
  it 's not that they had more say , it 's that they had less say when they were n't ruling themselves . 
  under ottoman law , a christian was underprivileged compared to a muslim . 
  under the hapsburg empire , hungarians and germans and szekelys had more rights than croatians , serbs and romanians . 
  do n't you realize that crime that goes unpunished by the police tends to piss people the fuck off . 
  not exactly sure what you mean . 
  do you mean that borders , sovereignity and ethnically defined nations and borders did n't exist then ? 
  because those concepts are things that greeks philosophers were talking about in the 6th century bc . 
  or do you mean big empires coming around and shuffling up the ethnic compositions through massacres , deportations , colonization and resettling , because everywhere else it happened it had the same effect on people as it did in the balkans . 
  the ottoman empire took away sovereignity from people and things started to get messy . 
  we all did . 
  cried even harder when i realized i was born in fsn 's romania . 
  i 'm perfectly okay with it . 
  i 'd cry too if i landed in romania instead of the land of milk and germoney . 
  man , those gymnasiums next to general schools that they put them in must be horrifying . 
  i guess i did n't see it in the pictures because they were covered by all the women and children . 
  you can be a refugee who wants best job opportunities , but you stop being a refugee once you abandon a safe zone to get there . 
  you start being an economic migrant . 
  islam operates on a different level . 
  what stopped your country from not participating like we did ? 
  do you think this is funny, 
  this is n't a fuck up . 
  it 's the equivalent of calling in a bomb threat and `` polish death camps '' combined . 
  because muslims have done absolutely nothing recently to warrant such reactions . 
  the romanian government gives them more rights than to ethnic romanians . 
  they have free scholarships in universities , they get social benefits , the crooked officials illegally sell them historical propriety from the transylvanian saxons that were deported or from the gentry that was culled during communism . 
  in parts of transylvania and banat , the gypsy mafia is law and it 's almost entirely because the government officials are in cahoots with them .

   they rely on the state budget , and if they 'd have autonomy the state wo n't give them shit anymore . 
  not necessarily . 
  they could still get money , the thing they want is to have a higher degree of decision on how they manage that money . 
  i am insulted by the fact that eastern europe is left out . 
  i mean my children will probably be a minority as well . 
  why are we left out of this map ? 
  because we 're not `` western '' ? 
  because we 're not being overtaken by muslims ? 
  in 40 years the majority of eastern europe will have a [ roma gypsy majority ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45881000/jpg/_45881135_007456212-1.jpg ) , but you do n't care do you ? 
  to hell with the easterners , right ? 
  typical western arrogance !, 
  to keep in mind :  the document is clearly not a final version and subject to change . 
  the articles i linked to in [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europeans/comments/2ezxo2/eu_summit_to_choose_van_rompuys_and_ashtons/ ) might be of help . 
  it 's not about hate . 
  explanation [ here ] ( http://wheresmysammich.com/picture/63700/7-wonders-from-caracal/ ) . 
  romans and dacians . 
  romans because we speak a romance language , and [ dacians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dacians ) because they lived round here , and were probably \u201e our ancestors '' genetically speaking . 
  it 's all fun and games until someone looses a province ... 
  vaslui * county * is the butt of jokes , but as a city , caracal is king . 
  found [ another map ] ( http://lohvitsa.org.ua/_fr/3/5218938.jpg ) via google . 
  serpent 's wall sections are numbers 5 to 11 . 
  oh , that is very true . 
  part of [ this photoessay ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2014/08/nato-russian-soldiers-are-now-in-ukraine/100800/ ) . 
  i have a feeling the pro-russia-ness of orban is exagerated a bit . 
   they are massively over-represented in the parliament . 
  `` massively '' ? 
  the are a bit over-represented because of voter-redistribution and higher discipline of the electorate , but that just means that instead of 6 % they have maybe 7-8 % of mps . 
  remembered another : not a noun , but an adjective : '' [ \u0163ais ] ( http://dexonline.ro/definitie/%c8%9bais/541719 ) '' from [ zeiss ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_zeiss_ag ) , meaning of great quality/precision . 
   `` general purpose vehicle '' yep . 
  a `` g.p. 
  vehicle '' , 
   palatschinken is also a german word it 's [ romanian ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/palatschinke ) . 
  it entered german from hungarian actually . 
   are you sure it was borrowed from romanian ? 
  i 'm not sure , but in romania it 's used a lot , and i think it survived because romanian also uses `` frigider '' for fridge . 
  even if it did n't enter via romanian ( it 's very possible it entered via german ) , it survived in transilvania because of it . 
  here it 's [ finetti ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wlzdptxf34w/tfa3umv-y8i/aaaaaaaaalw/t0zqyzf67a0/s1600/img_4925+%2528large%2529.jpg ) , which is a local brand . 
  every chocolate/nougat cream that is not nutella is called finetti . 
   ** flex ** for angle grinders  ** plexiglas ** for poly ( methyl 2-methylpropenoate ) ,  ** rigips ** for drywall  ** tetrapak ** for plastic coated paper carton food containers . 
  yes , 
  \u201e palacsinta '' is the most obvious ( borrowed by many others as well ) . 
  in general we lent words that have to do with shepherding to our neighbours . 
  on the other hand , regional varieties of hungarian are full of romanian loan-words ( especially in szeklerland ) . 
  for example , in some areas , the local name for that most hungarian of vegetables , the pepper , is called \u201e argyej '' , because it came via wallachia . 
  a lot of standard hungarian names for vegetables are alien to me , as i use the romanianized version . 
  the most interesting etymological journey imo is \u201e vin\u00e9tta '' , which means eggplant in transylvanian hungarian , but has come to mean \u201e eggplant salad '' in standard hungarian ( where eggplant salad was brought recently by transylvanian hungarians who called it \u201e vin\u00e9tta sal\u00e1ta '' ) . 
  the standard hungarian word for eggplant is \u201e padlizs\u00e1n '' , which comes from turkish and is cognate with the romanian \u201e p\u0103tl\u0103gea '' ( \u201e v\u00een\u0103t\u0103 '' itself is a contraction from \u201e p\u0103tl\u0103gea v\u00e2n\u0103t\u0103 '' ) . 
  \u201e fridzsider '' also entered coloquial hungarian in transilvania , via romanian , or maybe it entered from french but survived because of romanian . 
  used in romanian too . 
  pronounced either \u201e f\u00f6n '' or \u201e fion '' ( there is no \u00d6 in romanian ) . 
  [ dero ] ( http://www.i-comert.ro/files/product/original/dero-surf-automat-detergent-221.jpg ) - for detergent ( which is an abbreviation for `` detergent rom\u00e2nesc '' - romanian detergent ) ^ ^ til [ helas ] ( http://www.elcasio.ro/helas.jpg ) - [ lemon juice substitute ] ( http://www.lemondressing.gr/english/html/home.htm ) ps in hungarian * [ eternit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eternit ) * - [ asbestos fibre cement ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/wellasbestdach-233-3354_img.jpg/800px-wellasbestdach-233-3354_img.jpg ) hard disk drive is \u201e winchester '' afaik , after a the [ ibm3340 hard disk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_ibm_magnetic_disk_drives#ibm_3340 ) . 
  yeah . 
  it means \u201e friendship '' , 
  because communists created forced cooperative farms , the people really wanted their land back , so it got fragmented into a lot of little plots . 
  add to that the fact that the rural areas are aging , the land is underworked , as most agriculture is subsitence . 
  but that is slowly changing , due to eu subsidies . 
  do n't worry , we 're working on upgrading our agricultural capabilities . 
  ^ ^ ^ thanks ^ ^ ^ eu, 
   i think if you have a dinner and reach a consensus at that dinner what if they go to the office afterwards and have a show of hands afterwards , so it 's clear to everyone that they have a consensus . 
  there has to be a moment when they establish that the consensus exists . 
  a moment when they count the \u201e aye '' s and \u201e nay '' s to establish that they do , in fact , have a consensus . 
  can that moment count as a vote ? 
  well then , what constitutes a vote . 
  does a \u201e who 's in favor ? '' followed by a raising of hands constitute a vote ? 
  i think you 're really wasting too much energy debating the exact word used here . 
  but if in an election all the electors vote the same way , it 's still an election , is it not ? 
  i guess so . 
  all the members agreed on him . 
  i 'm not sure on the exact protocol , but if they could n't reach a consensus it could have been decided by qualified majority vote , like juncker was . 
  see discussion here : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2f0ppr/donald_tusk_has_just_been_elected_as_the_next/, 
  because mogherini is a comissioner , and still has to go through the whole ep grilling process , just like all the other comissioners , and only after that does she get the job . 
  tusk on the other hand just got the job . 
  he only needed the council to elect him . 
  ( i think ) . 
  her french is tip top as well , i see .

  yeah , me 3 . 
  or at the very least not mogherini . 
  no , and tusk 's nomination ( center-right , eastern european , man ) would mean that mogherini 's chances got extremely good ( center-left , western european , female ) , unfortunately . 
  see [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ez9ce/a_fivepoint_guide_to_the_eu_top_jobs_puzzle/ ) and [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ez9av/european_council_preview_who_will_get_the_eus/ ) to get a feeling of how this whole negotiation algorithm works . 
  i 'm still hoping for a thorning-schmit + georgieva combo ( best in my opinion ) , given that sikorski is probably too hawkish to be acceptable . 
  great post , but yer venn diagrams are n't working ... 
  the cia ? 
  find one that is willing to learn hungarian , 
  interesting . 
  how is this phenomenon viewed ? 
   how common is interracial dating in your country ? 
  if we exclude roma-white dating , which is very common , but which might not be viewed as `` interracial in the traditional sense '' , it 's rare . 
  the most common one after that , which has a long history , is between foreign male students , arab mostly , and some african , and romanian women . 
  the most famous such mixed child is [ cabral ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cabral_ibacka ) , tv host and blogger . 
  another one is [ nadine ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-i26vcbbrrhu/t704qbzibxi/aaaaaaaaapa/mgiiqzlo-eu/s1600/biografie+nadine+vedete+blog.jpg ) , also in showbiz . 
  there are some mixed race kids in my hometown ( hungarian/black and romanian/asian ) and i know of a some friends-of-friends who are centrafrican/romanian , syrianarab/romanian and korean/romanian mix . 
  also , i had a friend whose sister was maried to a syrian dude . 
  while arab/romanian marriages are the most widespread , and not really that shocking , i do n't think `` interracial marriages '' are that widespread in the grand scheme of things . 
  note : jews are not considered a different race , as in the us , they are seen as white . 
   do any of you have a partner of a different race ? 
  not me personally . 
   just like in georgia ? 
  georgia was n't in nato , we are .

  poor pnl , our main opposition party is to stupid to even have a tv channel of their own ... sometimes i really pity these idiots ... 
  schultz did give the spd a pretty big bump , but he slowly lost momentum it looks . 
  bribe taking has went down considerably in recent years . 
  i remember when i was young and went with my brother and father to the doctor , he is in a wheelchair , was born with some problems , we had to bring the nurses and ladies there coffee , chocolate ... etc otherwise we would wait for an eternity . 
  i do n't remember well , as i was little , but my father told me how when they went to bucharest to the doctor there , his car was full with potatos , palinca/tuica , cheese ... etc to give to the staff there , otherwise they would treat him like crap , a nurse even gave my brother old medicine instead of modern ones , if father would n't give her stuff . 
  funny enough , we rarely gave bribes in money , but giving '' gifts '' , like food , drinks . . etc was simply normal , everyone did it, 
  could n't the zoo take care of the other ? 
  man , the 90 's where shit . 
  we do this stuff here to ... we '' bless '' everything . 
  the fact that this actually exists ... 
  hahaha post the pic with her and erdo , to confuse people even more, 
  i went to the london olympics , and it was quite nice . 
  had a great time . 
  still a long time until 2024 , but i 'm glad it 's so close and in europe . 
  this one looks quite nice . 
  combines modernity with traditional patterns , styles quite well . 
  try also looking at lebanon , they have quite a few good looking '' modern '' mosques . 
  still though , i still like more traditional mosques , i find that these new ones lack ... '' soul '' to say so . 
  nothing made in recent years truly compares with [ this ] ( http://gravity.ir/nasir-al-mulk-mosque-in-shiraz/ ) or [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shah_mosque ), 
   which is owned by a friend of guess who ? 
  i simply have no clue ... 
  i really need to find that article i read . 
  a turkish friend sent it to me . 
  it was n't only about mosque building , though it did speak of that as well , but it went into detail on just how corrupt the construction and infrastructure businesses are in turkey . 
  and almost all is related to the akp/erdo, 
  you should also check who owns the construction firm ... etc i have no doubt they have connections with erdo or the akp . 
  they 're carbon-copies , so they can be done faster . 
  easier for the construction firms to make them . 
  would n't be shocked at all if he gives these contracts to friends , who then make a fortune of this . 
  no doubt a lot of corruption , cronyism , nepotism and stealing is involved in these projects . 
  i remember reading an article about this subject earlier this year . 
  i 'll try to find it . 
  edit : great mosque by the way . 
  classical ottoman and iranian are my favourite styles . 
  modern stuff , as mostly always , is just crap . 
  the images and videos coming from the city are just incredible ... stay safe lads . 
  i 'm shocked, 
  so safe , not even we can get it back ... 
  he 's most likely going to go on a tirade calling us '' ungrateful '' for all the '' progress '' and '' industry '' the soviets brought us . 
  is he going to threaten to bomb us again ? 
  this is to much, 
  true , i guess . 
  i lived most of my childhood just a 15 mins drive away from it but i never visited it ... 
  did n't expect a prequal meme here , out of all places ... 
  i do n't deny that , but many are also just islamist , though knowing hiftar he will think these are worst . 
  but how ideological are their soldiers , not leaders ? 
  how many joined for the cash ? 
  how many did it for the fame ... etc during the '' surge '' , which worked quite well in iraq ( well in military terms at least . 
  maliki fucked the political situation in his 2nd term ) , patraeus emphasized the importance of dividing these groups , and realizing that not all of their fighters are ideological . 
  i 'm afraid hiftar will use the '' war on terror '' excuse and target all of them . 
  a good chunk of these militias , would gladly join a united army if they where promised a decent salary ( and perhaps amnesty . 
  the ideological leaders must be taken care of though . 
   r most of them are bad news and should be dismantled fully . 
  this risks uniting them in an anti-hiftar alliance , out of fear . 
  dividing them up as much as possible , and giving their fighters more options , like i said above would be better . 
   haftar should also crack down on militias in sabha . 
  they went full retard i agree more on this . 
  still yet again i would advise dividing them , as much as possible , and not putting them , completely , with their backs at the wall . 
   now realise that libya is a hundred times less stable and have to create something from scratch . 
  an often ignored part . 
  gaddafi , did what all dictators did , destroy civil society and any opposition . 
  he may have built nice roads , but in the long term he doomed libya . 
  a crisis and civil war would 've been very probable after his death , his sons did n't have his influence and prestige and , unlike egypt , the army was a shell , purged and basically dead . 
  this lack of authority was a perfect recipe for the creation of tribal and local militias . 
   this will need a follow up , tho . 
  i hope ... 
  i really hope . 
  that 's why i think , that as many militias from the west have to be merged into a future united army . 
  anything to reduce the salafi influence . 
  i think some ultimatum has to be given , after some sort of unity government is formed , '' join the government and get amnesty '' or something on these lines . 
  let 's be honest , trying to pass '' justice '' will be pointless , all sides did plenty of crimes , looting , killings , rape ... etc haftars ( off-topic , how is the right way haftar or hiftar ? 
  i 've seen libyans themselves writing it both ways ... ) militias are hardly innocent . 
  very good points , and i do agree on most of them . 
  will reply just to a few points :  because it point is to merge civilian sector ( gna ) with military ( lna ) . 
  as i said , i fully support a unity government , i have always supported this . 
  and seeing serraj and hiftar together was very nice . 
   as for qatar and turkey , let me be frank . 
  them . 
  sure , i agree , but hate them or not , they 're still part of this . 
  not having them somehow at least , on board is problematic . 
  i agree that misrata needs to chose , and quickly , if not the entire city , and all the civilians , will suffer . 
  but i 'm also hesitant on hiftar . 
  he has quite a few salafi militias , they already tried shit in tobruk , some time ago . 
  and he has shown a tendency to ally with them against the mb . 
  i have no love for the mb , but i got none for the salafis either . . having imams call ibadis infidels for example . 
  he needs to address this stuff . 
  i do hope the cease-fire will work though , and as i said , i 'm very glad to see serraj together with hiftar . 
  i hope a unity government will be formed soon . 
  i also hope that hiftar does n't try to go full dictator , i think that will simply restart the fighting again . 
  but honestly i doubt he could do it , libya has changed quite a lot , i just ca n't see 1 person holding ultimate power like gaddafi did . 
   i just ca n't imagine elections solving anything every libyan will tell you just this . 
  elections will polarize and divide the country even more . 
  ask any libyan what he thinks the biggest mistake was and he 'll tell '' holding elections so soon '' libya needs 1 or even 2 years under a unity government , they need to write a constitution and create a unified army . 
  ( something they never really had in their history . 
  ghadafi never wrote a constitution , and he destroyed the army out of paranoia ) only then hold elections . 
   the real material conditions and tribal conflicts within libya prevent it . 
  the problem , as silly as it may sound is '' sharing '' . 
  under ghaddafi , they got used to having 1 men decide everything , absolutely everything . 
  now each city , village , tribe ... etc is scared that the governing group , will take all the wealth for themselves . 
  and not without reason ...

  you can not use the bank storage cassettes without someone else present ? 
  fuck that , why did greeks accept such a hummiliation ? 
  that stupid referendum should have been instead `` do you still want euros '' and be done with it . 
  you would 've had 20 bad years and then all back to normal . 
  this is now worse , you will sell everything , still have 20 bad years , and then still have debt for 200 years to come . 
  not eu , eurozone . 
  and i agree with op , this debt wo n't go away for 200 years at this rate . 
  i am not sure if you are trolling or you just do n't get the point of this thread . 
  middle east is not as simple as turks in turkey , syrians in syria , iraqis in iraq ( last 2 are quite similar ) , persians in iran etc. 
  so anglo french fucked up when they split the countries like that . 
  so you think the kurds in iraq or syria think that saddam or respectivelky assad is `` their dictator '' ? 
  or arabs in iran about the ayatolah ? 
  they are in a similar situation with estonia , just that you are now saying they are somewhat inferior and in europe it could never happen , but estonia lived through that for most of its history , with a small break after wwi and now after 1990 . https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4232063/mid_east_ethnic_lg.png, 
   not our dictators that is exactly the point of this map ... middle east is not ethnically separated in any way , many of them can say it 's not `` our dictator '', 
   if it 's that easy to put dictators and war criminals in power then there must be something seriously wrong with the society your country has been independent for ~ 50 years in total , other than that ruled by dictators ( tzars count as dictators imo ), 
  coming from ex-soviet ... 
  you missed the point, 
  rocket sheeps can definitelly ram each other, 
  there must be discussions regarding ni . 
  it depends how it comes through , if guardian is right and they prepare such a clause during a summit , it is indeed a provocation . 
  eu can be quite a nasty bitch when they want , as shown in their treatment of greece . 
  i did n't mean it like eu had a big active involvemnt . 
  i was saying that by having open borders inside a united europe it made the peace agreement easier . 
  in all fairness , eu with the common customs helped endind the troubles back in ' 98 , not so far ago . 
  i got that wrong then . 
  but this still does n't change my point . 
  eu and its manufacturers wo n't allow an easy cheat for uk , it would be dumb for them . 
  if they allowed canada to do this , they had a reason and surely they made impact analysis . 
  dammit bulgaria , i was sure we will bring this home, 
  dude , that is for canada-eu deals !, 
  meaning that the other part must be done in eu . 
  uk not being in the eu , do n't expect eu car manufacturers to be so stupid to accept a us-uk-eu scheme , why would they ? 
  they will probably turn the screw on uk current manufacturers to have a stricter quota than uk currently produces , forcing some nissan operations to move on the continent . 
  any trade deal eu makes with uk that allows tarriff free entry is going to be very strict against such schemes , why do you think they are so stupid to allow this ? 
  there is the precedent with the cars , where they forced car makers to build factories in eu . 
  you are way off . 
  romania 's relation with urss and then russia was abysmal since the 60s . 
  our securitate went full on against their services . 
  not to mention public support for chechs in 68 , closing ties with americans in the 70s . 
  why do you think russians refused to even sell us parts for the mig29 while doing so for the hungarians ? 
  we could n't maintain them anymore so we had to go back to mig21 which were simpler so our technicians could reverse engineer them and keep them in action . 
  then we had moldova not uniting with us because reasons . . then reasons became clear with transnistrian war . 
  except 1956 , hungary had a much better relation with the russians . 
  even before 1989 they tried there the gulyas communism , trying to raise standards as much as possible . 
  there is absolutele no way romanians will vote for a russian friendly president . 
  you 're delusional , doing this even to unwelcomed subhuman romanians is a sure way of antagonizing the entire eu . 
  eu can for sure tie deals with freedom of movement . 
  did n't you see what i wrote about switzerland and norway ? 
  and individual countries wo n't have an issue with british people . 
   the eu ca n't really walk away without a deal if that means citizens of certain member states being expelled from the uk . 
  what do you mean ? 
   accept 100000 immigrants per year from sudan except uk is not in africa and it 's not sudan . 
  eu does tie immigration to trade deals . 
  switzerland , norway and iceland all allow free movement of people with eu . 
  plus a recent example : eu did force canada to allow visa-free travel for romania and bulgaria together with ceta . 
   beyond the mutual deal may proposes again you fail to see my point . 
  uk can not just propose somethin and expect eu to merely reciprocate . 
  eu is larger and will use its size to muscle in their kind of deal and go from there in the negotiations . 
  it 's like going to a job interview and proclaim from the door that you will only work on wednesdays and fridays , from home and only do accounting . 
  no mate , the job is for 5 days a week , from the office and you will do hr if you want to work with us , we can negotiate on salary and perks though . 
  do you understand what i am saying ? 
  it 's not the junior player that sets out the negotiations . 
  it 's not going to be may who tells trump what she wants from the us , but the other way around . 
  so even if eu leaders agree with may on what she said they will not set off on that footing , they have to take the lead . 
  and while eu leaders are not as charismatic as putin or trump , they are quite powerful as a whole and do tend to work better in the interest of their own citizens . 
  in which country do you trust your government when it can turn your life upside down ? 
  you 're talking bollocks . 
  and anyway , it wo n't be up to may to come up with a deal , cause uk is the smaller party in this negotiation . 
  the eu will come up with something and then may might agree or not . 
  so you would just sit around waiting for a government to make a change ... that could mean your life is turned upside down and potentially you 'll have to move countries ... yeah right . 
   your own territorial integrity not sure if you 're just trolling or what . 
  calling caucasus * russia 's own * is either a lack of history or pure disingenuous . 
  it 's proof they have always been an imperialistic nation during the last centuries , with no pause during the 90s or 2000s, 
  they only wanted in nato to sabotage it , moldova , cecenia , georgia and ukraine are proof . 
  bela lugosi is a hungarian from romania ( he actually took the scrne name lugosi after the city lugoj ) . 
  but vlad the impaler was certainly romanian . 
  it 's more central than eastern . 
  when you talk geography moldova is central and has a continental temperate climate, 
  you have your own brexit ? 
  in romanian it 's you can not have the dick in the ass and the soul in heavens, 
  i think there are more than one group of tatars . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatars#crimean_tatars the crimean ones do seem to originate in the mongol horde invasions as per my link . 
  vlad the impaler ofc , he managed to pull out some successful ottoman resistance https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/night_attack_at_t%c3%a2rgovi%c5%9fte and stefan the great , he somehow managed to always defeat the invaders ( turks , hungarians , polish ) or retreat and regroup without losing the kingdom . 
  he also managed to defeat the mongol remnants ( tatars ) . 
   and eastern european countries that have vastly different levels of border security , anti-terror ability eastern europe does seem more professional on those issues though . 
  no terrorist attacks , refuggees were kept under control sooner etc. 
  this is nice and all . 
  land used 100 % dor good results so it 's ** effective ** . 
  but it is not efficient to have so many little parcels . 
  this is what i would call efficient : https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcqetweogc69ignavtf7cet4hemq6oiytjxlqz7197zh62nxv31usa people always confuse effective with efficient http://www.insightsquared.com/2013/08/effectiveness-vs-efficiency-whats-the-difference/, 
  but that is because of the port , is n't it ? 
  that is not what he argued though . 
  because absolute evil does not exist , so we must be rational and evidence based when making judgements . 
  so far , i brought plenty arguments why military is not unusual in turkey , will have limited ( if any ) influence on the people and in the current climate its mandatory to use them to protect voters from is madness . 
  on the other hand you have erdogan clearly cheating elections with a bad campaign , jailed journalists and stealing ballot papers ( there are videos on youtube ) but not with guns . 
  so why jump the horse and say he used the military to win the referendum ? 
  it 's not necessary to use your assumption to find a reasonable explanation to this whole situation ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/occam%27s_razor ) . 
  the turkish people voted for the populist almost dictator , we find that hard to believe it so we come up with `` erdo stole the elections with the army '' . 
  lots of ifs in your post . 
  turnout was 85 % , higher than 67 % and 73 % in 2007 and 2010 respectively .

also most of udmr 's votes , no matter what their leader dictates , they wo n't vote for ponta . 
  stop confusing gypsies with us , please . 
  :-d true story . 
  i 'm trekking thru the romanian mountains/forests for years and years and i 've never seen one bear . 
  i 've seen bear tracks , and snakes , yeah , but no bears . 
  they are avoiding humans , if possible . 
  robbery ? 
  no way . 
  maybe if you 're getting drunk with some local rednecks , you 'll wake up without your iphone , but that 's about it . 
  :-) ) it is a pretty safe country . 
  it really is . 
  at least here in romania i 've seen all those footages in the news . 
  wtf . 
  what a bunch of crap . 
  this is awesome !, 
  thank you , thank you !, 
  grece does not have ( never had ) the economy to pay those eur1000 pensions , which are bigger than in many other european countries . 
  it 's simple math , in my eyes . 
  it is romanian . 
  got to visit poland sometime soon . 
  the auto industry and its humongous pollution has a way bigger impact on our health than second hand smoking does . 
  and that 's a fact , not some hipster nonsense . 
  go and take a deep breath of air on calea victoriei , you 'll see what i mean . 
  what about the car you drive ? 
  is n't it affecting my civic liberty ? 
  you 're practically killing this planet with all that horrible pollution . 
  that 's ok , right ? 
  who cares , you wo n't be around when it 'll all go down the drain . 
  they found some bigger firecrackers , and some airsoft gear , people . 
  that 's it . 
  yes . 
  there 's no better time . 
  whoa , good stuff so far !, 
  :-) thanks !, 
  romania : strongradio http://www.strongradio.ro/ erdely fm http://tunein.com/radio/erdely-fm-s105823/ tananana http://tananana.ro/, 
  that would be truly horrible . 
  he genuinely has no idea whom erdogan is . 
  whoa , that is so funny . 
  not . 
  here in romania , also . 
  true story . 
  the biggest factor . 
  romania is appealing mainly because you can get away by paying ~ eur 5-700 to your employees , not eur 2-3000 or more in other countries . 
  :-) companies do n't come over here for the cuisine or the beautiful sunsets , let 's face it . 
  well in a sense that we have both mountains and sea . 
  and lots more , geographically speaking . 
  :-) so yeah , for a nature lover , romania has more to offer . 
  but you still have way more tourists , even though romania 's a bit cheaper ( bucharest is an exception - it 's more expensive than budapest ) . 
  the reasons are quite simple : budapest + balaton + better road infrastructure + vecinity to the germanic nations . 
  :-) p.s. 
  ca n't wait to visit budapest again this autumn . 
  i love that city . 
  lol . 
  lots of artists greet the romanian public with `` good evening , budapest ! '' . 
  they make no difference whatsoever between our countries , it 's a fact . 
  :-) we just got ta live with this . 
  our country as a whole is prettier , but budapest is 50 times more awesome than bucharest . 
  true . 
  right . 
  the average leave voter had no idea who schulz is . 
  none . 
  it was a good game , true . 
  i really do n't like this team of ours , maybe that 's why i 'm a bit biased . 
  :-) they 've played nothing so far , we got lucky at the draw , and we must go further . 
  no excuses . 
  sure thing . 
  france played a lousy game , i think that 's the sole reason we played a decent one . 
  :-) we had our chances , but they had theirs too . 
  still , they always had that 5 % extra football in them . 
  in ball control , in passes , in everything . 
  europe desperately needed some black sheep . 
  we won the casting . 
  we 're that good . 
  see ? 
  this confusion is a pretty common one . 
  italy 's rome does n't get associated with romas , but romania does . 
  i have absolutely no problems with them , that 's why i was wondering what 's up . 
  :-) so it 's the same old romanian-roma confusion . 
  that 's sad . 
  why do n't you poles like us , romanians ? 
  maaan , i 've never been there but i love that country . 
  :-) ) had to google that one . 
  wtf , france ? 
  :-) ) ) the place i live in has them ( one romanian , and one eu flag ) on every damn lightpole . 
  my thoughts also . 
  of course it 's not . 
  budapest is pretty awesome too . 
  maaan , i love that city !, 
  the protests are something huge . 
  we could have skipped all the dancing , the singing and flag , that 's all . 
  but hey , that 's just my 5 cents . 
  it 's not just some touristy castle , there are some officials there , the president , i think . 
  i know . 
  true , but we should find common grounds and forget all that primitive racial/ethnic hate . 
  we should focus in a completely different direction . 
  i 'm trying to think as an european , not as a romanian/hungarian/serbian / albanian . 
  i truly believe we are all the same , so we should act like it . 
  jesus christ , get over it already . 
  it 's 2017 . 
  come on .

  i took this summer a tour in hawaii ( great place ! ) . 
  the guide actually thought that russia is still ruled by a tsar . 
  we visited uss missouri . 
  there was a lady which asked why there are so many signatures on the capitulation document ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surrender_of_japan ) . 
  she was surprised that there were other countries fighting in the ww2 `` helping '' the us . 
  in the same tour i met a really smart kid . 
  he knew `` everything '' about european politics ( he majored in political sciences ) so , it seems that is the us , good education is a `` privilege '' that only people which are interested and afford to pay for it get . 
  an older video about this case : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h63_zwpv3uy yes . 
  it 's wrong . 
  but i sure would n't want to live close to them . 
  `` does this mean we should empty the louvre ? '', 
  yes . 
  it 's stolen goods . 
  otherwise you have no rights to complain about nigerian scammers , for example . 
  they are just doing what you used to do . 
  the problem was that germans saw these minorities as a reason for invading other countries . 
  sometimes , safety and politic stability are more important than human rights . 
  good question !, 
  there 's a huge difference . 
  the old moldava province also contained what is today the republic of moldova . 
  you can not claim that people from rep. of moldova are not `` real '' moldavians . 
  greeks say that fyrom has not historical connection with `` real '' macedonians ( and they have sound arguments to back this up ) . 
  i find it strange that romania and moldavia are so far away . 
  it 's basically almost the same culture . 
  also , usually moldavians are more religious . 
  i just do n't see how they can be less traditional than romanians . 
  it just does n't make any sense . 
  `` there is very little mixing between communities , and these immigrant communities basically maintain their own culture , speaking their own language etc. 
  within these enclaves . '', 
  so , basically they are doing exactly what the british used to do when they went to what is today pakistan , bangladesh . 
  i find the historical irony absolutely delicious . 
  how about colonization ? 
  i do n't remember the french , for example , taking african names . 
  or the british , indian names . 
  so the upper comment is correct . 
  multi-culturalism is not new . 
  and also , before the ww2 many european countries were multi-cultural ( e.g. 
  jewish population , germans in czechslovakia and in romania ... ) . 
  even now , some countries are `` traditionally '' multicultural ( belgium , switzerland , finland , some parts of romania ), 
  great !, 
  you 're right about serbia . 
  do n't go there !, 
  visit bosnia instead . 
  sarajevo is beautiful this time of year . 
  `` 1962 : saudi arabia abolishes slavery 1962 : yemen abolishes slavery 1963 : united arab emirates abolishes slavery 1970 : oman abolishes slavery 1981 : mauritania abolishes slavery '' wow . 
  unbelievable . . 
  so there must be many ex-slaves still alive . 
  this would be an interesting ama, 
  who is `` we '' ? 
  not to defend anyone but the airport infrastructure is not meant to handle so much traffic in such a short amount of time . 
  and it does n't have to , since it 's a one time event . 
  thus , some delays are to be expected . 
  i also think it 's stupid to `` claim '' we 're romans . 
  we 're not . 
  just like french are not gauls , english are not angles and modern greeks are not ancient greeks . 
  different times , completely different cultures . 
  i was just arguing on the historical fact without any `` modern '' nationalistic connotations . 
  i agree , there is a lot of nationalistic bullshit . 
  on the other hand , we have always called ourselves `` rom\u00e2ni '' ( or rum\u00e2ni ) ( and thus , rom\u00e2nia ) . 
  the connection is clear . 
  also , the idea that romanians descended from romans is much older the 19th century nation awakening . 
  for example , `` letopisetul cantacuzinesc '' , a document written by stoica ludescu in the 17th century states ( in actually its first sentence ) that ` romanians `` split '' from romans and migrated north ', 
  well . . 
  compared with a chinese they do . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/7756387/uk-child-death-rate-twice-as-high-as-sweden.html while it 's bad , it 's not actually that bad . 
  uk 's rate 0.53 / 100 children . 
  and nobody 's letting children die because they did n't bribe . 
  if you read the article ( and not only the misleading title ) the problem is actually that the hospital is not able to hire doctors . 
  i 'm wondering how did they compute the world average wage . 
  india and china ( countries with huge populations ) have significant bellow that . 
  i agree . 
  schengen is really not that important . 
  the only personal benefit i see is a faster transit time in airports , since usually schenen and non-schengen flights use different terminals . 
  i 'm just wondering what do you think will be the main negative consequences of romania and bulgaria joining the schengen agreement . 
  any romanian or bulgarian who wants to go in the west can do it now without any restriction . 
  you just have to show your id card at the border with hungary . 
  it takes couple of second . 
  schengen has absolutely nothing to do with the right to work or settle . 
  i really do n't get your point . 
  you could also then say then that if the americans from the `` story '' wanted to speak in english in france it 's their personal free choice . 
  so then why judging them ? 
  the questions is if being a jerk with a tourist because ( s ) he tries to speak with you in english is nice/desirable ( or is something that you will do ) . 
  that 's point of the discussion . 
  should every country `` require '' that their tourists try to speak their official language ? 
  is this really feasible ? 
  like it or not , english is `` de facto '' international language . 
  all posts in / r/europe are in english even if german is spoken more is europe as first language . 
  well , for centuries , globalization ( in its early form of colonialism ) benefited exclusivity the european nations so , of course , it was acceptable . 
  the new forms of globalization ( immigration , outsourcing , ... ) start also to benefit the former victims and some negative consequences are felt in the west and thus , they are no longer considered right and normal . 
  yes ... because we all know that when the french went to other countries ( in africa , middle east ) they respected the local way of life , learned the local language and did everything humanely possible to integrate into the local culture . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bojan_aleksandrovi%c4%87 this is the priest who complained about the church issue . 
  articles in serbian newspapers about this problem : http://www.danas.rs/danasrs/drustvo/sloboda_izbora_ili_nametanja_volje.55.html?news_id=235009 http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/aktuelno.290.html:311180-spor-zbog-zvonare-rpc ( i do n't speak serbian . 
  i 've just googled his name and use google translate to try to understand the content of these articles ), 
  well ... 
  the situation was resolved by now ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=01&amp;nav_id=79054 ) i think , on one hand , there is ( or was ) a real problem related to the vlach minority . 
  couple of years ago , some serb church official even consider destroying the only romanian church from the region . 
  on the other hand , i think the `` last '' minute approach also had the point of `` showing the muscles '' . 
  basically the dutch did the same in regards to schengen agreement . 
  there were some technical details which we had to fulfill in order to be accepted . 
  even after they were all fulfilled , netherlands decided to still veto the acceptance to schengen .

  the only sovereign right regarding trade the germany still has is the ability to become full sovereign again . 
  what uk is doing now . 
  why do you think we fought them so hard ? 
  or you can declare war . 
  afaik this is also within international law . 
  awful carpet, 
  there is a huge difference between weapons market and solar panels , batteries and other renewables . 
  things that are taken into consideration when the buyer decides where to buy from have nothing in common between these markets . 
  romania  hungary ? 
  that 's unexpected, 
  why ? 
  you can still have an industry for renewables just that it will be mostly for exports . 
  it will miss the support from internal market so it will start with a handicap but is not like it is banned . 
  should we tell him ? 
  but it is dangerous . 
  to your wallet / s, 
  you misunderstood me then . 
  it was n't a lecture . 
  it was a reasonable estimation of how things could go , the implications if ... , and how it might be perceived . 
  what makes you think that i do n't know ? 
  and what 's your point ? 
  is it illegal to use the same blinking to try to signal a real danger ? 
  the logic is that is better to have people not speeding/talking on the phone always out of fear of getting caught ( if not for doing the right thing ) than people doing this anytime they feel like it because they can get away with it by getting notified in advance if such a danger exists . 
  source ? 
   car from the opposite direction blinking its lights at you i always wondered if this is universal . 
  looks like it is . 
   romania is like ~ ~ 250 ~ ~ 320 euros while it 's ~ ~ 400 ~ ~ 450 in turkey all this while france , belgium , germany ... are at 1400 + . 
  and even this comparison is useless for people who currently do n't have a job , unemployment in turkey is above 12 % ( and probably much higher for youth ) . 
  and like you said turkey `` provides '' noneconomic reasons to emigrate also . 
  not only for kurds , i would imagine secularists do n't feel very good these days also . 
  for many reasons , erdogan being the latest , this scenario is ofcourse hypothetical . 
  but i 'm reasonable sure that turkey would loose at least 10 mil people in next 5 years if tomorrow would be accepted in eu . 
  turkey today is romania today . 
  20 % of romania emigrated in last 10 years . 
  me european ? 
  how would you know without an id ? 
  so , can i get that apartment ? 
  or is it reserved only for ungrateful people ? 
  turks already migrated to germany in the past ( invited ) without a problem . 
  more recently poles did it . 
  romanians , bulgarians did it also . 
  what makes you think that turks wo n't do it in similar proportions ? 
  living standards in romania and turkey are similar ( on average ) . 
  asking eu to choose between 3 mil muslim `` refugees '' and pay a few billion euros + a few small things is one thing . 
  asking eu to choose between 3 mil muslim `` refugees '' and much more than 3 million turks ( out of 80 mil ) , also obviously muslims that will imigrate in western europe is a different thing . 
  that 's the joke, 
  no matter how much you suck you can not become the black sheep of the family . 
   he emigrated to austria [ ... ] austria was annexed , ...  he then emigrated to czechoslovakia . 
  when it was also annexed ... 
  he should have emigrated to moscow after that . 
  lets do it . 
  as long as in the list of countries under russian boot is germany also and you in it ... 
   foreign policy outlooks which is why they form things like the v4 bad example . 
  v4 was formed for what they have in common related to eu ( which is not full `` foreign policy '' anymore ) . 
  on the other hand when it comes to their view in relation to russia ( which is indeed foreign policy ) hungary and poland have little to none in common . 
   criterion 2 : there must be evidence of an intention to coerce , intimidate , or convey some other message to a larger audience ( or audiences ) than the immediate victims . 
  a random gas station with unknown perpetrators . 
  i see no reason why 2nd criteria is true . 
  without any additional evidence i do n't see why this incident is not caused by simply economic/financial reasons related to that particular location . 
  i wonder how many are like [ this ] ( https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/incidentsummary.aspx?gtdid=200804030012 ) . 
  imo this is not a terrorist attack . 
  what if you run a website that shows best places where you can buy drugs ? 
  ( this would be the correct analogy of a torrent tracker ), 
  the good thing for you is that you do n't have anything to lose ( territorywise ) . 
  taking land from hungary means taking hungarians as well . 
  no thanks , we have enough headache with the hungarians that we have now . 
  on a second thought will just ban gulas and k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs in hungary if you loose , so do n't play with fire . 
  look at the bright side . 
  less money for funding mosques , ideology push ( in europe and everywhere ) . 
  now if could just stop buying that oil ... 
   my position here has always been , no state money to build churches , i share the same opinion on mosques . 
  same position . 
  also about taxes and paying part of priest 's / imam 's ... salary . 
  ( btw fuckers in parliament just introduced new tax exempts for religious purposes ) . 
  but if we have to choose between romania funding the mosque or turkey doing so ... , i choose romania ( lesser evil ), 
  soviets took moldova through a 72 hours ultimatum . 
  hitler needed our oil , he would have come for it anyway . 
  hungary wanted a piece of us . 
  so ... no , it was n't an option . 
  we did n't have that luxury . 
  i would like romania to fund that mosque , not turkey . 
  and it would be better if it was placed in constanta , that is true . 
  otoh you kinda need a mosque in bucharest also , just a smaller one . 
  that is if we do n't take literally that `` no mosque north of danube thing '', 
   turkish mosques are by far the best in the entirety of europe . 
  not comparable in numbers but our mosques ( turkish-tatar minority ) are also in europe . 
  and i do n't think there is anything to complain about them . 
   could start having conversations with other people but can you ? 
  in `` natural '' environment ? 
  or you 're counting `` artificial '' environment for that language as conversation also ? 
   according to the dublin agreements . 
  if this would be of any practical value they would n't be in germany in the first place . 
  that mandate is more of a bs that this rape accusation, 
  and the prosecutor `` investigating '' this for so many years without producing evidence and despite the allegedly `` victims 's '' testimony that crime did n't happen is what ? 
  pinnacle of justice ? 
   permafrost melts afaik permafrost literally translates as `` permanently frozen '' . 
  maybe they designed this facility on an entirely false premise . 
  does n't fraud implies intent ? 
  military should care about practicality of a choice , not how it looks from political pov . 
  i wonder how is this porn censorhip seen in scotland .

  rain rain and more rain , every time i talk to her we talk about rain : /, 
  how 's the snow around your stuck car ? 
  i 'm not joking . 
  ** what ** ?!? 
  i 'll do anything for that :'(, 
  now i see , even saturday ?!? 
  yeah , the minimum here will be -22 , saturday : / . 
  thank you god , i appreciate it very much . . not :(, 
  all my childhood i was afraid by the `` goat ! '', 
  is the russians fault anyway , and finns , since this c. . py weather come from there !!!, 
  damn them !, 
  you lucky bastarts , we had -28 last night and the worse is still to come : '' ( i want summer !!!, 
  please god !, 
  depends what you like , i do n't like red wine ... put me down like nothing else  try tokaj !, 
  get real people !!, 
  i do n't know about that , but i can send . 
  must talk to my dad though : /, 
  tur\u021b , you can bet your self on it  i hate it !, 
  you must focus on something and from nowhere came a romanian word , it 's hard even for me : /, 
  you need p\u00e1link\u00e1 ?!, 
  our is stronger than anything else !, 
  really !, 
  you can set a huge condominium in fire with it : /, 
  yes , that 's from greece to czech and ukraine !, 
  we mingled eachother like crazy back in the days !, 
  edit : what 's wrong , a little , with your assumption is that aromanian is a dialect of romanian . 
  it 's my opinion that it is a different language , which i do n't understand . 
  my opinion . 
  edit 2 : of course , we did n't even touch eachother !, 
  heavy ment red , very red : / for the winter is , boiled red-ish wine with cinnamon and sugar . 
  if you want ** heavy ** we have something else , plum brandy 80 \u00b0 at least !, 
  i have wine , much too heavy and dry for my taste though . 
  my mum has her stash of wine , for her friends and our grannies , made with honey . 
  delicious , 
  keep him !, 
  in like seven countries even , beat that , 
  oh god , you did n't . . !, 
  it 's more like condolences : / it 's -19 on a car thermometer now , i 'm not sure how reliable it is tho . 
  gulf stream has almost nothing to do with our climate , we 're far too east , meddi5e . 
  scandinavia is way warmer than russian steppe . 
  i 've seen on telly two days ago that on the mountains the temp feel was -69 . 
  i know it was because of the wind . . but really now , here was -10 !, 
  where 's that lovely may : '' (, 
  cs\u00e1ng\u00f3 's are the `` worse '' for those who do n't know romanian and even for those who know it , cuz they use lots of romanian words as `` spital '' and `` ma\u0219in\u0103 '' , the rural folks who never attend a class of magyar that is . 
  edit : that 's a hearsay though , i never was there , so do n't put to much credence to it , 
  like you did n't know we have those kind of temperatures ? 
  i think you forget how north europe is in fact and that we , very unfortunately , are located quite close to the russian/ukrainian steppe  it 's colder here than in most of we and even parts of ne , f. . kin continental climate :'(, 
  oh , would be a dream come true !, 
  i want some green grass ( not on the table since i 'm not a cow . . physically at least ) !!!, 
  unusual ?!? 
  ( 0 . o ) i remember few years ago the snow was almost to our windows . 
  well , the morning is the colder ( not sure if it 's the right way to say it ) part of the . . night . 
  i absolutely hate the winter , with passion !, 
  except the last half of december of course , 
  yeah , you try to be a 18yo girl with two bro 's and share the bathroom with them  edit : to not that . 
  in the daytime ?!?!, 
  looks like we 'll have up ( or should i say down ? ), 
  till -25 in the next two nights , fortunately not where i live . . 
  thank goodness lol, 
  not really , we 're a family of five and i 'm the only girl ( with two idiots as bigger brothers ) . 
  the third bathroom was built only four years ago when my father extend the house ( to my relief and joy ) . 
  nah , you kinda spoke from . . your toilet . 
  i live in the countryside and we have three indoor toilets . 
  thank you !, 
  i 've learned something new . 
  man , you really have some . . 
  dialects !!!, 
  wow !, 
  indeed !, 
  what 's there in ne ? 
  only german speaking people or . . ? 
  that 's insane !, 
  my friends live here , so i do n't have a good insight into urban turkish youth , unfortunately . 
  oh , ex-girlfriend ... hmmm , now depends on how you broke up / s : ^ ), 
  well , from what i see and what i 've heard from some turkish friends , he 's an idiot . 
  he likes power and that is n't very good for his country , he may not be stupid but the way he leads turkey is idiotic ... so he 's an idiot . 
  more or less idiot then , from our pov , 
  my first thought was `` blackmail , that wo n't get you anywhere turkey '' . 
  but , more or less , he 's kinda right even if we do n't like it . 
  they are overwhelmed by those people , lebanon too , plus the problems with the kurds and all those suicide attacks and the cherry on top they have an idiot as president . 
  i wonder what any of us will think about this situation if we were in their shoes . 
  edit : they not their, 
  oh , well it 's still funny ... especially since i understand what he was into  thanks , really !, 
  really ?!, 
  well , i 'm not very well versed in this but she seems to do her job . 
  of course i may be wrong . 
  those were canadians fortunately . . or unfortunately , 
  does n't look very appealing these days , with all the snow and freezing cold but at least it 's better than in the southern counties . 
  i like you better , at least you know us !, 
  we are , but we still profit !, 
  who 's he  ? 
  now i look at snow !, 
  so you think we better keep it there ? 
  why not have it ? 
  but tourists may or not come , while that thing is there for sure !, 
  damn , that 's nothing mr mod , we only have a friendly talk  could you tell to my friend , who erased my/his comments , please , 
  you 're red after those three days of pain ?!, 
  your brother does a portuguese skin only cos he can tan ?!, 
  swedes can tan my american friend !, 
  i know how it is , i live in this environment and i 'm sick of what i 've seen until now .

  i still like you , britbros . 
  take care of those sharia lunatics while you 're gone , ey ? 
   edit : i did n't mention portugal . 
  we love you too .

  if you believe in the leadership training i went to ( which is probably similar to any of its kind in the world ) you raise opinion and give positive feedback at least 4 times as much as any criticism posted .

  i 'm not playing the blame game but i am personally wondering what the hell the french security forces were doing in light of the terrorist threats surrounding the euro champ . 
  they mobilized the army in paris to prevent guys with real deadly weapons , surely they should handle some hooligans easily ? 
  do n't worry , historically our * closest * has been france but we 're good friends with serbs , poles , murica , germany for various reasons . 
  what if swe decides to put a turban over their ball ? 
  it 's simple , really . 
  they are the same thing in concept but differ in execution . 
  both regime types are capable of and have displayed plenty of times their ruthlessness and greed . 
  the key difference is that because of multiple actors vying to hold the same chunk of power , it gets divided so they never quite go all the way except for when interests align . 
  for the sake of what you responded toward : you can put an equal sign between western democratic behaviour of aligned interests and ghadaffi 's rule . 
  what i said from the start is just that : they are fully capable of displaying dictatorship-style abuse and have done it plenty of times . 
  what you responded toward was a concrete equal sign between the two , disregarding my nuance . 
  i 'm fully aware of the difference between the two but my point was to highlight that we 're not living under heaven here and tone down the generally demonizing circlejerk discussion as it so often happens when talking about oh those evil dictatorships and our pure valiant regimes . 
   but truth is you could be jailed and tortured for being a political opponent because that never happened to us citizens . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_blair_mountain https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kent_state_shootings, 
  no , i was n't arguing that exact thing you just wrote . 
   tortured people he didnt like , rewarded those who did his bidding ... he was literally a archatypcal dictator i 'm sure western democracies never do anything of the sort , right ? 
  what is this crap that dictators are ruthless and evil and democratically elected governments can do no harm at all for the sake of power ? 
  all you 're declaring is you prefer a mob to rule over you than one figurehead . 
  you know very well what he meant : a population which fights back is one that still has the desire to live and affirm its existence . 
  right now , it does n't seem to be the case . 
  technically nobody wants bloodshed but if the political measures being pushed for will come to pass , it will be all but inevitable as the social cohesion that binds the nations of europe collapses under the strain of foreign usurpation . 
  nobody can argue or change the fact that the vast majority of immigrants have violent , uneducated mentalities and do n't care for any kind of european integration . 
   who will decide what is stupid or misleading ? 
  who cares ? 
  just gather signatures . 
  is n't that what democracies do to even trigger a referendum if enough people feel like having one ? 
   every time someone famous will disagree with results , we will make new referendum ? 
  if they manage to gather enough support , should n't you ? 
   making new referendum now , would only create precedent , where you should make new referendum every single day because someone might vote without full understanding of consequences . 
  do you honestly believe that is a * realistic * supposition of events ? 
  come now , you know humans better than that : they will hold referendums when pressing and urgent national defining matters are being discussed and more than once or twice in a few years they wo n't bother with it . 
  if anything the biggest `` worry '' is that you 'll have an informed and engaged population and the rich and powerful surely would n't want that . 
   then again , who will dedice , that next referendum is the final referendum and nobody else can question it ? 
  the eventual apathy of the population . 
  this is exactly how laws keep changing - albeit with more participation . 
  you can not have a permanent decision behind the way you take care of your country . 
  if status quo changes , the country must adapt . 
   when you signing some contract about xxx , do you read the paper or you just sign it without reading it ( just because someone told you xxx its a great deal ) if you do happen to get suckered in by said contract - let 's say even a marriage proposal - and it turns sour , should n't you have the option to bail out in a way that does n't ruin your life ? 
  that 's why divorce , bankrupcy , abortion and other methods exist because to live is to adapt and change while stagnation and immobility breeds in weakness and death . 
  my argument is one i 'm fully prepared to support so please if you do try again to attack it come with much , much better arguments than that . 
   you cant make new just because people are stupid and believe in everything . 
  why not ? 
  no , really . 
  you never made any decision in your life that did differently in the end because it turned out to be stupid/misleading ? 
  why should an entire population not afford to ? 
  more dodging and avoiding the point . 
  here 's your reply . 
   what has that to do with what i said ? 
  because it attacks the core of your `` okay to start an offensive war '' argument by highlighting there is no such thing as `` okay '' in the first place . 
  rest of your reply is you dodging that very fact and pretending it did n't occur or was n't relevant when it was basically everything you argued for . 
   the premise that it 's okay to start an offensive war to make a country conform to our ethical standards because financial gains is a ok .  why would we take offense on north korea doing the same , or , for that matter , the state of is doing the same to other states ? 
  because geopolitical interests trigger wars , not `` offense '' . 
  can you honestly claim any war in the past 50 years had any kind of legitimacy/no one should be offended by them ? 
  do you honestly believe the `` ethical standards '' of helping the people subjugated to fascism was n't the key component to dragging countries like the us into world war 2 ? 
  do you really think the us was only involved in ww2 after pearl harbour ? 
  war in real life is more than just the declaration and conquest . 
  oh no doubt israel has capable leadership . 
   azerbaijan has no antisemitism , contrary to armenia you can see how recognizing their suffering would greatly alleviate that problem . 
   even if it is moraly right , in the end it would hurt x more than anything . 
  i 'm sure there are plenty of ( neo ) nazis who felt ( feel ) the same way . 
  i was just highlighting the irony because i felt it deserved to be . 
   why do governments insist on apologizing for extremism and allowing it to run rampant . 
  if this was a neo-nazi organization it would rightfully be shut down in its infancy but because it 's a religion it gets carte blanche to preach hate ? 
  hubris , essentially . 
  saudi arabia is the dog the western countries use to conduct shady arms deals , money laundering and oil prices . 
  they also use them in a mutual exchange of power to ensure both the spread of wahabist islamic ideology and the slow restriction of freedoms in the western world . 
  if the status quo were not as imperative to the leaders , they would well be on their way to ridding themselves of them in favor of more malleable leaders .

  but , again , we do n't know how twitter and facebook handle these things nor how they will handle them in the future . 
   because reddit so far has not been under the threat of fines that are millions of euros per comment . 
  first of all , neither are facebook and twitter . 
  these laws are just being proposed and discussed . 
  there is no `` threat of fines '' . 
  yet reddit does ok while twitter and facebook fail at it . 
  secondly , those fines apply only for `` the individual employee responsible for the complaint procedure '' . 
  nowhere in the article does it say that they will get fined for each mishandled report . 
  that 's a false assumption on your part . 
  read the article . 
   i feel sorry for you if you truly think these are `` conspiracy theories '' . 
  i truly do . 
  you provided no arguments besides conspiracy theories and zero facts to uphold them . 
  here 's a fun fact . 
  present day germany fares very well in regards to respecting basic human rights and that includes freedom of the press . 
  it does way better than the us . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_freedom_indices#list_by_country ) sort the list by `` press freedom index '' or any other index . 
  germany is 7th while the us is 29th , right behind taiwan and just after barbados . 
  the uk is 28th . 
  these are figures from 2016 . 
  ** and that 's a fact . 
  ** feel free to spout more conspiracy theories . 
   how am i discriminating against someone for simply hating them ? 
  because your `` only reason for disliking this man is his religion '' . 
  you 've said that yourself . 
  you then said `` i also dislike anyone that shares his religion and would wish they all got a heart attack today . '', 
  and then `` kill all < insert religion/gender/race  '' that 's religious discrimination and incitement to violence . 
   erdo\u011fan , the president of turkey , considers it his human right not to be insulted did you literally chose a dictator wannabe to preach about human rights ? 
  he also only applies those laws to protect himself from insults . 
  that violates the basic human rights that all men are born equal . 
  turkey is a de facto dictatorship . 
  what 's next ? 
  you 're going to tell me how north korea handles human rights ? 
  these are not democratic states . 
  they do not respect human rights . 
  their opinion on the matter is irrelevant . 
  turkey committed the armenian genocide and you 're using erdogan to preach human rights ? 
  really ? 
   by posting hateful comments about a religion i am not impeding someone from practicing their religion . 
  dude , you literally said `` kill all < insert religion/gender/race  '' . 
   `` i think all creationists are stupid '' not hate speech . 
  discriminatory in the sense that it 's wrong because it generalizes , but it 's not illegal . 
   `` i think all christians are stupid '' the same . 
   `` i think all christian creationists are stupid '' the same . 
  ** insults are not the same as hate speech . 
  ** if you constantly insult specific people or specific groups of people , regardless of your motives , you can be charged for harassment . 
  but they would have to register a complaint or your harassment has to be persistent and hateful for these messages to get taken down by a service provider like reddit or twitter . 
  this already happens . 
  milo yiannopoulos got banned from twitter for something similar . 
  he 'd been harassing and promoting hate speech for years before that happened . 
  besides far right extremists like himself , nobody batted an eye when he got banned . 
  the point is to have these actions taken more swiftly and to prevent them in the future . 
   what about political ideas ? 
  `` i think all mras/feminists/alt right should drop dead right now '' obvious hate speech . 
  why ? 
  because of the `` drop dead '' part . 
  if it were `` stupid '' instead , it would have been ok as long as it was n't perpetual as in harassment . 
   where do you draw the line , personally ? 
  i always think about basic human rights . 
  i ask myself : would these actions limit the free expression of basic human rights for this person or group of people ? 
  if the answer is yes , then the line has been crossed . 
  the problem here is that these are laws being proposed by a government which has history with abuse . 
  nazis abused human rights . 
  the universal declaration of human rights was drafted and signed after world war 2 ended . 
  ** people never get outraged when reddit removes hate speech or even insults . 
  ** ** people only get outraged when governments do it . 
  ** that 's a double standard and it 's wrong . 
  present day germany fares very well in regards to respecting basic human rights . 
  it does way better than the us .

   i 'm legitimately baffled how you can ignore the fact that such a system has n't worked anywhere from a technical standpoint . 
  what system are you talking about ? 
  there is no system yet . 
  the laws have just been proposed . 
  the system has yet to be created . 
   this just tells me the minister has no understanding of how the sites work . 
  he did n't compare the systems , he compared their performance . 
   twitter fared even worse , with only 1 percent of content reported by users deleted ( no change on last year 's test ) , while youtube showed a massive improvement - a 90-percent deletion rate compared to only 10 percent last august . 
  the of this is to show that twitter and facebook are doing nothing to prevent threats and hate speech . 
   but actually convincing a court that certain comments posted online are hate speech is a much much higher hurdle reddit removes death threats and hate speech comments and posts without involving a court . 
  if you were to threaten me right now , i would report you and your comment would be deleted . 
  you 'd probably also get banned . 
  reddit does this by it 's own volition . 
  these new laws want to mandate similar behaviors on twitter and facebook . 
   of course that company is going to be trigger happy with the deletions this is a huge assumption on your part . 
  reddit has been doing this for ages without being trigger happy . 
   to me this entire thing looks more like a way to hurt foreign companies so that local german alternatives can get a bigger market share . 
  you literally have no arguments besides crazy conspiracy theories . 
  this discussion is over . 
   hundreds of `` death threats '' every single day are about as credible as that viagra spam . 
  if you do n't believe people receive death threats , then you 're being severely ignorant .

  the idea is to allow people to report them as they appear . 
  other people can report hate speech and threats about other people . 
  you do n't have to do it yourself . 
  you 're being intentionally obtuse and you 're ignoring how things work .

  you do n't need to kill millions of people like the allies did in ww2 with `` carpet bombing '' . 
  / u/anarchisto taking the dominant personality trait of every candidate and trying to predict what the us will do is too simplistic . 
  such decisions are not made unilaterally by the president or `` commander in chief '' ; every nation has a small army of analysts in the department of defense who * strongly influence * political decisions so in fact there is a continuation of foreign policy based on various constraints irrespective of who the new president is and what his personality is . 
  that might be too ahead of its ' time for our leaders :p, 
  yes , but that new money should go into infrastructure investment ; which we desperately need in the east ... the solution to higher consumption in europe is here , but it 's a political decision . 
  edit : europe could do so much to raise internal consumption ... build a military , invest in eastern europe , invest in space exploration , litter the south with solar panels and hydro-battery dams in the mountains which are filled during the day ... on and on ... but junckers ' plan is getting underway too slowly and it 's a bit aimless imo . 
  russia had to sell lukoil gas stations in the baltic states and poland because nobody was buying gas from them anymore . 
  whichever country uses nukes , is going to experience that , globally . 
  the moment any country uses offensive nukes is the moment every person in the world starts checking product labels to avoid buying their products . 
  how do you imagine any country in the world could use nukes offensively without causing unimaginable public outcry ? 
  are you sane ? 
  * `` we need a stable euro '' , `` we need a stable euro '' , `` we need a stable euro '' * ... that 's what people at the top say to assure investors and they announce devaluation way ahead of time for this very reason . 
  that does n't change the fact that everyone tries to price their currency at an ideal level for economic growth . 
  nearly every single region in the world , with the exception of the us is slowing down economically . 
  russia , china , opec , south america , etc. 
  this weakens their currencies so they are able to buy less which in turn affects the exports of europe . 
  a weaker euro would alleviate some of the problems that countries like germany are about to have , so they can continue to export , continue to produce and keep themselves from a very bad unemployment problem . 
  it is true that a weaker currency makes us poorer when we import goods which are not manufactured here , particularly raw materials which we use to manufacture goods , but i do n't see that we have a choice . 
  and even then , germany will probably have a serious exports problem because it is not possible to devalue the euro to match how weak other currencies are getting . 
  some people attribute the notions of `` strong '' and `` weak '' to a currency thinking that strong is always good and weak is always bad , but that 's not really the case . 
  there is an ideal balance for each currency which most favors economic growth based on what that country exports and imports so it 's different for everyone and it changes over time . 
  ideally an intelligent move would be to allow a strong euro while we stack up and fill our deposits of raw materials then weaken it enough that our exports are kept at decent levels . 
  moreover a weaker euro will help southern europe recover faster . 
  there , happy ? 
  : p edit : of course you ca n't play around with the currency too much or investors lose confidence ... so it 's a really a complicated decision-making process . 
   fuck off not much incentive for me to explain anything after that . 
  you do n't understand basic economics . 
  we need a weaker euro . 
  what ? 
  turkey 's got some balls . 
  first it burns bridges with russia then threatens the us as if it had plenty of other allies ... turkey will lead another ottoman-like empire of influence in the region . 
  george friedman was right about turkey . 
  nobody is using nukes offensively ... calm down . 
  and nobody is using nukes to defend the baltics or romania or poland ... 
  the first country to kill people with nukes is going to have a crippling economy crisis . 
  calm down ; nobody is using nukes . 
  lol, 
   we are talking total war in europe . 
  nukes will drop then . 
  economies will lie in shambles . 
  nooo , we do n't wage war like we used to . 
  the allies committed an unimaginable act carpet-bombing german cities to complete destruction . 
  we 've got much more precision in war now . 
  plus , russia is not capable of what you 're talking about , but it is capable of annexing territories to break nato apart . 
   where do you want to project power and why ? 
  north africa and the middle east so they all calm the fuck down . 
  oh but btw , once nukes are obsolete , war is coming back , big-time . 
  but with far fewer casualties since weapons are far more precise and automation will replace humans in tanks , planes , drones , etc. 
  edit : but , the smaller the risk for loss of human life , the more prone countries will be to use force to solve their problems . 
  no it 's not , it 's right there . 
  nobody is ever going to use nukes again . 
  there is a window of 20-30 years at the most until nukes become obsolete as lasers can shoot missiles down before they reach any target . 
  until then , there is still sufficient outcry against nukes that any country who used them would be economically boycotted and shunned . 
  so really , they are almost useless now , and soon to be irrelevant . 
   yes but you do n't need a giant military for that , if the goal is to defend and not to project power . 
  and this is where we disagree . 
  we need to project power , at least in our immediate neighborhood . 
  without an army and without troops in the region , what happened to crimea could happen to moldova , or somewhere in the baltic region . 
  and before you can react you 're in a situation where the territory is already occupied and now more troops and a bigger commitment are required to re-take it , than you 're willing to invest . 
  so you hesitate , try to negotiate , talks are dragged on for months until the initial drive and emotion to defend anything is lost . 
  then what ? 
  sometimes you militarize precisely so you do n't * have * to fight a war . 
   i also do n't see how ee distancing itself from its allies in the west is good for their security . 
  allies in the west are n't forthcoming anyway . 
  you would n't fight russia or turkey alongside us if push came to shove . 
   also would you really have preferred if germany had used force to push policies down peoples throats ? 
  germany ? 
  use force ? 
  how would that work exactly ? 
  ** edit : ** but look , this alliance of the 3 seas , is in fact an alliance against 3 empires . 
  it 's called the intermarium but in fact what we 're most concerned with is that there are always 3 empires , west , south and east , historically always crushing us with some regularity ; which is what prevented our development to begin with . 
  germany is an economical empire but frankly i 'm worried about france ... as it could easily : 1 . 
  side with putin if fn wins , since fn is funded by the kremlin ( but i do n't blame the french for voting fn , mainstream political parties have failed to address the imigration and non-integration , non-assimilation problems ) . 
  eventually become a muslim majority country , a nuclear power and imperialistic again , siding with turkey in the south . 
  see , long-term we have serious concerns . 
  what war in europe ? 
  what are you talking about ?

we 're ok . 
  there 's no way to get to germany from romania . 
  my problem is with generalization . 
  we are 21mil people out of which maybe 10-20 % are working abroad or have worked abroad . 
  the rest of us are quite content to live and work in our country and most of the time we do not condone immigrants whether they are of our nationality or from other countries ( there 's a lot of making fun of people going to other countries to pick strawberries or olives or to wipe old people 's asses ) . 
  i do n't want or need to come to any western country to earn a good living . 
  i live pretty well here . 
  i only come to your countries to spend money as a tourist . 
  i also do n't want migrants from my country to come to your country and make a bad name for me and my compatriots . 
  on top of that , i think that when someone moves to a foreign country he/she should adopt the country 's culture and sever his/her ties to her own culture . 
  you are a guest for fuck 's sake . 
  do n't ruin the country that welcomed you . 
  i really do n't understand why europe has to take any refugees . 
  we can put them on ferries and ship them back to syria . 
  in no time no refugee will want to come to europe . 
  go czech republic !, 
  the roads around sofia seemed way better this year than two years ago . 
  just give it a few years . 
  they 'll remember that the pipes had to be changed and they 'll drill all that new asphalt . 
  then the repairs will be very shoddy and after the first winter everything will look bombarded . 
  then the city or the eu will pay for a new layer of asphalt and just as it 's finished they 'll remember that they forgot some electric cables and the cycle will start all over again . 
  wtf , where is this ? 
  after a lifetime of bad experiences with a lot of different gypsies ( some of them violent ) i have no desire to waste time on them . 
  they 're not asking for help , they are happy to live out their lives as parasites at the outskirts of modern society . 
  they also do n't want to be educated or respect the law - both major requisites of the world we live in . 
   tolerance , empathy and solidarity are also modern and progressive values but i do n't see you holding them very dear . 
  i have plenty of tolerance , empathy and solidarity for people who do n't want to hurt me or the society i live in . 
  it 's a group of people that share a set of values , customs and traditions that are not compatible with modern values and with progress in general . 
  race is of no consequence . 
  race has nothing to do with it . 
  it 's their middle ages culture that 's the problem . 
  considering that they 're multiplying like animals , i might just be a minority soon . 
  life 's too short and complicated to solve other people 's problems . 
  yup , that 's the stuff . 
  it is hardly my problem . 
  i do n't feel it 's my responsibility to hand-hold them into the 21st century . 
  they 're no different than some poor romanians that manage to go to college and make a life for themselves in spite of their modest origins . 
  sometimes it might even be easier for the gypsies since they have some state sponsored university places . 
  * shitty architecture ( check ) * curse words and corruption ( nope , we had that already ) * vodka ( nope , we drink mostly beer , homemade wine and homemade spirits ) and on top of that : * we lost some territories * they pillaged and raped everything on their way to germany in ww2 * they transformed us from a blooming country to a country of underdeveloped , bitter people - hopefully we 're recovering from that * they killed most of our elites and turned our values upside-down i will never forget and forgive what the russian people did to us . 
  come in july or august next time . 
  it 's decent . 
  in the autumn and winter it 's awful . 
  in the spring it 's somewhat bearable . 
   a lot of soviet union blocks , but as someone who lives in ex-su country we have them too so it was n't bad . 
  yeah , that sucks . 
  the communists destroyed a big chunk of our beautiful city . 
  take this area of the city for example - [ before ] ( https://www.facebook.com/uranusdisparut/photos_stream?ref=page_internal ) and [ after ] ( http://storage0.dms.mpinteractiv.ro/media/401/321/5106/13114003/15/6169149-mediafax-foto-toni-salabasev.jpg ) . 
  we have one that is made [ entirely of eggplants ] ( http://www.lilisor.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/lactobar-retro-bistro34.jpg ) . 
  it works very well with fine chopped fresh red onions and fresh thinly sliced tomatoes . 
  also , i just remembered , there 's a variety of zacusca that includes baked hot peppers . 
  it 's much better than the classic one . 
  all in all , we share a lot of dishes with the bulgarians , greeks and turks with small tweaks here and there . 
  it shows that we developed in the same area . 
   it 's definitely not something you 'd have for breakfast we spread it on toast and eat it for breakfast , as a snack or as an appetizer . 
  i 've looked up the ingredients for the zacusca from the linked image and they 're : baked eggplants , baked peppers , white onions , tomato juice ( pure of boiled tomatoes is more accurate , i think ) , sunflower oil and salt . 
  i think they 're all mixed together and boiled . 
  the parsley and the red onion from the picture are just decorative . 
  it what region of bulgaria would one find kiopoolu ? 
  we ca n't hold them for much longer . 
  sorry for your experience . 
  it 's likely that the witness was a friend of the offending driver and he did n't even see the accident . 
  if the driver would had been found guilty he would have had to pay for his car 's repairs out of his pocket , he would have had his license suspended for one to three months and would have paid a hefty fine . 
  so that was his motivation to be an asshole and lie . 
  i hope the next time he does it he lands in a ditch or something . 
  i really hate this kind of people , but i imagine that there are douchebags everywhere . 
  the police are very obtuse when it comes to accidents . 
  they see the facts that are presented to them and make a decision based on the law and the least amount of effort required of them . 
  it has nothing to do with the fact that you were a foreigner . 
  maybe the camera was working but it required some phone calls or some crazy bureaucratic gymnastics , but it 's quite as likely that it did n't work . 
  i 've recently read that bucure\u0219ti has a state of the art traffic monitoring system that no one knows how to operate . 
  so , go figure ... 
   are you also afraid to be confused with romans , the citizens of rome ? 
  that 's the etymology of the name : roma-nia . 
  people in the 19th century thought it would be cool if everybody knew we were of latin descent . 
  stupid idea , i know . 
  there are lots of rroma in romania and there 's an unfortunate similarity in the names . 
  fuck our self-loathing attitude . 
  well , i 'm not so sure it 's 100 % our merit . 
  i think the eu and/or the usa are behind all this . 
  they need a rock solid country with uncompromisable leaders at the eastern border so that russia can have less influence . 
   the reason we 're all thinking about leaving is because the prospects here ... are shit . 
  i 'm quite happy in romania and i have great prospects . 
  calif is where it 's at . 
   romania does n't get appreciation from the romanians themselves , you can even see that from the comments i have a theory about this . 
  i think it has to do with the fact that during the communist period , at school we were taught that romania is the best fucking country in the whole world - it had huge mountains , beautiful seashore , fertile plains , picturesque hills , one of the best industries and so on . 
  meanwhile people were queuing for 12 hours to buy some milk and some bread . 
  after the regime change , the romanians got to see that there were other places that were as ( or more ) beautiful and that other countries had better economies and a better standard of living . 
  also , in the early 90s people were barely making a living as the economy collapsed and had to be rebuilt from scratch . 
  so , people probably felt betrayed and lied to and reacted by talking shit about romania and refusing to acknowledge even its positives . 
  i think that perception is slowly changing and the younger generations see romania for what it is - a country among others with it 's qualities and problems - not the best and not the worst . 
  [ transalpina ] ( http://www.transalpina.biz/poze.html ) is also worth a visit . 
  personally , i like it more . 
  we do love the moldovans , they just have a russian infestation problem . 
  if they 'll just throw the russians over the border we 'll welcome them with open arms . 
  it seems that a lot of foreigners like bucharest . 
  i think it 's more about the atmosphere than the architecture , the cleanliness and the monuments . 
  come to think of it , bucharest is a pretty lively city that barely sleeps . 
  it 's a very unfortunate coincidence . 
  to my knowledge `` romani '' comes from the gypsy word `` rom '' , which means `` man '' . 
  meanwhile the name `` romania '' comes from `` roma '' - as in rome , italy .

  there are also some who came due to having a husband or wife from here . 
  there is a group who comes and buys property in scenic landscapes , usually older folks . 
  same in romania . 
  we have our fair share of italians , spaniards , french and others . . 
  stereotypes most probably coupled with lack of contact . 
  gypsies have a lot of hustles . 
  selling magazines is rare . 
  the most common poster hustle ( the ones lots of people notice ) right now in bucharest is parking help . 
  bucharest has a big parking spaces problem and in central areas gypsies ( and not only gypsies ) will guide to a free parking spot which they spot waiting in the street and demand money as if it 's theirs to rent . 
  another one is selling flowers or chinese crap at stops . . 
  there are some eerily beautiful villages in transilvania that seem stuck in time . 
  if you are into that and into mountains you wo n't be disappointed . 
  do n't miss brasov , sibiu and sighisoara . . 
  what are you into ? 
  add that to a lot of shit concerning the danube border at the black sea and the whole serpent island affair . . 
  so . . rich europe and poor europe . . 
  we got to anschluss moldova first !, 
  i guess you 're right . 
  no one really hates you , but there are a lot of people that dislike some facets of swiss cultures , cough cough , the banking sector . . 
  umm , are you sure ? 
  i trust him . 
  he is also one of the greats . 
  nooo !, 
  damn i loved that woman . 
  we have a lost a genius . 
  i hope that her studio can continue her legacy and continue to make our cities more beautiful . . 
  i would argue renault is a bit better than peugeot . 
  peugeot is renowned for reliability issues here too . . 
  gps and computers so they can follow a laid out track without the need of a driver for example . 
  air conditioning . 
  etc, 
  putin has yachts the size of airports . . 
  syria is way way more fucked than iraq already . . 
  yeah , good luck with that . . 
  you obviously have no idea of the capabilities of european states militaries . . and overestimate the russians, 
  mate , if the wars today are fought with sophisticated weapons technology and tactical planing allow me to reinforce my belief that europe is well placed to build such things and think of the best ways to deploy them . 
  i also think experience from ww2 is still actual concerning the type of warfare waged in the middle east . 
  that 's where you 're wrong ... 
  let me stop you right there . 
  there is an actor that uses terrorism against europe with the help of infiltrators and traitors . 
  stopping terrorism for good of course is untenable but greatly reducing the frequency by liquidating the actor that uses this technique of warfare against you is very much in the realm of the possible . 
  the hard question is , would you be willing to see your country loose a few percent of its gdp for several years to finance the liquidation of said actor ? 
  all this talk about europe being weak . 
  i pity the ones targeted by an europe committed to wage war . 
  these countries are built on nothing but carnage , war , genocide and violence on an industrial scale and on a global theater . 
  they have extensive experience in it . 
  terrorism is a form of warfare too so the name is irrelevant . 
  as the answer to it so far . . 
  maybe it would have been more devastating . 
  more locations , more people . 
  which means that there is a real possibility the cell is bigger and we have more of them alive and on the loose . . 
  yeah ? 
  i can make predictions too . . 
  here 's one . 
  there will be new attacks in europe !, 
  i think they 're not much different than others in eastern europe . 
  excellent answer . 
  hats off . . 
  i have no idea how in the fuck we ended up saying da while ukrainians are saying tak . . 
  i guess the eastern european immigrants witch hunt has left some marks . . 
  what 's the average family size in the uk ? 
  950000 jobs means 950000 families . 
  this is insane . 
  that kind of number of sudden job seekers will create massive distortions in the market . 
  and a weak euro is good for germany . . 
  they 'll be raped in the negotiations . 
  they need to take at least a few years off . . 
  he 's not . 
  that 's kinda sad actually . . 
  tourism is on a whole other level in bulgaria . 
  we 're not 10 but 20 years behind concerning that sector . 
  im sure there are others . . 
  a lot of incest happened though . . 
  even if so , the british press would still lead the lot . . 
  one of the motives the us invests military in europe is that europe does n't become best buddy with russia i think . . 
  turkey will probably pay dearly for this along the way . . look at greece . . 
  you mean the one in 2008 ? 
  no , not a lot . 
  it is as if it never happened . . 
  meet the english press . 
  a pile of vile filth . . 
  wow !, 
  rooms must be tiny . 
  i would go with spanish ( if you 're not from a lesson background ) . 
  here 's why . 
  the romance languages are very similar , chances are if you learn one you 'll be able to understand quite a bit of the rest . 
  so if you know spanish you basically also know a little italian , romanian , portuguese etc. . 
  that 's aprox 33m2 right ? 
  is that a one room plus a small kitchen and a bathroom ? 
  wtf !, 
  it almost doubled the bitcoins price !, 
  human stupidity is infinite . . 
  orthodox priests are allowed and encouraged to have wives and as many kids as they can . 
  seems priests did a lot of fucking in romania . . 
  what do russians know about creeping expansion ? 
  we might just make it , 
  da fuck is this ? 
  directia nationala anticoruptie = national anticorruption directorate, 
  is it ? 
  do you have any idea what that would even mean ?

  `` arrests have been made and more are under way as we speak , '' he said . 
  deputy interior minister wanis al-sharif said that police were gathering evidence and , in addition to those arrested , some militants were being closely monitored . 
  also , not all libyans should be lumped together with the wackos who killed the american diplomat : http://imgur.com/a/tlcyi  ( that 's the main reason i think a direct democracy ca n't work , sometimes we just become angry and make terrible decisions , like , storming a consulate for no real reason ) true, 
   denmark  ) try living in romania . 
  sometimes i feel like we live at the ends of the earth ... 
   you ca n't just impose a language on people without soviet union like repression . 
  so you 'll need a `` soviet union like repression '' imposed on brussels once it becomes part of free flanders , right ? 
  i 'm not really sure . 
  why would you think that ? 
  i 've always thought about this , albeit with the [ hungarian guard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magyar_garda ) or the [ hvim ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixty-four_counties_youth_movement ) versus the [ ( romanian ) new right ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noua_dreapt%c4%83 ) . 
  i would pay to see that . 
  after all , gladiatorial fights are a roman tradition , and we , as europeans should hold on to our graeco-roman heritage , 
   at this point i only trust an european organism to keep control of the rampant austerity and massive corruption in my country . 
  i 'd welcome an european federation with open arms and a bottle of champagne , if at the time i can afford one . 
  same feeling in romania ( and i bet in bulgaria too ) . 
  i would guess a form of automatic citizenship based on residence . 
  those uk citizens living in scotland ( and probably those born in scotland ) would be granted automatic scottish citizenship . 
  i would also think a form of simplified granting of citizenship to people of scottish ancestry would be set up . 
  so if you parents or grandparents were scottish , but moved to london ( or australia , or wherever ) some decades ago , they would get citizenship easier than , say , an immigrant . 
  ( some european countries have similar schemes of simplified granting of citizenship . 
  romania , hungary and greece i know for sure ), 
   i wonder if that means that the ( rest of the ) uk must reapply too . 
  i think the uk-lite will be seen as the successor state of the uk-of-now , and not as a new country , therefore all uk-eu agreements will still stand . 
  the uk will not be seen as breaking up , but only scotland will be viewed as seceding from it . 
  see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/successor_state  succession may refer to the transfer of rights , obligations , and/or property from a previously well-established prior state ( the predecessor state ) to the new one ( the successor state ) . 
  transfer of rights , obligations , and property can include overseas assets ( embassies , monetary reserves , museum artifacts ) , ** participation in treaties , membership in international organizations ** , and debts, 
  that would be option b. 
  they are working on it . 
  as it was my first time on that road , i 'm not really sure how much it improved . 
  some sections were quite ok . 
   but i doubt that 3-4 people qualify as a nation . 
  but then you have the complicated question of what is a nation . 
  i was asking more about the general mood of the catalans , not just your opinion particularly . 
  so are people fighting for an independent catalonia in the form of today 's region of catalonia , or independence for all the catalan countries ? 
  wat is the mood in valencia and the balearics ? 
  but it will take some of the steam out of it . 
  yeah , i was surprised this summer to see how many there were on road from vama veche to balchik, 
  go to new zeeland or something ... 
   former gypsies , because being a gypsy is more a matter of mentality than of race . 
  gypsy is overwhelmingly used as an exonym for the roma/romanyes , which are a population of south-asian origin . 
  so tell me how correcting a factual error makes me a defender of stoning/sharia/iran ? 
  [ a worldwide pew survey finds muslims in the balkans are markedly less rigorous in their religious practices than their counterparts elsewhere ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/yijjo/a_worldwide_pew_survey_finds_muslims_in_the/ ), 
  also , it 's on the rise in africa and other parts of the world , thanks to american proselytizing ... 
   or you learn about honor crimes not all muslims commit honor crimes , and not all honor crimes are perpetrated by muslims . 
  there are quite a number of hindu honor crimes in india . 
  yes , they can overlap , but i do n't think that most people here assume hat race is a determining factor for culture . 
   well indeed not , as homosexuality is grounds for beheading iran does not execute by beheading . 
  saudi arabia does . 
   we have neo-nazis walking around propagating for a new holocaust etc. 
  yet their race/beliefs is never brought up . 
  they are just , rightfully so , seen as complete idiots . 
  true . 
  they are no more part of the so called ` western culture of tolerance ' that the jihadis . 
   would you then start going to a mosque every sunday ( ? ), 
  [ friday ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/friday_mosque ), 
   the level of racism of / r/europe is just intolerable call it xenophobia . 
  it 's not ( mainly ) about race , but about culture , and racism is n't a synonym for xenophobia . 
  plus if you call it racism , they 'll pull the ` islam is not a race ' card . 
  they do . 
  and it 's wrong . 
  i 'm not saying there are no shitty gypsy or muslim communities . 
  but you ca n't judge how representative they are based solely on personal experience . 
   but i suspect they would integrate better , if we had mixed them up better with the local population rather than putting them all together in ghettoes . 
  yep ... http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2012/03/marseille/dickey-text,

  attila is a common name among hungarians . 
  acces to central asia 's oil and gas is done via georgia and azerbaidjan ( when not done through russia ) . 
  if azerbaidjan becomes unstable or the regime changes , european dependence on russian gas will increase a lot . 
  now ask eastern europe how they feel about that . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/azerbajdjan#transportation  azerbaijan is also an important economic hub in the transportation of raw materials . 
  the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan pipeline ( btc ) became operational in may 2006 and extends more than 1,774 kilometers through the territories of azerbaijan , georgia and turkey . 
  the btc is designed to transport up to 50 million tons of crude oil annually and carries oil from the caspian sea oilfields to global markets . 
  the south caucasus pipeline , also stretching through the territory of azerbaijan , georgia and turkey , became operational at the end of 2006 and offers additional gas supplies to the european market from the shah deniz gas field . 
  shah deniz is expected to produce up to 296 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year . 
  azerbaijan also plays a major role in the eu-sponsored silk road project . 
  before anybody starts with the `` armenia and azerbaidjan is not europe '' please keep in mind that transcaucasia : a ) is sometimes included culturally in europe , as it 's mostly christian , and the muslims are quite secular b ) is relevant to european interests geopolitically and a war on europe 's fringe is bad news, 
   please , do n't just run around reddit bashing your country , you 're not the only one living in it , and it affects all of us because of ignorant people like you who only look at it from their own point of view , developed because of the mass-media focusing only on those students that failed their exam , and making them the laughing stock of a country . 
  please spare me the nationalist rhetoric . 
  the `` educational system '' is not only made up of universities , so please do n't accuse me of cherry picking , when you 're doing it yourself .

  we top the lists , with having won these year gold and silver medals in all the fields listed above , at highschool level . 
  you ca n't argue that * overall * the system is good , because the top ones are spectacular . 
  that 's like arguing that there is no poverty in africa because some africans ( the politicians ) are filthy rich . 
  also , anecdotal evidence is not relevant evidence . 
  you can not analyze a system based on your biases and limited experience . 
  that is what is truly self-centered and narrow-minded .

   although half the police voted for it i remember that statement being debunked round here ... 
  i have no idea . 
  [ this article from may ] ( http://croatiantimes.com/news/general_news/2012-05-11/26988/only_8_eu_nations_so_far_wont_restrict_croatian_workers_ ) says yes . 
   if possible , invest in an e-reader that is actually very high on my list . 
  i have loads of cool books on pdf and i hate reading on the computer .

  betteridge 's law of headlines : `` any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no . '', 
  so it went up from 4.6 % to 8.9 % ? 
  this is part of the `` lying with statistics '' series . 
  during the communist era , there were far more roma who graduated high school , so they could also say that `` roma high school graduates and higher education has halved in 25 years '' . 
  ... and there it goes out the window germany 's technological superiority . 
  hide yo kings . 
  i think there were quite a few kings assassinated by anarchists . 
  * millions of empty homes * millions of people who ca n't afford houses the solution ? 
  10 times higher property taxes for inhabited homes ( with an exception allowing one holiday home per family ) . 
   are you saying no sharing is needed ? 
  i was not saying that i agree with all those points , i just said this is what people think . 
   really ? 
  i see the exact opposite happen . 
  they feel that the neoliberal values ( `` free market at all costs '' ) are enshrined in the basic documents of the eu . 
  this was the reason why the left-wingers in france and other countries opposed the european constitution a few years ago . 
  i am a federalist , but i can understand some of their concerns : * people in northern europe do n't trust the people of other countries in southern and eastern europe ( much of this is due to a caricatural image in their press , too ) * people in richer countries ( north or south ) think they 'd need to `` share '' more of their wealth with poorer ( eastern european ) countries * national identities are going to fade away faster and there are still quite a lot of people who think this is a bad thing * left-wingers in western european countries think that any step away from the nation-states is going to be a step away from welfare state and more towards a neoliberal state . 
  * eastern europeans ( especially hungarians , romanians and bulgarians ) began to have a slight euroscepticism due to the feeling that everything in their countries is owned by foreigners and they must pay rents for using their own resources . 
   you 'd be surprised . 
  tito is not that highly regarded in current day croatia , at least not in the center-right leaning segments of society . 
  maybe the croatians and serbs i happen to know are all left-wingers . 
  when we met in zagreb a few years ago , they all had only good things to say about tito . 
    modern croatian nationalists would have more nice things to say about good ole adolf , than about josip broz . 
  oh , ** that ** kind of nationalists !, 
  of course , but nutrition is one of those mandatory factors . 
  with bad nutrition , the other factors no longer matter . 
   mid-day meal programs in schools are essential to ensuring children are well fed ... and well-fed children are essential in having a healthy and intelligent next generation . 
  you know those iq by nation maps which show people from africa having low iq while compared to europeans , north americans and asians ? 
  the reason is in nutrition , not genetics . 
  authoritarian schmucks !, 
  i 'd send them up to the [ fletcher memorial home for incurable tyrants and kings ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqonco0a68o ) . 
  if any yugoslavs hear you , they 'll complain that it 's not fair because tito was n't like the others . 
   [ europeans ] feel that the economic narrative of recent years has been driven by dry technical concerns ; for example , by calculations geared primarily by a consideration of the impact on speculative markets , rather than by sufficient compassion and empathy with the predicament of european citizens who are members of a union . 
  indeed . 
  the eu badly needs to become a federation . 
  this would not be a problem within a federation , but now , the young southern and eastern europeans who are working in other countries do not contribute for their own parents ' pensions and health care , but they contribute to their new country 's system . 
  afaik , bacon does n't create physical dependence . 
  what a silly idea : then kids will drink it because it 's banned . 
  the solution is education , not banning it . 
   using the same principle minors should also be banned from fast food actually , i went a few weeks ago to eat at mcdonald 's . 
  i work somewhere around the business district in bucharest ( close to pia\u021ba victoriei ) and i expected the customers to be the usual corporate workers who eat in the other restaurants in the area . 
  but it was full of high schoolers who just finished their classes . 
  i could complain about these young people , but then i 'd feel like a priest who complains about how many respectable people he saw inside the brothel . 
  afterall , i went there to eat in the first place . 
   yes , because one day i drank a litre of fizzy drinks and now i am hooked , having to drink litre after litre to simply give a feeling of normality . 
  actually , some people do get hooked by coca-cola and drink 1-2 litres of it every day . 
  the mix of caffeine and sugar can create dependence . 
  it 's a visual representation of electricity consumption . 
  it would be half of the country if it would be less < 100 % of the national median . 
  anyone who lives within 200 metres of a gyspy automatically becomes poor . 
   should be able to , with ** a decent government ** , to lift itself out of poverty over time where can we get one of these things ? 
  because in each country , most things ( including housing , utilities , even food ) are priced according to the median income . 
  300 $ in romania do n't have the same buying power as 300 $ in norway . 
  in romania , we got a nice piece of land ( dobruja ) along the black sea after we got our independence ( thanks , russia ! ), 
  and with it , we got plenty of turks . 
  the turkish people here are nice people , we get along fine and there has never been any problem with them , afaik . 
  as an interesting anecdote , a few years ago , their mufti was called up to the saudi embassy and they `` recommended '' him to be more radical about the insults of islam in muhamad cartoons ( which were republished in newspapers here ) ; this happened after he said that those cartoons are no big deal and that romanian muslims should not be enraged by them . 
  i have n't seen any statistics or studies , i just noticed from the news that the mass shootings in europe happen in countries with widely available guns . 
  i do n't think it 's a coincidence that they happened in norway ( breivik ) , finland ( [ jokela ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jokela_school_shooting ) , [ kauhajoki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kauhajoki_school_shooting ) ) , sweden ( [ malm\u00f6 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009\u20132010_malm\u00f6_shootings ) ) , but none in spain , which has very few guns . 
  note that the overall crime rate is higher in spain than in scandinavia . 
  well , the criminality is n't usually reflected by the number of guns , but mass shootings tend to be in such gun-crazed countries , even if they 're generally peaceful places ( norway , finland , etc ) . 
  the devils are already on strike . 
  in completely unrelated news , serbia has the most guns per capita in europe . 
  ( or possibly , second after switzerland , depending on whose estimates )  recently , the serbian daily newspaper `` vecernje novosti '' published `` serbians are armed to the teeth '' ( srbi naoru\u017eani do zuba ) . 
   the article claims that the citizens in serbia currently possess about three million illegal firearms . 
  [ source ] ( http://europeandcis.undp.org/blog/2013/03/26/guns-in-serbia-where-are-the-numbers-coming-from/ ), 
  even if they had no resources , they could have lived off shipbuilding , software and tourism . 
  norway has only around 5 million people . 
  [ 21 incredibly angry songs about margaret thatcher ] ( http://www.buzzfeed.com/angelameiquan/21-incredibly-angry-songs-about-margaret-thatcher ), 
  you do n't know the first rule of balkan internet arguing : every [ foo ] ian is responsible for every action ever made by a [ foo ] ian . 
   oh balkans , please cut this bullshit already ... 
  should n't the vlachs and slavic macedonians of greece have education in their languages and bilingual signs ? 
  here in romania , we used to have a pay-as-you-go system of pensions : what was taxed from the employees was paid to the pensioners . 
  however , the government came with a great idea : `` private pensions '' . 
  so , the taxes go to the private pension companies ( which are basically big banks , i personally use ing bank 's pensions ) who then lend most of the money to the romanian government . 
  you might say it 's the same thing . 
  if the government ca n't pay its debt equals government ca n't pay the pensions . 
  for the regular people , it seems to be the same . 
  but for the banks , it 's not . 
  each year , they get 1 % of the sum for `` administration '' , no matter what . 
  basically , we 're paying 1 % more for nothing . 
  here in romania , all major parties have their own paid-posters ( `` postaci '' in romanian ) , who post opinions on all romanian-language forums , trying to swing the public opinion against or for a certain party . 
  similarly , companies have their own `` postaci '' for trying to mend their reputation online . 
  yeah , but unfortunately none of the rivers ' phonetics fit to the latin/dacian to romanian phonology . 
  they were borrowed to romanian from other sources . 
  for instance , alutus -  olt is probably via a slavic intermediary . 
  for most of the other large rivers , we do n't know what was the intermediary . 
  danube is an exception because its phonology makes it possible to have entered romanian in ancient times , even though its reconstructed form , * donaris is quite different from the latin danubius . 
  timi\u0219 might show an albanian/dacian feature of b/m change , so it 's possible that it was borrowed in romanian directly from the dacians . 
  also , the etymology of arge\u0219 is n't ancient ordessos like some of our linguists claim , but some cuman word for `` highlands '' ; initially the name was borrowed as `` arghi\u0219 '' ( which looks nothing like ordessos ) and in time mutated to `` arge\u0219 '' . 
   you 're really stretching the definition of colony . 
  yes , of course , it 's not a `` colony '' as in `` the age of colonization '' , it 's more like an `` expansion '' . 
  nevertheless , it 's not uncommon to use the word `` colonization '' for this . 
   afaik , slavic toponyms are distributed rather equally regardless of altitude/geography . 
  not really . 
  in the plains , there are far more . 
  i do n't have real data , but that 's what i noticed . 
  compare the names of the [ highest mountains in romania ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_mountains_in_romania ) with the name of rivers in the plains . 
  around bucharest , for instance , almost all the rivers have slavic names : d\u00e2mbovi\u021ba , colentina , mosti\u0219tea , cociovali\u0219tea , ialomi\u021ba , ilfov , snagov etc. 
  we , romanians , colonized plenty of places during the medieval times , but not by our state , but by simple people who moved for greener pastures ( literally , since many were shepherds ) . 
  in some places , we were assimilated by the locals , in others , we assimilated the locals .

  yes . 
  i do n't think that being anti-immigration is equivalent to being authoritarian . 
  this is a phenomenon which deserves it 's own axis with positions ranging from full open-borders to full-blown nationalism . 
  does `` bivol '' mean buffalo in bulgarian ? 
  no wonder migrants do n't want to stay in france . 
  this could be from romania , but the road looks too well-maintained . 
  [ the business implications are clear ] ( https://xkcd.com/1138 ), 
  corruption ? 
  when the tax people come you bribe them so they look away . 
  it 's very common in romania as well . 
  from that document 's first footnote :  the gender pay gap ( gpg ) in unadjusted form represents the difference between average gross hourly earnings of male paid employees and of female paid employees as a percentage of average gross hourly earnings of male paid employees , in the sectors of industry , construction and services ( except public administration , defense , compulsory social security ) . 
  the indicator has been defined as unadjusted ( e.g. 
  not adjusted according to individual characteristics that may explain part of the earnings difference ) because it should give an overall picture of gender inequalities in terms of pay . 
  the gender pay gap is the consequence of various inequalities ( structural differences ) in the labour market such as different working patterns , differences in institutional mechanisms and systems of wage setting . 
  consequently , the pay gap is linked to a number of legal , social and economic factors which go far beyond the single issue of equal pay for equal work so it 's the average of all workers . 
  i do n't understand this . 
  why should britain give money to calais to fix it 's mess ? 
  the obvious solution is for the french police to process all of these people . 
  grant refugee status ( in france ) to the people who fit the criteria and deport the rest . 
  the real embarrassment is that red-blue gradient . 
  this is just ridiculous bullshit . 
  who upvotes this crap ? 
  also romanians are not usually considered slavs . 
  afaik only the communist party is banned . 
  also , the source looks like a local us news site . 
  there is nothing about this in romanian news . 
  i think the article is simply inaccurate . 
  what the fuck is wrong with france ? 
  then they should n't be meps . 
  the protesters just surrendered ? 
  why not crimea as well ? 
  the glory of socialism !, 
  tl ; dr : the nazis are invading again, 
  i do n't really understand your complaint . 
  all democracies have a few dominant parties . 
  the difference between two-party and multi-party systems is how easy it is for small parties to get representation . 
  i 'm theory one could imagine a system where no party reaches 20 % or even 15 % but i do n't see why that would be desirable . 
  that 's the kind of stuff romania is proud of . 
   1 / we censure delist most of those links to keep this subreddit clean of propaganda but then a lot of people would complain of censorship , and they would be right .

  my point is that he is n't just corrupt , he is now responsible for mass murder . 
  when you type something in between the quotation marks google will look for exactly that word or phrase . 
  would you care to elaborate on why exactly you think it 's a shithole ? 
  or are you going to cry about being downvoted because you have ` different opinions ' ? 
  does it come as a surprise that a country that constantly represses protests and promotes discrimination is n't exactly the first country most of us think of when we talk about democracies ? 
  i think the vote is secret and anonymous , so that would n't work . 
  besides , switzerland as a country has agreed to the terms of free movement , so the measures taken in response to their decision to limit migration will have to affect the country and thus the citizens . 
  also , it would n't be very democratic to punish people based on their vote . 
  i think you define it relative to the wealthiest . 
  if you were to multiply all the current incomes by , say , 5 , you would still have the same inequality ; the poorest would still be the poorest , and the wealthiest would still be the wealthiest . 
  also , take into consideration that the costs of living in such a hypothetical situation would also grow proportionately , so no one would feel any real improvement . 
  there 's nothing inherently good about inequality . 
  i can understand and agree that we should n't necessarily actively try to reduce inequality , but i would n't mind if there were less poor people . 
  you should read up on the concept of tyranny of the majority , as others have already suggested . 
  frankly , if you consider everything a majority ( 50 % + 1 ) decides as being perfectly democratic , you could run into a lot of paradoxal situations , in which that same majority decides to infringe upon other peoples ' rights , and by doing so they neglect the very principles that gave them the opportunity to decide in the first place . 
  now what i wrote here is n't necessarily about the particular case of the law that 's being abrogated , because i actually understand that its terms have n't been really equitable , but more generally about your understanding of what democracy is and what its limits are . 
  i assume it 's not a decision made solely by him , but rather it 's the result of discussions with other politicians , including the chancellor , as well as foreign policy , diplomatic and security advisors and experts and this is just one of the first hints regarding an upcoming public debate about a shift in the foreign policy of germany . 
   the soviet times were the best regime ukraine ever liver under , unprecedented prosperity https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor, 
  real in this case means ` existent ' so of course `` abstract '' things exist as well . 
  just because it is n't palpable , visible , audible etc. 
  does not mean that it does n't exist . 
  ontologically , * everything * is real . 
  there is nothing that is not real . 
  thus , the question we should be asking is what is the type of existence that something has ( its ontological status ) . 
  take a concept , for example ; maybe ` freedom ' does not meet the criteria for something that is real according to your definition of reality , but the simple fact that we can talk about it and attribute meaning to it makes it real . 
  now , states are n't even as abstract as you suggest . 
  there are many forms of manifestation of the state , not just the written rules ( the constitution , laws etc. ), 
  that we might consider abstract , for example the institutions that we interact with every day , in one way or another . 
  countries have even more ` physical ' features , usually the geographical aspect being essential in defining them , as well as the inhabitants .

  i never said that it should be this way only for medical students .

  it has nothing to do with `` the free movement of persons within the eu . '', 
  there are countries that ask students to sign a contract agreeing that they would stay and work in the country ( for a few years ) in exchange for free or almost free education . 
  alternatively , they would have to pay the cost of their education and would be free to go .

  thanks for providing the source . 
  anyway , would n't it be a little weird for such a small territorial entity with discontinuous territory to become independent ? 
  how would it effectively administer and organize itself ? 
  i have heard that in the event of a possible unification of moldova and romania , gagauzia would have the constitutional right to decide its own future : whether to secede and become independent or to remain a part of moldova and thus of romania . 
  however i ca n't provide a source , and after looking this up in the [ constitution of moldova ] ( http://legislationline.org/documents/action/popup/id/16261/preview ) , i ca n't find anything to clearly support this . 
  do you know anything about such a clause ? 
  of course , this would n't really give them the right to do what they do right now , since no one has brought up the unification officially . 
  i think that all over europe it is both cultural and price-related . 
  double plot twist : bezbojnicul is british . 
  to be honest , it 's extremely simplistic to view romanians as the mere result of a prolonged interaction between dacians and romans . 
  there are a lot more ethnicities and cultures that have contributed to what we consider romanian today . 
  funny he , of all people , should say that . 
  hey !, 
  i hope you do n't mind , but i 've linked the subreddit to / r/newreddits in the hope that it will help attract more subscribers .

  at least , not anymore . 
  i just mentioned it thinking that you might have heard that word . 
  ever heard of staropramen ? 
   edit : i think that the romanian * stare\u021b * `` abbot '' is also derived from a cognate of * starou * , probably old church slavonic * star\u016d * ( \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044a ) `` old '' . 
  he was only under preventive arrest for a while . 
  we 'll see if he 'll ever be sentenced . 
  yes . 
  if they made this kind of deal then they are no better than the others before them and the ones that they 're jailing . 
  it means that they are protecting a person that they know has broken the law , and are protecting him . 
  what guarantee is there that they wo n't do it again in the future ? 
  if the justice system needs the go-ahead of the president in order for it to function and do its job , there 's no reason to vaunt it and be so ecstatic about our country 's fight against corruption . 
  nah , both of them are shit . 
  actually , i 'd say that b\u0103sescu has done more harm . 
  not only that , but it seems that the justice system , as much praise as it received in the last few years , still ca n't or wo n't even try to do anything about him . 
  however , most romanians on reddit like him very much . 
  in fact , they think he 's very `` cool '' and all that , although if any other politician ( except maybe macovei , who 's also a favourite of romanian redditors ) would abuse their power as much and as blatantly as he did , they would go nuts , and for good reason . 
  but yeah , he 's `` b\u0103se '' , so he 's cool , no problem . 
  oh , i 'm also talking about western and northern europeans . 
  the situation is better there , but only slightly so . 
  i 've seen that too from people like the ones you describe . 
  but they are still largely ignorant when it comes to the subject of the middle east . 
  i know how before this crisis the people i would try to have a conversation with about the middle east , european issues , geopolitics -- which are all topics that are at least somewhat related to one of my fields of study -- almost none of them were particularly interested and this was because they did n't know as much about the topics . 
  the only thing that everyone knew was al-qaeda and more recently isis . 
  but ever since the refugee crisis started pretty much all of them have a very passionate opinion , and since they previously only associated the region and muslims or arabs , in general , with terrorist organisations , that explains it . 
  there are people who make an effort to get a better understanding of the history of the mena conflicts , about the societies there , about the cultures , and i respect that , but most people are only interested in confirming their own beliefs , which are founded on very limited and information that led them to believe that most refugees are somehow islamist extremists . 
  edit : a few words . 
  because they 're ignorants and xenophobes . 
  i 'm sure most of them could n't even find syria on a map . 
  hell , probably they could n't even find the middle east ... 
  but suddenly everyone 's an expert on geopolitical matters regarding the region , as well as its history and international relations . 
   i doubt that 30 % of the french people are actually far-right extremists . 
  if you vote for them maybe you have to accept that you pretty much are just that . 
  after all , all extremists tell themselves something along the lines of : `` it 's the only solution '' , `` we reached our limit '' , `` the end is nigh '' , etc. 
  so please , at least accept them for what they are , do n't try to sugarcoat it . 
  edit : punctuation and a few words . 
   you can define it in several ways since we already have the geographic definition of europe to start from . 
  and most gypsies are inside this geographically defined area . 
  so , what exactly is your point ? 
  what exactly is so hard about it ? 
  upvote what you like and do n't downvote based on people 's opinions . 
  it 's incredible what this subreddit has become in the past weeks . 
  just look at this perfectly relevant self post and how many people have tried to stifle it with downvotes .

  like i said , i completely understand that . 
  i just think romania is n't the 3rd world hellhole it was in the 90s , we 're actually starting to do pretty well for ourselves , at least in the big cities . 
  in bucharest , it 's not unheard of to work for 2-3-4 thousand euros / month , though those salaries mostly go in it , which is one of the few sectors where we 're competitive in . 
  even if you have no skills , you can still earn fairly decent money by working in , like , a car wash . not through salary , but over here it 's customary to tip the person who washes your car ; i have a friend who makes ~ 700 euros / month washing cars . 
  weather is here , wish you were beautiful . 
  :p in all seriousness , romania still has the image of `` third world shithole '' , and , honestly , outside the major cities , it pretty much is . 
  we still have , in 2015 , rural areas 15km outside bucharest that do n't have gas lines or running water . 
  but most of the big cities have a pretty high standard of living - bucharest , for example , provides 21 % of romania 's gdp by itself . 
  i do n't have any recent numbers , but wikipedia states :  in 2009 , at purchasing power parity , bucharest had a per-capita gdp of $ 26,100 , or 111 % that of the european union average and more than twice the romanian average . 
  i get that , i was n't trying to draw a direct comparison ; the point was more along the lines of `` syrians are already an established minority in romania , i think they could integrate just fine in romania if they wanted to '', 
  for one , not enough people available - as far as i know , most of these big factories are situated outside the big population centers , closer to villages than cities . 
  second , the 800-1000 euro salary might be inflated , i heard it from someone else , and i ca n't really check to see if it 's true ; i think a more realistic range would be 400-600 euros . 
  romania has plenty of factories without workers , especially automotive ones ; one owner said recently that he would hire 10000 people if he could find them . 
  it 's manual labor that as far as i know does n't require a high degree of specialization or highly technical degrees , provides on-the-job training , pays pretty well ( upwards of $ 800-1000 / month , i heard , though i do n't know how true it is ) , people could conceivably make a life for themselves over here , i believe . 
  well , the problem is that germany and eu have been sending extremely mixed signals . 
  germany said it welcomes all syrian refugees , then goes and and says that schengen area is `` threatened '' and complains that countries are n't doing a better job at protecting their borders . 
  then , to make matters worse , hungary , who actually tried to respect eu laws regarding refugees and border control gets called `` fascistic '' because of that . 
  on the one hand , i completely understand wanting to make the best life you can for your family , but ... it 's not like eastern/southern europe is some sort of civil-war-torn shithole , you can make a good life for yourself over here too , if you 're smart about it . 
  you wo n't be making hundreds of thousands of euros per year , but you wo n't be making that as a refugee anywhere . 
  smurd , the romanian medical emergency response system was started and maintained by a syrian national , [ raed arafat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raed_arafat ) . 
  he was even our minister of health for a short time ( he did n't really want to do it , just accepted an interim position for , like , a week ) . 
  he 's so well liked that romanians protested en masse when our former president wanted to remove him from smurd and place someone else there . 
  personally , i do n't think syrians would have that much trouble integrating in romania if they wanted to stay here . 
  jesus , man , 6 russia-related posts in 15 minutes , you really have a hardon for 'em . 
  christ , you 're not wrong . 
  besides the frontpage being flooded with refugee-related posts , the comments have been getting more and more insane lately . 
  i hope you end up selected as a mod . 
  ! '' translated :  we ran , we did n't think !, 
  we did n't think where we 'd go to when we left our houses . 
  we left because we were forced by bashar al-assad from one side , isis from the other . 
  what could i do ? 
  wait for them to chop my head off or run ?!, 
  which , honestly , is completely understandable . 
  though now that they 're safe , it 's not good enough anymore , for some reason . 
  it 's kinda funny to me , though , to see even syrian refugees looking down on romania . 
  make them break into the sierra madre !, 
   dangerous leftist extremists can you explain that to me , please ? 
  i get the leftist part , but i fail to see how they 're dangerous extremists . 
  downvoted for [ telling the truth ] ( http://i.imgur.com/in0e0ur.jpg ) . 
  this sub has wholly turned to shit . 
  i literally just had dinner , but that pic made me hungry again :p, 
  that looks delicious !, 
  i 'd totally eat the fuck out of it !, 
  i still fail to see why anyone should care at all . 
  my bad , i interpreted the `` anyone '' as in `` why would anyone ever want foreigners to come and steal their women ??? '', 
   would anyone find it preferable if they were dating and marrying the native population ? 
  as long as they respect the law , why would you care at all ? 
  the quota would n't do anything , nobody wants to go to eastern europe , even though we 're in the eu . 
  why would they stay here and work for $ 300 / month when they can go to germany and get more than that just from welfare ? 
  are you suggesting we hold them here by force ? 
  and this is the most common rebuke from racists . 
  `` oh , i do n't mean * all * < < ethnicity   , i just meant those damn < < insert racist stereotype   ! '', 
  except now it 's with white people and white guilt . 
  i am a white european that wants more refugees to be allowed here . 
  explain to me how i , as a romanian , have any sort of white guilt regarding syrian refugees . 
  or why i should or somehow * would * feel that way because of the color of my skin . 
  you are making a generalization about me based * purely on the color of my skin * . 
  no , you implied that the reason why people are n't opposed to refugees is based on their skin color - the fact that they are white is the reason why they are n't opposed to taking in refugees . 
  how do you not get how that is racist ? 
  by saying that the only reason people are n't opposed refugees is because of their racial prejudices specifically related to the color of their skin - which is a super fucking racist generalization , fuckwit . 
  you do realize you can be racist against white people too , right ? 
  putting it down to `` white guilt '' is racist . 
  no , no , most people have found their position , and it 's that of not being a racist fuckhead . 
  well , i get it i guess . 
  thanks for explaining it to me . 
  ok , thanks for the explanation , but why ? 
  it 's pretty clear you 're referring to the eu without uk when talking about negotiations and agreements and what , that r in this context is just there , it does n't add any extra information that could n't be deduced by context . 
  sorry for the unrelated tangent . 
  why do you keep saying reu ? 
  what does that mean ? 
  can i have some cab fare if you 're not gon na buy me breakfast at least ? 
  what would the person who likes you most in the world ( that is n't you ) say when they 're asked about you ? 
  conversely , what would the person who likes you * least * ( also not you ) say ? 
  please describe a time when you had a disagreement with your supervisor and what steps you would take to make sure said disagreement would n't happen again . 
   my fetish is being asked difficult interview questions that have no right answer so where do you see yourself in 2 years and what will you do get there ? 
  what would you say your coworkers think your biggest weakness is ? 
   pure censorship can you please explain for everybody how a visible , accessible , stickied post at the top of the subreddit is * pure censorship * ? 
  you really need to take your tinfoil hat off , your crazy is showing . 
  srs has n't been relevant in years , it 's only stupid people and bigots that still hold it as some sort of boogeyman . 
  i honestly have n't been involved in meta-reddit in a long time , i rarely even check the modmail for those subs anymore , not that it even matters . 
  if i had to deal with people like you that see conspiracies and secret agendas every day , i 'd lose it . 
  but hey , thanks for reminding me that it 's not worth it . 
  actually , you 're right . 
  well , i disagree about the `` shitpost '' part , i think i make plenty of good posts . 
  but i am biased , especially against racism and sexism . 
  in general , i 'm wholly against bigotry and unapologetic about it . 
  so you accuse me of being biased , a shitposter and not objective because you disagree with my opinions - without providing * any * concrete backup for your claim that this somehow influences my ability to be a good moderator - yet i 'm the one that 's not impartial ? 
  what would that do anyway ? 
  nobody wants to immigrate to romania , and i 'm pretty sure he 's not suggesting we hold them here by force . 
  romania could take literally all of them and it still would n't make a difference overall , 90 % would leave for western europe as soon as they could . 
  depends on how active the subs are . 
  most of the subs i mod are fairly inactive ( a few only get 2-3 posts per day ) , so they do n't really take that much time to keep clean . 
  a couple of them , honestly , i do n't do anything in ; i just hang around for the modmail . 
  that being said , i only moderate subs i actually enjoy , related to my interests , with a subject matter and community i care about ; i 'm a volunteer , i moderate because i want to help . 
  a lot of people tend to `` collect '' mod positions for some reason ( shits & giggles ? 
  ) , but that sounds pretty tiresome to me . 
  a lot of extra work for basically no reason that i can see . 
  lol wtf are you talking about ? 
  power mod ? 
  agenda ?

  visited half of the rivers on that list and i have seen nowhere near that level of litter . 
  those pictures are exceptions . 
  i also do n't know when they were taken . 
  visited some of those rivers and my experience has been totally different . 
  it 's just a case of picking those pictures that look the worst for a little extra karma . 
  an exercise i 've seen romanian redditors here indulge in well too often . 
   encryption ca n't be broken , but the message can be saved for later retrieval . 
  that 's complete gibberish . 
  you know there 's lots of zero knowledge system providers , right ? 
  that means that they do n't save anything - and they make a point of that because it 's their usp . 
  and this can be demonstrated by the fact that many of them ca n't port accounts between devices ( since there 's no central server where that data is saved ) , or do n't have a backup functionality . 
  this is absolutely about legally mandating encryption backdoors . 
  not even close . 
  you still have way worse data retention laws . 
  still , there are lots of other rivers in the country . 
  and that 's rubbish accumulation in certain areas of the flow . 
  this post makes it look like every waterway in the country is as dirty as these pictures , which is absolutely not true . 
  i doubt that all rivers and lakes look like that . 
  where 's that from , btw ? 
  how presumptuous of you . 
  i 've been there several times , so the impressions i 've made are based on what i 've seen and experienced . 
  and i know this might sound inconceivable , but if i 'd ever want to move to another country , social welfare would n't be the single guiding principle i 'd base my decision on . 
  i do n't really get this either . 
  the uk is absolutely a wicked place to visit - a shitload of stuff to do and to see . 
  but living there ? 
  not for me . 
  i know there 's the whole money/opportunities reason but there are way nicer countries with comparable standards of living you could choose from right now . 
  i guess the simplest explanation for most people is language . 
   plus there is a massive double standard as people from those eastern european countries are all in favor of bashing muslims and non-eu immigrants but think that they are something better . 
  you 're confusing the idiots on reddit with real live people , mate . 
  the former is just a vocal minority you see on this subreddit - nothing like a number you 'd consider representative for a whole country . 
  plus , you know that people in western europe are from different `` cultures '' too , right ? 
  keep countering it with facts , and do n't give in when you see that all sense of logic falls away during one of those conversations . 
  and as for long term strategy goes , i actually think that we should develop our own type of populism . 
  sadly , it 's the only type of dialogue many people seem to listen to in this anti-intellectual , emotion first age we live in . 
  might not be that effective overall because we 'd actually need to tell the truth . 
  and truth is not always as appealling as all the bombastic conspiracy theories people seem to lap up . 
  but i certainly think we should give it a go . 
  come off it mate . 
  this comment is beyond stupid . 
  i think that the intended message was that we should n't fight against minorities , or they against us . 
  we should come `` together '' , because we 'd be stronger . 
  ... or something to that effect . 
  my question was n't about facebook privacy , but about the way mercer and co used it in the brexit campaign . 
  also , looking through the comments in this thread i see that people who want to play this down are using the same old false equivalence tactic - the `` when they do it it 's targeting a certain demographic , when others do it , it 's psychological manipulation '' argument . 
  and then , the complementary response . 
  pointing the finger at the other side 's hypocrisy without actually having a meaningful response . 
  classic disinformation tactic , really . 
  and yes , the alt-right 's ( or whatever you wan na call it ) internet disinformation machine is quite real and openly combative . 
  much more so than the other side - it does n't take long for me to click some youtube embedded link in an article about brexit to be then swamped with inane crap like `` brexit supporter destroys leftie snowflake '' . 
  much to the same vain as the videos about putin `` destroying '' cnn reporters whenever i watch a video about the situation in ukraine . 
  i see the same type of discourse at home too , and it 's totally distorting people 's perception about reality . 
  that is why i think it 's essential that every time we see it , we expose it for the utter drivel it really is . 
  does that make it ok then ? 
  greeks never recognized minorities . 
  they were considered greeks by the state long before the so called `` extra baggage '' . 
  as a matter of fact , the greek state was all for sped up assimilation , many times against the vlachs ' will . 
  and yes , it should be preserved . 
  we 're hastily heading towards a future where hundreds of languages and regional dialects are becoming extinct , taking with them all the cultural and historical strata coded in them . 
  to that effect , would you call greek `` extra baggage '' in a world where english is increasingly becoming the lingua franca ? 
  if you want to preserve cultural plurality , languages matter . 
   but typically people in the uk do n't consider themselves european . 
  i do n't think i 've ever spoken to a brit who does n't consider himself european or sees the uk as anything else than a european country . 
  sure , there 's disagreement from ( arguably ) a majority of people in britain over belonging to a politico-economical construct that covers most of the continent . 
  and of course , you also belong to the anlgosphere . 
  shared culture and language is important - there 's emil cioran 's famous `` people inhabit a language , not a nation '' quote i 'd never thought i 'd use in this context . 
  ... but that does n't mean that you 're not also a northern european country . 
  i do n't understand why some people think they 're mutually exclusive . 
   and in my defence , this is a problem i 've had with other non-native speakers , particularly over the internet . 
  probably to the same degree i have a problem with spotting nuanced sarcasm from native speakers over the internet . 
  i do n't see the difference between what i know and what i like in the context of this thread . 
  they 're connected , and i see no reason why i should repeat the same banalities i see all over the place . 
   regardless , my comment was not intended as hostile , so back the fuck off . 
  of course it was n't . 
  you do realize that people have different music tastes , do you ? 
  some of those bands might be influential , but i do not fucking like their music . 
  and yes , i think that punk has had a much more valuable influence on music ( and on society , to a certain degree ) than the stones ' vapid pop radio tunes . 
  yes , i do . 
  should i have gone with rick astley instead ? 
  they 're visionary rabble-rousers . 
  they create problems nobody has , then come up with fixes and ( willingly or not ) export them to the world . 
  that 's how they came up with the first shape of a modern parliament in 1265 . 
  honorary mention goes to the icelanders though . 
  also , music , film and literature . 
  wrt music , i 'd single out 60s and 70s punk , the 90s trip-hop scene around bristol , and experimental electronica ( warp records , planet mu , skam , etc ) . 
  outside of radiohead , ca n't really stand indie and i do n't know why it 's such a big thing . 
  and if i were to pick a film , the example most fitting for the times would be [ the ruling class ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069198/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) . 
   what ? 
  does romania have a much more american system of persecution then i expected ? 
  you know that prosecutors are n't exclusive to america , right ? 
  in romania they 're civil servants just as the judges are . 
  dna is an organization of prosecutors - their job is to find evidence . 
  evidence that judges then judge upon . 
   when the system is already corrupt ? 
  i do n't know what you mean by that . 
  corruption is rife here , but it 's more of a problem of government and local administration . 
  i 'd say that it is less of a problem for the judiciary - that 's why they are attacking the justice system so hard right now . 
  like i said in my previous comment , nothing can be ruled out , but i trust a judge way more than i trust a government official right now . 
   id does n't have to be false , just hearsay and unreliable , just enough to open an investigation which will be then last until the election . 
  those kinds of accusations for political benefit usually come from individuals with interests , not from any official anti-corruption body .

and london . 
  they 'll probably form a city state like hong kong or singapore, 
   illegal immigration is illegal for a reason . 
  why, 
   the cheapest places in europe are bulgaria , romania , poland and hungary , with prices up to two times less expensive than the rest of the continent . 
  and wages up to 16 times less, 
  us basically has a culture of cultures .

  it becomes a symbiotic relationship , where we norwegians pretend that this person is more of a celebrity that they are , and they pretend that norway is a bigger market than we are . 
  and so we lull each other in this illusion . 
  this must be a conspiration , i think it 's happening everywhere.steven segall and van damme action movies were the thing in the 95-2000 's in romania . 
  then , after 2009 or so , they started comming to film new movies ( when they had gotten older and forgotten in usa ) . 
  started going to night clubs etc.

  [ you forgot the romanian-bulgarian friendship ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgaria%e2%80%93romania_relations ) there 's quite some stigma towards hungary at a political level ( e.g. 
  countries vs countries ) , but on a personal level it 's very good , but mostly with the hungarians who live in romania . 
  those who live in hungary get bashed for being violent and unreasonable . 
  whenever their natl.

  nokia phones used to be the most premium brand you could ask for some 10 years ago . 
  i remember when i first got a phone , i was so jelly on nokia owners .

  exactly.i thought it was quite an achievement to have this kind of posters in that time and during the events that were unfolding , suporting unity between nations , brotherhood etc.people take for granted slogans like world cup 2014 's `` all in one rythm '' , but it took big leaps to reach this stage , and i think uk played a big part in it . 
  i was doing a course on paradoxes of war at princeton , and i thought it was interesting to share . 
  oh well ... people should n't just jump on to conclusions, 
  i thought the poster showed quite the oposite.oh well ... 
  you do n't happen to have a broader list of countries by nr of tourists yearly , do n't you ? 
  spot on!if people thought gas deals with ukraine are getting messy , they should learn about what happens in central asia between the stans , russia , china , gulf states , iran and india . 
  it 's a hotspot of energy trade deals , transportation deals and so on . 
  things are still verymuch fluid there , in contrast with the rigidity of the eu block for example . 
  i think people are getting used to it ( it 's been half a year already or even more since riots and etc. 
  news started reporting on ukraine ) war between ukraine and russia is really off the books imo , seems verymuchso 99 % impossible . 
  nobody in their right mind is shitting his pants , do n't worry . 
  i think everyone is supposing a war is impossible because of how heavily armed the two sides would be , that would result in a massacre . 
  it should come to no surprise ; cases like these are common not only in slovenia but most of europe nowadays , especially eastern . 
  big shots getting sentenced in bribery cases , or other white collar crime ; but still ... they make big waves in the news . 
  this would have been unheard of prior to eu integration . 
  but is n't it france that is the most visited country by tourists?some 60milions/yearly ? 
  indeed , that would be terrible, 
  there 's a whole set with all the teams [ here ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/world-cup-teams-without-immigrants-2014-6 ) , just thought france 's was interesting because they make up more than 1/3rd of the team , most make the 1st team like pogba , benzema , valbuena , and also the nf won the elections , and they 're anti immigration and w.e. 
  i think everyone knows what 's in store ... us of europe, 
  what do they have to gain from it ? 
  lol socialists are backing [ junker ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/junker ) ? 
  that 's new i thought they had thier own candidade , they paraded him throughout the whole of eu, 
  he 's a socialist , what would you expect ? 
  wich immigrants ? 
  there 's no arguing about it , europe 's gon na turn into a shithole once the extremists have it their way . 
  that argument can be turned the other way ; perhaps people were happy about it , otherwise they would have gone to vote to change the situation if they were unhappy about it ? 
   there is a problem with persons being treated differently because of their heritage you mean inheritance ? 
  or is it that you mean people born in high-end families of lawyers etc ? 
  i would n't have thought this was an issue, 
  do people feel like there are growing disparities?growing inequalities?the need for an equitable redistribution ? 
  i thought sweden was one of the most egalitarian societies . 
  if there 's anyone who would have to be discontent about equality it would be countries like the ones in south america/usa/china etc, 
  oh yes ofcourse . 
  they want to maintain status quo but bring socialism slice by slice.not brutal radical change as in communism , i know . 
  it just makes me wonder why it didnt catch any wind at all in the usa ... what are the swedes unhappy of about after the 2006 , or rather shall i say , what makes the socialist option an attractive one ? 
  oh wow europe is in even a more dire situation than i thought . 
  quite simply socialists on one hand ( terrible choice , socialism is unheard of in usa ) , populists on the other ( the likes of baroso , yet again terrible , telling the people what they want to hear and then shaking hands with business lobby ) and the other is a surging extreme wich takes 1st place in denmark , uk and france . 
  i think we should follow the example of usa . 
  we 're too butthurt on things that in usa are taken for granted . 
  people in west europe bitch about easterners taking jobs . 
  easterners talk about brain drain and poor wages etc. 
  but that 's also true for the usa . 
  you have places where min wage is 6 $ in a state and in another it 's 12 . places where rent costs you 800 $ and others where it costs a mere 100 . houses in the west wich you can buy for 6k $ and 20square meter studios in manhattan for 200k .

  the difference is that between now and then there was a large amount of financial regulation put in place under obama . 
  actually , currently the us financial sector is better regulated than the eu one , specifically the city . 
  i see your `` point '' , i think i 'll ignore you from now on . 
  you understand that this is an internal analyses by the uk treasury , yes ? 
   the idea that trade would come to a stop and 3 million jobs would disappear is fanciful at best . 
  certainly nobody is saying all 3 million jobs would disappear , but likely a lot of them will , you only have to look at the messages all the financial institutions have been sending to know that . 
   but if it ever did some kind of trade arrangement would be struck . 
  perhaps , but what that might be and what it will cost the uk will be nontrivial . 
   the eu exports more to the uk than the us , those businesses ( and those in the uk ) are going to want business to continue as normal . 
  that no longer will be true when the transatlantic trade treaty is signed . 
  also on the grand scheme of things eu exports to uk are nowhere near as important to the eu as it 's for the uk its exports to the eu . 
  the eu makes up almost 50 % of all uk exports , that % is in the single digits for the eu to uk . 
  at what point in the last 300 years has slavic unity meant anything other than russian imperialism ? 
  because after handing him a political bruising that he 'll remember for life , merkel does n't want to be seen like she 's humiliating cameron by pushing for this . 
  merkel actually wants and needs the uk and cameron a whole lot more than the rest of eu leaders . 
  i thought sikorski had an excellent chance at high representative , but with the recent tape of him basically calling cameron an incompetent moron , even though it 's very true , i do n't see him getting the spot anymore . 
  that would be a step to far for cameron i think and he does n't enjoy the legitimacy that juncker has . 
  it actually is , it 's just that the way the rules about the euro are written that they in practice give the member country the option of when to join the ez , since they can always make sure they do n't satisfy the requirements . 
  i would n't mind it at all , but not with that name . 
  united states of europe sounds very bad . 
  nope , actually i 'd be happier if the us moved more troops to romania . 
   frankly , if the uk wants out that much , the eu should respect their wishes , for better or for worse . 
  who 's not respecting it ? 
  i have n't heard anyone say britain should n't be allowed to leave , if that 's what it wants . 
  just make up your minds already and make a decision , either stay and try to work with the others or leave . 
  i think you 've missed the freedom of movement part of the eu , maybe you should try to apply some of these european values you keep screaming about and act like a eu country and respect one of the founding eu principals .

  they are pro-eu because the population is overwhelmingly pro-eu and if any party would be anti-eu they would n't get any votes . 
  please stop making yourself look like a fool . 
  hmm i was under the impression that the austrian anti-eu party did very well , i might have been confused . 
  my bad . 
  predictable but very good news all the same . 
  cameron should quiet down a little and take notes from renzi on how to negotiate in the eu . 
  what ?!?!, 
  romania is one of the most pro-eu countries in the eu , i think you 're knocking on the wrong door . 
   tl ; dr : we were really wrong about the whole juncker thing , but we 're sure we 're right about this other thing . 
  we 're bound to be right one of these days right ? 
  even a broken clock is right twice a day . 
  british conservatives , reaching new peaks in pathetic , quite impressive . 
  you do n't understand , it 's not reform unless it favors britain , if it does n't it 's just one more power grab by federalists in brussels . 
  even if that were true , which it is n't , they are n't going back to anything . 
  they were never pre-1968 social democrats , in 1968 the psd was known as the communist party . 
  his first mistake was being so public in his fight against juncker , because that cut down on his chances to save face and gain a good deal . 
  his second huge mistake was threatening with a british exit , none of the eu leaders can afford to be seen to give into blackmail , that pretty much guaranteed he had no good will from anyone going into any negotiation and it isolated him from any of his allies , since while he can threaten with a british exit , austria , denmark or netherlands ca n't , nor can their leaders be seen to agree with blackmail . 
  his third mistake was asking for a super commissioner , such a obvious power grab would basically guarantee an instant `` no '' answer . 
  what he should have done , is the same thing that renzi is doing quite skillfully . 
  everybody knows that renzi does n't want juncker as president , but you do n't see him writing articles in newspaper about how juncker is bad . 
  in exchange for his quiet support in the council renzi is asking for some concessions that interest him . 
  there is no reason cameron could n't have played the same game , and such a strategy would have allowed merkel to back cameron on some issues . 
  as it stands cameron is alone against the world and losing badly . 
  making yourself into a blackmailing hypocrite helps you negotiate ? 
  i guess that 's what passes for logic for the # 1 troll of / r/europe . 
  you go higher , you do n't go in making yourself looking like a blackmailing hypocrite because that makes even the people that might agree with your completely ignore what you say . 
  i guess we 'll see how this ends , my prediction is that cameron wo n't get anything more than a token concession , certainly not a super commissioner and he 'll end up with juncker as the president , somebody he just made not only an enemy of , but also a representative of the fight against back room deals and guaranteed juncker an ep vote where he 'll get all epp , s&d and alde votes . 
  his defeat could n't be more total if he tried . 
  what he wants and what he 's asking for are two very different things . 
  asking for a super commissioner , while at the same time complaining about democratic deficits is hypocrisy of the highest order and other eu countries will not and indeed should not agree too . 
   well yeah . 
  i mean that is the crux of the argument for eusceptics . 
  give the nations more power as opposed to giving it to the parliament . 
  oh is that what he was doing asking for a super commissioner ? 
  he was n't really making a power grab , he was looking out for the sovereignty of nations , well that 's good to know . 
  such a kind and gentle heart he has , so sad how the ignorant masses of the eu do n't agree with that benevolent plan . 
   he is largely feigning a hard stance to placate his constituents . 
  cameron is a genuine eu federalist bullshit !, 
  saying it does n't make it so , cameron picked the wrong battle to fight this time . 
   if he appears weak on the eu it could propel farage in power , which would be bad for everyone . 
  since i would n't mind uk leaving the eu i do n't care about farage one way or the other . 
   besides , the eu is in need of some reform . 
  the eu has been constantly reforming for the last 20 years , what we actually need less of is less whining and blackmail from britain . 
  get in line or get out . 
  cameron is a fucking joke , he talks about `` reform '' but what he really means is `` give me more power !, 
   remember this is the election characterised by eurosceptic success . 
  the population at large is far less pro-eu than it has been . 
  so although the ep may well object to everything , it has a reputation it could do with not damaging . 
  they may well proceed in objecting to everyone except the withdrawn candidate ( who is at that point out of the race and therefore useless ) , but it may also come at a cost . 
  a perfect example of british ignorance , the eurosceptic `` success '' is a myth , while yes , in some countries , like the uk , where eu politics are next to toxic , eu sceptics managed to get vote in most countries eurosceptic parties were a massive flop . 
  get out of your bubble and smell the roses , almost nobody agrees with you and even those that are inclined to do so think cameron is out of his fucking mind . 
   the european council , to date , has also operated with consensus despite qmv being an option . 
  of course there 's always a first time for everything , though it would establish a very different mood within the council . 
  its tough to predict what that would be . 
  the ec operates on pragmatism and it 's become very clear that the ep will not vote for anyone but juncker , if the ec tries to push another candidate they will run into a wall in the ep . 
  none of the european leaders , except cameron want that , something that can be seen from their actions after the election . 
  i am at thing time 90 % sure that juncker will be nominated , simply because the ec has no option left to nominate somebody else and not be made a joke of by the ep . 
   on the contrary . 
  with juncker facing plenty of opposition , what mandate he had is reduced even more . 
  he has more of a reason to compromise as a result of what has happened than if nobody had objected to him . 
  you truly have no clue how politics work do you ? 
  you think making enemies of others is a way to get what you want ? 
  delusional . 
  it 's truly shocking how badly cameron fucked this up , how be painted himself into a corner and guaranteed that other eu leaders could n't help him even if he wanted to . 
  not only did he pick the wrong hill to make his stand on , but he made it in such a blackmail way that he guaranteed none of the others , even those that might be willing to listen , be caught dead next to him . 
  one thing is clear ... he should fire his advisers straight away and get new ones . 
  perhaps germany should come back and talk about this when they start building some nuclear reactors again . 
  our top three guesses for your english dialect : ? 
  south african 2 . 
  us black vernacular / ebonics 3 . 
  american ( standard ) our top three guesses for your native ( first ) language : ?

  we have ... awaken . 
  you 're trying too hard . 
  see hungarians ? 
  we were first !, 
  go back to russia !, 
  ... let the flame wars ... begin !, 
  nein , nein , herr refugee , you need to fill the form e102 , not e201 . 
  no , we do n't have it here . 
  try the office 2a . 
  their closed now . 
  horrid conditions ? 
  please . 
  at least they were not in danger of being beheaded , right ? 
  right ? 
  let 's not forget what a refugee should expect : shelter and security . 
  not pizza and villas . 
  i assume they were muslim migrants based on this :  `` in a suburb of stockholm yesterday they were confronted by a group who objected to them filming , '' this  objected to the 60 minutes team , including presenter liz hayes , filming and interviewing immigrants at rinkeby square . 
  and this  they told me that they were in somalia , syria and iraq , but nothing like that has just happened to them , they had never experienced [ this ] anywhere else . 
  this is one of the best post i 've read here !, 
  congratulations for you effort , english skills , attention to detail and professionalism . 
  you will do great in the future , i know you will . 
  the stories are true . 
  our internet is fabulous . 
  corruption can never be removed . 
  it can only be contained . 
  take your hands off her !, 
  she 's all ours !, 
  we waited too much time to meet someone like her ... our precioussssss, 
  that 's a bold move dave , let 's see how it will play out . 
  my guess : the refugees will finally break the police barricades in all the countries starting with macedonia and nobody will do shit . 
  the usual refugee flow will continue until the next saturation and daily quotas are imposed . 
  repeat until violence will remain the only option . 
   dna sent to court over 1,250 defendants for top - and medium-level corruption last year . 
  five times more ministers and members of the parliament were indicted last year , including former prime minister victor ponta , 5 ministers , 5 senators , and 16 members of the deputies chamber . 
  `` it 's the highest number of officials investigated by dna in a year , '' kovesi pointed out . 
  i love kovesi . 
  i am sorry you had to go through that !, 
  nobody should be forced to listen manele :(, 
  why ? 
  do you drink water , eat and shit too ? 
   i want free coffee :( looks like you need more german overlords . 
   man you are fucked up . 
  why man ? 
  i consider my life to be pretty averege . 
  i like it that way . 
   thanks for stealing jobs at german corporations i turrhk yur jerb !, 
   commuting is periodically recurring travel between one 's place of residence and place of work , or study , and in doing so exceed the boundary of their residential community . 
  i am exceeding the boundary of my residential community , i go past a forest to reach my workplace . 
  when going with my bike is quite nice . 
  does reddit count ? 
  neah man , i 'm good . 
  my family is my hobby . 
  he 's currently level 24 dota2 master and a colonel in cs : go . 
  well , you are most welcome to come and settle . 
  i , for one , hope that westerners will chose to come here for mutual benefit . 
  that 's some nice wishful thinking right there . 
  :( would someone think of the poor jihadists ? 
  ... wow , this sounds really bad . 
  for once , being an economically unattractive country pays off . 
  there are news everywhere here that our first batch of refugees are coming : all 15 of them . 
  not that shit again !, 
  whoa , relax dude !, 
  the winter will soon be over . 
  no , left guys . 
  i 'll see myself out . 
  i heard austria always wanted to have a port somewhere ... 
   i am not going to say you just said that . 
  for example : i 'm not going to say that you 're a moron , but 99 % of what you say is moronic . 
   banners with best of luck and let 's remain friends !, 
  do n't forget : `` no , no , it was n't you , it was me '' and `` i think we should see other people . '', 
  do n't try to find some masterplan on how the things are done here when you can blame everything on stupidity . 
  huh , that 's some interesting info . 
  til, 
  please do n't be on the list , please do n't be on the list , ... ah shit , we 're on the list . 
  cross the border and live with us . 
  we do n't have much but the media here is quite ... diverse . 
  also lots of internets . 
  wow , i always thought that he was a writer from the middle ages . 
  fuck , i 'm ignorant . 
  now you 're just throwing insults . 
   `` a direct link between the attack and the ypg has been established , '' davuto\u011flu said . 
  it had received logistical support from pkk militants inside turkish territory , he added . 
  but both the ypg and the pkk flatly deny responsibility . 
  the pyd leader , salim muslim , also said his group was not involved . 
   ** these denials , plus the speed , unusually detailed nature and alacrity of davuto\u011flu 's announcement ** , will raise questions about the thoroughness of the investigation , the accuracy of its findings and possible political motivations . 
  they were too quick on drawing conclusions . 
  that 's way too fishy . 
  where is the professional investigation on what happened ? 
  you just figure that mess out in one night ? 
  please . 
  only one army can defeat the russians . 
  the mongols . 
  but they are retired now . 
  it did . 
  see all replies . 
  declare war on the swiss . 
  surrender shortly and let them annex you . 
  what 's a gun ? 
  so what dacia is owned by the french ? 
  they are helping our economy big time , we have many more companies that provide for dacia + employment .

  especially since they have very little interests in ukraine as it is . 
   arguably , the uk would lose sovereignty in some areas ( fax diplomacy ) , but gain it in others ( free trade agreements ) . 
  perhaps he assigns more weight to one than the other ? 
  which is an absurd position to take . 
  giving up any and all control in many areas just so you can have the chance to negotiate fta 's outside the eu is chasing dreams , any fta britain could negotiate outside the eu would either be a bad deal or it could be a much better deal if negotiated through the eu . 
  when you 're negotiating the largest trading block in the world you can ask for certain concessions which you could n't if you 're just one single nation . 
  anyway you cut it , it 's simply bad policy . 
   i think it 's uncalled for because at the very least he is not one of those anti-eu zealots that rabidly criticize the eu at every turn , or throw up statistics constantly to show how the uk would be better off economically outside the eu . 
  that 's exactly the type he is . 
  if he limited his arguments to sovereignty , that 's an argument i could respect and understand , but he does n't , he comes up with these absurd theories about how the city will be so much better outside the eu because what i 'm guessing to be magic even in the thread of an article about the group that lobbies for the banks say a british exist would harm the city a lot . 
  another absurd idea of his was that it would somehow be better for britain to take a norway option , even though that means government by fax , because apparently it would be the same situation as now . 
  even though brussels bends over backwards and makes concessions to britain at every turn . 
  concessions that would n't exist with a norway options . 
  these are just a few points of the top of my head , there are surely more . 
  like i said at the start , if he limited his argument o sovereignty i 'd have absolutely no problem with it , i 'd still think it would be a very bad move by britain , but at least i could respect it . 
  well when you put it like that , i really do n't care . 
   perhaps you should take a minute and cool off before replying again . 
  i 'm actually quite chill , i think what you are taking as anger is actually my total lack of respect for him . 
  simply said respect is earned not given , and he has yet to earn mine , even though i have lost count in how many threads he and i went at it . 
  he at no point made an argument that i could respect , not agree with mind you , just respect . 
   i do have an objection to you writing `` fucking '' to me . 
  it is needlessly agressive . 
  you think there 's a difference between stupid and fucking stupid ? 
  the fact that you think is needlessly aggressive leaves me cold , i 'd have to care about what you think for it to matter . 
   i do n't think i did say something stupid well you did . 
   but i have no objection to you disagreeing with me on this . 
  oh thank god , i was worried that you would n't agree at first . 
   i still do n't get it . 
  you and i disagree . 
  i think you and i can be civil to each other , but you say things like `` please fo fuck yourself '' to me . 
  why is that ? 
  because you were being passive aggressive and i hate it when people do that . 
  if you do n't like it that i asked you if you were stupid , stop saying stupid things . 
  if you say something stupid , i will call you out on it . 
   what is the point at swearing at a stranger on the internet what is the point of swearing at anyone ever ? 
   just because they disagree with you ? 
  checks out !, 
  you really do n't get it . 
   is n't it better to be civil with people rather than agressive and insulting ? 
  it worked so well last time , do n't you think ? 
  wait ... how did that end again ? 
  let me guess , you 're a ron paul voter . 
   i 'm surprised i do n't see more support for it here . 
  clearly you do n't know what you 're talking about , if that surprises you . 
   please try and stay polite . 
  please go fuck yourself . 
   britain already has very limited scope to influence laws . 
  and that 's only britain 's fault , britain is the country that could potentially have the most soft power in the eu , the country with the most ability to change things it does n't like , but it lost that power because instead of leading and forming coalitions with like minded nations it only went after opt-outs and isolating itself . 
  britain 's lack of influence is a self inflicted wound . 
   the difference between this limited scope , and no influence , is not that large . 
   there may be a net benefit to britain by leaving as can have total control on trade that just takes place within the uk , or trade with nations outside the eea . 
  completely deluded . 
   if they are n't going to be any different , then i ca n't see what the downside is for the uk in not having a vote on them . 
  are you really that fucking stupid ? 
  if you are out of the eu you wo n't be able to influence what laws are passed or what those laws say , but you 'll have to apply them anyway . 
  if you stay in the eu you can work to change current laws or write new laws more to british interests . 
   different name , same difference ? 
  it 's the free movement of goods across borders . 
  or have i got that wrong ? 
  you are very wrong . 
   uk is of paramount importance as a trade partner to the eu . 
  umm ... no , it 's not . 
  delusional !, 
   eu will submit to international law and the recognition of democracy under any article 50 negotiation - so long as the uk join the eea it reduces the points of contention vastly . 
  it 's mind blowing to me that you 're proposing a norway option for britain , the reason for leaving the eu is to regain lost powers . 
  a norway option would lead to britain being governed by fax from brussels in many matters , just like norway is and paying the eu for it . 
  completely agree . 
  most brits are just ignorant of the subject and believe what the tabloids tell them to believe , nobody ever accused them of being well informed . 
  when the jobs start moving across the channel , that 's when it 's going to hurt . 
  who did n't see that one coming from miles away ? 
  it 's clear as daylight that britain in general and the city especially benefit a lot from eu membership . 
  you 'd have to be completely blind not to see that . 
  if britain leaves the eu most of the financial institutions in the city will move to frankfurt and paris in 5 years at most . 
  that 's because you think it 's about estonia , it 's not . 
  it 's about nato and especially us credibility to protect allies . 
  failure to defend estonia , or any nato member for that matter , would overnight turn us foreign policy to shit and reverse 70 years of precedent . 
  that is the part that the us ca n't afford , estonia would be besides the point . 
  yes it would . 
  if nato refused to defend estonia from russia it would mean the end of nato and a reversal of 70 years of us foreign policy . 
  there is no way that nato in general and the us especially would let that happen . 
  that 's pretty clear . 
   well , my russian friend tells me that the crimea has been russian for a long , long time . 
  the people who live there are russians who speak russian , with a minority of ukrainians . 
  it was transferred to ukraine only in 1954 , when ukraine was also a part of the soviet union . 
  completely irrelevant , crimea was part of the sovereign state of ukraine now , a thing accepted by russia when they signed the 1994 nuclear arms treaty . 
  now russia just up and annexed part of a sovereign country . 
   that 's a bit different from invading romania . 
  i do n't know what romania 's got to do with this . 
  that 's exactly it , you do n't know anything about anything yet you feel you can have a valid opinion about it . 
  if you do n't know anything why not keep quiet and learn about it . 
   and as i said in my comment , history may explain why various europeans are distrustful of the russian state . 
  but it does n't mean you have to hate russians . 
  who said anything about russian people ? 
  this has nothing to do with them , this is all about russia as a state and the various way that state expresses itself . 
   they 're not the only ones , in europe or america , who have ever engaged in annexations , are they ? 
  this is a very stupid argument , based on a logical fallacy from the `` tu quoque '' family . 
  just because many nations annexed other territories historically , does not justify russia doing it now . 
  that 's not even mentioning that in this part of europe russia is the only one that 's been doing it consistently for the last few hundred years . 
  perhaps it would be best for you to stop listening to your russian friend and start reading some history books before you open your mouth again . 
   that 's not the way it seems to me .

  and he 's just as corrupt as all our other politicians , because he 's german that do n't make him special . 
  `` slow/unpredictable roads '' i bet you think our roads are all potholes and shit . 
  a video for bucharest-brasov-bacau : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sf704vndwc see how the roads are for yourself , cause they ai n't a reason to not check out romania . 
  cause if you 'd just skip the road like that you should just rather get a flight to instanbul , then a flight to budapest and you can call the useless trip done . 
  i use the trains quite a lot and the interregio 's are fine . 
  i bet you barely use the trains and still talk shit, 
  i like the duster more, 
  romania in 2007 was in full economic boom , i doubt moldova achieved the wages of that time . 
  if and only if the eu managed to make a proper unified army , then sure , americans can leave . 
  but if not , hell no i do n't want the americans to leave . 
  atm nato is useless without the usa . 
  i 'd rather have it named `` the european federation '', 
  this fight on corruption intensified since about 2-3 years ago . 
  you ca n't really see much change in such a short time however many are getting arrested by the authorities . 
  it takes time, 
  romanian road trip with only castles and the people 's palace number 578 seriously , nothing special in this guide whatsoever , it 's been said by many other blogs, 
  that amount of butthurt is reaching dangerous levels , be careful, 
  hopefully the sailor is next, 
  i 'm sure you 're spewing all that bullshit in the comment after a lot of research about what our country produces and what research is done here , or what 's going on in our country . 
  what ? 
  only to be discriminated now by the countries that bitched about us . 
  what hypocrites, 
  the fuck do you mean sources ? 
  it 's pretty damn obvious just if you look at the whole balkans . 
  every country there is corrupt more or less , depending on how deep they were in the ottoman empire . 
  explain that genius . 
  and that 's even worse . 
  they were slaves and you also forced them to change their religion . 
  believe it or not , the ottomans were very corrupt , especially when it came to getting posts working for the state or getting chosen to lead a state . 
  a friend of a friend , a loyal underling , all kinds of stuff , but very rarely for their skills . 
  that mentality also became part of us after so many years of being under the ottomans . 
  then came the commies too which worsened it . 
  the fact that turkey took so long to develop properly even tho you guys had such a big and powerful empire in your history , and did n't get involved in the world wars , only proves that the mentality and corruption is to blame . 
  that 's a bunch of bullshit, 
  tl ; dr : imf good thing we 're gon na pay our remaining debts to those shitheads next year and then we can kick them out of here . 
  oh , alright then . 
  is n't bulgaria the only old eu member that is n't part of the esa ? 
  croatia is new , so obviously they 're just getting acquainted with the organization atm . 
  it 's already being fixed , in romania at least . 
  just wait for the gdp growth rate this year , i guarantee everyone will be surprised . 
  17 mil ? 
  pulling numbers out of your ass ai n't convincing anybody . 
  source please, 
  actually , no it ai n't worth the cost . 
  i think all the eurofighter crashes happened in spain, 
  so what 12 year old made this map ? 
  romanians would literally become the majority in hungary if that happens lol . 
  and then they 'd force hungary to unite with romania, 
  i like this map, 
  here 's a little tip that will be helpful in life . 
  borders can be crossed !, 
  gasp , amazing right ?? 
  in africa with a bit of money you can get through any border you want . 
  the whole continent knows about europe and thinks it 's some paradise or something . 
  and btw , if you bothered to read my posts , i never said they should be stopped to enter and be left to drown . 
  there are other solutions . 
  aw , do n't get mad now . 
  message me when you find that person , 
  what 's so wow about a romanian `` explaining '' about integration ? 
  and thanks for saying absolutely nothing of worth to explain what i said is wrong . 
  this `` big shock '' does n't convince me of anything . 
  `` most come from northern africa '' source please, 
  okay then , please tell me the reality of the africans coming from congo , ethiopia and all those wonderful countries . 
  which ? 
  turks or africans ? 
  no africans , but plenty turks made businesses in my city . 
  again people with bad comparisons . 
  african immigrants are not on the same level with turks . 
  turkey is a stable country , getting richer , where you can get a good education and learn a job . 
  the africans on these rickety boats are the kind from villages/cities where running water does n't exist and they have to survive day-by-day . 
  how do you expect to integrate those people in europe ? 
  do you ignore what i said or something ? 
  even in the ceascu times it still does n't compare with africa . 
  these people live in war-torn countries , absolutely failed states , 3rd world countries . 
  what jobs will they steal ? 
  the only things they will be able to do are physical jobs . 
  a very small part of them are actually educated enough to integrate in a european country . 
  the crime rates will go through the roof , maybe even worse than what our gy - roma do . 
  in what country do you live in ? 
  if you were a italian i bet you would n't talk like this . 
  but the thing is we ca n't just simply deny the boats access like that . 
  they usually come in rickety-ass boats and just the way to europe is risky enough , sending them back will leave them stranded in the ocean and they will not survive . 
  we got ta find a way to stop them close to the african shores , so the risk goes away . 
  it 's not a valid comparison at all . 
  most of these africans come from poor african countries , bad education if no education at all and they also will not come back to africa in any way , shape or form , they are desperate to leave . 
  they will stay in italy , or go to some other european country , but they will have a hard , very hard time to integrate . 
  romanians live in a stable country , they had nice childhoods , they were n't starving , they finished school , high school , a lot of the immigrants even one or two universities . 
  a lot of them go to work abroad for money , then they build themselves a nice home in romania , make a bit more money for spending , then go back . 
  oh there are solutions , inevitable worse ones than the one i said . 
  if the eu does n't take action , the italians will eventually snap when they keep getting wave after wave after wave of african immigrants . 
  and there we go , another mussolini/hitler/whatever is voted into power . 
  they wo n't dare go to war with europe . 
  but still , what else do you propose ? 
  i do n't see another `` humane '' way to tell them to fuck off , without leaving the boats stranded in the middle of the ocean and them all to die . 
  so guys , how about the eu sending frigates near the african continent and sending the boats back to the shore before they get too deep in the ocean ? 
  ... i do n't see the connection with what i said, 
  unqualified immigrants go where they can get money , they do n't really care about the language . 
  maybe they pick up on the language while they stay there , but i guarantee a lot of them do n't know much when they arrive . 
  maybe when we 're rich and have nothing better to spend money on , and start demolishing everything to rebuild the old buildings . 
  talk for yourself .

  and i am of the same opinion about my gypsy co-nationals flooding western europe not for lawful employment , but for petty crime . 
  you hungarian bros hurry up with that fence . 
  now please show me legal distinctions between private and personal property in the developed world . 
  there actually are , but they are pretty subtle because the line is getting more blurred by the day . 
  such is the nature of supply and demand economics ( aka . 
  what empirically works , as opposed to fantasy ) . 
  thanks for reminding me there are people in the developed world still arguing against private property . 
  i 'm sure you will be taken seriously if you ever attempt to elaborate legislation . 
  no worries , they are already brigading this thread . 
  you should n't be calling them 13 year old though , that 's pretty shit . 
  there is absolutely no chance a reddit thread on a minor subreddit will change greece 's situation for better or worse . 
  the communist elements in their parliament though - that is an issue . 
  let them . 
  let them crash and burn , for the whole world to see what happens when marxists are elected in governance . 
  europe will fall behind with more dead weight anyway . 
  in the unlikelihood that happens , i will only be sorry for the greek people , the general population , as i 'm sure they are more interested in their livelihoods than marxist dreams of utopia . 
  why do n't you make a better life for yourself then ? 
  read statistics about upwards social mobility , watch a shia labouf motivational video , realize you are a failure and only then you will be on the road of personal responsability and material achievement . 
  or you could continue being a failure and hoping a revolutionary utopia will hand you everything . 
  and do n't forget , if you fail , it 's not your fault . 
  you did everything right , to the best of your abilities . 
  the blame is on the banks \u2122 . 
  i could talk to you for a while about engel 's law of transformation , althusser 's hegemony , or a myriad of dialectic materialist concepts . 
  also i believe these marxist ideas have merit and applicability . 
  the problem is , you 're on reddit , and you will probably treat it as your religion . 
  no discourse can be had with such people , and i 've taken too many chances already . 
  people who use the word `` neoliberal '' generally have little education in finance , business , macroeconomy or law . 
  as a law student who will soon be part of a masters ' program at a faculty you probably heard of , i can assure you `` neoliberalism '' is a bit of a joke in academia . 
  people who whine about `` neoliberalism '' , employing pretty-colored infographs rather than documents and statistics are simply desperate . 
  desperate because they missed their chance at unrest since the economic crisis . 
  they are hanging onto every thread of financial misfortune in europe ( and the western world in general ) , because they realize most nations are returning to normal economic growth . 
  greece has been taken captive by such populists and their agendas . 
  and i 'm not talking of syriza at large and mr. tsipras whom i have respect for ( and believed in ) , just the extreme elements in their coalition - who destroyed the chance for a better deal for greece . 
  i could replace `` they '' with `` you '' but i 'd rather not be vindictive . 
  i 've met reasonable anarchists ( albeit few ) . 
  to people in r/socialism , if you simply believe in property ( an established human right ) , you will be classified as a right-wing nut . 
   anarchism are you of legal drinking age ? 
  it 's okay , we 've all had our phases . 
  have you people noticed the stuff that 's upvoted on / r/socialism ? 
  ( from the other top story about greece ) . 
  * '' & gt ; should the ~ ~ left platform ~ ~ greek people support tsipras and syriza in power - or ~ ~ vote against him and risk a `` coup '' by the reactionaries and put nd in power ? ~ ~ burn the old royal palace that contains parliament down with those idiots in it ? 
  '' * you can not reason with these people . 
  they are the reason the situation got much worse for the greek people in the past weeks . 
  it 's become quite clear that a reasonable leftist social democrat like mr. tsipras got held hostage by the extremist wing in his party ( skourletis and dragasakis , among others in the coalition ) . 
  and to what end ? 
  the insitutions ' trust in the greek government is at the lowest point , and this will not benefit the greek people . 
  yet , they want more of the same . 
  i 'm currently being brigaded by commies after an argument ( including comments in romanian that they ca n't understand ) so this will probably never be visible . 
  ** do not attempt to reason with marxists ** . 
  their worldview is similar to racism , men 's rights , modern feminism , political islam , islamophobia . 
  it 's not about the welfare of the society , `` the greater good '' or anything like that - it 's simply identity politics , of groups wanting to maintain their privileges or acquire more , leeching on others . 
  it is a sign of immaturity to believe in childish marxist revolutions ( speaking as someone who shares a lot of views with social democrats ) . 
  that kind of stuff ended in the 90s . 
  and this subreddit is pretty ideologically balanced . 
  see my other reply . 
  or just compare it with . . eww ... / r/politics or , at the other extreme , r/ukpolitics . 
  but they all pale in comparison to r/socialism , which is / r/conspiracy tier . 
  some people are saying this subreddit is `` right wing '' which honestly is pretty inaccurate . 
  as a rather centrist person who 's spent some time here , this to me seems like one of the most ideologically balanced large subreddits . 
  have you not noticed the shift from in what 's generally upvoted ? 
  when mr. tsipras rejected the ( much lighter ) eurogroup measures and proposed a referedum , the sway in what was upvoted was generally tending to be less sympathetic to the greek cause . 
  after mr. tsipras and his delegation suddenly showed themselves as willing to compromise ( probably finally facing the reality of what they would be facing on the background of the banking crisis ) , and the european instituions acted needlessly harsh in negotiations , most prevalent opinions here were empathetic towards the greek people . 
  i rather changed my view too . 
  ** most people would disagree , because they tend to always notice those who do n't share their worldview more stridently . 
  but really , the large proportion of the discussion here feels very reasonable and balanced , with extremist outliers , of course , like in every medium ever . . ** compare r/europe to ... ugh ... r/politics . 
  or if you prefer the other end of the spectrum , r/ukpolitics . 
  because that is the worst imaginable realistic scenario ? 
  everyone talking about the potential for growth on medium term in case of a grexit are only taking into consideration the most positive , rianbows-and-unicorns progressions of events possible . 
  you do n't need anything more than a skull that 's not empty to recognize that the statement `` greece will eventually go bankrupt '' is inane . 
  i would enlist if the baltics were threatened and open military conflict begun . 
  the problem today is that there is no balance , no middle ground between the fervor of nationalism and the complete apathy of overeducated youths . 
  we need loyalty to the institutions that defend us , such as nato . 
  the enemy possess that to a much larger extent . 
  ** `` first they came for the socialists , and i did not speak out ... '' **, 
  on tuesday ? 
  varoufakis + predictions makes for a great source of kek . 
  more marxist bullshit for simple minds . 
  now you can be mislead with easy to digest , pretty-colored infographics . 
  because who needs primary sources , or actually reading documents ? 
  shut up with this `` eventually greece will go bankrupt '' . 
  that is much closer to `` extremely unlikely '' than `` foregone conclusion '' . 
  i 'm tired of simple minded scrubs like you taking simplistic anti-stances ( either anti-greece or anti-europe ) to validate their worldview . 
  of course , without any knowledge of finance or macroeconomy . 
  no , the rest is not `` theater '' . 
  it 's the confrontation and/or collaboration of many different parties with many diverging interests ; the difference is , elected officials at eurogroup meetings are backed by or are themselves experts in these fields . 
  economy might be a fickle thing to predict ; though their insight and debates certainly outclass redditors ( and even american academics ) in applicability . 
  ** stop saying `` greece will eventually go bankrupt '' . 
  just stop . 
  repeating it , foaming at the mouth with anti-eu fervor will not make something that nobody wants to happen , happen . 
  ** i rather believed it too , for a few days , when the referendum was announced as i thought the marxist wing of syriza was holding the rest of the social democrats in the party hostage , though it does n't appear to be true to such an extent . 
  damage was still done though . 
  tsipras and greece by extension would have been in a much better negotiating position if they did n't give in to skourletis ' , dragasakis ' , etc dreams of imposing terms on europe without having much real leverage . 
  they still managed to secure a haircut , the new bailout is pretty large , the newly acquired debt is under negligible interest , and the privatization of assets , along with the fiscal reform ( i pray to god they manage to implement it ) have a realistic chance of putting greece on the right track .

  as long as we crucify creditors !,

that 's false , bohemia was elected and their ruler died in like a couple of months and they got re-elected after that . 
  allied a bunch of turks and gathered with half of europe to attack france , france is n't hurt a bit , england does n't exist and the great president of lubeck , the single greatest merchant republic in all of europe is now an elector in the holy roman empire . 
  long live our bohemian emperor . 
  great 20 years for lubeck , the single greatest merchant republic in europe . 
  many brave men have died in the danish conquest of the northern british archipelago , but after that 5 year war , our country entered a state of peaceful reconstruction . 
  many forts , marketplaces and shipyards were build , while also helping our great friends in denmark reconstruct their navies and armies . 
  our men also worked very hard on developing the great city of lubeck , which now stands as tall and beautiful as paris and frankfurt . 
  due to that , we managed to uncover the secrets of colonialism from our south-east asian friends and we shall spread this knowledge further with our danish and polish allies , but also with the entire northern german region , which now stands tall as a pillar of stability and friendship . 
  ( besides cologne who tried to annex frankfurt , got eaten and ragequit lol ) . 
  this is the president of lubeck , the single greatest merchant republic in the northern holy roman empire . 
  first off , the great european alliance lasted for about ... 10 days ? 
  most of the alliance , alongside the danish and hte muscovites declared war on our french leader . 
  lubeck took absolutely no part whatsoever , in no shape of form , in this war , because lubeck is peaceful and loyal to the ea . 
  anything else you hear is fake news . 
  after cheeky diplomacy from the french side ( the war leader fucking dc 'd lol ) , europe looked like it was at peace again . 
  well , except the iberian peninsula being conquered by granada and its muslim allies . 
  but we know europe is never at peace . 
  with the help of denmark , lubeck expanded its borders once more , this time on brandenburgian clay . 
  during this war , brandenburg lost most of its provinces to denmark and lubeck , after losing some to poland , now sitting on only 2 . 
  also , hesse has been liberated from its brandenburgian subjugators , only to be conquered by our friends in cologne . 
  with the great muslim invasion against france , what will happen in our turmoil-filled continent ? 
  whose backs will be stabbed again ? 
  can europe stand against the foreign invaders and can europe match the asians in the great colonialism race ? 
  how do you do these maps ? 
  dear brunswick , sorry . 
  - lubeck, 
  \\ #freefrankfurt ? 
  the great merchant republic of lubeck stayed away from the absolute clusterfuck that was the crusade on the austrian-ottoman alliance . 
  we instead focused on helping our neighbors in their own wars , helping brunswick conquer a province from hamburg , and denmark conquer east frisia . 
  for our help and through diplomacy , we received the province of hamburg and we have also secured alliances with denmark , brunswick and brandenburg , ensuring peace between these powers in the northern hre , to the benefit of us all .

  your majesty !, 
  you will be thrilled to hear that , in your absence , your great kingdom has taken the decision to ally with the merchant republic of lubeck !, 
  i hope your intimidating military force and our financial support will manage to keep foreign invaders at bay and help maintain the well being of the holy roman empire citizens . 
  the great republic of lubeck is pursuing its peaceful ways of increasing income and maintaining the well-being of its citizens . 
  after a swift war against saxe-lauenburg , our republic grew in size , adding lauenburg to its peaceful lands . 
  after securing an alliance with the great kingdom of brandenburg , our republic shall strive to make a better living for all citizens inside and outside it . 
  after some efforts to increase development and trade income , the republic of lubeck will gladly offer financial help to any country that might need it for a good cause , as it is in our best interest to keep the world a peaceful place , where all men can thrive . 
  oh yeah man , the coalition map mode around you was a fucking mess this session .

  the maharajah tried to make some deals this session , caused some weird shit to happen , but in the meanwhile united all of southern india and brought the former nation of pegu under our glorious maharajah . 
  we have also created the single most beautiful province in the world in golconda , which now sits at 43 development . 
  through it , we have brought colonialism to the indian lands .

  year 1499 , [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kz2hxmm.png ) of the world . 
  the maharajah of the great kingdom of vijayanagar is ... confused ? 
  our friends in the north turned on each other , with the sultanates of delhi and malwa allying with the timurid horde and destroying the sultanate of jaunpur . 
  but since we are still in good relations with our friends in malwa , both the sultan and the maharajah knowing that tolerance is the way , our kingdom is prospering . 
  we have built a pretty grand fleet , developed our cities with various improvements and buildings , solidified our defensive fort allignment , and sent the first brave men to colonize empty islands around us . 
  what was once the great sultanate of bahmanis is now gone , as is ~ ~ the sultanate of ~ ~ orissa . 
  ceylon and southern india will soon be united under one maharajah , while we all look towards the future , whatever other weird ass shit might happen in that future . 
  europe 's still a shithole . 
  the maharajah of vijayanagar is pleased . 
  got another chunk of bahmanis and i 'm close to uniting southern india . 
  after that , we will be looking to the future of our country , where our maharajah will rule over all the dravidian people . 
  also got great power for a while , but then muscovy embraced renaissance . 
  oh , no , i meant our friends that are expanding . 
  oman is great friend . 
  just did n't realize you already took yemen . 
  this is the maharajah of vijayanagar . 
  europe is comprised of a bunch of uncivilized peasants that fight pointless wars . 
  meanwhile , india is the only region of actual intelligent rulers that fought good wars where everyone actually gained something . 
  bahmanis and bengal are broken , the savage timurid horde has been held back and we are continuously expanding alongside our friends in jaunpur and malwa * ( and oman ) * . 
  india is civilized .

  highlight of the session : the great world war ... in which lubeck did not participate . 
  technically . 
  well it kind of did since some prussian and swedish mercenaries were paid with lubeck cash , but . 
  the war pitted together  malaya , france and all his subjects ( including castille and kongo ) , italy , ethiopia , the mughal empire , bukhara and his subjects vs.  netherlands , great britain , sweden , prussia , with polish condottieris . 
  i 've gathered some highlights from the sidelines [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/r55ik ) . 
  in the end , malaya 's side stood strong after netherlands ' surrender and took overseas territories . 
  after that , we conquered oldenburg and bremen from hannover , not too much of note there . 
  however , our republic now sits in third place in a ranking of nations with highest incomes , after the mughal and malayan giants , and we can still only go up from here .

  just because the slavic element assimilated the others does not mean that they all are descendant of invaders , as you so simplistically put it . 
  just like greeks are descendant not only from the greek invaders , but also from the local populations , like the minoans and whatever , that they mixed with . 
  hey , i though we were the poorest !, 
  you would n't believe how many nations have silly stories like this . 
  and i agree that macedonian history is full of silly things , but the sooner people leave them alone , the sooner they outgrow these myths by themselves . 
  now , being under attack , they rally around this false history . 
  everybody needs to chill the fuck out . 
   to make it up let me show you the only two words i learned from my trip to bucuresti : pofta buna . 
  just in time . 
  i 'm off to eat , 
   at least now they have a legitimate ** region ** to hate bulgarians freudian slip ? 
  yeah man . 
  and we should totally call greece \u201e new greece '' , not to confuse it with pederastic \u201e old greece '' , or bulgaria \u201e slavic bulgaria '' , to differentiate it from the non-slavic bulgars that invaded modern day bulgaria , but were turkicn not slavic , like the balkars in the caucasus , who are probably another branch of the turkic bulgars of old . 
  and the nerve on azerbaidjan , not calling itself \u201e north azerbaidjan '' . 
  iran must be terrified that they might have territorial claims towards the iranian province of azerbaidjan . 
   examples that do n't match ? 
  no analogy is perfect . 
   you obviously have n't heard some of the stuff they 're saying . 
  who ` se `` they '' . 
  the state or the people ? 
   some even claim that all white people come from macedonians . 
  some romanians [ do too ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protochronism ) , or think that the latins descended from the dacians . 
  a lot of greeks think \u201e everything comes from the greeks '' because a lot of words used today internationally have greek etymologies . 
  yeah , modern greeks totally share the culture of the ancient greeks . 
  i mean pederasty and polytheism is just as rampant as it was 2000 years ago . 
  and do n't even get me started on country names . 
  modern ghana does not overlap with medieval ghana in any way , benin has zero connection with the benin empire , mauretania is named after a kingdom that existed much more to the north , cambodia is named after a state in india and there was no such thing as a \u201e pakistani '' identity before the middle of the 20th century . 
  they were indians . 
  there is no distinction between moldavia and moldova in the romanian language . 
  we just call one \u201e our moldova '' and the other \u201e republic of moldova '' , \u201e moldova from beyond the prut ( river ) '', 
   macedonians did n't exist back then all national identities are ideological creations starting from around the middle of the 19th century . 
  also , had we not joined together , we could have blocked bulgaria over the [ asan dinasty ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asanesti#origins ) that ruled the second bulgarian empire, 
  claiming copyright on history is equally stupid . 
  and if one can be greek and slavic at the same time ( as [ slavophone greeks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavophone_greeks ) seem to proove ) , one can be macedonian and slav . 
  and in case you have n't noticed , the french have a germanic ethnonim , and the bulgarians have a turkic one . 
  actually , gheorghe doja is acnowledged as a szekely , not an ethnic romanian , but history focuses on the social aspects ( the people vs the upper class ) of his fight , not the ethnic ones . 
  but moromete 's origins were unknown to me . 
  good one  also , dimitrie cantemir is claimed by the romanians , the russians , the turks ( cantemiroglu ) and probably the moldovans too . 
  yeah , because greece is acting like a child, 
  the area of moldova is now part of 3 countries : republic of moldova , romania and ukraine . 
  only 1 uses the name . 
  the area of luxemburg is divided between the grand duchy of luxembourg and the belgian province of luxembourg . 
  as a romanian , i can confirm that matthias corvinus , the greatest king of hungary ( if i 'm not mistaken ) is also claimed by romania , together with his father , john hunyady, 
  silvio , business as usual, 
  hello my fellow bihoranian !, 
  they also might be related to the [ t\u0103rt\u0103ria tablets ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tartaria_tablets ) and the [ vinca script ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vin%c4%8da_signs ) . 
  man this is exciting . 
  there is a difference between \u201e having a language '' and \u201e having writing '' . 
  think about it . 
  i agree that it 's about many factors , not just the electoral system, 
   and what about mr. putin ? 
  russia is generally considered an authoritarian state , not a full blown dictatorship, 
  did n't france use proportional representation about 10 years ago , then everybody freaked out that the front national got a lot of seats , and switched back to the old system ? 
  i do n't know about that . 
  it 's known that a fptp system moves the political landscape towards a 2 party system , while a list system , like in the netherlands or israel favours political fragmanteation ( 5-6-whatever no . 
  of parties ) . 
  so it 's more than just the electorate . 
  come on . 
  the vatican is a weird fucking state . 
  it 's more of a corporation hq that got recognized as an independent state . 
  does it even have an actual population . 
  like civilians , or is it just clergy walkin around ? 
  while this is true , eastern europe is a bit more to the right than western europe ( due to recent history ) . 
  we are scared of the extreme left , while they are more scared of the extreme right . 
  he 's portuguese ( if i remember corectly ) , but with a chinese flair, 
  to be fair , polling only north-western europe makes this poll a bit problematic . 
  eastern europe would probably have given a few extra points to romney . 
   the democracy is defined by the constitution , but who defends the constitution ? 
  the million dollar question in any democracy . 
  i do n't know . 
  who defends it in germany , switzerland , poland , italy or the us ? 
   if the military is conscripted by the people how is it \u201e conscripted * by * the people '' ? 
   the turkish military has defended the republic many times and turkey is no military dictatorship . 
  it has been at times . 
  and that in itself makes this system highly debatable . 
  see : http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/11/24/the_historical_blindness_of_turkeys_detractors?page=full  in my country , the king is supposed to defend the constitution and he is the leader of the armed forces and the church . 
  yeah , but the monarchy is not really a shinning example of a democratic institution . 
  i 'm a fan of \u201e byzantium '' myself, 
  somewhat ontopic , there was [ an interesting article in the bbc ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/8675063.stm ) when coalition negociations were going on in the uk and i found it interesting how much anxiety that period of uncertainty produced in the british public and media . 
  i always get the feeling that at least part of the hate towards nick clegg is because his electorate , not used to coalitions , had too big expectations of him . 
  actually , i think most european states have a negative view of the millitary having any say in politics . 
  so erdogan might be right on this one . 
   if democratically elected ( like hitler ) then the burden lies to the entire state regardless who they voted for . 
  1 . the nsdap never received a majority of votes until after hitler was already named chancelor by hindemburg . 
  therefore it 's debateable if hitler was \u201e democratically elected '' 2 . 
  the burden may lie on \u201e the state '' , but \u201e the state '' is not synonymous with \u201e the population '' . 
   btw check what i found : you found revisionist history . 
  i 'm not even going to bother watching it . 
  interesting . 
  maybe lwow should have been included in post ww2 poland . 
  anyway , i can see an interesting parallel with transylvania . 
  in 1918/1920 when it became incorporated into romania , all nearly its major cities were inhabited by hungarians , and it was a historically extremely important part of the kingdom of hungary . 
  on the other hand , most of the population was romanian . 
  most major cities became romanian-majority in the 60s and 70s . 
  t\u00e2rgu mure\u0219 is still 50/50 , with the romanians achieving a slight majority in 2002 . 
  to be fair , you were n't the majority there to begin with , so the analogy breaks down a bit http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/poland1937linguistic.jpg, 
   i suppose that since germany started the war this is a form of justice . 
  so ethnic cleansing against civilians is ok , if the state fucked up ? 
  so , let 's say that if golden dawn gets in power in greece and they start a war with tukey , then turkey can ethnically cleanse western thrace of greeks , regardless of the fact that not everybody there is a neo-nazi ? 
   the expulsions of the germans were ( from what i gather ) largely peaceful , not a genocide ( like the armenian genocide ) yeah , ethnic cleansing is a-ok if it 's not accompanied by genocide .

  yep . 
  they are members of a institution that has rules one of which is how to dress . 
  it 's not the same thing ...

  h : baby i want you so much !,

  h : oh yes you are !!!!, 
  after 5 mins ... h : thank you baby u are the best !!!, 
  nighty night !, 
  wtf is this ... 
  this is not the idea but people do n't know how to express it properly . 
  if shit were to hit the fan i guess no one would doubt that germany , france and uk wo n't get involved actively . 
  even is some politicians would be somehow reluctant i am sure the military has also his way to persuade a call to action . 
  the problem is that you give mixt signals , when it 's better just to keep the bluff up . 
  the idea is that a strong bluff strategy minimize the risk of smth happening . 
  so it 's better to prevent than to provide reactive actions . 
  if top dogs continue to mingle on this subject some heads in kremlin might get ideas . 
  personally i despise politicians that do such thing because they usually do it just to pray on peoples natural fear of war during peace times and get votes . 
  as long as ankara does n't furthers it 's belly dancing performance for putin , romania wo n't veto . 
  yep that also , considering rent and associated utilities and services especially, 
  those green ass holders are tremendously cute lol  ), 
  lol this is the new trend ... every medal for europe :d, 
  it also happened in tennis ( men ) when mergea / tecau beat the brazilian pair ( semi finals vs. melo-soares ) ... the public was obscene for a tennis match ... i think they are mistaking other sports for the local football/soccer field ... 
   it is better if we hire them to clean the streets , tend public gardens , work on the railroads but they wo n't do those jobs because they find them humiliating . 
  those jobs in we are usually for migrants either from ee or africa/me . 
  u saying that work taxes are more than 100 % of income ?!!, 
  if people found out about it then it 's definitely not true ... those warheads are better of in fort greely or guam lol . 
  maybe but why not putting them to work . 
  for example of u have a camp for around 50 - 100 ha . 
  but instead of using tents , put them to work in constructions , which is still very labor intensive and it does n't require a degree for most of it , and a lot of people already have a background in it . 
  put them to work for creating the infrastructure for their housing district . 
  pay them let 's say a decent minimum wage , while automatically put them in them to contribute to the social security system since they are employees . 
  it will surely cost more , but most money will go domestically ( the money for the materials will go to domestic companies ) , and the infrastructure will remain . 
  housing , schools , hospital and very very important police ( with translators ) !!!, 
  atm those camps are not policed as the rest of us are !, 
  this will also help start to differentiate them who is who , who knows what etc. 
  those people for better or worse do n't come from the jungle , they schooled . 
  we need a constructive way and time to do a triage of the refugees ... ( also indexing , we need to index people , biometrially , prints , iris , dental record , dna ), 
  those guys are crazzzzzy !!, 
  good references  ), 
  not sure if all eu countries have an inheritance tax . 
  rom\u00e2nia does n't have one for example . 
  i was explaining what he was implying plain and straight . 
  historically i think we can find english backstabbing , but from wwi onward they were always there when needed . 
  politically i could say it that uk did n't show fair play , they should have never tried to enter the 1st place in eu , should have stayed in the commercial agreement as a good sport ( as other non eu countries are ) . 
  they have always known that eu is trying sooner or later some sort of federalization and the uk would have never accepted this , and they always tried to block this process by any means , always were the special child . 
  my point of view was the second paragraph , it 's not about the purpose of the meeting , it 's how it is perceived . 
  a lot of compliments and goodwill displayed towards a country such as russia . 
  imo britain went there in a position of weakness . 
  a more reserved position might have been more appropriate . 
  i am afraid that the next title will be smth like : romania helps isis kill our children ... 
  would a tsunami help ? 
  ready to rally in the streets , ciolo\u0219 is life ciolo\u0219 is hope ciolo\u0219 is freedom ... also the 6pc has some structural flaws . 
  it 's based on a overheated economy and on a consume based on loans and imports ... 
  if a crisis would hit us we would sink to - in a blink ... 
  \u00cen europe ( britanic ai n't \u00een europe anymore ) most education is either cheap or free . 
  the only cost is the cost of living in the city where the university is located . 
  depends it 's possible that in the cases where europe had more than 1 athlete on the podium , if it participated as on3 country , we would have lost the lower positions since for each competition there is a limited number of athletes from a single country . 
  well it 's political cleansing . 
  the communists did it , the army did it also in the 80s now it 's erdogan 's turn to shine . 
  give the man a bud for dedication to the holy cause , and on a personal note they did try to assassinate him , shame on them for failing ... / s, 
  ok then just let them continue radicalization ... 
  since we ca n't do anything about it ... also you may like it or not , but not everything is on the same level . 
  debating if we should consider someone can kidnap a woman , lock her up , drug her and rape her repeatably cause this is what sexual slavery is , is not the same as debating who should we help out . 
  i am not being a hypocrit since sexual slavery is a real thing from east to west especially on prostitution rings but at least we have a stand towards it , and police tries its best ... 
  but letting someone endorsing this shit is both immoral , non pragmatic and stupid . . 
  indeed this is true put them together in real life situations and a time u will get a bunch ready to die for each other . 
  have to say this move is indeed progressive to the point it makes my heart tremble with enthusiasm because of the signal it sends . 
  on the other hand ee countries will have another problem they might be loose important personal that would want to go join the german army for better pay and better training experience with more modern equipment . 
  basically the problem we might have with health personnel might migrate to qualified army personnel ... 
  it 's voluntary ... 
  2 % maybe but on whose money ? 
  anyone agrees that local corruption and non reforms are more to blame than eu set up , germany and romanian emigrants ? 
  my italian bosses have learnt romanian fairly easy while their english is so baaaad ... 
  eu 's and south 's fault ... 
  some consider japonese school swimsuits dangerously appealing , 
  from what i saw they have low consideration for women . 
  we might be misogynists up to a point , but often comes the point were we became slaves  ) . 
  finally an approach towards gender equality : tits or gtfo !, 
  as we walk shirtless so should women ... 
  yeah you could buy in a rentable area . 
  tbh if i 'd have the start up money i 'd buy an apartment in bucharest just to rent it while still living on rent . 
  [ for example ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/26/city-of-london-expecting-further-post-brexit-losses-when-trade-reopens ), 
  in the way that they will back stab anyone and any principle as long as it suit their interest . 
  personally i wound n't go that far , but the message they send is not a positive one . 
  it looks the same as when tsipras and orban went to putin , to get personal help while promising to further russian agenda . 
  i think that london needs russian capital as a way to balance the effects of brexit . 
  some companies already said they would move to frankfurt capital market once britain is out of europe ... but it 's just speculation . 
  also it is important to know which richholes are backing up may ... 
  yes but slavery is illegal in europe and against a constitutional right ( oh yes brits don \\ t have one ) , so advocating and inciting people towards something which is illegal is also punishable by law . 
  it 's like i 'll go in the trafalgar square and start saying we should enslave jews ... in 20 mins ill have 10 cops on top me and be up the judiciary system 's ars .

  because they are bad at managing their own economy . 
  after each bailout it got worse . 
  they requested each bailout . 
  they should have recovered long ago . 
  almost every other country already has . 
  greece and spain are pretty much the only countries in the eu that are doing poorly economically . 
  saying that that 's because of the eu is false because every other eu member has a steady and positive growth rate . 
  you 're generalizing intentionally in order to push your anti eu agenda . 
  those are monthly values that fluctuate heavily . 
  the us had 0.8 % growth in the summer of 2016 . 
  the [ annual values ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/country-list/gdp-annual-growth-rate ) are more relevant . 
  united states 2.00 euro area 1.70 here 's the [ graph ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/european-union/gdp-annual-growth-rate ) for the annual gdp growth rate for the eu . 
  the [ ** forecast for the us ** ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth-annual/forecast ) is less optimistic , showing ** a decline in growth ** . 
  the [ ** forecast for germany ** ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/gdp-growth-annual/forecast ) is more optimistic , showing ** a slow but steady increase in growth ** . 
  the [ ** forecast for italy ** ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/italy/gdp-growth-annual/forecast ) is even more optimistic , showing ** a steady increase in growth ** . 
  the same optimistic trend is true for most eu countries . 
  even [ greece ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp-growth-annual/forecast ) is expected to recover at some point . 
  they 're already doing better than previous years . 
   europe in general is experiencing terribly sluggish growth . 
  you 're one of those guys that complains about everything , are n't you ? 
  `` europe economy is growing but it 's not growing fast enough . '', 
  really ? 
   globally , the european union was outpaced four-fold ( ! ), 
  by the united states got some sources for that ? 
  outpaced in what ? 
  outpaced when ? 
  says who ? 
  you ? 
  you 'll have to do better that than . 
   unfortunately , other countries do n't fare so well , but what do the germans care about those territories ? 
  how about france , italy , the netherlands and others ? 
  pretty much only spain and greece are failing . 
  is the eu geared towards making everyone rich except for spain and greece ? 
  have you considered that spain and greece maybe are n't good at managing their own economy ? 
  but that ca n't be , right ? 
  it truly must be someone else 's fault . 
   three years ? 
  in most of the world the recovery 's been going on for a bit longer than that . 
  read the article i posted . 
   ** germany has been running a surplus for three years . 
  first of all , [ all countries contribute money as well as receiving money ] ( http://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/romania_en ) . 
  some get more than others because that 's how the eu works . 
  the goal is to have all members on the same playing field . 
  all contributions are relative to each country 's gdp . 
  some countries make more money than others . 
  this has always been true . 
  the eu is one big party where everyone brings food and drinks . 
  and it would be highly unfair to expect champagne from the guy that came in on a bike just because the guy in the limo could afford it . 
  ** there are also other financial contributions and gains besides the direct ones . 
  ** people always omit this aspect and oversimplify a very complex issue . 
  ** free movement goes both ways . 
  ** ** cheap work force ** , including specialized workers , have long been a big `` import '' of the uk from eastern europe . 
  this actually includes uk companies that have offices in eastern europe and profit highly from the cheap labor while exporting goods and services all over europe . 
  most of that profit goes back to the company hq in the uk . 
  there are plenty other strategic and diplomatic aspects that are being ignored . 
  eu membership is a mutual benefit for all members . 
  the uk [ made more money from free trade and cheap labor ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/brexit-latest-cost-uk-leaving-eu-without-trade-deal-exports-negotiations-david-davis-a7325326.html ) than it [ directly contributed to the eu budget ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/how-much-do-we-spend-on-the-eu-and-what-else-could-it-pay-for/ ) . 
   in 2015 , that rebate reduced our contribution to ** # 12.9 billion ** . 
   total eu spending in the uk : ** [ $ 7.458 billion ] ( http://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/unitedkingdom_en ) **  an analysis by the independent of official data suggests british exporters would face a cost of at least ** # 4.5 bn ** - and ** in all likelihood they would take a hit many times larger ** and that only covers direct contributions , direct eu spending in the uk and estimated trade deal profit losses . 
  the hit will be much larger since companies are already relocating assets to other parts of europe . 
  and this only covers the financial aspect of things . 
  people will have to get visas in order to travel . 
  businesses and tourism will take a huge hit from this alone . 
  ** those that say that the uk is giving more than it 's receiving from the eu have a very limited point of view . 
  [ 2008 -- 16 spanish financial crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%e2%80%9316_spanish_financial_crisis )  the 2008 -- present spanish financial crisis , also known as the great recession in spain or the great spanish depression began in 2008 during the world [ financial crisis of 2007 -- 08 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/financial_crisis_of_2007%e2%80%932008 ) . 
   the results of the crisis were devastating for spain , including a strong economic downturn , a severe increase in unemployment , and bankruptcies of major companies . 
  [ greek government-debt crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_government-debt_crisis )  the greek government-debt crisis ( also known as the greek depression ) is the sovereign debt crisis faced by greece in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007 -- 08 . 
   the greek crisis started in late 2009 , triggered by the turmoil of the [ great recession ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_recession ) , structural weaknesses in the greek economy , and revelations that previous data on government debt levels and deficits had been undercounted by the greek government . 
  [ the latest polls show most people think brexit was a mistake . 
  this could be a turning point ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-poll-times-yougov-mistake-theresa-may-labour-corbyn-election-turning-point-a7705301.html ) denial , anger , bargaining , depression and acceptance are the 5 stages of grief . 
  this is a discussion about how the uk views brexit and all that relates to it . 
  ** how has brexit affected your life and what do you think about it ? 
  1 - there are lots of people claiming that the uk does n't want free trade with the eu . 
  [ britain gambles on free trade deal with europe ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/17/news/economy/theresa-may-brexit-speech-trade/ )  may says she wants the '' ** freest possible trade ** in goods and services '' between the two , but eu leaders have made it clear that brexit britain ca n't have the same access to markets it enjoyed as an eu member . 
  2 - free trade can not happen without freedom of movement . 
  [ juncker tells uk : no single market without freedom of movement ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/news/juncker-tells-uk-no-single-market-without-freedom-of-movement/ )  he said the eu would not grant ** tariff-free ** access to the internal market for uk goods and services if britain did not accept free movement of workers from within the eu . 
  3 - after being confronted with these facts some people may claim that countries like canada already have free trade with the eu without having freedom of movement with the eu . 
  this is false . 
  ceta also involves freedom of movement . 
  here 's the official [ ceta ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf ) document . 
  read chapter 10.1 about '' ** temporary entry and stay of natural persons for business purposes ** '' below from chapter 10.3  each party shall allow temporary entry to natural persons for business purposes of the other party who otherwise complies with the party 's immigration measures applicable to temporary entry , in accordance with this chapter . 
  4 - at this point the debate may revolve around the definition of `` freedom of movement '' and pointing out that eu states allow for permanent residence and therefore what canada has is not free movement . 
  there is no singular form of freedom of movement within the eu . 
  it varies from one eu state to the next because the conditions depend on local immigration laws . 
  canda is also not an eu state . 
  ceta is a separately negotiated agreement . 
  ceta 's free trade is not the same as the one from within the eu . 
  the same goes for freedom of movement . 
  ** the point here is that free trade involves freedom of movement of the same degree . 
  ** thanks for reading . 
  someone is having fun on [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_unionist_party ) ? 
   the democratic unionist party ( dup ) is the largest shower of cunts in westminister and the third-largest in northern ireland . 
  founded by ian paisley after fucking a badger paved into a gypsy tarmac , it is the largest incident of mass suicide in northern ireland 's history following the rape and murder of theresa may 's youngest son , actor and comedian pope francis . 
  a [ print-screen ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pqwvpyl.png ) for future reference . 
  the last [ official report ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2017/april/tradoc_155506.pdf ) from the eu - japan free trade talks also addresses freedom of movement . 
   the last outstanding issues of the text on ** entry and temporary stay of natural persons ** were also discussed . 
  although there are still no details , this is looking more and more like ceta . 
  people from canada and the eu can enter and temporary stay in the other country/region as long as they have a job there . 
  lots of people wrongfully use ceta and the new eu - japan trade deal negotiations as examples for the idea that free trade can happen without freedom of movement . 
  it ca n't .

  this is not democratic , this is downright plutocratic . 
  and more centralised power added to this system is very dangerous . 
  the public sector is a money pitt , the more money you trow at it the more it will take witout actually improving . 
  so is europe ready to put it 's money where it 's anti russian mouth is ? 
  more weapons are not the answer , more reason is . 
  i think the world wo n't get by . 
  you break international agreements and national sovereignty with impunity as it is , a isolated us is really horrifing, 
  i think the dutch will win spains group , and force them to play brasil i do n't see uruguay getting out of england and italy 's group . 
  ( i am a fan of itally so i am really biassed on this one )  belgium , chile , england . 
  i really doubt we 'll get far . 
  absolutely agree and i would add bosnia here too , chile has a almost imposible job . 
  i think belgium will win it 's group , but that will make her play against portugal which is a kind of end game . 
  ( it will be however the first game where portugal will play seriously ) if they do n't muck it up in the group stage ( agaist uruguay and itally ) they will have a easy ride up until the quarter finals , and if they do n't crumble by the pressure they have a change to take hollands place ( all in all it looks really good for england ), 
  better we not stray to far from us interest , the us without european moderation is very dangerous, 
  no they do n't they are a prety shitty team until key players strart to give a shit . 
  i am prety certain that these will be top 4 , maybe argentina can overcome portugal , but the portugeese do n't play fair in the advance stages . 
  it 's irrelevant , but there is no reason for it to not exist . 
  it would actually make a lot of sense if they would become a independent entity and the us would be a simple member . 
  all of the above . 
  yes betting is the flavor , especially in the balanced games . 
  germany will win it , portugal reaches the final , and brasil will take the small final against holland, 
  capitalism , we reduce life to numbers . 
  the model of represion was stalinist , as the population 's discotent grew he just aplied more pressure durring the 80s . 
  independece in regard to foreign policy and diplomacy , internally each country self managed and with the exception of hungary , poland a czechoslovakia did n't realy stray from the soviet model -, 
  define politics for me it is the art of staying in power , the end goal of a politician is to stay in power not actually changing things for the better . 
  also , every system is rigid to change , change is dreadful and the one that tries it will encounter resistance and protest at every turn , after a lot of criticism even the most neutral voter will believe the critics . 
  i would prefer a technocrat because consensus should be more important than actual change at the eu level . 
  it should not become a more distant supranational government . 
  i am an absolute egalitarian , if a man is a asshole he deserves the punch , if the woman is a asshole she deserves the punch . 
  omfg !, 
  that is crazy , i completely agree with the policy but the sexist nuace is horrifing . 
  if anything the prison system is letting the men down and efforts should be made for their rehabilitation , due to the higher rates of reoffence and if we are starting from the presumption of gender equality . 
  never been to prison , but they are more mandatory shelters , compared to the horrible abuses that existed in comunist prisons they are ok . 
  i did notice women inmates doing more city landscaping jobs than men which are in general working on highways . 
  and you could argue that they would be easier jobs , but the differences are just in line with gender preferences . 
  so is it ciclical ? 
  more funding results in lower reoffending rates which in term generates more funding ? 
  or why the difference in financing ? 
  is it really correlated to the percentage of the prison population or are there other factors like rehabilitation rate , smaller chance of being repeat ofendors , fewer female facilieties or just having more kids in care on average ? 
  in general laws have at least some sort of logical pretence ? 
  i think we have a divergent view on the human condition , society is just a facilitator of human interactions , it is not essential and in the long term it is useless . 
  a monarch has no natural legitimacy to impose or expect standards just like any other government for each individuals condition and context determines what is right and what is wrong . 
  that can be inforced my a more tight nit society but the general entroby of society is continously increasing you can not bring the individuality down just because you wish it so . 
  also power will fundamentally be abused the only difference is that within a monarchy the lack of a actual threat or finality will make the abuses less urgent , however a rulling class always takes it 's piece of the pie , morality is just a pretext for seeking power , power by its self is the motive . 
  and even if the rulling class is honorable as it 's interest is in preserving and imporving the country , the people closer to them have other concerns as their position is transitory and like all men our rulers will still be vulnerable to the soft words of a friend , lover or neighbour . 
  the advantage of monarchy on society , all being very anecdotal as monarchies are products of their time rather than actual independent case studies in national organisation , are far outweighed by the problems caused by the frailty of the human spirit ( we are not intrinsically moral and honor is just a myth told to lesser men , that can not really think independently , to aspire to and be on their best behavior , we can not see the future or predict complex outcomes , in short none of us are fit to rule ) combined with the the lack of accountability and permanency . 
  due to the sacrificial nature of election the rotation rate is high , some stay longer others less , but the long term result is that you get an average , not great rulers nor horrible , and if you acount for paradigm shifts and revolutions , then you get representatives that are reasonably in lign with the people they serve . 
  and yes they serve , because only due to consensus they have any power and autority . 
  you think this time european morals will have a longer experation date than after the georgian war ? 
  that is so cute . 
  at best you want it to be a federal authority , that is done by reducing dissent among members not by adding a legislative layer , a arena for new political conflict detached from actual issues . 
  a elected official gives false legitimacy to a supranational identity , and from the point of view of ones competence being elected does n't make you more capable than being anointed by god . 
  from a practical standpoint the elections only legitimised a very powerful position that was almost obviously going to go either to the ppe or s&d . so it fundamentally has done nothing for plurality and massively legitimised centralisation . 
  someone will be pissed if we get back together with russia in 2 years . 
  what is france ? 
  what was the frenchest france trough history ? 
  is it just about colour or religion or both ? 
  are alsacians french , can they be both ? 
  how about a black muslim that was born in liege ? 
  can he be french ? 
  the pope is kinda argentinian , and they are n't 100 % pure white if you know what i mean ? 
  and let 's not get started on the jews , they are pretty white and they even share a holy book with us , dirty little buggers . 
  let talk about this seriously . 
  you have 3 issues , crime rate , slums and culture shock . 
  there is no whiteness , european identity will change with or without colored people , change is inevitable . 
  do you honestly prefer white slums to slums inhabited by non europeans ? 
  do you think you 'll get special treatment because you share a ancestry ? 
  social issues are social issues unchecked imigration just higligths those issues more , but you need to resolve those social issues rather than just misrepresenting the problem as imigration , so you get the racist vote as well . 
  people that cheat and steal are not doing so because they are brown , but because they can ( or rather it 's easier than to work ) . 
  apply the law without racist exceptionalism and the next time they will go somewhere more `` tolerant '' . 
  and no this does n't mean impose a minimum sentence for weed posesion and use that as a hard on crime slogan , actual organised crime , that has victimes . 
  goverments in the eastern block where more repressive in later years than anything in post stalistins russia . 
  they took the model directly from stalin . 
  i did not say they where kind , but unlike western contries , they organised the country acording to their etnic diversity and instead of just nominating them as soviet republics they had a certain degree of autonomy , which was quite progressive . 
  no , but we have our own etnic issue . 
  was there a specific rule that governors can only be russian ? 
  actually the only requirement was that you where a party member , sometimes they promoted local minorities within the party so that a local could govern . 
  they still had local political autonomy which was less than minorities traditionally had in the west . 
  nobody `` creates '' jobs , they are a byproduct of excess capital , imagination and economic opportunities ( demand ) . 
   did anybody think otherwise ? 
   you are as a free nation free to cancel all debt ( it 's not like norway will come after you with their mighty army ) . 
   a first approximation can be done . 
  actually it ca n't be , debts are sold on capital markets , they are packaged into sorted acording to interest , yield and viability in the long term and used as currency for other transactions or colateraal for insurance , riskier deals and long term risk . 
  if they where to disapear , shit would rain on all of us . 
  because , uganda 's debt is like toilet paper in value , it 's wrapped around in special pacheging and used to `` pay parking '' but nobody actually colects . 
  us housing debt was used to `` pay for taxi '' or `` a meal at a restaurant '' and when it disapeared things got bad . 
  a former triple a country 's debt , that is what houses are bough with , you know why nobody believed or cared that the us would default , because everyone that knew finace ( not tv pundits ) knew that if a solution was not invented ( literally ) there would be no finance the next day , literally . 
  those french banks owe a lot more money to a lot of other banks , and so the web of borowing takes down the system . 
  but it 's not about direct ownership , the issue is that a small part of that theoretically secure debt is recycled in the system as `` certain '' and if that disapears over night , the whole foundation trust between huge and stable finacial companies disapears , because you ca n't be sure that somewhere among your many debts owned you do n't have that check that will bounce some day . 
  the state has no choice but to support the pension funds , it 's the political curse of our current system . 
  it is unavoidable . 
   that might sound like a good idea anyway , but not going to leave anyone better off . 
  actually the clear winners will be owners of new debt , old debt is very easy to finance and roll foward in time . 
   to prevent tensions within society early on . 
  i completely disagree , this is a very dangerous argument for policing political thinking . 
  any government can use this to bully opposition arguing they `` create tensions '' . 
  ideology is usually a release valve for dissatisfaction towards a distant and uninterested central authority . 
  if you inhibit its expression you only create extremism . 
  at this scale micromanaging is precisely this , fixing regions because they have a diferent ideological view ( ethnicity , religion , nationalism are just pretexts ), 
  i 'm curious if you understand how fragmented and derivative republican political rethoric is compared to academic economic right wing thinking .

  that 's xenophobia , dude . 
  i 'm all for regulating immigration , but treating people like cattle is n't ok . you 're also only focusing on immigration . 
  this is n't the only problem france is facing . 
  it has way bigger problems that have nothing to do with immigrants . 
  deporting immigrants is n't going to fix the economy . 
   also the people in gibraltar actually voted very clearly against brexit . 
  gibraltar is uk territory . 
  if the uk leaves , so does gibraltar . 
  if gibraltar wants to stay , it must leave the uk . 
  it 's as easy as that . 
  the `` omg !, 
  spain is annexing gibraltar ! '', 
  is a fake rhetoric that only proves that you already understand what i 've said and want special treatment . 
  you want gibraltar to stay in the uk and in the eu . 
  this is not possible . 
  lol . 
  that makes the double standard and hypocrisy even worse . 
   like a bad case of genital warts this guy has made the rounds . 
  you 're giving him too much credit . 
  farage did n't invent nationalist extremism . 
  he 's just using it for his own political agenda just like many others . 
   whatever upgrades they make to the economy will just be drained by the 3rd world openly wandering into france . 
  that 's your xenophobia talking . 
  how is the 3rd world `` draining '' your economy by taking jobs that french people do n't want ? 
  how is the 3rd world `` draining '' your economy by doing a better job for a lower price ? 
  ** that 's not the 3rd world `` draining '' the economy . 
  that 's how the open labor market works . 
  ** if companies prefer to hire immigrants for lower wages , then you have an internal problem with how your labor system works . 
  banning immigrants wo n't fix the economy . 
  the economy fixes itself when there 's healthy and regulated competition . 
  weed out the cheap companies that pay low wages and force them to obey existing job standards . 
  your problem is that you 're accusing immigrants of stealing your jobs , while you 're happily paying them low wages for doing more work . 
  these companies are the problem , not the immigrants . 
  make it so that the same job is payed the same amount regardless of who 's doing it . 
  that 's how you fix the economy . 
   i just doubt there is a politician in france ( or many in europe in general ) that have the resolve to take on the on-going demographic replacement like le pen . 
  lepen is like trump . 
  all bark but no walk . 
  they both make wild accusations that make them seem bold , but when it comes down to implementing change , they 're clueless and crawl back to putin . 
  seriously , why are lepen fans openly ignoring the fact that she has huge debts to russian banks ? 
  how can someone like that negotiate in the best interests of the eu ? 
  it 's ok when farage stokes uk nationalism to leave the eu , but it 's not ok when the irish do it to leave the uk . 
  these guys are not even trying to hide their double standards and hypocrisy . 
   `` this is in the mutual interest of both ** some ** eu citizens as well as the citizens of the united states , '' avramopoulos said . 
  fixed . 
   meps wanted the eu executive to change rules for american visitors as a reaction to the us government 's continued policy of requiring visas for anyone from poland , cyprus , croatia , romania and bulgaria . 
  citizens of other eu countries do not need visas to enter the us and us citizens can travel around all member states without visas . 
  it 's funny how bulgaria , croatia , cyprus and romania are also denied schengen entry . 
  you 'd think that these two situations are related , but it 's probably just a coincidence . 
  / s inb4 trump saying how free travel is a concept invented by and for romanians in order to make u.s. wages non-competitive . 
   france definitely needs to start deporting and/or pulling passports . 
  i have no faith in macron having the cajones to do this . 
  that 's not the only problem france is facing . 
  the economy needs a big boost and deporting immigrants wo n't achieve that . 
  you 're focusing on a single problem , while ignoring the rest which are more important . 
  ** it 's easy to close the border . 
  it 's hard to fix the economy . 
  ** lepen has literally no plan on how to fix the economy . 
  her only plan is to blame everything on immigrants and minorities . 
  macron actually has experience at handling financial issues . 
  and he 's pretty reasonable . 
  none of that is true about lepen . 
   no you 're missing the point none of the other fuckers will do anything about it so you 're left with one choice who 's still a shot choice the article is n't about the `` other fuckers '' . 
  it 's about nationalist extremism . 
   maybe , just maybe they are sick to the back teeth of people like you sticking your head in the sand and acting like there is n't a problem . 
  you 're missing the point . 
  the point is that lepen and nationalist extremism blame everything on immigrants . 
  if you want tighter borders , sure , go for it . 
  just do n't blame others for problems that are your own . 
  lepen is using the immigrant crisis to push her political agenda via fear and hate . 
  and suckers like you are falling for it . 
   policy on who we let into our country is not `` extremism '' lepen preaches fear and hate towards minorities . 
  the `` policy '' debate does n't stop at the border . 
  it goes deep within the country and it persecutes foreigners even though they are there legally . 
  and it does so for nationalist faux reasons like `` they stole our jobs '' or simply because of hate like `` go back to your own country '' . 
  this is lepen 's program to improve france . 
  she literally has no constructive policies to fix france 's issues . 
  she blames it all on immigrants . 
   what do muslims give us exactly ? 
  let 's be specific . 
  the only thing i can think of is creating jobs in airport security that rhetoric right there is what the article is talking about . 
  blatant xenophobia is being used as a political weapon . 
  this has happened before and it had catastrophic results . 
  now you blame the muslims . 
  in the past it was the jews . 
  how are you not seeing this ? 
  you 're being manipulated and used while the only thing that you 're promised in return is pain and suffering for the minorities that you hate . 
  you gain nothing from that . 
  and if you really want to be specific , think about all those poor paying jobs that you would n't do . 
  immigrants usually get them . 
  and when you fail to get that dream job , you blame it on immigrants even though you lost the job to someone who could simply do the job better . 
  it did n't even have to be an immigrant and you 'll still blame it on them . 
  and even if it were an immigrant , you 're literally blaming your incompetence on someone else who is more competent . 
  that logic makes no sense . 
  you 're being delusional . 
   `` we fought a war so you would n't speak german , so be grateful you 'll be speaking arabic '' that quote does n't exist in the article . 
  it 's not even an accurate paraphrase of what the article talks about . 
  ** the article talks about the dangers of nationalist extremism . 
  **  but pretend she 's a barbarian overlord and then you feel righteous it 's not about lepen . 
  it 's about nationalist extremism .

  i get the feeling this guy secretly wants the quotas idea to fail, 
  you bolding your texts makes it all true though, 
   this is not democracy . 
  it is indirect democracy romanians voted for meps most of our meps voted for quotas with only 2 going against will you quit with this drama ? 
   we might as well create a new eastern union starting from the core of the visegrad 4 . not until orbanistan drops the illiberal bullcrap and russia policy how do you think we will get something done with them ? 
  we will only turn in a eurasian union lite, 
   currently unemployment in transilvania is 3 % ; it would n't be such a bad thing if some of our workers moved back . 
  you cant realistically have unemployment lower than that, 
  add holocaust denier paul eisen http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/599327/jeremy-corbyn-deir-yassin-remembered-holocaust-paul-eisen, 
  i doubt he has many fans in eastern europe, 
   he will need to compromise on a lot of his ideals , he just does n't strike me as the person to do that compromise or . . 
  lie, 
   the royal family 's popularity will drop dramatically when charles becomes king . 
  what if it will be william, 
  left wing everywhere is quite fond of miners the one here in the 90s used it to beat and kill protesters ie, 
  ok i will delete that one because the bbc one is more detailed , k ? 
  i thought u meant same bbc link, 
  i dont see the duplicate, 
  should we rename the sub / r/orban ? 
  he does have some interesting friends and admirers berlusconi , chiraq , schroder , farage among some others, 
  dunno but they should considering russian influence in the war and especially what will follow next considering recent developments they have a share of the blame so they should get refugees, 
   but she said she panicked as the mass run towards her lol in panick she kicks a little girl ? 
  more interesting these days is that 2 ex ministers got some older criminal cases reopened and someone got sentenced for blackmailing the head of the highest court, 
  he may actually be a bit antisemitic http://edition.cnn.com/2009/world/europe/07/21/romania.nazi.uniform.mayor/, 
  yes, 
  the romans return !, 
  also next year gas 10 % cheaper, 
  i doubt it . 
  maybe temporarily but not for long because there 's a lot of money in there for barca and i suppose it has big influence in catalonia . 
  they could be a bit like monaco and ligue 1 ? 
   they are blocking romania & bulgaria because dear western european friends afraid that `` gypsies '' will invade their country . 
  while gipsies already are free to move, 
  gon na be stuck between rock and hard place then, 
  it also helps trade , brings more foreign investments and border guard spending will be much lower, 
  there is the eurasian union for that, 
  i kinda rather we just refuse quotas and not negotiate because we meet schengen requirements . 
  yes they belong to the richest man in the country who is currently jailed, 
  26 % efdd ? 
  not surprised 19 % enl 10 ecr is there a poll from before a couple months ago ? 
  i think there will be an obvious difference and it shows either a sudden big change in mentality or we have new very different politically posters here ( just look at the post history of some of the new posters a regular didnt see here until the last weeks ), 
   europeans did n't run during ww2 . 
  ie germans fleed even during the war lots of jews too, 
  sure mate lets give 100s of upvotes to a thread about a refugee refusing food and downvote to hell a video about a macedonian border guard beating refugees meanwhile with lots of mocking comments from / r/whiterights posters definitely nothing weird going on, 
  and it got downvoted to hell since it was against the subs new agenda that is being pushed, 
  anything else that looks ` scary ' i cant wait to see how ttip is dealt with in the end, 
   the emotional manipulation of the left the one of the right is ok tho with all the panicking and fearmongering of it 's own, 
  yes but not alone petrom , transgaz and exxon, 
  production went up 5 % last year and it will continue to raise we should be exporting more which i think is planned and apparently we have 20 billions cbm worth of gas in the black sea discovered earlier this year ( there 's oil there too dunno how much yet ), 
  i guess it means no more azeri gas to europe russian gas tho is good . 
  no big human rights problems there . 
  german approved . 
  i rather think its the spd influencing the deal, 
   i do n't lie , i just present the arguments which favor or strengthen my position . 
  lol wow, 
  havent followed you enough do you lie about other foreign people issues too ? 
  like now with the muslim crisis ? 
  yes m with capital letter, 
   they are so poor , my goodness they are poor - ganymede07011610 you are being dishonest about this .

  no more no less . 
  again bullshit total financing from eu in 2013 was of 5.5 billion euros we gave 1.4 this while we are absolutely retarded in the way we use the funds . 
  in the first 8 years of membership we spend 7 billion out of the 19 available in the cohesion funds .

  i kinda doubt fico really has a problem with this . 
  liar, 
   we have a tax on unemployment . 
  btw our new tax code added a tax for those who have no income signed just a few days ago, 
  wishful thinking ? 
  well even putin managed to fool it so why not luka too, 
  no i used a 21mbps stick and it was shit even for browsing and youtube, 
  but but that is impure, 
   or they get to kill a white european christian . 
  which may cause political problems for his government which is another win this is their main aim , not killing 1 random white guy, 
  unfortunately this is the smart decision, 
  you romanian ? 
  cute, 
  hear that , isis ? 
  why would decadent europeans be worried ? 
  slava putin, 
   i would n't consider opposing illegal immigration to be a far-right issue . 
  you havent seen the neonazi type comments then most get deleted but until that they get lots of upvotes and much of the support for the immigration threads is from them it 's more than just simple opposition to immigration, 
  hahah wtf for real ? 
  20 hours account, 
   a fraction i 'd judge some people 's ideas as a lot more than sharing a fraction, 
  thankfully we have a truther to wake us up, 
   can we please stop calling our adversaries racists why do i see new posters here against immigration also post on / r/whiterights and other racist subs ? 
   because of reddits open racist subs . 
  ive heard it 's good to let them be so the racists will stay in those areas and not spread all over other subs . 
  it 's because the immigration issue drew in a certain far-right crowd that was n't really active here before, 
  or albanian muslims, 
  czechia is central, 
  great sources  ) youtube and wikipedia stop replying im done, 
  what a conspiratard site, 
  is it their first chinese ? 
  what are the best teams in this euros ? 
  no clue, 
  well this is gon na get a tonne of downvotes, 
   the eu 's self-proclaimed president how is juncker self-proclaimed ? 
  yeah ive been seeing lots of new posters on this sub ( posters i have never seen here before suddenly being very active here ) pushing a certain agenda in the last weeks it 's interesting to go through their post history, 
  he 's a gipsy ?

  are you going to read my mind to see if i did my mental calculations correctly ? 
  and as i mentioned before , how do we even decide whose happiness is worth more ? 
  this is a complex and nuanced issue , and i 'd appreciate it if you gave it the intellectual weight it deserves instead of berating the poor sod for having made his personal decision already . 
  why would anyone make a map that includes regions that were never in the country at the same time ? 
  if i recall , the transnistria governorate region with odessa was promised by the nazis as amends for stomaching the [ second vienna award ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_vienna_award ) as well as `` temporarily '' ceding land in the [ molotov-ribbentrop pact ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) . 
  the plan was that the lands north of the prut would be retaken and extended , as shown on the map , through [ barbarossa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_barbarossa ) . 
  it should either look like the historical [ greater romania ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/romania_1930_ethnic_map_en.png ) , which is by far the most prevalent and idealised nationalist map , or the [ real 1941 map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/recensamant_1941_judete.png ) . 
  also , in my opinion , even assuming a total axis victory in ww2 , these borders would not have stood for long . 
  romania would 've likely tried to have its cake and eat it too by challenging the [ newly enlarged hungary ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/hungary_1941_ethnic.svg/860px-hungary_1941_ethnic.svg.png ) for full control of transylvania . 
  funnily enough , it is only in this far-fetched hypothetical situation that [ this silly map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tfxt9jz.jpg ) makes sense . 
  consider your reply to / u/atred , which i totally agree with , that aromanian * ie * is simply ` it is ' ( * e * ) , while also claimed to have some kind of affirmative function in his dictionary . 
  now let us consider that many languages use [ echo responses ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/echo_answer ) alongside ` yes ' , some of them even exclusively so , including grandpa latin , as you also mentioned above . 
  these are so common in romanian that you would n't bat an eye if someone answered * ai fost la cinema ? 
  * ( did you go to the cinema ? ), 
  with * am fost . 
  * ( i did . ), 
  instead of * da . 
  * ( yes . ) . 
  my first hypothesis is either that aromanians generally prefer echo responses , or that they only have echo responses . 
  with that said , i think the dictionary / u/atred linked took the lazy way out when faced with this gap in a rare , endangered language and just put * ie * because it might be the most common verb to echo perhaps . 
  now assuming all these are close enough to being true , my second hypothesis is that ` yes ' was not as basic and common a term as you think it is . 
  both aromanian and romanian share the echo responses inherited from latin , but romanian had much more contact , forced or otherwise , with old slavic . 
  not that aromanians did n't have contact with nearby bulgarians , but romanian was surrounded by slavic speakers . 
  * da * could 've easily passed into common usage in romanian lands alongside the traditional echos because they are n't really competing concepts , in fact they can reinforce each other like most modern romance languages can attest . 
  of course this is all a house of cards argument and i could be totally wrong , but it was fun thinking about it . 
  yeah fuck tolerance !, 
  it was just a prank , bro !, 
  here 's a plausible timeline : 1 . 
  latin starts off only with the verb-repeating way of saying yes directly . 
  it also has a bunch of euphemistic ways of doing it , like * ita * , * etiam * , * sic * , and some other ones i ca n't recall . 
  vulgar latin varieties still mainly used verb-repeating , but these other words continue to exist , probably with some esoteric local connotations . 
  after all , how weird is it that * sic * ( * like that * ) came to mean * yes * in the west , but * and * in romanian ? 
  proto-romanian splits from its western siblings , and then at some point into aromanian and daco-romanian , which is where they stop sharing innovations . 
  note that verb-repeating has been kept to this day in all varieties . 
  ( daco - ) romanian innovates a direct way of saying yes , in this case * ita * -  * ta * \\* -  * da * , just like western varieties innovated their yes from * sic * or * hoc * . 
  i do n't know why they innovated this way . 
  maybe peer pressure from neighboring germanics/slavs ? 
  since there 's nothing wrong with relying on verb-repetition for your affirmatives , aromanian could 've simply skipped this step . 
  i think a whole lot of languages are this way ; it may even be that the yes/no languages are the peculiar ones here . 
  without such ubiquitous uses as * yes * or * and * or * if * , the original words were relegated to being fancy pants demonstratives like * indeed * , * thus * , * furthermore * in aromanian and over time were discarded or replaced by invading vocabulary . 
  personally , i do n't buy it , since the slavic root seems much more likely . 
  in fact , the previous argument can be turned around to support this view : since proto-ro started off only with verb-repeating , it would n't be that much of a bother for the locals to learn a new word ( * da * ) since it 's not competing with any other emphatic yeses/yesses , and then they could communicate with slavs more easily . 
  are you familiar with the phenomenon in history known as [ presentism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/presentism_\\ ( literary_and_historical_analysis \\ ) ) ? 
  i read askhistorians often and it seems to be a generally well regarded rule of thumb when it comes to historical analysis . 
  here 's the first paragraph in the wikipedia article on it :  in literary and historical analysis , presentism is the anachronistic introduction of present-day ideas and perspectives into depictions or interpretations of the past . 
  some modern historians seek to avoid presentism in their work because they consider it a form of cultural bias , and believe it creates a distorted understanding of their subject matter . 
  the practice of presentism is regarded by some as a common fallacy in historical writing . 
  if you have some time , could you please explain the differences , if any , between the viewpoint you were outlining in your post above , and the concept of presentism as laid out in said wiki article ? 
  it is n't , the english cognate is to adhere and adherence . 
  in esports , koreans who move to the west are also known for having a weird inability to cope with a lack of korean food . 
  it 's possible that despite the availability of foreign foods , many choose to ignore them . 
  it 's a trade off between efficient decision-making ( dictatorship ) and representation with consent ( democracy ) . 
  when the romans were in a time of crisis , they valued a dictator over the senate because quick , decisive action was agreed to be more important than careful deliberation that sought the most optimal outcomes for the senators ( the voting class ) . 
  in times of peace , it was the opposite . 
  a benevolent dictator is the hypothetical combination of these , which is an individual that makes quick decisions that also correspond to what the voting class would 've decided if given unlimited time to deliberate and think . 
  the main downside is that once this one-in-a-million individual dies , it 's almost certain that his successor will fail to live up to expectations and degenerate into a regular dictator , so benevolent dictatorship is not a long term solution to the problem of good governance . 
  however , in the short term it 's better by definition . 
  how are they lower than animals ? 
  even if i 'm being charitable with that interpretation , i 'd put them at the same level at worst . 
  my favourite subtitle translation of `` fuck ! '', 
  was from the film ultraviolet ( 9 % rotten tomato rating ) , where it was `` futu-i ! '' . 
  surprisingly accurate !, 
  think of it like collective bargaining in the context of labour unions . 
  it is , but the status quo is too entrenched to be swayed without strong enough one-way arguments . 
  anybody else notice the derpface-like microtits on the mural in the last pic ? 
  a few random counterexamples : ** saxony **  the names saksamaa and saksa are derived from the name of the germanic tribe of the saxons . 
  [ ... ] in finnish and estonian the words that historically applied to ancient saxons changed their meaning over the centuries to denote the whole country of germany and the germans . 
  ** ionia **  the second major form , used in many languages and in which the common root is `` yun '' or `` ywn '' , is borrowed from the greek name ionia , the ionian tribe region of asia minor . 
  in greek , these forms have never normally been used to denote the whole greek nation or greece . 
  ( examples : al-y\u016bn\u0101n , yunastan , yavana ) ** cathay **  this group of names derives from khitan , an ethnic group that originated in manchuria and conquered parts of northern china . 
  due to long domination of northern china by these nomadic conquerors , it was considered by northwestern people as the land of the khitan . 
  ( examples : \u041a\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0439 in russian and similar in other east slavics + bulgarian ) i do n't consider it a problem that the netherlands are called holland sometimes . 
  just out of curiosity , are you one of those people that takes offence when us citizens call themselves americans ? 
  you said it , bro !, 
  i can praise a good swimmer for swimming well . 
  i can also praise a bad swimmer for having the foresight to find a better route for himself around the water . 
  the first thing i thought of was the liberum veto , and that turned out great . 
  sorry to interrupt , i just wanted to ask : do n't you think `` who 's in the party '' is an issue some might find important ? 
  that 's a motto i would put my life behind , to be honest . 
  i interpreted it as saying that you can think people are wrong or have a wrong worldview without thinking they 're stupid . 
  you probably think the person you 're replying to is wrong , but would you say he 's mentally buggered because of it ? 
  yeah but who qualifies as a human depends on culture . 
  ideas that lead to acknowledging untermenschen or principles like the three-fifths compromise can be a bit picky when it comes to handing out personhood status . 
  you would think so , but this exact argument was had when croatia seceded from yugoslavia back in the day . 
  milosevic said , `` how would you like it if serb regions seceded from * you * ? 
  '' , and croatia replied that those regions lacked appropriate representation . 
  eventually it came down to war . 
  agreed , with everything except the last sentence . 
  the precise reason may be irrelevant morally , but it gives us a sociological data point . 
  what about john rawls , who described the opposite ? 
  it 's not a settled issue , you know . 
  what 's with all the sarcasm in 1 ) ? 
  is that not a reasonable view , that the average white american is n't as smart or hardworking as their asian immigrant counterparts ? 
  not in the sense he means . 
  in romanian and french , for example , its cognate just means protest or demonstration . 
  in english , it 's more literal and general because it means to make visible or evident . 
  you could say that the aurora borealis is a manifestation of solar wind in earth 's magnetic field . 
  the metaphor is still possible in english , though . 
  protests are a manifestation of people 's discontent . 
  the big difference is that this meaning has crystallised in the other languages , to the point where the specific metaphor has superseded the general meaning .

  it 's just that what you said is n't true . 
  true . 
  but your statement is wrong then no ? 
  it is a monarch alive in romanian royal family . 
  sebi ghi\u021b\u0103 is worse in absolute terms than livu\u021b though . 
  calling everyone there and romanians as a whole ** gypsy ** does that to you in / r/romania , 
  did king michael died ? 
  so in fact we got ** f.i.t.a ** by ourselves . 
  at least by those who were to * busy * to vote . 
  usr voter here , 
  i did what any normal in the head human beign should do in this country !, 
  even if it 's not exactly able to do it irl !, 
  ** partikip **, 
  i think it 's a hospital there so patients from other places in that county can vote there . 
  it 's a small village . 
  there 's sieni close to my village . . but it 's not much of a city lol, 
  dead people do n't sleep much . . : /, 
  northern wallachia is waaaaay ahead to more than half of transylvania . 
  we do n't have to kid ourselves and think we 're the best cuz we are n't . 
  and covered ... lol, 
  i 'll do that !!!, 
  huh ?!, 
  0 . o ooooookay ... i do n't exactly remember ... . 
  no , you should go to a psychiatrist !, 
  you have enough reasons to live !, 
  everything i see give me reasons to enjoy life , even the cold outside . . which i hate hahaha, 
  for some people `` helping the poor '' = `` encouragement of laziness '' !, 
  maybe some people should feel a little how it is not to live in a welfare state or in mommy 's basement and talk about real life then . . no money , no heat , no food , no clothes , no shoes ... first is the most important anyway . 
  what i get for granted today it could end up in a blink if my parents and brothers will die tomorrow . . same with some people , if their state will became different they 'll definitely gon na have a surprise too !, 
  i 'm not to much into assisted suicide . 
  i guess if it 's for a person with a terminal illness i could be okay-ish with it but not so much for anybody else . 
  i mean for depressed people or such . 
  you are a sadist !!!, 
  me and ghi\u021b\u0103 lolol, 
  i 'm out to vomit the horse meat ughhhh, 
  he 's a good father no ? 
  of course you do !, 
  ofc it is, 
  what is utter nonsense ? 
  to be beaten only because you 're not a local is utter nonsense in my opinion . 
  i do n't . . haha, 
  we start to have that soros c. . p here too . 
  it must be a trend in * nationalist * circles . 
  i think is more stupidity and like you said manipulation . 
  too bad since we used to look up to your country as a leader for central-eastern european eu members . 
  ohhhh i hate you, 
  i know how it is . . but bulgarian and turkish people . . in poland ?!, 
  something does n't compute here . 
  of course there is but i never heard in the last years about somebody beating a guy only because he 's gypsy . 
  i may be wrong though, 
  were n't greeks living on the black sea shores too ? 
  anyways it was a joke , 
  how nationalism can even be taken in consideration when bulgaria and turkey are n't even close to their borders ?!, 
  what kind of nationalist hate somebody from the other part of the continent ?!, 
  they usually have a grudge against their neighbours who `` stole their land '' or something like that . 
  poland is not france or uk , they did n't had colonies so their nationalism ca n't be against people from africa , asia or . . other parts of europe . 
  that would be the case if bulgaria and turkey would be some sort of aggressive neighbours . 
  since they are n't even neighbouring poland i think nationalism is out of the question imo . 
  i never heard about such things happening here though !, 
  nobody will beat you only cuz you 're not romanian here or because you 're darker/whiter . . / greener etc downvotes wo n't change facts . 
  race ... yup , does n't exist my friend !, 
  greek race ofc !, 
  not when other nationals are involved . 
  racist attacks on polish people in uk is n't local news . 
  what the hell is wrong with some people ? 
  if i continue talking to you i 'll become a vegan !, 
  i do n't like hotdogs . 
  put a korean flair there ya * horrible * * person * !!!!, 
  the dogs ?!, 
  i guess you could . . barbarian :p, 
  he could 've eat both my dogs in fact . 
  i have two very small dogs . 
  so is sis . . no ? 
  since you call me bro . .  bigot !, 
  so you 're okay with what this is ? 
  say what sis ?!, 
  why should it be a risky one my flower ? 
  huh ? 
  i have one . . but i 'm not one :p, 
  for the ones who like it only !, 
  i do n't know what they do in u.s. , we are europeans  it wo n't work imo . 
  and if it will it only make the * subject * unhappy for the rest of her/his life . 
  i 'm not sure what is that . 
  like if she/he want to become straight ? 
  that person will probably feel guilty because of outside influences , just like i felt guilty after i had sex first time because `` sex is forbidden for good girls '' . 
  thankfully i have a very open minded mother !, 
  god !, 
  thank you !!!, 
  i think i said more or less the same thing !, 
  as long as you let kids and animals out of your sex life . . enjoy !, 
  unfortunately if you would n't erase it i 'm sure i 'll read it sooner or later . . my curiosity is stronger than me : /, 
  your sexuality only make you unhappy when outside influences are strong . 
  otherwise sex should make you happy these days . . as long as you use the pill and a condom . 
  if it 's a crookery then it should be banned . 
  i 'm all for it . 
  especially if it makes you worse and charge money for it !, 
  i 'd say jail time is very suitable !, 
  i do n't talk about `` gay cure therapy '' here , which is a damn sham !, 
   anyways , they eat cats there ? 
  i thought it 's dogs not cats !,

   british hostility towards the eu has been planted in all anglophone country , with the added problem that these people do n't know the first thing about european politics and honestly believe the eu is about to collapse . 
  we should prove them wrong just out of spite . 
   stop creating self-harming sanctions !, 
  some things are bigger than self interest . 
  i 'll take a guess and say the hit your cheese market took was minimal . 
  thank god !, 
  that 's why i said that putin is hurting his own people , because sanctions did have an effect on their economy . 
  unfortunately , last time someone said almost everyone else in europe is doing better than russia when it comes to income , he was almost punched in the face . 
  you 're right . 
  they 're in a really bad state . 
   all in all the majority thinks that romania will be doing very well in the future . 
  it 's nice to hear german people have a positive outlook about us . 
  thanks !, 
   i have yet to visit and i am planning to do so , in the not to distant future . 
  hope you 'll have fun when you do !, 
  how is romania viewed in germany ? 
  both from a historical point of view and now . 
  dutch people ... how possible is for the netherlands to exit the european union in the following years ? 
  the netherlands is considered by some the most eurosceptic country after the uk . 
  how true is that ? 
   nuclear-capable submarine to always stay somewhere in the baltic sea would surely prevent russia from messing with the baltics ever again . 
  i doubt that . 
   and iirc romania ? 
  no source on ro we have n't yet . 
  we will this year . 
  sure and we are in the process of getting our shit together . 
  at least romania , poland and the baltic states . 
  i do n't know much about how the others are doing . 
  that 's absolutely fucking disgusting of her . 
  wow . 
   but also took remedial european history in grade school . 
  not to mention current events in georgia and ukraine teach you all you need to know . 
  which proves you 're not ignorant of this matter . 
  calling eastern europeans paranoid and ignoring our entire history with russia while being in a country far , far away from russia is so obnoxious . 
  care to explain the last one ? 
  what do the many shades represent ? 
  no rest for the wicked . 
  that looks so awesome !, 
   remember to be mindful of the cars though . 
  so ... how many reposts should we have ? 
  northern = / = nordic . 
  ah , glorious latin . 
  no problem with that . 
  i would just prefer if they did n't do it at the expense of other countries and based on laughable argumentation like this :  we have neither cultural nor political similarities with russia , ukraine or belarus which are bulwark of e. europe . 
  better prove you 're more like the nordics than talk shit with not much to show . 
  that 's what we learn in school , that 's on wikipedia and it should be a well known fact , but i 'm not from the baltics and do n't feel like i need to constantly remind people that !, 
  ! i 'm not eastern european !!, 
  just to feel better about myself . 
  i do , however , take offense when baltics say that they have less in common with russia than romania and czechia . 
  i mean ... * lol * . 
  well , then , romania is southeastern . 
  that 's our geographical position . 
  this is so tiring . 
  especially when you hear them saying `` oh , of course , it 's because we have nothing in common , politically , culturally or otherwise , with the europoors in eastern europe who are so obviously like russia . '', 
  do you even know the first thing about the countries you 're shitting on ? 
  what the hell do russia and romania or russia and czechia have in common politically and culturally ? 
  this is what we call an inferiority complex . 
  `` oh , i 'm not called ee anymore , i 'm suddenly so awesome ! '', 
  so does romania has any cultural or political similarities to russia ? 
  does czechia ? 
  well , obviously !, 
  few more places to go . 
  lol, 
   except it was n't putin who started all that mess in ukraine [ oh dear !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/8ux3oiweliq?t=12 ), 
  imagine living in a country where protesting could get you to die in jail . 
  imagine that . 
  that sentence alone should give you reason to protest for your own interests , if the good of humanity is n't enough for you . 
   crimea and ukraine thing are just temporary things ( almost forgotten now ) i guess it 's easy to forget a war when it 's not your country that suffers . 
   one thing i find concerning is that many people voted for brexit with the expectation that the uk would have access to the single market . 
  maybe they did n't know enough about it and what it entails ? 
  but when they do find out , they will probably be okay with uk not being in the single market . 
  jokes on you , germany 's not better . 
  it was obvious . 
  they did n't want freedom of movement and that comes with the single market . 
  i 'm glad she could finally say it so people will stop fighting over whether or not they 'll stay in it . 
  if you fail a project , you have to return the money to the eu afaik . 
  hahaha !, 
  good one !, 
   finland will never ever get eu funding more than we are paying to them already that 's because you 're already rich and you do n't need it . 
  and someone explained :  yes , eu economies are so interconnected that rising demand in the 2004/2007 accession member states will also be felt in the developed economies of the eu . 
  if you look at recent statistics the 2004/2007 countries have had very high growth rates , in part thanks to cohesion funds , but that higher demand has also partly helped the traditional eu economies grow . 
   other countries aside , romania 's trade alone has more than double since it joined in 2007 , reaching $ 150 billion a year in 2016 and most of it is with other eu members like germany , italy and france , which are net contributors . 
  it does n't take a genius to understand that a trade increase of that magnitude has been creating hundreds of thousands of jobs , not in just romania , but in the net contributor states . 
   this is why cohesion funds exist , and this is why it 's monumentally short-sighted when people complain about them . 
  also , keep calling my country a shit hole if it makes you feel better . 
  -11 now in bucharest , but tomorrow is predicted to be -18 . 
  but that 's how eu 's funds work . 
  you have a project , you present it , if it 's good enough , you get funding . 
  why ? 
  so that was referencing the `` nazi propaganda '' comment i always saw following a `` polish death camps '' comment . . 
  thanks for the info !, 
  i do n't think i 've ever used `` polish death camps '' and i wo n't start using it . 
  best to use nazi death camps . 
   yup , because repeating stereotypes/distortions/lies over and over again solidifies them . 
  that 's why the polish are so sensitive to improper death camps naming , btw. , and rightfully so . 
  but hey , that 's fun , is n't it ? 
  i 've always seen this as interesting because if i 'd ever say `` polish death camps '' i 'd never say it , or expected someone to interpret it , as death camps made by the polish people . 
  if i 'd ever use it , i 'd use it as an indicator of where they were geographically placed . 
  and honestly , if someone leaves that kind of conversation with the idea that `` aha , so it was the polish who created these camps , not the germans ! '',

  in case you forgot you 're leaving a union . 
  [ the majority of scots voted to stay . 
  and i just found this really nice video today . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dra7jyiojm ), 
  the eu is neither failing nor falling apart . 
  i love how bitter the uk is . 
  it would veto even things they benefit from if it means that would annoy the eu . 
  the long bitter con . 
  honestly , i 'm over brexit . 
  i 'm not sad , i 'm not happy , it 's just a fact now . 
  for all i care , uk could trigger article 50 tomorrow . 
  i just feel bad for the scots . 
  have n't they already done that ? 
  we remember it and i know some ukrainians feel disappointed with how slowly things progress between the eu and ukraine , but there 's not much we , on reddit , can do so your bitterness is misplaced . 
  hell no . 
  well , at least it looks as gay as true football which makes it european . 
  which no one else plays . 
  and it looks more like handball to me . 
  there 's only on type of football and that is ... well , football . 
  goddamn it , france !, 
  oh , god , no ! \u2122, 
  thanks !, 
  is there any website that contains information on how many refugees a country promised to take in and how many it has taken so far ? 
  by the way , i kind of agree . 
  greece and italy are being flooded with refugees and those countries ca n't hold them all . 
  sort out the economic migrants from refugees and relocate some of them to ease the pressure on greece and italy . 
  never heard of that song , but i know one of the artists . 
  not planning on listening to it either . 
  putin being smooched by an old lady  ) ), 
  looks a bit trippy . 
  well ... uhm , most of them . 
  this is what angered me the most reading through these replies from western people . 
  `` oh , but that 's your taste . '', 
  or `` how could you like the taste of the same product in my country ? 
  you do n't even know what it taste likes . '', 
  jesus , it 's like we 're not people , it 's like `` oh those others who obviously prefer a lower quality product than i have . 
  not just that , but they want to pay the same money or more money for that low quality product . '', 
   not all are scum , but there is a lot of moroccan scum in holland who makes the streets unsafe this sounds awfully familiar to what another politician said . 
  our budget for 2017 which has been approve 2 days ago includes 2 % for defense . 
   five countries meet the nato target - the us , poland , estonia , greece and the uk and romania . 
  14 days this year . 
  * glares at bulgaria *, 
  bolec and lolec . 
  yes , we 've had them . 
   well he is n't really dude ... you inaugurated a statue for fallen soviet soldiers . 
  soviet soldiers for christ 's sake ... 
  oh , you again . 
  well , all i can say is that last time putin was in your country , he threatened my country and poland with nuclear weapons and your officials said absolutely nothing . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  you 'd rather lean on russia cause what ? 
  they would definitely not act in their own interest ? 
  russia is the definition of `` self interest above everything '' . 
  did you sarcastically put an / s there ? 
  yeah , that i can understand . 
  yeah , it must have been horrible , i understand that , but you have to consider what communism would have done to your country politically and economically . 
  i wo n't even mention the 15 years of soviet occupation , mass deportations , the annexation of basarbia , torture of the `` enemies of the regime '' and the like . 
  oh ... you better not oppress them , latvia . 
  then again , you were saved by the west from communism and thus you are a bit more advanced than us today . 
   churchill suggested that the soviet union should have 90 percent influence in romania and 75 percent in bulgaria ; the united kingdom should have 90 percent in greece ; and they should have 50 percent each in hungary and yugoslavia . 
   stalin did keep to his promise about greece , but did not keep his promise for romania , bulgaria , and hungary , which became one-party communist states with no british influence . 
  no idea . 
  maybe / u/karmagovernment can tell us ? 
  funny story : we had protests recently and one of the politicians we hate the most was mocked with signs saying `` erdogan de teleorman '' as in he 's acting like erdogan and he 's originally from the romanian county teleorman so sort of `` the erdogan from teleorman '' . 
  how big is that minority ? 
  ah yes , the glorious roman empire . 
  i do n't know , i knew bulgaria was more russia friendly than romania , but not to the point where the majority would choose russia when asked a question like this . 
  they 're in nato after all . 
  serbia is understandable and greece is just outright weird . 
  so is slovenia . 
  we 're orthodox too , but no way we 'd lean towards russia . 
  and we 're in the middle of it . 
  suddenly , we 're poland . 
  how do you rely on russia and us at the same time ? 
  they 're at odds with each other . 
  or at least they were before trump . 
  seriously ? 
  also ... 
  bulgaria ?? 
  what are you doing ?? 
  greece ?? 
  this is indeed a problem that has been mentioned before . 
  i think that these kind of actions should not be acceptable and the eu should definitely look into this . 
  so ... are we getting our treasury back ? 
  30 years ? 
  more like 4 years if the indifferent people do n't learn anything . 
  honestly , i loved the protests , and their support has fallen because of the events , but i am still unsure they wo n't be back a few years later . 
  while their number of voters is n't big , people just generally do n't vote . 
  only 40 % of the population voted in december , when we had parliamentary elections . 
  dacian ciolos you da real mvp < 3, 
  yes . 
  i think they like keeping us constantly in the streets . 
  i 'm so sick of this government , i would prefer `` brussels ' bureaucrats '' over them any day of the week . 
  i 'd simplify it as much as i can without losing any important details and spread it to the media and social media . 
  yeah , but it was n't exactly up to us . 
  if i was picking , we 'd be a founding member . 
  ( \u2310 \u25a0 _ \u25a0 ) this of course , after we grabbed corruption by the ... 
  it was romania playing though about canada lifting visas for us . 
  they said they will and we said alright . 
  it was the right thing to ask for it , but i think we should also have some public debate about the deal itself . 
  i 'd like to see the reason too .

  they wo n't have the same authority under russian influence . 
  the russians , unlike the eu , wo n't let them run their mouths or do whatever they want if it does n't benefit the russians primarily . 
  do you think russia will be soft on them or on us ? 
  they 'll fuck everyone who steps out of the line in no time . 
  russia has no love for us and the majority of us do n't have any love for it either . 
  it would be ** catastrophic ** if we were to pull out of eu and become partners with russia . 
  and the thing is . . psd needs this divide ( not just economical , but educational ) for votes . 
  if the divide does n't exist , psd is n't as popular . 
  in the end , ciolos is not a god , he ca n't fix everything , but he tried to fix some things in this one year . 
  that 's a good point , but are they willing to lose almost complete popularity if they drift towards russia and we face economical suicide ? 
  same here . 
  this is completely and utterly fucked up . 
  most young people voted for usr ( save romania union , a new party ) or pnl ( national liberal party ) . 
  the social democrats won enough votes that they 'll probably be able to make a majority alone , without the help of coalitions , but their friend party ( alde ) might be in the new parliament too . 
  all i can say is that psd is corrupted and with this election we will lose the best pm and government romania ever had . 
  it 's truly sad and i do n't know how much hope i have left . 
  yeah , i hoped so too . 
  but i think a lot of the people who were at the protests voted . 
  it just was n't enough . 
  this will be a dark period for us . 
  hopefully they do n't create really big controversies . . 
  we are officially fucked . 
   that 's what happens when barely 40 % of the people vote and young people have the lowest turnout . 
  and it 's even worse for those of us who appreciated our current government . 
  we `` tasted '' better things and now we 'll go back to shit . 
  parliamentary elections . 
  go drunk you 're home, 
  sir , how dare you . 
  wallachia is n't the poorest region . 
  make wallachia great again, 
  of course . 
  psd trained them to ... i 'm joking , but they usually vote for the social democrats so yeah . 
  you can also pick `` prezenta tari diaspora '' and see the diaspora vote . 
  almost 1000 in germany . 
  just heard that there 's 20 injured on the news . 
  that 's awful , i 'm sorry, 
  we have a long way to go ... 
   romania will never ban smoking in private residences well ... good . 
  i would never support that . 
  i think we should be orange on that map . 
  smoking is banned indoors ( actually the law describes it as `` a 3 wall construction '' so a bus station also counts ) and it 's banned near playgrounds . 
  we went through the same thing recently . 
  i 'm a smoker so for me it sucked , but i do n't dwell on these laws anymore either . 
  it is what it is . 
  what i dislike is that the bars i 've been to during winter do n't offer any sort of area where we could smoke and not die freezing . 
  summer is pretty much okay because we 're all outside , but winters can get pretty fucking cold and it sucks . 
  there are places where they offer you blankets or have some sort of warmth radiator outside , but they 're not the majority . 
   germanic or slavic race . 
  latin race best race my friend . 
  we 're gon na call dem italians and bring back the roman empire in a second just you wait, 
  please do n't take him seriously . 
  he 's either a troll or a dickhead . 
  there will be a referendum on the definition of the term `` family '' in constitution ( to either remain as it is - formed by the consensual marriage of the spouses - or as the religion nutjobs want it - formed by the consensual marriage between a man and a woman - ) , we 're not banning gays . 
  it 's just that some religious nutjobs gathered signatures for this referendum . 
  and there have been some protests against it . 
  honestly , i know we ca n't offer them as much as germany , but this seems reckless . 
  sometimes , they have children below the age of 1 with them and they put them in dangerous situations when they try to cross the border hidden god knows where . 
  romania is n't the best option out there , but it is far from the worst . 
  actually , i was wondering about hungary . 
  it 's surprising to see it above switzerland for example . 
  but like you said , an absence of laws does not mean the situation is worse . 
  this is about legal rights and not public opinion . 
   nobody really cares if you 're gay or not . 
  you can not make that claim . 
   they can adopt children . 
  legal ( which is pretty much legal in most european countries ) :  adoption by single homosexuals in russia or ( in case of russian children ) in foreign countries that do not recognise same-sex marriage illegal :  step-child adoption by same-sex couples  joint adoption by same-sex couples, 
  more than italy ? 
  small victories . 
  / s also , why are liechtenstein , san marino and monaco so low ? 
  and georgia so high ? 
  :o on a serious note , i hope that my country 's attitude towards the lgbt community will improve with time . 
  the biggest problem is education among older folks . 
  take these elections for example : - older people are more likely to turn up to the vote , young people not so much . 
  the youth seems sick and tired with the political class so they think it 's useless to vote . 
  untrue , in my opinion , but that 's the general feeling . 
  this is also an important factor as to why young people leave for the west , which in turns creates a brain drain for romania . 
  however , with the rise of usr , a lot of people who did n't usually vote have decided to give them a chance . 
  - civic education ( or education generally ) is a key factor in how people elect their representatives . 
  romania needs to improve this asap . 
  it is n't just a lack of awareness towards corruption , it 's that some of the condone it with selfishness and stupidity . 
  `` what does it matter that the economy will suffer if they cut taxes ? 
  i care about * me * and * right now * rather than about * the collective well being * and * the future * . '', 
  - old people in rural places represent the easiest target for political propaganda . 
  they 're uninformed and some of the uneducated . 
  it 's easy to influence them . 
  - that 's not to say that there are n't young people who vote for corrupt politicians , mainly because they were influenced by their surroundings , but they 're a much smaller percentage . 
  - nationalists are usually against liberals , who are the less corrupted side of the romanian political spectrum . 
  but i do think that we 're taking baby steps in the right direction . 
  hopefully this election will end in a triumph against corrupted parties like psd . 
  yes , i agree . 
  i think it 's very important for citizens to be part of the process . 
  we do n't just need politicians to stop being corrupt , we need to teach people that they should n't practice it or encourage it either . 
  well i think that the general plan is to : - make sure dna is not politically bullied - support and enforce transparency measures - battling political influence in public institutions by making sure that top positions are occupied based on merit and not influence - encouraging citizens to battle corruption themselves . 
  not only by not taking part in it , but by noticing the authorities any time they witness corruption . 
  ( bribing medical stuff , abuse of power , etc. ), 
  several apps or hotlines have come out too , in hope it 'll make it easier and more attractive to citizens . 
  a level of anonymity is ensures as well . 
  this whole article is cancer . 
  they do n't invade they * liberate * u n00b, 
  economic protectionism their wiki says .

  edit : part of my family greatly benefited from this freedom of movement . 
  given such a huge opportunity they relocated everywhere in the soviet union , but they chose undisclosed locations in siberia the most , of all places . 
  those fuckers , did n't even call back !, 
  in compensation , some russian dudes mixed freely in their previous homes , so i guess you 're on to something there . 
  let me spell it for you then : i 'm going to put these russians inside their little republic , so i can protect their interests with my army .

  that was the effect of the '30 crisis , when agricultural exports were screwed , and we were doing something like 80 % agri . 
  you 'll notice gdp/capita did not recover to 1913 levels . 
  if you 're going to cherry-pick ... ninja edit : http://europeaneconomics.wordpress.com/2012/04/04/romania-during-the-great-depression-a-few-familiar-echoes/ i am not idealizing pre-ww2 romania , but it really is more complicated than `` we were always backward '' . 
   romania was pretty backward berfore communism , too ( compared to western countries ) . 
  that 's [ nonsense ] ( http://www.cepr.org/meets/wkcn/1/1699/papers/broadberry_klein.pdf ) . 
  it was n't as rich , yes , but definitely not backward , and developing nicely . 
  we had a fairly modern state , industry had recovered after the '30s crisis which hit it hard ( only to get into a war , meh ) agricultural output was great , etc. 
  with a proper economy , the social issues that were prevalent would have been fixable . 
  there 's no way of knowing `` what if '' the communist disaster did n't happen , but fwiw my prediction is significantly different from yours . 
  nope , dobrogea . 
  in a rather small and remote village , everybody got these for free from the council : http://i.imgur.com/ev5pvfc.jpg that was 2 years ago . 
  one year ago they actually started collecting the trash :-) i think it would actually be a lot easier there to sort and recycle than in the city , exactly because of the lack of existing infrastructure . 
  most organic waste is being used ( animal food , compost , or what not ) , trash is mostly plastic/paper/metal . 
  compare with the single dumpster arrangement in an apartment bloc . 
  the tractor and trailer that picks up the trash every thursday really does throw everything in a big pile .

  these are not necessarily everyday food , but certainly stuff you 'd expect every now and then , and they 're well known . 
  if you visit romania and are in a good restaurant , try them out . 
  american-style beef steak is pretty good . 
  we make it more bland here . 
  it 's not the `` what keys do i press '' kind of usability . 
  the whole `` you just need to exchange keys '' is a hassle even with a keyserver , when you 're not dealing with the same set of people regularly . 
  there is no easy solution for groups ( e.g.

  it 's up to you if these hassles are worth it for the [ extra security ] ( http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security.png ),

  yeah , swiping a passport in a reader is so much harder over the border . 
  the only valid point you could make would have been that since we have external eu border we 'd allow outside criminals in , and it 's not like that is n't happening now either .

   are they learning how to code ? 
  think turtle graphics & the like . 
  you 're not actually writing code , but you 're learning how functions compose to get some result . 
  i still vividly remember this as my first a-ha !, 
  moment in programming : when i figured that drawing increasing radius circles in a loop will get me a solid circle . 
  i was 8-9 ( 3rd grade ) , learning some basic , without a computer at home . 
  imho , starting as early as 5 with some simple things nowadays is really good . 
  do n't call it coding if you do n't want to , but it can certainly be closer to that than writing html :p,

  i would like for each country to have the full price split in the 3 main components : production cost , distribution cost and taxes . 
  this would be way more interesting . 
  also do n't get me started in beauty and hygiene products . 
  same product , same price , sky rocket difference ... 
  yes but we ee people have embedded the idea that western products are superior , which is true but only if you buy them from there . 
  unfortunately companies took advantage of the customer mindset mostly for profit , since in many cases is the same price they charge for the product . 
  also for many google is hometab . 
  so it has this advantage , u start your browsing session with pinging google , 
  and put in jail the parents ? 
  those children did n't marry by themselves ... 
  as volume or surface ? 
  i dont know how to explain better . 
  it 's the principle of communicating vessels . 
  the principle states that the level of liquid tends to be the same on both vessels . 
  so if u have extra water , lets say from melting antartica the rise of the planetary ocean should be similar . 
  but if you make a dam on the mediterranean ( one of the vessels ) , the extra volume of water wo n't spread equally . 
  so instead of a general 1m rise in all vessels , u would get 0m in the mediterranean and 1.25 m everywhere else , if you try to drain further more the mediterranean by another 1m to create even more earth mass , given the planetary system of water distribution stays the same , it will increase the all oceans by another 0.25 m. 
  so while you create more land for south europe and north africa you flood everybody else . 
  given the stakes i could see that if the impact is visible china would declare war in order to save shanghai . 
  just for the lulz france would have to declare war on itself  ) since it borders both vessels . 
  the numbers are just for the sake of the example and have nothing to do with real volumes of planetary ocean data . 
  the problem might be that the water might circumvent the dam and flood portugal and coastal africa . 
  also 2m saved in the mediterranean could mean maybe 0.5 m high on the east coast ... that would stir up the pot ... 
  i am not against russians expanding the infrastructure network on their money , it 's ok , the more pipes come to europe the better . 
  the problem is not to let russians buy our infrastructure . 
  also we should build regional networks so that all europe is integrated from greece to norway , and from spain / italy to romania . 
  well it is depressing cause i hoped we would be average at least ... not top row ... on principle racial profiling is structurally biased , meaning the more you break down against a certain group the more statistics will support it even more , while other groups are ignored ... 
  damn more depressing news ... :(, 
  well i presumed you have ... pardon me kind sir if i was wrong !, 
  it 's in the soil lol !, 
  no ... god !, 
  it was funny comment just as saying do n't jinx it  ) why you all taking so serious this conversation :p, 
  or u can buy it to dismantle it . 
  it 's the best strategy for market control . 
  buy companies , take all their know how , then the moment that the market is saturated or on a downward trend , dismantle them and promote the chinese product as an alternative which was created with the know how taken from the buyout . 
  western companies did it with romanian companies which were competing them on the international markets . 
  but as always there are way bigger whales than us europeans . 
  ok , same principles should apply for russian companies . 
  ofc not , but in romania there is organized crime just like everywhere else . 
  and u do n't need an exodus , just several gangs are enough to make some visible damage and to get a public outrage . 
  and you have to start again from scratch . 
  this is why it is fundamental that the mistakes which were done when fighting the crimes that took place in western europe , do n't repeat themselves ... 
  unfortunately for the organized crime this may prove just a new business opportunity . 
  i am hoping that bucharest / montreal anti crime units will collaborate and monitor closely the situation ... 
  maybe i misunderstood them , but they said that the purpose of wwii was fighting the bolshvism , and the only reason they conquered here and there was to protect them from this new vicious ideology aka tough love baby ... 
  if we abuse it , they will reintroduce them , from what i read in our national media . 
  so lets hope for the best ...

  a better metric will be in 2017 , when we will a clear trend . 
  ofc some will still want to come to try their luck , others maybe will go to other countries . 
  hard to tell what will happen . 
  the august metric still reflects a pre brexit situation . 
  because europeans are filthy gay warmongering fascists with imperialistic tendencies who have forgotten god and do usa 's bidding !, 
   britain has to trade openly with europe , and vice versa . 
  a soft brexit is the only way to do that , and avoid a race to the bottom is it me or he obviously forgot the elephant in the room , free trade comes in a package with free movement . 
  sorry i am color blind ... 
  i know what investopedia says . 
  and even the example they give is biased since it 's more an example of inheritance tax ( which is indeed double taxation ) . 
  and i disagree with their opinion on the matter . 
  also i know the difference between a creditor ( a bank or an investor who buys company bonds - and where there is both principal and interest / coupon rate ) and equity owners . 
  but fundamentally is the same thing , there is only a difference of risks and payouts . 
  remember that an equity owner can always sell the company and get his principal back at a premium or at a loss and can choose if he wants his interest today as dividends or he wants to capitalize it in the equity he owns ( reinvested profit - in some countries it is taxed with 0 % ) . 
  i explained to you the philosophy based on which i consider taxing both the company and the shareholder as fair and in accordance with the social contract . 
  we can agree to disagree on the matter , but do n't challenge my understanding of the economic concepts . 
  just replace your typical shareholders with another company who specializes in buying and selling equity and you will see that taxing both entities for their specific gains makes sense . 
  actually this might benefit ireland because of how the algorithm weights assets , labor and revenues .

  you 're not a very impartial observer if you do n't agree with the following statement : leavers hate the eu more than eu citizens hate the uk . 
  the amount of `` vitriol '' targeted at the uk is in no way comparable to the insults and lies told for years and years by the leave campaign . 
  that 's because norway is an actual well established democracy unlike many of the other oil wealthy nations . 
  it 's actually all our problem and this attitude of fuck everyone else we 'll do whatever we please whenever we please it is honestly disgusting and extremely insulting . 
  you 've been a part of the eu for decades and have joined in a time of economic crisis for the uk , you 've benefited immensely from the union and now you 're hellbent on shitting in your own kitchen but also taking a piss in everyone else 's kitchen as well . 
  no , we have n't . 
  all i saw was really butthurt people about the eu insulting us all and calling the eu the 4 ` th reich . 
  i 've literally never seen anyone hate the uk in a way in which leavers hate the eu . 
  the only consistent thing in what you said is that you 're a racist idiot and you 're doing it again . 
  why would i do that ? 
  nothing wrong with talking about slavery or any other historic issues . 
  you know what is wrong ? 
  being a racist fuck for what happened 200 years ago . 
  really really is n't a hard concept to understand . 
  that 's likely ... / s, 
  this is n't a good sign at all . 
  if he fired them them because they were n't willing to do some things , guess what that means ? 
  purge in this sense is used because it 's abnormal to fire so many officers like that , it 's used in the sense of `` abrupt '' . 
  i do n't know who 's stupid , me or the people holding on to grudges from centuries ago . 
  oh , wait , i do know ... it 's the people hating other people because of that bad thing that happened ( as it always does ) 100 , 200 , 500 , or 1000 years ago . 
   you had your comment deleted yesterday by a moderator for spewing your racism accusations so do n't start again 2 sentences later :  congratulations you leftist nazi . 
  lol . 
  i expect nothing less of you than this comedy show . 
   female in mid 30s here . 
  was groped few times on public transport as a teenage girl . 
  sexually assaulted twice in my 20s in a middle of the day in public area , both time by men of indian/pakistani origin which made me despise them . 
  this is a quote directly from your comment history . 
  tell me more about how you 're not a racist ... oh sorry ... 
  i guess the politically correct them you 're looking for is xenophobe , since you despise people based on their ethnicity rather than race . 
  that 's not better and still very much racism in a colloquial sense . 
  oh and the post was n't deleted because i said you are racist , that 's pretty much a verifiable and provable thing even in a court of law given the evidence . 
  it was deleted because i used certain words i 'd rather not use again just so people can see who they 're dealing with . 
  in your mind , how does that explain the fact that people who actually live there are less anti-muslim than the people that have most likely never come in contact with them besides the news they read ? 
  you really do lack basic logic , do n't you ? 
  not that i expect a racist to have any logic , `` look , some people with brown skin did something bad , all brown skinned men must be bad amirite '' . 
  racist logic . 
  it is when you 're trying to establish whether that was the actual cause or simply a symptom of a failing economy . 
  if that counts as a fact to you , i 'm worried about your critical thinking skills . 
  economies do n't absorb `` loss of industry to asia '' , jobs are created and destroyed every day , whole industries die out while others are born and grow . 
  that 's exactly the point , there are some countries where the economy has not been doing well , attributing that to losses in some industries is however a very incomplete `` fact '' that paints the wrong picture . 
  what exactly did you prove wrong ? 
  you proved him wrong with the fact that some countries have had 15 % unemployment ? 
  you 're beyond ridiculous at this point . 
  some other countries had unemployment under 6 % , so how does that exactly win an argument ? 
  the point of the discussion is that maybe the countries suffering from 15 % + unemployment have other problems besides what 's being attributed to globalization . 
  this is n't philosophical , it 's me trying to show you step by step in a logical manner why your counter-argument is not really a good argument , but rather a correlation that does n't even stand up in the face of scrutiny . 
  or you know , the much simpler explanation of eastern europeans only getting their exposure to muslims through the sensationalist and fearmongering media . 
  remember ebola anyone ? 
  also some plane crashes last year . 
  oh and the h2n1 . 
  terrorists . 
  you name it , the media will make it look like your life is in immediate danger just so they get you to watch more of their news . 
  people need to get some perspective . 
  actually , it can be . 
  but , disregarding that , an economy the size of italy should be able to create way more jobs than it currently is , it 's clear there are systemic failures in their policies and economy , but it 's way easier to be a populist that blames globalization or immigrants rather than solve those problems . 
  but really , there 's no point in debating this if your mind is so made up about why southern europe is doing badly , even though there 's clear examples literally all around that this is more of a localized problem rather than a general one for the developed world . 
  your post amounts to `` southern europeans are a great and proud people and they deserve a better economy '' . 
  you should learn to make the difference between criticizing bad economic policies or the state of their political class and insulting people . 
  i can criticize the corruption in italy without my words being twisted into whatever you 're trying to twist them to . 
  it 's pretty self-evident they have a huge corruption problem in south especially , yet you 're going to tell me that does n't have anything to do with their poverty ? 
  yes but at least part of why a lot of people are working below their educational level is because there was a big inflation of diplomas especially in the soft-sciences and business or art related fields in the last decade . 
  simply put a lot of people have went to college to get a diploma , but the market ca n't provide nowhere near the amount of jobs required for all of them . 
  that 's especially true for certain areas such as finance . 
  things are getting better currently , not worse . 
  the economy is slowly recovering after 2008 . 
  there are n't enough jobs being created , but that 's an issue far more complex than just companies opening factories in china , it has a lot to do with today 's economic context , start from 2008 onward . 
  things will get better , then they will get worse again , such is the nature of the economy . 
  itt : people on reddit thinking western europeans should be more like eastern europeans . 
  the world has turned upside down . 
  also , people are retarded . 
  maybe you and the people you know are all unemployed or something , but i 'm pretty sure most have a job . 
  how about when half a dozen are but many more are n't . 
  how do you explain that ? 
  looking at southern european countries with a critical eye and saying `` nope , national governments are n't at fault '' shows how little you know . 
  ooor , maybe just maybe it 's because those people make up their mind about muslims based on extreme isolated incidents that get reported in the media and having never met an actual muslim they go with the generalizations they draw based on what they see in a newspaper instead of realizing most are just people like everyone else . 
  it would be great for all of us if we could have a closer relationship with russia , unfortunately that will never happen unless they get a real democracy or a pro-west leader . 
  15 % + unemployment where ? 
  even today there are developed countries with low unemployment just as there are developed countries with very high unemployment , why do you think that is ? 
  maybe the fault does n't all lie in globalization , maybe the national governments of those countries are n't really doing a proper job . 
  predicting something will happen does n't automatically make it a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
  it 's the logical and rational conclusion . 
  of course people are worried , most people with an idea about the world would be , a brexit has consequences and people are responding to that . 
  what you 're saying is that `` maybe if people did n't know the consequences they 'd be all cheery instead '' . 
  which is a blatant lie considering that this was an attack motivated by horniness and not hate towards any group of people . 
  your level of reading comprehension is what i would expect from a moron that says shit like this :  the reason why merkel is getting all the hate is because her decision has personally affected germans and europeans . 
  blair 's military interventions have n't affected any of us . 
  her decision was stupid , selfish , impulsive , illogical and undemocratic . 
  people would hate her less if she said `` listen guys , i fucked up '' , but she wo n't . 
  oh , and this gem right here :  female in mid 30s here . 
  was groped few times on public transport as a teenage girl . 
  sexually assaulted twice in my 20s in a middle of the day in public area , both time by men of indian/pakistani origin which made me despise them . 
  ok , we get it , you hate people from that part of the world because of your own personal negative experiences with them that have reinforced your prejudices . 
  now realize your own biases and how they affect your worldview and think twice before saying retarded stuff like what blair did was less hate worthy than merkel saying she will help the refugees because the bombs fell on the brown people you despise . 
  good for you , a lot of people have a problem with the sentence the judge gave , i 'm not a mind-reader so i made an assumption . 
  there 's a good reason why asylum seekers can not be deported though , not before the asylum request is denied anyway , it 's because our laws do n't allow us to deport people in places that their life might be in danger or they might be subjected to torture etc. 
  our system of law does n't tolerate such things so we ca n't willingly or by claiming ignorance send them back to such places . 
  i 'm not covering for rapists you imbecile , i 'm simply claiming that had it been a native , he likely would 've gotten the same punishment , as per the law in germany . 
  as for answering your questions about visas or expulsions , asylum seekers can not be expelled , it 's the law . 
  again , you seem to have a problem with the law itself , because the judge was doing his job of applying it . 
  gusy , far-right propaganda is turning people into idiots , let 's give in to that propaganda !,

  in all polls , a possible unification with romania is not supported by the majority . 
  < joke  decaf romanians < / joke , 
   irina walker , also known as irina kreuger , is the third daughter michael , the last king of romania . 
  on the list of top 100 british royals , she is 95th in succession to queen elizabeth . 
  king michael is the great-great grandson of queen victoria and third cousins with the queen . 
   michael jackson , ozzy osbourne , metallica , lenny kravitz , whitesnake , iron maiden -- the list of touring rock stars who do n't know the difference between bucharest and budapest seems to grow every year . 
  following a trend started back in 1992 by michael jackson , so many musicians playing romania 's capital have mistaken it for hungary 's and come on stage shouting `` how are you doing , budapest ? '' that locals have moved on from amused indulgence to being seriously pissed off . 
  before the crises the country has 7-8 year of substantial economic grow : https://www.google.ch/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:rom&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=romania%20gdp while clearly there 's much work to be done , there was a huge progress . 
  romanian ? 
  ah . . so you 're gypsy !, 
  is vuk karadzic related with the other well known karadzic ? 
  romanian : vulgar latin with a huge slavic influence and a significant amount of french/italian loanwords . 
  some interesting characteristics : - having suffix articles and declensions creates bizarre looking words like copilului ( = of the child ) - i know a phrase which is pronounced almost the same in portuguese and romanian and has the same meaning : `` cu carne de vaca nu se moare de foame '' - ( one ) can not die of hunger with cow ( beef ) meat - we use the same word for `` sea '' ( like the black sea ) and `` big '' = mare . 
  pointing the true is always relevant !, 
   what do you mean ? 
  are you saying it 's a coincidence the name romanians choose to call their nation is exactly the same as the name of the byzantine empire , from a linguistic perspective , choosing romania as the name of the country was quite obvious . 
  the people were calling themselves `` ruman '' or `` roman '' well before the creation of the state . 
  adding the `` ia '' termination for the name of the country is used in many other cases ( rus ** ia ** , bulgar ** ia ** , grec ** ia ** )  do you have any reliable sources that show the romanians living in wallachia called themselves that or that people outside the principality itself referred to it as such before the 1800 's ? 
  do n't forget that moldavia and transylvania existed alongside wallachia as well . 
  neac\u0219u 's letter ( from 1521 ) used the name `` romanian land '' ( c\u011bra rum\u016dn\u011bsk\u016d ) for wallachia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neac%c8%99u%27s_letter ) . 
  cazania lui varlaam ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cazania_lui_varlaam ) is another document from 17th century which uses the term `` romanian '' to refer to the people living in moldova . 
  other sources ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/name_of_romania ) :  other first-hand evidence about the name romanians used to call themselves comes from authors having lived in transylvania and/or romanian principalities : the transylvanian saxon johann lebel confirms in 1542 that common romanians call themselves `` romuini '' , [ 8 ] orichovius ( stanislaw orzechowski ) notes as late as 1554 that `` in their own language , romanians are called romini , after the romans , and walachs in polish , after the italians '' , [ 9 ] anton verancsics writes around 1570 that romanians living in transylvania , moldavia and walachia call themselves romans ( romanians ) [ 10 ] and martinus szent-ivany cites in 1699 romanian expressions : `` sie noi sentem rumeni '' ( modern standard romanian '' \u015ei noi suntem rom\u00e2ni '' ) and `` noi sentem di sange rumena '' ( in modern standard romanian `` noi suntem de s\u00e2nge rom\u00e2n '' ) [ 11 ] the idea that romanians descend from romans is much older than the 19th century national movement ( which clearly overemphasized it ) . 
   it 's interesting how a small number of people just decided that the country should be named romania , and not dacia . 
  well , people where calling themselves romanians ( `` roman '' or `` ruman '' ) long before the creation of the romanian state . 
  choosing romania as the name of the country was quite normal from a linguistic perspective . 
  the `` dacian '' hypothesis is pure nonsense . 
  bad comparison !, 
  i really do n't get why some many people are focus on schengen . 
  it 's really not that important . 
  ok , airport transit would take a little let , by that 's about it . . 
  corruption is not the real reason . 
  read further down the article . 
   interior minister p\u00e4ivi r\u00e4s\u00e4nen rejected claims that finland 's stance is coloured by the persistent problem of eastern european roma beggars in finnish cities . 
  year right ... of course , it 's not politically correct for them to say that they do n't like the roma . 
  no different than germany/austria banning nazi parties . 
  romanian citizen can freely travel all over europe even now . 
  next year the right to work will be also be granted . 
  it might seem racist , but i really doubt that roma will go anywhere in europe looking for jobs . 
  they only reason there are no ( native ) roma in germany is the nazi regime . 
  maybe it would actually be an historical justice to have germany integrate the roma population . 
  stupidquestionsredux : stop creating new accounts !, 
  we all know it 's you !, 
  since , inside the eu , anybody can travel without restrictions to any other country , dividing the number of residents to the number of arrests ( for a particular nationality ) makes no sense . 
  i really doubt that most roma beggars/scammers are in any way officially registered . 
  http://www.atlasofeuropeanvalues.eu/new/europa.php?ids=53&amp;year=2008 so 6 % of turks would n't like to have muslims as neighbours . 
  since 99 % of turks are muslim this seems highly unlikely ... 
  most of `` romanian '' mafia it 's actually roma . 
  and most romanians see them as a different ethnicity ( for example , they speak a different language ), 
  romanies are around 5 % of the population of romania . 
  all western countries were accusing us that we 're discriminating against them for decades ... 
  on the other hand italians have been a clearly much more `` effective '' exporters of crime world-wide and the general opinion of them is positive . 
  ea este datoare a pl\u0103ti pe preo\u0163ii bisericilor sale '' english : basically states that the `` comunes '' ( cities , villages ) have the duty to take care of the church and to pay the priests, 
  ea este datoare a pl\u0103ti pe preo\u0163ii bisericilor sale '' ( and this is iorga , not wikipedia ) now you could argue that the church gets too much . 
  i totally agree !, 
  the reality is that churches receive money from the state in most european countries . 
  this should be changed . 
  i agree !, 
  but starting with probably the most religious country from eu might to be the best strategy ... 
  i really like the swiss system . 
  you are asked to declare you religion . 
  if your church is officially recognized , the state takes a percent of your income and give it to the church . 
  if you declare yourself an atheist , you do n't pay anything . 
  at that time , there was a `` tradition '' for the rich people to donate land to the church . 
  while i agree with them , i also think the other side has a valid argument : the orthodox church used to be extremely rich until the 19th century . 
  they owned around 20 % of the country 's arable land . 
  a reformer ( cuza ) just confiscated all this land and gave it to peasants . 
  as compensation , the state `` promised '' the church that it would take care of its financial needs . 
  romania transylvania : slow , ( too ) polite , kind of stupid , but also more `` civilized '' bucharest : extremely rude , arrogant moldova : poor , lazy oltenia ( in southern romania ) : speaking alot and at a fast pace , not to be trusted szekely land : they do n't want to speak romanian ; you can not even buy bread without asking in hungarian, 
  the title is absolutely correct !, 
  gypsies will steal no jobs ... that 's actually the very last thing in their mind . 
  the it is doing actually quite well in romania the salaries are really decent . 
  not huge , but decent ( 1500 to 2000 euro/month after tax , for a good c/c + + developer ) . 
  not a problem if you 're orthodox !, 
  actually , i think it 's actually mandatory to be married if you want to be a priest . 
  i do n't know any unmarried priest . . 
  1994 fifa world cup ( usa ) was rather successful . 
  the total travel distances were probably longer . 
  euro also written in cyrillic . 
  nice !, 
  bulgarians must feel special . 
  i would not call ionesco a romanian writer . 
  most of his work was written in french and only translated in romanian . 
  the `` nationality '' of the writer is the language ( s ) he writes in ... 
  let 's not forget about titulescu !, 
  romania 1 . 
  brasov ( maybe also stop at the bran castle on the way ) 2 . 
  peles castle 4 . 
  sighisoara if you 're driving , do n't miss the transfagarasan highway, 
  you 're trolling . . right ? 
  how can you `` force '' others to unify with you if they do n't want ? 
  pig fat . . really !, 
  pig fat !, 
  the main reasons : * most moldavians do n't want !, 
  the russians managed to convinced them that they are different than romanians * many romanians oppose the potential unification because moldavians are significant poorer and also we 're not doing so well ourselves . 
  things might change in the future !, 
  all moldavians are now able to get the romanian citizenship ( even if they do n't live in romania ) . 
  the younger generations are clearly more `` european '' . 
  also , their education system seems to be pro-romanian ( in some ways ) ; they study in school , for example , the romanian history ( not only moldavian ) . 
  there 's a really funny movie about then romanian/moldavian relations : wedding in bessarabia ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1741706/ ), 
  was n't ireland in a similar situation maybe 100 years ago ?

  as i 've said many times , africa is in it 's current situation more because of the cold war proxies , rather then colonialism , all though colonialism played a big part . 
  it 's the fast decolonization that destroyed the countries , their political institutions were not build for democracy or even governing , as they inherited the colonial systems , which purpose was control and exploitation . 
  a slow decolonization , starting with more and more autonomy would have been the best course of action . 
  sadly it was n't possible . 
  some journalists say that besides the revolution , these are the biggest manifestations in romanian history !, 
  let 's hope !, 
  got a bit depressed earlier in the day , few people in the capital , but thankfully everything went fine and the people came !, 
  simply amazing !, 
  300k in all the country !, 
  150k in the capital alone !, 
  great numbers !, 
  on a side-note : the church , who is in psd 's pockets have denounced these changes to the law . 
  pretty big deal , the church rarely breaks with psd on issues . 
  started a bit slower , but we quickly got yesterdays numbers . 
  the capital 's a bit less today but the other cities have record turnout . 
  extremely peaceful as well , no violence so far , hopefully there will be none . 
  they 're hellbent on destroying the justice system , outside presure is good and welcomed . 
  they do n't care about the people, 
  i meant now , not at the elections . 
  dragnea , grindeanu and plumb kept yelling how they 'll raise everything yesterday , salaries , pensions . 
  how they 'll give students free transport . 
  at night 200k were in the streets , not accepting these bribes . 
  and seeing how 61 % of romanians did n't vote , i 'll say yes , the bribes did n't work for the majority of romanians . 
  the opposition simply failed to convince people to come out . 
  they do have former communists yes . 
  but their hardly true believers . 
  it 's the drive for power that they believe in . 
  their convinced capitalists if they can profit from it . 
  also very progressive of them , trying to ban gay marriage all together and having the church in their pocket . 
  i 'm a right-winger i criticized left-wing parties all my life , from numerous countries psd is not left-wing . 
  yes, 
  sadly so far turnout in the capital is lower '' only '' 40k as of right now . 
  on the good side , turnout in the other cities is about the same or in some cases bigger . 
  they are supporting a referendum to ban gay marriage proposed by the church . 
  the article is utter crap , the person who wrote it knows nothing of romanian politics . 
  psd has both left-wing and right-wing economical policies , many time contradictory , only thing they care is how good it sounds as a slogan . 
  whatever the results . 
  a great civic spirit was born these days . 
  for the first time , people did n't fail for the electoral bribes , did n't go in the streets because of low salaries/pensions and did n't go out there because they hate 1 person . 
  they went there for a principal and to defend their rights and what is morally right . 
  their a populist-conservative party with no ideology . 
  they yell for both bigger pensions/salaries and lower taxes, 
  many came with children yesterday , after the clashes they might not bring them out . 
  many do n't have anyone to let them with , so they may stay at home . 
  if it 's peaceful today i expect more tomorrow , and especially in the weekend . 
  note : this is for the capital , turnout in other cities is said to be even bigger . 
  there could be couple paid agitators . 
  but honestly , most were just plain idiots . 
  at the romania-poland game last year the rapid fans , threw torches so the federation would get fined , they were angry rapid was relegated . 
  after the violent outbursts from barbaric retards , protests will tone down ... people be afraid to go out . 
  they 'll '' sacrifice '' someone , tone down the bill , the amnesty one most likely . 
  and that 's it . 
  this is n't really my style so forgive me . 
  i swear to fucking god , football ultras need to just die . 
  i fucking hate them , 700 retarded people ruining 150k peoples peaceful protests . 
  this is n't really my style so forgive me . 
  i swear to fucking god , football ultras need to just die . 
  i fucking hate them , 700 retarded people ruining 150k peoples peaceful protests . 
  no idea , really . 
  i 'm not from the capital but it 's easly around 0c, 
  dragnea , our de facto leader and mastermind behind this , has n't been seen anywhere today all day . 
  the justice minister refused to take questions from the press , just kept saying how '' everything we did is legal '' tariceanu , dragneas ally , kept saying , shaking and in a silent voice : '' w-we won the election , it-it 's the parliament that 's sovereign , in a democracy the street does n't decide ! '', 
  they 're pissing themselves . 
  100.000 in the capital alone now . 
  biggest protests since the revolution !, 
  turnout was 39 % . 
  they also never mentioned these things during campaign . 
  i know lots of psd voters , mostly older people , who are very angry at these actions . 
  it 's hard to sell even to their own semi-brainwashed supporters . 
  i mean , these are usually either old people or from the poorer parts of romanian society , they are not happy that psds first actions are saving their friends and making sure the justice system ca n't do anything . 
  they voted for psd for bigger pensions/salaries and fewer taxes , they already backtracked on many of those as well ... no one voted for amnesty and cripling the justice system . 
  i 'm a convinced pacifist and believer in non-violent resistance . 
  but we should just throw them in trash bin and make them sign their resignation like the ukrainians did ... 
  funny story dragnea , our de facto leader went as a tourist to meat trump . . 
  voter turnout is everything . 
  psd got 40 % of votes with a 39 % turnout . 
  problem is that pnl , is in disarray too , and full of corruption as well , they do preach of anti-corruption and all that though , psd no longer even bothers . 
  usr is new and ca n't really predict how well they 'll do . 
  but one thing i 'm certain , they are unable to lead a government , they are a purely '' anti-system '' / '' anti-corruption '' party , they have left wingers , right wing conservatives , they 'll never have a governing platform . 
  at most they can support pnl , who will actually govern . 
  anyways , we are in deep shit . 
  i predict they 'll try to go the orban route, 
  you 're right , sadly , you are right . 
  the harm is already done . 
  it stops the current investigation , of course ... he still has the old sentence though , not really sure if he can be pm . 
  it does n't matter though , they got what they wanted , their free . 
  can he do it ? 
  i do n't think he has that power . 
  the memes have gone to far . 
  oh no , i do n't want dragnea to get shot . 
  oh no , let him live long and well , in jail . 
  so glad to see people of all backgrounds , all ages , protesting today . 
  i was a bit '' envious '' seeing all those protests in poland , i thought will never have something like this here and that psd will just do whatever it pleases . 
  if anything , at least we gave dragnea a huge slap in the face , he started acting like a god damn dictator lately , thinking he 's above everyone . 
  they have no choice really , if they do n't pass amnesty it will get them too in 1 year , at most . 
  dragnea , tariceanu and countless others would be saved by this amnesty . 
  if it does n't pass they ' l be destroyed for them it 's all or nothing . 
  protests in romania are really rare . 
  50k in the capital is massive , for us . 
  this is one of the few moments that truly makes me proud of this country .

  if you 're not there waiting for them in the first place fewer will even try . 
  during winter conditions are much harsher and yet you do n't see a tenfold increase in casualties . 
  maybe because humans use common sense , assesses the risk and do n't even try ? 
  and also again , for nth time , i did n't say to not save them . 
  their goal is not to be saved , that 's just a step , their goal is europe . 
  if all who try and up saved and then on african shore instead of europe , all 100 % , none makes it to europe whatsoever eventually they 'll stop trying . 
  most of them anyway . 
   the statistics report only on those whose bodies were found . 
  the mediterranean sea is a big place . 
  there are lots of improvised boats that never made it . 
  bro , if we would have 500k dead we would have our shores full with dead bodies . 
  you would n't see so many parent with their children on the sea if chances would be 50/50 . 
   it 's not the ngos who traffic them . 
  yes they do . 
  in collusion with smugglers that provides the boats . 
   do you claim that ngos put them in those boats ? 
  their buddies on shore do that , and then tell them were to be to pick them . 
   you are spreading misinformation and hate fueled propaganda . 
  right . 
  because i have a brain and see whats going on . 
  and because you constantly say that what i 'm saying is let them drown . 
  you hear only what you want to hear , put word in my mouth , make a nice straw man , and then ofcourse you have the argument to tell me that i spread hate . 
  gtfo . 
   if you stop those that try to help the immigrants from drowning but this is not the only thing that they do . 
  they go there and wait for them . 
  and after they are saved they do n't go on a nearest port , on afrikan coast , you know ... where saved people came from . 
  stop saying that i 'm against saving them . 
  i 'm against the combination of all their actions taken together . 
  wait for them , save , bring them in europe . 
   you need to be a special kind of asshole to try to stop medics from doing their job . 
  is it their job to scour the sea for people drowning ? 
  i though that 's coast guard responsability . 
  is it medecins sans frontieres responsability to bring them in europe instead of leaving them on african shore after they save them . 
   cities like stuttgart have over 40 % of their population with migrant descent . 
  should we deport them as well ? 
  what 's your point ? 
  you said to stop the root cause , i showed what is the root cause ( and how hard is to fix it ) and then you come with this unrelated example . 
  and btw , forgot to say it , is not our responsability to fix their problems in the first place . 
  we did n't cause them . 
   there 's nothing stopping you from deporting them after they are rescued from drowning yeah , actually there are a few things . 
  logistics , willingness of other countries to cooperate , and all that after you even know where each person `` who lost his id '' should be deported . 
  that is if you even can keep track of them , cause right now they are not kept in closed camps , they can and most do roam free in schengen . 
   how is saving people from drowning an incentive for smuggling immigrants ? 
  are you serious ? 
  lower/higher risk is a big factor when a decision to navigate the sea is taken . 
  saving people lowers the risk therefore higher incentive . 
   you should try taking the trip yourself and see what chances of surviving you have without these ngos quite high based on statistics . 
  hundreds of thousands ( maybe  1mil total in last years ) vs thousands drowned . 
  do the math . 
   it only shows your hatred towards ** illegal ** immigrants . 
  and just because i do n't want them here does n't mean that i hate them . 
  i do n't want the whole 1bilion indians or chinese to move in europe also . 
  does n't mean that i hate them . 
  what i hate is these ngos who traffic people from the height of their high white horse . 
   i think the russians said last year they said that a while ago also . 
  problem is russian word does n't mean anything , you would have to be an imbecile to believe a word coming from their mouth . 
   our policy is to prevent our services being used by companies whose activities promote hatred , violence or racial intolerance . 
  because being against illegal immigration and human trafficking ( which is what 's happening , and the purpose of that fundraising was to prevent that ) means hatred , violence and racial intolerance . 
  right ? 
  you are right the state was n't implicated in this though . 
  at least not publicly . 
   you are spreading misinformation . 
  about state implication in this ? 
  yes . 
  for the rest of what i said i hold my ground . 
   the ngos are n't the ones putting the immigrants on boats no . 
  they travel many hundreds of miles up to 12 miles from lybian shore ( maybe even closer after they get an sos ) , they pick up people who are about to drown ( this not being an accident but a planed phase of their jurney ) and then instead of leaving them in closest port they travel all the way back in italy . 
  if this is not human trafficking ... . 
  you 're making it sound like this ships were just minding their businsess and then suddenly they stumble on people nedding help . 
  their whole mission purpose is to go and pick these people to transport them in italy . 
  they reached the level where they actually race lybian coastguard to reach first the sosing boat . 
   instead of tackling the problem at its source cause is a piece of fucking cake to educate and raise out of poverty hundreds millions of afrikans . 
  these are the reasons which most of them are there , not wars . 
   people go after the organizations that save lives and bring them to europe to stay illegally here . 
  this is a major part of what 's happening there , not something that you simply can ignore like you just did . 
   instead of fighting the human traffickers , `` defend europe '' goes after humanitarian ngos . 
  humanitarian ngos became human traffickers at this point . 
  this is what they do . 
  wake the fuck up . 
   that 's stupid and dangerous because it does n't solve the problem and it endangers people 's lives . 
  stupid is to give people incentives to try this trip . 
  removing these incentives it the right thing to do . 
  if people would know they have 99 % chance to drown trying this trip almost all of them would stop trying and we would n't be in this mess in the first place . 
   spite financial institutions shutting down many methods of donation the moment when state does n't protect borders and shuts down or impedes whoever tries to do so while at the same time does n't do anything to organizations who essentially transformed into human traffickers and breaks the law constantly . 
  wonders of the world we live in . 
  was n't supposed to be gay 's fault ? 
   yeah , like that 's an option with the current government . 
  did n't 1 million ukrainians immigrated in poland in last 2-3 years ? 
  could n't your host buy 2 beers ? 
  if you want comparison do it with croatia . 
  usually they are not far ahead . 
  romania : data missing or not presented due to small sample sizes, 
  not sure which joke made you post this here : 1 ) australia participates in eurovision therefore they are in europe . 
  2 ) australia is mini germany . 
  that since you do n't have an actual constitution is pretty much of for interpretation . 
  that parlament is actually bypassed and parlament can not even make a legislation that contradicts eu 's legislation, 
   uk constitution `` the united kingdom does not have one specific constitutional document named as such . 
  instead , the so called constitution of the united kingdom is a sum of laws and principles that make up the body politic of the uk . 
  this is sometimes referred to as an `` unwritten '' or uncodified constitution . '', 
   a process has been sent up that results in parliament giving it 's tacit approval to direct effect so as to appear as if it has been bypassed `` under european law , as developed by the ecj , the ec treaty created a `` new legal order '' under which the validity of european union law can not be impeded by national law ; though the uk , like a number of other eu members , does not share the ecj 's monist interpretation unconditionally , it accepts the supremacy of eu law in practice .

  there 's actually a story to that . 
  many gypsies were very skilled craftsmen in the past working in artisanal stuff in wood ( brooms for example was one of their signature products ) and in metal ( pots , pans , ovens and the sorts and most notably roofs made from metal foils ) when a gypsy craftsmen would build the roof to his house it made sure to add all the bells and whistles as a showcase to other of his capabilities , this is why they have these crazy roofs . 
  slowly these roofs became a staple of gypsy architecture . . 
  i like slavs except the russians . 
  even russians would be ok if they 'd chill the fuck down . . 
  you 're right . 
  it 's just the 80 % who are supporting putin . . 
  what 's that ? 
  only the ones that drink their coffee ... black . 
  want to be rich ? 
  be metal !, 
  greece found out the secret . 
  they 're trying to be more metal now . 
  eu fund gave mayors of cities , small towns and villages the chance to apply for funding for their projects directly circumventing the nefarious funds allocation of the governments . 
  a lot more shit has been done at the local level because of this . 
  another factor to be considered is the significant growth of the gdp between 2002 and 2016 which is being felt . 
  romania could turn out to be a smash hit of the eu in the region . 
  the eu needs this sort of case study to strengthen it 's soft power , fend off critics , curve extremism , tackle russian propaganda and influence in the area . 
  next year we will celebrate the 10th anniversary of eu membership . 
  compared to a decade ago the country shows profound transformations . 
  if it 's to stay the course , the eu will get it 's poster child . . 
  you 're on point . 
  the scale of corruption was and still is gigantic . 
  there are probably hundreds of thousands of people involved in some form or other . 
  this is the main reason romania and all the region as a matter lag behind so much compared to the west . 
  a large part of the vital funds needed for the modernisation of the country has been embezzled by slime like this . . 
  the circus is back in town . . 
  i think the church is at 51 % atm . 
  does n't matter though . 
  whatever they do they will get more and more irrelevant . . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's about smuggling people nowadays . 
  will they reorient the russian any stationed there too ? 
  lesser poland . 
  sounds like a great place . . 
  oh that 's easy for romania . 
  you only need on word and it starts with g. on a second note . 
  you can make pretty much anyone in europe mad by bringing it about . . 
  no , the rural part is mostly still fucked . 
  the big cities though are booming . . 
  fuck yeah portugal !, 
  bravo !, 
  isolated exceptions do not weaken the point . 
  do you have proof ? 
  romania decided they do n't want to be slav some time ago . . 
  police is a joke in western europe . 
  half a planet knows it . 
  that 's why they get rivers of delinquents from all over the world and shit like this from the islamists . . 
  not could . 
  romania at least is poised to no let it slide . 
  they make friggin ' iphones !, 
  we 're gonners !, 
  i was exiting the metro in milan in one of my trips and saw that it started to rain . 
  out o nowhere the tat vendors pulled out umbrellas . 
  they asked for 10 euros . 
  i ended up buying an umbrella for 3 . 
  if they 'd provide this kind of on demand service all the time i would not have anything against them . . 
  whoa !, 
  obviously you know what the fuck you 're talking about and obviously i 'm wrong . 
  thx for the details . . 
  because they are not intended solely as missile defense . 
  i am fairly certain they 're going to bring nukes in these stations . 
  to install them would be fairly easy . 
  now that does modify the balance of forces . . 
  math on a train !, 
  what the fuck is happening to the world ? 
  burn this filthy wizard !, 
  burn him in a public space !, 
  let the children watch !, 
  you do n't understand dude . 
  large territories of their countries wo n't be habitable for humans . 
  for the lulz !, 
  jokes aside i find russians to be very theatrical . 
  they seem to find a lot of significance in gestures like these . 
  i think they think they are intimidating . . 
  so ... umm . . berlin ? 
  no russians and americans this time . 
  they tend to trash the place . . 
  then there 's nothing else we can do but go out for a pint . 
  for the average joe ppp is all that matters . 
  a lot of the huge wealth in developed countries is concentrated in very few hands . . 
  welcome slovenia !, 
  did you bring beer ? 
  dude , budapest is the capital of hungary . 
  you were probably thinking of bucharest the capital of romania , or trolling . . 
  paris just embarassing everyone else  gorgeous !, 
  you are welcomed mr timmermans !, 
  yes you do . 
  for herd imunity and to prevent epidemics like the one currently happening in romania due to antivaxers and the drop in vaccination rate . . 
  yeah but who does n't like it 's own pula ? 
  you 're way , way wrong . 
  you try to cherrypick some half assed arguments when all the countries that ended up joining the eu are way better off than those that stayed behind . 
  the eu is serbia 's future , no way around it . 
  there 's something of with the tests . 
  it might be possible for example that some countries curriculums are set in such a way that they favor better results or viceversa . . 
  oh , we do have a bunch , where you 've been the last 3 months ? 
  yeah , but the turks did n't split berlin in half for half a century . . 
  we 're talking about the berlin that was split in 2 by the russians . 
  it 's deeper than recent events, 
  but putin has the support of the majority of russians . 
  what is the percentage of people that support putin ?

  yes but their in their justice system proves are irrelevant . 
  she may very well could be just a `` isis bride '' like many girls from europe and not a criminal or a * sniper * . 
  i have a request for notmal in the head people . 
  please stop filling my inbox with sexual , racist and misogynistic curses !, 
  i may be wrong but that 's my opinion . 
  downvote me and forget me if you think i 'm wrong but do n't call me `` subhuman '' for emphasizing with a girl close to my age ( even if she 's a criminal ) . 
  thank you . 
  not many people have the same critical thinking like you and me unfortunately . 
  how many girls just all for a man who 'll sell them into prostitution ? 
  i think her case is similar only instead of prostitution she got jihadism and brainwashing . 
  many here want her dead and etc. . . 
  but they only know iraqi point of view and justice in iraq make out own ministry of justice looking like a star trek spaceship in front of a kayak . 
  you assumed wrong . 
  i do n't mind to see a white 25yo terrorist killed . 
  stupidest things were made by much older people . 
  one of it i guess it 's me writting on this thread and ending up with my inbox filled with `` you 're a subhuman '' by 20 days old accounts which post only on / r/altright lolol, 
  not if you 're a minor . 
  they 'll be able to do it tomorrow if they want that . 
  god forbids !, 
  allegedly in iraq does n't mean the same thing as here . 
  i know man but she 's a child . 
  look at her . 
  for god sake she even had my stature . 
  because she 's a minor . 
  i know . 
  but i 'm still a little confused about my feelings . 
  she may not be a toddler but she definitely is n't an adult either . 
  i do n't know ... she 's a kid . 
  yes but she 's a minor and a citizen of your country . 
  your own law ask you ( i hope ) to get her the hell out of there . 
  punish her in germany !, 
  yes i know . 
  but she 's way too young to pay with her life a damn stupid choice . 
  i guess since i 'm close to her age and a woman i kinda put myself in her place and it does n't feel great . 
  bring her home and then punish her according to our laws . 
  i mean we accepted 25yo jihadist men back so we can do it for a child !, 
  c'mon kristina ... she was n't a sniper more than i am . 
  and even if she was ( i know that would n't sound good ) she 's one of us and she should be tried in europe . 
  give her life imprisonment and call it a day but get her out of there !, 
  my opinion . 
  not according to people here who want to see her dead . 
  they are n't fighters when they 're prisoners . 
  especially a 16yo girl is not !, 
  i know i 'll be downvoted to death but i want her back home . 
  she really does n't deserve to be raped and shot or hanged in some hellhole in iraq only because she 's stupid . 
  she could be sentenced to death there !, 
  bring her home . 
  she 's stupid but she does n't deserve to die !, 
  hmmmm ... 
  of course not . 
  romanian brown bears are n't that lazy . 
  they can kill you ... not like those chinese lazy-arse pandas who eat bamboo and sleep all day long . 
  yes and tab\u0103r\u0103 in romanian . 
  fighting against the pope . 
  well , these are the people i like . 
  if they have a good reason to be there i can see why they 'll be a train ticket to the north even if it 's a little strange since i 'm the 90 's people from eastern europe were locked up in camps and deported back quite fast . 
  now these people are just free to roam wherever they want ? 
  oh do n't worry . 
  i know what you mean . 
  ol\u00e9, 
  okay ... so now what ? 
  they 'll be able to cross into continental spain without any kind of check ? 
  if it is n't true i 'm sure a spaniard will tell us . 
  i wish i could be able to do that too at ro-hu border : '' (, 
  and then they 'll accuse us for what those bears will do there . 
  instead romanians are gypsies it will be romanians are bears . 
  hmmmm ... 
  i think they could just move them in some reservations ( like they did with buffalos ) not kill them all . 
  my opinion of course . 
  and then we can say it is ~ ~ merkel 's ~ ~ may 's fault because she invite them !, 
  i know a shepherd who has his intestines out of his belly after a bear attack . 
  do n't underestimate them especially when they 're upset or hungry . 
  flair checks out , 
  inside the parliament would be better . 
  send the navy * sheeps * !!!, 
  they did their job against russians . 
  why did you assumed that form of life is hungarian ?!, 
  a comment so stupid even the most stupid comments i 've ever made looks like are made by a genius . 
  of course . 
  unfortunately . 
  it 's pretty much the same here too . 
  `` cucumbers '' and `` onion growers '' . 
  they try to enforce a law which exists in our country . 
  one of those laws our dear leaders try to make it obsolete now so they can legalize even more the theft from public money . 
  ummm ... are you a state employee ?!, 
  you sound like you know how these things work , 
  i 'll think about another thing next time . 
  they eat children and killed jesus . 
  gee ... do n't you know that already ? 
   turns out the nazis were ~ ~ inconsistent ~ ~ stupid af ftfy, 
  how can a human being with brains and everything ... be so damn f. . king stupid ?!, 
  i ca n't understand that !, 
  i just ca n't !, 
  i do n't know if that 's the case since most ( if not all of them ) where way too young back in the communist times . 
  not to mention that france is n't exactly a good example either . 
  unfortunately i could n't \u2702 those lovely of yours . 
  you wan na peel that for ya ? 
  honey ... how could you even have such a horrible thought ?!? 
  go to sleep my love ... . 
  that would make you drown ... my dear,

   they are mostly criminals living in `` camps '' of dirt and trash while they most likely have a higher than average crime rate , i doubt that * most * ( more than 50 % ) are criminals . 
  also , there are many integrated roma , that fly under the radar so to speak . 
  i 'm not aware of any interdiction . 
  it might be something that is not allowed for state institutions to some extent , but i know the soros foundation published research on [ unemployment and level of schooling among the roma ] ( http://www.soros.ro/?q=situa%c8%9bia-romilor-%c3%aen-2011-%c3%aentre-incluziune-social%c4%83-%c5%9fi-migra%c8%9bie ) . 
  so i think it 's allowed , at least for private institutions . 
  i ca n't say for crime rate , but i 'm pretty sure the level of incarceration is higher among the roma than the general public ( which is unsurprising given that poverty and lack of education correlate with higher crime-rate , especially in urban setting ) . 
  i 'll see what i can find on google . 
  i 'm not excusing anyone . 
  but there is a larger picture than just crime statistics . 
   edit : gypsies are gravely overrepresented in crime statistics here in sweden . 
  they are overrepresented in crime statistics in many central and south-eastern european countries as well . 
  they are also overrepresented in the poverty statistics , in the unemployment statistics , in the illiteracy and low-education statistics , and so on . 
   i wonder also whether you also consider germany , with its policy of granting citizenship to `` russlanddeutsche [ 3 ] '' , whose german ancestry is nearly as remote , and many of whom hardly speak any german , to also be a `` banana republic '' ( unlike spain , it is a republic , at least ) . 
  forget the russlanddeutsche . 
  how about the [ transylvania saxons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvania_saxons ) ? 
  they 've been in what is now romania since the 13 ^ th century . 
  not many left though . 
   i 'm guessing it 's because during communism religion was forbidden and often times people were tortured or killed for practicing it it 's a bit more complex than that , and it varied from country to country ( eastern europe is more than just the soviet union ) and from period to period . 
  also , some denominations had it harder than others . 
   especially after the state has invested in them and their education . 
  the state should keep investing in them if it wants to keep them . 
  and the healthcare system in general . 
  just as a general curiosity , in what line of work are you active ? 
  it 's both the financial aspect ( low wages ) and the rottenness of the system ( corruption , lack of fucks given by elder medical staff ) . 
  source : best friend is young doc who recently emigrated to germany . 
  there is common history after the hungarian sttlement in the carpathian basin as well ( afaik there were some inside the early hungarian kingdom who wanted to go with the patriarch of constantinopole rather than the patriarch of rome ) .

  maybe they do not want absolute sovereignty . 
  maybe they want to remove one administrative layer between themselves and bruxelles . 
   well as far as i 'm concerned on / r/europe [ 1 ] there has been general hostility towards scottish and catalan independence . 
  more so catalan independence . 
  the opinion here is hardly hostile towards scotland , and even for catalonia it 's still somewhat positive . 
  sure , it gets more comments and debate because it 's a one sided move ( unlike scotland ) , but the atmosphere is hardly hostile . 
   even the banner of / r/europe is basically the banner of the protest movement . 
  and that of the state itself . 
  just because the opposition uses the flag does not mean that flag is an exclusive symbol of the opposition ( as was/is the case in lybia or syria ),

   edit : snoo says `` happy sami national day '' . 
  how is it relevant ? 
  just changed it . 
  it had the ukrainian flag and it said * `` hot topic du jour : ukraine '' *, 
  agreed . 
  \u201e [ i do n't get no respect ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ff67z3iiju ) '', 
  some factors at play : * nationalism is seen as anathema to `` european values '' * nationalism is associated with communism here , and we learned during the 80s ' ( and [ early 90s ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_quadrilateral ) ) that nationalism does n't protect you from hunger , and makes you [ look more like a clown ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gheorghe_funar ) . 
  * speaking of the 90 's , we got a taste of what happens when nationalism goes wild [ in 1990 , in t\u00e2rgu mure\u015f ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_clashes_of_t%c3%a2rgu_mure%c8%99 ) . 
  as such , both the majority and the minority agreed that dialogue is the proffered way to go . 
  * as such , all `` conflict '' between majority and minority was dealt with through dialogue and political negotiations . 
  the [ hungarian minority party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/udmr ) has been a junior member of government , de facto or de jure , from 1996 to 2012 . 
  also each minority has one mp by default , so this ads another 18 ( iirc ) mps to parliament to voice concern if needed . 
  also , the greater romania party was effectively [ cordon sanitaire 'd ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cordon_sanitaire ) by the other parties . 
  * we have had a positive relationship with hungary , so that eased a lot of pressure off the issue . 
  * we have an [ anti-discrimination agency ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_council_for_combating_discrimination ) that shoots down any instance of discrimination * the sting of austerity was seen as an internal fuck-up , more than a foreign ( eu ) diktat . 
  but do n't go around thinking there is no nationalism or populism . 
  there is to some extent , but the virulent kind is quite marginal , compared to some other countries . 
  i encountered it in greece , where the pipes are too narrow . 
  my thought exactly . 
  greece ( or at least athens ) is the same . 
  spain is not a federal republic ( like germany ) . 
  it is a unitary state ( like poland ) , and as such , the privileges of autonomy are granted by the central government , unlike in the federal state , where the federal government is given power by the states . 
  the catalans want to switch to a federal model , whereby catalonia becomes a sovereign state , federalized with the rest of spain . 
  they do n't like the centralized model because they fear madrid could revoke their autonomy , and there is the added symbolic aspect where in a unitary state is subservient to madrid . 
  in a federal model , it is madrid who is given powers by catalonia , so in a sense , the roles are switched . 
  disclaimer : i 'm not catalan . 
   and i 'm tired of being labeled a thing that does n't actually exist . 
  no ethnicity `` exists '' as something objective . 
  `` american '' is just as subjective as `` romanian '' or `` hungarian '' . 
   it 's not until we leave america that we find out it 's a lie . 
  it 's not a lie , but the context changes . 
  `` italian '' makes sense within the us . 
  but your context is different now that you 're in finland . 
  for example , pakistani identifies as `` asian '' in the uk , but that label applies differently in the us , where `` asian '' means east asian . 
   so depending on person who asks i ' l tell different things .

  bad news dude , winter is coming . 
  pretty hard to live in a tent in the middle of the winter and also studying . 
  well , they ca n't even speak your language ... 
  that 's what he says ... 
  who would want to live in a third world country like denmark ? 
  come on guys , show some compassion . 
  it is , but these people are the ones that blow themeselves up for nothing . 
  the same ones that fight in a war . 
  compared with that , this is nothing . 
  it might be the rich , but equipment , food and other expenses are also high . 
  however , i do n't think they could do it with 2-300 people . 
  it 's just a lot less expensive to send x persons ( not important ones ) and if 30 % succeed , it 's still better than spending a lot of money on fake passports . 
  the guy looks older than me and i 'm 24yo . 
  without any kind of identification papers ? 
  it was 1 year [ suspended sentence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suspended_sentence ) so he did n't go to prison . 
  in fact , just last month became the president of the biggest political party . 
  i do n't think so , romania is the second poorest country in eu . 
  sounds like dreptate si adevar . 
  update from his lawyer :  said he was mandated to clarify that the mayor sorin oprescu has never asked anyone for money , either directly or through intermediaries , the defender adding that allegations of bribery of dna prosecutors are unfounded, 
  craiova is in dolj not olt . 
  uhm ... forced sterilizations ? 
  or prejudice , 
  in your first comment you implied that we are racists ( since a lot of swedes complained about this in other unrelated threads ) and i just explained that its not a simple as you might think . 
  and what do you think will happen when they will find out that they cant have a job ? 
  trust me , nothing good . 
  in order to change this culture , the only way is to focus on the children and their education . 
  the adults mentalities cant be changed , without impressive involvement on both sides . 
  in order to do so , all children living in toxic environments should be removed from that environment and taken care of by the government . 
  however , romania is not sweden and simply cant afford the costs . 
  we are not talking about 1k kids , but several hundres thousands . 
  instead of working with the romanian police , go on complaining , for sure that will change something . 
  also , keep giving money to the beggers , the human traffickers really need those new mansions . 
  catch up to what ? 
  we never did that to them . 
  the communists even tried to integrate them forcefully and failed . 
  they have the same rights like us and more . 
  they are here for hundreds of years just like the hungarian , tatar or other minorities . 
  its not our fault that their culture contradicts normal social values . 
  singing cumbaya and giving money its not the answer . 
  do i need to remind you that sweden sterilized their roma population 40 years ago ? 
  not even the romanian communists did that . 
  they have special places in every highschool and college , yet those places remain unoccupied or by kids with minimum grades required to pass.you might say that because they are poor , but even the poorest peasent sends his kids to highschool or college . 
  scumbags come in every color and nationality . 
  rasist germans !, 
  she was staying with her aunt that probably has a job in sweden . 
  in my opinion it does n't seem fair that although the aunt is paying taxes and contributions , her neece is not allowed to use that system . 
  even he kills someone or convicted for some serious shit ? 
  maybe he was just hungry . 
  still waaaay bigger than ours . 
  come on , everybody knows that women have too many rights . 
  how dare them walking on the streets without a man , even worse without a burka . 
  just shameful, 
  why should the europeans give up that right and not properly protect the outer borders ? 
  all eu members should chip-in protecting it . 
  refugee or not , people should not be allowed to willy-nilly cross the borders as they wish , crossing the entire fricking continent . 
  because russia did n't stop to mess around with other countries . 
  just because the urss fell , it does n't mean that soviet system left . 
  why even now the average russian thinks about urss as their golden years despite the fact that they literally killed millions of innocent people ? 
  i do n't remember seeing the germans saying about nazism the same thing . 
  countries joined nato by their own choice , it was n't imposed on them as the communism . 
  they were n't occupied like red army did . 
  russia has no right to influence our internal affairs or territory . 
   acknowledged . 
  it 's time to rent some kids !, 
  or to make loooove , since every european country has a problem with natality . 
   we 've got a ruling elite that has kept power from 1989 onward ( that 's 25 years , folks ) through a system of corruption , organized crime , a strict enforcement of mindless party loyalty and electoral fraud . 
  like every east european country . 
   1.2 billion eur on building a highway that 's really worth half as much the same thing is happening here too . 
   plus , these things are not only up to us - every time montenegro 's ruling elite was at a risk of losing power , it received political support from the us and the eu . 
  without this support , i 'm a 100 % certain , our long-awaited change of government would have already happened by now . 
  i highly doubt that . 
  if it was n't us/eu , it was russia or other country . 
   there 's a dictator in montenegro , and he 's able to keep pillaging my already impoverished country 's economy because of indifference on part of the international community - us and eu especially . 
  and you want us or eu to fix your problems ? 
  us and eu do n't care about corruption and people as long as montenegro is stable . 
   problem is more about a better distribution across european countries . 
  and leave to germany or sweden as soon as they arrive . 
  let say that for a country that 's not in shengen like mine it 's harder , but how about countries that are ? 
  how do you keep them when they can simply cross a border without checks ? 
   has any one of these idiots considered how nigeria is going to feed 1 billion people ? 
  humanitarian aid , of course . 
  then what 's the point of the borders when everybody can enter a country ? 
  it sounds nice and fluffy , but in practice eu ca n't do anything because they are sovereign countries . 
  for example , last month a business man was accused of bribing government officials to pass a gd specially created for himself , if it was n't for the eu that opposed it , that scumbag would succeded . 
  and what about those ski resorts in syberia ? 
  may i join you ? 
  safety is not what they are looking for . 
  by entering ilegally in a country , they demonstrate that they do n't give a shit about the laws . 
  yelling aloha snakbar also does n't help ; it 's not us that have to change , it 's them . 
  to be fair i always thought that all germans yodel, 
  never heard of that word before / s. 
   as someone who is considering moving to romania i want details .

  a bunch of overpaid crooks who do nothing but spew out stupid declarations , sleep while parliament is in session or feather their own nests . 
  so , all in all , negative . 
  our sports teams ( especially football ) do tend to have names like that . 
  case in point : fc unirea alba iulia ( union alba iulia-union of 1918 ) fc cfr cluj ( probably because team was funded by the state railway company ) fc universitatea cluj ( university of cluj ) fc viitorul constanta ( future constanta ; newer team that looks to the future instead of the past ... ? ), 
  fc gaz metan medias ( methane gas medias-city is near gas fields , was a center of those ) fc otelul galati - ( galati steel ; city is a major steel-producing center ) so , if they were to be even more americanized , they 'd follow a similar scheme i guess ; galati steelers ; alba iulia 18ers ; cluj railworkers ; timisoara polytechnicians ; bucharest red dogs and so on .

  earlier a festive treat , now it is part of everyday consumption . 
  k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs is made from sweet , yeast dough ( raised dough ) , of which a strip is spun and then wrapped around a truncated cone -- shaped baking spit , and rolled in granulated sugar . 
  it is roasted over charcoal while basted with melted butter , until its surface cooks to a golden-brown color . 
  during the baking process the sugar stuck on the k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs caramelises and forms a shiny , crispy crust . 
  the surface of the cake can then be topped with additional ingredients such as ground walnut or powdered cinnamon . '', 
  it 's very popular here at fairs . 
  no , it 's a pastry . 
  no , to be honest . 
  they do n't seem like they want in . 
  fine by me . 
  alba iulia-ora\u0219ul unirii ( union city-the union of transylvania with romania was proclaimed here on 1 december 1918 ) alcal\u00e1 de henares-ora\u0219ul rom\u00e2nilor ( rarely used , perhaps due to the concentration of romanians over there ), 
  as with other parts of the balkans , turkish soap operas are well-known over here . 
  m\u00fchtesem y\u00fczil ( suleyman magnificul in romanian ) was king over here during its run . 
  aside from it , bahar is relatively popular here . 
  aside from turkish soap operas , latino ones ( and more recently some korean and indian ones ) are relatively popular , having an entire channel dedicated to them . 
  not that i watch them myself , just stating a fact . 
  ( altough tbh i did end up watching part of an episode of a latino soap opera my grandma was a fan of , and i still hate ignac\u00edo because of it . ), 
  as a folk we generally are n't interestee in that . 
  if the average joe knew bout the us parties , he 'd say the democrats are somewhat centrist , and the reps are more conservative . 
  single , still not over a damn crush . 
  doubt we have those here . 
  it 's mostly normal ordering around these parts . 
  not to mention that some parliamentarians just sleep during meetings , or even watch porn ( well , that was a government guy if i remember but still ) . 
  some of them , like nicolicea , are there just to sleep . 
  nope , i dislike this actually . 
  i 'm a fan of the united states and believe that one can discuss sanely with donald , given time . 
  we 're barely within the first term and we 're already turning up the `` european chauvinism '' , whilist we 're nothing better than the us . 
  amen to you . 
  aside from the income tax , you have the vat , a tax on profits obtained by businesses , excises , social contributions , the car tax , and other local taxes ( buildings , land , means of transportation , and so on ) until now we had a pay-as-you-go system ; aside from the vat , they got deducted from the paycheck . 
  now , the social democratic ( re : mafia ) government wants to get rid of that and introduce a system akin to the us tax system . 
  sad . 
  i wanted a cut , but not like this . 
  nope , parliament does n't really give a damn . 
  yes . 
  mainly because of : going to work ( romanians going strawberry-picking in spain ) or going to an university and remaining there after you 're done . 
  a major problem imo . 
  assuming it happens , no . 
  they 'd be free to form a union of their own , and i doubt they 'd want in on this mess that we have . 
  plus , i 'd have nowhere to flee to if the us joins . 
  practically nonexistent , as the social-democratic party is just a party of crooks and thieves . 
  being that i am right-winged myself , i would n't have supported them either way .

  wot in tarnation . 
  we do n't even have those , and if we did , we 'd probably find it ridiculous . 
  spinners and kendamas are everywhere , especially among middle schoolers . 
  so , i 'd say it 's a pretty big craze . 
  the `` save romania union '' founded in 2016 , after the unexpected success of bucharest mayoral candidate nicusor dan and his `` save bucharest union '' party . 
  he decided to take it to the national level , trying to make it a `` big-tent '' - party . 
  but , after the election , cracks began to show , and the aforementioned nd eventually quit the party after the family referendum highlighted the dissension between the progressive and the conservative wings . 
  nope , ca n't recognize a thing . 
  and hungarian is just baszmegized turko-slavic . 
  well , similar to france i guess . 
  judge hands out the verdict after each side presents arguments .

  undecided after this point . 
  keeping options open . 
  no real opinion to be honest , not too much of a cinephile . 
  yes , they all share a foundation , but they can be quite different . 
  french is one of the more divergent ones if i remember . 
  strange . 
  oh , got no issue with that . 
  i was surprised by the fact that it identified me as hungarian or greek before getting it right . 
  amused , due to the historically odd situation between us and hungarians . 
  i can live without those tbh , do n't see it as too big of a deal . 
  in my case , it came out like this : our top three guesses for your english dialect : * 1 .

  romanian ... hungarian ? 
  really ? 
  i remember that a similar test has been posted around here , but ca n't really find it . 
  first time around , i remember getting a mixed accent . . somewhat similar to philadelphia and the south , with some marginal similarities to california . 
  i 'll see what i can find . 
  hmm .

  edit : i misheard him . 
  [ the ultimate sas . 
  he 's definitely a good guy . 
  he 's a former eu commissioner for agriculture and he was a pm for one year in 2016 when our government fell due to protests . 
  he led a technocratic interim government until elections took place . 
  he supports the fight against corruption , transparency , less bureaucracy , environment protection and has generally good and modern measures he wants to implement . 
  two romanian parties supported him as a pm in the parliamentary elections we had last year , but unfortunately , as it happens a lot , social democrats won . 
  initially he said he 'd creat an ngo , but now it looks like there 's a chance he might create his own political party which sounds great for some of us . 
  you know how people get @ schultz ? 
  we get like that @ ciolos . 
  unfortunately for us , that only happens on reddit and reddit is not quite representative . 
  which is why i used `` can have '' rather than `` must have '' . 
  i 'm no expert so i did n't want to say `` must have '' . 
  both simple murderers and terrorists can have some sort of mental illness if they can attack or kill in cold blood ( psychopathy can be one of them ) , but while an agenda ( political , religious , etc. ), 
  is n't a necessity for a murderer , agenda is pretty much mandatory for terrorists . 
  conclusion ? 
  both can definitely be mentally ill and not stating explicitly that a terrorist might be mentally ill means that they assume you can do the mental gymnastics . 
  mentally ill also does not mean you are not aware of your actions or that you should not support the consequences . 
  unless you 're a schizophrenic or something . 
  but glad tumblr 's with us tonight . 
  hope everyone makes it through !, 
  romania had paid all of its debt before communism fell . 
  were we rich enough to do it ? 
  did people have to live in disgusting conditions so the glorious leader could achieve that ? 
  yes . 
  and then came the neocommunists under the `` breakers of chains '' title , an even more disgusting bunch of fellows . 
  hey , look , another reason to hate russians . 
  gib weed sir . 
  indeed . 
  they just keep posting it . 
  nobody in the party agreed and it was rejected very quickly . 
  i do n't know where you 're from , but i can tell you about romania . 
  the social democrats were never really publicly anti eu because it was not a popular sentiment . 
  nowadays they keep making anti eu statements while their voters are being fed propaganda about the west at one of the most watched channels in romania . 
  this is one of the reason we made the human eu flag at our recent protests . 
  that 's not to say that these people suddenly become anti eu because a lot of them have a lot of ties within the eu , but it starts a sentiment and it 's obviously risky . 
  eu has grown unpopular in certain eastern countries , but in romania , among the people , eu is still quite popular . 
  problem is that we have corrupt politicians in power and for them eu represents an obstacle in changing laws so they can save their asses or stealing our money ( cause they know not to fuck too much with the eu funds which is why they barely take any ) . 
  if the eu leaves the integration process up to the current leading party ... 
  i ca n't say for sure that they wo n't be happy to fuck it all . 
  it 's a 50/50 chance and many of us see it as a risk we can not afford to take . 
  sure , it does n't , but people eventually get frustrated . 
  eastern europe does relay on nato a lot for defense , but eu is economical and political . 
  some will feel like pulling out . 
  i get supporters of these feel like `` oh , but you 'll be allowed to integrate more if you want to '' , but things are n't as simple as that at all . 
  if the eu plays this two tier eu wrong , some countries may back out because they 'll either get frustrated with the eu or they 'll feel like they 'll always lag back and that the eu does n't care anymore if you 're not in the inner circle and they will leave . 
  and what if they decide to vote on things that affect us , but wo n't let us vote because we 're not at a certain level ? 
  fuck that . 
  i guess we wo n't be very bothered by this since all the rich countries will be in the inner circle . 
  we celebrating by giving gifts . 
  girlfriends , wives , mothers and teachers especially receive them . 
  there 's also some free events like concerts and what not . 
  no , i 'm staying stop trying to ignore the bad . 
  who the fuck even cares about how good was hitler at painting ? 
  the man committed genocide . 
  he could have painted something on the level of mona lisa for all i care , he still remains a disgusting mass murderer . 
   quite a sad thing that recalling the past achievements slowly becomes taboo in modern days . 
  like what ? 
  the soviet union ? 
  the soviet union can kiss our asses . 
   you sound like a nazi apologists . 
  not defending op , but y' all sound like colonial genocide apologists here . 
  `` it was bad , but ... '' . 
  dude ... 
  where are the british dudes that told me the empire was n't popular anymore and that only 90 + year old people liked it ? 
  so the nazis were the heroes all along ? 
  my , my . 
  let 's stop acting as if russians have no choice . 
  many people have fought for liberty from tyrants . 
  sure , it wo n't be easy , but it is achievable . 
  off topic , but this reminded me of [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/oux-nfml0ii?t=23 ) . 
  they are a punishment . 
  of course they are . 
  no one pretended otherwise . 
  he 's going to have high approval either way . 
  might as well keep the sanctions . 
  someone pointed out to me that they could go ahead and make another eu . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5wxcyc/stop_bashing_the_eu_jeanclaude_juncker_tells/dedm4tx/ ) that they do n't necessarily need a vote on it or a change of treaties . 
   this wo n't happen . 
  france does n't even let us join schengen , do you think we will be accepted into an even more integrated group of countries ? 
  this . 
  those dudes up in the netherlands would rather scratch their eyes out than allow us into schengen even though we met the criteria and the ep voted in support for us ages ago . 
  finland and germany are opposed too . 
  did n't know about france though . 
  the moment an english person starts talking about independence i laugh . 
  absolutely hilarious . 
  independence . 
  that 's weird . 
  ca n't people do both ? 
  yeah , you have a point , but i do n't want them to take us into a position so bad , we wo n't be able to recover from it . 
  do funds matter that much for psd tho ? 
  it 's very hard to steal eu funds without eventually getting caught and they barely ever use them anyway . 
  i think that 's one of the reasons . 
  eu has asked us numerous times to use the goddamn funds . 
  sorry , i did n't know . 
  it 's just people sometimes forget that there were other people killed in the holocaust too . 
  more than 6 million actually . 
  almost 6 million were jews , but the nazis killed other people too : gypsies , slavs , pows , gays , etc. 
  is it now ? 
  i mean , why would this not be a sham and why would they not want to get further away from the eu ?

  and yet the idiot complains about solidarity  tsipras and varou 's behavior make more sense , if we assume that defaulting has been their plan from the start . 
  yep, 
  maybe we are the new eu champions at cooking the books then, 
   2 million romanian working abroad it 's 4 i think or are you counting just workers , not their kids etc that they brought with them ? 
   we need to make sure that whatever put greece in this position does n't happen again that 's mainly up to greeks themselves, 
  the guardian lieing ? 
  reddit wont like this, 
   after ww ii the country experienced hyperinflation , and it was very bad in '47 people just threw the money on the streets or used it for making fire kinda like in this polandball http://i.imgur.com/wapgpeo.png but in real life and your own money, 
  yeah democracy !, 
  think about the dignity and pride of them too !, 
  no humiliation !, 
  we 've had ~ 20-25 this week here . 
  it rained often, 
  is he still duma speaker or what he was ? 
  i wonder if we get monies too if we reunify, 
   so they will cover the development costs '' . 
  really ? 
   we even have legalized gay marriage . 
  you 're ahead of us there we just rejected it recently i think, 
  i see downvotes . 
  we do have putinists here you know . 
  cool now remember not to negotiate with terrorists and then let 's see where else you get financing from . 
  will money grow on greek olive trees ? 
  oh stiglitz said so and then greece was right to spend more money than it could afford to, 
  you should translate it ffs some examples : 25 % public sector wage cuts for pretty much everyone + cuts to bonuses and all kinds of rights pensions froze for 2 years attempt to cut them by 15 % was blocked by court and instead vat went up from 19 to 24 % ( we might go back to 19 next year btw ) unemployment and child support money cut by 15 % lower pension wealth limit so more people could be taxed by 5.5 % social security all in one move iirc in 2010 plus all kinds of other taxes , excises , privatisings , lay offs , lower social spending , the usual stuff . 
  we seem to have recovered better than many others . 
  tax collection going up and reforms continue , anticorruption going really well , growth ( 3.5 % in 2013 , 2.9 last year , ec expects 2.8 now and wb 3 % , t1 2015 gdp equaled t3 2008 for the first time ) , 6-7 % unemployment . 
  mind you we went through the same troika shit . 
  it 's terrorism by the definition to not give more free money ? 
  i think syriza wants to be as annoying as possible to get more of the ` foreign entities ' against them and then get their victim propaganda to be more effective, 
  lol corporate states you learn these words over in / r/conspiracy ? 
  obedient ? 
  more like responsible, 
  well , dijsellbloem yesterday evening confirmed that there have been no talks with greece at all and that there is no agreement existing whatsoever , which indicates thaf mr v is lying through his teeth . 
  yep varoufakis is just another populist deceitful politician same for tsipras the current government is n't so different from the older ones, 
   it is a matter of matching expenses to revenue . 
  so greeks are living beyond their means and they do n't want this to change greece just wants to keep denying reality, 
   she even told me that black people are perceived as cool and exotic in russia !, 
  like pretty much everywhere else, 
  so young middle class russians from a wealthy city ? 
  is that really representative ? 
  this shows very long term problems with greeks for the eu, 
  ez guys better check and check and check a billion times before we join, 
  putin 's, 
  is n't it a problem that 75 % take early retirement ? 
  and he 's gon na end up in jail, 
  yep, 
  that and a medal, 
   russian base no it 's a tourist center, 
  just curios how does that def minister stand on russia issues ? 
   i think tsipras is just getting desperate . 
  reports are coming in that the majority will vote yes to the referendum . 
  yeah this new story does n't make him look so confident, 
  putin would love this a real enemy to fight and gain more popularity, 
  hows the media playing this ? 
   troika-induced austerity plans have had worse effect than planned . 
  did greece follow all the reforms planned too ? 
  not just some cuts, 
  it 's possible i remember reading that some investors changed their minds about spending in orbanistan and instead look here because we 're , for now , more reliable, 
  lol it reminds me of stories with our oil we send sunflower to hungary and then we import their sunflower oil genius i know, 
  i 've heard sardinian is quite close to our language, 
   syriza is a bunch of idealists  ), 
   ponta and his crew are trying to give everyone a massive tax cut the weird thing is that they are likely to go into opposition soon and the dumbasses that will take power ( ` liberals ' ) will have to deal with collecting enough money to cover the tax cuts gap . 
  for them it would really suck to fail . 
  sometimes it happens here that a government makes some big budget changes not long before going into opposition and then let the other guys deal with it ( usually very badly ) while they gain the votes . 
  but in principle reforms are needed , the doubts are with them being sustainable which is what the ec questions and btw it asked for some sort of report on the effects of these changes which maybe we did n't do properly or even at all ( last finance minister who worked on it got arrested and the last one is dubious too so i have some doubts ) 2 elections next year, 
  yup and they may be right to do so, 
  they ca n't block it maybe i should have changed the title a bit, 
  iirc one of the reasons why leanca did n't get to be pm again was that he wanted a guy from here to lead that kind of agency there so there 's little political will for that kind of stuff, 
  wtf, 
  yep from day 1 i think syriza was actually interested in leaving and their only issue is how to get voters to be on the same page while pretending as much as possible that they want a prowestern solution, 
   if europe really wants moldova on their side , they should try to convince the pro-eu politicians to steal a bit less . 
  i do n't see how, 
  well the good part is that trust in religion is going down here so maybe we need patience, 
  apparently there 's a problem with referendums on fiscal matters and that constitution i think passed by popular vote , right ? 
  so is it constitutional or not ? 
  maybe russia will govern them then . 
  tsipras seems to like this eurasian union thing , most greeks like russia too . 
  i think we had this kind of stuff too in 4th grade or something, 
  that 's what the local media says i dunno what name the clinic has so i can search more, 
  pretty much daily there is a thread about this you obviously dont really follow this sub, 
  the dpr yes, 
  more like the lizard people thats why they call her queen lizzie, 
  i thought an official said they did n't yet do it http://uatoday.tv/politics/lithuania-undecided-whether-to-arm-ukraine-pm-butkevicius-443349.html, 
  thanks i really was n't sure if it 's bon or bien . 
  i went with what worked better in romanian :d, 
   the protests are n't necessarily anti-russian . 
  isnt the electricity firm russian owned ? 
  can you pastebin the text pls ? 
   `` everyone spies , is what spies do , duh ... '' but it 's bad only when the us spies because america is literally hitler or something when other allies spy on the us then it 's all fair game and nobody gives a damn, 
   worth mentioning that the european commission does n't give a damn about how much we spend on our military , what 's interested in is the overall budget deficit . 
  and it was our government that signed for us to keep that 1.4 % deficit . . back in 2011 iirc, 
  there was a story in our media about us not being able to raise that spending because of exceding iirc 1.5 % deficit http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/international/europe/2014/12/01/romania-to-seek-eu-imf-permission-to-boost-defense-budget/19762231/ the answer was no from the commission, 
  again new accounts for ttip fearmongering, 
  unless it gets blocked again in bruxelles because of deficit problems, 
  ee endured tsarist russia too and moscow still managed to impose itself again, 
  why are you posting a lying headline then ? 
  or you arent but you said ` always ', 
  `` opponents of the ukrainian government ` accuse ' ukrainian leaders of being jewish to try to discredit them . 
  plotnitsky 's wordplay implies a jewish conspiracy behind the anti-yanukovych revolution , and he then clearly states that jews benefited politically , '' adl national chairman abraham foxman told the post , referring to the ouster of ukrainian president viktor yanukovych in february 2014 .

  i find them to be the only bastion of real gonzo journalism left everyone else prepackages the news . 
  tell me the event and i can write the whole bbc , fox or cnn news story news is more a `` prefiltered '' reality show than reality . 
  and to acuse vice , that they use rawness as a selling point is to exempt other news outlets from doing the same thing but with stories interpreted in preexisting biases and fears . 
  at least with vice you can choose how you feel about it . 
  take this video , some see conspiracies , others anti russian propaganda , i , as a eastern european that knows how blatant corruption can be , feel nothing , however posting this i do feel disheartened of how wide the cultural gap is between idealistic western social justice warriors and eastern nihilism is , and i fear this will become more apparent as the economic gap closes up . 
  this is the kind of interpretation mainstream news does not allow , the emotional charge is already prepackaged , bagged and color coded , the only option for the viewer ( let 's be honest ) is either to assimilate it or reject it as biased . 
  no discussion , no grey zone . 
  again it falls under the lets circumvent the law ( because it 's diffult ) to give central autorities power , without the electorate knowing about it . 
  the law is bureaucratic hell because radical measures can be abused and beureacracy makes it difficult for this to happen . 
  why not due away with it , it is within they 're power , then the politicians would have to assume responsibility for their actions and not just argue against the bureaucratic mastodon ( from both sides ) . 
  also simplifying the bureaucratic process would also create milestones and make the ecb stick to a predetermined strategy , therefor making the whole process transparent and its architects stand by their actions . 
  also this measure basically asks of germans to acumulate debt for southerners , and beyond politeness i am sure that if the tables would be reversed , southern countries would n't agree to such a thing especially given the historical tensions . 
  the `` euro '' ( as in the economic and political status quo ) has been treated like an objective , all decisions where of self conservation by the system , and because the european `` government '' lacks powers , the eu gave de facto powers to the ecb to save the euro . 
  now those powers enabled measures that probably ( just a opinion ) saved the euro , but also affected sovereign debt and germans do n't like debt . 
  now the point can be made , that because germany is in the eurozone , `` we 're all in this together '' should be the predominant attitude but that would hurt national politics , and that is the de facto source of political power at this time , both for the eu and national governments . 
  so at this time we are heading toward a quite absurd cycle of local politicians opposing euro measures , european authorities circumventing unanimity and eu laws to be able to fix the issues , which raises even more euroskepticism and fuels even more the local politicians dissent . 
  my question is where is the line ? 
  how much authority does a semi autonomous eu institution get ? 
  why do we maintain the indirect system of voting for local politicians which in term make decisions that do n't sacrifice their political power or eligibility in the next election ? 
  and most importantly , has the euro zone become synonymous with the the countries that form it from a long term political and economic interest ? 
  i find it disheartening that a country can never exit the eurozone at this time and as a result the only sustainable option is to increase the power of the european cetral autority to make it work regardless of consequences , but without any political adjustments . 
  it is quite possible that in a decade or so we have an extremely powerful central authority that is unbounded by laws ( that it signs itself ) or local politicians ( that do n't have a consensus ) . 
  and completely out of touch with the wishes of its electorate . 
  the only catch up eco has made is because of subsidies , it more expensive as an investment , less efficient as a cost per mw and less reliable in the long term . 
  nuclear has payed of every single time , and the fossil subsidies is because we are a humane society that frowns upon poor people freezing to death . 
  no , you use what is more cost efficient and provides the most organic output , the `` all of the things '' attitude should be reserved to middle school term papers . 
  actually , no and a big one for that , most energy markets are interconected , you can literally buy everything you need if your productivity is insanely high . 
  you will never be able to produce green energy at the cost of algeria . 
  ( except nuclear ) . 
  but you have a tourist tradition , that will make you more attractive to foreign money than algeria at least for the foreseeable future . 
  now if you use that money wisely , not on populist and short minded projects or idealistic green socialist immature ambitions , and prop up a solid tech sector and service economy you will become a solid economy be the time algeria becomes more attractive to tourists . 
  it 's easy in hindsight to see the problems the euro brought to ireland but most of the growth came from easy capital that would n't have been as plentiful if tnot for the eurozone . 
  becoming a strong economy is dependent on state liquidity and a healthy macroeconomic environment , and large financial markets ( like london ) tends to atract both , so i would expect the independent scottish economy not to be really that stable ( at least at first witouth a sort of liquidity funnel from the ruk , but this would limit national autonomy and taxing oportunities ) . 
  but i do n't have the numbers , so it just a teory on my part . 
  both protectionism and the open door policy are viable . 
  only the future scottish chancellor can actually decide , we wo n't see the books only after they 're closed . 
  i do not know the numbers but i do have a grasp of how trade works . 
  the larger economy in general is more competitive , and simultaniously both profits and inhibits competitivity in the smaller economy . 
  as per this particular case , scottish companies compete with larger english companies , but in general do not sell as much in england as the english sell in scotland ( because of their size difference ) . 
  given a trade tax , scotish exporters and importers would suffer ( but now they can adapt to the eu market given that there is less of a financial difference to working with the uk ) , but they are but a few when compared with local producers , manufacturers and retailers that wo n't be forced to compete with already established english competitors . 
  and at the end of the fiscal year the government works on taxes , if there is no economic base to tax , you either reduce expense ( rarely happens ) , borrow ( at insane rates given you are a new economy ) or tax the people ( i guarantee the scottish electorate will hate that more than a trade tax ), 
  if ireland would n't have joined , it would have been dependent exclusively on the uk . 
  the tech or software development , construction boom all the explosive growth of the celtic tiger was a consequence of easy capital and business opportunities gain from eu . 
  popular opinion does n't realize how fragile a economy supported by a couple of million people is , within 3 years the necessity of a life raft will become apparent , only the rich can afford to be conservative ( euroskeptic in this case ) . 
  yes , and this would make scottish products more appealing , this in term rises scottish companies revenues , which allows them to grow , hire more people and pay more taxes ( beyond what the income the government would actually raise from taxing imports ), 
   it is likely that `` no '' will win the day in the referendum , so therefore the question will not even arise . 
  i know , but even the gesture can have resounding effects in 4 to 6 years . 
   it will definitely be in ruk 's interests for scotland to be in the eu . 
  except that if scotland is not in the eu she will still be politically and economically dependent on the uk most of your questions suppose that scotland is a special case , catalonia will be a special case as it is in the eurozone . 
  for practicality i think scotland will be treated as a seprate entity , and all the political steps respected , i think they will try to go for the euro as soon as posible . 
  i do not think they will exit out of shengen or the `` poundzone '' rather again for reasons of practicality , they will be on a theoretical `` trial '' period until the political bureaucracy comes to resyncs with reality . 
  small economy , after a political shock , it will be attacked by vultures trying to get a foothold before the political environment gets a grip on the situation . 
  i would try to protect my self from my neighbors . 
  at the end of the day , they are n't scottish companies that pay scottish laborers and scottish taxes . 
  we shall see how the waters settle after the referendum, 
   i know who my money is on to come out on top and because you invoked the bigger is better argument cultural issue = collective psychie, 
  to counter balance the anglocentrism or / r/europe, 
  what would they ever do , they 're going to regres to medieval ways in no time . 
  england is going to veto scotish admission anyway . 
   60 million versus 4 million people , i know who my money is on to come out on top . 
  me to , if we where in medieval times , cause you know might equals right  oh and `` empire '' really . 
  ffs yes , look at how unwelcome my satiric comment is , when it comes to imperialistic pride , the `` empire '' is still a realistic cultural issue with you guys, 
  yes there is , most heavy industry is dependent on robotics ( not the other way around ) in the eu , traditional factories are dramatically noncompetitive on the world scene , you are grabing on to an already old business model just for the sake of the `` old generation '' also 15 years of gradual change is significantly less damaging to the business environment than 5 years of drastic change in a inflationary global economy reliant on depleting carbon fuels . 
  best example post ww2 japan , it did n't take the western route of manufacturing and small business , it built for the future despite not having the natural resources and world comerce being quite expensive at that time , they chose to make high value goods made in humane factories , that where expensive at first but slowly their products became superior to traditional western factories and the +20 years experience advantage in managing resource imports prove the edge in the price wars for mid 20th century consumer products . 
  that sounds like a bluf . 
  somebody really needs to teach the british than nobody needs them , listen up you scots , this is what you do , step 1 you invent a new currency ( scotish crown crs ) , pegged to the euro/pound average , low monetary volume will make it vulnerable in the short term and pegging it will make monetary speculations more difficult , this will also support trade and eu ambitions step 2 , tax the empire , i assume most medium sized companies are local and foreign companies could hamper their growth potential step 3 , make a business friendly tax code , like ireland step 4 , enjoy british tears, 
  heavy industry is not the future , services tech and robotics is this measure is meant to force us to become the first large scale economy that is n't relaiand on opec it is a strategic measure meant for long term results i am no friend to the eco warriors but increasing renewable sources is the correct way to do this , not for the environment , but for the long term economic growth and autonomy . 
  edit : also the `` we need to beat the us '' is a immature war cry , we need to be ** better ** than the us and china , we do not sacrifice future development or human dignity for power and the pride of our leaders , i want the eu to remain faithful to its citizens and not compete in a rat race that does more harm to its citizens than benefits them . 
  no , just for abuses done by `` our '' politicians * our - as in born in the same geographical area , but in my opinion if someone does politics in bucharest he is a bucharestian politician and when he comes back he is a local poltician, 
   during the [ ** former pm 's ** ] ( http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/emil_boc ) * to be fair we had a former inteligece service oficial as pm between boc and ponta for about 3 months ( but he has just a political dick extension for basescu ), 
  just saying that if they where more polite , when the new administrative divisions would have been drawn a unified magyar region would have been a given and because of the precedence set by the comunists not even the nationalists would have complained . 
  from there like scotland and the basyue autonomy would have been a natural process . 
  no , my argument is that they used the situation for political gains and instead of breaching the gap , they made it wider intentionaly to pose as essential to the magyar electorate . 
  transylvania is finacially stable and more homogeneusly developed macroeconomically , from redistricting to autonomy is just a matter of time and a failed govemental budget . 
  there are whispers , they tend not to be loud because the confusion with the magyar movement is easy to make . 
  but let 's say transilvanians kinda hated all the money the socialists directed at moldova ( during the first 15 years after communism , it can be argued it needed the help , how much was diverted to private interests we will probably never know ) . 
  so there is a strong hatred toward bucharestian politics , over here . 
  during the former pm 's ( former and present mayor of cluj ) mandate he placed his people all trough the goverment ( a really incompetent goverment when dealing with the finacial crisis ) , redirected a lot of funds toward his local friends ( a lot of money ) and basically did nothing to oppose the presidents abuse of the media , the justice system , foreign policy , and intelligence services . 
  so it 's fair to say that transylvanian politics is not really looked upon with kind eyes since then by the rest of the country . 
  the pm 's case was a joke , it was a political coup de gras , a political fuck you to the former `` supreme ruler '' . 
  actually the communist started the policy , that is what `` autonomy '' meant for the soviets ( everywhere ) , you feed their national ego but literally starve them . 
  these idiots just neglected everything and the poorer parts of moldova valahia and hargita/kovaszna took it the hardest . 
  i think they deserve a decent life and a brighter future for the next generation . 
  and i do n't think , speaking as a economist that that can be attained trough autonomy , the do n't have the economic strength to prosper alone , yes it 's not there fault but the fact remains . 
  that is why a bigger autonomous region would be the best solution , as i said i 'd even give them to hungary , despite that being politically impossible . 
  no , stop arguing the natural resources card , we easterners should know better than that , you can literally have money grow on trees if the political climate is filled with short minded corrupt assholes , it is worthless , and the state of the corruption in that area is ridiculous . 
  nothing is a hassle for our politicians cause they don + t give a fuck , except for reelection they just do their own thing and let the rest of us live . 
  the attitude towards the subject of autonomy is poisoned . 
  because rmdsz used a lot of anti romanian rhetoric trough all these years . 
  so at the basic level above all else its just a ego thing , do n't let rmdsz win , despite the fact that objectively they would hate the most to lose . 
  but as i previously stated , i think your aproach of hungarians must rule hungarians no matter what , is the same ego trip just with different colors , your putting a principle in front of what is objectively better for the people , especial now , since there are no borders between budapest and miercurea-ciuc . 
  maybe your movement could take a more hands on approach to help your brethren , bypassing local coruption and rmdsz 's political games . 
  it bigger than the hungarian thing , we basically have 3 major parties but about 7 to 8 interest groups , so they decided that the honorable thing to do is to split up the country and stop the internal fighting . 
  fair enough , my opinion is that it is irrelevant anyway , because our current situation is a recent developent and nationalism is retarded . 
  a good example is the we can be represented only by others like us , in my brief brush with local politics i encountered this stupid etnic rational both from the romanians and the hungarians , it baffles me to this day , that you think `` one of your own '' , despite proving time and time again to be corrupt and incompetent , is still the only `` acceptable '' option . 
  and i have no qualm with hungary taking the whole region under its borders , i just do n't get why the fuck does it matter ? 
  sibiu is governed by the germans for about 15 years now and it 's progress is amazing , why does autonomy matter so much . 
  hungarians have learn to balme everything on bucharest , like local politicians are non-existent . 
  i think all eastern national patrimony where raped by the privatization fashion , and imf loans , blame the imf and the academic understanding of what makes a competitive economy for those . 
  also all eastern politicians took a cut if they where offered the opportunity .

  ( slide 3 ), 
   chechnya ( yes i knwo it 's not europe ) actually , [ it is ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/map_of_europe_%28political%29.png ) . 
  i do n't much dissagree with you actually . 
  i just think that this statistic is meant to show the willingness in post-89 romania more than anything . 
  sure , we can compare a century 's worth off data ( if we have it ) , but then all the data has to be put in it 's proper context . 
  not saying pre-89 is not important . 
   know how to read and a bit more about austria than : `` they 've got some really tasty ~ ~ kangaroos ~ ~ * swans * '' ftfy  it 's not voter turnout ... 
  it 's not but comparing pre-89 with post-89 means nothing , as pre-89 the state actively forced many roma to go to school . 
  the study is significant as it shows growth of highschool graduation post-89 . 
  it 's a bit `` apples and oranges '' to compare the rates in 2 different systems . 
  maybe to you . 
  but a lot of people still think that a significant proportion of roma are nomadic , as opposed to the general population . 
  given how they cite western european countries as the main source , i 'd tend to agree . 
  but i would n't be surprised if there some balkan muslims as well . 
  maybe even some from russia too ( caucasus ) . 
  i do n't really get offended by these things either , but a lot of my countrymen do , that 's why i mentioned it . 
  i remember that . 
  had a good laugh !, 
  interesting how eastern europe seems to have a smaller gap than western europe . 
   because ~ ~ we do n't give a fuck ~ ~ of ~ ~ all that famous tolerance ~ ~ marijuana . 
  * something , something * dracula !, 
  but that would be like comparing voter turnout when voting is mandatory to voter turnout 10 years later when voting is optional . 
   if that 's childish to you , oh well . 
  i meant the attitude that \u201e some decades of communism seem insignificant '' and that the division made sense only while the iron curtain was up . 
  divisions like the iron curtain leave [ long ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poland_a_and_b ) [ shadows ] ( http://www.dw.de/breaking-down-the-wall-in-the-head/a-1344803 ) . 
   i do n't feel western but central european as i said in a different comment , the two terms are not necessarily mutually exclusive . 
  `` eastern europe '' is just shorthand for post-commie europe . 
  i 'll leave [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/center_of_europe ) here, 
  romania as well . 
  central , eastern and south-eastern, 
  \u201e good evening budapest ! '', 
  well , it is close to russia . 
   torn down more than 20 years ago . 
  sure , the division made sense during the east-west split after wwii , but that 's the past . 
  and not a very long one , for that matter . 
  that 's not how it looks east of said curtain . 
  communism left a strong mark here . 
  it may not feel relevant to you , but it still is to a whole lot of people . 
  brushing it off like that seems a bit childish tbh . 
   it 's strange though to say austria is western european , whereas e.g. 
  czech republic or slovenia are eastern european , even more so considering both prague and ljubiljana are to the west of vienna . 
  not that strange when you take into account the iron curtain, 
  that 's because \u201e central europe '' is a cultural-geographic label ( mitteleuropa and all that ) while \u201e eastern europe '' has a geopolitical-historic dimention to it ( basically \u201e former communist europe '' ) rather than a strict geographic label . 
  a relic of the cold war when everything was about east vs. west . 
  they are not mutually exclusive . 
  dammit !, 
  [ from the frontpage thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1cxjw9/animalrights_activists_wreak_havoc_in_milan/ ) :  one of the comments on this article comes from one of the phd students working in that lab . 
  i have paraphrased what she says . 
   * `` what i really want to become clear is that we do think that animals have rights . 
  we do respect them , and treat them with as much precaution and attention as we can , often much more than what is legally required , in order to minimize their suffering and improve the quality of their lives . 
  we do try to use as less animals as is compatible with research aims and we work hard not to waste their lives . 
  finally , making this kind of attack does not help animals . 
  many of the stolen mice will die soon outside our facilities because they have a weaker immune system ( the ones that did n't die during the transport , since tens and tens of mice of both sexes were mixed up in boxes , and moreover as much animals will be needed to compensate their loss to make the reasearch go on .

  one man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter . 
  thank you for taking the time to write this . 
   th long term effects of this agreement , if ever put into action ( very questionable ) will most likely be a lot more negative than positive for the region . 
  could you expand on what the possible effects might be , both positive and negative ? 
  depends on the village . 
  berettyoszentmarton ( near ro/hu border ) does n't look depressing at all . 
  this reminds of how the bosnian serbs killed the vance-owen accord in bosnia , although everybody was for it , including milosevic . 
  well , it was n't erased by the mods , i can tell you that .

  same in romanian .

   f i go to a store in that `` yellow '' area over there in romania , and i ask in romanian to buy something , i 'll be turned down for not being hungarian . 
  no you wo n't  demanding that residents of a country should speak that country 's language is not nationalist bullshit !, 
  you were n't demanding anything . 
  you were being a nationalist asshole . 
  your first word in your first comment was an ethnic slur . 
   irelevant . 
   should i go ahead and assume that they speak serbian ? 
  or maybe armenian ? 
  you should go ahead and investigate . 
  i put every language down once , even if a language is n't a continuum . 
  that 's why i did ' t write the english word over ireland . 
  this is not a map about politics . 
   that particular yellow spot would have a reason to exist if it contained an actual word that is being used in that particular region . 
  it has a reason to exist because the area speaks another language . 
  the same reason other linguistic areas are shown in different countries . 
  sami areas , turkish areas in bulgaria , ossetian , karelian , kalmyk in russia , catalan , basque and galician in spain , welsh , and so on . 
   you just made that yellow spot there for not apparent reason i did n't `` make it '' , it was on the [ base map ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:simplified_languages_of_europe_map.svg ) and it was there for a reason . 
  this is not a map of official languages , but one of mother tongue . 
  the fact that some people get paranoid at the mere hint that there are hungarian speakers in romania is not my problem . 
  deal !,

  thank you for the translation .

  uuuu . 
  please find it . 
  that would be interesting !, 
   there 's nothing equivalent ( yet ) for the eu ; [ there is ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europeanism ) , but in its early stages i 'd say . 
  but you 're right . 
  what we need is a common narrative . 
  that 's why there is a white border between the irish ( gaelic ) areas and the english areas . 
  but each language gets mentioned only once .

they 're cheaper because we are poorer . 
  also they started to bury the cables and some places are looking better already . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnuxqu9j9da ) . 
  man i really love her voice . 
  in romania the cinemas have two versions of kids 's films . 
  a dubbed one and a subtitled one with original voice . 
  i remember watching how to train your dragon in english with subtitles ( not that i need subtitles ) . 
  we have that even in romania . 
  i used to watch nickleodeon ( i 'm a sucker for spongebob and avatar ) in english instead of watching it dubbed in romanian . 
  when i was a kid we had antenna tv and we received a moldovan tv station which did just that . 
  you can hear the original soundtrack only lower volume and the dub in russian/romanian is delayed by like a few seconds . 
  the delay is very similar to dubbed kung-fu movies in the us . 
  hey !, 
  romanians are not racist . 
  they just unconditionally hate gypsies . 
  but everyone knows that 's not racism . 
  one other thing that people here seem to not take into account is that a lot of the renting in romania is done illegally . 
  there is no contract , everything is done verbally . 
  this mean that the situation of rents is not really accurate . 
  most people do this because they can keep the rent low and they take all the money . 
  also a while back the government passed a law to add health contributions to rents which also encourage off the record renting because otherwise the rents would be bigger . 
  it 's not really a `` maintenance fee '' but actually an `` administration fee '' and most of it goes to heating anyways . 
  what 's left is used to pay the cold water , administration council of the building , the garbage collection , the janitor , the electricity for the hallway lights , a small fund for unexpected stuff and in some cases for gas ( i lived in a place where gas was included in my `` administration fee '' ) . 
  the ones you find in the city are great . 
  it 's the guys you find at the airport or at the train station which are the real assholes . 
  in those places always call a taxi from the city ( there are special machines which allow you to do that ) even if you have to wait a bit more . 
   there is even a law that a sign has to be erected next to things that were to some extent financed with eu money we have those in romania too . 
  that 's what happens in the darker part of romania too . 
  people get drunk and one of them remembers that the other guy owes him money , or looked weird at him 5 years ago or some other stupid shit like that . 
  the whole affair then ends up with someone 's head split with an axe . 
  well as long as they do n't make something like the monstrosities they make here . 
  here in romania they allowed graffiti artists to paint the older trains instead of repainting them . 
  those buildings are awesome . 
  i wish we had some like those here instead of these shitty and depressing communist buildings . 
  alcohol and poverty . 
  not all poor people are gypsies . 
  from the ones you posted only # 1 and the woman from # 5 seem to be gypsies . 
  the # 2 and # 3 kids are just poor . 
  they do n't look to be gypsies . 
  there are a lot of poor romanians too . 
  \\ # 4 seems to be a homeless older woman . 
  \\ # 5 only the woman seems to be gypsy . 
  \\ # 6 and # 7 are romanians . 
  they are not gypsies . 
  they look like the typical romanian meatheads . 
  you can find lots of them working as bodyguards or other jobs like that . 
  they also look your typical eastern european . 
  they are romanian . 
  well . 
  look at [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwerer_gustav ) . 
  it was one the biggest artillery pieces ever built . 
   over around 35 % of romania 's population lives in the country-side areas it 's actually around 45 % . 
  that 's tame . 
  in romanian we have : `` futu-ti mortii ma-tii '' which means : `` i fuck your mother 's dead relatives . '', 
   first you need to see that your icbms actually work you do realize that you can test icbms without nuclear payloads . 
  just put a dummy warhead or a conventional warhead on the missile and you can test it . 
  those rockets will work if they are launched . 
  the nuclear warheads will work as they are very straightforward . 
   i still do n't understand why people take that shit . 
  because they ca n't afford something better . 
  a person that has no drug problems will never take it . 
  but someone who is addicted and has no money and withdrawal is kicking in will take anything . 
  but you can put water from the tap in a bottle and then put it in the fridge . 
  it 's exactly the same in romanian . 
  this is not true . 
  like any culture we have our slobs but not all romanian men are unkempt savages . 
  this is eerily similar with what 's happening in romania . 
   there are also many bought gypsy votes . 
  this is possible thanks to how romani communities are organized . 
  they only need to pay one guy and they get hundred to thousands of votes . 
  and romanian movies are about communism , how poor we are , communism , drama , communism . 
  did i say communism ? 
  you mean ** reap ** . 
  nope . 
  i had a tree full of these too only that they were black . 
  almost every summer you could find me in that tree . 
  romanians historically were divided into many different states in the medieval period . 
  there were 3 main romanian entities . 
  moldavia ( the eastern part of the country ) , wallachia ( the southern one ) and transylvania ( the western one ) . 
  wallachia and moldavia were in the sphere of many different empires but they were mainly autonomous . 
  transylvania on the other hand did n't really exist as a autonomous entity but as apart of hungary and later the austro-hungarian empire . 
  because of this , a big goal of romanians and romanian leaders during history was to unite the countries into one . 
  this is was our national struggle until the xixth century when wallachia and moldavia were united into romania . 
  this union was very much opposed by the big powers surrounding the countries as it would weaken their power in the region . 
  later during wwi and wwii we also lost parts of the country due to decisions beyond our control . 
  this history has made the average romanian to be very skeptical when it comes to any split of the country . 
  the data on that list is pretty old . 
  for example romania has a 81 % turnout rate but today it 's under 50 % . 
  the data for romania is also skewed because from 1960 to 1989 we had a communist regime and we know how voting worked back then . 
   are people from outside the eu shipped in the eu or what ? 
  not necessarily . 
  for example there are all sorts of `` job offers '' in romania for young girls . 
  they say that they take them to germany ( just an example ) to work as housemaids or other menial jobs . 
  after they take them out of the country they force them into prostitution . 
  this is also easier as there is not thorough checks at the borders anymore . 
  the streets in italy , germany , spain are full of romanian girls forced into prostitution . 
  i 'm sure this exact thing happens in other countries too . 
  also the snow covers the garbage and keeps the dogs and homeless out of the streets . 
  well unfortunately the [ city planner ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicolae_ceau%c8%99escu ) is dead . 
  / r/rolistentothis / r/rocirclejerk / r/rocringe and for a nicer one / r/rogentlemanboners never and i mean never go to / r/rogonewild .

  you might as well burn the money or throw it into a pit . 
  what there needs to be , and what the americans are n't advocating , is a strategic set of goals and standards to meet no matter the spending required . 
  but that would mean a defence policy independent from the us . 
  the us really is only interested in selling more equipment to smaller countries without their own defence industries , that 's all . 
  is this really surprising coming from a `` bring the jobs back '' president ? 
   if germans had their own currency , it would be much stronger than euro , therefore they wouldnt be exporting so much . 
  you clearly were n't alive in the 80s . 
  but i ca n't really blame you , considering that people who were and should well remember how the mark was seen then are also peddling that sort of laughably amnesiac bit of folk wisdom . 
  edit : [ here , a summary of the german mark ] ( https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e5af/e08bcfb3dc6172a431fac4bf413b638e0f83.pdf ) tl ; dr : it 's not the currency . 
  wonder what their first piece of political theatre to show how ` opposed ' they are will be . 
  probably something to do with nato . 
  russia gets to keep the siege mentality , trump gets to rub europe 's face in how magnanimous he is , everyone walks away looking tough . 
  finally , took the better part of the decade , but the media has finally caught up to reality . 
  now let 's see how long until reality makes its way into the national capitals . 
  yeah , but the president of the council is less powerful than the president of the commission . 
  direct result of being the president of a room full of political divas . 
   brilliant thank you - giving a larger voice to smaller countries , and regions is one of the things i most like about the eu . 
  have n't i seen you post as a british eurosceptic ? 
  sort of makes the whole thing a backhanded complement , considering / r/ukpolitics is going on about how they 'll make trade deals quicker than the eu . 
   would n't this stop something like walloon blocking ceta happening again ? 
  no , thats a different mechanism . 
  the council represents national governments not national parliaments . 
  reason for the yellow card system . 
  i was there , and you 're talking self-serving non-sense . 
  all the other arguments orbited around the accession process . 
  the economy , borders , currency , trade . 
  at least all the arguments that were n't themselves made up self-serving non-sense . 
   why is it so popular in scotland ? 
  because alcoholism is the national sport . 
  you can always buy greek bonds , and help it out . 
  become the type of lender greece needs . 
  it removes the incentive for other asian countries to seek deals with china by giving them an alternative . 
  let me guess , as soon as ukraine joins the russian federation . 
  the demise of ttp in asia-oceania and the revival or mercosur-eu negotiations . 
  they are cousins and their actions effect all of us . 
  it 's part of playing on the same team . 
  fair enough . 
  although i suspect it was more so that the government is n't seen dealing with an expansive israel immediately before an election , rather than any intent on having an effect on israel . 
  i imagine they 're set to re-schedule after it 's over . 
   we will have to take more drastic measures to get the message across . 
  write a strongly worded letter ? 
  sorry , being snide . 
  but the eu as a whole and as components have no leverage in the levant anymore due to decades of neglect . 
  by and large , states attached themselves to the policies of others , like the usa . 
  not wearing discriminatory clothing does no more push your values on another , than being gay pushes my values on a fundamentalist christian . 
  what the fuck happened to progressive thought when we can excuse discrimination and repression with legalistic adherence and `` not pushing our values '' ? 
  we 're all literally becoming the nihilistic amoral mass that the fundamentalist loonies accuse us of being . 
  i 'm not a conservative . 
  i do n't focus on adhering to custom , but respecting choice , especially in a diplomatic capacity . 
  this is a situation where i 'm siding with people i normally disagree with . 
  i do n't like it , but apparently the government is getting flak from progressive members of parliament as well , so at least there 's that . 
   our values are n't better , they are different . 
  people have fought traditionalists generation after generation to get to where we are , and you surrender with a shrug . 
  the alt right march to the tune of `` respect of traditional values '' , and thank people like you for paving the way . 
  no they did n't reiterate what was already in the newspapers . 
  the sun published that lloyds was moving they hq from scotland , despite that it 's hq was already in london . 
  when talking to the treasury , the journalists raised the issue of rbs as well from an unknown source and the treasury confirmed it , despite the decision now being made , and the issue is that they were n't allowed to leak that information before they re-opened and an official statement released . 
  it was in effect a clear interferance in corporate decision making , and a release of market sensitive information outside of official channels . 
  that 's already breaching the letter of the law , if you trust the treasuries telling of events regarding the unknown source . 
  and even more damning if that 's the damage control version . 
  here 's more on it from the bbc : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-29185319 and some extra detail from the herald regarding the source of the leak : http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13205789.revealed__civil_servant_who_issued_rbs_leak_email_links_with_better_together_leader/, 
  developing the civil code and secularization happened in parallel . 
  as well as the development of countries , from what were once dynastic landholdings . 
  all , roughly by the same people . 
  and before that it was a canonical obligation in church and a sign of humility adopted through societal pressure everywhere else . 
  in other words , you 're comparing apples to oranges here . 
  it was stamped out before a legalistic approach could be taken to enforcing it . 
  it 's exactly because they represent a pluralistic , free democracy opposed to narrow mindedness that they should have maintained their official dress code of their office , which i imagine would not permit distinction to be made in regards to personal attributes . 
  you can call it inter-cultural competence . 
  and if they showed the same competence at the negotiating table , i imagine the iranians have only praise to give . 
  [ here 's the summary of it from the bbc ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwnkuibhw3i ) apparently the treasury can leak market sensitive information , as long as the journalists ask for it first . 
   name a single christian country that requires women to cover their head in public . 
  you have no idea how much work went into secularizing until that was the case . 
  the countries are n't so much `` christian '' anymore as a result , they 're just countries . 
  when dressing up like you would in your own office is cause for offence , and you have to dress like a romanian peasant girl simply to do business , you 're sort of scraping the bottom of the barrel of `` mutual respect '' . 
  the custom is to discriminate and humble a specific gender , starting with a headscarf . 
  this is n't new , it used to be a fairly universal tradition everywhere , and it stopped because we made it stop . 
  i appreciate your cultural sensitivity , but it did n't need to be done , it gains no one anything , except the iranian leadership have a few nice photos of their western partners accepting that is is normal , that this is fine . 
  by that logic we can be offended by asking our representatives to cover themselves . 
  the `` i 'm offended '' game has no winners . 
  the reason diplomatic immunity exists in the first place , is so that this sort of question never arises . 
  these people are n't civilian tourists out for a walk . 
  these are professional representatives arriving for talks . 
  they do n't play dress-up . 
  there 's softball , and then there 's putting on a costume to impress the local big men , which this is . 
  i 'm sure they found it endearing , but i 'd be surprised if that is n't about it . 
  gold stars all around . 
   commenting mainly to show my support , in a thread full of hate . 
  there is nothing wrong or hypocritical in feminists choosing to wear the hijab out of respect to local customs . 
  you do realize that the entire control mechanism for traditionalist religious norms is demanding respect for local customs ? 
  it normalizes discriminatory patterns of behavior , so women choose , genuinely and freely to fall into line and not stand out despite empowering the larger system which limited them . 
  we fought the conservatives in europe for half a millennium over this sort of thing . 
   it is part of doing their job to act respectfully - often painfully so - to the country they are operating in , in order to be able to convey the messages they are there to convey . 
  which is apparently `` we 're here to do businesses , and have no scruples . '', 
  we ca n't ignore that europe has an international brand . 
  and branding matters . 
  all this is doing is watering that down to the point we ca n't actually pretend we 're anything else but what the abrahamic fundamentalists accuse us of . 
  amoral , greedy , and opportunistic , with no substance and no spine . 
  do n't tell me what i 'm ok with or not , ok ? 
  and diplomatic envoys are not equivalent to whatever non-sense you 're on about .

  a bit like russian minorities , i suppose . 
  as a liberal secular humanist , i hate this guy more and more with each passing day . 
  how can hungarians stand for this bullshit ? 
  it seems so fucking crazy to me . 
  loved it !, 
  thank you for the post !, 
  what 's up with bulgaria ? 
  is it because they 've been getting ( like us ) so much bad press that they do n't feel accepted so , in tern , do n't feel eu citizens anymore ? 
   with virtually no exception comments will spring up that are either downright anti-serbian , or at best frame serbians as caricatures that 's not true at all !, 
  i 've always tried to defend serbia and to point out that things were n't black and white . 
  things were grey throughout yugoslavia . 
  and even though i admit i usually get downvotes when i 'm expressing my opinion regarding this issue , i was never the only one to defend serbia . 
  also , you must understand that the winners are the ones who write history . 
  they must antagonize and even demonize the entity they are fighting against in order to legitimize their actions . 
  an unfortunate consequence of demonizing a country for their mistakes and not taking into account their own suffering and the crimes committed against them is [ jingoism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jingoism ) . 
  this form of nationalism is caused by the frustration and the anger felt by the citizens of the respective country . 
  i , personally , can empathize with that frustration , but there are people who can not . 
  and to be fair , most serbs are nationalistic and feel they have been punished even though they suffered as well . 
  serbs need to forget about the wrongdoings against them and accept the history the winners wrote for them if they want people to accept them . 
  basically , do what the germans did even if you do n't think it 's fair . 
  it is the only way , in my opinion . 
  the countryside is not that great . 
  it 's a mere shadow of romanian villages of old where dance , culture and the love for nature prevailed in the past . 
  in transylvania , however , there are a few of those villages that maintained their culture and their beauty . 
  unfortunately , they are very rare . 
  so if the wine inside those bottles is `` dead '' and you pay 25,000 euros for it 's history - it 's dust - rather than the vine , that reporter scraped off what . . ? 
  4000 euros of dust ... ? 
  thanks !, 
  if you ever want to visit again , you are always welcome !, 
   also , next time you visit , forget about bucharest . 
  there are lots of other cities here that are way nicer than bucharest ( in my opinion ) . 
  and while you might not find stray dogs or chaos in traffic in these other cities , communist apartment blocks are omnipresent throughout the country . 
  unfortunately , you ca n't escape those . 
  i was only joking , mate . 
  and even though you are right and there are some roma with pale skin , they are very rare , certainly not `` many , many '' and they usually are half-roma . 
  they are not darker because they stay in the sun longer , they are darker because they were born that way . 
  for example , i have a gypsy friend which was born into a decent-earning family . 
  he has a good education and now has a good job , however , he is one of the darkest gypsies i 've met . 
  the people did n't kill him . 
  the higher-up in the party did . 
  they were probably feeling that if they continue to stand with him they will lose power , or worst , end up in jail . 
  there was a trial in which ceausescu was sentenced to death , but from later declarations , it seems that it was all set-up . 
  basically , romania had the same communist leaders in the '90s as we had before the revolution . 
  the difference being that there were new laws and there was no `` all-mighty god ceausescu '' . 
  that 's why we did so poorly in the '90s . 
  so yeah , the people did n't have the slightest clue what was going on , mate . 
  also , please step down from your high-horse . 
  i can see why joining the eu might be unpopular at the moment . 
  however , has there ever been a time when people in norway wanted to join the eu ? 
  probably not , but you are certainly a rare fellow . 
  thank you for the video . 
  that testimony confirmed what i already knew . 
  however , i ca n't help feeling even angrier and more frustrated than before . 
  i 've said it before and i 'll say it again - i regret each and every second my country was under that damned regime . 
   later in life i came to the conclusion that even the worst dictatorship is a democracy of non-revolution , as ceausescu was killed in the most primitive and brutal way . 
  i do n't really understand what you 're getting at here . 
  however , even though i am firmly against capital punishment , you have to understand that ceausescu hurt and killed lots and lots of people . 
  again , i 'm not really sure he deserved to die the way he did , but there is one thing i 'm certain of - if anyone ever deserved to die , it was him . 
  also , being shot in the head might be quite messy , however , i would prefer it over hanging ( saddam hussein ) . 
   because if you meet a gypsy that 's integrated in society you wo n't even know that he is one unless he tells you . 
  umm . . 
  i get what you 're saying , but does n't the indian/pakistani look give away the fact that he is roma ? 
  fair enough . 
  the reason i got quite annoyed is because i thought you were one of those ignorant fools who talk out of their ass . 
  thank you for your reply !, 
  i am aware of all the negative stereotypes and all the bad consequences that derived from romania 's accession to the eu ( gypsies running amok all over europe ) . 
  however , why do you dislike romania ? 
  have we been bombing and killing palestinians and i have n't heard of it yet ? 
  are we financing terror groups ? 
  are we trying to annex slovakia ? 
  do we smell ? 
  wtf ? 
  saying that we should have not been accepted in the eu is ok with me as it would be a valid opinion . 
  saying that you simply dislike romania is not . 
  for what reason ? 
  we 've made lots of progress since we joined and that trend seems to be continuing . 
  favorites ... ? 
  well , austria and switzerland spring to mind . 
  however , i quite admire and envy the scandinavians as well . 
  very interesting . 
  thanks a bunch !, 
  it is crazy to think that countries like slovakia surpassed countries like greece and portugal . 
  of course , greece was no luxembourg , but still , 10 years ago slovakia was quite shit and greece was quite great . 
  times have changed , but my perception refuses to do so . 
  it 's in ukrainian , so i do n't understand anything . 
  luckily , i scrolled down to the comments and found this : i 'm a soldier i have n't slept in five years and i have dark circles under my eyes have n't seen them myself but so i 've been told i 'm a soldier and i have no head ( * ) they have beated it off with their boots yo-o-o , commander shouts commander 's mouth is teared open because a grenade ... white cotton wool red cotton wo n't heal a soldier i 'm a soldier unborn child of war i 'm a soldier mom , take care of my wounds i 'm a soldier soldier of a country forgotten by god i 'm a hero tell me of which novel oh . . oooh . . 
  i 'm a soldier it vexes me when i have only one bullet left it 's either me or him the last wagon moonshine there are millions of us in the un i 'm a soldier and i know my job my job is to shoot so that the bullet does n't miss the ennemy 's body this reggae is for you mother-war are you happy now ? 
  i 'm a soldier i 'm a soldier unborn child of war i 'm a soldier mom , take care of my wounds i 'm a soldier soldier of a country forgotten by god i 'm a hero tell me of which novel ( in english ) i 'm a sol-dier i 'm a sol-dier i 'm a sol-dier i 'm a sol-dier i 'm a sol-dier sol-dier sol-dier-dja i 'm a soldier unborn child of war i 'm a soldier mom , take care of my wounds i 'm a soldier soldier of a country forgotten by god i 'm a hero tell me of which novel, 
  of course , however , this is still progress . 
  with romania free of russian reliance , europe is one extremely tiny step closer as well . 
  as far as i know , local production always means cheaper gas ( at least when compared to the russian prices ) . 
  there are indeed a few countries ( like germany and italy ) that pay very little for a cubic meter of gas , but the rest of europe ( central/eastern especially ) buy extremely expensive gas as there is virtually no other alternative and the russians pretty much have the monopoly . 
  sure - http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2bncwc/europes_most_hated_vice_news/ only 3 comments sadly . 
  indeed , but that 's not the actual reason . 
  the name comes from bulgarian , as dobrogea was theirs for a long time . 
   the town 's name is derived from the slavic ( more precisely bulgarian ) \u010derna voda ( \u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430 in cyrillic ) , meaning `` black water '' . 
  this name is regarded by some scholars as a calque of the earlier thracian name ax\u00edopa , from ie * n.ksei `` dark '' and up\u0101 `` water '' ( cf. 
  avestan ax\u0161a\u0113na `` dark '' and lithuanian \u00f9p\u0117 `` river , creek '' ) . 
  dobrogea ( the region in which this town is located ) has been under bulgarian control for a long time . 
  the town was actually founded by ancient greeks as a trading post with the dacians in the 4th century bc .

  it is more expensive than home , but less so than i expected . 
  thinking about all the cities i know , daily spendings are decent if you 're willing too search a bit , it is housing that is outrageous almost everywhere . 
  compared to bucharest : * supermarkets - 2-4 time more expensive and limited choice , over 4x with the \u201e fancy '' imported food ( decent prosciutto or moulded cheese ) and fruits * public transportation - a bit more expensive , incomparably better * restaurants - this was puzzling : it was generally some 2-3 x the price in romania , but near the sentosa train those seafood mini restaurants had unbelievably good food for 9-15 sgd , i 'd say cheaper than here for the quality * did n't touch alcohol in singapore because of the price : back here a beer is ~ 0.3 - 1.2 sgd in supermarkets , 1-3 sgd in restaurants and bars, 
  if there 's any crap record to outdo , we 'll take the task . 
  i think i get what you did here . 
  the concept i was looking for is ad hominem , and the parent was using it in a less direct way . 
  have an upvote , cunning sir . 
  funny how when a party criticises another party , the criticised party remembers the faults of the criticising party , and uses them in a vague sort of argument . 
  ~ ~ funny how when a party criticises another party , the criticised party remembers the faults of the criticising party , and uses them in a vague sort of argument . ~ ~ how the hell did i reply to a deleted comment ? 
  thanks a lot for this answer . 
  it brings some sense into this discussion and understand i 've missed some points . 
  i 'm not familiar with the subject and it 's the first time i 've heard about this in europe . 
  probably only some sorts of scarves would fit under a motorcycle helmet ( or driven by demand , helmet producers come with some innovations ) . 
  from all that i tried , 3m 8825 where the most comfortable and easiest to seal , but their price is quite high too . 
  also , from the marketing materials , the best seems to be bls zer0 31 c ( http://blsgroup.it/disposable/zero-series.html ) , but i could n't get my hands on it yet . 
  about my respro , i had the city , which is likely the worst . 
  do n't want to sound like a dipshit that has seen too many movies , but this seems like the sort of problem the state can easily solve with some undercover persons and hidden cameras . 
  it 's not like solving education , inequality or sending people to mars . 
  i also do n't get your irony with `` establishment approved source '' , you could expand if you want . 
  edit : typos, 
  had respro , do n't recommend it : uncomfortable and tends to seal improperly . 
  now i only wear industrial stuff ( ffp2 , ffp3 stuff , which are actual standards ) , which are also ** much ** cheaper . 
  this guy says the same : http://www.myhealthbeijing.com/china-public-health/respro-vs-totobobo-which-mask-works-better-for-air-pollution/, 
  / r/nottheonion , legit website : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/itv.com how can there be no conviction with 8000 + cases ? 
  i 've heard about this crap before , but i somehow believed it was a diminishing problem only present in a couple of african countries . 
  we deactivated them measurements stations in bucharest . 
  there 's no pollution if you ca n't measure it !!!, 
  now i regularly wear a filtering half mask ^ ( 1 ) when i 'm with the car or bicycle . 
  do you guys wear filters ? 
  because i see a business opportunity : i 'll setup a plant producing these things and sell the all over south-eastern europe . 
  ( 1 ) diesel soot is extremely small ( 2.5 micrometer ) , so these masks actually seem to filter at most 90 % : https://academic.oup.com/annweh/article/57/3/360/231096/penetration-of-diesel-exhaust-particles-through edit : reddit formating, 
   because , like any self-respecting citizen , nobody knows more than the first stanza this . 
  i hate our lame anthem , but not being able to properly sing 12-16 lines is a whole other thing . 
  was free trade a relevant subject of brexit ? 
  is n't it a ( possible ) side effect most leave voters did n't even think about ?!, 
  it 's an honest question , i 'm not trying to make any argument . 
  source please . 
  and have a tendency to grow complacent . 
  bet 10 euros that in at most 2 years i 'll be in the street for a similar abuse of power ( and we 're not even done with the current one , i 'll keep going until the decision is published in the official journal ) . 
  jesus fucking christ , this is a thing : http://www.transportenvironment.org/press/governments-double-and-delay-air-pollution-limits-diesel-cars , http://www.airqualitynews.com/2015/10/28/eu-car-emissions-test-proposals-a-disgraceful-stitch-up/ i had no idea about this although i 'm one of those that sometimes wear particle filtering face masks . 
  i just kind of lost trust that * this * kind of institution is able to help romania with the current situation . 
  i intentionally forgot to mention that this `` better healthcare '' only applies to the western half of europe + greece . 
  the other half has the same proportions of diesel cars , only they 're a lot older and pass the emissions tests with bribes . 
  come to r/europe with us flag and point out our retarded habit of running soot generators in the city -  get downvotes . 
  i recommend that next time you point our cultural diversity , or the better healthcare ; or just anything good about eu :d, 
  damn . 
  for two days i have refrained from criticising the castle/cattle trend by saying the word kettle : \u201e do n't give the ideas !, 
  do n't give them ideas ! '' . 
  and it happened anyway . 
  a this moment about 13 of 25 top subjects on r/europe are cattle or castle . 
  could we have 2 sticky threads on these subjects and leave more space for other stuff ? 
  in good british humour , please make some absurd petition to `` ban all humans coloured orange and called donald trump from entering uk '' . 
  the undo the brexit vote , because i remembered about the david blaine episode and want you to remain in eu even more : http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/19/newsid_3700000/3700652.stm `` but others have taunted him relentlessly , even sending a burger up to the box on a remote-controlled helicopter . '', 
  while i 'm not interested enough to watch a full documentary , i 'll outline note some interesting stuff from the article : - online pornography websites ( `` tubes '' and `` cam girl '' ) call themselves `` technology companies '' . 
  that is , just like uber , google , facebook , they do n't actually generate the products/content , but take a huge share of the revenues . 
  - visiting porn sites is so ubiquitous that london transport authorities had to warn that they 'll report watchers to the police - children in france see their first porn film at age of 11 - porn actors make a lot less because of porn websites - cam girl are `` the new proletariat of sex '' , work a lot on it , and get around 15 % of the money, 
  to what benefit ? 
  uk is not yet out , and they do n't stand to gain much from eu having troubles . 
  conversely , stirring the wrath of france and germany would be bad for negotiations . 
  the right thing indeed , as this appears to be a quite simple ( and correct ) ruling : \u201e the possibility of their rights being violated or reduced regardless of the degree of guilt or the gravity of the crimes they are accused of does not allow the implementation of extradition rules '' . 
  so the turkish government wo n't be able to spin that in any way except \u201e bla bla terrorism , bla bla terrorism '' : `` once again greece , an ally and a neighbour , has failed to fulfill the basics of the fight against terrorism [ ... ] the impact of this decision thought to be made with political motives on our mutual ties , our cooperation in the fight against terrorism and our work on other mutual and regional issues will be subject to a comprehensive review .

  a city with 750,000 visitors per year for a population of 330000 . 
  will come this year to visit and put an end to my ignorance ( this is the first time i hear about this city in europe ) . 
  maybe i 'm a moron , but could n't eu invest heavily in greece , and have the commission send a brigade to check everything the government spends for 5 years ? 
  how much of a sovereignty scandal would that trigger ? 
  and i mean giving serious billions , not just another debt cut . 
  i believe it 's clear that the government is not up to dealing with such a bad situation . 
   greeks sent tens of billions abroad following the syriza win , plunging the country into two more years of recession . 
  what is this about ? 
  people moving money in tax-heavens or something else ? 
  oh , i knew about the order and justice party , they make it to top of r/europe from time to time . 
  i had no idea they used bicycles to demean something .

  translation from https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/5oicii/this_is_so_dutch_it_hurts_a_police_officer/dcjh7dy/ \u201e police is looking for a cyclist in rotterdam who gave an officer a ride during the chase of a suspect . 
  thanks to the mean sprint the cyclist had in his legs the suspect was apprehended . 
  it was a funny sight , an eyewitness tells us : a guy running away , a cyclist who goes after him , and a police offer who is chasing them on foot . 
  until a second cyclist joins the chase and yells ` jump on the back ! ' . 
  the officer does n't hesitate and jumps on . 
  a little while later they catch up to the suspect on rembrandtstraat .

  the article is in turkish and i was busy when they went into breaking news on digi24 so i 'm not sure who 's responsible . 
  if this is the first piece to a wwiii domino i 'm gon na find that gunman and punch him in the throat no , but seriously ... i hope things do n't escalate and they cooperate, 
  and i suppose this will bring back tensions right ? 
  unless it 's proven he was just a psycho edit : apparently reuters says he 's dead . 
  oh god , here we go, 
  stop showing off your damn liberal laws we 're jealous :(, 
  maybe he should stop causing tensions himself  but i do agree that 2017 will probably be just as fucked up as 2016, 
  let us have this one thing for once goddamn it, 
  when are you gon na post the results ? 
  i thought so too because of :  i currently live in a czech republic, 
  i 'm sorry but this sounds immature if you ask me . 
   they just scream in their language and are useless . 
  what 's wrong with them using their own language ? 
   west eu kids or mature people , they try to talk in english that does n't make them special or anything . 
  it 's a shield ffs, 
  me too , me too . 
  this reply right here is the result of a isolationist propaganda . 
  first of all , we do not live with the crumbs germany throws at us . 
  we 've voluntarily made the decision to enter a union of countries that generally have the same interests , principles and goals . 
  every country gives and receives from the eu . 
  it 's how a union works . 
   we will always stand up for our national interests and continue our own unique path . 
  it 's pretty sad you say that with pride knowing that your country is constantly looking for opportunities to create chaos in other countries . 
  keep up the good work , comrade !, 
   the economy is far from collapse and is projected to start to grow next year . 
  we 'll live and we 'll see . 
  you keep annexing territories and we might just isolate you completely . 
  i do n't know about other european countries , but we do not rely on russia at all . 
  not even for gas . 
  you 're so blind , you ca n't even see that your own government is actively taking actions that hurt your economy , your credibility , your image ... everything . 
  i wo n't even mention the suffering it brought upon its neighbour country . 
   i am not jealous to say the least . 
  [ you 've been brainwashed . 
  of course you 're not . 
  ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/xt77xgggwsmn9ummkk/giphy.gif )  and if that means bad relations with some far away empire in the west why are these relations getting bad ? 
  because you have an aggressive foreign policy . 
   who cares ? 
  right ... who cares about pesky little things like other countries ' borders and human lives . 
   you care nothing about human rights , russia has no place to speak about human rights . 
  your state ca n't even properly grasp the concept of human rights . 
   you are weak vassal states whose only purpose is to erect the laws your masters tell you to erect . 
  you do n't know the first thing about the countries your country used to butcher up until the 90s . 
  and you do n't know anything about the concept of being united for a better future . 
  the eu may not be perfect , but at least we 're trying to work for a better future and not waging war on our neighbours . 
  it 's relative though : he 's literally fucking up his country 's economy with his actions just because he can . 
  i 'm not saying he 's not a clever person , but who 's interest is he following ? 
  is it the russians ' interest or his own ? 
  what is he exactly trying to achieve with his actions if not some cold war sphere of influence of sorts and a cold war tension ? 
  i think russians and putin have a hard time living with the idea that they 're not as big and strong as the soviet union was . 
  this is not from timisoara though . 
  it 's from bucharest . 
  nato would never attack russia . 
  there is no scenario in which nato would gain anything from a nuclear war with russia . 
  logically , russia does n't have anything to gain either , but the difference is that russia is controlled by a power hungry unpredictable maniac who has already attacked another country recently . 
  you 're being too dramatic about psd . 
  they wo n't sell us to the russians . 
  calm down . 
  i already explained why they would n't do that . 
  russian overlords are not like eu or american overlords . 
  they would n't lead happy lives at all . 
  well , you better prepare to fight in a resistance movement then . 
  / s i 'm sure trump does n't run the country alone . 
  there are decisions that he can not take by himself . 
   heck , the idiot would be capable of using eastern europe as a bargaining chip to get american companies some good contracts in russia or some other stupid bullshit . 
  do you think he 's stupid enough to think it 's worth losing influence in more than five countries to open a market in a country where the profits , i imagine , would be way lower than what eu has to offer ? 
  and more than that , do you think trump or those around him want a stronger russia ? 
  sounds unlikely to me . 
  what would the west say ? 
  russia would be right on their doorstep . 
  then again , i also think that even if this ludicrous thing would happen , russia would have a very , very hard time controlling these territories . 
  if they 'd be able to at all . 
  for your own safety , i 'm gon na assume you meant * roma , italia * . 
  that 's pretty clear . 
  if a nato country is invaded and other countries do n't do anything , that would be the end of it because there would be no point in it . 
  and i , for one , would like if our country responded the call regardless of what percent the country invaded spends on defense . 
  maybe we wo n't be of much help , but this kind of solidarity is what nato was built for . 
  mainly is about securing support from other countries who have made comments about not supporting countries which do n't pay their share . 
  that money would also help our military , i 'm sure . 
  maybe not enough , but it 's good to have it nevertheless . 
  yes , you 're very right about the nato spending and how important it is , not just to the members themselves , but to how nato is viewed . 
  however , i feel like western nations who are not yet spending their 2 % ( spain , germany , italy , belgium , the netherlands , etc. ), 
  do n't increse the spending because they do n't think russia or other countries present any threat to them . 
  many times on / r/europe i 've seen people from these countries saying that they do n't understand why they have to use the money on nato spending if no one 's threatening them and that this is just a problem the east has . 
  i find this disheartening to be honest . 
  yes , of course , i agree . 
  but hypothetically speaking , it would suck if russia would declare war on us today and nato would be like `` not at 2 % yet ? 
  haha , sucks to be you romania !, 
  cheers , * comrade * . 
   '' then again , we are a strategic country that the us is quite interested into ( which is partially reassuring ) , has soldiers and equipment here so i 'm not very sure how that situation would actually turn out . 
  i 'm just happy the party that won the recent election seems to agree that this should be done . 
  i 'm also happy that we can finally step out of the uncertain `` if you do n't spend x you wo n't get any back up '' zone . 
   i wish the world could agree to decrease the budget of military in every country and not the opposite ... well , as a french person i imagine you do n't have many worries over trump or russia . 
  romania and the east do have some worries . 
  while trump seems to have chilled down somewhat , russia is still a threat . 
  better safe than sorry mon ami, 
  we know that formally you 're actually called `` republica ceh\u0103 '' but we usually just call you `` cehia '', 
  i 'm sure they will be fine . 
  and anyway , so far , it 's europeans who have been attacked and whatnot . 
  they have more reasons to be scared of the future . 
  i knew it should have replied with the lyrics in glorious latin,

  i do n't know why this happens . 
  actually , plenty of people from transylvania have a mixed ancestry , my girlfriend included . 
  i see your point , but their languages ( cuman and crimean tatar ) were almost the same . 
  the differences were less than what are called `` dialects '' in most languages . 
  edit : i see wikipedia even claims that one of the dialects of [ crimean tatar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_tatar_language ) `` is a direct descendant of the cuman language '' . 
  some random tidbits about the romanian history : * romanians speak a curious language which is derived from latin , but it has many slavic loanwords and an albanic substratum . 
  * the grammar is very similar to albanian and bulgarian/macedonian , while also sharing some features with greek and serbo-croatian * romania was founded by the union of wallachia and moldavia in 1859 and transylvania was added after wwi * transylvania ( northeastern romania ) was conquered by the hungarians , but at least since the great mongol invasion ( 1241 ) , romanians have been the majority . 
  * wallachia ( southern romania ) was founded by a cuman ( who are some kind of tatars ) dynasty in 14th century , initially being a vassal of hungary * moldavia ( eastern romania ) was founded by a romanian warlord ( knyaz ) of maramure\u0219 ( north of transylvania ) , initially being a vassal of hungary, 
  not clever , but `` cunning '' . 
  that 's what the apparent etymology of his name means . 
   those are the yields for a 10 yr greek bond on the open market exactly . 
  if greece wants to sell bonds on the open market , they need to give the interest rate that the market wants . 
  before the eu/imf intervention , the only place to get money for greece was the open market , so they did pay this interest rate . 
  it went down after the eu intervention , now it 's just 10 % . 
  [ it was 20 % a year ago ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/gggb10yr:ind ) . 
  yes , if you buy 10-year greek bonds , you will get a 10 % interest rate , just hope they do n't get bankrupt by then . 
   when the crisis hit , greece 's debt started growing at a much higher rate than italy 's . 
  most of greece 's new debt after the crisis struck was due to high interest rate ( as high as 60 % ) for the existing debt . 
  greece need to borrow more just to pay the interest for the existing debt . 
  if the ecb would have intervened , there would have been no such interest rate and as such , little new debt . 
   lived on borrowed and eu money sorry to be so blunt , but you 're repeating propaganda . 
  before the crisis , greece 's debt levels have been more or less constant ( as percentage of gdp ) throughout the last two decades : * 1996 : 99.4 % * 2000 : 103 % * 2005 : 100 % -- * 2007 : 107 % * 2008 : 113 % * 2009 : 129 % * 2010 : 148 % * 2011 : 170 % up until 2007 , greece had a lower debt percentage of gdp than italy . 
  italy was saved by the ecb , greece was not , because it 's not `` too big to fail '' . 
   but in 2019 they will have a productivity that rivals the dutch ? 
  how ? 
  the greeks never had the living standards of the dutch , so they 're not asking for that . 
  so far everything was surprisingly calm . 
  no violence involving the riot police , no destruction of property . 
  it 's not the same scale : those were a dozen conspiracy theorists . 
  these are tens of thousands people . 
  you may not be able to be in the eurozone , to affect the decisions taken in there . 
  actually , that does n't really matter , as you 're going to be a small country and still germany and france will decide everything . 
  however , you can still use physically the euro unilaterally , like montenegro and kosovo . 
  indeed . 
  and i 'm making a link to that subreddit just to get some karma : / r/askhistorians, 
  a small historical tidbit : for a long time ( until 2009 ) , liechtenstein did n't recognize either the czech republic or slovakia because after wwii , the czechoslovaks confiscated the lichtenstein ruling dynasty 's huge domains in the country ( about 1,600 km \u00b2 , ten times more than lichtenstein 's area ) . 
  the czech and slovaks refused to return them because of the collaboration between liechtenstein and the nazis during the german occupation of czechoslovakia during wwii . 
  typically , that 's done by using [ bear-proof rubbish bins ] ( http://www.bearicuda.com/critter-can/bear_proof_garbage.php ) . 
  actually , the city of bra\u0219ov ( which has a bear problem , as they come down into the city in order to eat from the rubbish bins ) has very few stray dogs . 
  i 'm not sure if this is related . 
   when appropriating a neighbour 's history and culture [ ... ] how `` alexander is our history '' so you think you 've got some kind of a copyright on the region 's history ? 
  it 's their history , too , as the republic of macedonia is within the borders of the historical region of macedonia . 
   your country is populated by slavic races that had absolutely nothing to do with ancient greece do you think that there is such a thing as a slavic race ? 
  that 's the 19th century racial theory and it has been proven false by modern genetics . 
  people who live side-by-side share their genes : the difference between a greek macedonian and a slavic macedonian is just the language they speak . 
  northern greeks have some slavic ancestry and slavic macedonians have ancient greek genes . 
  no , because moldovans speak the same language with us , so we do n't consider them as not being real moldavians . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's a superiority complex or an inferiority complex . 
  probably a bit of both . 
   i was involved almost several years ago in the great macedonian war on english wikipedia , trying to get some sanity in there . 
  the greek wikipedians insisted that every page that used `` republic of macedonia '' or `` macedonian ( s ) '' to have a rather long disclaimer telling about how wikipedia does n't support the macedonians claims to be macedonians , or the name of `` republic of macedonia '' instead of fyrom . 
  * fopog ( former ottoman pa\u015fal\u0131k of greece ) is annoyed by the name of macedonia ( even though the country does contain parts of the ancient province of macedonia ) , so the country is occasionally known as `` fyrom '' ( `` former yugoslav republic of macedonia '' ) . 
  * greece was also annoyed by [ their flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_the_republic_of_macedonia_1992-1995.svg ) ( based on alexander 's vergina sun ) , so macedonians had to change this as well . 
  [ we 'll bring them just to prove the other balkanians that ours are better .

  also , soros , who is both a hungarian and a jew ( double conspiracy points ) , is trying to do something nasty to us !, 
   there are sympathisers of catalan separatism in valencia and the balearics , but a majority of the population ( a very large majority in valencia ) are hostile . 
  in a bus in mallorca , i witnessed a political discussion between a very militant catalanist elderly lady ( in her 70s , speaking catalan ) and a middle age guy ( speaking castilian ) who wanted to remain with spain . 
  the elderly lady said that everyone in her family considers themselves catalan and she was quite informed in the arguments for independence . 
  quite entertaining , especially the way they each spoke their own language . 
  same for us , romanians with the hungarians . 
  still a lot of idiots ( on both sides ) who love a bit of conflict . 
  the romanians will bring some , too , but at the same time we 'll argue we 're not balkanians . 
  there are enough resources to end poverty . 
  there is no political will to end poverty , but it is not impossible .

  how funny that impurities are found in wines only when the relationships with other ex-ussr countries sour . 
  same thing happened to georgia in 2006 : [ they found impurities in georgian wines and mineral waters ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4976304.stm ) . 
  there were reasons why greece was thought by the `` markets '' of being the weakest link in the eurozone . 
  widespread corruption and keeping a high debt ( to foreigners ! ), 
  even throughout the booming period were mistakes on their part . 
  but the same crisis is happening in spain , which is not as corrupt and it had very little debt before the crisis , but it was simply thought by the markets as being `` weak '' due to its structure of the economy , or ireland , due to its bank problems . 
  no , it was n't a bubble because its economy was quite solid and diverse . 
  tourism , industry , services , constructions , mining , agriculture etc. 
  a rather healthy mix . 
  the problem was definitely not in the structure of the economy . 
  however , the greek economy had an achilles ' heel : it had a high debt as percentage of gdp and this debt was owed to foreigners . 
  other countries , like japan , have much more higher debt levels than greece , but the debt is owed to their own people , who will not try to get rid of it . 
  of course it 's easy to find faults in the greek administration ( and that would be correct ) , but the truth is that the downfall of the greek economy was caused by austerity , which was a natural response to the rise in interest rates ( reaching a peak of 39 % in 2012 ) , which were due to investment banks thinking that greece is the weakest link of the eurozone . 
  basically , the downfall happened because bankers thought it will happen . 
  a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
  the string quartet also played [ metallica ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwui7-0uiok ) . 
  probably the part of happiness that is not explained by any reasons ( financial , social , freedom , healthy life , etc. ) . 
  for instance , mexicans are happy , but they do n't have that many reasons to be . 
  we have the same joke in romania and we also castrate them and release them . 
   i do n't believe he 's still in the social-democrat party . 
  dragnea , a psd leader , after n\u0103stase 's conviction : [ `` the social-democratic party does n't dissociate from adrian n\u0103stase ; the n\u0103stase era is not over '' ] ( http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/dragnea-psd-nu-se-disociaza-de-adrian-nastase-era-nastase-nu-s-a-terminat-9778190 ) . 
  based on what mainstream politicians say , it seems they 're afraid that protests would continue to escalate , so this concession is meant to let the steam off the movement before people voice other demands . 
  a big concern is the fact that the protesters oppose all current political class due to its corruption and they might request some different system to deal with the omnipresent corruption . 
  for instance , social-democratic leader and former prime-minister n\u0103stase ( who spent last year in prison after being convicted for corruption ) said that it 's `` not a good thing to let alternative politics [ literally `` antisystem mechanisms '' ] gain a foothold in the country '' . 
  ungheni , about 50 km from pite\u0219ti . 
  not hard to pronounce by any standards , so that is wrong . 
  westerners could have used the old celtic name , serdica , from which the slavic name is derived . 
   they do n't like the russians .

  it 's human nature , prison maybe , but i doubt there are clean politicians in our part of the world , a few are stupid enough to get filmed confessing but that is another story and hardly justifies the death sentence . 
  both , traditionally the magyars , but they are spiced by rmdsz 's political disloyalty . 
  but they are the most brainwashed part of romania by the nationalist comunist rethoric . 
  the way i see it even the most disadvantageous split , 5 regions ( now the minimum option is 6 ) , gives the magyars more political power , more funding and a chance to break their current isolationism . 
  i really do n't see the practical downside , compared to the limbo they are now . 
  as primitive as the acusation that we 're changing our constitution just to fuck with them 2 . the romanian govermend does n't give a fuck period . 
  magyars are treated with equal political indiference as the rest of us . 
  and they de facto had autonomy , the most blatant corruption cases are from that part of the country , mostly because bucarest rarelly intervened before 2005-2008 . 
  also along the last 20 years bilingualism became widely used even in regions that do n't have a significant magyar minority . 
  transylvania was never yours like hungary was never austrian , or bosnia serbian , it has a different etnical composition , the only reason we have our current etnic problem is that the communists invented a magyar theoretically autonomous region as per [ the soviet recipe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_delimitation_in_the_soviet_union ) . 
  in the rest of transilvania magyars and romanians live and work side by side without any hate . 
  `` both hungarians and romanians sound ridiculous when they say the other side started it . '', 
  i 'm not talking about traditional conflict that is bullshit , but the modern status quo and that has a guilty party . 
  rmdsz has complete political control at the local level and has been in the opposition only for 4 years out of 22 years of democratic government , but has done nothing for the region , and to compensate and still get the support has gone on tirade after tirade of anti romanian rhetoric , to mask their indifference and/or incompetence ( although they have profited greatly financially as individuals so i ca n't really prove the incompetence part ) . 
  they are the ones that amplified the situation and the only ones that actually benefit from the conflict 5 . everytime there is a political stalemate and rmdsz 's stable 7 % could be decisive , `` a automy option '' is dangled in front of the magyar electorate ( discretely so romanians do n't even notice ) . 
  rmdsz chooses the side that proposed it , its leaders get rich because of back door deals . 
  then the solution disapears , but rmdsz still supports the goverment because they got paid , at election time rmdsz goes to its electorate and cries `` they cheated us '' , the electorate increases its anger toward romanian politicians . 
  romanians hate the influence rmdsz has on the political balance , and because of this you have indirect hate between romanians and magyars despite not even meting each other . 
  ( bucharestians hate them way more than transylvanians ) 6 . actually having an autonomous region would be catastrophic for rmdsz , they would have actual political competition , and with fiscal independence they would actually have to do something more than ask for more ethnically correct national policies . 
  you still have n't mentioned why you think the opposition leaders in you country deserve jail time . 
  i agree , i have no right to speculate , and i sincerly hope you are right . 
   however , once again , you 're speculating opposesrs of the government will be imprisoned no , i just asked for your insight on that one , you are overly defensive and did n't answer my question why would you , 100courics would like to see those politicans specifically in jail ? 
   redistricting entire regions of the country just to dissect the power of ethnic minorities . 
  if your worried about nationalist policies , start with protesting that . 
  1 . they do n't have any power now , so the actually do n't loose nothing 2 . the main purpose of the redistricting is n't to piss of the magyars , nobody really gives a fuck about them 3 . 
  i agree the talks are disregarding the wishes of that etnic minority and that could look like nationalistic , but the hatred they manifested for over 20 years generated this . 
  you do n't use nationalistic anti romanian speach for that long and expected to be greated with flowers and autonomy when the subject occurs . 
  4 . and because of that the common sense solution ( my prefered option ) of making a region for the magyars is disregarded and only used as political bait for the rmdsz and its supporters . 
  sorry for the `` stefan '' and `` magyar '' i do n't know the rules to hungarian-english translations . 
  i to thank you . 
  it has been quite fun . 
  i fond that the young are by their nature reactionary and trapped in a confimation bias routine that only amplifies their misguided belief . 
  but i blame the lack of random encounters in our modern world for that one . 
  everyone is part of a `` church '' that is the social norm , and when you encounter someone that is not of your church you 'll rhetoric will have the backing of `` tribal '' knowledge . 
  i do not believe class conflict ( not negeserally in the economic sense ) can have a positive effect . 
  irl the losers always resent the winners and that fuels counterrevolutions . 
  and the winners rarely change more than labels . 
  society does not progress by laws or rights , be them as righteous as individual freedom or equality . 
  only acceptance and assimilation of those principles by society as a whole can be counted as actual ( irreversible ) progress . 
  yes , on a individual level , when confronted by ignorance , you should not be apologetic if his labels mean more than core objective human values . 
  but as a society using ration and objectivity to increase gaps is most unproductive and falls under the sin of failing to see the forest , the progress of society for the trees , labels , one 's own ignorance and pride . 
  educating an ignorant man , or even cracking his bias with a tough provoking conversation is much more valuable and effective than pummeling his ignorance into the grown for the sake of ones ego . 
  i personally like eminovici 's work , the only romanian clasicist that i feel is actually talented and not only talented enough to be a romanian elite . 
  we teach the drab stuff because we need to maintain the illusion that he was a romantic , that romanian culture was in line with world heritage . 
  we even turned the sad `` last of the romantics '' as a title , a kind of `` the greatest '' . 
  it 's also way easier to teach vulgar romanticism that german philosophy to kids ( socilalist style education ) i think the socialist created the spoon feed model , by restricting alternative sources and making ( state ) education a universal policy . 
  the rise of `` alternate history '' is reactionary to that policy , and exacerbation of historic importance is a way to compensate for our drab present and and objectively reactionary history . 
  while not letting go of our nationalistic ego , the communists over inflated . 
  i do n't find dialogue helpful , the age difference and the defensive nature of people when you 're touching on their `` support '' beliefs , makes them irrational and contrarian . 
  you may find my aproach to complacent but i see it as the only actually productive ( pragmatic in a `` ends justify the means '' type of way ) option , i reach out toward their intrinsic humanism , i do not care if someone worships shiva or zamolxe , we either meet half way using humanist rational or not . 
  people are extremely creative when motivated and nothing motivates them more than not being on a moral grounding . 
  so i let them rationalize their way out of stupid beliefs , rather than dragging them out kicking and screaming . 
  and with the history aspect , our generation writes the next history and literature school programs , let them enjoy a naive death . 
  < populism is a political doctrine where one sides with `` the people '' against `` the elite '' .  i.e. 
  the reason bread prices are so high is that the govemenrs play 400 fat asses . 
  200 idiots are more dangerous that 400 , from a political standpoint i do not doubt for a second the popularity of fidesz , but does n't the one round voting system help the ruling party stay in power , especially in fucked up democracies like our where there the influence of the opposition is ridicoulsly weak . ( i.e. 
  mass media and the justice system seems blind to those in in power ) . 
  also you do n't rig election , if you have popular support you only make it more diffult for the other guys to challenge you . 
   opposers of the goverment will be accused of lack of patriotism and silenced if fidesz wins another round of election , but by a smaller margin ( which currently i do not doubt they will ) they wo n't remain as passive . 
   none of the leftist activist or politicians have been imprisoned ( to the despair of many hungarians ) . 
  why ? 
  have they done serious crimes , or where they just corrupt and indifferent to the people , in which case i assure you that all politicians are guilty of that , but the media spotlight is just directed by the people in power . 
  i do not care if orban is awarded the crown of king stefan , and proclaimed king for life , it 's your country . 
  i however do n't want a nationalistic government as a neighbor , considering the bilateral tensions that still haunt the more stupid of our populous . 
  and during his last mandate , probably because of a lack in support , he increased his nationalistic rhetoric and the fascist grip on power ( constitutional changes ) and this, 
  this is bullshit , without a organic growt capital injections will only increase corruption and income disparity . 
  neither russia or the eu should intervene in this case imo . 
  but this is debatable because nobody has time anymore for organic growth , everyone wants everything immediately if not sooner . 
  but from that keynesian argument to `` give russia free trade zone '' to help the ukrainians this guy pulled some wild mental gymnastics . 
   if you 're a culture pessimist , why not go out of the way for the people who do have the energy to try ? 
  being a optimist does n't change the fact that eco tech is still financially unviable . 
  solar has the smallest return rate and is the most expensive option to reach energy autonomy.unless you have vast surfaces of unused terrain like spain or algeria stop with that fantasy . 
  your best bet would be wind or wave . 
  no , this is a eu matter , you do n't have the money to call it an internal policy . 
  i normally would agree , but in this particular case , the parallel is really accurate , you 're asking for money to invest in modernizing your energy market despite it being a process to expensive for other countries to implement or the fact that you have macroeconomic issues more pressing to attend to . 
   bleakness of communist housing the aestetic issue was not the problem with communist housing . 
  what conditions does someone need to fulfill to become eligible ? 
  less seats means less vulnerabilities for the ruling party , the argument 4oo mouths costs more than 200 is primitive and populist . 
  1 major corruption case spends more than the government spends on all parliament in in all of its mandate . 
  how ? 
  if there is no second round , and only 3 major parties ? 
  you basically lowered the bar from 50 % to 33 % for fidesz to stay in power . 
  look after the election of to how many people actually voted for them and rethink my `` rape '' metaphor . 
  you suffer from seeing history trough a theoretical filter , the `` it ca n't happen to me , the present is more civil than that '' . 
  authoritarianism rarely happens over night , it is a gradual process that solidifies it 's absolute authority . 
  at first they direct hate only to foreigners but as their interest become separated from their electorate they move that hate against their own people , and people have blind faith in autority , they will not react at the first abusive measure , nor the second . 
  opposers of the goverment will be accused of lack of patriotism and silenced , congratulations the government has become the party , and your not invited to the banquet , your only needed to work the kitchen . 
  but maybe i 'm to much into this and hungary will grow into the sweden of the east , and all of fidesz 's reforms are for the better of the nation . 
  how can poor people afford living there ? 
  is n't property prohibitively expensive ? 
  there are n't countries without a `` drug problem '' , except for totalitarian countries , that apply systemic solutions to life in general . 
  my solutions where systemic ( tweaks to the system , not more money , more police as in the war on drugs ) , they solve the issue not by the number of cases prosecuted , but by making the behavior unattractive to a rational individual . 
  there will probably be a lot of cases in the first 2 months , but then they would be fewer and fewer as time goes on , after 5 years a traditional system would prosecute many more cases , while under my `` theoretical system '' traditional bribery would cease to exist . 
  i say traditional because some people will be inventive , naked negotiations or bribery by proxy could become the new methods . 
  then you again create a framework to make that behavior unattractive and so on , until the basic act of accepting a bribe is counterbalanced by the social stigma of accepting it ( sweden ) . 
  literacy does n't trasfer into culture or virtue , if you censor anything that is `` antiproletarian '' . 
  i was just pointing out that religion is a simptom of the cultural void in eastern european cultures , but apparently the dam of / r/romania broke and angst spilled over in this tread , quite encouraging , the old are hopeless and the young are just plain stupid . 
  oh , cool , sorry for the rant , i understood you want reform based on the idealisation of ancestors , which is quite a popular cognitive masturbation , national ego combined with the rejection of modernity , quite powerfull , you keep the parts you like and pretend the stuff you did n't like are a mistake or never happened . 
  objectively , we are no special snowflake , your suggesting we look inwards to invent a romanian wheel out of nationalistic pride while the rest of the world developed sistematic agriculture . 
  we fundamentally are n't romanians , that is a label imposed on us by nations much more powerfull than us to separate their selfs from us .

  practicing muslims are only 6 % of the population . 
  is that half ? 
  is 6 % also half in your eyes ? 
  right wing is very different from pis , they are way closer to the far right than conservatives in the uk for example . 
   in brussels , about half the children in state schools opt for classes in islam , although this figure excludes the large share of youngsters who attend private , mostly catholic schools . 
  are you blind to the second half of the sentence ? 
  typical far righter . 
  only sees what he wants to see to confirm his shit theories . 
  so if a `` large share '' attend catholic private schools and they are n't counted , does that mean to you that half of all the school children in brussels are muslim ? 
  is that the argument you 're going for ? 
  no wonder the far right seems like a good idea to you . 
  with critical thinking skills like these , it truly is no surprise that you eat that shit up . 
  man , i 'm still waiting for you to acknowledge how much of a liar you are . 
  come on , do it . 
  too bad repeating that over and over does n't change the fact that a. far right parties have risen a lot in popularity b. it correlates with google trends as a result . 
  of course , if you deny the very existence of the far right in europe today , you might believe your bullshit post . 
  that 's a pretty good way of classifying it . 
  not sure what you were expecting . 
  people have kind of went off on the extreme ends on the spectrum , but the far right seems to be winning . 
  are you fucking nuts ? 
  if the far right has become popular in recent years it 's obvious the trends on google are going to increase compared to the far left . 
  if you ca n't even see common sense there 's no hope for you . 
  i do n't know , i think the mods have calmed down a bit now , they probably figured out that banning is n't the way to go . 
  this topic is kind of proof of that . 
  come on . 
  do not fear the ban . 
  a break from this subreddit might do you some good anyway . 
  what facts dude ? 
  you claimed the russian economy is growing despite the fact that they 've been in a recession for like a year and a half now . 
  it was a prediction . 
  was n't a bad one either . 
  topics like these do get downvoted a lot . 
  when you do n't agree with something , burn it down . 
  the motto of the far right . 
  because what 's more logical than committing crimes and acting like barbarians while simultaneously accusing others of being barbaric . 
  islamist logic does n't stop at islam , as we can all see , or could see , if they would n't be busy downvoting this topic . 
  it currently says it has 8 points out of 50 votes , a 58 % upvote ratio . 
  there 's clearly a lot of people downvoting this topic . 
  why ? 
  some do n't want others to see that many on the far right are a bunch of criminals , they 're just different sides of the same coin as islamists , people blinded by hate and ideology to the point of violence . 
  some people might say that 's no excuse to start burning shit down . 
  the far right and the far left are actual terms , not `` statistical concepts '' , if europe has seen a rise in the popularity of far right parties , of course it 's going to correlate with trends on google . 
  it 's really not that hard to understand . 
  the far left is almost non-existent in europe today , of course it 's going to get less searched than the far right which has been rising and rising in popularity . 
  romania will never align itself with russia . 
  at least not in this century . 
  there 's way too much distrust and many people rightfully blame russia for the instability in the region . 
  basically , we 're doing this exercises * because * of russia . 
   in brussels , about half the children in state schools opt for classes in islam , ** although this figure excludes the large share of youngsters who attend private , mostly catholic schools . 
  ** are you blind to the second half of the sentence ? 
  typical far righter . 
  only sees what he wants to see to confirm his shit theories . 
  so if a ** `` large share '' ** attend catholic private schools and they are n't counted , does that mean to you that half of all the school children in brussels are muslim ? 
  is that the argument you 're going for ? 
  no wonder the far right seems like a good idea to you . 
  with critical thinking skills like these , it truly is no surprise that you eat that shit up . 
   past = / = present . 
  you ca n't say `` it will '' . 
  insanity : doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results . 
  you have it . 
   far-right because they pretend to be so afraid of the past . 
  yes , the positive aspects of the far right , such as completely destroying democracy , disregarding law , genocide , causing the most destructive war the world has ever seen . 
  truly marvelous achievements . 
  i must be crazy for not looking at all those `` positive aspects '' . 
   how can you be accepting of a minority that is against your culture and history by thinking of it as `` lesser '' , yet be for your nation at the same time ? 
  you clearly are against your nation as you are ignorant , or possibly in denial ( in which case you 're as bad as a neo-nazi ) , about foreign cultures . 
  you 're seriously making my points without any help on my part . 
  you 're clearly fucking insane . 
  i 'm against my nation and i 'm quote `` as bad as a neo-nazi '' because i 'm not against muslims ? 
  you know what i 'm against ? 
  morons on all sides that have nothing better to do than make the world a shittier place , probably because their own lives suck so much and they have failed so badly at being adjusted human beings that they live their lives blaming anyone else but themselves . 
  that 's what i 'm against . 
  far righters are just as bad as islamists , they 're both different sides of the same coin , idiots driven blind by ideology and hate . 
  you 're pretty confident about your chances with romania are n't you ? 
  i 'm not sure at this point whether you 're being willfully ignorant as to what ethnic cleansing means , or you 're just proving my first point . 
  ethnic cleansing is also done through population transfers , as in intentionally and purposely mass transferring ethnic russians in estonia in order to achieve the goal of ethnic cleansing . 
  hmm , i wonder if it has anything to do with the rise of the far right throughout europe in the past few years . 
  nope . 
  it ca n't be that right ? 
  obviously it points to labeling , not actual real world tendencies that correlate with the popularity of those terms . 
  / s it 's really no surprise , any time i debate anything with a far righter , it takes about 2 minutes for them to show a complete lack of any kind of critical thinking skills . 
  hence the predisposition towards such populist parties . 
  do you have any idea about the history of the far right and how it affected the nations in which they have risen to power ? 
  because it really really seems like you do n't . 
  the far right is extremely authoritarian in nature and every time they have gotten into power they have eroded democracy and the rule of law . 
  that 's what 's at stake here , not your shitty theory on `` replacing demographics '' or people opening up their legs to muslims . 
  like what . 
   unfortunately looking back i lost the vienna article and ca n't seem to find it of course you lost the article . 
  it does n't even exist . 
  or at best it came from the colon of the internet . 
  as for your article on belgium :  among all respondents , 20 % called themselves practising catholics and 43 % non-practising catholics ; 6 % were practising muslims and 1 % non-practising muslims i 'm really really starting to worry about your text comprehension . 
  if only 20 % still think of themselves as christian , and 6 % declare themselves as muslim , i really wonder how in your tiny mind does that mean a demographic replacement . 
  are you going to blame muslims now for the fact that more and more people are atheists in the west ? 
   that self-hate . 
  nah , it 's not self-hate , it 's just a lack of hate towards entire minorities . 
  you may be confusing the two , since in the mind of far righters , if you 're not against < insert minority here  , you 're against your nation . 
  such is the nature of the far right though . 
  it divides , it calls people that oppose it unpatriotic , it justifies hate and discrimination using bogus arguments such as `` demographic replacement '' and it uses rhetoric such as the nation being under the threat of destruction to rile up idiots like you . 
  to what end ? 
  for power of course .

  the czech republic , estonia and romania have about as much in common as austria , norway and portugal ... 
  yes .

  though `` c\u0103t\u0103 '' makes me think `` transylvania '' . 
   brasov dialect sounds like `` southern light '' , although if i tell that to the locals they do n't like it lol , i bet they do n't . 
  that being said , i would prefer `` standard '' or `` muntenian '' rather than `` southern '' :d, 
  that 's very hard to answer since , until the mid-19th century , we only have written record from the nobility and clergy which always had a lot of contact with their counterparts in the other principalities . 
  i 'd say that , in the past , moldavia and wallachia probably formed a dialectal continuum . 
  it 's actually a popular joke that buzau and braila , the easternmost counties in wallachia , are in moldavia because ... well ... they speak that way ( a bit ) . 
  if you consider [ aromanian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aromanian_language ) a dialect of romanian , then ... everything . 
  it 's pretty much a separate language with some degree of mutual intelligibility with romanian . 
  aside from that , a * very * thick moldavian accent can sometimes be hard to understand if you 're not used to it and oltenians are the only ones to use the perfect simple colloquially , but i would n't say either constitute radical differences .

  my impression was the following : the accent in the republic of moldova is pretty much the same as that in romanian moldova but on steroids + some russian loanwords . 
  if you 're comfortable with dul\u015fi grai , you 'll understand people from the republic just fine . 
  that being said , while meat is very important in romanian cuisine , we do have quite a few vegetarian dishes since a lot of people still keep fasts . 
  they might even be vegan dishes , i 'm not really sure how fasting works . 
  what 's a vegetarian ? 
   measuring those things by volume is still very easy . 
  honestly , i 've always found it awkward and imprecise . 
  even for things for which volume * is * easy to measure . 
  i do it when absolutely necessary ( new recipes , etc. . . ) but , overall , i just use a kitchen scale and measure by weight . 
  lol . 
  romania : [ this is old as fuck but still pretty accurate/relevant ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ziwsvfvg2w ), 
   they kinda dug it up in the 19th century , like everyone else . 
  yes and no . 
  romanians , or at least the educated class among them , started identifying with latin europe at least as early as the 17th century when the moldavian chronicler grigore ureche stated that `` we came from rome '' ( de la rim ne tragem ) . 
  even before that , wallachia had some commercial and cultural ties to the italian city-states ( particularly genoa and venice ) which cemented this idea . 
  the secretary of petru cercel , who was genovese , wrote that the wallachian language was `` a corrupt form of latin . '', 
  there was however a dispute during the 19th century between the transylvanian school ( which saw romanians as an integral part of latin europe ) and moldavian and wallachian thinkers ( which saw romanians as more of a mix between latin , slavic and greek influences ) . 
   romania had replaced slavic words used not really , though it was tried . 
  the percentage of latin words in romanian has grown because we adopted a lot of new words in the 19th century ( indeed , mostly from french ) . 
  however , attempts to replace existing words mostly failed . 
  i do n't know anyone who uses `` nea '' instead of `` zapada '' for snow or `` arina '' instead of `` nisip '' for sand . 
  the oldest recorded text in romanian is from the early 16th century and , [ once transliterated from cyrilic , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neac%c8%99u's_letter#transliteration_from_cyrillic ) it 's relatively readable so the language has n't changed * that * much . 
  yup , and `` oui '' comes from `` hoc ille '' via the medieval `` o\u00efl '' . 
  nothing is known clearly but , from the existence of historical minorities , we can guess that the [ principality of wallachia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wallachia ) : * encouraged the immigration of romanians ( or , more precisely , romance-speaking orthodox ) from moldavia and transylvania by granting tax exemptions ( moldavia and transylvania did the same ) * tolerated the immigration of non-muslims from the ottoman empire ( mostly bulgarians , some armenians , greeks and jews ) ( moldavia did the same , not sure about transylvania ) * tolerated the immigration of saxons ( or , more precisely , german-speaking catholics ) from transylvania in some areas ( campulung and targoviste in particular ) ( moldavia did the same ) * discouraged the immigration of muslims from the ottoman empire as a way to distance itself from it ( moldavia and transylvania did the same ) * gypsies were [ a special case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_romania ), 
  your bread is sweet . 
  even the bread that supposedly is n't still is a bit . 
  it was n't a complete culture shock since i had lived in canada before that ( and their bread is also sweet ) , but i 've never managed to get used to it . 
   all religous groups and ethnicities were treated equal for most of its history [ uhh ... 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unio_trium_nationum )  what you did under the ceau-era is just blatantly outrageous , and it continues trust me , it sucked for everyone . 
  and i 'm not sure why you think the current situation is the same . 
   trust me , we do n't feel your understanding either . 
  i was talking about me personally . 
  we definitely have plenty of `` gb2 mongolia '' types . 
  you know , i understand transylvania 's historical significance for hungarians , but i wish more hungarians would understand its historical significance for romanians . 
  setting aside any pissing contest and politicized history , it is widely accepted that [ wallachia was founded by a noble from fagaras ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wallachia#creation ) , [ moldavia by a noble from maramures ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldavia#high_middle_ages ) and that the first recorded romanian polities straddled both sides of the carpathians ( litovoi in gorj + hateg ) . 
  it is also a matter of historical record that wallachia kept the duchies of amlas and fagaras and moldavia those of maramures and , later , ciceu ( albeit under hungarian suzerainty ) until the late 15th century , and that wallachia maintained some fortresses in fagaras until the early 16th century . 
  in fact , this was the main reason wallachia managed to keep some degree of statality . 
  there were three attempts to turn it into an eyalet of which two - [ 1522 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radu_of_afuma%c8%9bi#reign ) and [ 1595 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_c%c4%83lug%c4%83reni#aftermath_of_the_battle ) - were repealed only due to the fact that wallachia could use transylvania as a safe base from which to launch a decisive counter-attack . 
  tl , dr : the region is central to both our country 's history , and i wish both sides would try to understand and respect that a bit more . 
  [ baked , yes .

  that article seems to conflate beauty standards ( i.e. 
  physical traits considered attractive ) with cultural norms ( such as scars or tattoos ) . 
  anyway , to answer op , having lived in both romania and the us i 'd say the only real difference is that men in the us tend to prefer curvier women while men in romania tend to prefer thinner women . 
  i 'm with team usa on this one , in case you 're curious . 
   they 'd probably say '' oooh , prostitutes and cheap labour '' lousy poles , going to italy to steal * our * jobs :(, 
  i agree with your general point but , just to nitpick , `` wallachia '' and `` wallachs '' ( or any variant thereof ) are n't used by romanians at all , it 's an exonym , so the situation is n't that similar . 
  a better analogy would be with moldova ( the country ) and moldova ( the region in romania ) . 
  and we do n't lose our shit about that either ( though we do call the country `` basarabia '' informally ) . 
  prussia yes , and austria too if it counts , but iirc the other german states were something of a mess .

   states with the same cultural heritage . 
  that 's not really possible . 
  it 's not unheard of , especially in mountainous areas , for a village to have a different dialect and traditions than the one next to it .

  you do realise that would be ridiculously easy to fake ? 
  every backwards fundamentalist knows what western values are , they just reject them . 
  your ancestors used to live in a church ? 
  in the case of a scexit , would it be renamed to the united kingdom of england , wales , cornwall and northern ireland ? 
  `` as european citizen '' , you are delusional if you think russia would be as contained as it is today without a us presence on the continent . 
  there 's a reason why every country bordering them is either inside their sphere of influence , or completely opposed to them and literally inviting us troops to defend them . 
  maybe once we have an eu defense force , then we can start reducing the us military presence , but until then , they are literally the only thing standing between russia and us . 
  you 're shifting the discussion . 
  what the soviet union did 50 years ago has nothing to do with what is happening today ( for one , there are no nukes involved , and kaliningrad is n't exactly comparable to the entire mainland us ) , and the point stands that if a russian ship were near the us coast today , the discussion would be about why it 's there . 
  the media is talking about the jets because there 's no question about why us ships are in international waters , protecting nato states . 
  and it 's not just about `` protecting their borders '' , as you are framing it , since they have the exact same behaviour everywhere - making provocative passes , while completely ignoring radio calls . 
  of course they should n't be shot down , that would be completely needless and beyond idiotic , but do n't claim that they 're just doing what everyone else would . 
  any normal country would just send aircraft to circle the area and * communicate * their displeasure , by * speaking * , none of this macho bs . 
  well , they only really went into the empire business after ivan grozny , before that they were just another regional power . 
  it 's hard to claim they were the worst when competing against the likes of the british empire , but they 're still the only case i know of a country annexing parts of its ally after fighting a war on their behalf . 
  ( romanian war of independence ; imagine if france had claimed massachusetts in 1783 ), 
  yes , it would be more important to know what a russian warship was doing there . 
  the us ship was there to at the request of nato states . 
  and russia since the 19th century .

   their mps  romanian flair ... wat ? 
  i 'm fairly sure none of those are surnames . 
  the medieval age generally ended before 1500 , we are talking about events taking place in the 19th century and later , when ethnicity and national identity had almost completely solidified . 
  i definitely aggree with you that any change should be accepted by a significant proportion of both nations . 
  personally , as a romanian moldavian , i 'm not even sure i want it to happen , it would be the same as south korea reuniting with the north , dragging us down economically and infrastructurally . 
  but the fact remains that moldova is a deliberate , artificial , invention of russia , making it different from other diverging countries / ethnicities . 
  any difference between moldovans and moldavians was engineered to create a feeling of otherness . 
  these people could lead much better lives if they had all the facts , but as is the case in ukraine , russia will do what it can to prevent its sphere of influence from further decaying . 
  you really are a special one , are n't you ? 
  i was referring to the fact that your statement was trivially wrong , it 's as wrong as claiming ukraine was never part of russia . 
  what is your point , anyway ? 
  ukraine is now ethnically and linguistically different from russia , has been for countless centuries , and the change happened naturally . 
  moldavians are ethnically romanian , always were ( historically , we always called ourselves vlachs or rumanians ) , and any sense of separation is due to intense ussr propaganda , so completely artificial . 
  from the perspective of the moldavian state , russia illegally annexed half of it , then the legitimate moldavian state decided to form a union called romania . 
  in 1918 , moldova itself called for union after the fall of your little empire . 
  moldova never decided to be part of russia , but both its halves separately decided to be part of romania . 
  all your points are russian propaganda , pure and simple . 
  they 've already announced they 'll go separatist if any union happens . 
  if moldova does join romania again , yes , they 'll have to let you go , you think we want an even more backwards and corrupt region than moldova , filled with ultranationalist russians like you ? 
  you 're the definition of brainwashed , they 've inoculated hatred in you for no reason . 
  i pity you , you 're another victim of russian politics , living in your little bubble of military dictatorship , and you do n't even know it . 
  right . 
  it was n't acknowledged for the same reason no one is acknowledging taiwan - they did n't want to piss off the more important ussr , which denied the validity of the union , despite it being requested by besserabia in the first place after the collapse of your little empire . 
  you 'll also note that the union spared besserabia the wonders of life under lenin and stalin for a few decades , which would have been a plus even if they 'd been russians . 
  and i 'm not sure what your point is with the second paragraph . 
  yes , the holocaust did happen . 
  what does that have to do with anything ? 
  transnistria is n't even part of historical moldavia , it was tacked on by the ussr to aid in russification . 
  russia is free to have that little shithole back if unification ever happens , though i doubt ukraine would be happy about that . 
   we do n't deserve having a country . 
  username checks out . 
  the link above literally shows that present-day moldova was a part of romania , it was that way between 1918-1941 . 
  and whether they are part of romania or not , they are ethnically romanian . 
  romania was formed to encompass all those who identified as romanian , and had done so for centuries . 
  before being annexed by russia , they were part of a romanian voyvodate . 
  them drifting away from romania nowadays is the direct result of cultural repression by russia , in every possible way ( changing the name of their language to `` moldovan '' , punishing those who called themselves romanian with execution or and deportation to siberia , use of russian in schools , resettling ethnic russians , etc ), 
  what does the name matter ? 
  they are great at what they do - providing interesting images of various stuff . 
  right , so it is fptp 's fault in the end - two-party systems are almost always the ones fptp converges to , because of its all-or-nothing nature . 
  the uk seemed to escape that for a while , then people went right back to labour and tories . 
  and yeah , the republicans have gone to puritan la la-land lately , which is why trump looks like a good alternative . 
  i think libertarians like ron paul are the closest to his viewpoint that still have a voice , albeit a small one . 
  if so many think so , then why is there no meaningful safety net in place ? 
  is it just that extreme opinions propagate because of fptp ? 
  real-life rhaegar . 
  dunno , that main chorus is catchy as hell . 
  i 've eaten plenty . 
  when it 's made well , it 's good , but a fair bit worse than the continental equivalent . 
  all the best things are imported foods . 
  yes , i am making a claim , i did preface it with `` i think '' , showing that it 's a gut feeling , i did n't bother to research , no one asked me to , i am under no obligation to . 
  but instead of acting like a smug ass , you could have easily used your own data to reach the same conclusion - by your own data , over 130 people died without there being an attack in progress that caused the intervention . 
  in europe , there were around 150 deaths from terrorism last year . 
  accounting for population difference , the result is clear , by your own argument , and this is completely ignoring non-police shootings . 
  like several others , you 're confusing `` higher chance '' with `` high chance '' . 
  of course there 's a tiny chance of any of these happening , but these us events are more likely than terrorist attacks in europe , especially given a population well in excess of 1 billion . 
  just trying one more time : you are a us citizen . 
  you are minding your own business . 
  there is a chance that , one day , you will get killed by police mistaking you for a criminal and going gung-ho with a gun . 
  you can quantify that chance , mathematically say that you have a particular probability of that happening to you , regardless of who you are . 
  that is random , and can be compared to the chance of being killed by a terrorist . 
  * please * , i 'm actually really curious here , what in that is not logical ? 
  oops .

   i 've just pointed out the technical holes in the argument . 
  what technical holes ? 
  you 've arbitrarily given a definition to freedom of movement based on what you think it is and made statements with no facts or arguments to uphold them . 
   it depends on what you call `` free trade . '', 
  my point exactly . 
  movement of people provisions are directly proportionate with trade provisions whenever a free trade deal is involved . 
  this is not a black or white issue . 
  these things are always negotiated . 
   what problems ? 
  the early vote to get a bigger majority that ended with a hung parliament . 
  the dup deal to form a majority . 
  the dup have a similar agenda to isis , except for terrorist acts . 
  yep . 
  nothing to see here . 
   freedom of movement is when people can move around without a need for visas and can work freely in these places . 
  there are various rules and regulations that may or may not restrict this in regards to the duration or conditions of each stay . 
  it 's not a black or white issue . 
  by your logic , there is no such thing as `` free trade '' because each country has a different free trade agreement . 
   that point does n't become true just because you watered down the definition of freedom of movement to the point where it covers temporary work visa and visa-free travel for 30 days . 
  it 's not `` watered down '' because it 's not a black or white issue . 
  by your logic there is no such thing as `` free trade '' because it 's different for each country that has a free trade agreement . 
   that is simply not true . 
  why ? 
  because you say so ? 
   free trade can happen without freedom of movement . 
  they 're not mutually exclusive . 
  ** prove it . 
  ** give me one example of a free trade agreement between countries that does n't involve provisions about movement of people . 
   that 's why freight companies exist . 
  do n't people work for those freight companies ? 
  do the trucks/boats/planes drive themselves ? 
  are n't services involved ? 
  do n't you need people handling orders and legal matters ? 
  do n't these people need to move and stay in the other country if they want to move goods from one point to another ? 
  people are always involved . 
  and it 's not a black or white matter , meaning that there are various degrees of freedom of movement which is directly proportionate with the free trade deal provisions . 
   and if nafta would contain freedom of movement the numbers would be very different . 
  you just moved the goal post . 
   with mexico being a much less wealthy country than canada , more mexicans would move to the us if they could . 
  there are always limitations . 
  this is exactly my point . 
  it 's not a black or white issue . 
  trade and movement of people go hand in hand and are always directly proportionate . 
   ca n't find the term `` freedom of movement '' in these statements . 
  first of all , you just moved the goal post . 
  secondly , you 're debating semantics which is the bottom of the barrel for any argument . 
   do n't get ridiculous . 
  visa free travel is not freedom of movement . 
  there are various degrees of [ freedom of movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_movement ) . 
   the visa restrictions index ranks countries based on the number of other countries its citizens are free to enter without visa . 
  [ visa restrictions index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henley_%26_partners_visa_restrictions_index ) ** this is not a black or white issue . 
   i do n't even have to look at nafta 's specifics ignorance is bliss . 
    because it is as simple as the fact there are different types of free trade agreements this only proves that the whole thing is n't a black or white issue . 
   i gave an example of one in my original comment you mentioned tpp which is n't a free trade agreement . 
  secondly , trump moved the us out of tpp in january 2017 . 
  as i said earlier , ignorance is bliss . 
   and as you 've said it 's a common market and not an area that has a free trade agreement . 
  dude , read the site . 
  it specifically mentions the [ four freedoms ] ( http://www.efta.int/eea/eea-agreement/eea-basic-features ) . 
   it covers the four freedoms , i.e. 
  the free movement of goods , capital , services and persons do you have a reading or comprehension disorder ? 
   for tourists and business trips . 
  as a german i have had this with canada for a very long time . 
  you 're shifting your goals posts , buddy . 
  these provisions take effect in stages . 
  not all countries get them at once . 
  read the article . 
   so can most other temporary work visa in basically all countries . 
   a visa is a visa is a visa . 
  this is visa free travel . 
  no visa is required . 
  again , do you have a reading or comprehension disorder ? 
   freedom of movement is a right that allows you to live , work and travel wherever you want . 
  you 've shifted the goal post again . 
   you are now debating semantics . 
  that 's the bottom of the barrel for every argument . 
  there are various degrees of [ freedom of movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_movement ) . 
   the visa restrictions index ranks countries based on the number of other countries its citizens are free to enter without visa . 
  [ visa restrictions index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henley_%26_partners_visa_restrictions_index ) ** this is not a black or white issue . 
   they obviously do n't have free movement and nothing in your comment suggests they do . 
  it 's not 100 % free . 
  nafta also does n't remove all tariffs from trade . 
   the implementation of nafta on january 1 , 1994 brought the immediate elimination of tariffs on more than one-half of mexico 's exports to the u.s. and more than one-third of u.s. exports to mexico . 
  within 10 years of the implementation of the agreement , all u.s.-mexico tariffs would be eliminated except for some u.s. agricultural exports to mexico that were to be phased out within 15 years . 
  most u.s.-canada trade was already duty-free . 
  nafta also sought to eliminate non-tariff trade barriers and to protect the intellectual property rights on traded products . 
  it 's easier for canadians to enter the us and it 's harder for mexicans to do so , as are their respective trade provisions . 
  ** this is the point . 
  trade and mobility of persons are always directly proportionate . 
   you are absolutely right here . 
  please have a look at [ nafta - mobility of persons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_free_trade_agreement#mobility_of_persons ) . 
  all trade agreements have directly proportionate mobility of persons agreements . 
   the united states has free trade agreements in force with 20 countries . 
  am i supposed to take your word for it that there is no freedom of movement ? 
  [ nafta - mobility of persons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_free_trade_agreement#mobility_of_persons )  according to the department of homeland security yearbook of immigration statistics , during fiscal year 2006 ( i.e. , october 2005 through september 2006 ) , 73,880 foreign professionals ( 64,633 canadians and 9,247 mexicans ) were admitted into the united states for temporary employment under nafta ( i.e. , in the tn status ) . 
  additionally , 17,321 of their family members ( 13,136 canadians , 2,904 mexicans , as well as a number of third-country nationals married to canadians and mexicans ) entered the u.s. in the treaty national 's dependent ( td ) status . 
   canadian authorities estimated that , as of december 1 , 2006 , a total of 24,830 u.s. citizens and 15,219 mexican citizens were present in canada as `` foreign workers '' . 
  these numbers include both entrants under the nafta agreement and those who have entered under other provisions of the canadian immigration law . 
  ...  the united states has completed negotiations of a regional , asia-pacific trade agreement , known as the trans-pacific partnership ( tpp ) agreement and is in negotiations of the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( t-tip ) with the european union , with the objective of shaping a high-standard , broad-based regional pact . 
  tpp is not a free trade agreement and trump withdrew the us from tpp back in january .

  maybe accept and mozaiq already have the idea . 
  thank you very much for the answers !, 
  super glad you took the time . 
  thing is ... people do n't want to fight for lgbt rights or any other rights when theirs are n't affected . 
  we 're willing to come out and protest for something bad that affects us all , but are we willing to take a stand when a fellow citizen is not treated the same as us ? 
  we should be with them when they need us because an injustice towards a group of people is an injustice towards us all . 
  i think lgbt people are members of the society and they deserve representation too . 
  yeah , sure , it may not be the best moment now , but we should not dismiss these people either . 
  ama ended at 19:15 : /, 
  yeah , we get that , we 're just giving feedback here , do n't worry . 
  i do hope you * never * allow a nationalistic rhetoric , even in times when europe deals with problems . 
  already tariceanu makes anti eu comments , which is very surprising to the people here because alde is a pro european party in the ep . 
  this . 
  like what would the society accept under the `` fight corruption '' umbrella ? 
  they can be clean in terms of corruption , but there are other dangers here too . 
   for the toxic ones there is no reason and means to attend . 
  nd was at antena3 quite a few times . 
  more times than our previous pm , dacian ciolos ( bless his patience ) . 
  that 's a pretty low bar in western europe where these things are n't the main issues of their society . 
  also , there will come a time when people will stop voting simply for `` anti corruption '' because it will not be an issue anymore . 
  i do n't know . 
  i 'm taking my case ... 
  i 'm more liberal than anything and while i appreciate what usr does , i also have principles i care about beyond the anti corruption fight . 
  i 'd really like someone to represent those principles . 
  i think the same goes for other people leaning other ways . 
  it does sound a bit nationalistic . 
  it 's a name far right parties in europe ( fn , afd , etc. ), 
  would like . 
  but you do n't seem to have an ideology yet so i do n't know what other options there are for you when it comes to names . 
  you should probably focus on an ideology or split up in two parties in the near future . 
  i think op just wishes usr would get better and better results so social democrats would not get a chance to govern again . 
  20 % is also what national liberals got in the parliamentary elections , while usr got 9 % . 
  national liberals and usr are both in opposition with sdp . 
   more than 20 % ? 
  that 's a little extreme . 
  that 's more than double the people that voted or them . 
  i 'm very interested to read the answers to / u/god-bless-this - mess ' questions , but here are some more : 1 . 
  given that you have n't adopted an ideology and that you 've said you have both right and left leaning people in your party , is dividing usr into two parties ( a left one and a right one ) a feasible idea for the future ? 
  while liberal people have certain principles they care for ( lgbt rights , for example , an issue you have n't adopted a stance on because of the political diversity in your party ) , many left leaning people feel like they have no party to represent them due to psd being the only option , but a corrupt one . 
  people have different priorities . 
  for example , for some people , bigger salaries and pensions , as well as smaller taxes , matter beyond principles , which makes them vote for psd . 
  psd , however , uses populism and butchers the budget to do these things . 
  do you have a plan to make your party attractive to psd voters without falling into a populist narrative ? 
  we need to understand that bigger salaries and pensions are n't necessarily bad things if we have a good management plan . 
  what 's bad is the way psd does things , where they usually make irresponsible choices regarding the budget to gain votes . 
  i think you can remember when calin popescu tariceanu judged the eu for the imposed deficit limit . 
  what 's the party 's stance on decriminalizing soft drugs and prostitution ? 
  what is the party 's opinion on the anti eu stance that calin popescu tariceanu , leader of alde , has adopted recently ? 
  how does usr see our relationship with eu and nato , especially in this complicated geopolitical context ? 
  what 's the probability of the parliament rejecting oug14 ? 
  edit : come on guys , we want our questions answered too . 
  do-bro-tits-a loool, 
  they currently do n't have that desire anymore . 
  hungarians on the other hand ... 
  i 'd also like to add that there is a clear cultural connection between latin countries , including ours , this far in the east . 
  it was n't like that . 
  yes , some words change , but overall `` the purge '' failed because it is n't as easy as it sounds . 
  it was not half slavic . 
  it 's dobrogea . 
  ayyyyyy, 
  thirteen . 
  you can , i 'm sure that at these protests no one would tell you off , but people do n't have the mentality that burning the flag = disrespecting the government so they do n't do it . 
  besides , i think eu regulations make it impossible for a flag to burn . 
  there 's red there alright . 
  some volunteers gave people colored sheets of paper during the protest . 
  there was already an event on facebook about this . 
  at 9pm everyone raised and lightened them up with their phones . 
  we also have a projection on a building which sends messages so people can coordinate ( telling us how much left before we raise the papers ) . 
  only if the parliament is dissolved . 
  which wo n't happen . 
  well , to me , he is ignorant after saying that romania 's like russia . 
  it 's your problem who you think he is , i was just giving a fair warning . 
  do n't mind him , he thinks romania is russia , he mentioned it in another thread . 
  actually it 's not different . 
  unlike the west , we are legally allowed to destroy our flag in public . 
  a lot of western countries have laws banning that . 
  but the flag waving here is different . 
  when communism fell , the hole in our flag was a symbol of removing communism from the country . 
  so it 's not like the us where they try to destroy the country 's symbols to show disapproval with the government , we protect the symbols from the government . 
  yeah , that would send a message to tariceanu . 
  as a side note , i saw someone waving slovenia 's flag this time . 
  we did n't win anything yet . 
  sure , the emergency ordinance was repealed , but there are still ways they can implement it . 
  it 's in the parliament 's hands now . 
  fuck what they think . 
  it was so cold , but that was worth it !, 
  how - you - i thought we were family ... 
  i 'd fight you on this , but you 'd surrender in no time . 
  you have been banned from / r/romania . 
  romanians look like italians . 
  do you want to go , m8 ? 
  meet me behind the blocks in 2 . 
  i 'll show you slavic !!!, 
  but tbh that has no basis . 
  we ai n't slavic . 
  have some slavic words and some people are obviously mixed , but we 're not slavic . 
  who 's the most pro eu mod and is it / u/jtalin ? 
  why do n't we hold it in bosnia on june 28 ? 
  nah , man , it did n't pass . 
  yet .

   its a policy/belief system . 
  approved of by a previous majority of people and therefore carried out by the government . 
  arguing about the word used to describe it is ridiculous . 
  simply not true . 
  globalism is a fact . 
  globalism is happening . 
  it does n't matter what the position of the uk is or what the eu does . 
  globalism is something that has been enabled by the huge advancements in technology , especially transportation and communication . 
  the world is extremely interconnected and the only natural consequences is this globalization people are fearing so much . 
  globalization is going to happen no matter how many people in the uk may be against it . 
  the question is whether you want your country to be in the best position possible to deal with this changing world or if you want to isolate and delude yourself into thinking you 'll do fine on your own while the world passes you by . 
  what it boils down to in my mind is people not wanting to accept the world is changing faster than they might like it to change while others embrace it or even want to see the process get sped up . 
  some people end up losing because of globalization while others end up winning , that 's just the nature of things , that is why humans need to be adaptable . 
  however being against this immense and in my opinion unstoppable phenomenon that is happening thanks to technology puts you on par with the ludites that were so afraid of industrialization because swaths of people will lose their jobs . 
  it 's a losing proposition . 
  the world is changing and you ca n't expect your corner of the world to remain unchanged or regress back to some idealized times when things used to be `` great '' , because that is just impossible . 
   i do n't think this is a scheme or plot . 
  just a idealistic belief system that is ultimately self destructive . 
  maybe you do n't , plenty of people do . 
  the ridiculously broad term `` leftist '' is also not my own invention , it 's being used as a starwman by certain groups and i 've seen a lot of this term thrown around including on reddit . 
  i myself have been called a leftist numerous times simply because i do n't agree with points the far right makes about immigrants . 
   africa is now over a billion people and according to the un will be over 2.5 billion people by 2050 . 
  most areas in the middle east have similar growth , egypt for example has gone from 40 million people in 1975 to over 80 million today . 
  the areas feeding this are continuing to grow at an incredible rate . 
  every european nation has went through the same population boom as recently as 4-5 decades ago , yet we have n't swarmed the earth and did n't continue growing at that rate forever . 
  you 're assuming things based on current trends and you 're assuming these trends will continue 30 years into the future , but if you consider the trends as a whole and not just on what 's going on now , the population growth in those areas is going to slow down and it 's going to plateau once development reaches higher levels , which will also slow down migration . 
  thus i do n't think your model is accurate at all . 
   this migration wave is not an ` exceptional event ' this is the new normal . 
  no it is n't , migration levels into europe have already dropped down considerably when compared to last year . 
  indeed , time to wake up and realize those people are playing big parts of the population for fools for their own political gain . 
  where it stems from is literally decades of tabloid propaganda against immigrants and the eu , scapegoating any problem society might have on groups and entities that ca n't really defend themselves against such attacks . 
  it 's been done over and over again throughout the course of history , and people are still falling for it , albeit less than they used to . 
  so if you really want to know where it stems from , that 's it , it 's playing on people 's fears and prejudices for political and economic gain by people much smarter than those they string along , seeing as how the target demographic is usually older more conservative people with less education and knowledge about the world * on average . 
  your whole post is extremely disingenuous . 
  in 50 years we will be colonized by arabs ? 
  immigration is nothing new and all i can think of when you say that is this graph : http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/03/daily-chart-15 which is to say that your perception does n't reflect reality , multiculturalism and globalism is n't an `` agenda '' and the refugee crisis was an exceptional event not a yearly occurring one so you can draw conclusions based on it . 
  demographics in itself can not be a conspiracy theory , thinking that the demographics are being manipulated by evil leftists to destroy the white race may be though . 
  i wish that were true . 
  both of them rely on that part of the population that rarely if ever use the internet , believe everything the state controlled media says and turn a blind eye to anything that comes in contradiction with their beliefs . 
  it 's like the brexit camp sprinkled with crack . 
  when romania did the same thing about half of the people that were about to go on the lists payed before that happened so they wo n't appear . 
  just two dictators trying to save face however they can in front of the people they need to look strong for . 
  the turnout was very high and the majority voted leave . 
  for all intents and purposes in a democracy that is what we call `` the will of the people '' . 
  most of them did vote as a matter of fact , and those that did n't probably did n't care enough to vote either way . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm fully aware that the whole referendum is a joke , but it 's not wrong to say that most brits want to leave , since those are in fact the results we have . 
  unless you make voting compulsory the majority is whatever the people that showed up to vote decided . 
  junker is literally worse than all of them , he 's stalin incarnate and merkel is hitler 's avatar hellbent on creating the 4 ` th reich by destroying our good old christian nations through soros ' multiculturalist and globalist agenda . 
  when you buy into those things , murdoch , putin , trump , le pen truly look like heroes . 
  russia is one and a half years into an economic recession with standards of living dropping like a stone in a lake . 
  the problem in russia is that unlike the uk where the leaders have accountability towards the electorate and will pay for fuck ups , in russia the government controls virtually all of the media and putin has zero accountability for what he brought unto russia . 
  a liberal that is siding with boris and farage . 
  the guys that are constantly spreading hate and are anti-science and `` tired of experts '' ? 
  that 's because they all think it wo n't really affect them directly . 
  it 's one thing to accept some possible future consequences you do n't really understand , it 's another entirely to find out the company you work at is moving its operations to france and now you 're shit out of luck because the economy is contracting and people are n't hiring . 
  sure there 's a lot of racist around , but hear this , it 's all justified and it 's all your fault for criticizing racists !, 
  - amazing argument, 
  understandable considering the middle finger the brits gave us . 
  if these are your best reasons to despise the eu then i really wonder how closely do you follow national politics of the member states . 
  i can guarantee you can find more shady shit being done in a year than in 10 years on the eu level . 
  how so ? 
  he was n't drunk . 
  it 's just how he is . 
  everyone knows he acts like a retard sometimes but to a lot of people it 's quite endearing . 
  he 's harmless in any case in his banter . 
  both of them imply flexibility , but none of them imply complicity in fraud . 
  otherwise why talk about moving the goalposts if you 're just going to fake the goal ? 
  i provided my opinion on why i think that stats like that are often used to justify discrimination . 
  the reason why i joined the conversation is to share that opinion , now you 're telling me i should n't have . 
  i 'm not ignoring any context , the guy asked for stats , the guy provided half the stats , and then i mentioned why i do n't think that should be used to justify xenophobia . 
  how does that imply they knew they faked everything ? 
  all you can draw from that is that the eu was willing to be flexible in their criteria , not that they encouraged greece to fake their economic situation . 
   also competence & elected and purposeful/modest bureaucracy has everyone 's best interest at hart your point is totally non-biased and fair . 
  nevermind the fact that countries willingly joined , or that they still retain a big part of their sovereignty . 
  what really grinds my gears is that you people always end up comparing eu politics which is by far one of the most sane in the world , with some abstract ideal of national politics . 
  there 's in fact quite a lot of competence , democratic legitimacy and efficiency inside the eu , this union has managed to lift a lot of countries out of poverty and into the modern world . 
  people have just forgotten all about that since the 2008 crash . 
  spain , poland , even the uk , they greatly benefited from the eu . 
  i 'm not even going to mention countries such as the ne , germany or france , which are huge exporters and are the biggest winners . 
  romania itself is greatly benefiting from the eu and that 's why most romanians love the union . 
  your point of view is extremely biased and it ignores everything good the eu does in favor of the few things you personally are not okay with . 
  he only provided stats for the 1 % of the population part and i 'm not the guy who asked for stats . 
  stats can always be so easily used to point out that some culture or some people are inherently inferior , when in fact the reasons might be very different . 
  i can have a different opinion that the guy that asked for stats ca n't i ? 
  oh please , i 've rarely if ever seen an accusation of racism that did n't have a basis for it . 
  you 're complaining about a non-issue . 
  just because you 're pretending that saying shit like sinking the refugee boats is n't racist does n't mean that it 's undeserved . 
  i 've seen comments being upvoted in which german arsonists burning down refugee centers were lauded . 
  yet if you called them out as racist , all the far righters would downvote you and tell you that you 're a monster for calling people you disagree with a racist . 
  the difference is n't bigger than what you find between locals and romanian immigrants for example . 
  what i mean to say is that while it is true how groups have different proportions of `` bad apples '' so to speak , it 's still wrong to discriminate and hate an entire group based on the actions of the minority . 
  it only serves to alienate and create more problems . 
  using stats sure is a nice way to justify hating others . 
  i do n't care if 1 % represent 6 % of your prison population , you know why ? 
  because all the rest that are n't committing crimes and are contributing to society do n't be deserved to be treated like trash or discriminated against because some of their countrymen are idiots . 
  that 's what it boils down to . 
  that 's what racism is , it 's hating on people or discriminating against them based on nothing more than their skin color , or ethnicity , religion , nationality , political leanings , gender , sexual orientation and so on . 
  nobody forced anything . 
  this is the same type of shit i see when people mention globalist conspiracies . 
  multiculturalism and globalism are happening and they 've been happening ever since we had the great technological booms of the last century .

  the authorities pretended that they can control the situation ( to not show incompetence ) but it is bullshit . 
  there are suspicions that authorities try to hide how serious the problem is . 
  there 's a suspicious group that keeps trying to impose themselves as leaders . 
  last night they also had a stage put up by someone else earlier . 
  they were booed . 
  in bucharest and other places some groups try to manipulate protesters and to a degree they succeed . 
  one of these agitators is a collaborator of the old communist secret police . 
  after the president 's meetings with parties and civil society members yesterday apparently the majority wants technocrat government and early elections . 
  edit 38 dead medics from helsinki and bergen come to help but not because officials asked , some random romanian from norway just made some calls . 
  protests continue and meanwhile senate rejected a bill that would promote transparency in state companies ( one btw is involved in the pm 's court case ) . 
  the day after the first protests , a mayor got caught taking bribe . 
  politically it becomes more and more like asia tho in time culture will align too, 
  for romanians i think it doesnt matter much how romania changes as long as the country they are in still does reasonably well ( and we have low standards ) if their current country has * big * problems then they can go to another nice country instead of romania there are some that naively think many will come back even if big changes are made . 
  it just wont be enough . 
   what i find it difficult to understand is why the protests are still ongoing . 
  i really think people like to protest now so that 's why . 
  there 's some buzz going on . 
  people do want some more people to quit btw like the ombudsman and to put pressure on how politicians negotiate now . 
   heavy burns there are many with inner burns and someone needs a new artifficial lung, 
   the primary reason for the protests , and for why the resignation was n't enough to quell the furor , can be summed up in one word : corruption . 
  this began with a nightclub fire no . 
  lots of older issues that just added up . 
  there were lots of problems with pm ponta ( plagiarism in his doctorate , indictment , indicted relatives one named at the account court , support of a controversial gold mine project , fake wealth statement , fake cv , way too many emergency ordinances , the diaspora vote at the presidentials , many corrupt ministers , lots and lots of lies * even * for no important reason , lots of other important issues ) 4th day of protests now, 
  itt conspiratards, 
  some may be well enough for that i dont think many will be moved , just some special ones . 
  there are also specialists moved here . 
  republican editor, 
  apparently production procedures werent respected explosion came from flour dust and ventilation wasnt the proper type for that flour or something like that, 
   there are too many patients with severe burns and not enough hospital beds with ventilation needed for these cases in the romanian hospitals . 
  meanwhile there 's a burns clinic that was equipped with new 9m euros worth of equipment that stays closed . 
  built by a firm close to the capital mayor ( he himself close to the health minister 's party ) who 's investigated for corruption . 
  it was actually opened 6 months ago by the minister but never actually functional . 
  there are foreign specialists here from uk , turkey , france and israel operating there were 2 spaniards burned but discharged . 
  doesnt seem serious with them, 
  psd is still in power interim is theirs too, 
   what reason do those people have to be there ? 
  they have n't been democratically elected in a formal election . 
  the constitution doesnt specify that the president can meet * only * with parties for the naming and he already met parties, 
  it 's still the same ` against corruption ' thing mainly i saw some wanting the ombudsman and head of the media regulator quit , unicameralism , technocrat government , electronic voting , snap elections , church taxes , more education money the usual . 
  i wonder if today too those 5th column type protesters came again . 
  there are opportunists trying to take over the protest movement . 
  some were asking for monarchy there are many small groups with their own wants so it 's hard to channel the protests better . 
  we 're still learning how to democracy . 
  well he is not indicted or sentenced or investigated so yes he is better but he 's an interim ( not someone really known or strong ) so he is kind of irrelevant the problem with him is helping the ex pm in his doctorate scandal but besides that . . nothing really big . 
  interim had to be someone from the government and the one the pm proposed was maybe worse . 
  hard to pick someone . 
  video here http://www.digisport.ro/sport/special/video+explozie+puternica+langa+stadion+in+timpul+meciului+fc+bra, 
  there 's a longer article on dailym@il but the bot doesnt let me post protests now again the 3rd day today anticorruption prosecutors check the patriarch for possible abuses in using official motorcades ( actually to check if it is for them to investigate . . there must be some conditions or it is for the ` normal ' prosecutors to do ) . . also a minister 's too and the general prosecutor 's a few hours later suddenly the patriarch asks forgiveness in a video the church posted on facebook ( problems with church reactions to the heavy metal music club fire event ) . 
  the apologises were poor too ` im sorry our words were misunderstood ' some kind of non apology apology, 
  if he didnt then there would be more complaining, 
  today anticorruption prosecutors check the patriarch for possible abuses in using official motorcades ( actually to check if it is for them to investigate . . there must be some conditions or it is for the ` normal ' prosecutors to do ) . . also a minister 's too and the general prosecutor 's a few hours later suddenly the patriarch asks forgiveness in a video the church posted on facebook ( problems with church reactions to the heavy metal music club fire event ) . 
  the apologises were poor too ` im sorry our words were misunderstood ', 
  the thing is it is only for them to investigate if they got some illegal gains so that is what they check otherwise it 's for the normal prosecutors which yesterday were checking minister oprea 's motorcade related to that cop 's death btw the anticorr prosecutors check the general prosecutor 's use of motorcades too, 
  he can pray to not go to jail now anticorruption prosecutors check if his official motorcades possible abuse is for them to investigate, 
   but so were the west , a private tabloid ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malaysia_airlines_flight_17#russian_media_coverage the russian government-funded [ 280 ] outlet rt initially said that the plane may have been shot down by ukraine in a failed attempt to assassinate vladimir putin , in a plot which was organised by ukraine 's `` western backers '' . 
  [ 281 ] [ 282 ] other theories propagated by russian media include : that the ukrainians shot down the plane in a botched attempt at mass murder of russian citizens or by mistake ( reported twice , in july [ 283 ] and in december [ 284 ] ) ; that ukrainian air traffic controllers purposefully redirected the flight to fly over the war zone ; and that the ukrainian government organised the attack on the plane to bring infamy upon the pro-russian rebels . 
  [ 285 ] according to the poll conducted by the levada center between 18 and 24 july 80 % of russians surveyed believed that the crash of mh17 was caused by the ukrainian military . 
  only 3 % of respondents to the poll blamed the disaster on pro-russian separatists in eastern ukraine . 
  [ 286 ] [ 287 ] [ 288 ] sara firth , a correspondent with rt , for which she had worked over the previous five years , resigned in protest at the channel 's coverage which she described as `` shockingly obvious misinformation '' . 
  [ 289 ] on 15 november , russia 's channel one reported on a supposedly leaked spy satellite photo which shows the plane being shot from behind by a ukrainian fighter jet . 
  [ 293 ] [ 294 ] many other russian media reprinted the photo . 
  the authenticity of the photo was quickly debunked by online commentators , using supporting evidence . 
  [ 295 ] the photo had been emailed to the vice-president of the russian union of engineers by a self-described aviation expert who had found it on a russian online forum . 
  [ 296 ] the aviation expert apologised to those `` unintentionally misled or disappointed '' for the use of the information stating that he `` had no knowledge or means of proving and researching if this was an authentic satellite photo or not '' and that he was unhappy that the `` informal attempt possibly became a source of yet another battle in a media war '' saying the members of the russian media organisation `` are either desperate or totally unprofessional '' . 
  did u even protest ? 
  hungary against russia lol, 
  he leaves temporarily 3 months to pray, 
  more like a bit less bad, 
  he is born in romania btw no bias with the magyar parties, 
  lol  journalist robert turcescu added that he found , by unknown sources , that authorities were ordered to distribute bodies between several hospitals in bucharest , that ` journalist ' has 0 credibility a year ago during the presidentials he said he 's an undercover intelligence agent and now he acts like normal very biased too, 
  so thats why the last one didnt really work, 
  it 's ok cuz they dont write them themselves, 
  saw images of one of the squares where it looks like 10k but there are others in other squares and going to parliament, 
  there 's reason to be pissed at him smurd ambulances arrived in 20 minutes according to witnesses and those injured at the club which is very late http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-20551627-cat-timp-ajuns-primele-echipaje-salvare-locul-tragediei-din-club-colectiv-declaratii-marturii-cotradictorii-martori-autoritati.htm talking about a club in the middle of the capital ffs, 
   people expect miracles here and now . 
  who exactly ? 
  it 's not a protest organised by some kind of group so to have few simple demands for you to understand lots of people just joined seeing something organised on social media . 
  those in power are very unpopular so it makes sense . 
  there 's criticism for the opposition too . 
  if you actually are interested in the protests you would find in the media pictures with the banners or some videos of chants and they ask ie for political change and fighting abuses and corruption . 
  these protests have been going on for maybe 3-4 hours today and the gendarmes arent giving official numbers, 
  guys i think we need more prisons, 
  orban should a raise a fence in case protesters move there if there isnt enough room here  ), 
  yeah and all the fun stuff happens in november/december for red colour parties in particular, 
  i think people are starting to like protesting i see many smiling clubs arent safe now to people go to public squares for fun ? 
  looks like fixed now or i read it wrong 50k all over is credible, 
  wtf digi says 50k . 
  must be an error . 
  maybe 50k all over the country . 
  i found a wiki page for the nightclub fire https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colectiv_nightclub_fire the protest now tho is becoming more about bigger things , change of political class . 
  romania is aiming to raise spending, 
  right now it 's like . . against everything, 
  the protests are repeated right now, 
   sri is more like the cia the cia has foreign intel role sie is the one for that here you dont know what you are talking about really, 
  numbers are bullshit because the number is state secret, 
  even a pope did it, 
  there were lots of problems with pm ponta ( plagiarism , indicted , indicted relatives one named at the account court , support of a controversial gold mine project , fake wealth statement , fake cv , way too many emergency ordinances , the diaspora vote at the presidentials , many corrupt ministers , lots of other important issues ) it all added up it only happens that now he accepted to resign in his party there was also recent leadership change and the new president doesnt care about him much , this was a good chance to get rid of him ( ponta being the ex party president ) . 
  learn what orthodoxy is !, 
  you are a puppet too,

  amusing , rage much ? 
  am i supposed to care about some vote in a country that is n't in the eu ? 
  a vote does not grant protection from the consequences or breaking a treaty . 
  i think you both agree ... he said `` 100 % incorrect '' , you might have missed the `` in '' part of the last word . 
   ugh ... we have mob rule , are n't we enlightened ? 
  i think you should stop this farce of an ama , you 've got neither the knowledge , willingness or to be quite frank the mental capacity to actually answer questions in a through manner . 
  you are not helping your case , you are confirming every expectation people have about who the `` yes '' voters were , and let me assure you , nobody thought it was the smart people . 
  i do n't give a shit about their democracy , they can have all the votes they want about anything they want , but do n't come crying after when the hammer falls on your head . 
  also making a throwaway account because you 're afraid of minus karma ... really lame . 
   my prediction is that the eu and switzerland reach some agreement well before that and that switzerland will not backdown . 
  if there 's one guy that i 'd trust about what the eu would do is the guy that 's a member of ukip . 
  / s you 're in denial about pretty much anything related to the eu , the fact that you think you can make such predictions is hilarious , i think you should run along and sell a few more things to switzerland , while you still can . 
   free trade is always good for both sides . 
  free trade is good , but do n't come over here to take our jobs , but please do send us all your money . 
  let me know when the cognitive dissonance detector kicks in for you . 
  you 've avoided the question , he asked you if you 'd regret your vote if the eu voided its bilateral treaties with switzerland . 
  all you 've answered is some platitude about sovereignty that nobody asked about or cares . 
   the eu does too much trade with switzerland . 
  not enough to justify not using the guilliotine if push comes to shove . 
  just because you might not like it and would be personally effected by it , does n't mean the rest of the 99 % of people would . 
  switzerland is too small to have any real leverage in this case . 
  they should and i think will be made an example of if they actually implement any quota . 
  if the eu would n't pull the trigger on a small , unimportant , in the grand scheme of things , trading partener it would invite other more important trading parteners to do the same , since it would prove the eu would n't have the political will to enforce its treaties . 
  this is the primary reason that i think switzerland picked the wrong place to wage a war , they simply are n't big enough for the eu to be afraid for doing something drastic if they need to . 
   sounds like the mentality of a dog-trainer . 
  i 'm not saying you 're right or that i agree with you , but i 'm just going to point out that dog-trainers work , so if your only argument is that it works than i have no problem with it . 
   and i ca n't imagine the swiss people just changing their mind just because the eu freezes some funding . 
  why would n't they ? 
  people change their minds all the time when faced with the consequences of their actions , why should this be any different ? 
   if someone , who you felt has no business of telling you anything , `` punished '' you for expressing your opinion , as is your legitimate right , what would you be more likely to do ? 
  change your opinion or push back even harder ? 
  this is n't punishment , this is a consequence of your action . 
  corporations and bankers were very likely against the vote , it 's the people in the streets that voted for it . 
  completely unsurprising and expected . 
  why would the government refuse such help ? 
  it seems to me that if anyone is an expert in flood management and on how to prevent them in the future , the dutch would probably be it . 
   they 'd probably have to negotiate that for themselves , although it would presumably play a part in the negotiations about how the uk 's national debt should be divided up . 
  how do you figure that ? 
  why would an issue like the debt have an impact on the rebate ? 
  the debt is between the uk and scotland , the rebate is between the eu and scotland . 
  they are not related at all . 
   the scottish `` yes '' campaign think that they will get opt outs . 
  which countries wo n't give them opt outs ? 
  all of them or none of them depending on how you look at it . 
  the `` yes '' campaign can lie all it wants , if scots think they 'll get all the rebates the uk enjoys just because , they are beyond deluded . 
  as for the euro , well ... once the uk forces them to drop the pound , the euro wo n't seem to bad , especially since you do n't have to join the eurozone right away , it can take years before they 'll officially adopt it . 
  the answer to all those questions is a clear `` absolutely not . '' . 
  scotland if and when it will join the eu will do so on the same conditions any of the current new members are , they wo n't have a rebate or an opt-out of the euro . 
  that 's as clear as day to anyone that 's not a moron . 
   is it that bad there ? 
  no , it 's not . 
  in fact if you 're part of the lucky ones that get payed a salary comparable to those in western europe while living here , you 'll find that romania is a great place to live . 
  the cost of living is much lower here than anywhere in the west . 
  please ignore the self haters . 
   disapora has a lot of negative connotations . 
  umm ... no it does n't . 
  i 've never heard it being used with a negative meaning . 
  it had probably more to do with the fact that it 's expensive as all fuck to visit switzerland . 
  what ? 
  no way ... bulgaria is fucking awful , but more important than that , the price difference between spending a week in bulgaria and spending a week in greece is between very small to none at all . 
  bulgaria is very expensive for what it offers , greece is a much better investment . 
  i 've been to greece the last 3 summers and the amount of romanians and bulgarians was overwhelming , i did n't see much serbs though , so i 'm not sure i agree with what you 're saying . 
  the map is accurate for romania , during the summer months the romanian language becomes like the second national language in greece . 
  comparing romania to china is simply stupid , china is a giant , with huge resources both natural and in manpower that were basically living like in the 1800s until 40 years ago . 
  china has been simply going through industrialization these passed 25 years . 
  that said ... much of chinese growth these days is a bubble , perhaps you 've read about the huge ghost cities build in the desert . 
  china is the next big bubble that 's going to blow , but it probably wo n't happen at least for another 15-20 years . 
   i would n't say it 's great news . 
  until i see a  6 % growth and feel it like it felt in 2008 and 2007 i 'd would n't say the crisis is over . 
  6 % growth is very high and would likely indicate that a bubble is being created , just like it was in 2007-2008 . 
  the growth back then was n't real , it was based on cheap credit and speculation , you should n't ever wish to go back to that . 
  if romania actually manages 3-3 .5 % growth every year for the next 5 years it would be amazing . 
   moreover , eastern european countries in the eu will never ever want to discuss limitations to the free movement of people . 
  absolutely correct . 
   what were the swiss yes-voters thinking ? 
  understanding economics is hard , but on the other hand travelling on a crowded train is easy to understand with a simple solution . 
  of course they wo n't , it would be political suicide for them to do anything else . 
  switzerland will have to suck it up or leave the single market . 
  so i guess the answer to my question is ... you are completely ignorant of how the economy works . 
  clearly you have this obsession with tva , as if that 's the only way the government gets money . 
  if somebody , anybody , anywhere , buys a product produced in the netherlands , that 's good for the dutch economy , since that means there is a demand for that product and the dutch worker that made that product will have a job and get payed and the company that employs that worker has to pay taxes for that worker , additionally the worker also has to pay income taxes on the money he received from the company , thus the government gets payed . 
  on top of all that that dutch worker also has to live , as such he has to eat and since he 's in the netherlands , he 'll buy food that he can only afford because he has a job producing something that is bought far away , and since you have this obsession with tva , that dutch worker will pay tva on everything he buys . 
  please stop posting right now ... you 've embarrassed yourself enough . 
   and this does n't make the dutch economy any better . 
  buying dutch made goods does n't make the dutch economy any better ? 
  is this some kind of joke or are you simply completely ignorant of how the economy works ? 
   it 's still over the top considering the referendum was regarding immigration quotas . 
  the topic is unimportant , trust and commitment is what 's important in trade negotiations and right now the eu does n't trust you , nor should it . 
   this has always been the case . 
  no difference now . 
  wrong !, 
  there was no proof before the vote that the swiss were n't committed to their treaties , now there is . 
  because the swiss people just sent a red flare in the air for all to see that they are not committed to respecting the treaties its government signed in their name . 
  so why bother negotiating new treaties with a country that might decide to not respect it when it wo n't suit them anymore . 
  the eu did n't break a treaty , it broke negotiations on a treaty . 
  when a nation starts behaving in a way that makes you question its commitment to the treaties it signed in the passed , stopping negotiations on new treaties seems like the reasonable thing to do . 
   that 's not what i 'm asking at all . 
  i 'm asking to respect democracy and not make a mockery of the vote , using it as a platform to scare off independence voters in scotland and catalonia . 
  this is your interpretation , but it does n't make it so . 
  this has nothing to do with either scotland or catalonia .

  thanks for the source !, 
  i did say , most of the criticism , i saw on the news , came even before the refugee situation . 
  that is exactly why i asked a hungarian person to give a more '' knowledge-able '' opinion . 
  concerning jobbik , this is interesting news , do you have source ? 
  i just did n't hear anything about them being pro-eu now . 
  though this seems to follow a trend , most anti-eu parties slowly '' moderate '' their messages to become viable to a larger electorate , same happened with podemos , ( from what i heard from some spanish people here ) for example . 
  exactly . 
  and to be honest , it is even the process to join the eu that helps a lot . 
  our anti-corruption agency was founded by tariceanu who is now it 's biggest enemy . 
  some key reforms , they where timid first steps true , but they are the founding blocks of most of our current reforms , where taken by some of our most corrupt politicians , because they wanted to win elections and decided to court the pro-eu people . 
  i saw this quote on reddit , to my shame i ca n't remember where or who wrote it , it was something like this : '' on the short term it is difficult to find new and '' clean '' politicians , the best we can do is making it electoral profitable for '' bad '' politicians to do the right thing '' it is already slowly happening in romania with pnl , who is , slowly , trying to change itself , and a new '' liberal '' mostly urban usr ( union to save romania , they should take about 5-6 % this election ) it is a long process true , but it is a start at least . 
  i really want to see how you can rape a house ... 
  now i 'm curious ... what do you do ... ? 
  sorry poland , but we are the new poster kid !, 
  i know do n't worry . 
  you have to understand though , that this goes a bit deeper then simply the eu , saying '' the west '' would actually be better . 
  we like to appear '' western '' , '' civilized '' ... etc. 
  we want to be like germany , france ... etc i actually spoke with a former teacher of mine , who is a historian , and he said this is quite a old sentiment in romania . 
  a kind of coping mechanism we used , after being ruled by either russians and turks for a lot of time . 
  allthough we are very similar with them , same religion as russia and we took quite a lot culturally from the turks , the food is the best example . 
  we tried to reconnect with our '' latin roots '' after we became independent . 
  even during the communist era , we where never that close with russia and quite friendly with the '' evil western capitalists '' . 
  we where still overwhelmingly pro-eu even in 2009-2012 during the economic crisis when our economy was pretty shit . . 
  they are , quite a lot actually . 
  our last pm ponta , recently declared : '' the epuration of the elites we saw in the past 2 years reminds me of what happened in the 50 's '' he is just angry a court took away his right to be a lawyer because he bought his license . 
  corruption in romania was at unimaginable levels , you have to live it to understand it . 
  we are improving but there is a long way to go , and having the biggest party in romania against this process does n't help either . . 
  uh ... no . 
  the romans did it , not the romanians, 
  in my opinion it is a funny but good example , as to how most romanians want to be/appear '' western '', 
  this is exactly what my aunt does . 
  she complains and says how better it was then . 
  then she goes home and and goes on facebook , on her high-speed internet to look for guys ... 
  oh common , you ca n't paint us like that . 
  it 's more then economic issues . 
  seriously it 's simply on all level of state that we appreciate the eu . 
  i remember a funny story about a road being built very slow and everyone , the media threw a fit . 
  when they found out it was because they needed to build some special passages or something like that because in that area there where some frogs who where protected by eu law . 
  everyone stopped then and changed their tune to : '' ah well yes , well it 's needed then , that 's how they do it in the '' west '' . '', 
  that high ? 
  i am honestly suprised . 
  all we hear here in romania of hungary is orban saying how bad the eu is ... etc. 
  not really on the refugee situation but on the eu in general and such . 
  i would love a opinion from someone who actually lives there !, 
  i do not know if this is sarcasm or not . 
  but i would say we actually do . 
  at least a lot more then any other eastern european country . 
  we are shit at absorbing eu funds . 
  it is social problems such as corruption and the eu insisting we keep the fight that we appreciate the most . 
  not to say the economic factors do n't matter , they do but in my experience the other things the eu does for us is what we appreciate the most . 
  not to mention a large part of romania wants to be seen as '' western '' not only economical but also culturally . 
  and us obeying the eu helps in that regard . 
  good lord , the germans might start a revolution in china . 
  udmr will govern anyway you ca n't make a majority without them . 
  and yeah i think the technocrats are better then psd . 
  great comment !, 
  i 'm still praying pnl will do somewhat decent , and udmr will join them . 
  still will be a pretty bad government but better then psd and liviu '' i a was found guilty of electoral fraud '' dragnea . 
  but my biggest hope and dream is that ciolos will join pnl after the election and just like gandalf the white he will arrive in our time of darkness to rescue us from the hordes of mordor . 
  glad to see many people leave politics out of this , and are simply happy for the athlete . 
  you can not even imagine the amount of work that goes into winning a medal , even more so a gold one . 
  my mother is a sport journalist , she motivated me to become a journalist , but i am more focused on politics and such . 
  she spend quite a lot of time in the gym with the athletes and the work and effort they put into their training is simply outstanding . 
  so i am beyond happy these athletes can compete and their hard work can be finally rewarded !, 
  i wish her , and all other athletes , good luck in the competition and hope they will be injury free and go home back happy , healthy and hopefully with a medal !, 
  and the mayor of the sector . 
  he was bribed by the owners of the club to let them open it without the necesserary papers , among them a inspection by fire fighters . 
  there where massive protests in the capital , against corruption and the politicians . 
  but the pm was already '' dead '' he lost the party leadership to a former friend who turned on him , after he lost the presidential elections , and even blocked some legislation in the parlament just to annoy him . 
  he did n't give 1 shit about those people , as some comments afterwards clearly prove , he just took the opportunity and resigned . 
  we have a tehnocrat government since then . 
  there are 2 payer rooms one for women and another for men this is true , but neither is '' main '' prayer room . 
  but no one forces you to pray , i visited numerous mosques and no one told me to pray , this is simply false . 
  i visited mosques in iraq , egypt , jordan , turkey and even libya and no one forced me to pray . 
  i was simply informed to put my cellphone on silence and my friends told me just to respectful and silent during the prayer . 
  this is extremely weird . 
  i visited quite a lot of mosques in egypt and iraq and i was very well recieved , especially in egypt . 
  i was just told , by a friend simply to not make noise and put my cellphone on silent during the prayer and then i interviewed the iman , who was very friendly . 
  in iraq i admit it was bit colder at first , but slowly they got really warm . 
  i admit i have not been in marroco so it might be different there . 
  taqiyya is/was a shia practice when they where being persecuted by the sunnis and even then , it clearly says one can deny his faith if he is under torture or his life is in danger . 
  but is and was not used often , because denying once faith is a grave sin . 
  so it was used strictly in the more extrem situations , and even then some choose to even die rather then deny their faith . 
  it 's not used to infiltrate society or other such conspiracy theories ... 
  this is getting downvoted ... 
  so sad . 
  i do n't know turkish . . agree it is funny though . 
  ataturk posters on a akp building ... now i have seen everything ... 
  '' bataia ii rupta din rai '' a better translation would be '' beatings are '' ripped/cut '' from heaven '' '' gift '' is n't that correct , in my opinion . 
  he 's become a meme , do n't even bother with him . 
  his party got like 5 % last elections . 
  vadim tudor , aka '' deport all hungarians , no eu , no nato , invade moldova now '' died and since then basescu has become quite nationalistic , my bet is he tries to get vadim 's stunning 4 % of votes ... 
  gulen helped erdogan create akp and his help was a huge part of his success . 
  now that he broke with gulen , it is clear that erdogan needs a ally . 
  he may disagree and even hate the kemalists . 
  but it is clear he wants , or more likely needs their help to fight gulen . 
  all his actions in the past weeks point to this . 
  sure go ahead !, 
  i have most of my information from turkish friends , so of course i will let turkish people use it !, 
  thanks for the info !,

  where is that asylum agency ? 
  what 's the eu 's policy on libyan government or north african security ? 
  member states failed , they failed badly . 
  do n't want to convince them . 
  you 'll never get fraudsters to admit guilt , does n't mean there 's no point in pointing them out . 
  and that 's what those people are : fraudsters . 
  we 're a decade into the `` answer is n't more europe '' period , where we 've seen every crisis under the sun from financial , to geopolitical be tackled by `` enhanced cooperation '' and `` special meetings '' with dire results , and all we hear is `` we should have even less coordination '' . 
  we 've had nationally regulated banks fail , nationally regulated corporations cheat , nationally defended borders collapse , and even national territory get annexed . 
  at this point if it is n't some niche form of intelectual fraud , it 's reckless endangerment through hard headed stupidity . 
  and every year our external enemies are getting more organized , we 're way past the days where `` unexpected disaster '' was our only threat . 
  is the eu failing ? 
  yes . 
  why though ? 
  because of the eurosceptic paralysis that has taken hold , and the subsequent atomization of effort . 
  is that true ? 
  please tell me you 're joking . 
  to begin with : sovereignty is a two edged sword . 
  ns2 does n't directly impact eastern europe in any way . 
  and germany has all right to make energy deals under the current understanding . 
  now if eastern europe got of it 's ass and actually said : fuck energy sovereignty , let 's have a council vote and prevent geopolitical dubious energy deals being made for the good of the block , the deal would falter . 
  but eastern europe does n't want to do that because it 's afraid for it 's own `` sovereignty '' so much , that it allows germany to do whatever it wants with theirs . 
  as if they 'd win in those conditions . 
  and second , point in fact , hungary used it 's energy deal sovereignty to make it 's own pipeline deal with the russians , just like ns2 . 
  amount of whinge from that : nothing . 
  not a peep . 
  the v4 can go fuck themselves honestly , they like to complain about eu/germany more than they like getting anything done . 
  because they understand each other . 
  they got a hair 's width away from a full blown proxy war with armenia-azerbaijan , but then pulled back as they were satisfied that they were both `` men of the world '' . 
  not they , and the rest of the `` illiberal democracies '' , are more keen on deconstruction of the 1990s world order and re-establishing spheres of influence and advantageous finlandized positions . 
  this is world-wide . 
  everyone is betting on the end of american dominance as the `` final arbiter '' . 
  china 's island in the south china sea , japan 's re-militarization , the saudi-iran proxy war , the land grabs in georgia and ukraine . 
  we 're the only idiots who 've put our money on an unstable presidency an ocean away . 
  power of perception . 
  we 're collectively larger than china by far . 
  but we 're also collectively invested in our own perception of irrelevance . 
  not only do we believe we 're powerless on the world stage , we need to believe we 're powerless on the world stage . 
  we need to perceive our actions as inevitably reactive . 
  our decisions as meaningless . 
  our own opinions as irrelevant . 
  each and every member state would prefer having to choose between the us , russia or china than create their own position . 
  we 're more afraid of our own position on anything , than anyone else 's . 
  we 're not a continent of adults , really . 
  we 're a continents of naughty children who want an adult to listen to and blame . 
  the eurozone and esm are member state controlled institutions , ungoverned by the eu . 
  schengen is a member state controlled institution , largely ungoverned by the eu . 
  same with borders , asylum law and immigration . 
  you 're doing what the `` answer is n't more europe '' people have been doing for the last decade : blaming the eu for not governing shit it ca n't govern , while demanding it governs even less . 
  the failures of the refugee crisis , of the eurocrisis , of dieselgate of this is simple : a europe of state council meetings , secret international negotiations , and `` do whatever you want '' policies does not work . 
  [ umberto eco 's signs of fascism number 8  ( http://www.openculture.com/2016/11/umberto-eco-makes-a-list-of-the-14-common-features-of-fascism.html )  the enemy is both strong and weak . 
  `` by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus , the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak . '', 
  active and shifting polyglotism is the only desirable future for the continent . 
  we have all been plagued by a stream of assimilation policies and it has n't gotten any better for it . 
  and having one language has n't done south america or the arab states any favors . 
  better to just specialize in what we can do best , speaking other languages , and just adapt to whatever change comes . 
  edit : i 've really got to smile at all the people giving english a default win in the future . 
  it 's hardly been 30 years since the cold war divided the world into multiple cultural spheres , barely a blink of an eye , latin and french had longer runs . 
  things change . 
  because it does n't work , and it 's the reason it 's being eliminated from future arianespace project . 
  it turns negotiations into cake-cutting exercises as each country whines about not getting a sized piece . 
  it leads inferior contractors winning proposals they should n't have gotten close to ( like europrop int . 
  for a400m , and the company who designed the harpoon on the rosetta ) . 
  it splits the production in such a byzantine way that management is difficult . 
  and it 's simply a political shitshow as each country delays funding whenever it 's displeased ( like iter ) . 
  this outputs products that are way over time and budget , due to the politiking , technically inferior and expensive , and this leads to those countries who `` won the most jobs '' loosing them all as no one wants to buy their piece of shit they ca n't even buy themselves in large numbers because all the components are so expensive because their national producers have no efficiency incentive . 
  edit : [ here is an extensive write up on the failures of juste-retour and various quotas in the esa written by a redditor ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/58bdj2/oc_what_if_esa_became_an_eu_body/ ), 
   this is the first one . 
  do n't tell me , it 's shopped ? 
  that 's england . 
  you can tell by the double decker busses in the background . 
  and nothing says more about how such things do n't show anything about goverment policy since the uk pretty much takes in no one . 
  but the point is you do n't understand the climate in germany . 
  die linke might go up and down parading a return to socialism , may 1st riots might smash against the police , but it 's a conservative country . 
  you 're taking outliers , but have no clue of the fundamentals . 
   lol , you sound like a politician ... you know the ones who talk much but do n't do absolute anything . 
  why do n't i just personally get a rifle and restore libyan and syrian government we can pay to act like a buffer state ? 
  is that the question ? 
  just because you want to `` do something '' does n't mean there is something you can actually do . 
  sometimes the rain catches you without an umbrella . 
   they are the only country with `` welcome refugees '' parades . 
  that 's why the refugees come , because they think they are welcome , and that 's germany 's and sweden 's fault . 
  they should take all the refugees . 
  i think whatever you use for a news source needs dumping for the sake of your mental health . 
  refugees , migrants and romanians are going to germany for the same reasons : it is rich . 
  nobody wants to live in a tent city in the desert when you can work under the table for actual money . 
   good luck with that . 
  never gon na happen . 
  how do you think we prevented migrations up to 2010 ? 
  magic ? 
  stop being edgy , pick up a book , go to your universities international relations talks/meetings , whatever . 
  there 's a lot you can learn . 
  after the bae-eads merger fell , i think that became inevitable . 
  also adding in the uk would pretty much guarantee juste-retour , when the goal should be eliminating it altogether . 
   no taking selfies with every refugee like the rest of politicians ? 
  you 're really making more of a big deal of this than it 's worth . 
   so why are they voting for a populist ? 
  if that 's what germans want , then give them ( refugees ) and leave the rest of europe alone . 
  because she 's good at her job ? 
  and have you really not been reading a damn word i wrote , german 's do n't want refugees . 
  they also do n't want to break human rights issues due to , well , historical reasons .

  eu already stomps on it 's members sovereignty without also having the tools to control them militarily . 
  that amount of money is nothing . 
  we spend 1 billion euros just for new apc 's . 
  and that is just one contract from a small nation . 
  also you forgot fuck carol ii and his corruption and incompetence that led to this . 
  hungary , greece and serbia have really good relations with russia while the relations with eu are deteriorating . 
  and all those 3 have certain bones to pick with other european nations . 
  hey you are still valuable to us . 
  without you we would be the worse in eu . 
  cause poland will not hold . 
  there are just 4 rivers and a lot of plains between france and russia . 
  while baltics have no chance of holding if gottland falls in russian hands . 
  romania is more lucky do to the carpathian mountains helping stop a russian invasion . 
  not you but the greek ports ... 
  what was the line again ? 
  `` germany will fight to the last american '' and if nato keeps going this way all we will be left is with usa baltics , poland and romania and at the first chance of war half of europe will backstab each other . 
  that is funny coming from someone english . 
  considering uk is cutting military spending more and more while eastern europe is building proper armies . 
  you do know that most owned land in romania is housing followed by agricultural land . 
  and such a taxation reform as in your post would backfire as the reason the land is unused is do to lack of infrastructure and local agricultural companies , what such a thing will lead to is selling of land to foreign corporations at a more alarming rate . 
  destroying any possibility of a locally owned food production . 
  reduce poverty by taxing the majority of the population more . 
  genius !, 
  you can . 
  it has been done and worked 4 times in our history . 
  that is nowhere in scale to the 1940 pogroms in moldova . 
  and looking at that one the people basically got pissed off enough by thieves that where gypsies because one of the 4 guys murdered a romanian . 
  the police should have intervened and stopped it and settled it in court . 
  it had nothing to do with fascist propaganda it was do to poor police handling and poor education on both sides . 
  yes a hundred years ago . 
  now the far right is basically dead . 
  and banning them from speaking will just built resentment and give them a reason to actually hate . 
  are you scared of people saying that or what ? 
  if it is stupid which it is people with a brain wo n't follow it . 
  stop treating your fellow countrymen as close minded nazi 's . 
  from a legal point of view if something is legalized it 's accepted and considered normal . 
  and people will eventually take advantage of that because if you give them a finger they will take your whole hand . 
  yes but what if someone does engage in pedophilia should n't he be jailed to protect society ? 
  but by not banning it and giving the ok you are promoting it , you are normalizing it . 
  by making it legal you are literally saying that it 's normal for people to have sexual relations with animals . 
  that will lead to degeneracy . 
  that people are born that way and they ca n't help themselves . 
  is the main one iirc . 
  that is why you encourage company 's just the problem is it 's hard for the state to make sure only local companies are supported and not multinational corporations . 
  people owning land is good because it promotes independence and self sustenance . 
  which is arguably correct because the same arguments for homosexuality can and are used by people who want to legalize pedophilia . 
  remove bans on incest and zoophilia . 
  that totally wo n't end up with inbreeding , degeneracy and germany being the laughing stock of europe . 
  because we want to encourage land owning , which is a good thing . 
  for money it would make more sense to promote formation of agricultural companies and with tax and food from them the project could work and not piss of anyone . 
  remove all hate speach laws and anything similar . 
  we had enough censorship with the communists and should be fully removed . 
  where the heck would we get the money ? 
  the government barely affords milk , bread and some apples . 
  not to mention our schools lack the facilities for canteens . 
  i am not pro pnl . 
  personally i think all our political parties and nearly all our politicians are shit . 
  but even just looking at the guy it tells you that he is a spineless weasel not to mention he has a past proving it . 
  and he is also smug when he can get away with it . 
  what a spineless dog he is . 
  well vlad tepes is spinning in his grave right now . 
  we have less then 1 percent muslims and they are not in the capital . 
  the russian 4th army which is the most well equipped , largest and well trained army in the area . 
  well some of them do want to be liberated . 
  and it 's quite obvious transistria is just a russian puppet state meant to control moldova . 
  the poll does n't give the age range so for all i know they are asking grandpa to grab his pitchfork . 
  plus there are people in the diaspora that might return in case of a war . 
  roads from germany . 
  well now i know i am one of roughly 8 million people in my country that will fight for it . 
  or liberating moldova . 
  olanda ( holland ) and tarile de jos ( the low countries ) in romanian, 
  to be honest the tisa line was only of use for the army . 
  it has fertile land and a bit of industry but it ai n't much . 
  and nowadays only the crazy wanabe legionaries ever say it should be hours . 
  but that are a minority and people mostly care about moldova now . 
  the reason for them not to fully conquer hungary was in part us and their policy of nations self determination used to justify many of the new borders and not allowing hungary to exist would have been seen as hypocritical and reduce the strength of the claims for the new land . 
  as well as the risk of a new revolution which would have ruined the stability of both serbia and romania in the long run as well as having high costs . 
  what i fail to understand is why they did n't want to give romania the tisa line . 
  that was one of the promises made by the entente to romania if they where to join the war . 
  i guess it falls under the self determination doctrine in part as well as making sure no state from the little entente was so strong . 
  as to create a new empire in s e europe . 
  and i remember the 1923 date from history class . 
  the dacian crowd you can sort of excuse . 
  because we do have some dacian traditions left and bits of language and all nations search for their ancestors . 
  and they where also thought that is school . 
  but the most annoying buggers are the wanabe legionaries . 
  who think romania should start from austria and end in crimea and that all non romanians from the hungarians to the russians to the jews for some reason . 
  my knowledge on this event goes this way . 
  in 1918 after the union with transsilvania the romanian army moves to the some\u015f line where the new border was marked . 
  the hungarian army there refuses to accept that demarcation line . 
  small conflicts happen . 
  romanian army wins them and enters oradea . 
  in the meantime the hungarian guvernament resigns and the communists come into power . 
  they start pushing for a greater hungary and conflicts take place with most of hungary 's neighbours . 
  mostly skirmishes . 
  but romania send the entire army west . 
  war is eventually won by romania and the romanian army enters budapest . 
  romanian army starts taking hungarian assets as war reparations as do to the conflict they have been denied to receive war reparations from germany or the ottomans . 
  romanian army wants the new border to start from the tisa line . 
  while france uk and us pressure romania to pull back .

thank you for reminding us how beautiful and diverse europe is , we need someone to do this from time to time otherwise we would only discuss about brexit and immigrants around here, 
  gagauz are the proof that turks can into christianity / s, 
  the individual states by themselves will never reach deals as good as the ones that eu can . 
  so i guess it depends what you want fast deals or favorable deals, 
  the saying is common in romania as well, 
  was n't journalism meant to be neutral , a watch dog of the society in general ? 
  the fact that we do n't see anything wrong with a formula like `` opposition journalists '' shows that the journalism this days is nothing more than a tool used to protect different interests based on whom is paying more usually , and the sad part is that we got used with this type of `` journalism '', 
  stockholm syndrome strikes again, 
   people should be allowed to be morons , and then be judged because if it . 
  based on this logic , all the nazi symbols should be allowed too , what you are missing is that isis is attracting most of their followers by using symbols like their flag in their propaganda campaigns , people that might be inclined to follow isis will see this like a victory , another step towards a swedish caliphate giving them confidence that their views are correct and it will encourage them to follow this views further  the only thing i think will come out of this is that the people who are actually stupid enough to fly the flag will be judged as horrible people and morons ( which they are ) , lose any sort of credibility with normal society and be put on a watch list . 
  or maybe drag more support for radical views of islam , the people that would fly an isis flag do not interact with the swedish society anyway so why would you think they would even care that the swedish society will portray them as moron ? 
   and be put on a watch list that might be the only positive aspect , but most of the terrorist in france and belgium were on a watch list as well , and that did n't help, 
  very convenient , for him , 
   but mostly my grandfather would wake up and stay in line every day for us to have milk so it did n't affect me directly . 
  there was a saying in romania back then : `` the family which does n't have an old man , should buy one '' , 
   here 's the truth : the sad part came after the ceausescu fell . 
  ceau\u0219escu felt and romanians voted in power leaders from the second layer of the communist party , iliescu , roman , etc. 
  so basically the change from a quality perspective was n't happened . 
   because until then you had a society which was artificially propping up certain values , people and activities . 
  all of those fall gradually after ceausescu falls and a deep desperation of inadequacy is unveiled in the society . 
  you have to acknowledge a problem if you want to solve it , that is the first step , so in my perspective this `` unveiling '' has been a first step that we took towards becoming a better country, 
  all my comments are meant for your colleague , i have nothing with the messenger , 
  then you should know that most europeans have a different sense of humor than ours , and most of them will take post like that literally . 
  be serious , 47 % is a huge number . 
  and most of this people had lived over 30-40 years in germany, 
  haters will always hate , that is my answer to your colleague, 
  so that is why they are killing mainly iraqs and syrians in the areas that they control in order to fight a foreign occupation ? 
  / s give it up !, 
  your logic does not make any sense, 
  and what are the circumstances for which isis violence is justified in your opinion ? 
  8 % are willing to admit that violence against non-believers it is ok , this is the catch, 
  good point , i totally agree with it, 
  so there are n't any `` no go zones '' in france ? 
  ! , a lot of people were arguing about it here , i would like to ask them how would they call an area in which such events can happen ? 
  we and the polish like you , tho , 
  and i enjoy reading ignorant comments like yours . 
  romania had to join the nazi after uk and france failed to respect their obligations as main guarantors of romania 's territorial integrity . 
  we have n't joined the nazi being bound by a common political ideology but rather out of a survival instinct . 
  were the jewelries insured ? 
  hmm . . 
  7m have n't been enough it seems / s, 
  i wonder if anything will be done about crimea as a hole , from what i am reading nobody is even taking about it , is like if russia will retreat from east of ukraine than the west will lift all the sanctions and it is willing to pretend that nothing ever happened . 
  what a big surprise , not !, 
  if it helps you in any way to know , i can tell you that a lot of ees are facing the same kind of challenges as you do . 
  the main difference between immigrants like you and the ones coming from very conservative societies is the way in which each group responds to this challenges . 
  you can either try harder , which i suppose you do , use the existing prejudice as a fuel for your ambitions or live in your bubble blaming everyone and everything that is different from the things that you are used to , for all your failures . 
   possible corruption . 
  [ bbc reported ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32792314 ) last year that illegal logging has inflicted losses of at least $ 5bn ( # 3.6 bn ; $ 5.7 bn ) on romania since the communist regime was toppled in 1989 and that romanians were protesting about it . 
  deforestation has reduced romania 's forest cover to about 26 % of the total land area , he said , `` but scientists say 36 % should be the minimum '' . 
  this kind of problems have as main reasons corruption and a weak rule of law , who actually owns the forests has much less impact than the motives stated above  as to foreign ownership of forests or agricultural land , again it can be an identity issue as land is central to a group 's identity , it could be a national security issue re food security or simply exploitation of a poorer country 's primary resources . 
  all this concerns are real and exist , but all of them can be addressed by a strong and well implemented legislation , romania could for example impose quotas on how much wood can be exploited , how much wood can be exported , tougher actions against illegal logging , and so on  its also possibly illegal in those countries . 
  and oak takes ages to grow , it 's a multigenerational investment . 
  it is n't illegal as it was one of the preconditions that we had to agree on in order to be part of the eu . 
  could we please start ignoring this guy ? 
  ! , he is irrelevant , besides being corrupt and a hypocrit . 
  what 's the issue here ? , i do n't care who owns the land in romania , as long as they are using it in the economic interest of the country . 
  as a matter of fact romania had a couple of leaders , and business owners of foreign origins which had been more patriotic and dedicated to the prosperity of romania than a lot of romanian leaders are right now . 
  i wish you good luck , dear fins !, 
  it is only me that thinks that this kind of demands have rather more a political goal than religious importance ? 
  i mean even in coran it is being written that muslim are allowed to respect the customs of the place were they are living if that area/country is not a muslim one . 
  drama queens !, 
   they even made the sky bluer !, 
  damn these rumanians , when they get to work there 's no stopping them . 
  this might be more true than you might think , as eu regulation required that romania had to move its heavy industry outside of the cities , so as a result you get a cleaner environment and blue skies  on the other hand some of the factories went bankrupt , not being able to compete with their western counterparts after romania opened up its domestic market, 
  i think the brits were more worried by the immigration policies that countries like norway , sweden or germany have regarding immigrants/refugees , than the ee migrants . 
  and turkey gave us ethnic romanians , from where ? 
  thanks for the advice , i am very relaxed . 
  http://www.wsj.com/articles/turkeys-kurdish-cities-become-war-zones-1450898252 http://mobile.reuters.com/article/iduskcn0wh0iw http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/magazine/behind-the-barricades-of-turkeys-hidden-war.html, 
  `` cleaning operations '' with tanks and helicopters into cities , ya right, 
  western media is far from being free and democratic but is far better than the turkish media which is basically the propaganda arm of the turkish government, 
  just a few : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tosgw2hzehq https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k4kidokk9om https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7uxmsijg8rc ps : you can downvote me as much as you want , time will show who is right, 
  for me this does n't adds up : 1 . 
  first those police officers were killed after a bomb killed a couple of dozens of kurds that were demonstrating in support of the kurds in kobani , some sources say that they were ready to cross the border even and support the kurds in kobani . 
  i know that the turkish government blame isis for the attack but pkk blame the turkey for the attack and they retaliated by killing the two police officers 2 . 
  if two police officers are killed you do n't start a civil war in which probability until now hundreds had died already , you try to isolated the incident to contain the hole situation, 
   yeah , another one is , guess what ? 
  syria , rumors assad regime has bought oil from isis are , at the very least , [ far more founded ] ( http://uk.businessinsider.com/assad-oil-isis-2016-4?r=us&amp;ir=t ) let 's wait a bit , i am sure that all the turkish official sacked during the last months will start speaking very soon , and they will bring even more solid profs then the ones that already exist . 
  on the other hand for the syrian regime to buy oil from its enemy does n't make any sense to me . 
  besides plenty of youtube clips that can be found online supporting this theory , let 's just use the logic : isis was making most of its revenue from oil , the main consumer of oil in the region which does n't has its own oil resources it is turkey edit : grammar, 
  the reason for which turkey broke the truce with pkk is hilarious to say the least , turkey basically made up a reason to resume the fight against pkk, 
  if turkey would had really want to fight against isis it would n't have bought any oil from them , and it would have defended kobani when they had the chance to do it , by entering into the ground war in syria much earlier . 
  their main target are the kurds everyone knows that . 
  edit : grammar, 
  what makes things even worse is that the dogs are haram / s, 
  the first union between wallachia and moldova in 1859 happen without the consent of the great powers , so i guess from that perspective we are on a good track . 
  nevertheless a solution similar with the german austrian solution , or any other solution that would transform r. of moldova in a stable and prosperous country will be seen as a positive result as well . 
  now only the middle eastern origin part has to be proven . 
  hint : drinking habits will not help you this time , 
  i do n't speak french , tho / s, 
  i think when people complain about ees or mes they do not complain about their genetical heritage , they complain about their culture and their habits, 
  you could subsidize a lot of green energy projects with 13bn euros , tho, 
  volkswagen 's paycheck to us  . 
  this kind of laws and regulations have much more to do with the competition that sites like airbnb pose towards the traditional accommodation business then it has to do with anything else . 
  chances are that the hotel industry are better on lobbying on keeping their advantages then airbnb is . 
  when i spoke about a colonial museum i meant a museum that will present also what the dutch rule meant for the countries and ethnic groups that they rule upon , and not just a museum that will present a bunch of items looted or bought by the dutch from their colonies . 
  the colonial dutch past might have meant for the dutch their golden age , but had you even wonder how are those times remembered and perceived by the countries that they ruled upon ? 
  what about the slave trade that dutch did , any word about it anywhere in the public dutch space , or in the current dutch society ? 
  there is only one monument about it in [ oosterpark ] ( http://www.whatsupwithamsterdam.com/slavery-in-amsterdam/ ) , which i bet is not as promoted as anne frank museum is . 
  i always have been fascinated by the fact that the dutch have an `` ane frank '' museum but no slavery museum or a museum dedicated to the colonial dutch past . 
  i mean it looks like they are good pointing fingers without looking themselves first in the mirror .

   i want you fucking toothpastes to give pic related a good deep look .

  if everyone start picking and choosing , then it 's gone . 
  everyone did what was best for them , to the detriment of the whole . 
  this is the difference between the `` social optimum '' vs `` nash equilibrium '' mentality . 
  where the `` social optimum '' gives the best general outcome but requires everyone to not try to undermine the system , while the `` nash equilibrium '' is inferior but is what happens after a series of defections reaches a point where actors can no longer gain an advantage . 
  i 'm pro-ftt , and other ` own resource ' schemes . 
  so i want less state contributions in proportion to eu rates and taxes . 
  so , i guess , no one . 
  of course . 
  the total of all net contributions has to be zero . 
  if you remove top net contributors then the total value of the rest is always bellow zero , because math . 
  uk contributes more than zero , so it will be bigger than the rest of the contributions of everyone else , and especially of everyone below it . 
  now what 's the price of tea in china ? 
  everyone being equal in front of the law , and free from discrimination is now `` ideological purity '' ? 
  `` adjustment '' has to both benefit and apply to everyone . 
  no one should ever be above a common rule set . 
  and , that being said , freedom of employment has been the one thing that has prevented the nightmare of being turned into an outsourcing colony for wealthy countries to happen , something eastern europe suspected would be the case . 
  to undermine that , undermines a keystone of why e.e choose to lower its trade barriers and own native protections . 
  the treaties , in short , exist for a reason . 
  when equality under law and treaties can be waved away with `` times change '' , then civilization has failed . 
  and they can , they just have to leave the eu . 
  there 's a bunch of politicians in romania with an entire spiel about `` stopping foreign ownership of the country '' that have been held back by eu anti-discrimination laws , you can make their day in a few easy steps . 
  no , went straight from the beginning . 
   it strikes me that all the uk hating that goes on in some quarters only really validates that the eu have had it in for the uk all along , it 's self-interest , no hate involved , nothing personal . 
  same as the policy of the uk with scotland , no sharing of the currency , no promise of soft borders , no pre-negotiation . 
  this is no different . 
  it 's geopolitics , not a family drama . 
  holy shit , did n't even realize it until you mentioned it , that is neat !,

  do n't put everything just on merkel . 
  the entire epp party group colluded with her and her cabinet to steer europe into economic and political stagnation , for the sake of their own power . 
   europe , or should i say the individual countries that make up europe , are independent . 
  as someone who 's lived a good part of his life getting to grips with nato , the wto , the imf and how it linked us in to american foreign policy : no , we 're not . 
  we just have an easy time pretending we are . 
   you 're talking such bollocks . 
  i 'm just saying what the uk media said . 
  how am i responsible if it 's all bollocks , it 's your media ?

  did n't he also originally plan to stay just five years , then head to canada to run for office ? 
  what do you think made him change his mind on all of this ? 
  no one said that here , mark carney is n't exactly a european figure . 
  you might have us confused with one of the uk subreddits which cares about what mark carney or figures like nick clegg say . 
  but now that we 're on the topic . 
  the man was being pushed to be fired by brexiter politicians in october , was defending his views in november , was thinking of going back to canada by the end of december , and now it 's january , he 's still here , and look how nice he 's playing with everyone else . 
  but do n't think i 'm arguing this should stop anyone from their current trajectory . 
  i do n't want to change any minds . 
  here 's looking forward to march . 
  exactly , which is why the eu should implement the system as well . 
  in reverse . 
  the uk should pay the eu , every time they issue a visa to someone like a medical professional . 
  do n't see why not , we educated them , it 's only fair . 
  the priority of the boe is to secure the economic well-being of the uk , not to be honest . 
  mark carney has been accused of `` lack of optimism '' before , relating to brexit . 
  in case you have n't notice , quite a few people have lost their jobs over that . 
  maybe he 's found some , after a quick visit to no 10 about how `` central bank independence '' is going to look like in the future . 
  i actually begrudge it , a lot . 
  if what matter when making policy is influence , than the powerful arrange things to keep themselves powerful . 
  if we can minimize influence in policy , in favour of law and argumentation , then we should . 
  i agree with everything else , and maybe it 's time we resurrect the ftt . 
  the current setup biases the system towards big payers like germany . 
  it 's in everyone 's interest that this stops . 
  i know , right !, 
  and he actually stood on his own , did n't come off as a complete idiot , and good on him despite my complete disagreement with his position . 
  but him vacillating over `` what is the eu doing well '' question , and then a minute later talking about how romania should be in schengen is priceless . 
  typical `` i want more power to states , except when it hurts my state '' mentality . 
  wow , the two main candidates are horrible . 
  even the enf candidate is actually coming out looking better by simply being able to hold a platform he can clearly enunciate . 
  edit : my 2 cent wrap up : i liked it . 
  ryan heath is cheeky as hell when he wants to be . 
  translation should be done better . 
  when it comes to surprising , jean lambert ( uk , greens ) and helga stevens ( nl , ecr ) are candidates that hook you in , make good points , and gave a strong showing . 
  laurentiu rebega ( ro , enf ) is not far off , managing to come off as more than a throw away candidate . 
  verhofstadt is verhofsdat , and that 's either brilliant or terrible , but never at a loss for words , and a personal favorite . 
  pittella ( it , s&d ) wants really hard to differentiate himself from the center-right , and keeps coming up short . 
  tajani ( it , epp ) wins the dubious honour of talking the most and saying the least . 
  bright spot : if he wins , you might never hear from him again . 
  eleonora forenza ( it , gue/ngl ) has three talking points : everything is terrible , i am a feminist , i am young . 
  but did he have a divine nature and a human nature , a half divine half human nature , or a divine and human nature ? 
  religion : asking all the important questions . 
  good on politico for arranging it . 
  i have my misgivings about them , but they do put in the work to make things happen . 
  now let 's see who 's trying to replace schulz . 
  edit : and drama already with the appearance of a last-minute candidate for le pen 's enf , laurentiu rebega .

  different areas in a council have different collection days . 
  you have to check the council website for your street . 
  interesting side note on cultural differences in dealing with garbage . 
  due to a lack of garbage bins in public areas , and a prevalence of porters , people just leave their garbage lieing around for `` the man to pick up '' . 
  this does not combine well with weather that tends to the windy and a prevalence of seagulls . 
  and it 's a pain , when you 're the sort of person that ca n't bring himself to litter . 
  maybe something else to add to the `` cultural adjustment list '' . 
  the market adjust it to different values , it 's been the norm for me , i ca n't tell you why with solidity . 
  i suspect a lack of standardization and consistency , creates lack of trust outside scotland , so exchange offices do n't give them out to local customers and instead have to ship them back to the uk or sell them to someone else that can which increases their price . 
  you can say they are `` legally '' the same note . 
  but not only is that actually a crapshot argument in the weird and multiple legal jurisdictions of the uk ( i 've heard yes and no arguments ) , but they have always been managed very differently , and only recently have the regional notes been brought into line to be more consistently managed by the boe after rbs nearly went under . 
   they look different . 
  they are the same currency . 
  just like a german $ 2 is the same as an irish $ 2 . 
  it really is n't , talking as someone who 's been repeatedly caught with clydesdale notes overseas .

  people have favorite topics , what 's wrong with that ? 
  if they spread blatant lies or harass others with their own opinions continuously ... well , that 's another thing entirely . 
  man , stop over-judging things .

  so , instead of focusing on correcting the effect , the parents should focus on correcting the cause . 
   this was the only solution neah , that 's what you think or what your parents told you . 
  there are always better solutions . 
  then how about raiding villages from africa , get the babies , leave some money and a thank you note , and give them a proper life here ? 
   we can decrease financing of education if we want cheap solution . 
  how about giving incentives ? 
  more paid vacation , more money per children , less tax , etc. 
  but why blame it all on europe ? 
  it was n't all rainbows and unicorns here in europe as well , you know . 
  the shit this continent has seen ... i know it 's hard to rise from poverty , but pointing fingers ai n't helping much .

  they should n't push us too far or we 'll go full ceausescu on them .

  the soviets did n't had the bomb until 1949 , plenty of time for the americans to drop a few and force them to surrender . 
  no wwiii .

  lol , what ? 
  in what parallel universe do you live that you believe that it was heaven on earth in romania under the fascist rule ? 
   again , why did people wait for the americans ? 
  it was russia they sided with and russia is what they got . 
  what was the problem ? 
  we did n't had an option , man . 
  it was either side with the russians or be raped heavily in the ass and then side with the russians . 
  yes , but it had its history tied up with renault even from its communist beginnings . 
  and now they are fully renault-owned and , without them , dacia would have , most likely , crumbled to dust as most of our state-owned enterprises did . 
   did people really expect america to be able to liberate all of europe ? 
  well ... yes !, 
  think about it , if they took on the soviets then , when they had the nuclear power while they did n't , there would n't had been no cold war and no lots of former warsaw pact countries suffering communist idiocy . 
  this will help : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vin_americanii !, 
  thanks france !, 
  for carrefour and dacia . 
  the amount of beggars we `` export '' is insignificant and , in general , they do not send money back here . 
  we do sent , however , a lot of qualified work force ( which is a lot more than the beggars ) . 
  they are the ones which send back money to their families here and helped us got through the economic crisis . 
  anyway , to answer your question , this growth is not fueled by our emigrants but mostly by increased consumption with bits of increased industry output and recent crackdown on fraud and corruption . 
  yes , please welcome to romania , we have ... uhmmm ... we can give you ... aaaa ... , you can just take these ... err ... on second though , here is a map to scandinavia . 
  best of luck !, 
  uhmmm ... is n't germany in central europe ? 
   far right europe what could go wrong , right ? 
  i think that us , eastern europeans are a little too much butthurt when negative aspects of our societies are presented . 
  we need to acknowledge and fix them , not taking the defensive positions each time with : `` yes , but we are not all like that , yes but `` ze communists fucked us good '' , yes but look we have this one guy who is extraordinary , etc. 
  yay , someone wants us !, 
  second place , but still ... 
   after the migrants had been transferred , a speedboat approached and its crew fired several shots into the air before the assailants sped away with the empty migrant boat , frontex said .

  guys , i think the chief prosecutor is the re-incarnation of vlad the impaler : `` romanian and bulgarian documents from 1481 onwards portray vlad as a hero , a true leader , who used harsh yet fair methods to reclaim the country from the corrupt and rich boyars '', 
   reality chooses my emotions , i do n't .

as far as i remember there was a stamp and a signature on the one i filled . 
  i could be wrong though , i was in a bit of a hurry . 
  also a lot of commotion related to an additional declaration that people voting outside of their circumscription need to sign before being allowed to vote . 
  in some of the voting sections in the capital , these papers ( that need to be official for some reason ) have been depleted and nothing seems to be done about it . 
  i had to try in 4 different election offices before finding one where i could vote . 
  i do n't even realize if it 's incompetence or plain fraud . 
  are you trying to be ironic ? 
  bwahahah , i think the brits would be twice as upset if they 'd know that romanians instead of taking their jobs are taking their unemployment benefits .

  let 's not forget that meego can run anything that can be ported to an arm linux kernel . 
  this is one of the main reasons that ( in my opinion ) make plain linux mobile oses better than the competition . 
  hmmm , let 's agree to disagree then . 
   [ edit ] it 's amazing to me that the statement i commented on is on + karma without providing _ any _ support or explanation , and i 'm getting downvoted without the courtesy of a comment . 
   so : meego rulz , retardroid sux !, 
  ! 1one peace out !, 
  nokia already had a very good smart phone os available and developed inhouse : meego . 
   but where nokia never caught up is in software . 
  actually meego os was ( is ) one of the best phone oses to date . 
  the fact that they failed to promote it , fired most of the people working on it , and went the windows mobile way is one of the main reasons they failed into irrelevance . 
  maybe it was too little too late , but i think it would have turned things around for them . 
  ( see how hyped sailfish os and jolla are ), 
  the two do n't exclude each other . 
  too bad they 're still shit : there are separator pylons between the two bike lanes , which are a serious hazard , the divider between the actual road and the bike lane is almost 30cm in height ( twice as high as the regular curb ) and presents a danger to cyclists and to motorists . 
  not to mention that it 's not yet finished and as such there are no bicycle traffic lights ( i 've seen at least 10 cyclists disregard intersections and pedestrian crossings because of this , one almost getting clipped by a trolley ) . 
  the surface is uneven even with sewer man holes raised here and there . 
  all in all , this particular bike lane is a fucking joke and i , as a cyclist will change my route to avoid it . 
  be careful , he marked you to steal your wallet . 
  to be honest , i 'm not 100 % sure what i 'm reading from the site ... 
  i just translated what 's there . 
  there are three groups and maybe i conflated them poorly , vat and profit tax are under goods and services , for example . 
  in this case i 'm not sure how to read the graph , sorry . 
  about 45 % , of which [ 1 ] : * 20 % social security * 16 % profit tax * 24 % vat * 16 % income tax * 13 % health insurance ( split in two funds as far as i 've seen ) * other minor stuff ... [ 1 ] data taken from [ open budget ] ( http://openbudget.ro/ ), 
  last time i checked their line-up , there really were n't any big names i really wanted to see that i have n't seen before . 
  the only things that might interest me are the world music and irish & blues stages . 
  i have n't decided if that 's enough . 
  on the other hand , like all the big festivals it 's the perfect hippie commune : drugs , booze , sex , loudness are all around you and might overwhelm you sometimes . 
  hmm ... now that i think about it , it might be a good idea to go ... 
  well , there was also ( the sc2 final happens as i write this ) the [ dreamhack bucharest ] ( http://dreamhack.ro ) lan party . 
  i 'm under the impression that the parent poster was n't exactly thinking about nato when he said `` us '' . 
  i agree ... 
  well , you still have `` snailing '' ... that 'd be pretty awkward in english . 
  i think it 's weird that when you say war with russia , in your mind you see `` usa vs. russia '' . 
  i think it speaks a bit about the hypocrisy of some europeans that complain about us interventionist policies , but when things are getting difficult that 's where they see the solution coming from .

   the protests were agains the whole political class , practically against both the prime minister and the president ... do you have a source for that ? 
  i did n't hear anything about the president so far . 
  maybe i 'm subscribed to the wrong blogs . 
  it 's not a protest against government , afaik it 's a protest against the prime minister and a bunch of laws that would essentially let free all the corrupt politicians condemned in the last couple of years . 
  i did n't mean it as i `` have faith '' that my mep will do the thing i consider correct , but i meant it as `` voted for this mep , because her views are compatible to mine and i trust her to make an informed decision '' . 
  ( dunno if this makes me less na\u00efve in your eyes , but for me it 's enough ), 
  to be honest , i trust my mep to do the right thing .

   the tractor and trailer that picks up the trash every thursday really does throw everything in a big pile . 
  that 's because at the recycling plant they do another triage . 
  people ca n't be really trusted to split them correctly . 
  :d let me guess , the village is somewhere in the west part of romania ? 
  we 're really behind in regards to the infrastructure needed for recycling . 
  just in the capital and few of the big cities there are bins for plastic-metal , paper and glass collecting . 
  and generally , the people disregard them because `` they always gather the contents with the same car '' ... another point is that there are no campaigns for bringing this issue into public attention . 
  god damn ` it ... you stole my line ... 
  good encryption is done between the ends of the communication using pairs of public/private encryption keys . 
  so , theoretically you do n't need the support of your service providers , but the one of your interlocutor . 
  most of the open-source im clients have support for the otr encryption plugin - which encrypts the conversations on top of the communication protocol . 
  so the problem is now , how to convince my 100 luddite friends on the benefits of encryption and maintaining a web of trust . 
   who looks quite normal bwahahahah , are n't you a closet racist .

  ca n't wait for that company to claim that that 's how czechs want their fish fingers , with less meat , local tastes you know ... 
  who cares what a nazi says ? 
  that 's the thing . 
  because of improper labeling they made people eat horsemeat even if they would n't do that . 
  this was the problem few years ago with a similar scandal also , not because people got sick or something else .

  totaly imported . 
   terror attacks i agree with undermining civil rights . 
  some conspiracy nutjobs might see it as the end goal of this `` refugees '' shitstorm ( and overall irresponsible immigration policies ) . 
  and when you see the effects of decades of such policies becomes harder and harder to contradict them . 
  on the other hand when you hear that some lives could have been saved if only one radicalized man known to the police that is a ticking bomb could have been handled if some laws would be different . 
  not to mention that the number of such suspects makes tracking all of them 24/7 an impossible task . 
   acid attacks are not limited to refugees . 
  are n't this kind of attacks also `` imported '' ? 
  along with pakistanis ( mostly ) . 
   the treatment of women improves with time . 
  no it wont if you keep importing people with this backward view regarding gender roles in society . 
   immigrants in prison probably have to do with the failure of european domestic policies more than anything .

  when you see all these problems , some unique to this immigrants demographics , you must wonder if all this is worth it . 
   countries like canada handle immigration very well , yes they do . 
  because they select who steps foot on their soil . 
  we were n't able to do that properly even for legal immigration that happened decades ago ( in france and i would say even germany , although their situation is better ) . 
  i 'm sure you realize that will be much worse with illegal , unselected immigration from subsaharian shitholes . 
   it was created to do both eu 's main responsability is towards its citizens . 
  there are optional bonuses that are nice , but not when it contradicts its `` law 0 '' ( asimov 's robotics laws reference ) . 
  edit : format, 
  i do n't have a problem with the 35 mil if this is what you think . 
  i would n't mind even 1 billion to help italian government manage `` refugees '' that are already here . 
  i have a problem with `` defer the italian government from the idea of closing ports for ships with refugees and migrants . '', 
  yeah . 
  and in 2-3 generations ee will be squeezed between nuclear western caliphate and nuclear russian empire . 
   well , that 's what you claim with good arguments . 
  fgm , acid attacks , terror attacks , how women are treated , higher criminal activity in general ( hugely over-represented in prison populations ) . 
  should i go on ? 
   then i say it 's a divine punishment . 
  frankly , at that point i 'd say that i 'm done with europe . 
  yeah because eu was created to help migrants from 3rd world and not improve life for its citizens . 
  right ? 
   can you post any reliable sources to corrobrate this ? 
  in this way , the ec wants to defer the italian government from the idea of closing ports for ships with refugees and migrants . 
   italy is to receive additional $ 35 million from the european commission for the management of migration . 
  in this way , the ec wants to defer the italian government from the idea of closing ports for ships with refugees and migrants . 
  wtf ? 
  so eu is not so powerless anymore . 
  looks like they actively encourage illegal immigration . 
  unfuckingbelievable, 
  what kind of year ? 
  nautical year , london year , astronomical year ... ? 
  you could go a little further back and add to the list the first military incursion of modern russia ( i think ) . 
  would n't it be an empire if it asked . 
   genuine traditional [ random german region goes here ] as long as someone else does quality tests . 
  vw is also traditional . 
   where the migrant boats send out their sos calls it would be a shame if some european ships would suddleny make fake sos calls to fuck with ngo 's operations . 
   sovjet union could have been dissoluted better it certainly was n't perfect ( quite bad from economic pov ) . 
  but in its defense this dissolution has one great quality : no wars . 
   it 's not like the ussr was on it 's own there . 
  yeah and romania 's fear of being invaded by ussr because it did n't participate in that invasion was just in its imagination right ? 
  so does this mean that hungary will take some refugees from turkey to ease pressure there ? 
  unfortunately for orban [ trump 's heart is taken ] ( https://pics.me.me/i-wish-one-day-someone-will-look-at-me-the-22520613.png ), 
   at its worst,

   who ? 
  who is saying that ? 
  one guy that annoyed you on / r/europe ? 
  have actually lived there . 
  that 's all i 'm going to say , not interested in being insulted and called bigoted for stating an observation . 
  call it a `` communication barrier '' on my part . 
  nationalism in europe has two paths : nation building and state building . 
  british and french nationalism was very much about nation building around the state . 
  german and most eastern nationalism was state building around a perceived nation . 
  italian nationalism did both in equal measure . 
  but to the monarchists it was all dangerous , because they were conservative at heart . 
  people like bismark were unique in seeing an opportunity in riding the wave . 
  you 're attributing malice to what is simply poor thinking . 
  no one set out to `` replace people with foreigners '' . 
  people just believe that when given the opportunity , everyone will accept to work together instead of being shit to each other . 
  in a better world , they would be right . 
  but this is n't a better world , which is why our entire european society is very keen on secularism and polite `` avoid religion and politics at the table . '' . 
  the left simply forgot how to manage these sorts of conflicts after having an easy time post-ww2 , having inherited the victories of their grandparents . 
  if we looks at ataturk , he gave a good example at how it 's always been done , and should be done : you set up rules everyone follows equally . 
  and you try to not show preferential treatment . 
   hey , since blue collar millionaire billionaire is now a thing . 
  and nigel `` commodity trader turned professional politician '' farage is seen as a man of the people ... 
  it 's really hard to comprehend how easy it is to get your `` blue collar '' credentials these days . 
  you might as well say that 's what happens when any 2 people have to deal with each other . 
  civilization is and has always been about keeping people 's individuals quirks to themselves , and keeping society working . 
  call it culture , religion , legalistic belief , tribal affiliation , or family rivalry . 
  there 's never been any shortage of belligerent numb-skullery when it comes to people . 
  but we keep making progress . 
  not even the eton-group , actually eton . 
  he grew up in new york , and not even `` almost new jersey '' new york , but the heart of manhattan . 
  he is a oxford classics student , with a bullington club membership . 
  he is a walking tory standard resume template . 
  as common as a high-end rolex watch . 
  are you seriously going to try and paint boris johnson as `` low born '' ? 
  do you enjoy the challenge ? 
  and then calling mr. `` private garden bridge '' a populist , which is just splendid . 
  i do n't think you actually know much of mr. johnson . 
  he 's well educated , and speaks with a posh accent . 
  but there 's a reason he 's had constant problems getting inside the tory inner circle , no one trusts him to do his job . 
  some would say he 's a classic example of being educated above one 's intelligence . 
  you do n't mention the severe differences between state and `` public '' schooling , as well as the regional lottery . 
  you could have been taught that , but for most people there 's a giant blind spot between the tudors and ww 1 . 
  you missed a rather endemic behavior : the british way is always superior , and they 'll tell you why . 
  the plugs , the taps , the lack of insulation , the transport , the lack of id , the parliamentary system , everything . 
  if it ca n't be rationalized , then the hardship involved in dealing with it will be interpreted as a form of character-building show of resilience . 
  the house is leaking heat like a sieve ? 
  put on a sweater and make some tea , it 's the british way . 
  the culture of complaint and self-deprecation is actually carefully stage-managed bit of well-worn `` safe topics '' . 
  if you get too damn close to the mark , you 're not going to have a good time . 
   and here we see the brit and his habit of ` saying less ' than what he means . 
  that 's honestly a bit of a cultural affectation put on for show . 
  modern britain is n't like that . 
  if you have n't had the pleasure of seeing `` bant '' , the gist is that outright insults are confused for jokes or a form of honesty . 
  everyone wants to be malcom tucker . 
   reminds me of the irony of idiots like farage calling brexit ` independence day ' and then he followed it up claiming it was achieved `` without a single bullet being fired '' . 
   since when are multicultural societies a fundamental value of europe ? 
  notice how the catholics and protestant are not killing each other anymore . 
  how tyrol and sz\u00e9kely land are not warzones . 
  how political parties do n't bomb each other in the streets . 
  yeah , you 're welcome . 
  not only that but apparently norway has significant internal linguistic divisions . 
  it seems , it 's best to think of the whole of germanic scandinavia as a collection of dialects , some of which have states attached . 
  there clearly is no german demos . 
  they ca n't even agree what to call meatballs . 
  this failed pan-germanic experiment should be ended and the german states given back their freedom . 
  ohh , merci beaucoup !, 
  i never could remember what this was until now . 
  it 's actually quite hard to find something . 
  [ here 's a bit relating to the singapore deal ] ( http://eulawradar.com/case-a-215-the-eu-singapore-free-trade-agreement-a-mixed-agreement/ ) . 
  the short of it is that there is a difference between a simple fta , and a more comprehensive ` mixed agreement ' but no clear rule what differentiates the two . 
  so any trade agreement can fall into either category depending on council or court decision . 
  [ here 's an article about the negotiations around how to classify ceta ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/walloon-rebellion-threatens-commissions-trade-powers/ ) the title is misleading since the eu did n't actually throw away it 's right , the council decided it wanted to intergovermentalize the agreement to win eurosceptic points and did a eurozone/schengen aka fucked up . 
  the article tries to paint it as a commission problem , but it 's pretty clear reading it how it went . 
  the issue is that nato is an alliance system . 
  and in europe we have a ton of experience with alliance systems , they do n't really work . 
  they either break down , end up fighting internally , are too disorganized to pose a cohesive threat , or turn into hegemonies . 
  so nato is to a war machine , what a pile of bricks is to a house . 
  and the fact that europe will be the battleground , only makes this mess all the more worrying . 
  it was n't the churches where knowledge was kept . 
  it was the monasteries , where they sent the priests that could n't play the internal politics well . 
  and that `` shared identity '' pretty much consisted of constant war as the church declared anyone it did n't like either a heretic or excommunicated . 
  they actually assisted in the destruction of the last remnant of rome , and then kept the italian peninsula in a constant state of warfare for their own benefit . 
  luther was probably the best thing to happen to the continent , despite the puritanical beginnings , simply for breaking it 's stranglehold on the continent . 
  and the amount of stuff we had to outright steal from the arabic scholars to kick start the renaissance is embarrassing , and a testament to how completely the church crippled us . 
  you 're perfectly right to point out the diversity of character in the roman state . 
  but in the end , those ideals and those men where used up by people who 's interest were solely to enrich themselves . 
  the roman oligarchs monopolized power , land , and wealth without restriction forcing constant expansion as a pressure valve for the frustration of the people they were stealing from . 
  they bought the land of soldiers who were kept away from home , they used slaves instead of free men , they killed anyone who complained too much . 
  empire is just that . 
  a system that co-opts people into its service , good or evil . 
  and while they could have convinced themselves they were justified , we have the hindsight to see a constant race to escape the inevitable logic of a set of short-sighted choices and ambitions that inevitably lead to autocracy . 
  more land to make up for what was stolen , more slaves to work it , more spoils to keep the plebs happy , more wars so minor houses can compete with major ones , and more compromises as the entire system unwound . 
  rome as a culture and state is a truly magnificent thing in many ways . 
  but it also suffered from can only be called a form of political parasitism that forced it into an expansionary phase it could have never survived intact . 
  except the exact issue is that there is no `` we '' right now , thanks to the `` i 've got mine '' sovereigntists . 
  so there 's a very real danger that the nuclear powers , us , uk and france , might not be that hasty about what happens somewhere in poland . 
  and that 's why we should unite . 
   their ability make a lot allies also gave them a lot of enemies . 
  as the achaean league learned , being anything less than an ally also made you an enemy . 
   2nd punic was more or less started by carthage .

  as a sidenote most of the people i know who left for spain have a lower level of education and work in construction mostly . 
  all of my relatives/friends who left for uk/de/nl / be/se/fr have high education and work in offices and are well mannered and well integrated . 
  but guess which one of them have to listen to questions like : is there a lot of starving in romania ? 
  are there restaurants in romania ? 
  do people have fridge back in your home ? 
  how is that you are not dark colored ? 
  i will tell you , not the ones from spain ( ok , to be fair the two people i talked to from sweden had nothing to complain either ) . 
  spanish people have a very `` let it be '' attitude and i really appreciate that , it is the last sane corner of europe . 
  well , i wrote a lot and just partially addressed your ( rightful ) concerns , sorry for that . 
  i have a few travel websites and i get sometimes emails regarding safety and rape in special in germany ... like ... how likely is that i will be raped in rothenburg ob der tauber if i go there in october ? 
  how many refugees are in the city ? 
  i simply replied that rape is a fact of life now , you have to accept it while visiting rothenburg , i myself was raped in the butthole while grocery shopping . 
  did not hear back from her ( she was from tn , usa ) . 
  i would so much love to ship the alt-righters and meet the vast majority of these refugees and talk to them . 
  but i think nothing would change their pre-existing worldview . 
  on another note , i think the term `` refugee crisis '' is right as logistically and politically it was an immense job to find so many people a place to stay , the social services must be overwhelmed . 
  politically it was also a crisis as there were people who took it as a `` free ticket to eu '' and jumped the bandwagon although their situation would n't justify them a refugee status . 
  very proud of barcelona and spain too !, 
  however self-loathing spaniards are , i always say they are some of the most welcoming people in europe if you are a minority . 
  sweden recently passed the 10 million population mark !, 
  for more facts about sweden , please subscribe to sweden facts !, 
  yes , it is sad when people believe headlines and form their opinions about whole countries/cultures based on extraordinary news . 
  i often find on reddit people asking whether it is safe to visit paris/what are the chances of them getting raped ... and that makes me very sad . 
  on the other hand issues must be acknowledged and addressed ( and there are some ) . 
  until late i thought it would be only people outside europe thinking like this but last year someone in my extended family refused to go to paris because the airports there must be unsafe ( while in fact the roads in romania are much unsafer places ) . 
  but then i get questioned whether fridges exist in romanian households and i realize it is the ignorance combined with fear that is the most detrimental . 
  sweden has a high birth rate , one of the highest in the eu ( and that is not only attributed to immigrants , in fact it is attributed to the safety net sweden provides ) . 
  most immigrants are well integrated in the society , crime rate is n't up however you count the statistics . 
  but of course anything that does not subscribe to your world view is a cold-faced lie . 
  you live in your bubble . 
  and no , i am not a yippie yuppie liberal , i will acknowledge there are plenty of integration issues in western europe in general and most likely in sweden in particular as well . 
  and the public discourse is too pc too . 
  but you are delusional if you think sweden is not just as awesome as ever . 
  in fact it is more awesome than ever . 
  i agree . 
  but it is more to do with this line of thinking le pen - no no . 
  no , really , it is a clear no . 
  enough said fillon - pro russia , has a big scandal tied to its name and is the most likely to lose against le pen in the second round . 
  macron is none of the above two , at least no scandal reached the international media . 
  very few people know anything about melenchon and hamon to be honest as they are the 4th and 5th in the polls and there is just so much attention an average person gives to politics in another country . 
  hell , if you would ask who the french president is in romania or hungary i bet more than 50 % of the population could n't name hollande . 
  i often amuse myself at people outside of eu asking whether it is safe right now to walk in `` europe '' like it would be a cesspool of crime and terrorism while it is the safest continent by far . 
  same with sweden . 
  it was often portrayed as the liberal model and it is under constant attack from the alt-right . 
  however , there are issues in sweden and they need to be addressed , mocking the alt-right who exaggerates the issues is not enough ( although i love to do that ) . 
   btw , this is the same communication strategy russia ( and it 's trolls ) are using . 
  they say you ca n't prove something , thus it must be wrong . 
  to further add to this tactic , i recommend to read about this strategy : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism nowadays i see it more and more , used in all spheres . 
  this answer is ... 
  i do n't know , i voted for you in the lack of a better alternative , but you have to figure this one out for yourself or you will become irrelevant as soon as you say `` ideology '', 
  internet hugs to you !, 
  it is important to emphasize what you did !, 
  however i feel some people have their head too deep in their own bubble to accept facts, 
  to me , it seems someone else likes that, 
  those are some very beautiful kettles !,

  '' \u0160uto orizari in romania is the largest roma settlement in the world . '', 
  what ? 
  anyway , the article is a good read although biased , but it is an opinion piece about a book so that is fine . 
  clearly the issue is ignored and i think it is a very good observation that people can do anything to the roma as they have no agency to do anything against it . 
  every other minority ( being it ethic or sexual ) is better organized and can address its issues , but the roma are divided and politically they will not vote to the party that supports their issues ( if there would be any ) but to the one that gives them very tangible and very short term benefits .

  ermellek is a lot like the puszta in eastern hungary but with wine . 
  if you would have asked me how that wine tastes like one month ago i would have said `` horrible '' . 
  but on christmas i got to taste a wine from diosig and ... omg ... it was very good . 
  i drank hundreds of wines from dozens of countries and that wine i think was the second best ever . 
  so the climate/know-how is there . 
  unfortunately if you say diosig region or northern bihor region no one knows anything about the wines . 
  they lack marketing . 
  oh , and one liter of that wine was 15 or 17 lei ( less than 4 euros ) . 
  yes , suicide is dark and i know it very well . 
  imagine my family is from that village ( hence i know the stories ) and one uncle and a cousin also committed suicide . 
  glad you liked the pictures . 
  it is a beautiful place overall for those who love nature , organic food and a relaxed pace of life but it is not dynamic at all and infrastructure lacks as well . 
  i enjoyed all the series from italy hence i thought of doing one for romania ( and maybe hungary too in the future ) . 
  my favourites are kiskunfelegyhaza and hodmezovasarhely . 
  glad you loved my fun fact . 
  another fun fact from that village . 
  one day i woke up at my aunt 's place and it was my duty to take water from the communal fountain . 
  my aunt told me to not go to the nearest one as the corpse of a neighbour still hangs there . 
  another time my early childhood friend disappeared after breaking up with his gf . 
  three weeks later he was found in a fountain partly decomposed . 
  meanwhile people drank that water and used it for pickles etc. 
  yes , it is a very depressing village . 
  locals call it ujfalu only just as they say ladany only . 
  but that is true for budapest as well when i used to ask tickets at nyugati the clerk said to me ... one ticket to ujfalu with a stopover at ladany . 
  at first i did not understand what she meant . 
  but tbh , the whole alfold region is very boring . 
  i love hungary in the north ( lillafured , eger , tokaj region ) and the part that is west from the danube though . 
  i do n't know about bezbojnicul but i 've been .

  the west supported kiev protesters ( with money and intelligence ) who illegally occupied state buildings and then toppled the president ( without respecting the ukrainian constitution ) . 
  russia supported crimea and eastern ukrainian protesters ( with equipment and intelligence ) who illegally occupied state buildings and attempted secession ( without respecting the ukrainian constitution ) . 
  according to the western press , the first ones are `` freedom fighters '' , the second ones are `` terrorists '' . 
  according to the russian press , the first ones are `` fascists '' , the second ones are `` freedom fighters '' . 
  as someone who is not pro-russia , but neither pro-american/pro-nato , i find it futile to write in / r/europe since anything that is not pro-american gets quickly 20 downvotes . 
  i found it strange that the public opinion in other romanian-language ( or french-language ) forums seem to be more nuanced than in / r/europe , even though romanians are generally far more anti-russian than the average european . 
  also , any article that has any other perspective than the one of the mainstream anglo-american press gets downvoted quite quickly . 
  plenty of reasons : * the authoritarian regime : hundreds of protesters arrested whenever there 's an anti-governmental protest . 
  * beating , torturing and killing journalists and dissidents . 
  ( bloggers get arrested under the charge of `` hooliganism '' ) . 
  * lack of democratic freedoms : the opposition parties boycotted the last elections , because they were not free and fair * the cult of personality of which you find out right when you land at the [ aliyev international airport ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heydar_aliyev_international_airport ) * the corruption ( azerbaijan has a honorable place # 139 in the world 's least corrupt nations ), 
  do n't let facts ruin a good story !, 
  like they used chess during the cold war . 
  ( see the [ match of the century , 1972 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_chess_championship_1972 ) ), 
  of course not . 
  but not even a million tanks in estonia would scare russia because conventional weapons are not going to be used against a nuclear power . 
  the percentage of gdp does n't matter much . 
  buying a tank , a ship or a plane costs the same regardless of your gdp . 
   russia 's behavior is not par with 21st century european standards why is n't anyone outraged about turkey 's behaviour ? 
  their government is not par with 21st century european standards , either . 
  [ they 're imprisoning dozens of journalists critical to the government ] ( http://www.cpj.org/reports/2013/12/second-worst-year-on-record-for-jailed-journalists.php ) , they use the military to terrorize the civilians in kurdish villages , etc. 
  oh , the turkish governmen is on * our * side . 
   i am assuming you are pro-russian ?!, 
  as a true european traitor !, 
  traitor !, 
  a huge military is useless . 
  the eu already spends several times more than russia . 
  russia wo n't be more scared if we spend 4 times as much as them instead of 3 times . 
  russia spends $ 87 billion ; france , uk , germany and italy alone spend more than $ 200 billion . 
  also , gas is not that important to russia . 
  more than half of the russian government 's incomes are from oil , only 5 % is from gas and probably only 2-3 % is from gas exported to the eu . 
  if we really want to fight autocrats in russia and saudi arabia , we need to switch from oil & gas to other energy sources . 
  like deformed male genitalia . 
  not even if it has works of art featuring nudity like [ goya 's la maja desnuda ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2kzjn6t.jpg ) ( spain ) or [ titian 's dana\u00eb ] ( http://static7.depositphotos.com/1298242/789/i/950/depositphotos_7894644-soviet-russia-postage-stamp-painting-dana-titian-woman-nude.jpg ) ( soviet union ) or [ grigorescu 's nude ] ( http://t1.ftcdn.net/jpg/00/32/04/54/400_f_32045431_wc3wivvhlgglxd6hrhamiur1jptjc6dy.jpg ) ( romania ) or [ picasso 's female nude ] ( http://www.colourbox.com/preview/7834043-910962-equatorial-guinea-circa-1974-a-stamp-printed-in-equatorial-guinea-dedicated-to-the-female-nude-in-art-history-shows-the-toilet-by-pablo-picasso-circa-1974.jpg ) ( guinea equatorial ) , etc. 
   the average net wage in romania seems to be 380 euros , not 200 . 
  the median is 250 $ , the average is 380 $ . 
  the average is skewed by the very large incomes , so the median is a better indicator of what the average romanian earns . 
   romania has in fact one of the lowest unemployment figures in whole of eu so jobs are not that scarce as you make it seem romania has the lowest employment figures in the eu ( or at least , it had , now maybe greece is slightly below ) because jobs have been scarce longer than a year or two , so long-term unemployed people slipped from the unemployment registry . 
  fewer than half of the working age residents are employed . 
  the rate for western european and the us is 65-70 % and in scandinavia 75-80 % . 
  speaking of dealing-with-your-past , how do the belgians deal with king leopold 's colonial past ? 
  up to 10 million congolese died due to the starvation , massacres , disease , etc. 
  directly related to the congo free state . 
  does the belgian state considers itself responsible or do they claim it was all king leopold 's fault ? 
  i can see that belgium even issued a [ king leopold ii commemorative euro coin ] ( http://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces22411.html ) , so the public opinion is definitely not on par with hitler in germany . 
  unfortunately , the economic growth is not affecting everyone equally : * bucharest is indeed booming , but most of the country has been stagnating for the last decade . 
  * there are relatively few `` middle class '' workers , mostly concentrated in bucharest and a few bigger cities . 
  * half of the workers earn between 160-250 $ / month ; a third earn the minimum wage . 
  * there are very high inequalities in income ; for instance , as a programmer ( with a rather average wage for my position ) , i earn 10 times the minimum wage . 
  * in most of the country there are no employment opportunities , leading to millions of people working abroad : over a million romanians now live in italy , another million in spain and perhaps another million across the rest of the countries ( germany , uk , scandinavia , france , etc ) . 
  fight against corruption is actually working ( with dozens of mps , a dozen ministers , a prime-minister and countless mayors in prison for corruption and bribe-taking ) , but this failed so far to change the political class . 
  they are just as corrupt as they have ever been . 
  i 'm extrapolating the development of romania ( or bulgaria , or hungary ) during the last 25 years . 
  it 's probably going to be invalidated by technological and geopolitical changes , but if things stay as they are , there wo n't be any fast economical development . 
  actually , it 's because that 's how the founders wanted it . 
  the next states had to accept the status quo to get in . 
  i 'm not claiming it 's powerless . 
  the european parliament may amend a draft law , but it may not initiate a law that the commission does not want . 
  the european parliament is the direct representative of the people , why should we have another institution that is not directly elected to get a veto right ? 
  if things happen like in romania , kiev will be better off , while the small cities and the countryside will be worse off . 
  millions of people from the countryside and the small cities will move to western european countries to work on low-level jobs . 
  members of european parliament can write a legislation and pass it to the commission , which must approve it . 
  basically , if the european commission does n't want a piece of legislation , they will have no problem rejecting it . 
  the parliament proposed a lot of good laws which were then vetoed by the european commission . 
  however , even if they joined the european union , it 's unlikely the average ukrainian will get the european living standards this century . 
  for more details , ask the bottom half of the romanian employees , who earn less than 200 $ / month . 
  but the european parliament has limited powers . 
  unlike virtually any national parliament , it can not write legislation , it can only vote `` yes or no '' for legislation written by the european commission . 
  a european parliament which could write the laws would be a great achievement , but unfortunately , giving the people 's direct representatives some real power is not on the agenda . 
  the agency existed ( under different names ) for ages , but it 's only recently that they started to have some results . 
  the reason why things started to change is that there is a new generation of prosecutors and judges who are more idealistic and not easily bribed . 
    `` running a pyramid scheme '' . 
  maybe they should n't run a pyramid scheme . 
   netherlands has it right in my opinion the only problem is that the part-time wages ( in netherlands and elsewhere ) are not living wages . 
  you ca n't raise a family on that . 
  yes , you 're right . 
  thanks . 
  also , 43 % of ethnic russians want the russian army in ukraine , 43 % oppose . 
  ( edit : fixed figures ) in the east , 59 % want association with russia , 20 % in the eu . 
  saudi arabia is one of the few countries in the world that do n't call themselves a `` democracy '' . 
  like it said , `` small '' means having a value less than $ 1.74 billion . 
  many of them have only a few thousands soldiers in each ( for instance , in a base located in romania they have currently have 1600 soldiers ) , but that does n't meant they are n't bases on foreign soil . 
  an ad hominem solves nothing in a debate . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the people in none of the middle eastern ( pakistan , saudi arabia , qatar , oman , united arab emirates , bahrain , afghanistan , etc ) and latin american countries ( brazil , cuba , etc ) want them . 
  for instance , in a pew opinion poll in pakistan , [ 74 % of people consider the us `` an enemy '' and only 8 % a partner . 
  ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2012/06/27/pakistani-public-opinion-ever-more-critical-of-u-s/ ) . 
  at the request of the government . 
  i bet the people in most of those countries do n't want them . 
  [ from a washington post article ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/ron-pauls-strange-claim-about-bases-and-troops-overseas/2012/02/08/giqapzpqzq_blog.html ) :  the defense department every year publishes a list of military facilities in the united states and around the world . 
  as of sept. 30 , 2010 , the dod list shows a list of 611 military facilities around the world ( not counting war zones ) , though only 20 are listed as `` large sites , '' which means a replacement value of more than $ 1.74 billion . 
  they do the same in romania . 
  sometimes , it 's not money , but paying all expenses for doctors to go to conferences held in a 5-star resorts on some tropical island . 
  also , not only drug companies , but also pharmacies : the doctors get a percentage of the sales if they convince to go to a certain company 's pharmacies . 
  a lot of the us military expenditure is keeping their hundreds of military bases across the world and paying for their ongoing wars . 
  ( afghanistan , pakistan , yemen , etc ), 
  what is the meaning of the black and orange ribbons the protesters wear ? 
  actually , austria is also not part of nato . 
  it declared its neutrality in 1955 . 
  hipster zhirinovski was there before it was cool !, 
  sweden has been officially neutral since 19th century , it 's part of their core national principles to be anti-militaristic .

  the overwhelming majority of roma are sedentary . 
   udmr are not extremists i must have mistaken you for another redditor then . 
   it 's an ethnic party . 
  that is not a bad thing necessarily , although i agree that ideally , there would not be a need for such a party . 
  i thought the title meant `` pro-settlement '' as in `` pro-settlers-from-anatolia '', 
  i think remeber you defining udmr as `` extremist '' . 
  is my memory playing tricks on me ? 
  my point was that the the two situations are different . 
  so was u/criticalstories 's . 
   this kind of irrational fear of extremism ~ ~ you should be the last person to talk about `` irrational fear of extremism '' ~ ~ otoh , you are right in that i might have read to much into the comment . 
  i 'm just sick and tired of this bullshit comparison . 
   does that mean they should n't learn the language ? 
  where did i say this ? 
  u/capycapy 's argument was that citizenship should be based on knowledge of the official language and that romania should do * this * to its hungarian minority [ i.e. 
  give citizenship based on knowledge of the local language ] as you might very well know , romania 's hungarian minority is awarded birthright citizenship ( just like everybody else who is born of parents that are romanian citizens , as opposed to recent immigrants ) . 
  ~ ~ so someone 's either advocating stripping the hungarian minority of citizenship ( which is barred by the constitution anyway ) , or they are quite ignorant , comparing apples with oranges . ~ ~, 
  but 1st generation immigrants do choose the country they emigrate to . 
  so that makes / u/capycapy 's parallel a situation of apples and oranges . 
   it 's worthless from what i 've seen , it 's mostly the dutch who feel insecure about their language and call it `` a small language ''  and ugly de gustibus , i guess . 
   perhaps if you 'd need to learn a simple language ( like english ) okay , but dutch is n't all that simple . 
  english is n't that simple either , tbh . 
  it may be simple on some fronts ( no gender , little declension ) , but it 's complex on others ( verb tenses , all the exceptions to the rules , and the exceptions to the exceptions , and so on ) . 
   seems fair to me me too . 
  if you moved somewhere , basic level of the official language as a prerequisite for citizenship is not that much to ask , tbh . 
   dutch language really is awful when you start learning it . 
  i just started , and i find it quite beautiful . 
  otoh , i think the germans thought they 'd go back to turkey once they were n't needed anymore . 
   after three years residence , they will be entitlrd to irish citizenship . 
  what are the requirements for irish citizenship besides the 3 year period ? 
  there are few among the hungarians in romania who do not speak the language , mostly elderly . 
  what the romanian state needs to do is improve its teaching of romanian . 
   nimetz previously suggested `` the republic of upper macedonia , '' but skopje rejected that proposal as `` utterly unacceptable . '', 
  i 'm curious as to why this was found to be unacceptable . 
  ( `` slavic-albanian macedonia '' is a terrible suggestion imo ), 
   they would just provoke a hungarian-romanian ethnic dispute ( as bloody as needed ) in transylvania , then occupy romania as a peacekeeping / `` democratization '' mission . 
  the fuck did this come from ? 
  first they came for the memes , and i did not speak out -- because i was not an image macro . 
  do n't worry . 
  if it was n't for wikipedia , i 'd never known either . 
   yeah , it is indeed a tiny family . 
  but it 's in [ a very diverse company ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_the_caucasus ) . 
   i heard their language is unique among the globe , actually gerorgian has 3 more sibling languages ( 2 spoken in georgia , which i think , not sure , might be viewed as dialects - svan and mingrelian - and 1 spoken in turkey - laz ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kartvelian_languages, 
  shvili, 
  well , you 're an odd combination of family name and flair , 
   i already think mods can be heavy handed on these subjects , having it written down as a hard and fast rule is just going to make the environment even more oppressive these are the general principles we 've been moderating on so far , so it 's not like we just made them stricter . 
   saying `` i do n't think gay people should be able to marry . '', 
  may appear homophobic , `` i do n't want romanians and bulgarians to come to our shores . '', 
  could be xenophobic and `` roma are much more likely to commit crime . '', 
  might be racist , all depending on which eyes read it . 
  none of the sentences above are written in a hateful tone . 
  compare with `` gays should fuck off '' or `` gypsies are thievin scum '' . 
  on a side-note , a lot of politically very incorrect language is left undeleted in the roma threads . 
  only the worst of the worst is actually deleted . 
  yes . 
  ( we ca n't help with the downvotes though ), 
  there 's an element of style as well , so to say . 
  if the opinion is xenophobic at heart but the way it 's framed is open to discussion , we 're much more likely to leave it be . 
  off the top of my head :  `` i think non-european immigration should be heavily discouraged because they are more likely to be culturally incompatible and thus prone to creating social friction . 
  there are problems with multiculturalism such as ... '' versus  `` keep those shit-cultures out of europe !, 
  multiculturalism is literally raping our beautiful western civilization '' the first example is setting up a conversation , albeit from an unpopular position . 
  the second example is just hateful ranting . 
   it 's changed since & now it 'd be grouped with brasov county . 
  i do n't think that 's necessarily bad , given how interconnnected covasna and brasov counties are economically . 
  you could have a szeklerland + burzenland region , for example , in a trento-alto-adige style set-up . 
  but the devil would be in the details . 
   at the very least , basic recognition would be nice , and not be referred to as the `` so-called '' `` szeklers '' of `` szekler land '' . 
  yeah , i agree , that 's douchey . 
   an alphabet that looks kinda like the armenian one , but possibly no relation other than the same style of calligraphy ? 
  they are related . 
  some say they were invented by the same guy ( saint somebody ) and both ultimately derive from the phoenecian alphabet , probably via greek . 
  tbilisi is capital . 
  sakartvelo is endonym . 
  land of golden fleece from jason and the argonauts . 
  iberia and colchis . 
  used to be called gruzia as well ( which i favour because it eliminates confusion with another georgia ) kartvelian language ( s ) ( only found in caucasus ) everybody 's named - shvili or - dze . 
  had 3 autonomous regions . 
  adjaria is a region for `` muslim georgians '' ( sort of , most are christian there as well ) . 
  abkhazia and south ossetia had important non-georgian minorities ( first are north-west caucasians , second are iranic , related to the alans , some of which gave us some toponyms in hunggary and romania ) saakashvili was very pro-west and stupid enough to go to war with russia . 
  made some radical pro-market reforms . 
  wine country . 
  orthodox country . 
  anti-gay country . 
  got fucked over by the mongol invasion at their peak . 
  recently changed flag . 
  liked the old one better . 
  new one just screams `` crusader state '' . 
   have a poll conducted to asses the percentage of hungarians who want autonomy . 
  no such initiative has been put forth by either romanian or hungarian politicians . 
  at the same time , no plan has been put forth regarding what this autonomous region would entail . 
  both these things need to happen . 
  but it 's to every politicians ' advantage these not happening , so both sides can claim their position as true in the absence of any evidence to the contrary . 
   that map was proposed by a single nationalistic usl mp two years ago and has received no attention since then . 
  not to mention the fact that it mixes historical romanian regions , so it does n't have support even from the ethnic romanians . 
  he 's referring to this : [ royal hungary ( part of habsburg empire ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_hungary_%281538%e2%80%931867%29 ), 
   i actually wish the sz\u00e9kelys politicians would understand and address the concerns of the other romanians . 
  [ ... ] that 's why i 'm frustrated by their common , greedy politicians , incapable to see this great opportunity that they could intelligently champion for all romanians with the sz\u00e9kelys getting some bonus benefits . 
  if only they would be capable to talk with the rest of the country , if only they would not be so blind in their greed and if only they would be intelligent enough to strike acceptable compromises . 
  amen to this . 
  they really need to address the concerns of the majority if they wish to get popular support for the move . 
  so far they 've done it to a less than satisfactory level .

  there is no question russia sent weapons , supplies , training and men to the separatists . 
   and i still do n't get what the big difference is between , the situation in kiev half a year ago and now around the donezk area . 
  the ukrainian army completely cut off donetsk from the rest of the territory controlled by separatists , and it 's likely to fall to the ukrainian army very soon . 
  also the territory the separatists control is between 20-25 % of the territory they controlled a few months ago . 
  if donetsk falls , it 's likely the rest of the territory will follow shortly after . 
  putin invested lots of political capital on backing the separatists and russia is now subject to sanctions because of it . 
  if the separatists lose , putin looses also both inside russia and outside it . 
  lets be honest , turkey 's been a candidate since forever , but i do n't see it actually joining the eu in the next 50 years , if ever . 
  is your sarcasm detector malfunctioning today ? 
  gain ? 
  he does n't have strictly much to gain , but he have a lot to lose if he does nothing and ukraine eliminates all the terrorists . 
  it would be a political defeat of such size it would be unmatched in his political history . 
  he actually backed himself into that corner , but he 's there now . 
  oh good , i was getting worried that russia was n't invading ukraine , glad to see the invasion is back on schedule . 
  did they run out of stock already ? 
  i 'd have thought most supermarket chains would have a stock that would last at least two weeks . 
  go the romanian embassy or a consulate and ask them to make you a romanian passport . 
  well good luck !, 
   because london is a great city ? 
  that 's really debatable . 
   and probably a good destination for a fashion model maybe that 's true , i do n't know the fashion world that well , but i always was under the impression that paris and milan were the places to be for fashion . 
  if you still have romanian citizenship yes you can , but why would you want to ? 
  i do n't know if what the article says is true , but i would n't be surprised if it is . 
  putin has been displaying his lunatic tendencies more and more in recent years . 
   i think the most the eu could do that it is n't already doing is explore the possibility of mutual recognition of same-sex partnerships , a bit like how the us handles it . 
  i really do n't see that happening . 
  any such recognition would have financial and legal implications , the eu would have a revolt on its hand . 
   i 'd say there a 60-70 % chance that we will . 
  however , not right now . 
  i think you 're dreaming , unless you 're talking on a really long term basis . 
  i do n't see it happening at all in the next 50 years and very unlikely in the next 100 years . 
   to be fair the british empire did enter ww2 over poland . 
  after fucking over czechoslovakia . 
   i kinda see what you mean , but we have sent some troops to eastern europe in the last few days to ` train ' . 
  which is good . 
   do eastern european governments think they will ever be invaded by russia ? 
  they absolutely think it 's a possibility . 
  it certainly would n't be the first time russia invades eastern europe . 
   also do they think that western european governments would not back them up if they were ever invaded or screwed with like ukraine is ? 
  most western european countries have a history of fucking over eastern europe when it suits them , as such saying you 'll back us up if the need comes is not as compelling as having some of your troops train with ours on the eastern borders . 
  because words are words , but blood will ensure that your countries will enter the war . 
   i think he corrupt ... but possibly the right kind of corrupt . 
  all that is needed is someone who is in opposition to him to do the same . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean . 
   interesting stuff , but now i 've got you to reply ... why does romania and other eastern european governments fear russia so much now they are apart of the eu and nato . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean . 
  rephrase and clarify ? 
   good , but it is kinda selective justice if like you said you think basescus family has indeed been stashing money away . 
  the problem with that is , you need proof . 
  i or anyone else actually do n't have any , all he have is suspicions . 
  people have tried to tie basescu to some shady deals , but they always run into the same problem . 
  they have no proof . 
  so either basescu is simply smarter at stealing than the rest and knows how to hide is trail better or he was n't ever involved . 
   holy shit you would think kicking the people out who were still loyal to the former ` communist ' regime in the 80 's would of been a first priority once your country takes an entirely different direction . 
  you mistake what i said . 
  they were n't still loyal to the regime before 1989 . 
  that regime was dead and everyone knew it , but they were members from that generation . 
  iliescu did n't have a reason to change them , since their loyalty moved to him when he was president , since he protected them and they ( the intelligence , former securitate people ) protected him . 
  it was a mutually beneficial relationship as far as they were concerned . 
  the one that had the first chance to clean up as constantinescu , who was president from 1996-2000 . 
  why he did n't is n't clear , either he was so incompetent that he did n't know he should or he was in on the whole thing . 
   i 'm not sure they trust each other , get along maybe but not trust . 
  call it what you will , but even a working relationship is sign that you believe the other guy is competent and can be trusted somewhat . 
   and they say the eu never does anything . 
  the eu does a lot of things right , there are a lot of reason why the eu enjoys such high poll numbers in romania . 
  i have no doubt that without the eu we 'd still be in the same cesspool we were in the 1990-2000 period . 
   is basescu in your a opinion changing things for the better or worse ? 
  from that comment i got that he 's doing a pretty good job and does want to end corruption , but from other comments people have said that it is selective justice with show trails for people in his own political party ? 
  i do n't know if basescu is changing things for the better , but things have changed for the better . 
  i do n't know if you can give basescu credit for it . 
  basescu did some things very right during his presidency , but i 'm not at all sure he started out with the goal of cleaning up corruption . 
  the way i like to think of it is that the eu pretty much started it , they pushed for it and told the politicians that without actual judicial reform there would n't be an accession . 
  the politicians had no choice but to give in at this point and that started the ball rolling . 
  in this entire situation basescu 's biggest credit come in the form that he 's a very hard man to get along with . 
  which caused constant political fights , but because of these political fight and the fact that the power was almost always divided nobody was able to stop the judicial reforms after they were started . 
  there is no doubt in my mind that basescu is n't clean in all of this , his family was/is involved in some scandals along the way and there is no doubt he was able to put some money away during this time , but as with all things nobody is black or white . 
  i think when history will be written on this 10-20 years from now , basescu will go down as a very flawed individual that while doing some really shady things had a positive impact on romanian history . 
   but from other comments people have said that it is selective justice with show trails for people in his own political party ? 
  people use those words `` show trial '' for absolutely no reason . 
  none of the trials were show trials , all the evidence was real and the crimes were very real . 
  people that think this is `` selective justice '' make a false equivalence and say that shady characters in basescu 's party were just as bad as the ones in the other parties . 
  this is objectively false . 
  firstly , there have been people from basescu 's party that have been investigated and ended up in prison , others are currently facing investigations , including basescu 's brother ( !!! ), 
  which is currently in prison awaiting trial . 
  secondly people in basescu 's party were n't as many , as long in power or as bad in their abuses as those from other parties , mostly psd . 
  so the reason we see more people from psd getting investigated than from any other party , is because more ( most ? ), 
  of the corruption occurs with members in that party which is more like a cancer in romania than anything else . 
  also the people in that party have been in places of authority the longest , as such the time in which they can do shady business is longer . 
  i do n't need to narrow the debate , because i 'm not going to debate it on the merits , since it does n't have any and since this `` article '' got downvote into oblivion i 'll guess i 'm not the only one that think so . 
  goodbye . 
  am i supposed to care who he is ? 
  if he writes trash i 'll treat it like trash . 
  there is nothing in that post that is redeemable . 
  it 's wrong from the start with his comparison of 1914 right up until the very end where he suggests `` maybe we can find a shortcut . '' . 
  you know who also tried to find a short cut through history ? 
  neville chamberlain when signed a pact with the devil in his foolish attempt at not repeating history . 
  the article is junk . 
  what a complete and utter piece of shit of an article , and i use the term loosely . 
  this is so bad i 'd refuse to fertilize a field with it . 
  ecb = killing economies one deflation at a time,

  :-) it 's actually 4x20 +10 which many ( non-french ) europeans will agree is a ridiculous way of calling a number . 
  your belgian/walloon neighbors went for nonante and they deserve some congratulations for that . 
  oh , yes they can . 
  mcv is useful for this but no magic solution . 
  there are a lot of bad measures that can be taken before the safeguards-for the eu/threats-for romania would be under discussion . 
  because many of the high , middle and low ranking members of the party either have problems with the justice system , or the anti-corruption drive seriously endangers their corrupt sources of income ( like getting a bribe from public contracts ) . 
  indeed , they will definitely attack it/try to weaken it . 
  they wo n't probably manage to destroy it but they can substantially weaken it/make it inoffensive . 
  eu support and attention on this will be very important . 
  in all those southern counties , many voters ( 5-10 % ) are paid for and are driven to vote by the social democrats ( psd ) activists . 
  this is illegal but is clearly done . 
  there are now 9 voters in north korea . 
  the opinion piece was written by denis macshane , a british former labour party politician who was convicted of false accounting by falsifying parliamentary expense claims and was most likely ordered/paid for by the psd . 
  the article makes it more sensational that it is . 
  part of the eu aid to ukraine ( and to many other countries ) comes in the form of budget support , meaning that you transfer some money to their budget , for example to help them raise salaries for judges and thus ( somehow ) reduce the likelihood of corruption , or , in the case of ukraine , you help them cover the huge deficit caused by the war in their east and the loss of crimea . 
  obviously that in those cases the eu money gets mixed with ukrainian money and you ca n't follow where exactly your money went . 
  that does n't mean that there are n't a lot of debates about the value of using this sort of support as oppose to project based ones or other . 
  but this is a technical discussion , which this article barely touches . 
  it obviously also does n't mean that we should be more careful about how we spend eu money and have credible and efficient control mechanisms . 
  the union of transylvania with romania was supported by a clear majority of the people of transylvania , the second vienna award was a decision imposed by the totalitarian powers of that time , during wwii . 
  the two decisions do n't have the same legitimacy . 
  i see , but where are you heading in this way , with nationalists trying to outdo other nationalists ? 
  hungarian diplomats participated at similar events in the past 20 years , our diplomats participate in your national day celebrations . 
  they also participate at the national holiday celebrations of ukraine , though we lost romanian populated land to them . 
  that is the normal , european , diplomatic thing to do . 
  thank you very much !, 
  disappointing though to see that hungary 's government decided to ban the presence of hungarian diplomats at the receptions organized by romania today . 
  `` a pilot at lufthansa earns on average 180,000 euros ( $ 190,000 ) a year before tax , though a captain on the highest pay level can earn as much as 22,000 euros a month before tax . '', 
  yet they strike for a pay increase of 3.7 percent while the company wants to offer only 2.5 percent . 
  what a joke . 
  really makes me lose respect for lufthansa pilots . 
  they also strike so often that i do n't see how the brand image is not affected . 
  happy independence day latvia !, 
  that 's how we 're going to get them in the eu . 
  attracting them with maps !, 
  crappy people who did this . 
  i know about renzi 's precarious position but i 'm not sure picking on other countries or the european institutions , as he does on an almost weekly basis , is that useful . 
  this does n't excuse the crappy answer of the hungarians of course . 
  most european countries could develop nuclear weapons if they wanted to . 
  i am no fan of erdogan , very much to the contrary , but only in the last month i 've seen by chance three gatherings/protests of kurds in brussels , each of them with tens of flags carrying the portrait of abdullah \u00d6calan . 
  now i know things are not simple nor black and white even if pkk is considered a terrorist organization by the eu , but the fact remains that it is listed as a terrorist organization and proper action should be taken . 
  i am not that convinced that belgium does that , given that it was incapable to properly deal with much more dangerous ( for itself and its neighbors ) terrorist organizations . 
  again , i am not saying this in support of erdogan or against the kurds , i have no dog in that fight . 
  all i say is that i see a lot of activity by kurds in brussels ( somehow understandable given what is happening in se turkey ) and \u00d6calan 's face being freely displayed around the city . 
  thus i am not surprised that an increasingly nationalistic erdogan is annoyed by that . 
  quite depressing to see this sort of rhetoric , from both sides . 
  i mean really , did these two countries just start having diplomatic relations ? 
  act like fucking adults ( = responsible politicians ) and stop throwing words at each other . 
  you might not believe it but sometimes it happens . 
  :-) seriously now , i know you guys always complain about the quality of their roads but believe me , it can be much worse than belgium . 
  that 's a road and it looks good . 
  in belgium , where i live , they would have needed some 3 weeks to repair it . 
  in romania , some 3 months . 
  while the castle in the bargau/borgo/tihuta pass has no connection to vlad the impaler neither does the bran castle . 
  there is absolutely no proof that vlad the impaler ever staid at bran castle , a castle which was not situated in the state he ruled and which he never controlled . 
  there is also no proof that bram stoker used any other element connected to vlad the impaler than his nickname , dracula . 
  more info here http://io9.gizmodo.com/no-bram-stoker-did-not-model-dracula-on-vlad-the-impal-1648969679 at the same time , in the novel dracula , the castle of the count is clearly situated in the bargau/borgo/tihuta pass and not in the rucar-bran pass , where the bran castle is situated . 
  in romanian we call them john hunyadi , the father : ioan or iancu de hunedoara ( hunedoara being the romanian equivalent of hunyad ) matthias corvinus , the son : matia or matei corvin, 
  i agree :-), 
  i present you the [ moldavian autonomous soviet socialist republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldavian_autonomous_soviet_socialist_republic ) , created by stalin outside ( ! ), 
  the territory of moldavia , on the territory of the ukrainian soviet socialist republic , obviously with the aim to bolster its claim to bessarabia ( eastern moldavia ) , which was part of romania at that time . 
  that is an impressive list , congrats . 
  some small correction and addition . 
   the second balkan war ... northern dobruja to romania romania gained northern dobruja at the end of the 1877-1878 war with the ottomans . 
  romanians also fought in that war , on the side of the russians . 
  for example prince carol i of romania commanded the combined ( romanian-russian ) armed forces to the [ conquest of plevna ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_plevna ) . 
  in romania , the war is know as the [ war of independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_war_of_independence ) at the end of the second balkan war ( 1912 ) we gained [ southern dobruja ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southern_dobruja ) , which we ceded back to bulgaria in 1940 . 
   they joined nato too , probably some years before this since the requirements are n't as difficult . 
  correct , the year is 2004 . 
  also smaller forces of ( romanian ) moldavians and wallachians . 
  [ alexander the good ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_i_of_moldavia ) , ruler of moldavia and a vassal of w\u0142adys\u0142aw ii jagie\u0142\u0142o , commanded the moldavian expeditionary corps . 
  and no , we do n't put billboards about it and do n't claim it as a ` romanian victory ' . 
  not claiming that they directly inspire each other on this but , since the discussion went that way , [ here is an example ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/erdogan-meets-abbas-with-military-dress-show.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=76853&amp;newscatid=510 ) with erdogan flanked by actors dressed in the military costumes of 16 states founded throughout history by turkic people , because it seems that for him turk and turkic are the same thing . 
   blamed for many things today can you please elaborate on this ? 
  what is he/they blamed for ? 
  i am asking because from outside of poland , one would think that being the only eu country to not go into recession during the economic crisis was quite an achievement . 
  now i know that reality was more complicated than that and i read that they ( po ) were at times arrogant but i still do n't understand/know how come they lost so much support and are so hated , so i would appreciate if you could elaborate on that . 
  thank you . 
  close to that , i saw the malbork castle and they had a similar '' toilet '' there . 
  those teutons were serious about disposing of their shit . 
   not sure how solid this theory is though , i imagine not very . 
  there is no shred of evidence for this ` theory ' , just the imagination of some people . 
  their main promoter , napoleon savescu , is a doctor ... in medicine . 
  their ideas/theories are clearly rejected and dismissed by the historian community but unfortunately they are quite active on the internet and manage to convince poorly educated people looking for even grander origins/history . 
  the wild 1990s https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mineriad, 
  the information about these turbines possible delivery to crimea existed long before the turbines were delivered to russia . 
  the issue was clear , siemens chose to proceed because money . 
  there was no duping , siemens knew where these turbines would be installed , they just do n't care about that , they care about the money . 
  or see this bit from this recently published report of a polish think-tank `` the three seas concept , promoted by poland , is met in the remaining visegrad countries with distance and a lack of understanding . 
  warsaw stresses that the main aim of the initiative is better cooperation in the development of infrastructure , transport and digitalization , as they are not at a satisfactory level in the region . 
  however , in the other visegrad countries and also in other eu states the project is perceived as politically motivated , aiming to create a counterbalance to western europe , especially germany . 
  this view is reinforced by donald trump 's appearance at the heads of states summit in poland in july . 
  developing such regional forms of cooperation , even if only loose and not institutionalized , is considered to be harmful for european unity . 
  the czech republic and slovakia , in particular , assess it negatively . 
  furthermore , the unpredictability of the american president 's actions and comments raise fears that one can expect a similar situation to when donald rumsfeld , the former us secretary of defense , said that there is an `` old '' and a `` new '' europe . 
  in slovakia and in the czech republic , as well as in pro-eu expert circles in poland , there are worries that this division into new and old europe will make a comeback . '', 
  thanks for the links , i knew about the first two projects , but not about the atlantic council & pwc report . 
  if it would be only that , then maybe fine ( as you guys already have the v4 for coordination ) , but i 'm afraid there might be a larger game being played . 
  see these bits from a politico story linked below . 
  i think the `` former senior official from another three seas member state '' being quoted is representative for the kind of skepticism/worries the current polish leadership creates in some parts of our the region ( though i 'm not sure about the `` are welcoming of refugees '' part ) .

   how exactly would that happen ? 
  do you think putin stands to win an engagement with conventional forces ? 
  i do n't know but i know who will lose , everyone . 
  i do n't think anyone would be stupid to get the whole world blown . 
  ukraine 's current leadership 's ideals/dreams is not worth the death of hundred of thousand or even millions european , russian or americans . 
  it 's something we can simply not gamble or bluff . 
  so you 're saying that we should draw a red line over something ? 
  if it gets broken then what ? 
  how about russia 's red line , should we ignore it ? 
  i mean they stated many times and were very explicit that trying to get ukraine into nato and foreign involvement in ukraine is a red line , we ca n't say whatever happened after maidan took us by surprise . 
  my question is , what do we if red line meets red line ? 
  start a war with russia ? 
  destroy europe and maybe the whole world for the sake of having ukraine in the western sphere of influence ? 
   most of the people in the east want nothing more than to live in peace . 
  i think people everywhere want to live in peace . 
   increase the cost for russian intervention in ukraine until it becomes unfeasible for putin to be there . 
  and we ca n't increase that without worsening the situation . 
  i do n't think russia will quit until they no longer feel threatened , maybe until they can be sure ukraine does n't join nato or ignore moscow . 
  so far we have a couple of solutions to solve that mess : 1 . 
  federalization of ukraine . 
  not sure if it would fully solve it , but russia seemed interested in it . 
  negotiate with russia so that ukraine can join/follow eu in exchange of a non-nato entry . 
  i think they fear more nato entry than eu . 
  give russia something in exchange for giving up ukraine while assuring russians of ukraine will not have their rights stomped . 
  you 're making it sound like it 's something easy that can be solved . 
  in reality there is a very complex problem which can not be solved , as there is no real target . 
  what would the desired outcome of the situation be ? 
  because i feel like everyone who wants us to interfere more is just idealistic and lacks a sense of reality . 
  ukraine is a torn country with most of its problem being internal rather than external , they are nowhere in shape to join eu ( hell , they are even worse than romania when we joined and everyone got upset about it ) so that 's at least a decade away , crimea 's not going back to ukraine regardless of what eu does , and there is still a huge pro-russian population in ukraine and again it 's nothing eu can do about it . 
  so i have no idea what the people who keep yelling that germany/eu does nothing expect us to do . 
  expect us to sacrifice our own economies to sustain the ukrainian economy ? 
  with out huge internal problems ( greece ? 
  spain ? 
  italy ? 
  ) , we have so many problems to overcome inside of eu that we ca n't afford to focus anywhere else . 
  the ideals of eu is to become a community , a common economy , integration of countries and evolution and eu is doing great , countries are getting more integrated , it avoids war ( and when i mean that just look at the history of the last two centuries , do n't just give me ukraine or yugoslavia ) in europe and that 's amazing . 
  ukraine needs to sort itself out , it 's not us that can do it , it 's something they need to , they have expectations that are not on par with reality , some of them are really idealistic and just thought that they 'll join the eu and become another germany , they have n't even come to terms about their own differences . 
  germany 's the engine of the eu and they main force behind it , whether we like it or not , they do have a bigger say in its affairs than anyone else and has a bigger responsibility than anyone else , for example see the economical crisis and problems of eu states . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that it 's completely normal and expect-able that they put their self interest and eu 's interest before other things . 
  i know there 's a lot of hate for germany because they act like they own the eu at times , but we should face the truth . 
  it 's dumb to assume germany 's afraid of anyone . 
  they are n't , they have reached a certain point of wisdom ( they are n't doing great because they are stupid ) where they have learned to think on a long term . 
  their politic and external politic is very good and helpful for both germany and the eu , they manage to keep good contacts around the world which is extremely important . 
  for example , as far as russia , germany 's one of the few countries that are seen as valuable partners . 
  true , but it 's not like this is in any way relevant since in the eastern block you never had to worry about paying off your house or finding a workplace . 
  there was a pretty much permanent state of war with brief pauses when they managed to kill our leaders and put their own for a few years until he suffered the same fate and repeat . 
  that 's pretty common everywhere i think . 
  we romanians like to bash our country like no other , but the moment a foreigner does it ... it 's war !, 
  that 's icao regulations , means they are for the civil aviation , they do not apply to military aircraft . 
  the military communication channels are agreed by more parties . 
  because if turkey did warn but on a different channel than the one agree , it 's meaningless . 
  i saw it from bucharest that night , around 00:15 local time . 
  it was a pretty big flash , i was somewhat upset that no one else seemed to have seen it . 
  terrorists like that do n't have heavier anti-air systems . 
  what happened with mh17 is not plausible here , a buk was there to ensure the ukrainian af does n't bomb the rebels , and the passenger plane was confused with a fighter or a bomber . 
  that 's incredibly ignorant of you . 
  trains are awesome means of transport and have been , especially back before ' 89 , widely used by all categories of population . 
  in fact they are still widely used today , and from the numbers looks like rail traffic is making a small comeback . 
  though keep in mind there 's different classes of trains , with some ( regio - local trains ) being the ones used by commuters and all images provided are from such train ( cheapest trains ) . 
  that looks amazing , it 's really sad they will destroy it , even if it 's only 150 years old . 
  i remember playing that game when i was a kid . 
  let 's review this discussion , i think we 're missing . 
  you are saying that war memorial tanks ( unused tanks ) need ** significant ** maintenance and repairing before you can get them to work . 
  i 'm saying that you do n't , since even taking tanks from swamps were made to work with ** insignificant ** maintenance . 
  to sustain , i 've mentioned all those cases , and i 've even found the videos for the su-152 which was taken out of a forest pond ( if i remember correctly ) and some mechanics made it work in the same day : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aker9iwkjke so if abandoned tanks like that can be made to work on its own without ** significant ** maintenance then obviously war memorial or museum tanks can also . 
  and let 's clarify , significant means a lot of work , i view that as in weeks of maintenance , eventually changing a lot of its original parts . 
  insignificant for me means that it takes maximum a couple of days and keeps 90 % of its original parts . 
  why is that ? 
  that 's what they all do , they are masters of spinning shit around until it gets in a favorable position . 
  i never said you just walk out with them off memorials , i mentioned they are very sturdy and very simple , thus easy to make them function . 
  i do n't understand what you 're arguing here about , you just keep mentioning they need significant maintenance to make them work while just youtubing tanks being taken out of swamps and lakes , then someone with good knowledge of tank 's systems does a couple of hours of work and they get it to start . 
  another thing to note is that all russian tanks , especially the t-34 , were built very simple and to use common parts of vehicles like tractors or trucks . 
  you can see videos with russians that use t55s to plough their land , and they repair it with the same parts they get for their trucks/tractors . 
  that is embarrassing , however i have a high regard for lavrov , he 's a very good diplomat , has good and concise speeches , keeps his cool and has a very `` diplomatic '' way to talk . 
  such a joyful and friendly bear . 
  i think they 've always had one towards europe . 
  i do n't think that includes us though . 
  same in romania . 
  look , nobody 's saying you just get a tank out of the mud , pour fuel and go home with it . 
  it definitely takes cleaning ( which i can see is done by water jet ) and some maintenance but it 's not exactly what i 'd call significantly maintenance and repair work . 
  i think it took a day for that su-152 to have its engine started and move on its own . 
  of course you ca n't just go to battle after that and it 's likely to break down soon unless `` significant maintenance '' but you ca n't take it from them that they are extremely sturdy and simple . 
  not wwii russian tanks or vehicles , those were a monument of simplism and resilience . 
  i laughed out loud , so true . 
  while indeed , it would be impossible to find out , i do believe communism was the best solution for a few decades following the wars , our country was ravaged by war and took a lot ( maybe too many ) sacrifices but it got put into the right direction - industrialization , bringing education to the masses , helping people rise above poverty , creating the infrastructure , organizing the society etc. 
  however , communism ( at least how it as applied here ) has brought us everything good it have , and making a graduate approach to democracy and capitalism would have been the perfect transition . 
  before bringing any analogies with the west , keep in mind we did not have any culture of democracy , so capitalism would 've likely lead to what has been happening post 90 , exploitation of the many at the expense of the very few . 
  i 've never heard anyone to ever say we have an ugly country ... 
  very informative , but can you detail the spinners used to regulate the entire grid , i 'm quite curious as i 've never heard about it . 
  it 's not clear what they did yet , plus the protest was announced for a few days , a lot of people came from the country for it . 
  we do , but it 's not stopping deforestation , we need more drastic measures . 
  that 's partially correct . 
  it was legalized in '57 then again forbidden in '66 after the birthrate decrease was thrown on abortion legalization . 
  if vk is propaganda but fb is n't , you 're the owner of an incredibly biased mind . 
  again , vk is literally a russian facebook , you said it 's a propaganda machine . 
  so facebook is a propaganda machine ? 
  our president said that since internal investigations have proved there were no cia prisons here , he does not want to have more investigations . 
  that 's romania , usa 's bitch , and that 's our dumb american ass licking president ... 
  this is one of the reasons it pisses me off our government does n't invest * anything * in serious archeological and historical studies . 
  there 's so much more to learn :( .

  we do n't need to be guilt-tripped into following idiotic paths because they can get headline space . 
  if we did , why do n't we also open the door to anti-vaccine fanatics , and every other fringe loony that feels left out . 
  you underestimate the mental barriers in europe regarding world relevance . 
  we 're completely unprepared to accept the idea of filling a power vacuum , let alone do it . 
  while some individuals member state would be interested , they would be unable to muster the strength . 
  and the council governorship means the eu thinks like the average of its members instead of the sum . 
  so we will always have the policy of a country like austria , because that is the compromise point all countries can reach . 
  combine this with euro-phobic elements fearing the eu taking any precedence over the national government on the world stage and the future is clear . 
  if america withdraws , europe will not strengthen , it will go into delusional mode trying to find a way to stay internationally irrelevant but still maintain prosperity . 
  likely this will mean the individual members will try to find new spheres of influence to fall into . 
  please take the time to check friedrich liszt , as well as the development history of the asian tigers , the rise of china , the modern german economy and us corporate and trade policy . 
  advanced economies got to where they are through government backed corporations , and strict economic management . 
  in europe this took the form of dirigism and ordoliberalism , in the uk through the nationalizations of the post-war consensus and previously the mercantilist system ( free market british empire only happened at it 's peak of market dominance ) , in america the military-industrial complex , in japan the foreign exchange allocation policy and the keiretsu , in south korea the chaebol . 
  the truth of the world is that dominant players tend to win , and pull the ladder from behind them . 
  the truth is that large economic actors have political influence through economic growth and job creation without actually needing to bribe someone . 
  the truth is that economies of scale and market synergy make industries cluster geographically . 
  accepting this and planning around this allows economies to grow and prosper . 
  the `` free market '' credo is what you tell those you want to exploit , by having them lower their defenses . 
  i do n't think you realize that `` competition stiffing government regulations '' are the reason advanced countries got to where they were . 
  if that was n't the case , the steelyard would still exist in london and the uk 's greatest economic export would be wool . 
  the `` free-market economies '' are some of the most deviously protectionist and controlling in the world . 
  the key is balancing the protectionism with a smart internal strategies for growth . 
   so someone unaware of the situation would n't expect romania ( of all countries ) to be ahead of the uk in one specific ` sector ' . 
  i suggest travelling through the uk and take note of anything that involves infrastructure . 
  i really wish someone actually took the time to learn the reason why romania is doing better . 
  romania went through every stage of development . 
  i 've had dial-up , dsl , cable , ethernet , one after the other . 
  you are right in one thing , it is more expensive in the uk . 
  they went fully underground wiring a long time ago . 
  their infrastructure is a mess as a result , and updating it involves finding out where the existing infrastructure is . 
  and it almost always involves digging up a section of town . 
  then there 's all sort of nimby behaviour which try to prevent cell towers `` spoiling the view '' . 
  by comparison romania allows pole mounted wiring and visible cell stations , which cuts costs . 
  because of this the uk telecommunications market has high barriers of entry . 
  and so dominant companies are more interested in milking every penny from their existing infrastructure rather than building new one . 
  to add to this , the british have undergone a governance change to market-oriented behavior . 
  a town council is more likely to try to charge a company for the right to place anything in their jurisdiction , than try to help implement anything . 
  whenever they do implement anything private-public partnerships are all the rage , with one company being tasked to find a way to milk customers to implement a council idea free of cost . 
  this is not conductive for good it infrastructure . 
  overall , the uk and i imagine the rest of western europe faces an uphill battle in catching up . 
  although it is very possible on condition that government find a way to give support to companies installing new infrastructure despite the harsh legislation , or even do it themselves and turn telecommunication infrastructure into a national competence . 
  why , when it serves to maintain the illusion of opposition to have him run ? 
  unfortunately , i have no doubt putin enjoys support in russia . 
  those that do n't support him are likely in a state of complete apathy to the system . 
  we 've seen his type in italy with berlusconi , in turkey with erdogan , in hungary with orban . 
  once the media is tamed , their public support does n't waver as long as they look strong and make sure 50.1 % are happy enough . 
  and not even 50.1 % percent of the total population , just of the people who 're likely to vote . 
  you can run a country on an active minority pretending to be the majority . 
  also much easier from our point of view . 
  with the us looking like it 's going to back off from tpp , it puts the benefit of that entire treaty into question . 
  japan is likely looking for a replacement , and there 's very few games in town of that scale . 
  have you been in the north of europe ? 
  supposedly the best functioning states on earth , with a population who lives completely parallel to the goings of celestial bodies . 
  i think the whole daylight-dependence is overplayed and slightly subjective , both in timezone and daylight savings change arguments . 
  on the other hand , the confusion and difficulties surrounding the balkanization of time keeping is objective . 
  strange fact is that america actually did what the europhobes are suggesting . 
  after economic difficulties caused by weak bank regulation in the early 19th century , the narrative that it was the fault of the new central bank was peddled and believed , leading to the closing of the 2nd bank of america . 
  nearly a hundred years later , when the exact thing happened again , the federal reserve was created . 
  a more broken system , in my opinion , because of the strong financial interests that have developed since then on the back of the chaos . 
   anything that stops the uk being able to change regulation or put in place new regulation wo n't be best for the uk . 
  the entire modern international legal environment , including things like the wto and the geneva convention ? 
   `` the ottoman turks ceased to be a menace to the christian world '' . 
  and the christian world continued to be a menace to the christian world until the revolutions took power from the clergy , sieged the vatican and ended the millennia and a half political , ethical and economic stagnation of the continent . 
  got to love how people in our `` civilization '' still praise what is essentially secterian violence between the crazy desert faiths that are the abrahamic cults . 
  and streamlined decision making . 
  what is wrong with suggesting that ? 
  eurozone is a clear sign of poor management , so is the schengen and asylum policy . 
  no state has influence in north africa and the middle east anymore . 
  we 're dealing with economic warfare from china . 
  what exactly is the solution to this besides getting our shit together ? 
  just a reminder , she was the [ council 's choice for the president of the commission ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-commission-lagarde-iduskbn0ee24o20140603 ) , including support from the uk . 
   the problem is 2 fold ... people in serbia dont want to change their life style ... second they are all magically waiting for a better economic environment ... ie 1980s yugoslavia ... 
  the cringey part is that is the point that the sanu memorandum was released , which accused the government of economically hurting serbia . 
  are you bloody kidding me ? 
  you might not hear about it because it 's done in back rooms where everyone saves face , but when it boils over those who pay attention see the signs . 
  how do you think the swiss bank secrecy got watered down ? 
  how do you think the japanese yen was made to revalue in the 80s ? 
  what do you think india is doing now with nepal 's constitution ? 
  the eu gives countries a vote , a seat at a table , clear rules to abide . 
  outside it there is only the strong and the weak , and small countries bend their internal policies all the time . 
  it 's funny how you figure they have a choice . 
  it 's either be part of the eu or be influenced by the eu . 
  the only `` sovereign '' country that is small is north korea , and they are sovereign in being free to be ignored by everyone . 
  sovereignty is `` my country stronk ! '', 
  in a fancy word . 
  but your country is n't , few are . 
  and even the big empires know their `` sovereignty '' ends where another empire 's `` sovereignty '' begins , aka `` do n't mess in my sphere of influence '' . 
  the eu has given you the biggest gift you can hope for : the illusion that if it did n't exist you could do as you please . 
  it turned you into the national version of `` soon to be millionaires '' if only the state stop getting in the way . 
  comments like this make me wish the eu never expanded , just to leave room for an example of how little separates us all from becomingvthe middle east . 
  now we 're all in this mental euro-bubble where we pretend shit like small countries having ` sovereignty ' . 
  to begin with , poland is n't facing any court case as far as i know . 
  the opposite is happening with there being 2 court cases against the council because of the quota system , ( case c-647 / 15 , case c-643 / 15 ) and `` could '' maybe is n't something you want to say when you ca n't back it up . 
  you `` could '' be a mass murderer , anyone could . 
  the posted workers debate again . 
  and here i was hoping for genuine ambition . 
  half the `` news '' these days are opinion pieces , the other half poorly-researched click bait . 
  i would have preferred for example an link to the court case . 
  but i guess it 's pointless to ask , when it 's clear that narrative-affirming ass pulling is happening . 
   hungary could be facing legal actions for its fence .

  because there has been barely no innovation over 2nd and 3rd generation devices .

  whats the big deal with st george ? 
  he is an important ortodox saint as far as i know . 
  orthodox christian , we don ; t need those western heretics !, 
  cause she is a woman , and the guys has a problem with that ... sad . 
  yes , he couldnt get in romania cause of this ... 
  good job britain !, 
  this is non sense ... the british needed to get this out of their system so that we can move together in the future ... in the end it 's all for the future . 
   extend life expectancy , does n't really help us from a macro economic point of view , after a certain age the marginal cost attributed to one extra year of life is costing more and more the system . 
  you may have a slower decline in population but that also means that you will shift the burden of an older population to a shrinking youth base . 
  it 's all about proportions of demographics . 
  if you manage increase life expectancy in your country than you need a higher birth rate boost in order to compensate the shift in demographics . 
  you can get the pie bigger of smaller , but the important thing is to have constant proportions . 
  again this is purely economic perspective and has nothing to do with the social perspective which has its own amendments to any long term demographics strategy .

  benelux could technically have it 's own combined welfare system if they wanted to ... 
  there is no good nationalism if you are referring to the ideology . 
  nationalism is just an advanced form of tribalism . 
  we know it 's bad cause we 've seen it unfold in our history so many times . 
  meaning we had a taste of it , we know how the ideology defines its parameters , and the usual socio economic policies that accompanies it . 
  the form nationalism takes is a not mystery to us , it 's just relieved history . 
  the only differences are context and nuances . 
  nationalism is a self defined ideological construct , this is why it has a bad connotation . 
  depends on the language : patriod has a good connotation , nationalist has a bad connotation . 
  yes but there are other friendlier alternatives to microsoft , one of them is android for day to day use .

  it wo n't matter in the future , the commission is changing how profits are payed and distributed in between eu members , so it will be irrelevant what countries like ireland , luxembourg or the netherlands will do . 
  ofc as long as they do n't fk up competition inside their national borders . 
  if thy want to tax apple 1 % , no biggie , but they should propose the same offer to all the companies operating there ( eu companies , irish companies , other non eu entities etc ) . 
  ireland still has very low corporate taxes . 
  also in the future it wo n't matter since the commission is developing a new system of double taxation avoidance for the eu where it doest matter where one exits it 's money , depending on the money source each country will get its share . 
  ireland can keep its loopholes but it will only tax a small fraction of the money funneled through its jurisdiction . 
  the discussion here is more complex and it 's not about the future but about the past as well as taxing the money from the us market ( also fueled through ireland ) before the us changes its fiscal policy and starts going after all the money stashed abroad and not repatriated ( read money as profits ) . 
  yes they should threaten with article 50 if brussels continues its bullying ... / s, 
  saying that ireland 's only competitive advantage is tax shield and the country will be doomed being or aspiring to be something else , it 's like saying that rom\u00e2nia 's only future is wage dumping and living in a permanent state of relative poverty . 
  not my kind of logic kido . 
  but what if the mother is an animal ... how do they reconcile with that ? ...

  with such a consistent economic growth quarter after quarter no wander our education system has so high standards . 
  yes but remember that this protectionism you are damning is the one that gave a decent amount of pennies and competitive advantages to many of your local farmers ... there are always unintended consequences ... london might be thriving on services and unique skill sets but the rest of the country operates on other variables ... 
  because they are companies , registered in europe with vies registration that file tax returns inside the eu . 
  for example , everytime big companies merge at a global level , they have to check in each country they operate that they are eligible for the merge . 
  is not unknown that in some cases big companies had to sell some of their assets/brands in order for their market share to drop and to be eligible for the merge ... on another matter , one of the possible backlashes towards globalization could be an anti trust * crusade * in the next decade ... 
  i do n't think those amendments would have passed in most eu countries . 
  it 's irrelevant from where you import . 
  either it 's from spain or maroco , it hardly matters . 
  you will import from whichever country is cheaper . 
  so ... as long as european products and services are price competitive you will trade with he eu . 
  you could put tariffs on eu just for the love of tariffs , but tariffs are used mostly to protect a local capability , otherwise it is just a form of soft embargo and it may send the wrong message .

  and the company pays for everything . 
  yes ... it was an article on the telegraph this week about it so i am not sure how accurate they wan na be about this issue .

  epic news ... guess i have to stop slaking off and finish the games !, 
  well i did n't think it through about the fact that naval planes are variants of the land versions , but i never implied that germans should operate the italian carrier just to `` rent it '' and bring up the equipment and specialized personnel they need in order to continue their mission in the area . 
  is n't this a repost ? 
  tbh it makes sense , if everyone was doing it a way or another : either we absolve everyone or we punish everyone ... 
  this is a touchy subject i ca n't tell what was happened in other countries but in romania it is pretty much clear . 
  after the revolution , when finally western companies had access to our market , they had to adapt cause our purchase power was low so either if they imported directly or bought production centers locally they adapted their products to our purchase power and quality knowledge . 
  that made sense cause the price was also romanian ( with some exceptions for some premium very expensive products ) . 
  but over the years as prices for goods increased and matched more or less western levels , lower quality became higher margins . 
  it 's not all their fault of course , since the consumer plays an important part as well as the lack of local alternative that would have the capital and marketing know how to go toe to toe with the western giants . 
  what they do is not illegal since they indeed label correctly their products , but it is immoral that at a similar price you sell to your western market one product and another one of lower quality to your eastern counterpart . 
  i mean they would do the same shit to the western market if they could but there is also another baseline for consumer acceptance , a higher disposable income for the premium alternative and more local alternatives whose only competitive advantage with the giants is their quality . 
  basically a lot of market force that the east lacks and it will take a lot of time for them to develop . 
  also the eu is not that eager to handle this hot potato , one because it is a very subjective matter and it is very hard to draw a line and also because this will increase the operational cost of products for everyone and prices will have to increase both for the west and east ( cause of the way manufacturing works and the fact that it is very costly to offer consistent quality especially in the food industry where you have so many variables - for example some brands send their lower quality batches of product to the hypermarket on private label and mostly breakeven on those batches , but at least what is a pg or a nestle or a milka labeled is top quality ) . 
  damn sucks ... 
  germany should just use italian carrier as a base in the east mediterranean and fk erdogan  ) . 
  also was n't there cyprus naval base who was commission to the russians and was a big fuss about it . 
  guess it would make sense if the eu would rent the base permanently or at least till this conflict is over . 
  and who drink the same vodka and eat the same sausage as us  ), 
  perfect !, 
  that is the way to go !, 
  nop , the f22 are , and i think the superhornets were also designed with this in mind . 
  yes the drama and rip off is happening mostly in the us . 
  well all big european countries have export areas from agro to equipment and high tech and services . 
  as for germany its backbone is ee , where the cheap supply chain lays .

  in practice , our army would kill people at the drop of a hat . 
  in 1907 , the ( literally ) starving peasants began rioting . 
  the army killed over 10,000 peasants ; they used cannons against them . 
  whenever workers began striking , the army would shoot and kill them . 
  if you were left-wing , you were fair game . 
  thousands of people were sent to prison just for being left-wingers . 
  owning certain books was a crime . 
  the 1923 constitution banned executions in peacetime , with one exception : communists . 
  if you were convicted to be a communist ( having communist beliefs was enough ) , you could have been executed , though most were just convicted to forced hard labour for life . 
  i do n't see one reason why the same kind of repression would have not continued . 
   you should n't assume that we would n't do it ourselves if we were able to . 
  but we * did * it ourselves . 
  after 1958 , we were n't doing what the soviets said anymore . 
  they wanted romania to be an agricultural country , we refused and began industrialization . 
  much of our cultural elite happened to be fascists . 
  some of them `` repented '' and stayed here , some even supported the communists . 
  some of the fascists refused to repudiate their ideology , including some great names of romanian culture , such as eugen ionesco , emil cioran and mircea eliade . 
  they were forced to stay in exile . 
  i 'm not saying there were no honest victims during the 1950s , but many of the people who are now seen as `` heroes '' and `` martyrs '' in romania for `` fighting communism '' were simply fascists , who , a decade earlier were writing virulent antisemitic pamphlets and some were even involved in the pogroms . 
  it 's hard for me to have any pity for the iron guard members who were involved in the infamous abattoir killings , when jews ( including children as young as 5 ) were put on hooks alive like cattle in the bucharest slaughterhouse before being tortured and killed . 
  one that one of the leaders of the social-democratic partito democratico said they 're `` anarchists '' . 
  that 's a slightly better description , but just slightly . 
  an even better description would be `` libertarians '' , in the european meaning of the word . 
  ( i.e. 
  left-wing libertarians , not american-style ayn rand fans ), 
  yup . 
  berlusconi calls everyone who is critical of him a `` communist '' . 
  the economist magazine ran a series of articles about his government 's incompetence and corruption and he called it `` the ecommunist '' , nevermind that the magazine has a capitalist point-of-view . 
  the words for `` i-don ` t-like-you '' are `` fascist '' , in left-wing vocabulary and `` communist '' , in right-wing vocabulary . 
  do you think that giving regular people more power is something to be scared of ? 
  i feel that many people think democracy is a good idea only as long as the people do n't have any actual power . 
   while there is plenty of employment opportunities for less skilled labour . 
  there may be more opportunities , but generally these jobs tend to be very poorly paid . 
  generally , when i hear `` there 's a shortage of [ profession ] '' , it means that there are n't enough skilled people willing to do that profession for the pay they 're offering . 
  it 's probably about the active workforce ( 18-64 ) , not the whole population . 
  i do n't know about other countries , but in romania , communism , despite its crimes , had some very positive changes ( at least until 1980 , when ceau\u0219escu started his [ insane austerity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s_austerity_policy_in_romania ) ) . 
  * pre-wwii romania was overwhelmingly rural . 
  85 % of the people lived in villages . 
  by 1990 , more than half lived in urban areas . 
  the 1930s were very tough times for the peasants : they had very low living standards and many of them were constantly in debt and were threatened eviction from their houses by the banks . 
  * almost half of the romanians were illiterate . 
  in just 10 years in the 1950s , romania officially stamped out illiteracy . 
  everyone who could n't read ( regardless of age ) had to take literacy classes . 
  * higher education was expensive and just 1 % of the population would complete higher education . 
  after the communists took over , it was free and they encouraged the working class children to follow it . 
  * in the 1930s-40s , romania had 15-20 % child mortality due to easily preventable diseases . 
  it was reduced by more than 90 % in just 10-20 years . 
  but let me tell you my family 's story : my grandfather was born in a poor fisherman 's family : eight people living in a two-room mud-brick hut on the danube 's shore , living off cornmeal polenta ( m\u0103m\u0103lig\u0103 ) with fried salted fish ( saramur\u0103 ) they fished from the lakes along the river . 
  he moved in bucharest in the 1940s and worked as a tailor and , after the communists came , he was able to lead a confortable enough life . 
  his two children ( my father and my aunt ) graduated higher education ( engineering , economic studies ) . 
  this would have definitely not been possible during the 1930s and even now it 's not possible to pay for a four-people family 's expenses and an apartment 's rent/mortgage with the median wage [ 200 $ -300 $ ] , let alone with a minimum wage [ 160 $ ] . 
  creating more languages ? 
  that 's like when you have 10 standards and you want to make another one to be universal : you then have 11 standards . 
  [ do n't mention the war !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xnnhzgcwtk ), 
  i thought it involves drinking large quantities of beer , eating duck and pork knee and being definitely not german . 
  * four months earlier , october 2012 : *  dutch prime minister mark rutte 's liberals agreed a coalition with the labour party on monday and vowed to follow a path of austerity . 
    `` we realize that this package will affect everyone in the netherlands , everyone will feel it , '' rutte told a press conference . 
  `` but we think it is necessary if our beautiful country is to emerge stronger from the crisis . '', 
  ( [ reuters ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/29/us-dutch-politics-idusbre89s0y520121029 ) ), 
  do n't let the horse know he 's going to die , which in practice means using a stun gun to make it lose consciousness before being killed . 
   the governments of the balkans countries are just trying to exploit the foreign investors the poor foreign investors . 
  they 're just trying to maximize their shareholder value and the big bad balakan governments would n't let them . 
   if the local politicians in albania and bulgaria point the finger on evil foreign corporations , they will divert attention from the real problems and corruption they 're causing . 
  when big foreign corporations bribe local politicians , those corporations are just as guilty as the local politicians . 
   no other investor will be willing to take that risk , seeing how corrupt and thieving the countries are . 
  if no investor is going to bribe politicians to get the utilities for next-to-nothing , it would be great for these countries . 
  foreign utility companies do like this : * they buy the utilities for very little money , usually by bribing local politicians . 
  * they increase the price with the approval of the government , which says that the eu 's common market laws require us to pay the `` real market prices '' ( which means the similar prices for utilities across the eu ) , even though the costs here are much lower ( due to our wages being 10 % of the ones in the west ) * they make no investment at all , not even the investment that is required by law , leading to worse services for the consumers * despite getting more money , they often have little to no profit because money is sent back to the country of origin as `` licensing fees '' , `` management fees '' , etc. 
  basically , we pay them money without getting anything in return . 
   those was true for czechia , hungary and all post-communist countries at all . 
  it stem from overall mistrust in other people . 
  why it has changed in some places faster than others ? 
  the median wage ( not average , but median ) in romania ( and presumably it 's the same in bulgaria ) is around 200 $ / month . 
  if your electricity bill grows by 30 $ , it 's a big deal . 
  what 's the median wage in czechia ? 
  a 30 $ increase in electricity bills is not a big deal for them . 
   the people 's mentality , which has been strongly formed during the communist years and that those foreign people who come to the country come to `` rape and pillage '' actually , the people are right . 
  those companies came here for profits , not for charity . 
  since they get a monopoly in electricity distribution , they can charge as much as the state allows them to charge . 
   since 2008 , in response to the economic downturn , most big european countries have cut defence spending by 10-15 per cent . 
  finally , we have come to our senses . 
  europe still has way too many soldiers . 
  maybe in wwi and wwii , the sheer number of soldiers mattered a bit , but now it 's pointless to have as many . 
  we do n't need two million soldiers . 
  we need to replace most of them with drones and a pact of not using drones except for self-defense . 
   the only difference between it being the private sector or the state the ones providing water is that one charges you directly and the other charges you more but through taxes . 
  i agree that most of the increases in the 5-times increase in the price of water after privatization are due to electricity increases ( also mandated by the eu ) and the decrease of subsidies , but nevertheless the local water company ( owned by veolia ) also gets each year hundreds of millions of euro in profits , at the same time as the rest of the economy is struggling . 
  same here , in bucharest , the local water company is owned by veolia ( france ) . 
  cuza never promised the church any financial assistance . 
  that 's a false claim by the church . 
  unfortunately , it wo n't . 
  for infrastructure , we could get the eu funds . 
  however , we do n't , because our politicians prefer to use local money for such `` investment '' , which can be siphoned into their pockets . 
  eu money tends to come with strings attached : the eu audits wo n't allow this blatant theft . 
  for extreme poverty , no one seems to care . 
  the government pays some social benefits worth 25 $ / person/month ( in some areas , they have to do some community work in order to get that money ) and the eu has a program of giving some free basic foodstuff ( flour , sugar , cooking oil , etc ) for them . 
  this helps them survive , but that 's it . 
  romanian media does n't seem to care , because many of the people in extreme poverty are roma/gypsies and racism is probably worse than anywhere in europe . 
  the arguments supporting no social programs tend to be along the lines of `` gypsy thieves deserve nothing better '' , `` lazy people '' or `` they should get a job '' , even though it 's obvious that in some areas , not even those 150 $ / month minimum wage jobs are available .

  it 's foreign troops who come here and engage in exercises with our military who are a bit behind and need an upgrade . 
  which is why they 're also sending us military equipment . 
  if you 're implying that they have their own interests in the area , i 'm not fighting you . 
  i know the us and west have their own interest here , which is to keep russia at bay , but we do n't mind it because keeping russia at bay means our security is good . 
  it 's not that we 're head over heels for the us or for foreign military presence on our territory , it 's that russia is a bigger threat to us . 
  and because we have a *** defensive *** missile shield at deveselu , russia has threatened us with a nuclear attack . 
  but it is n't like the shield is the only thing that made russia hostile towards us . 
  your politicians threaten us so often that nobody 's surprised anymore . 
  but i do n't get why you 're not happy . 
  seems that trump is more interested in having a close relationship with russia rather than his relationship with eastern europe . 
  i 'm also curious ... if we ask russia to leave ukraine and give them back their territory , will they ? 
   anti-gypsy eesti , do n't test me, 
  another map that has israel but not romania . 
  is this a secret plan to replace romania with israel ???? 
   why they are so afraid of ` possible ' russian invasion ? 
  because we know what a russian invasion looks like . 
   they are already occupied by foreign forces , we are n't occupied . 
  whatever foreign forces are present on our territory are here with our consent . 
   they are unable to quit international unions like eu or eurozone idk about eurozone , but you can leave eu whenever you want . 
  uk is leaving it if you have n't heard . 
   and basically they are bankrupts because their national economies live trough infusions from eu while local businesses are falling in decline . 
  well , i mean , even if i were to follow your logic , at least we have the eu to blame . 
  who 's to blame for russia 's economic failure ? 
   and they even voted for it . 
  that 's how democracies work . 
  see ? 
  this is the kind of solidarity that the west does n't have for the east . 
  i mean , hell , we were deep into nazi shit in ww2 and we still helped poland . 
  love y' all eastern neighbours . 
  except hungary of course . 
  makes my blood boil tbh, 
  that would make them just as bad as russia . 
   the worst we have to worry about is our economy top notch solidarity there mate, 
  well , apparently alde leaders do n't invest enough interest in their youth group so the youth group leader decided `` fuck it ! '', 
  and they all went to pnl . 
  i do n't know how this will affect alde and if it 'll still manage to get the 5 % for the parliamentary elections , but i doubt they 're breaking up . 
  can you link me up ? 
  i do n't know what you 're referring to . 
  are you referring to alde youth group from valcea quitting alde to join pnl ? 
  yet they were told by gingrich that us is n't sure they 'd risk nuclear war over them , who spend their 2 % . 
  imagine what the rest that do n't spend 2 % think when they hear such comments . 
  i do n't dislike that israel is here , but it annoys me because this is n't the only graph that does n't have certain eu countries included and i 'm :( bc i 'm a curious person, 
  israel is here , but romania is n't . 
   the fear here is that the united states is keen to see russia as a potential partner and reluctant to share the view in eastern europe that moscow presents a potent and immediate military threat . 
  i think that the fear we 're talking about here is whether or not usa would step in and how quick the west can move in case of something . 
  i 'd like to say that a russian move is unlikely , but i can not take it out of the realm of possibilities . 
  yes , they 're expected to have the majority , at the very least together with alde ( the alliance of liberals and democrats ) . 
  i really , really hope they do n't because they 're a corrupt , populist party . 
  the national liberals have corruption too , but they 're mostly incompetent and i , for one , believe that there 's still hope for someone to fix pnl , but not for the social democrats . 
  the problem is that the national liberals have a smaller electorate ( and they keep disappoint a part of their electorate with their stupid choices ) and usr ( save romania union ) is a new party with no chance to get a majority or , from what i heard , more than 13 % of the votes . 
   last time i checked referendums needed a 50 % turnout to be enforced . 
  did they changed it ? 
  not sure , i 'll have to look it up and come back to you , but some people over at / r/romania were talking about a 30 % turnout needed a while ago . 
  it 's a bit unclear to me too . 
  edit : you are probably right . 
  50 % is needed . 
  ciolos recently presented his platform for romania , a platform which he would like romania to respect and follow in order to progress . 
  afterwards he stated that any party who will respect this platform , with the exception of social democrats ( and parties alike i suppose ) , can nominate him as a pm . 
  for now , pnl ( national liberals ) and usr ( save romania union ) support dacian ciolos as a pm , but pnl wants him to be a political pm that represents the party , while usr said that they have no problem with him continuing to be an apolitical pm . 
   psd will win that 's a given . 
  the question is will they get a majority ? 
  wait ... winning implies a majority , does n't it ? 
   the referendum will fail . 
  we ca n't get 50 % turnout for parliamentary elections for goodness sake ... that 's true , but then again , you know how organized these people are . 
  and you know that , like with brexit , they are more likely to turn up to the referendum rather than those who oppose the redefinition . 
  and they need 30 % turnout from what i know . 
  of course , i wish for it to fail , but i 'm still concerned . 
  you have no idea . 
  from a personal point of view , i think it 's a show of power from this religiously motivated organization which supposedly gathered 3 million signatures for the referendum . 
  homophobia in romania is a big problem , but this would n't matter as much if initiatives like this would n't be supported by some political parties in exchange for votes . 
  which makes the fight against it so much harder . 
  tomorrow there 's a protest against this . 
  imagine that our civil code already states that marriage/family is between a man and a woman . 
  changing the constitution makes no sense . 
  besides , these initiatives have no place in secular states . 
  you 're right , sorry . 
  seems useful for anyone who wants to keep up with upcoming political events . 
  i see you 're romanian so you probably know already what 's happening here , but i 'll say it anyway . 
  - parliamentary elections - 11 december likely to win : the social democrats ( + alde ) . 
  the main opposition is the national liberals alongside with save romania union . 
  ~ ~ * may the force be with us . 
  * ~ ~ - a referendum on redefining the term `` marriage '' in the definition of a family in the constitution . 
  probably in april 2017 . 
  the referendum will ask if we want the definition to remain as it is ( '' ** the family is founded on the freely consented marriage of the spouses ** , their full equality , as well as the right and duty of the parents to ensure the upbringing , education and instruction of their children . '' ), 
  or if we want to change * spouses * to * between a man and woman * to * mainly * emphasize that same sex couples can not be a family . 
  bullshit brought up by a social organization that wants to protect the traditional family . 
  we 're with you , baltic states . 
  but on this topic , is anyone willing to summarize that `` in case of invasion '' lithuanian pamphlet ? 
  i 've seen the piece of news back when it happened , but did n't see the actual pamphlet . 
  did everyone receive it ? 
   and using a huge machine to suck out their happiness for collective redistribution i need a bag of happiness pls . 
  there , there . . we can have all these things at once , we do n't need to pick . 
  what are his chances against merkel ? 
   largest consumer of anti-depressants !, 
  if this is true than i am concerned \u0ca0_\u0ca0  better than sweden !, 
  ah yes , we all love the nordic banter, 
   canada works for me , they have ( in my mind ) that aura of large uninhabited territory to be explored , and it appeals to me . 
  that 's true . 
  by the way , i found a nice video from alberta , canada . 
  looks amazing .

  btw , i am not for redistribution of wealth , even the funds currently redistributed for infrastructure i do n't see as necessarily positive , as it encourages corruption and does n't incentivize market liberalization in the new member states . 
  governments are always going to be somewhat corrupt , the issue in the east is that the economy was pretty much `` planned '' , which means that people in power have more ways to control investments and resource allocation , thus there is more opportunity to take bribes and provide advantages to their interest groups . 
  i am one of the most pro-private business people you will meet around here . 
  but i believe a proper fiscal union would be a good thing for the eurozone ( not an economist , though ) , and would encourage the new members to strive to ascend to it . 
  i say impose a tough standard for ascension if it makes sense , but do n't stop the unification process . 
  i love these , really cool . 
   he saved pretty hungarian girls from the clutches of the enemy not the mingers , though . 
  they can have those , 
  you can take on a lot of debt  fight the power !, 
  compared to cee though , your economic strength is colossa . 
  romania has a gdp per capita of 55 % of the eu average . 
  i assume the netherland has considerably more than 100 % . 
  there is an issue with countries joining the euro zone with less than ( the calculations vary , but let 's say ) 80 % of eu average gdp . 
  but the issue exists without the fiscal union , which i am hoping will be achieved in the near to medium future . 
  she 's ... tall ? 
  has the mayor 's job description changed recently ? 
  yes , you summarized it perfectly  but they are allowed to nap after lunch , and it helps . 
  the uk rail is most of the time made up of replacement buses . 
  hehe, 
  if the us military does it , that makes it even more funny to see others in the comments calling it laziness . 
  did you work for a japanese company ? 
  they do this , and it makes sense . 
  i tried it as well , and it can be refreshing , if i did not drink a huge amount of coffee before lunch . 
  i like working late as well , and a little nap after lunch helps keep me going until late in the night . 
   i think the series tag has been misspelled . 
  i thought they made it so it translates in my language based on my flair , 
  you have a strange way of interpreting comments and your conversation seems misleading on purpose . 
  you are exaggerating my points and making it seem like i am suggesting events instead of analyzing positioning . 
  but this substitution is all of your own making , not mine . 
  you are describing the political situation . 
  i had in mind the military situation . 
  after annexing crimea , russia has invested a lot in their naval and air bases there , and even equipped their forces there with medium ranged iskander missiles , which are capable of being fitted with nuclear warheads ( not saying they have ) . 
  this changes drastically the balance of forces in the black sea , where there are already 2 semi-open conflicts ( russia/ukraine and russia/georgia ) , one strategic conflict ( russia/turkey ) and it is in close proximity to the syrian war . 
  the iskander missiles deployed in crimea can hit the entire romanian seaside , including the largest and most important black sea nato port - constanta . 
  the iskander missiles in crimea are also not vulnerable to the anti-misslie shield installed in romania . 
   ive heard we are buying antitank stuff next we [ already did ] ( http://www.romaniajournal.ro/romania-buys-antitank-weapons-worth-eur-110m-from-german-company/ ) , but it is possible we will be getting more . 
  i would prefer some newer mbts to be honest , but just because tanks are cool . 
   also a bit much to describe russia 's actions as ` antics ' when they are in their home waters . 
  they mean annexing crimea . 
  our pilots have gotten really good at parachuting  look at the bright side , we do n't want pussies in the air force . 
  my driving instructor used to say if i can drive his logan well , i would be incredible in a better car . 
  let 's hope it translates to flying . 
  well we are pretty poor , but you are right , due to our size we are the second largest economy in cee ( barely ) , so % of gdp would still allow us a better equipped military . 
  i doubt we are maintaining them , if they do n't lift off any more we go get another one from the warehouse , 
  nah , we even upgraded about 100 of them , 
  well , your mexican food is great  cheer up , dude . 
  we are waiting for an f-16 squadron from portugal ( they ca n't afford paying the bill due to budget cuts ) and i heard there are plans to get another squadron this or next year . 
  it seems like they are investing more in the navy for now , because of the crimea stuff and fears of russian aggressiveness in the black sea , as well as armored vehicles - in case the situation turns hot in transnistria . 
  the defense is going to 2 % of gdp starting in 2017 , so i expect more acquisitions . 
  we have a quite sizable force of mbts and airplanes , but they are all getting very old and starting to rust . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.hotnews.ro/zoom.html?desc=foto:%20fortele%20aeriene%20romane&amp;name=avioane%20f%2022%20raptor%20langa%20mig%2021%20lancer&amp;imgurl=http://media.hotnews.ro/media_server1/image-2016-04-25-20957516-41-avioane-22-raptor-langa-mig-21-lancer.jpg ) they are next to our mig 21 lancers , 
  the article is badly written . 
  they meant the full deployment to the continent , which is part of the european reassurance initiative , including the ones sent to lakenheath ( uk ) , germany and estonia . 
   next time vote social democrats . 
  the social democrats in my country are an evil party of corrupt ex-communists , and most of them are in jail or going to jail anyway . 
  and then there is juncker ... hard choice , i must admit . 
  come on , chin up man ... just kick out that moron orban and you will get back to proper growth . 
  sorry if you are an orban fan :p, 
   i am still waiting for the juncker plan . 
  haha , i am waiting for juncker to gtfo . 
  that 's my plan . 
  are there any steps that can be taken to end his mandate early ? 
   deutsche bank denied the claims in the lawsuit , saying in a statement monday : `` we disagree with the allegations and will be defending ourselves in court . '' pr speak for `` we did it , but believe we can win in court '' or `` we know we have to pay a fine , but we can fight for reduced compensation '' . 
  which one is it , though ? 
  i saw one !,

   honey [ foreigners dig romanian honey ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/foreigners-dig-romanian-honey-japanese-company-local-producer-apidavas-biggest-client/26778/ ), 
  germans on this sub are getting funnier every day . 
  keep it up mate , fight the stereotypes !, 
   the european security architecture , the established post-war rule that borders are not to be changed by military action , does not exist like it did before crimea . 
  i agree , and it is the reason ee ( well , mostly the ones who border russia right now ) are going insane . 
  but if they are gobbled up somehow , then new ones will become neighbors and so on . 
  the point is we can give a strong message right now , by helping the states who are in danger , and deter further aggression before it becomes the new world order . 
   they have nothing much we want which we can not buy way more cheaply than what an occupation would cost - both directly as well as in lost international reputation . 
  i am pretty sure it would start a war with many parties involved , it 's not just the lost reputation at stake . 
  because we do n't accept that kind of action any more . 
  the serbs did it in their own country , and still got bombed until they stopped . 
   to have international law , you need an international law-giver and an international law-enforcer . 
  we lack both . 
  i thought that 's what the security council was created for ? 
  ok , it 's not really working as designed , but at least there is intent . 
  good thing we are investing in our military , 
  diplomacy plays a more important role than military strength in this age , unless you happen to border russia or north korea ( or the like ) . 
  jellinek wrote his analysis before the world wars , a lot has changed since then in the civilized world . 
  austria has a weak military and is not in nato , but you have n't invaded them yet . 
  because we have international law that sane states abide by . 
   hungry , 
  right . 
  i agree . 
  who said they should be stationed in the baltics ? 
  it 's just a veiled threat to improve the negotiating position , they wo n't actually do it . 
   i was merely addressing a possible argument before it was made . 
  that the us is clamping down on travel . 
  nobody is making that argument , this is about a new eu decision and has nothing to do with the us decision . 
  again , this is only a way to increase leverage in negotiations for ttip , which would allow free trade , but not implement freedom of travel ** only in one direction ** ( from countries like romania which do not meet the visa waiver requirements ) .

  ukrainians are at the beginning , but the system itself is not bad and it can work , provided it stays free of outside influences . 
  it was more of a metaphor and less of an actual comparison . 
  thing is , the 1990s hit us really hard , and we 've struggled to recover for the better half of the 2000s . 
  our growth is still remarkable . 
  these types of posts , from romanians mind you , do n't do anything to repair our image abroad . 
  we should be celebrating our achievements , not criticizing everything . 
  the very fact that we 're able to have this discussion on here is a step forward from where we were in the 1980s . 
  dude , you 're literally the tunisia of europe . 
  like , literally , i ca n't tell marseille apart from tunis . 
  you have some , ahem , ahem , french individual blowing himself up every two hours . 
  i 'd go easy on the attacks if i were you . 
  we may be poor , but at least we have an identity . 
  my main issue is with you posting this here , like we do n't have a clean enough reputation already , 
  romania has been `` getting fixed '' for the last 26 years , with certain periods of stagnation sprinkled throughout . 
  fact is , we ... ca n't go any quicker . 
  a 5 % annual growth basically classifies our economy as a `` tiger '' . 
  we simply were extremely backwards , and that legacy ( or lack there of , really ) is hard to shake off . 
  we still have a good 20 years , if not more , until we 'll be able to say we 've caught up with the `` pack '' . 
  and even then , we 'll be behind the likes of germany . 
  we 're doing well currently ... we could be doing better , but we could be doing a lot , lot worse . 
  just look at ukraine for crying out loud . 
  they were above us by quite a bit in 1990 . 
  also , serbia . 
  and guess what ... there are still people like op who like to complain about everything . 
  people keep forgetting that we were n't always just mediocre easterners , we were fucking piss poor even for easterners . 
  the problem is lessening , albeit at a pace that 's getting slower and slower . 
  its effects are also seen mainly in the big urban centres . 
  there * are * areas in romania left behind completely . 
  the youth is either moving to the cities , or abroad . 
  localized growth makes sense in a capitalistic framework , since the state does n't plan anything from bucharest anymore , meaning jobs do n't get spread out . 
  we 've made incredible strides , it 's just that we were at the level of , say , ghana , in 1990 . 
  the fact that our gdp per capita is now in the same category as yours or hungary 's is remarkable . 
  the definition of `` poverty '' has changed a lot . 
  oh , please . 
  in the 1990s we were a third world country through and through ... the average wage was somewhere around 90 usd . 
  we 're getting there ... things are not great yet , but we 've made great strides . 
  shit like this only serves to damage our credibility abroad . 
  also , it 's important to note that the definition of `` poverty '' varies a lot . 
  a `` poor '' person today would be quite well off by the standards of 1993 . 
  it would seem that they are , yes . 
   i guess that people speaking multiple languages bothers you . 
  just like it bothered the french in the 19th century . 
  perhaps , but you did n't disprove any of them and i 'm not advocating for genocide . 
  you want me to give a point by point explanation of why i stand by what i said ? 
  i will , but i do n't think it 's necessary . 
  i like the way you spin it . 
  you should work for trump . 
  i 'm not lol . 
  it 's well known that all the balkan peoples are a cluster-fuck of genes from all sorts of different ancient ethnicities , which is completely understandable given the history of the region . 
  i was merely stating facts about france . 
  should i say it in arabic ? 
  perhaps you misunderstood me . 
  now they agree that the gypsies are not an usual minority . 
  their culture relies on isolating themselves from the rest of society , living by their own , archaic rules instead and coming up with ways to con the majority in order to profit from their naive idealism . 
  actually living alongside gypsies tends to do that , eh . 
  i mean , look at the western europeans , who used to act all patronizing , suggesting we treat them more humanely in the 90s , and now they mostly agree with our position about them . 
  yes , we 're all very similar in this region , but the french will soon be a minority in their own homeland , so that 's better , i suppose . 
  it 's not like france forcefully assimilated its minorities , like the occitans or the bretons , forcing them to adopt french language and deeming their actual , native languages `` dirty and peasant-like '' . 
  get off your fucking high horse . 
  oh , yeah , this 'll show those terrorists !, 
  forget about actually doing something ; project a flag on a building and you 're set !, 
  still not proving me wrong . 
  `` hurr durr you 're a nazi '' . 
  go live in ferentari if you love them so much and are oh so tolerant . 
  or do like che , go there as the intellectual , bohemian savior and rally them up against the evil state that does n't like them very much . 
  i do n't care . 
  i searched your post-history to see where you come from , since you do n't have a flair , but there 's no mention of it anywhere ... i 've seen that you frequent thebluepill , though , so i 'll just assume you 're a purple-haired hipster `` liberal '' from the west who 's never seen a gypsy in his/her life . 
  i 'll be more direct : as a pest . 
  like `` what did our ancestors do wrong for gypsies to settle here en-masse ? '' . 
  all they do is cause trouble . 
  if we know what 's good for us , never . 
  mad respect to all our bros over the prut , but we 're finally starting to see the results of our economic growth since 2000 and adding them into the mix would drag us back immensely . 
  we need another 15-20 years of continued 4 % yearly growth at least before we 'll be able to deal with incorporating moldova into romania . 
  at this rate , i think greece will be there before us . 
  we 're continually growing , mate . 
  nah , i prefer it up here . 
  can you see me , bulgaria ? 
  i 'd argue that during ceausescu 's era we could n't be considered third world ( shortages were due to his totalitarian frenzy rather than due to the economy itself ) , but that during the 90s , after the sharp decline of our gdp , hyper inflation , deindustrialisation , what have you , we were a third world country in every sense of the word . 
  i mean , 1997 net minimum wage was around 250 present day lei . 
  that 's ... abysmally low . 
  i guess what it means is that we 're in that grey area between the developed countries and the developing ones . 
  considering where we started , it 's an achievement . 
  i 'll show this graph to any romanian who says that the eu has done nothing but turn us into a source of cheap labor . 
  like , dude , look around you ... we 're certainly not `` rich '' , but we 're not third-world anymore . 
  a lot of that is due to our eu membership . 
  we 're also way less corrupt now than when we joined , politicians are actually sort of afraid to do bad stuff because they know the judiciary will actually do something if they do . 
  bottom line is : we might be the retards of the eu , the ass of all the jokes , but the eu * is * silently pushing us upwards . 
  are ... are we no longer a developing country now ? 
  dude ... we have a very high hdi ? 
  if i recall correctly , in the 90s , we were at , like , 0.690 . 
  it 's kinda impressive , but i bet this wo n't make the news , because we 're cynical as fuck as a nation . 
  for what it 's worth , last summer when i went to cluj for untold , i 've met some really cool hungarians who told me the same thing . 
  there * are * a lot of nationalists in hungary itself , though . 
  it 's such an ... unfortunate coincidence , is n't it ? 
  i mean , you live here , you know we are n't gypsies . 
  right ? 
  right ? 
  i was genuinely kidding . 
  i 've figured by now the dude is n't actually a hungarian `` veszen trianon '' nationalist . 
  true , main difference being that many hungarians glorify the crap out of that apartheid regime .

  it 's not that we are afraid of . 
  russia will not `` attack '' a nato member because they are not retarded . 
  but russian warfare is much more subtle . 
  i know the us will go to some length to stop a russian backed propaganda game in romania that would destabilize the country but i 'm not sure germany would be ready to denounce politicians in romania for being sold to the russians . 
  i do n't know how would germany react if a strong `` moldovan separatist and union with all moldova '' movement backed and financed by kremlin would develop in romania and destabilize the country and it 's only one example of what russia can do here . 
  except germans do n't sweep it under the rug ... 
  the prevalence of drugs here is much higher in romania than presented here but ana ( antidrug national agency ) is a perfect embodiment of the romanian government 's worst , useless agency that does nothing and pays a lot of salaries to guys who in turn hire their friends and relatives to do shit . 
  so there 's no real statistics or anything about the drug problem in romania which is incredibly concerning , no really because of the real prevalence of other drugs which is important but only in some urban centers but for the incredibly high alcohoolism level in this shitty country . 
  there are many institutions i would like to see reformed in romania but the guys at ana i would like to see shot in the fucking face , people die because of this shit . 
  the photos are quite dated , early 2000 's late 90 's imo . 
  england , i think the climate northern romania and romania in general it 's because we do n't have the waterway infrastructure of the 21 century : levees , dams stuff like that also deforestation and stupid village placements . 
  i heard of them in russia but in the eu , damn ... fuck this shit . 
  i really want to know if you have nk slaves here in romania . 
  i do n't want to offend any poles but imo the way you write in latin really shows it does n't really fit the language . 
  i do n't know much about polish so i do n't know if cyrillic would fit it but the fact that you could have only one symbol for sz \u017c cz szcz c m n \u0142 , l r , rz could maybe make it easier to read . 
  i spoke to some slovenes and they said that during yugo years when they were in the army everybody learned cyrillic because otherwise you were considered a dork ... now if you write in cyrillic in croatia or slovenia you 're literally milosevic . 
  wars are stupid . 
  is n't this the place where giant boulders can fuck up your house ? 
  same architect and style . 
  i think they were allowed to leave but left them stay if they wanted to show off how smooth their mooving is . 
  i ca n't believe how stupid would have looked if it collapsed and someone died , i have no idea why we were that retarded . 
  oh , do n't worry , we make a lot of things we are proud of ( wine , cheese , honey , jam , mineral water ) but we suck balls at exporting it in the eu . 
  for example i think borsec beats perrier in every aspect but because we suck at exporting it borsec can be bought in romania and sometimes hungary ( because it 's produced in the hungarian speaking region ) for 50 cents while perrier can be found even in japan for a lot more than 50 cents . 
  i think very few get welfare as they do n't speak the language of the countries they emigrate to and do n't bother with the paperwork ( a lot of them are illiterate ) . 
  even if i 'm happy that transylvania is represented correctly with a hungarian turul right now there is a silver aquila that does n't mean anything on it because who redesigned it in the 90 's was thinking `` fuck the hungarians and transylvania 's heritage i 'll go partially gheorghe funar on that coat of arms '', 
  of course not , without inflation their program is either impossible either giving romania a greek crisis . 
  luckly we have our own currency and i expect 2020 with 9 ron for a euro if everything goes according to plan which it wo n't . 
  their only argument against inflation is that they will rise small salaries that go directly into consumption because people are already to poor to save money but in classic psd style they fail to mention that a lot of our consumption is imported goods . 
  so if everything is fine and dandy , mister gheorghe will have a 3000 ron salary with the purchase power of let 's say , i guess somewhere around 1800 ron now ( adjusted for economic growth that we supposedly keep for all 4 years ) . 
  they will feel a bit richer , they will think they are much richer because nominally they have a 3 in front of their salary not a 1 and psd lives to govern another 4 years . 
  but i 'm a big optimist , i have no hope that everything will be fine for the next 4 years with the world economy . 
  and then we have to think a little bit more carefully about raising our government spending after 2008 . 
  we do n't have a strong economy with a lot of romanian capital . 
  we are extremely vulnerable to any change in the world economy . 
  dow jones is at record high , brexit is still an unknown economically speaking and the greek case is far from closed . 
  if any of these events will go bad we are back in 2010 only much worse because then we did n't cut taxes so much . 
  and what will they do then ? 
  cut shaiddeh pencil money ? 
  i do n't think so , dragnea 's power is concentrated in that pencil . 
  they will lie that the crisis does n't affect us and when the shit hits the fan they strategically retreat and let an idiot take all the blame ... like they did in '98 and 2009 . 
  said every european ... except for maybe the balkans . 
  i really hope fillon does n't pull a hillary with the corruption scandals and all that . 
  every european citizen has the right to vote in local elections in every european country . 
  is the 11th picture the orange guy from the restaurant in front of galata tower ? 
  i loved that guy , he 's huge . 
  last time i read wilson , the principle of self-determination was n't about planting muslims in the balkans . 
  what the actual fuck ... was the ottoman empire an american xxth century conspiracy ? 
  shit these guys are powerful , they can influence the fucking past as the us became a world player right after the ottoman empire was dismantled . 
  in cluj , romania , it 's meh . 
  it 's free for an hour ( max aprox 20 euros for a 24/h ) and that 's a plus and it 's still pretty new ( opened i think last year ) so the quality of the bikes is ok . 
  but it did n't open all the stations ( i hope it will be fixed when it opens again in march ) and the touchscreen on the stations is a shit piece of hardware that does n't work unless you break your finger and that sucks so much . 
  nice dacia you have there, 
  how strange , we love our diaspora in romania . 
  one of the reasons our current president won is because is counter-candidate , while prime-minister at the moment , tried to limit diaspora 's right to vote . 
  the fucking opposition let this happen . 
  instead of coming up with their own programs , talking to people about wages and pensions they let psd make an equivalence between higher pensions and anti-justice fighting . 
  it 's true , your alternative fact is so true . 
  it 's worse than being busy with helping crooks . 
  v ponta accepted a reward from dodon in december , the deputy pm has links to assad and russian propaganda sites are really helping them with the soros , brusel the bad and other such conspiracies to blame the bad foreigner and get their asses out of prison . 
  the crooks found in putin an ally , they are not willing to admit it because of public opinion but to me it 's the only logical conclusion . 
  the anticorruption push was clearly an american backed push because they saw in romanian corruption a strategic weakness of nato , putin is more than happy to help the crooks now . 
  i ` member . 
  yeah , because it 's 2004 . 
  it 's not about the huns which people agree they are not the hungarian 's ancestors . 
  it 's the theory which has been proven false that the magyars are originaly from mongolia . 
  is n't the simulator game mandatory ? 
  italy , greece and spain the fuck is wrong with you . 
  and how will you fix this ... so we can steal some solutions 20 years after you 've fixed it . 
  that 's a pretty shitty tupolev ... 
  i hope they usually watch social media . 
  it 's part of open sources https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open-source_intelligence, 
  and now what , am i supposed to enter in a conversation about the middle ages in europe compared to africa and asia , the renaissance and the lenlightenment and their causes , colonization and exploitation and other complex reasons and issues with a retatd like you . 
  i ai n't got the time for that mate , go and get triggered that people have a different skin pigmentation . 
  and the race of those who created it is important because ? 
  should people from the other race who are part of the western civilization assume some sort of inferior position because it was created by people who were white ? 
  why ca n't a black person be part of the `` western civilization '' ? 
  why , they have the no hills and mountains version in budapest , they should n't be that mad to this at least they made a backup . 
  i do n't know what to chose , one of them has a paint-roller blessing the other a folding cross ... securitate or kgb ? 
  tough choice . 
  people do n't convert ( because there 's almost no difference ) priests do . 
  bor expected that most of romanian speaking priests would come with their parishes to them in the 90 's , they did n't so now moldova it 's split but basically the same church the only difference is who they pray for ( kiril or daniel ), 
  but i think the majority of them know romanian to some extent . 
  these languages are very small . 
  but there are about a million l2 romanian hungarians in transylvania that are n't accounted for here , they are put in both hungarian and romanian statistics as being native in both . 
  i would n't let myself drive at 0.08 but it depends on the person . 
  i do n't get why you can have some alcohol in the blood and still be allowed to drive . 
  i do n't care how good of a drinker you are maybe you miss interpret how drunk you really are because ... you know , you 're drunk . 
  is n't soros giving a 30 zloty/dog and 50 zloty/human to protest ? 
  if he does do n't plan on that money , it has n't arrived yet for the romanians who were out in february . 
  beuf salata is best salata . 
  or , as we call it `` the toilet '' for around 40 % of romanians . 
  satu mare-mangalia in romania is 19:34 hours on the site and that 's without the obligatory several hours delay . 
  true also for the counter ( on proposals ) to be restarted and not trigger early elections all the parliament has to do is accept the 2nd proposal and then dismiss the new pm in 2 months like they did in 2012 . 
  and if you want to be a bad boy and get what pm you want you can simply impeach the president and nominate your pm during the interim . 
  after that the president can get back to power after the massive refendum and all that but he 's powerless towards the new pm . 
  sure they will get a hit but if they keep it low after setting the country on fire for the next 3 years romanians will forget like always . 
  but he can put who he wants as pm ... that 's the point of it . 
  it 's a replacement for the rheinmetall contract . 
  it will be produced in moreni too . 
  truth be told you ca n't produce an amv in romania in any other place because you do n't have the expertise and the infrastructure and it would cost too much to make it from scratch .

  all of the kings and emperors of the gypsies seem to be overweight . 
  - [ emperor iulian i ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/iulian_r%c4%83dulescu ) of the gypsies everywhere - [ king daniel i ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/daniel_cioab%c4%83 ) of the gypsies from romania - international [ king dorin i ] ( http://www.dorincioaba.ro/ ) of the gypsies - international [ king ilie i ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/ilie_badea_st%c4%83nescu ) of the christian gypsies everywhere no mustaches though . 
  : there might be others that i 'm not aware about . 
  well the majority of people would be against countries renouncing their independent foreign policy and national interests . 
  while this might have disadvantages as we can see in the poor coordination of this crisis , you ca n't just force this process and transfer all the powers to the eu level . 
  maybe it will happen eventually , but it 's clear that at the moment there is n't the political and popular will for such drastic changes . 
  and assuming again that you 're referring to the eu , i do n't agree that we `` congratulate ourselves over meaningless bullshit '' . 
  the eu has achieved great things , and i think that while it 's not the most influential international actor , it does benefit its members to be a part of it . 
  you do know there are multiple countries in europe with different foreign policies and interests , do n't you ? 
  hell , even russia is in europe ( partially ) . 
  belarus is in europe . 
  do you expect them to have an attitude even remotely similar to countries like poland or romania on this issue ? 
  of course not . 
  if you were talking about the eu , then yes , i agree that the overall reaction has been quite mild . 
  but there are a few things you should note . 
  first , we do n't have a unified military . 
  also , the us does n't depend nearly as much on trade with russia as some eu countries do . 
  therefore , the sanctions do n't affect your country as much as some of the countries that have been reluctant towards imposing further sanctions . 
  what i 'm saying is that you should take these things into consideration if you really wish to compare the us with europe . 
  i never said that the shooting was n't two-sided . 
  yes , there were some protesters with guns . 
  but the authorities should n't have started using guns , because that 's what led to this . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_people_killed_during_euromaidan ) 's a wikipedia page with references for almost all of the victims listed . 
  what does that have to do with this ? 
  also , the eu offered ukraine a deal . 
  is that wrong ? 
  why is n't it wrong that russia stuck its nose for more than 20 years in ukrainian politics ? 
  while yanukovych was democratically elected , that does n't mean that people ca n't protest against him . 
  and that 's what they 've been doing , until the authorities started using lethal force . 
  that 's when things got ugly . 
  yeah , it 's always the eu 's fault . 
  they also killed a hundred civilians and invaded crimea , right ? 
  i think that 's actually produced in the moldova region in romania . 
  the present-day republic of moldova ( sometimes called bessarabia ) and the romanian region called moldova together form the historical region of the principality of moldavia ( which also included the northern part of bukovina , as well as the southern budjak region ) , as it 's known in english and other languages . 
  in romanian , ` moldova ' can be used to refer to all three territorial entities . 
  but i can see how it 's confusing . 
  this is hardly news . 
  we know that there are extremists among the leading politicians of ukraine . 
  it 's just that this ca n't be used as an excuse for invading a sovereign country . 
  if they tried to commit genocide or other crimes against the population , then yes , that would constitute a reason to try to topple their government . 
  but this has not been the case . 
  here 's a list compiled by / u/regularjerk not so long ago . 
  it contains romanian phrasemes and their translation ( both literal and approximate ) . 
  i just added some diacritic marks and made a few minor corrections .

  is it so hard to just tell me ? 
  interesting . 
  i know that among the rebels there are terrorist groups , but i did n't expect that number . 
  do you have any sources to back that up ? 
  also , have there really been polls done during the war period that confirm what you just said , that assad is supported by the majority of syrians ? 
  and what exactly are they propagating ? 
  what do you need the gun for ? 
  i think they want to imitate the churches which usually have a cross on the roof ( or on the bell tower ) . 
  i 've seen gipsy houses with the dollar and euro symbols on top of their ` towers ' . 
  i view that as a collective trademark law and it seems fair . 
  are you also against trademark laws in general or just this particular kind ? 
  besides , there are similar laws even in the us . 
  my bad . 
  if it 's a poll it should be representative . 
  there 's no need to ask the entire population in order for it to be representative , as long as the sampling is done by taking into account the characteristics of the groups ( age , ethnicity , religion , social status , income , etc. ), 
  within the population . 
  he was just saying that there does n't seem to be any correlation between the revolution and this . 
  until you find who did it and why , you ca n't just be so sure that the ` revolutionaries ' did it and consequently discredit the whole euromaidan movement ( which is what the op is trying to do here ) . 
  without proof you could just as easily accuse the russians . 
   democracy has nothing to do with peoples fundamental rights . 
  it 's the exact opposite - ** they can be removed in a democratic way . 
  ** wrong , if that happens it 's called tyranny of the majority , which is not democratic . 
  but i do n't get it , why do n't you just move to north korea ? 
  the supreme leader will decide what 's good and what 's wrong , you wo n't have to worry about anything . 
  no , that 's not democracy . 
  because it goes against her rights . 
  see , democracy is n't only about being able to vote , but it also helps to protect peoples ' fundamental rights . 
  but it would all be better if one person gets to decide everything , would n't it ? 
   europe of freedom and democracy ( the least bad , because they are anti-eu , ** but sadly also democratic . 
  ** ) oh , so you prefer having no say at all in how things run in your country and in the union ? 
  but then , why do you even complain ? 
  why should anyone care about your opinion , especially those in power ? 
   `` global warming '' is a normal cycle , and happens every 800 years or so . 
  can you post links to at least 2-3 scientific studies that confirm that , or at least name such studies ? 
  oh , and some random fact about two armies hundreds of years ago is n't a source . 
  especially considering that global warming only started about 100 years ago . 
  i do n't think so . 
  if i remember correctly my geopolitics professor said that , as strange as it is , this book has n't been translated into english , even though it has an enormous impact on russia 's policies . 
  to be fair , the ukrainians are biased too . 
  after all , it 's their country we 're talking about . 
  however , i agree that / u/kistoul should provide some arguments to support the idea that crimea should join russia . 
  i know , that 's why i said that russia should n't have intervened militarily . 
  i think most of us agree that a referendum in crimea would be the best choice . 
  however , what most of us do n't agree with is russia 's military intervention and the total disrespect for ukrainian sovereignty reflected in their actions . 
  were n't yanukovych 's authorities the ones that started using lethal force against the protesters ? 
  if so , at that point , what do you expect people to do ? 
  go home ? 
  forget about it ?

  really , please any spaniard , tell me why does spain suck in your opinion ? 
  wizzair does fly there . 
  you can take a wizzair flight from lisbon to budapest and from then you take another one to kutaisi . 
  worth it, 
  i always had luck when flying to cdg although the 2e/2g transfer is not always easy and sometimes you do n't know when to get off . 
  out of the low cost airports , the milan bergamo one is pretty awful but so is beauvais . 
  life in general , the city is lively . 
  people are more easy to talk to than in any of the other three cities i listed . 
  it has good food , price is ok , it is beautiful yet surprising at all walks . 
  i would n't necessarily live there for other reasons but it is a nice , cheap place with nice people . 
  to be honest i would rather live in lviv than in krakow or vienna or nurnberg . 
  it is a matter of taste . 
  not the whole country is self-imploding , some parts are quite livable and i love a country that is not dull and is in continuous change . 
  the reason i would not choose ukraine is the language and the climate , otherwise i love ukraine so i do n't see 19 votes as a surprise . 
  yes , say goodbye to salar de uyuni in bolivia most likely :( . 
  that place is very rich in lithium for example . 
  and mr rubik erno still lives in buda . 
  he is alive ( not many people know that either ), 
  goodbye to gravity, 
  gave a nurse who was the sweetest nurse on our last day 50 lei ( 11 euro ) . 
  but she was genuinely caring and great and she pierced her ears as well ( not sure if that is mandatory by hospital ) . 
  and she bathed the baby every second day ( when she was on duty ) . 
  gave the anesthesiologist 200 lei but i found her only the second day after the surgery . 
  she reluctantly agreed . 
  later heard she was around all night and monitored my wife and the ( nice ) gypsy lady next to her at the icu ( first night after c-section you stay at the icu ) . 
  i tried to give something to the nurses at the icu but they gave me a death stare ( heard from others they wo n't accept anything , first experience at a hospital ... it was true ) . 
  gave a cleaning lady at the end 10 lei , should have given her more , she is on minimum wage most likely and she cheered up lots of people there . 
  very positive person overall , would greet her anytime on the street if i would see her . 
  gave the doctor who performed the c-section 1000 lei ( one week after the surgery at her private lab ) . 
  she behaved the same even though she did not know whether she will get something or not during the 5 day hospital stay . 
  gladly gave it especially that i know she donates a lot to a charity for single moms ( she always expensive eggs at the annual easter gala ) . 
  10 lei to some random asshole auxiliary staff who transported my wife to the icu . 
  should n't have gave it but i was in shock/amazement that i just saw my daughter two minutes before , but anyway . 
  paid around 460 lei or so for private room so me and a relative could stay overnight with my wife in the same room . 
  but i got a receipt for that . 
  i never paid that one and finished school more than 10 years ago . 
  but it is customary in more schools than it is not . 
  however , never heard of monthly class fund !, 
  i heard about a yearly one of 10-15 euro but never a monthly one !, 
  i believe you , i totally do , but it is the first time i hear about it and it is horrible . 
  same with us . 
  we paid 120 lei ( 26 eur ) per day for private room in a state hospital and it was a very pleasant experience with loving and caring nurses all around ( but i guess they treat differently pregnancies and newborns ) . 
  i do n't like romanian hospitals , in fact i think that the health system is far far from acceptable , but it is not nearly a death sentence . 
  i can afford to be hospitalized anywhere but we choose the state maternity in our 200k city to give birth to our daughter ( paid extra for a separate room so that i can sleep there - it was a c section ) and the service was very good . 
  much better than i expected , not perfect . 
  maybe a 8/10 . 
  sure , some hospitals have horrible conditions , and in some specializations like orthopedics i do n't trust how up to date doctors are ) . 
  but it is not a death sentence . 
  i admit there are worse cases than the one i experienced ( my mom had to go for a surgery in targu mures and it was bad ) . 
  private hospitals are quite cheap when compared to western hospitals but again , with some specializations i would go to another country . 
  dentists , ophthalmologists instead ? 
  best service and very cheap too !, 
  with universities i can only agree with !, 
  the best romanian universities ( cluj , bucharest ) would be average in western europe and the worse ones would not exist . 
  haha , he should bring pasta and pizza instead . 
  thanks for going through the numbers . 
  i was always curious about them but never bothered to check !, 
  and the award for the most off-topic comment goes to ... 
  not in eastern or southern europe , lol , no . 
  i heard about similar arrangements in australia or denmark though, 
  plus , mamma 's food is amazing !, 
  yes , it is often viewed like that . 
  it is not something particular to romanians as i heard plenty of hungarians or italians using the same word to describe their taxes ( did not meet many greeks or bulgarians but i think it is similar ) . 
  i think it has to do with the way people perceive public money is spent . 
  if the perception is that a large chunk of the taxes are siphoned through corrupt deals , the perception is that money is taken from one 's hands in the forms of taxes and put into some politicians ' pocket in the form of a corrupt deal . 
  then people are more reluctant to pay their taxes or see them as their duty . 
  thank you for your perspective . 
  it seems we like many similar things , out of all spanish food i also find paella to be overhyped . 
  it is true what you said about seafood and romanians and i am guilty of that . 
  the problem is you ca n't find fresh seafood here easily . 
  i want to visit maine especially for that but i will not until i have to apply for visas . 
  the thing about bars is true for cluj and bucharest especially , but in smaller cities that is less prevalent . 
  what i dislike about romanian cities is that there is no city with 500k-900k population ( a size i find ideal ) . 
  there is either bucharest or there is cluj , timisoara or iasi . 
  i think barcelona suffers from too much tourism and the bars did not have to have a special soul or theme to survive as the sheer number of visitors provided enough sales anyhow , especially in the touristy places . 
  this is a thing i also witnessed with budapest . 
  a few years ago there were lots of cool bars with lots of soul in it but as tourist arrivals increased , so did the number of standard pubs with tv 's and no decoration and bartenders with no prior experience . 
  but back to the comparison . 
  i think barcelona is way better in public transportation and infrastructure in general . 
  i would love to be in a city from where i could fly anytime to almost any destination . 
  while cluj airport is developing , it is nowhere comparable . 
  if you ever come back to cluj and want to head over for a weekend to oradea , you are my guest for a beer . 
  cheers, 
  as someone from romania who works remotely and considers moving to spain , i agree with many of your points but food ... really ? 
  i find spanish cuisine excellent and romanian mediocre . 
  also , spain might be back on track with growth , although i agree that the general sentiment is negative and people are more optimistic over here . 
  goes well with timisoara in romania just next to it . 
  they should have lots of programs together in 2021 ( timisoara will also be ecc in 2021 ) . 
  next year i want to visit anyway timisoara , szeged and novi sad for a few days each . 
  three beautiful and important cities for their respective countries . 
  you did not live in romania enough ... things will get screwed up at one point . 
  even if not , growth ca n't continue at this rate indefinitely without massive investments in education , research and innovation . 
  transition from a developing economy to a developed one is not easy . 
  it is impossible to have a sustained growth of 5-6 % a year without deep structural changes . 
  it does n't mean that the gap will not get closer , but growth is not arithmetical . 
  yes , they are more tabloid in nature , more vice-style . 
  i hope some other new online media outlets will open as nol had some good staff . 
  well , i was thinking some people will found something new like the guys who left index founded 444 ( not that i love 444 very much ) . 
  i will miss nol.hu , along with hvg and index it was my go-to newspaper . 
  the editorial board will migrate somewhere else , i am sure , but most likely they will not be able to launch a printed newspaper anymore .

  i know they were bombed because they were very important to the german war machine . 
  it was a goddamn sarcastic comment ... jesus . 
  refineries . 
  it was implied . 
   operation tidal wave was an air attack by bombers of the united states army air forces ( usaaf ) based in libya and southern italy on nine oil refineries around ploie\u0219ti , romania on 1 august 1943 , during world war ii . 
  meh , oil ... we have norway for that . 
  :p also , we used to have more oil too ... until the americans bombed it away . 
   and it 's also not that easy . 
  germany , whether we like it or not , is reliant on russian gas . 
  i 'm pretty sure many eastern countries need that gas , but they 're all trying to find other ways so they can get rid of this dependency on russia . 
  we 're trying too , although we 're a special case because we 're getting close to being self sufficient . 
  like i stated in my previous comment ... if we 're going to sanction them , we have to sanction them where they 'll really feel it . 
  but gas is their only real productive sector . 
  if you 're not going to hit them there , what 's the point ? 
  i now realize how stupid i am and how i read the second comma . 
  i 'm just going to delete this and go bury my head in a pillow in shame . 
  he said that psd/alde should solve the problem and solve it quickly . 
  he also said that `` this is what we were missing , another political crisis '' . 
  he 's done with their shit , so am i. 
  as if he 'd admit to anything . 
  and besides , i watched the interviews too . 
  he said that but then he dodged and said `` but think of the good things that came out of it '' or something along the lines . 
  i do n't live in a shit hole . 
  you 're so proud of your country you do n't even have a flair . 
  shitty opinion , shitty person . 
  business as usual . 
  corruption is one of the worst diseases a country can have . 
  it does n't take a year or two to get rid of it . 
  not sure what you mean , but psd will remain in power . 
  either this pm will stay in case the motion of no confidence fails , or he goes and the president has to name another pm from the coalition in power . 
  the president could perhaps call for snap elections , but psd will still win . 
  they have probably lost some voters , but i do n't think they lost enough to lose the election , especially since the opposition has been half asleep . 
  lots of things , but basically there were some internal fights in psd over various things and the ~ ~ supreme leader ~ ~ president of psd wanted to kick out his own government to put another one in place . 
  current pm says he wo n't resign until the president of the psd party does . 
  psd party leader obviously wo n't resign and has decided to start a motion of no confidence in the parliament next week to see whether the pm will be kicked out or not . 
  the most corrupt and biggest party in romania is fighting itself . 
  there are only 3 people left in the government because all the other members of the cabinet resigned , either out of will or because they were threatened to be kicked out of the party if they did n't . 
   yes , even we have to struggle with brussels bureaucrats . 
  take back control !, 
  and you say you 're not paid . 
  clearly we need to stop sending the # 350 million to the faceless eurocratic mods and invest the sum in memes . 
  i know you 're all just human beings , but the one creating problems is the automod blocking posts for no actual reason : relevant topic , respected source , etc. 
  but since there 's over 30 mods , i obviously imagine that there wo n't be as many problems with this . 
  hopefully there will be no more problems with waiting for posts to be approved . 
  you 're literally parroting what putin said . 
  oh , wow , yes , thanks germany for paying for the genocide you committed . 
  grand example . 
  germany should stop being so defensive about pumping money into russia like that . 
  `` threatens '' ... it seems she forgot that people in the east and the north have concerns over her plans . 
  it seems that instead of finding ways to be less and less dependent on russian gas , they want to pump even more money in russia 's only productive sector . 
  putin is pleased . 
  many ugly , ugly things were done in the name of `` national interest '' . 
  this . 
  anyone else and it would have been a shitshow . 
  it 's been open season on easterners for years . 
  `` pc '' does n't apply to us . 
   developing countries hosted the largest share of refugees ( 86 % by the end of 2014 , the highest figure in more than two decades ) ; the least developed countries alone provided asylum to 25 % of refugees worldwide . 
  same here . 
  better than before at least . 
  http://media.hotnews.ro/media_server1/image-2013-04-28-14708143-0-bloc-verde-banu-manta.jpg http://mediartv1.freenode.ro/image/201310/full/bloc-reabilitat-in-sectorul-1_88636300.jpg http://www.ps2.ro/www/ps2//media/media_20151029081309_979.jpg http://media.hotnews.ro/media_server1/image-2013-04-28-14707945-0-bloc-reabilitare.jpg, 
   why ? 
  maybe because we should be looking for solutions to pump less money into russia 's only productive sector , that 's why . 
  it 's a crime to deny a historical event that has affected an entire continent . 
  it helps create a precedent of erasing crimes against humanity . 
  ay , thanks for asking about us . 
  now , now , let 's not exaggerate and paint the whole thing as if the ee countries bring nothing to the table . 
  the western part of the eu does get a lot in return because of the sm , they profit a lot from the ee markets . 
  there is no such thing as free money . 
  it is being returned , just not in net payments yet . 
  putin himself in a recent interview ( oliver stone one ) has said that there was no document signed about this , which he thought was a mistake , so there is no binding agreement . 
  those were just words exchanged . 
  even if it was , russia does not decide for us . 
  we decide for us . 
  you mean cooperating with countries who agreed to join nato and helping with security ? 
  they 're not invading , we invited them here . 
  sorry , my country will not be once again considered russian controlled territory so we will put whatever equipment we want on our territory , whether russia likes it or not . 
  russia does not get to dictate what happens in the eastern countries . 
  ukraine was not in eu/nato , ukraine wanted closer relationships with eu , ukraine got its territory annexed . 
  russian foreign policy in a nutshell . 
  how did the us help the situation in europe ? 
  that 's interesting info . 
  thank you for sharing . 
  aiming to be independent of russian gas should be a priority for the eu . 
  eu is pumping money in russia 's only productive sector . 
   i just do n't want cold war 2.0 . 
  sorry to tell you , but cold war 2.0 has been here for a while . 
  even putin admitted to it . 
  they have been and continue to be a threat . 
  well , romania will suffer the least without it from this area . 
  actually we aim to be 100 % independent of it soon . 
  but i do n't know about the rest of you . 
  why would we be interested in good relations w moscow ? 
  they fucking annexed their neighbour 's land ffs . 
  russia is hardly a threat ? 
  especially coming from an easterner . 
  but your country is more rusophile so i was bound to meet one of you . 
  then we 're fucked . 
  there needs to be a way to go on without russian gas . 
  wow , guys , really ? 
  meh ... considering the amount of off topic posts there were about the uk elections . .

  the netherlands really dislike us for example . 
  the rest could be pursued in the end i guess . 
  i do n't know what 's the point of keeping us out . 
  i really do n't . 
  god , do you all know nothing about the agreements your countries are part of ? 
  schengen is mainly about the free movement of goods not people . 
  people are already free to move anywhere in the eu they want to , they just have to show their id at the schengen border and that 's that . 
  and i 'm sorry , but gypsies , from all eu countries , are eu citizens as well and have a right to the freedom of movement . 
  each country has the means to send them back if they do n't have a workplace after 3 months afaik . 
  schengen is not about the free movement of people mainly , we already have that , it 's not the biggest deal to show our ids at the border ( although it is annoying considering that we should n't have to do that by now ) and no one is making a big deal out of schengen for that . 
  schengen mainly affects the free movement of goods so we are at a disadvantage in the market . 
  one day ... * looks dramatically into the horizon *, 
   had to downsize the original target number from 160k to just 33k , meanwhile all the non-eligible people will remain stuck in italy and greece . 
  a source ? 
  have not heard of this . 
   at the same time the commission has not released a single information about how many migrants stay in their assigned countries , so we can all just rely on news reports which show that the relocated refugees are leaving basically every eastern european country . 
  i do n't think that many refugees who claimed asylum here in romania left . 
  most of them stayed and seem to be okay with it . 
  and if what you were saying was true , the number of refugees that have arrived in eastern countries initially would be down to below 50 % and i do n't think that 's the case . 
  even so , the problem is cooperation in making sure this works , not ditching it because it might not work . 
  of course many refugees want to go to a country that is better off , but that does n't mean they get to make that decision . 
  they have a right to protection , but not the right to choose where they get that protection so honestly , as long as the country they are relocated in is not seen as unfit to keep refugees , i could n't care less if they were to complain . 
  we all complain , it 's not a big deal , the authorities just need to make sure that they can implement a plan to keep refugees from fleeing as much as they can . 
  the eu * can not * close their borders to a refugee crisis of this size , that is not going to happen , forget that , so instead of saying `` we 're not going to help '' , your country could lobby for all sorts of ideas like `` what can be done in syria to stop this mad political game between the us and russia ? 
  how do we help syria in becoming relatively stable so that the refugees can go back asap ? '', 
  or `` how the hell do we make the americans take in some of the refugees since they 're one of the main countries at fault for this shitty situation ? '', 
  i agree , we should n't just let everyone in and we should double check who they are where they 're coming from to avoid economic migrants , but fact is , the refugees wo n't go away just because we want them to and we do n't have the legal right to turn away from the refugee crisis and pretend like it is n't happening . 
   `` we approached the schengen matter and we are exactly on the same vibe . 
  both bulgaria and romania have been prepared ever since 2011 from a technical stand , a fact certified by the european institutions , to access the schengen area . 
  it did n't happen because the schengen area is n't coordinated by the european institutions , but the approval of the member states is required , and here , there have been diverging opinions , '' the romanian head of state said . 
   in respect to the talks with merkel and macron , iohannis said that `` they both showed openness . ''  `` in this respect , we continue to be optimistic that we 'll be able to move further with the problem solved , in a reasonable amount of time , '' iohannis said . 
  afaik merkel told him to `` keep talking about it '' . 
  i guess what she means is pester everyone until they just finally give in , but i guess that wo n't work for the netherlands . 
  anyhow , it 's really annoying we are n't in it yet . 
  serbia is like that neighbour you do n't know much about , never speak to , but you have heard stories so you do n't try to interact too much either . 
  but no , little croatia , fear not . 
  we have other horizons we mean to sail to . 
  * smiles an evil smile at hungary *, 
  barbie ? 
   but it keeps shifting in a way that means we 're losing territory because it 's a bloody river that could n't care less about `` territory '' just recently i 've heard that we gained 6km territory because of it . 
  haha . 
   we are not the saviours of the world and it is not our responsobility to harbour everyone in a bad position in life . 
  no , but we do have * international * treaties that we need to follow regarding refugees . 
  by that logic , where migrants and refugees are being mixed , i call for poland to stop taking so many ukrainians in ... it 's not our problem after all . 
   migrants from war-torn countries that take the trip towards europe instead of the nearest country are not asylum seekers but economic migrants . 
  take a look at the statistics and see how many mena countries took migrants in and how many . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_refugee_population http://www.unhcr.org/news/videos/2017/2/58b3f4714/which-countries-host-the-most-refugeesquest.html, 
  have you ever thought that maybe everyone else is seeing things differently ? 
  greece and italy need help . 
  the vote was just for those around 150.000 refugees which need help and which have been checked and they are really refugees . 
  it 's not just the ec is it ? 
  it 's everyone else minus 4 . 
  close cooperation = / =  the more things ec hates but we have in common the better . 
  this sounds to me like `` i just want to see the ec burn no matter what '' which is ridiculous considering no one is forcing them to stay . 
  dude , read what he said in the reply . 
  it makes no sense whatsoever than proving it has a `` stick it to the man for no reason '' attitude . 
  he wants his country to leave the eu so he wants more things to disagree with ec on so maybe it 'll trigger czechia to leave . 
  i only described what he said . 
  no , you 're obviously dissing every other society which does n't stand for that and deem it as immature . 
  then all i can say is good luck . 
  you will definitely need it . 
   migrant quotas which are un-implementable without locking western-bound masses in giant camps ; dude . 
  i do n't care . 
  the vote won , you 're not abiding by it , you get sanctioned . 
  we have been sanctioned before for things we did n't abide by and no one created a circus because they were right to sanction us . 
  if everyone else can do the whole refugee thing , so can you . 
  also , did i propose something wrong ? 
  i just told you there 's a way to get rid of the pesky ec altogether . 
  yeah . 
  i bet i 'm being submissive by not having a `` stick it to the man for no reason '' attitude . 
  ah , the v4 mentality never ceases to amaze me . 
  if that 's the principle you want to work on , why not just quit altogether ? 
  you wo n't have to deal with the ec at all if you quit . 
  i 'm sure you 'll be an amazing country ( something the ec is obviously trying to keep you from ) once you 're on your own . 
  no , thanks . 
   this is the way to mature society . 
  yeah , czechia will show everyone else just how bad their society is because they do n't have guns . 
  it does happen . 
  look it up on google . 
  an example : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/gang-accused-of-smuggling-terrifying-arsenal-of-guns-to-uk-a6903801.html, 
   that is in situations when you 're trying to stop an ogoing criminal act which is not necessarily directed against you ( i.e. 
  shooting a terrorist ) , will now be legal . 
  yeah , i 'm pretty sure that will work out great . 
  as if shady shit is n't going to happen when no one watches the border . 
  that does not answer my question at all . 
  well it was low until now and that worked out , right ? 
  why fix something that 's not broken ? 
  and i 'm not sure about civilians being able to handle those situations . 
  many things can happen . 
  it is much more easier to kill someone with a gun than with a knife . 
  the knife is so much more personal while with the gun you just pull the trigger and that 's that . 
  and while czechia has made it legal to just give people guns , other countries have different laws . 
  how does czechia plan to keep their guns inside their country ? 
  yeah , i 'm not a fan of civilians with guns . 
  everyone 's saying crime is super low in czechia so why is this so needed ? 
  stop talking shit . 
  if there 's such a thing as / r/mapswithoutnz there should be a / r/europeanstatisticswithoutro . 
  i 've seen numerous statistics lately that do n't include us . 
  and sure , some might be irrelevant in case of romania , but some were really interesting . 
  :( that being said , austria is not pleased at all .

  i doubt there would actually be that much noise unless you 'd have 3 + people like that in close proximity . 
  it would just be stupid/ridiculous . 
  the thing to remember is ringing phones are n't that loud , they 're not megaphones . 
  they are about human chatter volume so it 'd be lke 1 in 10 people speaking as far as anyone sleeping would be concerned :p, 
  because people ca n't use vibrate for certain numbers ? 
  because people are too retarded to know how clocks work and ca n't reach a certain place at a certain hour ? 
  yes , we have clocks , radios and cellphones with alarms and calendars now . 
  no need to wake up others with your religious shit . 
  i mean wtf this is not the middle ages anymore, 
  best part is you can have a mandatory check up at whatever age . 
  if parents fuck up they go to prison for mutilating a child . 
  do this to a few , put it in the media enougj , problem stops, 
  agreed as if the degree of mutilation matters . 
  it must be stopped ffs , that 's what matters . 
  but fgm is worse is just retarded . 
  who the fuck cares , it 's fucking mutilation . 
  people man i swear, 
  past tense, 
  how is that fundamentally against german culture ? 
  nobody expects full integration but enough to fit in general . 
  so no death to jews shit and all that, 
  i really really hate the pc everyone is a special snowflake and criminals are just misunderstood saints bs . 
  i mean ffs just recently you have that 15 year old in sweden who killed someone and got no prison, 
  it wo n't unless france helps and i do n't see that happening . 
  if he was in romania he 'd be fucked though, 
  modern equality . 
  france did that . 
  they got the first bus back to france and kept at least 300 euros each, 
  sadly most people believe as you did and then blame easterners for not being accepting and all that . 
  it 's really sad knowing it is n't so and people in eastern europe can be quite friendly in a lot of cases, 
  well of course it 's the same . 
  we all know it ( eastern europeans ) but those holier than thou assholes who ca n't deal with a 10th of our gypsy population find it really easy to preach to us barbarians about taking care of the rroma . 
  fucking hypocrites , i swear this pisses me off to no end . 
  if other countries had n't done that shit i mentioned above and integrated them i 'd agree , we are barbarians , we can do more . 
  but they sent them back and did n't do shit . 
  what a joke . 
  do the french remember sending them back to romania ? 
  the swedes telling us to integrate them and now failing miserably themselves with a mjch smaller number ? 
  it 's really easy to say do this and that when the gypsies are not in your country btw they 'd wreck any new accomodation , it happened before in romania, 
  in spite of our politicians . 
  they are trying really hard to stop this, 
  poland can not into space . 
  to fly is a zbura, 
  for minor offences sure . 
  i doubt murderers are treated that well but that part of the world is pussolified beyond belief : /, 
  prison pretty much sucks . 
  it 's the confinement that gets to you . 
  no idea if you ever lived in a really `` closed '' sort of place with not much to do . 
  it 's a special kind of torture, 
  or lock them for a couple decades . 
  you take a life by intent you forfeit yours, 
  if it comes to pushing it 's justified, 
  just to be early ? 
  that 's it , no vork for you . 
  better in time than early . 
  also , again , why were you one minute early ? 
  nice try . 
  why are you one minute early bro ? 
  what if i am waiting at the door ? 
  why are you a minute early ? 
  they breed faster than they die . 
  they breed a lot, 
  correctly it seems . 
  they also check for ball size, 
  people are greedy, 
  yep , they were scammed lol, 
  they demand their olllld stuff here too . 
  same story i guess, 
  oh well shit happens . 
  let 's hope they fix it fast at least hue hue, 
  swedes are so easy to abuse lol, 
  he could merely be a stupid cunt and have no agenda , no need to deal in absolutes, 
  i remember as a child hearing the name and being like wtf . 
  nobody wants to be fed shit . 
  i much prefer the english name, 
  so the vatican is for abortions when it comes to pregnant minors ? 
  hue hue hue, 
  he ca n't invade , his economy is shit , he can only threathen, 
  i need to go visit greece, 
  yes , russia has every right to be in syria , not in turkish air space, 
  it 's cause you are turkish and againt the ruling i think, 
  a torture device is what now ? 
  agreed but that could change . 
  people are obviously not happy after the recent attacks . 
  reasonable posts are still upvoted a lot of the time , for example about the two dead girls , quite a few people did not hate them and were well up in karma ( on worldnewz , which is considered worse ), 
  and that 's their problem . 
  not all of us do that, 
  there are no right subs/bad subs for discussion , unless you go saying how wonderful children are on subs like cf or something like that . 
  this is about europe and european stuff , most opinions are quite welcome , even if the majority holds a belief or another, 
  quadruple amen . 
  winter is coming !, 
  that burn, 
  natural selection . 
  literally too dumb to live, 
  her friend convinced her . 
  also , she was a new level of stupid, 
  why would any woman support them ? 
  i mean ffs as a man you are treated like a baby/god compared to a woman so if you 're an ahole that 's understandable in a sick way but to be a woman and support this ... 
  hey , some people are into that sort of shit , do n't judge, 
  is that a joke ?

  the man told police officers that he wanted to meet the european president , prosecutors said . '', 
  source : http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/02/us-belgium-security-iduskbn0l61ir20150202, 
  you raise some fair points . 
  i would rather like the whole alliance ( nato ) to buy them and use them as common assets . 
  nato already has awacs airplanes , why not do a collective effort and solve this issue together ? 
  first , the unification will not happen anytime soon . 
  if it were to happen it will happen without transnistria . 
  that is pretty clear . 
  meaning that if the republic of moldova will decide to unite with romania , a solution would need to be found for transnistria . 
  either ` independence ' ( = controlled by russia ) or inclusion into ukraine , which would be very difficult as well given the very pro-russian feelings in transnistria . 
  even gagauzia has legally obtained the right of secession in case the republic of moldova unites with romania , and they are more or less under the control of the chisinau authorities . 
  so imagine transnistria ... 
  historically , romania 's borders have stopped at the dniester/nistru river , the only exception being a short period during wwii , so transnistria is not considered historic romanian land and romania would not fight for it no matter what other people here would say . 
  to continue the title , it was a romanian bus registered in bulgaria :-) and indeed slovakia , what 's up with these people ? 
  if the eurosceptic parties would have a majority in the ep , then many things would be different . 
  i think you are focusing on the military aspect of it , which is indeed limited , whereas i 'm talking about the political significance of the visit . 
  i do n't think that what the chinese did is impressive , i know that most countries with a reasonable navy can travel all around the world . 
  of course russia never was fully isolated , but it 's not like international relations are judged at a single moment in time , they are constantly evolving and gestures such as this have their political significance that goes beyond their military one . 
  china 's position , which is one of the 5 permanent members of the security council , does matter , including in such high-politics issues like the conquest & annexation of territories . 
  i do n't think the issue is that china does something illegal . 
  like you mention , they are free to move their ships around . 
  but the visit itself is not without political significance . 
  the ships are entering the black sea , where russia just acquired a large piece of territory , basically the central peninsula which allows them to project power over the whole sea and surrounding areas . 
  china has n't recognized the annexation of crimea but it has defended russia on several occasions on this topic and now sends its ships some tens of km away from crimea , the biggest piece of land that was forcefully occupied and annexed by another state in the last years . 
  this shows political support for russia , it signals to russia and to the other states ( especially the west ) that moscow is not isolated , that it has friends/allies that can project military power even in europe ( black sea ) . 
  so i would not agree that this is much ado about nothing . 
  moreover , the black sea is not like the atlantic or the pacific , or even the mediterranean , where ships pass by every day ; it is an almost closed sea where the access of foreign military ships is quite strictly regulated by the montreux convention so visits by foreign military ships are more significant than in other places . 
  yes , he is fooling around with the translations . 
  c'mon fellow romanian redditors , stop sharing useless pieces of ` news ' on / r/europe . 
  share stuff relevant for everybody . 
  this one is n't even relevant for romanians . 
  just for the record , here is another romanian who agrees with you and an upvote . 
  glad to see the document but , given that it 's in romanian , it is n't much useful for the other users of / r/europe ( save some of our italian cousins ) and would better fit in / r/romania, 
  they will go on the existing roads . 
  their quality is uneven but it has overall visibly improved in the last decade . 
  well , it was n't exactly something charles wanted . 
  from the wiki of basarab i http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basarab_i_of_wallachia `` a royal charter issued on 26 july 1324 is the first document to reference basarab . 
  according to the charter , he was subject to charles i of hungary as the voivode of wallachia . 
  basarab became `` disloyal to the holy crown of hungary '' in 1325 . 
  he seized the banate of severin and raided the southern regions of the kingdom of hungary . 
  basarab supported michael shishman of bulgaria 's attack against serbia , but their united armies were defeated in the battle of velbazhd on 28 july 1330 . 
  soon after , charles i of hungary invaded wallachia , but the wallachians ambushed and almost annihilated the royal troops in the battle of posada , which occurred between 9 and 12 november 1330 . 
  the battle of posada ended hungarian suzerainty in wallachia , and the first independent romanian principality was consequently founded . 
  basarab 's descendants ruled wallachia for centuries . '', 
  they exist in greece , macedonia , albania and serbia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aromanians, 
  just passing through , do n't mind me . 
  yes , we are . 
  btw , romania is playing a similar ` game ' . 
  today , the president referred to the `` historic tragedy of the armenian '' , the `` tragic events '' , the `` terrible crime '' , the `` tragedy '' , the `` historic tragedy '' , just not saying that `` genocide '' word . 
  his statement ( in romanian ) here http://www.presidency.ro/?_rid=det&amp;tb=date&amp;id=15650&amp;_prid=lazi, 
  truth be told , for ( too ) many in moldova 's political class , it is a pleasure . 
  c'mon , he raises a fair point . 
  let 's not start arguing over this . 
  it 's certainly not worth it . 
  sure , just wanted to show that there are other animals in the city , besides humans . 
  and more !, 
  romania 's constitution was also based on the belgian one . 
  the fact that your constitution served as a model for other countries is no small thing . 
   winnable nuclear war . 
  is there such a think as a winnable nuclear war between the us and russia ? 
  nah , you already have a longer coastline than we do . 
  that 's a very ambitious map . 
  control of tajikistan allowed them an even bigger foothold into central asia and control over around 5 million people . 
  not everything is measured in gdp and gdp/capita and you do n't see states giving up their poorer regions . 
  i agree that developing an anti-missile shield one undermines mad but given the reduced number of interceptors/small size of the shield , and russia 's nuclear capabilities , including slbm which would be extremely difficult to protect against , this does n't really change anything . 
  the missile shield would at best be able to offer protection against several tens of missiles whereas russia has thousands of them . 
  the us would not launch a nuclear war that would end life on earth and , in any case , would not be able to hit russia 's mobile icbms or slbm-carrying submarines . 
  i mentioned the fact that the nato anti-missile shield does n't have explosives on the rockets to emphasize its defensive character . 
  you ca n't attack with them , just shoot what 's coming towards you . 
  the rest of your comment does n't address what i said . 
  my point is that the nato missile shield is intended to defend the alliance , croatia included , against an attack from a power with a reduced number of missiles , such as iran . 
  it offers extremely reduced protection against what the russian have . 
  you can also say that shields practical use is that it offers protection against states with limited icbm capability , like iran , thus not russia , and that this is the declared purpose of the shield . 
  the s-300 , s-400 , actually have explosives on them , the missiles of the nato anti-missile shield do n't . 
  have you read the piece before commenting ? 
  there is nothing controversial there , and no rewriting of history . 
  this is not about who sacrificed/contributed the most in ww2 , but about the time when the soviet union was invading countries , murdering and deporting people . 
  `` neither poland , nor romania or any of the baltic states were important for them '' well , they were important enough to want to conquer their territories . 
   hyper sharp sense of what 's realistic i confirm that i do have a hyper sharp sense of what 's realistic . 
  seriously though , russia and putin does n't have the resources ( military , financial , support of the population etc ) to take over the whole south of ukraine and will not try it . 
  even less likely to engage in conflict with nato . 
  the soviet union did n't do it and that state was much stronger that russia is now . 
  the risks would be too high and putin knows it . 
  at the same time , i certainly do no support complacency . 
  i think the west should be much more serious about pressuring putin ( politically , economically , militarily ) to give up his revanchist plans . 
  what a crappy message this title and article sends . 
  not so fun . 
  they also say that the driver is in a serious medical condition . 
  listen , i am happy to engage in dialogue as long as it takes place at certain level . 
  your are just lowering that level by emitting false , exaggerated and clearly biased opinions . 
  so i will leave this conversation . 
  as far as i read , most companies are happy about the anti-corruption work as they will now have a chance to compete on equal terms for public contracts/tenders . 
  getting rid of corruption should increase confidence in the market . 
  public officials should respect the law and take the decisions they need to take . 
  it 's not that public officials get arrested for nothing . 
  in the cases that get in the media the corruption was very clear ( audio/video recordings , money that they received and ca n't explain the source , witnesses etc. 
  what a moron . 
  he also says that romania wants to invade moldova and other stupid things . 
  http://www.lucmichel.net/2015/03/31/eode-press-office-geopolitique-la-roumanie-transformee-par-lotan-en-plate-forme-dagression-contre-la-russie/ there are several articles in the romanian/moldovan media about this . 
  honestly , i do n't understand why a marginal neo-nazi gets so much press coverage for saying stupid things .

  austerity works if you actually make the necessary reforms instead of dragging your feet for years . 
  regardless greece will get their debt haircuts , once that happens . 
  austerity was the only solution , that 's the problem . 
  you ca n't invest massively into the economy when you have no money . 
  other eu countries are unwilling to subsidize greece without reforms taking place first . 
  reforms will only happen under the guise of austerity , simply giving greece money means they will never implement reforms , and why should they ? 
  it 's a win-win for them . 
  no , they could n't have done that from the start , because at that point greece 's economy was wholly unsustainable and inflated . 
  reforms were and are needed , and if greece would have gotten the debt haircut from the very beginning , they would not have done shit about reforms later . 
  then you would 've ended up in a situation where you either go down the road we 're currently on , or the eu subsidizes the greek economy . 
  let 's face it , the the rest of the eu would 've never agreed to that . 
  the only scenario that could really work and what will probably end up happening , is the eu giving greece massive debt haircuts once the reforms are in place . 
  that way you can actually solve both of the issues . 
  unfortunately the greek government has been stalling for years , which is partly why they are still in this situation . 
  it 's fun to blame the eu or germany for everything , but things are not as simple as you seem to think . 
  as for the eu as a whole subsidizing the economies of other countries , that can only work with a real political and economical union . 
  there are opposite reasons because italy and greece pushed for refugee quotas since they ca n't handle all of them , while the rest hate the eu for imposing the quotas . 
  that 's what he meant , i 'm pretty sure . 
  so you see , everyone is unhappy for opposite reasons . 
  some people want one thing and the others want another thing and they all are unwilling to compromise . 
  although honestly in this situation italy and greece is n't in a position to compromise , it 's up to the rest of the member states to do it , but some countries wish to take absolutely no part and they are unwilling to show the tiniest bit of solidarity . 
  echr is respected by countries . 
  but that is beside the point . 
  people act like the refugee quota was a bad idea , but it was voted in by member states , yet `` eu '' is to blame right ? 
  the whole argument is ridiculous anyway . 
  people say that countries should not be forced , but if there is no solidarity , then who except germany would even want to take them in ? 
  probably nobody . 
  they would all remain in greece and italy , the two worst hit countries by the global recession . 
  how is that a solution ? 
  it is n't . 
  people just do n't want to see refugees in their backyards , they 're fine with all of them being stuck and creating too big of a burden on their neighbor states . 
  strong gdp growth = still being far far below western europe where most people emigrate . 
  the trend will only start reversing when convergence rates to the eu average approach 100 % . 
  that 's not true . 
  most people definitely do n't want poland to leave . 
  you 're thinking about a small vocal minority maybe . 
  that minority probably also wants romania , bulgaria to leave . 
  but that 's just due to xenophobia mostly . 
  let 's break down your argument . 
   dude , that 's the problem . 
  `` modern '' democracy is about lobby , money , etc not the people who should be in center of the system ; first you say that modern democracy is not about the people , implying there 's an older version of democracy that was closer to that ideal . 
  this is n't really an argument , it 's populism . 
  can you point me to that magical time when lobby and money did n't play a part in politics ? 
  in fact i would argue that until recently people had even less power , since less than 100 years ago half the population could n't even vote . 
  go back even further and you 'll see that only a quarter or less of the population could vote . 
  was that democracy more real somehow ? 
  how exactly is modern democracy `` worse '' . 
  not to mention the fact that equality of citizens in front of the law and the rule of law have been leading principles of democracy since the french revolution . 
  you seem to be under the impression that those principles have eroded over time , when in fact they got more strengthened in time . 
  only in the last few decades have those principles started to exist closer to their meaning , instead of meaning `` equality for all citizens , except ... gay 's , women , jews , gypsies , peasants '' and so on . 
  your second argument , i 'm not even sure what it is supposed to accomplish . 
  you 're nitpicking over the fact that there 's more principles than the ones i listed , which only supports my initial argument that democracy is more than just elections . 
  so thanks ? 
  not to mention that your argument is based on an appeal to authority , which is laughable in itself , because you 're basically arguing that the authority prof. bianca gu\u021ban is somehow more relevant than that of larry diamond , a leading political scientist that teaches at stanford university . 
  as for your 2 ` nd post . 
  i 'll translate for the lazy . 
  the guy thinks he won the argument because i have n't replied to his reddit post in under an hour . 
  you seriously sound insane . 
  people have lives . 
  people have better shit to do than to immediately respond to your irrational drivel . 
  show a little patience , maybe you 'll end up learning something . 
  according to political scientist larry diamond , democracy consists of four key elements : ( a ) a political system for choosing and replacing the government through free and fair elections ; ( b ) the active participation of the people , as citizens , in politics and civic life ; ( c ) protection of the human rights of all citizens , and ( d ) a rule of law , in which the laws and procedures apply equally to all citizens . 
  [ 4 ] so no , not just me . 
  modern democracy is more than just elections . 
  equality in front of the law and the rule of law are seen as pillars of democracy . 
  democracy is more than what some people , even a majority , believe . 
  in democracy it is vital that the rights of minorities are upheld and citizens are equal , otherwise you quickly slide into a tyranny of the majority, 
  there arent good arguments for why those things are bad for society . 
  plenty of arguments for why they are actually good . 
  plus you always have to consider the rights of an individual vs general interest . 
  if you are strongly limiting a right of an individual , the reason better be good . 
  moral religious reasons are definitely not good , since in democracies there exists this thing called freedom of religion , so restricting the rights of minorities because your religion says so is quite medieval . 
  no , it was only due to racism . 
  much better . 
  so just ngo 's . 
  got it . 
  so what are the evil actions of these ngo 's , do you even have any idea or are you just repeating non-sense you read elsewhere ? 
  most of them are just fighting for democracy and free press . 
  it 's a non-argument because it implies an impossible solution : africa should n't develop at all , green energy or not . 
  so unless you 're proposing we forcefully keep africa pre-industrialized just so we can pollute more than our share , than yes , it is a non-argument . 
  the current rapid climate change is due to the massive amounts of pollution from the rest of the world . 
  climate change will not stop unless the developed world cuts its emissions back considerably . 
  so the problem is n't africa installing solar panels , it 's us . 
  in absolute terms africa will add to emissions , but the only real world solution is for everyone to only pollute their fair share . 
  any human activity causes pollution . 
  simply existing causes pollution . 
  it 's a non-argument . 
  there 's plenty of things to worry about , but that is not a good reason to keep africa underdeveloped and poor as fuck . 
  with the knowledge and technology we have today , africa can do it better than the west or asia did when they themselves industrialized . 
  pretty much , yes . 
  i guess that is one advantage of developing later . 
  you can skip a few steps . 
  the advantage today is that green technology is advanced enough so countries can invest directly into that instead of going through the regular phase of coal power and then green energy . 
  and you know , africa does have a shitload of sunlight . 
  solar panels would work great there . 
  i was n't going for perfect accuracy in a single sentence . 
  it 's not like the nazis were full on socialist , but they did have plenty of social programs . 
  the point is that the far right does n't mean free reign capitalism , it 's associated with other elements which distinguish it from most other ideologies . 
  far right has shit all to do with economic policies . 
  the nazis were far right , yet they were very keen on implementing social programs for the native germans , in fact , their very name should clue you in , national socialism .

after 100 hours of europa universalis 3 i can name more extinct countries than existing countries . 
  did n't even know something like this exists . 
  this is totally surprising ... not . 
  i 'm not british , but i would go to a british centralised site that blocks americans . 
  what is the cause of this protest and what are you trying to accomplish by it , first time hearing about bulgarian protests . 
  as if we did n't hate the americans enough . 
  they occupied half of cyprus , they have jailed the most journalists , we have a lot of words from turkish . 
  i though men of war was made in russia . 
  i 'm pretty sure the number of italians leaving would be replaced by immigrants . 
  so you mean the whites are the same as blacks and yellows ? 
  stolen . 
  mostly from illegal activity , from begging to organized crime . 
  i noticed one that had a green euro sing . 
  me neither , i did n't knew there was a georgia state . 
  i was wondering why americans post so much about georgia . 
  every time i turn on the radio they give us some warning about not travelling to malaysia . 
  than why do i have a cousin working in uk ? 
  but it feels so badass to do the roman salute , it sucks that it got ruined by the nazis and the winners of ww2 . 
  did i say it was anything else ? 
  seriously ? 
  a life ban for the roman salute ? 
  wtf is wrong with this world ? 
  it 's hard to read everything on that type of graph and i did n't expect russia to be that low . 
  our family got biscuits too , but our total income is more than the average . 
  weird . 
  and no russia . 
  romania - land of the romans . 
  just because there are fewer gay bars in transylvania it does n't mean the people are less open to gay people . 
  not all romania is the same , transylvania is more like yellow and maybe even green . 
  i 've had a bisexual friend in satu mare , transylvania everyone was friend with him , if you find the right people no one gives a fuck if you are gay or not . 
  using `` soccer '' on / r/europe ... wtf ? 
  should i change my opinion from what you said here that i already knew because i wo n't . 
  why is there nothing patriotic about that ? 
  most romanians i know are proud of our history for fighting the communists while they do n't even mention and other are disgusted about our history when the soviets forced us to switch sides . 
  it sucks that there are no patriotic songs about the eastern front . 
  it 's quite the opposite for me . 
  german is my favourite and russian is my least favourite . 
  why ? 
  could n't they just eat them ? 
  that would be hugely useful in romania , it 's like a dog invasion in most cities here . 
  romania had secret police and former communists rule the country since the '89 revolution and it 's not way too bad to live here . 
  well you are brothers since bavaria is germany, 
  russia today ? 
  really ? 
  i though you were at war with russia over the origin of vodka, 
  only now did you realize ? 
  the more you go to east the more corrupt it gets . 
  i would give him 100 upvotes if i could, 
  * gypsy, 
  i 'd upvote you , but you called them `` roma '' so no upvote for you . 
  no , you dumb shit . 
  i just said i want to live enough to see the history and witness the fall of a great empire/country , like other falled before . 
  so what has this got to to with the fall of the usa ? 
  * decades old things . 
  haha, 
  turkey is n't europe . 
  europeans would n't terrorize and kill minorities , cough cough kurds . 
  * apeshit islamists * , like turks are n't that, 
  damn turks, 
  i bought a pack for 5 lei . . 
  good, 
  in romania, 
  so he 's practically a romanian, 
  i actually do n't mind these abusive traffickers . . 
  they are economical migrants . 
  if they want a safe place , try settling in greece , macedonia , where they travel trough . 
  oh you little sensible flower . . 
  what 's the problem with exterminating slavs and gypsies ? 
  yea but we need 'em, 
  the sad thing is that they target drug dealers . . 
  i though it was more, 
  was n't br\u00e2nz\u0103 of dacian origin ? 
  i was expecting them to make it on the kurdish zones . 
  expected, 
  what 's wrong with anschluss ? 
  in romania , the german occupation was awesome , both of my grandmothers told me that they usually gave her sugar cubes and sweets to her and her family , which they never tasted before . 
  same for romania, 
  voievod means king in romanian . 
  actually i notived from the start that moldovan looks familiar, 
  well , he 's right, 
  also romania about terrorism ( 43 % ) even though no one would bomb romania . 
  yes , i would argue even b1 , maybe 2 . 
  what 's wrong with austria then ? 
  from what i 've seen , very few women did drugs , so that might bring the stats down . 
  obviously a lot of them lie , 100 % of my male friends did drugs but if asked probly less than 40 % would tell the truth, 
  i do n't know , i have heard that eu people can get in easier than cipriots and turks . 
  maybe that 's why it felt se relaxed for me . 
  lol ? 
  i got inside in like 2 minutes . 
  i entered the turkish side only by showing my id and when i got out they didn ; t even bother to check my bags or anything, 
  cyprus from what i heard, 
  if you actually read history , he did n't actually had a choice . 
  and he did n't kill a lot of innocent people , he did n't even enact the final solution in proper romania . 
  yeah , it really shows . 
  if you actually read about him , he was a actually a really good leader at that time . 
  sad day for italy, 
  by way poorer you mean [ 2 % and 8 % poorer ] ( http://www.analizeeconomice.ro/2016/11/care-erau-diferentele-de-dezvoltare_28.html ) ? 
  how is quality of life calculated ? 
  i ca n't imagine any scenario where georgia us is better than belgium or about half of other european countries, 
  was n't aware of that,

  it 's like we have that right ... 
   defamation who says it 's defamation , slander ? 
  only a judge can . 
  i 100 % agree about violent threats , but they are already covered by law so why is this necessary ? 
  so if i say like `` refugees are ruining my country , no more '' is that a threat ? 
  because this is the kind of posts that got police to people 's door from what i read . 
  wow ... so much hate speech . 
  reddit should delete this . 
  but if i say i hate all turks is not ok ? 
  ( i do n't but i should be allowed to say ) if you say `` we should burn them all on the stake '' then it 's inciting to physical violence/murder and you can contact authorities . 
  well for those there are already laws that are applied . 
  this is for not saying what the government does n't want . 
  do you have the right not to be offended ? 
  if yes , you just offended me by enabling censorship . 
  so judges order to delete these posts or facebook ? 
  i think the latter . 
  and ignoring it is as bad as exaggerating . 
  first step to recovery is admiting you have a problem . 
  but then why is this thread saying : nothing to see here . . move along . 
  that is a definition you pulled out of your ass . 
  so is china racist ? 
  or japan ? 
  or south korea ? 
  how is that person racist ? 
  what did he say that made you believe he s racist . 
  also how can you defend the actions of those people harassing that guy that did n't say or do anything to them . 
  yeah that 's right . . 
  turn europe into safe space by ... defending free speech ? 
  retarded logic . . 
  the management tax is payed to companies in tax heaven around the world . 
  that 's how big companies get money out of romania without paying taxes ( they report 0 or low profit but everyone knows it 's a sham ) . 
  well it has the biggest it sector also . 
  why the hell should we share some territory with hungary ? 
   how would romania with all their neighbouring allies be able to defend against russian attack ? 
  well you have to fight back . 
  if someone wants to kidnap you , you just go along ? 
   why buying military equipment when russia acts through cybernetic attacks and economic/diplomatic pressures ? 
  just like in ukraine ? 
  well it 's not like what was leaked was n't true . 
  democrats should blame themselves for having such corrupt people , like the one who worked for cnn as analyst and leaked questions to the clinton campaign about from a future debate . 
  last year i visited stockholm , malmo and copenhagen . 
  i liked most copenhagen ( sorry to say ) . 
  it 's such an interesting mix of old and new . 
  also that neighborhood `` christiania '' where you could buy weed like a christmas market ( not my thing though ) and the driverless metro . . 
  strange ... 
  why not malmo ? 
  btw . . stockholm is very expensive . 
  i had to control my beer drinking . . 
  on the long run it 's a bad decision not to sanction big companies when they break the law . 
  also it hurts the ones that play fair ( psa , fiat , etc ) the ec sanctions american companies like google because they exists but wo n't touch internal monopols . 
  well from what i know it 's the only country where you can pay not to go to jail . 
  wow . . you 've got a lot of cars there ... 
  laws for thee but not for me . 
  also high catholic priest should not be charged with pedophilia because it would damage the church . 
  so it 's like you either take me or i ll kill myself !, 
   this discussion is over . 
  yeah it is . 
  how about the part that us made germany what it is today by investing tens of billions of dollars in it . 
  germany is free to ask whatever it wants but it should be very grateful towards america . 
  russia on the other side only made life worse for everybody under it 's tentacles . 
   but the point is you do n't understand the climate in germany . 
  die linke might go up and down parading a return to socialism , may 1st riots might smash against the police , but it 's a conservative country . 
  you 're taking outliers , but have no clue of the fundamentals . 
  i really do n't care . 
  migrants see on tv that they are wanted and welcome ( by many left wing politicians ) and they want to go there . 
  yeah all migrants want to go to germany/sweden . 
  why should the rest of europe take them ? 
   why do n't i just personally get a rifle and restore libyan and syrian government we can pay to act like a buffer state ? 
  is that the question ? 
  no but we can turn around the boats to libya where they came from . 
  or france can take them because they are partly guilty of whats now in libya . 
   how are ngos to blame for smugglers being pieces of shit and sending people off on the sea on improvised boats ? 
  they know the risk of getting to europe , still they go on . 
  they are n't victims , they are also guilty . 
   this is the same logic that blames women when they are raped by men who claim they could n't help it because they were wearing `` revealing '' clothes . 
  queue `` victim blaming '' ... 
  okay . 
  but you got it wrong . . 
  the ong are n't getting raped and i blame them ... 
  they are not victims . 
  it 's easy without them -  less migrants would risk the voyage -  less deaths . 
   i think whatever you use for a news source needs dumping for the sake of your mental health . 
  just search `` welcome refugees '' pictures . 
  https://www.commondreams.org/sites/default/files/styles/cd_large/public/headlines/refugees_welcome_dublin.jpg?itok=iuztpeut this is the first one . 
  do n't tell me , it 's shopped ? 
   stop being edgy , pick up a book , go to your universities international relations talks/meetings , there 's a lot you can learn . 
  lol , you sound like a politician ... you know the ones who talk much but do n't do absolute anything . 
   german 's do n't want refugees they are the only country with `` welcome refugees '' parades . 
  that 's why the refugees come , because they think they are welcome , and that 's germany 's and sweden 's fault . 
  they should take all the refugees . 
   so now she 's working on getting them back to africa good luck with that . 
  never gon na happen . 
  because it 's raciss, 
  but ngos like medics are the one that are encouraging them ... 
  so the ngo are partly cause of their deaths . 
  no taking selfies with every refugee like the rest of politicians ? 
  so why are they voting for a populist ? 
  if that 's what germans want , then give them ( refugees ) and leave the rest of europe alone . 
  if you search `` merkel refugee '' you will see a shit-ton of refugees taking selfies with merkel where she is smiling . 
  how on earth does n't that gives the impression they are not welcome ?

  generally romance speakers . 
  in romania , it is n't very hard to talk to strangers . 
  especially old people , they talk a lot . 
  some will be up for a chat with a stranger , others will nod and smile hoping you 'll go away , but romanians in general can be quite chatty from my experience . 
  picked up a frog and tried to put it on my mates ' faces . 
  well , at least you did n't get registered as a sex offender while peeing on a highschool . 
  italy , spain , france and portugal . 
  romania is geographically southeastern europe , but in cold war terms , it is eastern europe . 
  the reality of romania is that while there we are poorer , we have more corruption , we are more religious/conservative and we immigrate more than we should ( excluding the roma immigrants abroad who are often associated with `` the face of romania '' ) , people like nigel farage and a part of the british media ( using them as obvious examples ) exaggerate things . 
  for example , he said uk should not be in a union with countries like romania and bulgaria because we are too corrupt . 
  italy is more corrupt than romania according to recent statistics . 
  does anyone even talk about it ? 
  no corruption if you do n't talk about it , right ? 
  especially when the western media does n't talk about it . 
  the truth is that there 's a lot of xenophobia and prejudice against ee , from petty , small things like being denied hotel stay or having people tell you that you are `` polish vermin '' to politicians saying `` i would not want to live next to a romanian . '', 
  or not being allowed into schengen despite working hard to meet criteria just because certain we countries do n't like you . 
  double standards are also common , as the one i mentioned above . 
  in western europe you will rarely be judged for being xenophobic towards eastern europeans , but god forbid you the media shitstorm say anything about other ethnicities , races or religions . 
  there are a lots of very smart romanians in romania or working abroad . 
  the press does n't talk about them , they only want to talk about criminals who make up a small precentege of the romanians abroad . 
  we are developing . 
  maybe more slowly than others , maybe even more slowly than other ee countries , but we are . 
  we still have a long way to go , but we did n't get the head start we did . 
  communism has long , long lasting effects , not only on politics , but on the people , on the way a society thinks . 
  because of many things ... eastern europe countries are post communist countries and we 've been cut off from the world for almost 50 years while the west developed gracefully after the war . 
  people associate ee with broken democracies , poorness , low skilled immigrants taking dem jobs , religion ( and thus more conservative ) , etc. 
  you got ta admit that it 's a bit hurtful to eastern europeans when instead of being chill about it , many act as if they were called a `` motherfucker '' or something . 
  senpai noticed us . 
  my experience with them was overall a bit more negative , but i 've met quite a few nice gypsies as well . 
  it really depends . 
  some try to scam you or steal from you , other are normal people with normal lives . 
  i 've had a few gypsies as classmates , they were usually normal kids , but some were bullies . 
  traitor !!, 
  nope . 
  we have bunic\u0103 and bunic or mamaie and tataie . 
  for auntie and uncle we have m\u0103tu\u015f\u0103 and unchi . 
  jeans and a shirt . 
  usually black . 
  like my soul . 
  lol 2 . 
  something easy like a sandwich or two . 
  i do n't eat much . 
  i drink water , juice or tea , depending on what i want at the moment . 
  my anxiety . 
  there has never been something as frustrating or stressful as anxiety . 
  worried . 
  `` i 'm okay . '', 
  i used to be very impulsive and i still am to a degree . 
  some romanians use certain romani rooted words like `` mi\u0219to '' ( romani : ** mi\u0161to ** ) which means `` cool '' or `` awesome '' . 
  when somebody does n't understand something even after it was explained . 
  ( are you turkish ? ), 
  when somebody ca n't finish something . 
  ( he drowned at the shore like a gypsy . ), 
  bulgaria and the romance speaking countries . 
  klaus iohannis is alright for the most part . 
  he could do more though . 
  i think you chose a good path for romania . 
  for tips on what to see in all these romanian cities , see [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/romania/wiki/travel ) . 
   it 's not like there 's anyone or anything else to prevail instead . 
  mother nature would . 
  those look great !, 
  we 'll have family over and eat traditional foods like painted eggs , cozonac , roasted lamb , etc. 
  and we 'll break each other 's eggs , as weird as it sounds . 
  we have this tradition where two people pick painted eggs for themselves and one says `` hristos a \u00eenviat ! '', 
  ( christ is risen !, 
  - aka has been resurrected - ) and the other says `` adev\u0103rat a \u00eenviat ! '', 
  and they knock their eggs to see who 's egg cracks . 
  you 're painting them on sunday ? 
  in the hallway , but it 's in a certain place behind a curtain so you ca n't really see it . 
  the bathroom 's too small or it would have been there . 
  well , it 's hard to tell you what most people want since most people do n't actually go and vote during parliamentary elections here . 
  last one had a 40 % turnout so who knows what the rest of those who did n't vote want . 
  i guess they 're fine with the psd mafia rule because if they would n't , they 'd actually move their stupid asses to the polls . 
  i wo n't name one person , but psd is the std that keeps on giving . 
  i do n't get it ? 
  do you mean not so liked ethnicity in europe ? 
  oh god no * cringes *, 
  also , that some people are still fighting to make this country better even with these terrible odds . 
  i ai n't touching it . 
  last time i drank some ... it did not go well . 
  i 've been fat shamed , but i was not actually that fat . 
  i was just fatter than other people in my elementary school class . 
  later i went through a anorexic episode when i was 1.56 cm and weighed 40kgs and barely ate anything ( and developed stomach problems ) . 
  and now my bmi is almost 22 . 
  personally , i 've dealt and witnessed fat shaming , but never did i hear a teacher or the media putting a name on it or talking about it openly . 
  of course quite some time passed since then . 
  the media here barely started talking about bullying a couple of years ago . 
  flag burning is not illegal here . 
  i have n't felt a big one either , and i hope i wo n't , but the last time i felt one i was at my pc . 
  i have a very old chair that i need to change and it shakes a lot on its own , never mind when there 's a earthquake . 
  so it started shaking , but at first i did n't realize it was an earthquake . 
  then it got more intense and the doors of my closet started shaking as well and i realized what was happening . 
  at least my budgie did n't go nuts that time . 
  and believe me ... you do n't want to experience a big earthquake . 
  i was at a museum in london once and they were simulating a big earthquake on a platform . 
  i could barely stand on my own . 
  your former flag looks so nice . 
  the colors work and it looks ... vintage in a way . 
  i do n't know , i just like it . 
  i like the current one too .

  what is not simple is the level of sophistication they use to not get caught : the mayor of second city ( cluj-napoca ) had 18 burner phones in his house ; mayor of capital ( bucharest ) had a faraday cage where his guests would put all the electronic devices when they visited and he only did ` business ' during the night because romanian law does not allow search warrants between 18.00-06 .00 . and the list goes on and on, 
  the actual prime minister is under trial for corruption . 
  he resigned as the head of the socialist party to save it 's face ( but not from pm role ) and the socialists elected a new president , which was at that time already convicted , but not by the final judge , yet . 
  who is supposed to write that manual ? 
  but but ... junker said we should restrain from saying bad things about russia , we might upset poor putin, 
  you are right : since the massive crackdown in corruption , no mayor and no official is approving anything . 
  it turns out they do n't even know what is legit and what is not anymore , so they are playing safe for now doing nothing . 
  that is why we have a surplus : nobody wants to spend the money out of fear . 
  i did n't mean that , it does n't matter that it was nazi or not . 
  if germany plays only by it 's interest with disregard to other smaller nations that can not possibly have the same political leverage , we end up with completely disproportional and trouble causing situations . 
  the same happened with that pact between 2 superpowers that divided east europe , because hurr durr smaller states should fend for themselves ( you can not do that ? 
  too baaad , sorry ) . 
  one of the original reasons for eu initially was exactly to prevent germany bullying smaller states , but promote instead cooperation via a common parliament . 
  ( facepalm ) except this is literally about germany and it 's interests in russia, 
  last time when smaller states had to `` push for their own interests '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact, 
  i almost forgot that germany has very little influence on the comission and council , almost like it 's voice is not even heard . 
  i am not even sure comission will try to stop north stream , afterall , it is lead by the former fuhrer errr chancellor shroder, 
  aha , so the mice have to fight with the cats for dinner , good to know . 
  all while forbiding bulgaria to do the same gas deal , because common-enery-market bullshit , that 's a nice union we have here - all heil germany and it 's interests !, 
  that is the purpose of governments : to balance corporations ( via regulations and laws ) and provide some protection for it 's citizens . 
  i know they collude a lot , but anyway , the leader of europe should be able to stand for the people . 
  all the countries accepted refugees , at least the ones that wanted to come to ee , but what we do n't want is merkel diktats leading the europe . 
  yeah , despite being bashed all over , the us external politics is consistent . 
  they generally do n't betray their allies . 
  okay , just give back all the huge contracts and also all the factories and companies privatized for loose change to german corporations . 
  yeah , but now ( in the common energy market times ) eu comission forbids bulgaria to allow gazprom to buils south stream through their lands - this was even before sanctions on russia , but germany goes ahead and doubles north stream while sanctions on russia and common energy are the hot topics . 
  romania 10 , hungary 4 ... etc. 
  it 's almost like it 's directly linked to the size of the country , what is the news here ? 
  co2 and temperature are not so directly related . 
  we pumped up co2 since the 1990 like never before , but the global temperature is steady now . 
  it does n't matter what you are talking about , the lab rats have a very similar anatomy with ours , good enough to test ( for safety , not looks ) any product '' - chimpanzees are 96 % to 98 % similar to humans , depending on how it is calculated . 
  - cats have 90 % of homologous genes with humans , 82 % with dogs , 80 % with cows , 79 % with chimpanzees , 69 % with rats and 67 % with mice . 
  - cows ( bos taurus ) are 80 % genetically similar to humans - 75 % of mouse genes have equivalents in humans , 90 % of the mouse genome could be lined up with a region on the human genome 99 % of mouse genes turn out to have analogues in humans '', 
  forbiding animal testing does n't make companies more ethic . 
  there are many cases where farma companies tested products on unknowing people , in hospitals or adoption centers . 
   because torturing sentient beings when there already are alternatives on testing cosmetics and beauty products is unnessescary i really ca n't say if the testing can be done 100 % in other ways but the anatomy of a lab rat is surprisingly close to that of a human . 
  and believe it or not , medicine sacrifices gazilions of rats to study anatomy , including trying to induce cancer and then disecting their brain . 
  ethicist me : even if you lab test on in-vitro cells , i would still prefer to have animals testing products before testing on humans . 
  i would avoid sickening one person out of 1000 tests , even if this means sacrificing 100000 rats . 
  as an ethicist , you do realise that people who volunteer for these tests are not your regular 9-5 joe , they are desperate people willing to do anything for some cash . 
  thing of them like prostitutes : yes they mostly volunteer , but do you think they would do it if they had a choice ? 
  i would prefer to protect those poor fucks that accept clinical trials and not protect the lab rats , as an ethicist . 
  eli5 : if animal testing is prohibited , that means the first ` animals ' - living beings to test the products will be humans . 
  how is this better ? 
  edit : why the duck am i being downvoted ? 
  i asked an honest question , reddit these days ... 
  romania to undermine sanctions against russia ? 
  pleeease ... we have abysmal relations with that country . 
  while in the same time germany does goody goody gas deals with russia in north stream in the same time forbidding bulgaria to do exactly the same deal with south stream . 
  yeah , 1m is bad already . 
  but i goddam hate people , shows , movies and documentaries showing +10 meters rise . 
  you can not scare people like that all the time and then expect them to follow your cause . 
  you can not cry wolf everyday for 20 years . 
  i doubt that tool is accurate though , i put in 0 meters and it still changed the coast . 
  and that map is clickbait with 12 meters . 
  antarctica ice sheet will not melt completely even in the worst case +6 degress warming scenario ; it would ` only ' rise 1.9 meters http://www.carbonbrief.org/worst-case-scenarios-of-sea-level-rise-and-why-scientists-and-policymakers-consider-them/ an abrupt 1.9 meters rise is of course really bad , but it 's not 12 meters , and it 's the worst case scenario . 
  so far we are lucky , current climate and weather follows the mildest ipcc predictions , so let 's hope this does not change . 
  '' shed an average of 303 gigatons of ice a year over the past decade , according to satellite measurements . 
  the antarctic ice sheet , covering 5.4 million square miles ( 14 million square kilometers ) -- larger than the united states and india combined -- has lost an average of 118 gigatons a year . '', 
  this sounds very scary , but let 's put this in perspective a bit : 1 m3 ice = 1 ton . 
  10m3 ice = 10x10x10 tons = 1000 tons , 1km3 of ice is 1000x1000x1000 tons of ice , 1 gigaton . 
  antarctic ice sheet is maybe 1.5 km thick on average ? 
  to loose 118 gigatons , it 's like crearing 80 km ^ 2 of ice each year . 
  total surface is 14 million square km , so you would need 175 000 years to clear it all . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antarctic_ice_sheet it says there : `` it covers an area of almost 14 million square km ( 5.4 million sq. 
  miles ) and contains 26.5 million cubic km of ice '' . 
  so you have 26\u00a0000\u00a0000 cubic km of ice , and we loose 120 each year . 
  i would not call this serious . 
  it is an unintended change , but it 's not disastrous as you put it . 
  sure , i am not saying that there are no bad effects or that it 's good we are affecting climate on a global scale , we just have to see things how they are and not fall in the trap of any extremes . 
  btw , the arctic ice does not contribute to the sea level , because that ice floats anyway . 
  only if greenland and antarctica melts we get higher sees . 
  greenland does currently melt , but not antarctica ( not in a significant way ) , and antarctica has 5 times more ice than greenland , so it 's not so disastrous . 
  70k sounds like a huge number , until you realize winter cold kills more . 
  cold related deaths are higher http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/26/winter-deaths-rose-third anyway , the bulk of the temperature rise is in the nort and south extremes , we wo n't feel such a big diffence south of denmark i guess ; for most of the world it 's gon na be weather patterns changes . 
   philippe verdier , weather chief at france t\u00e9l\u00e9visions , the country 's state broadcaster , reportedly sent on `` forced holiday '' for releasing top book accusing climatologists of `` taking hostage the world '' yeah , sacking him is totally invalidating his claims . 
   eea countries implement some eu regulations , but definitely not all yeah , only the ones that eu really wanted implemented . 
  you see , they are they bigger guy , so they get to dictate to switzerland and norway what to implement , if they want to trade with eu . 
  i do n't know how brits can imagine that they will define the terms of negotiation with eea . 
  if now you do n't like germany diktates , wait to see after you brexit !, 
  romanian wine is quite good , mind you, 
  oh common , of course all conquerors consider other people 's goods to belong to them . 
  but after the looting you can setup administration ( btw , most looting back then did not end up with foreign administration ) and rule an empire . 
  now , i am talking how you can run the empire : really backwards and kept hundreds of years with no progress like the ottomans or be more open , progressive , like the westerners . 
  by the 1800s the ottoman empire was so left behind that all countries under them were practically medieval . 
  the first laws in the modern sense were introduced in romania by russians in 1831 . 
  imagine the always backward russia being more advanced that the ottoman empire . 
  family guy sums it up nicely : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwzmdvhkrue, 
  romania never was in the soviet union , fyi, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_oldest_universities_in_continuous_operation#founded_before_1500 they have 2 univesities there , how many does turkey or ottoman empire have founded ? 
  you can not possibly compare the ottoman empire with sweden, 
  it 's safer than throwing money at much more dubious people ... 
  i do n't think that is why east europe are afraid of muslims , even the ottomans did n't force their religion or sharia on us , lol . 
  but you ca n't compare being occupied by sweden , one of the most progressive nations with the backwards ottomans . 
  why do you think balkans + romania are so poor ? 
  they set us back 200 years . 
  the wealthiest balkan country is greece , and they got off the ottomans 60 years ahead of the others , they also did n't have the ussr . 
  so do n't tell me this is not a reason for hate . 
  that is for sure the reason we hate russia . 
  or at the bottom , to be precise,

  just look at croatia , they 're not much richer than romania but they 're cities look way better than ours . 
  edit : also , ppp gdp is much more accurate than nominal gdp ( which you used ) when comparing standards of living . 
  because phones make sounds , sounds distract other people from their reading . 
  well , here , since prostitution is illegal anyway , the underage prostitutes get pretty much the same treatment as adult prostitutes by the authorities - the police comes , rounds them up , writes them tickets and leave them to continue their business . 
  in some areas , prostitutes are fined almost every single day . 
  since they ca n't afford to pay all the fines , they generally do community service instead . 
  some police officers have sex with the prostitutes in exchange for not fining them . 
  of course , pimps who exploit underage girls get much harsher punishments . 
   show me a model with better stats . 
  well , if there are prostitutes fucking for 100 kr , i 'd say it 's a shit model . 
  also , since the risk falls on the client , it means the demand is lower than it would be , thus meaning prostitutes must offer very low prices if they want to stay in business . 
  it still does n't make any sense , yes , some prostitutes are victims , the same way a person who is forced to do something illegal by someone who has a gun to their head is a victim . 
  sex exploitation and prostitution are two separate things . 
  people are exploited for a variety of other things , like agricultural work , but just because some people are being exploited you still do n't hear anyone advocating for agricultural work to be made illegal . 
  the same goes for sex work , if trafficking/exploitation is a problem , then focus on trafficking/exploitation , not sex work itself . 
  also , how are the clients at fault ? 
  they 're not the ones exploiting the prostitutes , the pimps are ... 
  well , of course you ca n't rule out that it might be a scam , but i do n't think it was , the police identified over 30 ex-virgins that were part of network , i 'm guessing if it was a scam at least a few of them would have told the investigators . 
  also , do n't forget that moldova is a desperately poor country , prostitution and human trafficking is rampant there and 16-19 year olds are particularly impressionable . 
  well prostitutes still have their money confiscated and have to pay fines/do community service . 
  even before 2014 , i doubt there was a single prostitute who went to prison . 
  pimping is still very illegal and can land you in prison for many years . 
   offering sexual services for as little as 100 kr . 
  wow that 's even cheaper than in romania . 
  what the hell can you buy in sweden with 100 kr ? 
  not to mention they have to share that with the pimp ... 
  wow , nyc escorts are expensive as f ** k. here , with that amount of money , you could probably get a random non-prostitute 10/10 gold digger to have sex with you every day for a few months even if you were a fugly , obese midget . 
  well , you know , if there 's demand for something , there will be supply . 
  they were n't even any kind of virgins , they were selected through beauty contests . 
  only the best of the best . 
  in romania , the unattractive ones are still on the streets . 
  on the internet , it 's mostly white collar people who look for prostitutes and white collar people generally do n't want to fuck a prostitute that looks like a tramp . 
  thus , [ these gals ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekdhajcgeeg ) probably would n't stand a chance on the internet . 
   street prostitutes range from 40 $ -100 $ depending on the area and the service asked . 
  wow , that 's really expensive . 
  i would n't have sex with a street prostitute if you paid me , let alone for $ 100 . 
   romanian actually , i think most are moldovan , i 've rarely heard of romanian prostitutes working in turkey . 
   the only difference is between lith . 
  and romania is that the luxury prostitutes here usually are n't models but people who are known clubbing personalities regularly featured in magazines and the yellow press as `` celebrities '' . 
  ah , we have those too , but they rarely prostitute themselves in romania , they generally go to austria or germany where people do n't know them and they make more money . 
   but most of the prostitutes are indeed being exploited , they were scammed by criminal groups in their own country and told they would get a nice job in italy and once here they are forced to become prostitutes . 
  it 's true that many find themselves in this situation , but i 'm not sure if most . 
  in the last few years ( since romania joined the eu ) , it has apparently become more popular for pimps to recruit willing girls and tell them beforehand what they 'll be doing in italy , thus making it consensual . 
  of course , it 's still illegal and there still are cases of abuse , but there 's certainly less violence than there used to be . 
  yeah , that 's what i meant , that 's why i only quoted the `` every wallet '' part . 
  edited it to `` every pocket '' as it is indeed more accurate . 
  but how does the state know how much they make ? 
  do you get a receipt after you fuck a prostitute ? 
  also , what are the prices like ? 
  could n't find the original video , [ just the aftermath ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9udern6omia ), 
  was expecting to see half naked whores running around and masked police with smgs . 
  at least that 's how these types of raids look like in romania . 
  he was probably inspired by [ this romanian cop ] ( http://youtu.be/9k5ceokxpga ) . 
  anyway , i would n't consider it police brutality , the woman assaulted the cop first . 
  how come no one stole the bike , i 'm guessing a custom bike like that with official inscriptions should be worth something ? 
  it 's interesting , serbia is full of guns , moldova is full of guns , ukraine is full of guns ... meanwhile in romania getting a gun is so incredibly hard that only the most hardened of criminals have them and even they rarely use them . 
  well , if someone accusses you of being a child rapist you can simply sue them for damages , but it 's not illegal by default . 
  also , real journalists would never do that , only shitty tabloids . 
  it rarely happens that such accussations are taken seriously anyway , our former president was accussed of being a child beater during the 2009 election campaign and he still won the election . 
  i do n't know how it 's like in sweden , but people who have at least some minimal education here know not to trust any bullshit article . 
  the beggars in sweden are a special case . 
  it is suspected the vast majority of them are part of single network . 
  it 's likely this rotation system has more to do with the policies of their bosses , rather than the policies of the government . 
  also , i hope you guys are n't that naive to think they just happen to be poor are in sweden in search of a better life at the mercy of the swedish people , right ? 
  the vast majority of beggars are part of criminal networks , which work just like any other criminal network , just that they specialize in begging , among other things . 
  in romania , after the 2014 elections , there was a pizza called `` pizza iohannis '' . 
  it cost 54.50 lei ( same as iohannis ' winning percentage ) for 4 pizzas . 
  unfortunately , i ca n't find a picture of it , all sites that had an article about it used stock photos . 
  it amazes me how many products , especially electronics , cost less in hungary than in romania , despite the hungarians having a much higher vat . 
  yeah , we should just care about other countries ' interests and not our own , you know , like we 've been doing for the past 25 years or so , even more so since we became part of the eu . 
  people like you are one of the reasons why romania is such a shitty country . 
  maple syrup is quite rare and expensive in romania anyway , doubt it would matter . 
  they do n't `` go back '' , they either go on vacation or go to another country . 
  there are a few gypsy palaces in my area , they are empty most of the time , they stay here 2 months every year at most , especially in the summers , when they have their flamboyant weddings , otherwise they are in the west , making money . 
  when you see cars , especially vans , in romania with french license plates , it 's almost certain it belongs to a gypsy . 
  also , that 3 months limit is not such a big deal as it is made out to be , it 's pretty rare that the authorities actually bother to deport them , because they know the gypsies can legally return whenever they want . 
  unless they are under judicial control , they can move around in europe as much as they want . 
  it does n't work like that . 
  countries have to pay a fixed amount to the eu depending on how large their economy is , but they do not receive a fixed amount from the eu . 
  government agencies , ngos or private entities have to make projects and apply for eu funding to get eu money . 
  it 's not like the eu gives money to the polish government and say `` here , do whatever you want with it '' . 
  of course , the eu does n't have unlimited money , so there are limits on the funds that each country can receive , but there is no country with a 100 % absorption rate , even poland has like 92 % . 
  romania only has around 30 % absorption rate , hence the big difference between romania and poland . 
  that has nothing to do with schengen . 
  they do n't even want to move permanently in the west ( most of them anyways ) , they just go to western europe to beg/steal , then come back to romania and build palaces and buy luxury cars . 
  in the west , they pretend to be dirt poor , so the police only sees them as beggars / petty thieves who do n't make a lot of money , when in reality they make hundreds of euros per day from illegal activities and pay zero tax . 
  when they come to romania and spend that shit , it 's pretty rare that the authorities actually bother to question them how they made it ( unless its a really big amount , like millions of euros ) . 
  so people should censor themselves to avoid hefty fines / jailtime ? 
  interesting view on `` civilisation '' , i 'm sure hitler would approve . 
  til romania has more free speech than most of the eu . 
  why does a streaming music service need so many employees anyway ? 
  facebook has a market cap like 40 times that of spotify , but only around 13.000 employees . 
  this is not exactly news , we 've met all the conditions like 5 years ago . 
   what i 'm saying however is that it is not a government policy and thus ought to be done secretly just because igor from yakutsk does n't know about it , it does n't mean it 's not government policy . 
  every country has secret policies . 
  the real question here is does vlad know about this shit before it happens . 
  if he does , then it 's government policy . 
   it 's been almost 2 years since the accident , ` valuable information ' my arse . 
  and the point is ? 
  a simple murder investigation can go on for decades , let alone a plane crash that can have serious diplomatic consequences .

  you 're debating semantics . 
  there are various degrees of [ freedom of movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_movement ) . 
   the visa restrictions index ranks countries based on the number of other countries its citizens are free to enter without visa . 
  [ visa restrictions index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henley_%26_partners_visa_restrictions_index ) ** this is not a black or white issue . 
  ** by your logic , we should n't be calling it `` free trade '' because each trade deal has different terms and conditions . 
   there are no trade agreements that contain freedom of movement for workers . 
  and i doubt that we 'll see such agreements in the near future . 
  oh , really ? 
  how about the eu ? 
  how about ceta ? 
  here 's a challenge . 
  give me one example of a free trade agreement between countries that does n't involve provisions about movement of people . 
   provisions about movement of people are not the same as free movement of people . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  free movement involves provisions about movement of people . 
  it 's not a black or white issue . 
   provisions about movement of people are not the same as free movement of people . 
  for the hundredth time : it 's not a black and white issue . 
  you do n't seem to argue that about free trade , although provisions differ from one deal to another . 
  you 're cherry picking your arguments and ignoring facts while failing to prove anything you say . 
  this discussion is over . 
   you say `` free trade can not happen without freedom of movement '' , then you say its not black and white . 
  dude , you are lost cause . 
  you 're taking things out of context . 
  i 've said that  it 's not a black or white issue . 
  free trade and freedom of movement are always directly proportionate because you need people from the other country/region to make free trade possible . 
  i 've asked you for one example of a free trade agreement between countries that does n't involve provisions about movement of people . 
  so far you 've failed to provide one . 
  i 've said that  it 's not a black or white issue . 
  free trade and freedom of movement are always directly proportionate because you need people from the other country/region to make free trade possible . 
  give me one example of a free trade agreement between countries that does n't involve provisions about movement of people . 
   im sure there are plenty of such agreements . 
  that 's not proof . 
  you might as well say `` im sure that santa claus is real '' . 
   you only back your claim with one argument : the whole process would be much more cumbersome . 
  did you even read my post ? 
  i 've brought plenty of examples , facts and arguments . 
  you failed to provide a single example that proves your theory . 
   that defeats the whole point you are trying to make by the post . 
  i 've explicitly mentioned this in the post . 
  did you even read it ? 
   obviously there may be free trade without free people movement and vice versa there may be , theoretically , but , in practice , there is n't , for the reasons i mentioned above . 
  give me one example of a free trade agreement between countries that does n't involve provisions about movement of people . 
   otherwise it addresses visa free travel and making it easier to obtain work visa , and not freedom of movement .

  [ visa restrictions index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henley_%26_partners_visa_restrictions_index ) ** this is not a black or white issue . 
   i 'm not saying that at all . 
  all i am saying is that free trade can and does exist without freedom of movement . 
  still no proof that what you say is true . 
  at this point you 're just spamming this discussion . 
   when you do n't get a visa for the us , even if you formally fulfil the requirements , you ca n't sue the us government for violating your rights . 
  because you do n't have a right to enter the country . 
  what does this have to do with anything ? 
  your country either has a free trade agreement with the us or it does n't . 
  you also do n't have to sue them personally . 
  others can do it for you . 
  [ president trump loses another travel-ban legal battle ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/trump-travel-ban-ninth-circuit/530055/ )  trade deals give you zero travel rights in regard to the other country . 
  if the country does n't allow you to move there you ca n't do anything against it . 
  this is about free trade deals . 
  not all trade deals are about free trade . 
  [ nafta - mobility of persons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_free_trade_agreement#mobility_of_persons )  according to the department of homeland security yearbook of immigration statistics , during fiscal year 2006 ( i.e. , october 2005 through september 2006 ) , 73,880 foreign professionals ( 64,633 canadians and 9,247 mexicans ) were admitted into the united states for temporary employment under nafta ( i.e. , in the tn status ) . 
  additionally , 17,321 of their family members ( 13,136 canadians , 2,904 mexicans , as well as a number of third-country nationals married to canadians and mexicans ) entered the u.s. in the treaty national 's dependent ( td ) status . 
   canadian authorities estimated that , as of december 1 , 2006 , a total of 24,830 u.s. citizens and 15,219 mexican citizens were present in canada as `` foreign workers '' . 
  these numbers include both entrants under the nafta agreement and those who have entered under other provisions of the canadian immigration law . 
  ... ... . .  that 's why it 's stupid to water down the definition of freedom of movement to visa-free travel and temporary work visa . 
  both of them require goodwill of the host country . 
  freedom of movement on the other hand is actually a right that you can enforce against the will of the host country . 
  this is false . 
  these things are negotiated each time and they differ for each country . 
  by your logic nafta is not a free trade deal because it has different trade provisions with each country that signed it . 
  ** free trade is always directly proportionate to freedom of movement . 
  these are not black and white issues . 
   they can use trains and mostly use shipping containers so they can mbeadh moved freely without the people being moved freely along with the goods . 
  if you 're saying that there are no other people involved in trade other than moving the goods , then you 're being naive . 
  trade is not just about moving goods from point a to point b. 
  and you do n't have to take my word for it . 
  this is a historical fact . 
  all great trade routes of old concentrated in cities where freedom of movement was not only possible , but embraced along with cultural diversity . 
   free trade can and does occur without freedom of movement . 
  prove it . 
  give me one example of a free trade agreement between countries that does n't involve provisions about movement of people . 
   nafta does not have freedom of movement in the eu sense . 
  because none of the nafta countries are part of the eu .

   i have n't displayed logic . 
  qft .

  us companies have a lot of influence globaly not due to their managerial fortitude or competitivity but because the us is a military superpower . 
  a lot of third world contracts are signed with weak economies that are prayed on be us interests because the local governments expect that the us will defend them against its enemies ( the government 's enemies not the country 's ) to protect us interests . 
  any blow to us dominance would severely hamper that influence , and not protecting `` the free world '' against an authoritarian aggression would be crushing to the us 's moral standing , because the western world let the us abuse it 's position quite oftet under the understanding that if the worst scenario happens the us would intervene . 
  and the us just let them think that and collected benefits from it . 
  of course the us 's military budged does n't make any rational sense , but do n't be fooled into thinking it 's an accounting mistake . 
  it is a well thought out geopolitical strategy . 
  nato is just a remnant of the cold war , ( and provious self defence alliances , the model is at least 200 years old , and it borught us both world wars ) it is pointless , the us has only a theoretical reason to prioritize latvian integrity over that of south korea , and if put in a position to choose , they 'll send 1 platoon to latvia and say they 've done their job while movin the whole pacific fleet around the korean peninsula . 
  if russia or any other country threatens the geopolitical status quo they will intervene . 
  they are heavily reliant economically and politically on the role of global enforcer , and the only way to keep that position is to keep the peace . 
  i agree but the rate of american kiss-assery was ridiculous , and let 's not kid ourselfs nato is pointless , a simple formality , if the russians do get bored and decide to attack the us will intervene . 
  i think the americans saw turkey as the most stable autocracy in the region during the last 30 years and never considered changing their strategy . 
  i fear saudi arabia exponentially more than iran and russia combined , because money is a more powerfull weapon than ideology or a misguided goverment . 
  if you look objectivelly ( not trough a western media filter ) at how horible both the iranian or russian government is to its people and compare it to the saudy autocracy reacts to the smallest threat to it 's autority , you 'll see my point of view . 
  also iran is the only shia state , they know that at the smallest sign of aggression sunni armies will atack from all sides and split them up , backed by american might . 
  also look at pakistan , they are a islamic fascist state , but nobody criticizes them because they have nuclear weapons and a short fuse . 
  yes , it 's currently being build in romania and turkey , a few local contractors will be used , but the only resource required is a local military base . 
  i was saying in general that they are n't really useful due to the nature of modern conflict , i was n't complaining about the cost , as defensive measures go , they are quite cheap . 
  now , let 's see european comradery at work , who is going to be the first to lobby their government to share the burden , people were up in arms for their government to support ukraine when opposition was free . 
  moral self righteousness was bursting out of every social justice warrior this side of the dnieper . 
  now reality is starting to set it , and unfortunately the only one that gets to pay it are the ukrainian progresives . 
  this is how geopolitics works , and it 's only spring , `` winter is coming '' ... ( i am not suggesting england should pay for the gas bill so all you euro skeptics calm down , this is just a critique to the delusional idealism that a lot of / r/europe 's members spouted during the crisis . ), 
  the us options are stll the cheapest and most reliable by far due to the scaled economy and the fact that they are thy only ones that where war tested . 
  when you develop and produce 2000 units you end up with lower cost per unit than if you make 200 . 
  that is why we chooosed the f22 as a fighter and not the eurofighter . 
  i think the germans are only licensing the leopard , so basically you would get the same deal like with american tech . 
  missle shields are nice , you get to spend money to protect yourself from something that will never be used to attack you . 
  ukraine was strongly pro russian until 2004 . 
  russia would not have tolerated a nato member that close to it 's boarders , and i do n't think it will in the near future . 
  crimea is very important strategically for russia so even if ukraine would have joined most probably the crimean conflict would still occur . 
  this binary view of evil vs good is frightening . 
  every nation that ever existed though that it was doing good and it was righteous . 
  the whole `` the us is the protector of the free world '' is delusional and i have no patience or respect for it . 
   ... take care of their own defense ... ... while using us tech , because as i previously stated , you either have the latest technology or you 're better of training guerillas idealy the us would like to be licencing the technology ( less overhead ) but few countries have the budget for that so they end up having to offer `` low '' budged deals that are not really that interesting financially and have high overhead ( read as : withdraw logistical resources ) . 
  because that would limit american companies income when we are talking about military contracts it less of a strategic issue ( develop the technology and strengthen allies ) for americans and more of a economic one , while the reverse is true for ee nato members , the economic aspect ( lets modernise and prop up our own military industry if we are spending the money anyway ) takes second place to strategic issues ( if russia attacks only the us can stop them so lets kiss their ass , accept any terms and hope they give a fuck when shit hits the fan ), 
  actually the us is saying that , unless you invest heavily in the technology ( uk , norway ) you are allowed only to use it , any maintenance , training and logistics operations need to be performed by us companies and are never subsidized . 
  your stupidity is frightening . 
  i beg to differ , due to our current military status quo , its high tech or no tech so inevitably any expenditure that is worth a damn must be made trough the western military industrial complex . 
  i disagree , the only reason for joining nato is to not have big military expenses . 
  the whole notion of arms races are primitive in our modern zeitgeist . 
  russia could clean up the romanian army almost as easily as they could clean up the dutch army . 
  military utility and expenses are not scalable and unless you go dollar for dollar with the biggest competitor and keep up with research it is almost pointless and wasteful , unless you are a military contractor . 
  mandatory guerilla training for the population would be far less expensive and exponentially more useful in the case of a invasion . 
  but of course defensive measures are bad for national egos and nobody gets to play imperialistic moral games . 
  it should n't concern the eu , a society needs to grow culturally in a organic fashion , you can not force it to mature . 
  end even if you could , it is wrong for an external entity to enforce it 's views on a country regardless of how morally righteous they are . 
  you know very well our politicians pass amendments only fr black whole sectors like infrastructure and education ( thats where the goverment contracts are ) the church assets are valued at a couple of billion euros , while they receive about a hundred million per year ( including construction costs ) so really tax evasion and shade practices are more upsetting than the budget thing , although its not as easy of a news story to break . 
  so most journalist go for the easy polical corruption scandal . 
  regarding the political influence the church has , its innocent enough , look at russia , and do n't think for a moment our plebs are more worldly than theirs . 
  is it fundamentally the church 's fault that romanians still need divine guidance in the unsure waters of democracy . 
  is it the people 's fault for having a medieval civic behavior and lack of interest in the institutions that keeps them at an almost medieval level of development ? 
  i think the church should be more transparent and priests should be held to some earthly moral standards and judged accordingly . 
  but in this particular case most people are still at the level of not caring about the democratic process , i do not blame politicians for organising electoral feast or giving away buckets for votes , that is our level of democracy , and we have so many poor people that are so detached from the government that a good meal once every 2 years for a vote is a bargain . 
  the difference between a vote given to iliescu in '91 and a vote given to a mep today is that todays vote is cheap , it has no meaning , if has no hope attached , no ideals you are indifferent with the outcome because it does not affect you . 
  and it truly does not , before you raise your democracy banners and burn me as a heretic hear my out . 
  all parties will make shady deals , that is why they are running , that is why they are putting up with the media , the only difference is the money goes to different `` wise guys '' . 
  external factors that stop the abuses like protests , neutral journalism and the eu institutions are external , meaning they are no effected by votes, 
  i took a look at the budged allocated for this , i ca n't find it momentarily . 
  but it 's quite small . 
  and considering the large number of believers i think it 's very reasonable . 
  and they do not discriminate between cults . 
  my issue is that they do not have to publish their accounts but can participate in commerce and actually have a monopoly of religious artifacts . 
  and some `` voodoo '' practices could be perceived as abusive and predatory towards naive people that have more faith than common sense , but due to the religious nature of these activities they are overlooked by the authorities . 
  for what it 's worth romanians are phenomenally stupid and gullible , and giving autonomy to the church at this point in time would be tragical . 
  another issue is that religious political radicalism seems to be the most common reaction of societies when confronted with cultural post existentialism , and in this case a middle of the line state dependent orthodoxy is much better suited to deal with it when it occurs than seculars or common sense . 
   it 's very simple to stop seeing things in black and white no it 's not , proof ... my downvotes and all the social justice warriors that fester this theoretically moderate thread  sooner or later you need to choose a side , not really unless you want to be part of the conversation , and i choose the one that is n't team `` russia rapes babies ''  you need to choose which `` power '' you think has a greater chance of leading us to the future you think looks brighter . 
  here , on a very serious note , i completely disagree , humanity 's progress and eligntentment is unstoppable . 
  not only do we not need a `` power '' to guide us , but if we become to atatched to a certain `` power '' for the benefits of safety and security we end up rejecting the change in society . 
  religion , national monarchies , capitalism * are all product of society and they helped progress at that time but as society progressed their value was less apparent and their limiting effect more obvious . 
  * in this context capitalism refers to individual economic empowerment that came about in the late 19 century with high productivity increases , i 'm not referring to medieval trade and land exploitation or the ideological counterpoint to socialism during the 20th century . 
  actually its trolling western bias with reality hint , everything i said is perfectly valid , if you stop thinking in terms of black and white , think about the us as a mildly ruthless fascist corporatocracy that has the military power to literally fight the rest of the world . 
  you could present a counterargument one that looks at facts more than propaganda both the us and russia invaded 2 countries in recent history , russia left one in less than a year and in the second simulated a democratic process to gain power , none is currently in a perpetual state of war and instability . 
  trough modern history , during the cold war , the us destabilise any unfriendly government and financed abusive dictators while russia tried to pull up and finance socialist governments , which ca n't be argued that are much more gentle to the populace especially when they recieve foreign capital to prevent revolutions . 
  ca n't really see the retard part , probably because of my retardedness, 
   because we are just inherently anti-russian you are , people love a villain and russian autoritarianism makes for a perfect bullseye for social justice worriors . 
   the undemocratic gangster regime at power , which is mimicking a fascist regime more and more by the day i think russians are a better judge of how fascist their government is considering they do n't get all their information via the news . 
  in any case you are using a 21 century judgement for mid 20th century society . 
   because our interests in developing a democratic market economy would be the same . 
  so if nobody has a diferent ideology than you , you would n't have to fight anyone ? 
  yeah i think the russians feel the same way . 
   what the pro-putin people there say , it seems that they think that the west and nato are hell bent on the actual destruction of russia , just because it is russia , without considering if it might have something to do with the nature of russian government at the moment . 
  my feelings exactly when i see only anti russian rethortic on / r/europe no shades of grey whatsoever , no political empathy , only putin = devil  it 's also worrying that russians , who are just a bit national minded , seem to automatically throw their support behind the autocratic putin regime . 
  it 's as if what russia is conflates with putin , which is why they see our criticism of putin as a criticism of their country and nationality , making them extremely defensive . 
  what is the world coming to when good old fashion nationalist beliefs clouds peoples judgement  that russia turns completely democratic they will , when the cultural and economical conditions will be right worring about it wo n't move the process any faster  so we can finally put the cold war behind us ... anc concentrate on the war on terrorism and extremism ... the media , the internet people in general need a bogey man , you need to point the finger at something that is clearly bad so you feel like you 're `` on the right side of history '' , it is basic tribalism at a world stage  the russians seem more concerned with restoring their national pride ( in their own eyes , they are sullying their reputation in the eyes of the world ) than free press , free elections and limiting corruption . 
  ... any contry that has a significant part of the electorate over 50 prioritises national pride and stability over freedom and uncertainty , judgement is less harsh when dealing with wealthy country . 
   because a strong , rich , democratic and friendly russia is in everyone 's best interest . 
  except the americans  the world would be a lot safer my fear is geared more toward a uncontested us or china than a grumpy old russia , ideology changes in less than a generation , economical systems rarely do , the us needs it 's military to feed it 's economy , they need enemies to survive , the day they ca n't find any , will be the day they become the enemy . 
  we get it , russia = evil ; can we stop the bitching now history is n't a guide for anything , because the present is a direct consequence of it . 
  they recently changed it to romanian, 
   autonomy on ethnic principles is unacceptable . 
  no , nobody said it , it is only implied , treat them as romanians , ban etnic political parties and stop dangling the promise of getting their own region . 
  udmr is a political leach , we all know it . 
  they did n't defend shit . 
  they only used their privileged electorate to secure parliamentary seets and leverage them for their own goals . 
  if they really wanted to , they could have leveraged autonomy years ago . 
  but they know that autonomy would end their 25 year reign as kings of the magyars . 
  either make them compete with other ethnic parties or ban ethnic parties . 
   romania is an exemplary state regarding minority rights , and the romanian people are one of the most tolerant in all europe . 
  i know i live here , that is why udmr 's complaints piss me off . 
  and this balancing act is ridicoulous and counterproductive . 
  no it is n't only germany banned neo nazi 's because of scared mainstream thinkers like you .

  you did n't write it , just implied it . 
  to be expected tbh , when one has no arguments only smug comments can save face . 
  muh `` russian paid troll narrative xdddd '' grow the fuck up . 
  i am pretty sure that if there were actual neo-nazis in fn someone would have made them a wikipedia paged and posted proof of it there . 
  so you have no idea what you 're talking about and just say shit for the sake of saying shit , good to know . 
  have a good day . 
  so i have to ask again , do you have proof of any other referendum that is n't from 2014 onwards where people were pressured to vote in one way ? 
  all of the constant polls from 1980 's to the present are not an indication of the will of the local population ? 
  the russian majority in crimea is also not an indication of the will of crimea to unite with russia ? 
  assuming that it 's true , how does that make him a nazi ? 
   even today , you regularly hear about a fn candidate 's leaked photo doing the nazi sign well do you have a photo of an actual current member of fn doing the nazi sign ? 
  i see no other meaning to your question other that russia has been forcing referendum results in their favor through military might even before the 80 's so i see no reason to rephrase my question . 
  well i actually do , but i would rather not trust my french when reading such articles , 
  so you believe that all referendum have been rigged , in spite of polls showing pretty much the same across al years and the populations being russian majority since the 30 's ? 
  they are literally nobodies , they do n't even have a wikipedia page , only the frederic guy has one and there is nothing there that shows anything . 
  the other links are just french articles that i obviously ca n't read . 
  so , do you have any clear evidence in english or not ? 
  mind giving some examples of neo-nazi behaviour ? 
  pretty much just because they do n't like her anti-eu policies . 
  but still , others will claim that she is literally leading a nazi party , so i donno . 
  it 's always funny to see just how disconected people are from these terms like ` dictatorship ' or ` fascism ' . 
  if those 2 territories were at the border then yes , sure , the way it is it is simply impossible to give those territories independence . 
  since the 1980 's ? 
  shhh ... we do n't like to talk about that . 
  let me guess : they once again infiltrated 4chan and pushed for the most savage pro le pen memes in the great meme war for france ? 
  give me a break . 
  true , but here we 're talking about geopolitical repercussions , turkey has no intent of losing money and possibly even giving armenia a corridor to the black sea for reparations that i 've already argued about how they should n't even be paying in the first place , so those things are not something that they really care about . 
  maybe , but if it puts you at even the slightest risk of paying something , why would they take that chance ? 
  is n't macron considered as a candidate that will most likely just preserve the status quo ? 
  and mine is that it 's not . 
  we disagree so let 's part here . 
  have a nice day . 
  i am not siding with a militaristic dictatorship mate , i would have had the same stance 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 ,25 , hell , 60 years ago and you would have known that had you actually read any of the points i wrote . 
   you 're ridiculous and you have no actual arguments but insults and appeals to emotion . 
   of course you can retroactively enforce laws in a situation as large as this one . 
  i completely disagree . 
   you fail to understand that the people and government hold the same stance as they did when turkey was the ottoman empire they hold the same stance because , as i 've already repeated a million times , they do not want to be forced to pay reparations and give up land , what 's so hard to understand ? 
   you think that getting rid of the authoritarian government wipes their slate clean `` welp theres nothing we can do now , our government changed , sorry armenians , we dont have to apologize now '' no . 
  just the fact that turkey is not the ottoman empire is not enough for me to say that they should n't pay reparations . 
  however , the fact that those two states are so different at their core in terms of government form , culture , nationalities etc plus the fact that we 're talking here about retroactively enforcing a rule plus the fact that we 're talking about an event that happened 100 years ago summed up is enough for me to say that turkey should n't have to pay reparations . 
  it would be nice if they admitted the genocide happened but it wo n't due to political/social reasons and the fact that they will surely be pressured then to give reparations which , for the last time , should n't happen due to the reasons mentioned above . 
  again , you just proved that you are only appealing to emotion . 
  again , it 's not turkey , it 's the ottoman empire who killed them , again , you ca n't retroactively enforce laws , especially after 100 years . 
  again , it 's not about feelings , it 's about legality . 
   if you think turkey is not religiously motivated then you 're wrong . 
  k then , guess we 'll have to agree to disagree . 
   the people and government of turkey do not even recognize it as a genocide if you actually took the time to read my initial post ( or any other one of my comments for that matter ) i said that the reason they do n't recognize it is that they will then be forced by countries like germany , usa , netherlands etc. 
  to pay reparations or even concede territory , something that they do n't want to/agree with . 
   nor do the people seem to show any remorse for it . 
  and ? 
  we 're talking here about legalities and such , not who thinks/feels what . 
  it 's good however that you ignore any other point and just resort to the arguments based on feelings . 
  it might give you a bunch of upvotes on a site like reddit but it does n't make you right . 
   so basically what you 're saying is since it happened before we `` frowned upon certain things '' its fine . 
  nope , quite the opposite , it is a horrible thing what happened but that does n't mean that turkey has to pay reparations for it . 
  i literally just said in the beginning that the genocide happened and i 'm not fine with that . 
   if a muslim man raped 200 women in the 1800s it 's suddenly okay ? 
  nope . 
  that 's why i was never saying that it 's `` okay '' . 
  you want to give a good anecdote , how about this : a muslim man raped 200 women in 1800 , however there was no such thing as `` rape '' , it was not a crime , until 1850 . 
  still not an ok thing to do however , never said it was ok . 
  the problem is that , 100 years later , the 200 women 's families are now demanding that , let 's say , his grandson , a guy that was actually pretty mad at his grandfather for different reasons and who actually lived a much different life compared to him is now being asked by these women 's families to pay for what his deposed grandfather did , more so , for doing something that did n't even exist as a crime 100 years ago . 
  that 's a good comparison . 
   you make no sense . 
  neah , you are just probably emotionally-involved in this topic so you call me an idiot and whatnot . 
   by the way , turkey is very undemocratic , they elected a man who abused power to essentially become a dictator . 
  and ? 
  last time i checked turkey was still not a multicultural islamic caliphate but a constitutional `` democracy '' ( more or less ) . 
  the situation for nazi germany is different since they were actually judged under an international court of law for crimes against humanity , the term genocide being coined for them specifically and enforced for this occasion ( which i disagree with , they should n't have retroactively enforced a rule but just judge them for crimes against humanity ) and the payments happened in 1952 , just 7 years later , not 100 years later . 
   you literally can not read neah i can , trust me . 
   the ottoman empire and turkey are basically the same thing . 
  yup , except the population ( multicultural empire vs turkish state ) , government form ( empire/caliphate vs modern constitutional democracy ) , political and religious view ( islamic state vs secular country ) , different policies and whatnot , but they are basically the same thing if you say so . 
   the people and government have the same views as before the change what , an islamic doctrine focused around a caliph ? 
  i do n't think so . 
   turkey should pay reperations nope , for multiple reasons : - turkey can not take the blame for the acts of the ottoman empire , as modern turkey actually started as a revolution against that exact entity ( ottomans ) and the need for change/reform . 
  - the genocide happened before the word genocide was even coined :  `` the united nations genocide convention , which was established in 1948 , defines genocide as `` acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnic , racial or religious group '' - enforcing something retroactively is something that i do not support . 
  adding the fact that the genocide happened in 1915 , a time period when such acts were not condemned because there was no international body to condemn them and genocide was n't even a `` thing '' + the points mentioned above no , i do n't think turkey should pay reparations . 
  acknowledge it sure , but not pay reparations . 
  i do n't understand what you 're saying , so you want the ottoman empire , a state that does n't exist anymore , to pay reparations ? 
  that 's not possible . 
  which country ? 
  the ottoman empire ? 
  they do n't exist anymore . 
  there 's a clear reason why turkey does n't want to recognize the genocide , because then they would be pressured to pay reparations for it which is something they ( and i ) disagree with . 
  the ignorance is strong in this one . 
  looks like the polls were extremely accurate , let 's see how the 2nd round will unfold . 
  nothing too surprising till now . 
   your statement was `` the simple act of trying to force a sovereign country to do something that they do n't want is something that i disagree with '' , with no indication that it should n't apply to economic trading policy . 
  yeah it 's kinda hard to keep tab of all discussions when you debate with many people at once , my general point is that , in my view , the eu should only be a military , economic ( specifically trading ) and visa-free union , i do not agree with the eu imposing social or other types of policies that do n't fall into those 3 categories mentioned above . 
   it 's fine by me to disagree with refugee quotas , but the fact of the matter is when there 's a provision in the eu treaties specifically for `` a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries '' , you ca n't really blame germany for trying to make use of it when exactly that happens . 
  true , they are enforcing a law ( i 'd say agressively ) because it is advantageous to them which they are fully in their right to do , but the truth is that this law was written in 2008 , way before the refugee crisis so i 'd say it 's safe to assume that the countries that signed it did n't expect such a huge amount of refugees at once and would have modified the specifics of the agreement had they known how big of a deal it would be . 
  furthermore , it was also kinda hard for us ( romania and bulgaria specifically ) to be against it since we 've just joined 1 year before ( 2007 ) , after a pretty long process and with a strong negative opposition from countries like the uk , as going against it so early after just joining would just give them fuel to add to the fire . 
   much less can you blame germany specifically for the decision when the vote went predominantly in favor with only 4 against , 1 abstention . 
  while true , again , in 2008 the situation was much different from what it is now , if the same law would try to pass today i 'd wager there would be a much bigger opposition . 
   whether you agree with it or not , after all that is the law and voting mechanism sovereign nations decided to give to the eu level . 
  true , but that 's also part of the problem , these agreements are not necessarily the opinion of the people in the eu since we did not directly elect those officials . 
  all in all , yes , you are right that those policies are something that all signatory countries agreed upon when joining the eu , however that does n't mean that they are perfect or that they ca n't be abolished/ratified . 
  furthermore , i 'd say that the existence of such policies coupled with other factors ( like the fact that we do n't directly vote for eu officials ) is what stems most of the eu skepticism and is what has pushed the uk to leave the union and has given rise to so many right-wing parties ( like the sudden increase in le pen 's party or the austrian election ) . 
  again , had the eu just been a military and economic union with visa-free travel none of this would have happened and that 's what i 'm arguing in favor of . 
  i do n't `` know '' it , just speculating , it seems probable since we have precedents ( uk referendum , us election ),

do n't give stupid people stupid ideas . 
  its right around christmas so pig is getting expensive already , we do n't need them throwing pork on a field . 
  danube , charpatians and the worse transport system in europe . 
  we are fine . 
  we are already at full refugee capacity of 1500 . 
  but we are lucky enough to have natural borders . 
  only border issue i see is the banat area where neither the danube nor the charpatians act as a border and the migrants will use to go into hungary . 
  but hungary is building a fence . 
  b yes they are . 
  and gasoline is n't it needs to vaporize to produce a fireball , it is flammable but not explosive . 
  c minority ? 
  i am sorry but most goods in europe are delivered via trucks . 
  not to mention the same problem that plagues trucks also plagues long range travel . 
  for short range you do n't even need cars , we still use them though we should n't , we should use public transport . 
  using electric cars to replace petrol city cars is trying to fix the symptom not the cause . 
  a no it is n't . 
  you need to mine lithium for 1 billion vehicles . 
  think of that . 
  not to add manufacturing , other resources and such . 
  a tesla costs as much as a truck or a fancy 4 door saloon or a sports car . 
  b no petrol is not prone to explode , and diesel does n't even burn unless under special conditions . 
  you are using hollywood car crash kaboom logic . 
  c so you do n't even have an idea how to address the most important part of automobile technology . 
  transportation . 
  you still have n't proven me wrong on the following : a : cost . 
  not just actual money but also resource and energy cost . 
  b : safety . 
  a lithium battery is a lot more dangerous than a petrol or diesel tank . 
  c : range and refuel . 
  you say 380km 's , now factor in a large truck that has to transport goods from one side of europe to another . 
  a vehicle weighing multiple tons that has to get quickly to its destination and ca n't afford to wait 1 hour for each 3 hours of travel . 
  a battery must still be made , which requires mining lithium , and processing it which is fucking expensive . 
  costs go up . 
  most of the cost in an electrical car is the battery . 
  the engine is actually quite cheap . 
  define normal is it 100-200 km/h or is it 60 and the reason why tesla has such a performance is mostly in part do to it 's light weight . 
  and no i am not wrong . 
  you just refuse to acknowledge that you are wrong . 
  at what speed is 400-500km 's , at what tow weight ? 
  and apparently was just built last month . 
  one . 
  still a lot for just 100-200km 's and imagine the cost added to a transport company . 
  and for all over the world my arse . 
  there is none in my regional capital that has 250k people . 
  sorry if i am being skeptical of an idea that would cost trillion of euros . 
  you need special charging station . 
  cause a normal socket and power supply would take days to charge an electrical car . 
  now imagine you have to take a truck from rotterdam to warsaw . 
  can you afford to wait a day to charge after each 100-200 km 's ? 
  except electrical cars have the same problems with the only advantage is acceleration . 
  costs are similar , infrastructure is as lacking as electrical cars . 
  but have advantage of being closer to petrol . 
  for example they do n't take hours to charge up . 
  just a simple refuel . 
  making 1 billion electrical cars . 
  which use lithium batteries only used in laptops before on a major scale . 
  sure you can totally recycle the 2 billion acid batteries from petrol cars to make electrical cars . 
  not to mention if a lithium battery is pierced it will have a thermal reaction which produces a lot of heat making it a potential danger in an accident . 
  do you even realize the costs we are talking about just for the cars let alone the infrastructure ? 
  the lithium must be mined , and processed , so is the gold and silver used in circuitry . 
  and ore mining are refining is more difficult than oil as it requires explosives , refining agents and metallurgies , deforestation and so on and so forth as well as lots of energy . 
  not to mention the electricity for the cars might be made by coal fire power plants . 
  i am not referring to cost in money but cost in resources . 
  electrical cars are simply not viable . 
  saying we need electrical cars is like saying we need to stop using paper and just use computers to help the environment . 
  global warming period it 's self will be short . 
  what will happen is an ice age which will destroy northern and central europe . 
  part of the solution my arse . 
  electrical cars do n't work . 
  they cost to much resources to make and have to low autonomy . 
  we need hydrogen cars , but those are still costly do to requiring platinum . 
  from what i understand this change is anyway supposed to happen , yes our pollution ai n't helping , but this is inevitable . 
  plus there is n't much we can do as alternatives to petrol/diesel do n't exist . 
  and no a 50,000 euro tesla is n't an alternative . 
  more like 1000 . 
  the balkans have nearly always been like this since rome fell . 
  why ? 
  if it gets to expensive for russia they will eventually pull back the 4th army . 
  which would mean unification might actually be possible . 
  now someone tell me where the magical jobs for the migrants are now that one of the german industrial behemoths is getting into trouble . 
  this is a very rich state with a lot of money and influence not god dam north korea . 
  no they are not trolling . 
  not necessarily destabilise but cia is know to have bad secret ops on our teritory in the past . 
  even a base . 
  and cia is known to not take the smartest decisions . 
  look at the soviet-afgan war or mk-ultra . 
  well the cia part is true . 
  and a lot of terorists can sneak across the border with the refugees . 
  not to mention the way saudi arabia is acting with no refugees but we will build mosques for them in germany policy raises a fuck ton of suspicion . 
  we have a liberal president and a socialist party as the majority in parliment . 
  muh far reich neon nazi party iz totally taking over !!, 
  we had more effect than you . 
  its not like romania has sent troops to nearly all nato operations and will send up to 10 000 troops to afghanistan while the french do nothing . 
  sports hooligans have been since ancient history both voices of the working class , political activists and political tools . 
  look at the byzantine empire . 
  `` dying for gods and lines on maps that mean nothing anymore '' sure ... 
  it 's not like mere 70 years ago millions where fighting for `` useless '' lines on a map . 
  heck 20 years ago the same was happening in the balkans . 
  and you just calling national borders which separate cultures , religions , doctrines , political views and many other aspects useless then you need to wake up from the 1st world `` everything is a social construct '' view . 
  for as long as humanity existed there has n't a single year of peace .

  i have more forints than that guy and i 'm not even hungarian . 
  i do n't even know what to do with them , i thought of exchanging them for euros , but then i thought it might be more profitable to just go to hungary and buy shit . 
   do n't forget the eternal chewing gum . 
  what ?!, 
  sunflower seeds are way more important than chewing gum !, 
  they should also be of the nutline brand , it raises your * valoare * . 
  shawarma is currently the most popular food sold and eaten around street corners or supermarket parking lots . 
  once , i was surprised to see some youngsters eating some traditional romanian mici in supermarket parling lot and they were actually taking selfies with their mici meals . 
  but then i got closer and heard them talking , turned out they were moldovans . 
  jancsi , check the result of real madrid 's match , i got 1000 forints on that one . 
  at least your friends only bet on football games , my friends bet on anything the agencies let them . 
  they 're so stupid , they even bet on pre-recorded dog races . 
  yes , there are many schools , especially in the central and western parts of romania , where all subjects are studied in german . 
   well then , you actually are fairly rich my friend , especially given that you 're only 24 . 
  i would consider myself rich when i would be able to sustain my lifestyle indefinitely , even if i stop working . 
  that 's not currently the case . 
   enjoy , and make sure you do n't accrue `` useless '' debt . 
  i doubt any bank would be willing to lend me money , maybe only if i put my apartment on the line . 
  i do n't plan on getting a credit anytime soon , though . 
  i do n't plan getting a mortgage for it though , just selling my apartment and using some of my savings . 
   buying a house might be i actually plan on buying a house , but only when i 'll need one ( i.e. 
  get married , have kids , stop working abroad ) . 
  yeah , except all the examples you listed , except for the saggy pants , are all traditional clothing . 
  tracksuits are simply inappropriate to wear on a date , you would get kicked out of any decent restaurant or club , in romania at least . 
   i got 10 lei on that one you got it wrong , they do n't do it like that , they usually place like 2-5 lei on 10-15 matches , with a potential win of 1000-2000 lei , and they 'll also talk in old lei , so it seems more . 
  so , at the end , they 'll be like `` fuck , i lost 20 million on one match '' , when , in reality they placed 2 lei on a ticket with 15 matches , from different sports , with a potential win of 2000 lei ( 20 million old lei ) . 
  cocalari are different from gopniks . 
  gopniks want to appear tough , mafia style , while cocalars want to appear rich and sexy . 
  here is an [ example of gopnik ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cwcpj3o.jpg ) and [ one of a cocalar , showing off his mother 's savings ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rxbxbnc.jpg ) . 
  there are many german tourists in timisoara all the time . 
  this summer , i saw 2 hot german girls with a 3 series coupe in \u0218ag , they had an engine problem , within 5 minutes 4 cars pulled over to help them . 
  if i had a problem with my car , i 'm pretty sure nobody would pull over to help me . 
  they got rid of all the benches and fountains in liberty square so that people wo n't have where to sit and feed the pigeons anymore . 
  it 's liberty square in timisoara . 
  in this case , we are dealing with what is clearly an oltenian import into timisoara . 
  he is most likely part of either the severin or the t\u00e2rgu jiu subspecies . 
  moar like : dude has a date , grabs his finest tracksuit , waits desperately for girl , then tries calling her because he does n't realise she 's flaking on him . 
   this is the same country where a mustang ( a 35000 euro car ) costs 120000 euros . 
  yeah , maybe because a 5 liter engine is overkill ? 
  i 'm pretty sure a decent car with a 2 liter engine does n't cost nearly as much . 
  bulgaria is more urbanized than romania so maybe that 's why . 
   you mention multi-generation homes , but where a family has 4 children , presumably when they get married and have kids they are going to need a home . 
  wow , 4 kids is pretty rare in urban romania , you do n't see many families with more than one or two children , romania has one of the highest abortion rates in the world . 
  rural families sometimes have more kids , but when they grow up , they usually end up abroad ( that 's why romanians have such a bad reputation in the west , most romanian immigrants come from poor and backward rural areas ) or sometimes in prison . 
  gypsies do n't give a shit , they can have 20-30 people living under the same roof . 
  [ also , here 's an example of a romanian family with 10 kids living with $ 0.23 per day ( welfare benefits ) . 
  i wonder if anyone would be stupid enough to walk in and claim it . 
   i can do 5-6 times less things with the money than if i sold a house i owned in belgium to be fair , you have to consider that $ 1 in romania is worth more than $ 1 in belgium , especially if you look at services . 
  for example , you could get a haircut in romania for like $ 3 , but to get the same haircut in belgium , you 'd probably need to part yourself with like $ 20 . 
   that seems crazy as  95 % of romanians own their own homes without a mortgage according to eurostat . 
  one of these figures is wrong . 
  i 'm really curious how that works as surely college students , divorced men , and poor people rent ? 
  there are many cases where two or even three generations of adults live under the same roof . 
  college students might rent , but the home address in their id is still their parents ' house . 
  also , if you 're poor in romania , you 're really fucking poor , you ca n't afford to rent , you either live with your parents or you end up on the streets . 
  pretty far from it , actually . 
  back in the 90s , if i saw a chocolate or bottle of coca-cola , it meant it was either christmas , new year , easter or my birthday . 
  only in 1999-2000 did my parents ' financial situation start to stabilize and i started to live like a normal kid . 
  from 1990 to like 1998 , romania was basically like fucking zimbabwe . 
  2000s and 2010s romanian kids were born into luxury as opposed to late 80s/early 90s kids . 
  this is what is given in romania for the final high school exams ( actually much easier than in previous years ) : [ romanian version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/r0schyr.png ) [ hungarian version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pmjfffo.png ) [ german version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xlcbwyp.png ) [ serbian version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b8dsazd.png ) [ ukrainian version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aolozm4.png ) there 's no official english version , unfortunately . 
  i do n't have a mortgage , my parents lived in this apartment during communist times and after 1990 , when it became legal to own property , they bought the apartment from the state for like $ 1000 . 
  they later bought a house , moved there , and when i finished high school , they transferred the apartment to my name . 
  the apartment is currently worth around $ 50.000 . 
  i do n't have any debts , so really nothing to subtract . 
  this just seems so inaccurate and wrong . 
  if i count my apartment , my car and my savings , it would mean i 'm like 10 times richer than the average and i 'm only 24 and very , very far from being what you 'd consider `` rich '' . 
  to get to that number , it would mean the vast majority of romanians have literally nothing . 
  let 's be honest with ourselves , there 's no prime minister in eastern europe whose salary is their main income source . 
  i would actually be surprised if there was an eastern european mp who relied on their salary . 
  the guy surely has some millions , that 's not really a secret , the problem is nobody seems to know how he actually made those millions . 
   vlad filat is not only the country 's former prime minister , but was basically the `` man in charge '' at the time of his arrest today i think plahotniuc is more powerful than filat , and even he might not be the guy in charge , as the guys who really run the scenes are normally very media shy . 
  it was always interesting to visit different european countries , but i never quite had what you would call a `` culture shock '' until i visited the us . 
  even though i watched a lot of american movies , the us felt very alien compared to european countries which felt different , in their own ways , but also very familiar . 
  what does this have to do with the refugee crisis ? 
  and who said it was ok because they 're white ? 
  to be honest , i think most people would rather choose to be executed than spend the rest of their lives in a moldovan jail . 
  you take the kids/patients out before you start renovating , that should be the rule in general , not only when you bring convicts to do the work . 
  what 's so hard about disassembling/reassembling a bike ? 
  i think every cyclist should carry a set of tools in case they need to fix a flat or something , just like any driver should have a jack , wrench and spare tire . 
  sounds reasonable ... 
  why make them do non-constructive work ? 
  moldova is extremely poor , if they are going to shamelessly exploit prisoners they could at least make them resurface some highways , renovate a school or hospital or something . 
  14 german teens , 13 of whom were underage , between the ages of 12 and 18 , were used as slaves in the republic of moldova . 
  since may 2014 , they were exploited through forced labour in agriculture and were also used as guinea pigs for the testing of several drugs . 
  the criminal enterprise was headed by a 32 year old ukrainian and included citizens of both germany and moldova , all suspected of child trafficking . 
  following the investigation , it was discovered that the german citizens were tasked with recruiting and bringing the teenagers to moldova . 
  they would recruit them under the pretext of a rehabilitation program for vulnerable teenagers . 
  in moldova , the teenagers were kept in non-sanitary conditions and forced to take several drugs , for testing purposes . 
  they were also forced , through violent means , to work in agriculture . 
  following 17 searches , the investigators discovered drugs with the labels eridon , sinopax and dipeperon , which , according to medics , act on the central nervous system . 
  the suspects now risk a sentence between 15 and 20 years in jail or life imprisonment . 
  why the fuck would you want to live in that shitty excuse of a country ? 
   so you want a 14 yo kid to have critical thinking ? 
  no but , at least if there are two ways she knows to get from point a to b , to at least know how to choose the one that 's faster and less laborious , not choose the one the person with the more authority ( in this case her teacher ) suggested . 
   do you also expect of her to solve the israel-palestine crisis by the time she 's 23 ? 
  no , but i at least expect her to be smarter than the vast majority of 23 year olds who just blindly followed authority throughout their schooling . 
  not just apple , people are very materialistic in general . 
  there are women who suck dick for handbags , jewellery , clothes , cars , whatever . 
  back when i was in high school , a straight a student sold her virginity to a random guy for $ 200 .

  read the article . 
   their mission was motivated in part by ** claims ** that ngo rescue missions in the mediterranean had emboldened smuggling groups , which were sending off increasingly unseaworthy ships in the knowledge they would be rescued and taken to italy . 
  people that claim this are from far right groups . 
  it 's like saying that field medics are emboldening wars because they keep providing medical care to wounded soldiers . 
  you have to be a special kind of asshole to even suggest this . 
   and ? 
  the eu 's freedom of movement principle is for countries in the agreement . 
  the point was that the eu has a lot of non-eu immigrants that are part of european culture . 
  read the [ statistics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_germany#comparison_with_other_european_union_countries ) . 
   according to eurostat 47.3 million people lived in the european union in 2010 , who were born outside their resident country which corresponds to ** 9.4 % of the total eu population ** . 
  of these , 31.4 million ( 6.3 % ) were born outside the eu and 16.0 million ( 3.2 % ) were born in another eu member state . 
  and this is based on data from 2011 . 
  immigration is a natural part of human evolution . 
  it has always been . 
   what 's happening in the mediterranean is illegal people smuggling . 
   do n't conflate the two , they 're not the same . 
  i never said they are . 
  immigrants need to follow immigration policy . 
  these are not immigrants . 
  they are refugees . 
  you ca n't deny them asylum because it 's a basic human right . 
  it 's written in the constitution of these countries . 
   it 's not like there are sources that detail this . 
  / s sources that everybody accused of meddling with the voting process and the final count ? 
  [ turkey referendum : erdo\u011fan wins vote amid dispute over ballots -- as it happened ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/apr/16/turkey-referendum-recep-tayyip-erdogan-votes-presidential-powers )  a majority of german turks clearly are n't . 
  a majority that 's based on a vote that has been proven not to be reliable because the voting and counting process was made by turkish government officials . 
  also , if turks in germany are pro dictatorships , how come nobody has talked about this until now ? 
  the turkish referendum vote is the only `` documented '' instance of this ever happening . 
  you rarely , if ever , see any neo-nazi turkish groups . 
  most of them are white and german born . 
  also , this discussion was about how well they integrated into german society and not about their political views . 
  you moved the goal post from `` immigrants are dangerous '' to `` immigrants vote for dictatorship in another country '' based on the voting system from that dictatorship . 
  it 's an irrelevant and unreliable argument . 
   i did n't call them terrorists . 
  i 'm just calling you a bullshitter who says they 've adapted to german culture when in actuality they 're supporting their strong islamist leader . 
  the dictator counted the votes , bro . 
  you 're using a dictator 's rhetoric to prove that people love him . 
  just let that sink in for a moment . 
  it 's like saying that north koreans that live in germany love their great leader because that 's what the vote count says ; and the votes were counted by the great leader . 
  how reliable is this information ? 
   i do n't think you should equate people who come here illegally with people who come here through legal channels or people who come here as ( real ) refugees . 
  how are they not refugees ? 
  they come from war-torn and/or poverty stricken countries with nothing more than the clothes on their backs . 
   or performing any kind of medical service whatsoever . 
  saving people from drowning and treating them for starvation , dehydration and prolonged sun exposure has nothing to do with any medical treatment . 
   stopping them is a good thing stopping hungry and dehydrated and denying them care is a good thing ? 
   no matter what they choose to call themselves murderers . 
   yes , and one of our problems is mass immigration . 
  i wish our politicians started dealing with it . 
  they are dealing with it . 
  it 's just not easy to solve . 
  people always complain but never bother to actually try and solve it besides the whole `` kick them out '' rhetoric . 
  it 's a complicated issue . 
   no important european society is founded , based , or even has immigration as an important part of our culture . 
  read the [ statistics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_germany#comparison_with_other_european_union_countries ) . 
   according to eurostat 47.3 million people lived in the european union in 2010 , who were born outside their resident country which corresponds to ** 9.4 % of the total eu population ** . 
  of these , 31.4 million ( 6.3 % ) were born outside the eu and 16.0 million ( 3.2 % ) were born in another eu member state . 
  and this is based on data from 2011 . 
  these numbers are constantly growing because people from europe leave europe while others come into europe . 
  immigration is a natural part of human evolution . 
  it has always been . 
   and we can process them outside of europe and contain the actual refugees in safe zones to keep them and us safe . 
  they have no right to anything but refuge . 
  how do you even contain them outside of europe ? 
  by letting them drown on the sea ? 
  we 're sorry to inform you that your refugee status application has been rejected because you died during last night 's sea storm . 
  / s if someone seeks refuge in europe you actually have to let them in in order to give them refuge . 
  if you deny them entry , you deny them refuge . 
  you deny them a basic human right which is upheld by the constitution . 
  you 're talking about things that you do not understand and you 're spreading misinformation . 
   but ngos like medics are the one that are encouraging them ... by saving their lives . 
   so the ngo are partly cause of their deaths . 
  lol , what ? 
  how are ngos to blame for smugglers being pieces of shit and sending people off on the sea on improvised boats ? 
  if someone is profiting from your kindness , it 's not your fault . 
  this is the same logic that blames women when they are raped by men who claim they could n't help it because they were wearing `` revealing '' clothes . 
   nope . 
  again - all i 've said is that their statement was accurate . 
  they said immigrants are deadly . 
  so did you . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6oml10/defend_europe_identitarians_charter_a_ship_to/dkiksos/ `` at least 1 '' does n't mean that immigrants are `` deadly '' . 
   after thousands of europeans have been attacked/raped/murdered . 
  tens of thousands more are being attacked/raped/murdered by their own compatriots . 
  shall we deport them as well ? 
   talk about shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted . 
  deportations have been happening long before the 2015 immigrant crisis . 
  immigration policies were n't invented 2 years ago . 
   `` at least 1 '' is all my statement implies . 
  `` at least 1 '' immigrant committed crimes , so we should deport them all , right ? 
  it 's the same shitty logic , bro . 
  you should still be deported . 
   everyone who has no legal right to be here should be deported , and those who are refugees should be kept in safe contained areas to prevent any europeans being harmed/killed . 
  guess what ? 
  this is already happening . 
  illegal immigrants are deported while refugees sit in refugee camps . 
  most crime you hear about in the news , that is related to refugees , happens inside refugee camps . 
   it 's based on europe immigration , not on immigration from the outside world . 
  what is `` the outside world '' ? 
  turkey is both in europe and asia . 
  by land mass alone , 95 % of turkey is in asia while only 5 % is in europe .

  russia is waging a de facto war in ukraine . 
  these bans are sanctions against the russian government . 
   i see well by your definition we have free movement with half the world currently so under those terms i dont expect an issue  these are not my standards . 
  honest . 
   these are examples based on existing trade deals between the eu and other non eu countries like canada . 
  the only point i 'm trying to make here is that free trade , regardless of how `` free '' it is , can not happen without freedom of movement with the same degree of `` freedom '' . 
  as you said yourself , these are not black and white concepts . 
  the degree of `` freedom '' is negotiated . 
  that is all . 
   avdiivka is not in crimea . 
  it 's in ukraine . 
  people are getting killed in ukraine by pro russian separatists using russian weapons . 
   separatists are not russian en masse . 
  they do have help from russia they 're not russians , but they fight for russia using russian weapons . 
   russians do n't need to separate from ukraine , they are already in a different country . 
  why is russia invading another country ? 
  why is russia sending weapons to pro russian separatists in ukraine ? 
  your apologetic rhetoric is pathetic . 
  you even admit russia is supplying weapons that kill people in a foreign country . 
  it 's not even in crimea . 
  it 's in ukraine 's territory . 
  is russia going to `` peacefully '' annex donetsk as well ? 
   russians are not shelling anyone at crimea . 
  [ aftermath of separatist shelling of avdiivka that left 4 civilians dead and another seriously injured ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3kftia_2n4 ) that 's from 3 days ago . 
   so should everything be blocked that can influence people 's opinions ? 
  this is clearly a blow for freedom of information , and towards censorship , and can not be considered good . 
  those are state controlled russian companies . 
  there is no freedom of information . 
  only pro russian propaganda is allowed on vk and yandex . 
  [ how putin 's cronies seized control of russia 's facebook ] ( https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/31/5363990/how-putins-cronies-seized-control-over-russias-facebook-pavel-durov-vk ) ** it 's owned by companies controlled by the russian government .

  [ russian search engine yandex announces that unregistered media will disappear from search results ] ( http://www.interpretermag.com/russia-update-october-21-2016/ )  yandex announced that media that is not registered with roskomnadzor , the state media monitoring agency will see its stories disappear from the front page of yandex news as well as regional and subject pages russian has special laws obligating all websites to register with the government . 
  all content is filtered and censored . 
  there is no freedom of speech on those sites . 
  also , there is a de facto war between russia and ukraine . 
  this is an embargo . 
  other countries do this as well . 
  the us has banned all commercial trade with iran since 1979 . 
  this includes computer software . 
   also , `` partial freedom of movement '' does n't exist , what is in ceta is just a commitment to facilitated immigration procedures for certain people . 
  this is false . 
  ceta does n't imply immigration . 
  people can go on vacation or work in both canada and the eu for temporary durations only . 
  the `` free trade '' is also not completely free . 
  seriously , read the document . 
  you 're talking about things you do not understand . 
   not even removal of visas or application of these rules to all workers again , you are false . 
  ceta implies visa free travel and temporary stays for all citizens of the eu and canada between the two entities . 
  you 're making up falsehoods even though i 've shown you the official document . 
  this discussion is over . 
   imagine if your government banned facebook and google . 
  google and facebook are not owned by companies controlled by a government that is killing people in my country . 
  that 's what russia is doing in ukraine . 
   oh so in about 5 years time the annexation is gon na be alright because it happened in 2014 the point is that russia is still shelling ukraine . 
  people are still dying . 
  there is a de facto war going on . 
  why are you ignoring it ? 
   but the annexation of crimea happened 3 years ago , how is that relevant today ? 
  russia is still shelling ukraine . 
  people are still dying . 
   now that you seem to have admitted you were wrong in the first place about all that , where does that leave us ? 
  where did i admit that ? 
  these are not my claims . 
  these are official statements by the eu . 
  why are you ignoring these facts ? 
   there will , of course , be limited ` freedom of movement ' in the non-technical eu sense with the eu once the uk leaves . 
  you have created a strawman to argue about . 
  dude , i did n't create ceta . 
  that 's how all non eu countries deal with the eu , through separate negotiations that involve both free trade and freedom of movement ; both of the same degree . 
  it 's not a strawman . 
  it 's how ceta works . 
  i gave you the example of canada and the official ceta document . 
  ceta has both limited free trade and freedom of movement with limited stay for all eu members . 
  you falsely claimed that canada had free trade without any freedom of movement . 
  you got proven wrong . 
  ** then you shifted the goal post to how freedom of movement with canada is not the same as in the eu although you already know that canada is not part of the eu and claimed that not all eu countries have access . 
  you got proven wrong again . 
  ** you brought absolutely nothing to this discussion other than bitterness and hate . 
  read the documents if you wish , or live in ignorance . 
  it 's your choice . 
  this discussion is over . 
   when people talk about freedom of movement in the context of the eu and brexit they mean this ** the uk will no longer be in the eu . 
  those rules will no longer apply . 
  ** a new trade deal will have to be made . 
  ** what part of this ca n't you understand ? 
  ** that new deal can have partial free trade with partial freedom of movement just like with canada . 
  you ca n't have one without the other . 
  the eu is clear about this . 
  [ juncker tells uk : no single market without freedom of movement ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/news/juncker-tells-uk-no-single-market-without-freedom-of-movement/ )  he said the eu would not grant tariff-free access to the internal market for uk goods and services if britain did not accept free movement of workers from within the eu . 
   `` there will be no access to the internal market for those who do not accept the rules -- without exception or nuance -- that make up the very nature of the internal market system , '' juncker said . 
  you can not have one without the other . 
  the two do not have to be absolute as with the other eu states . 
  ** the uk can choose to do it like canada who has partial free trade for partial freedom of movement . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_movement_for_workers_in_the_european_union canada is not in the eu . 
  neither will the uk . 
  a new trade agreement will be in place . 
  if the uk wants any form of free trade , it will have to agree to a directly proportionate freedom of movement . 
  that 's the official eu statement . 
  end of story . 
   when you read that the uk does n't want free movement the comments you are reading apply only to this .

  but letting english be the sole official one is a minefield as well . 
  how about we make all 3 official languages of the eu . 
  all official documents should be translated into these 3 . 
  then all coutries could translate the documents relevant for itself into its national language .

  some say that that might be the reason . 
  also , some say that dubbing is the reason english in hungary is so bad . 
  now i have no idea how much is truth in these two statements , but it might account for it at least partially . 
  same here with the titles . 
   should only watch movies in the original language ( good look with movies from asia ) most people i 've met complain more about all the asian actors looking the same , tbh . 
  i do n't understand why some people think that just because it 's hard for them , it 's just as hard for everyone else . 
  housewives in romania are handling turkish and korean telenovelas pretty well , without any dubbing . 
  yeah , older people might have a problem if their eyesight is bad , but dubbing everything for a few grannies is overkill . 
   but for many people who do n't understand the language it would be uncomfortable to read subtitles all the time . 
  romanian here . 
  no it 's not . 
  you get used very quickly . 
   do you watch a lot of movies in a language you do n't understand ? 
  i do ( watch danish shows , korean movies , persian , whatever ) . 
  it 's way better than dubbing ( which i used to experience a lot when i was a kid , as hungarian movies were all dubbed ) . 
   more than twenty years after the change of system , democracy , it seems , has not brought more understanding between budapest and bucharest this is pure ignorance . 
  sure , there has been some friction about the szekler flag , but saying that things have not improved in 20 years is false . 
  now i just wish both our politicians acted a little bit more calmly . 
   when all enforcement indicators are taken into account ( see details in the internal market enforcement table below ) , romania , estonia , cyprus , the czech republic and lithuania are the best overall performers .

   these western turkey greeks are direct descendants of the ancient greeks who lived on those lands for thousands of years . 
  that 's a tad simplistic . 
  you really do n't think greeks assimilated non-greeks ( all kinds of pre-greek anatolians for example ) into their midst , especially considering how greek was the prestige language of the eastern roman empire ? 
  your argument seems to revolve around the idea that the greeks did not mix with other peoples through all these centuries . 
  the last time uk 's borders changed was in the early 20th century ( * cough * ireland * cough * ) .

  3km-long lines are not reasonable by any stretch of the imagination . 
  and saying that this new shitty thing is good because we are already in a shitty situation does not do your argument any favors . 
   if your idea of punishment is standing in line 1-2 hour longer because schengen implementend perfectly reasonable security measures any common travel area should have regardless of what happened in the years before , then i envy your life . 
  i traveled by car between hungary and austria last summer , i took the m1 high-way . 
  while i was approaching the austrian border there were signs above the highway warning us on there being a 3km-long line at the border . 
  i thought that they were exaggerating . 
  in fact that was the honest truth . 
  we waited for about 1 and half hours , inching along every half minute or so , until i noticed that lots of people were taking a right-hand exit . 
  intrigued , i followed them , and very quickly got re-routed into a parallel national road which was passing the same austrian-hungary border and which had way laxer checks ( you were n't supposed to stop the car while the border-guard was looking at you ) . 
  we only needed 5 more minutes to pass the border , while had we decided to remain on the highway it would have taken us at least one more hour . 
  this is all just security theater . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@47.9275521,17.1325079,14z/data=!3m1!1e3 ) is the border in question on gmaps , you can see how the high-way and the national road are parallel and very close together , but they 're serviced by different custom offices .

  most of the cambridge moles did indeed work for mi6 , but mi5 , under whose nose all of these things happened , did almost nothing to catch them for almost 20 years . 
  on top of that , one of the soviets ' earliest recruits , anthony blunt , [ did indeed work for mi5 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anthony_blunt#joining_mi5 ) . 
  this is what i do n't understand at people who do n't take their shoes off in other people 's houses : why would you bring a homeless 's piss inside peoples ' homes ? 
  because i bet you 100 % that once you walk more than 200m in a big european city you 'd step into some shitty thing , like piss . 
  i 'm not the one making stupid rationalizations for my stupid deeds , you are . 
  damn , some people are just plain evil and ignorant about it when they want it , and that includes you . 
  i always loved it when i was watching football matches on italian television and hearing the italian commentators calling munich as `` monaco di baviera '' . 
  any stories behind that ? 
  as a lover of almost all things italy-related rome blew me away when i visited it about a year ago , had the it jobs situation been better in italy ( the same as in berlin or in london , lets say ) i would definitely consider moving in there . 
   fantastic public transport i have said to myself that i would never emigrate to another european city which does n't have a decent tramway network ( bucharest used to have a great one , now it 's slowly dying out , which makes me sad to no-end , but that 's another story ) . 
  vienna is one of the few cities which fit this , i absolutely loved its tramways . 
   also , humans eat way more clever animals than whales . 
  which are those animals ? 
  link to any study ? 
  maybe dolphins and some primates might fill that category , but no-one sane would advocate `` killing whales because dolphins are smarter than them '' . 
  because i personally regard them as above most of the rest of the animals , as they can pass the [ mirror test ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mirror_test ) , the same as dolphins , elephants , some primates ( including us , humans ) and the european magpie . 
  you do you , you being norwegian and all that and apparently your tradition requiring you to kill these very smart animals , but do n't hide this under the general `` they 're like the rest of the animals ! '' . 
  they 're not . 
  found [ this ] ( http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/publications/27-02-2017-rra-measles-romania,%20european%20union%20countries.pdf ) ( pdf link ) , and it looks like i was partially wrong , there was a similar measles epidemic in 2011-2012 . 
  anyway , this current outbreak ca n't be attributed to social-economic causes , because we see that most of the cases have happened in the western part of the country , and not in the much poorer east and south . 
  what i suspect is happening is that a lot of those cases are happening in pentecostal and adventist families ( many of them also roma ) from western romania , which are indeed as anti-vaxers as you can get . 
  the 2 or 3 idiot mums from my fb list who are against vaccines are all definitely middle-class , they 're not roma , they 're not poor . 
  we should stop with this non-sense `` they died because they could n't afford a vaccine '' , the numbers tell a different story , i.e. 
  when we were much poorer as a nation , 10 to 15 years ago , even 20 to 25 , we did n't have this kind of thing happening . 
  the jews from [ maramure\u0219 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maramure%c8%99 ) have always appeared very interesting to me . 
  afaik they were one of the few jewish communities from all europe ( maybe the only one ) who had also chosen to lead a pastoral life , more exactly who had chosen to be shepherds . 
  there are not that many online articles talking about them , unfortunately , a quick google search pointed [ me to this ] ( https://frgheorghe.wordpress.com/strabunicul-meu-a-fost-evreu/ ) ( article in romanian , but a couple of very interesting images ), 
   were frying bread , eggs and sugar to kids when they asked for candy because we could n't get it . 
  i know what you 're saying because i lived the '80s as a kid ( power cuts , almost no heating in the winter etc etc ) , but that [ fried bread with eggs and sugar ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=paine+prajita+cu+oua&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;channel=fflb&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjc8myellvsahxkjjokhwuzdqgq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=613 ) was one of the best things ever . 
  my mother stopped making it when i grew older , but i recently re-discovered it when vacationing on the bulgarian seaside , they serve it at breakfast . 
  next thing you know you 'll call the [ sz\u00e9kelys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sz%c3%a9kelys ) as being romanians  i do n't give a crap , though , if you brits do n't want to be a civilized and open country anymore then it 's fine with me , you can spend the rest of your lives eating meat-pies and drooling over european football managers like they 're the second coming of christ . 
  as a romanian who used to eat sunflower seeds at 3rd division matches in the early '90s i can confirm this . 
  also , i miss the '90s when we were actually good at football as a nation . 
   i mean ... yes ? 
  that 's because you 're protestants . 
  i do n't know how catholics fare when it comes to reading the bible , but living in a christian orthodox country i can certainly say that the big majority of the people who profess their being religious around me have not read any of the four gospels from the new testament . 
  i 'm mostly an atheist myself ( i only become religious and ask for things from god when there 's a tense football match involving my team , like a penalty shootout ) and whenever i have religious discussions with people i know i mostly always find out that they 've not read important stuff from the bible ( i 'm not talking strange things like how much hair an animal should have before i could eat it , or whatever else the old testament has written down in it ) . 
  and these are young people i 'm talking about , the old ladies who actually fill the churches have not read anything other then the tv schedule in a very long time . 
   in europe you use sequential dates yeah , but most of us spend most of our time on the internet , where the `` wrong '' order is used , and which can very easily `` spill '' out into real-world usage , no matter if we 're in europe or not . 
  not to mention that i used the roman notation as a kid since first or second grade ( meaning i was 7 or 8 years old ) , there was no complexity to speak of . 
  how about 2017.02.04 vs 04.02.2017 ? 
  hell if i know which is which , i have to think : am i on an american-run website or not ? 
  compared to that dates like `` 4-ii-2017 '' are super simple to parse , as long as you know that the roman numerals represent month numbers . 
  also take into consideration that in the romance languages almost all month names come from the romans . 
  i started following him on fb also for lulz about 2-3 years ago and was terrified to find out that trump most likely watches his shows in a serious manner . 
  too lazy to look for the article itself , i read it about 2-3 days ago . 
  my gf 's boss decided not to attend one of romania 's matches in last year 's european championship ( i think it was one of the matches we played in paris ) . 
  he and his friends had bought the tickets already but decided to cancel it off sometimes around march or april 2016 , if i remember correctly . 
  almost no recourse , afaik . 
  it was given as a government executive order , not through parliament , and because of that it can not be attacked before the constitutional court ( not to mention that there was no public debating ) . 
  the only recourse are street-protests , which are happening right now ( as i write this i 'm about to get out and protest in the street ) . 
  it 's pure thuggery , it 's hard to explain , everybody feels so betrayed . 
  as a guy who grew up in a danube river further downstream i like these danube facts . 
  a former high-school colleague of mine was very close to dying of co poisoning when i was in 10th grade . 
  she , together with her parents , had rented out a cabin somewhere in the mountains ( or were visiting some relatives in the countryside , ca n't remember exactly ) and as they went to sleep everything was ok . at around 3-4 in the morning her dad woke up because of stomach troubles ( because of `` too much farting '' as my colleague said , this one i remember exactly ) and `` noticed something strange '' , he was way too sleepy and tired , even if he had just woken up . 
  luckily enough he immediately opened the windows and woke up his wife and his daughter ( my colleague ) , which saved their lives , as the stove had been emitting co. . as my colleague told us later her father 's farting actually saved their lives . 
  i remember she then had to go to the hospital every 3 months or so for the next year for neurological consultations , in order to check that nothing in her brain had been fucked up by the lack of oxygen . 
  scary stuff , even if it happened 20 + years ago . 
  who wo n't allow me to drive my manual car ? 
  is it the government ? 
  if the answer is `` yes '' then my reaction would be instant : i will vote against that government and try to replace it with people who think like me . 
  and lets not forget about all the [ anjou family members ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capetian_house_of_anjou#hungary ) that ruled the kingdom of hungary in the 1300s . 
  i also find it fascinating how louis the great of said list of family members [ battled the kingdom of naples ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neapolitan_campaigns_of_louis_the_great ) on its own turf . 
   it 's that bro-like highly competative attitude that makes the money . 
  it 's that bro-like attitude that created the libor scandal which affected the lives of millions of people . 
  too lazy to search for it now , but in one of the emails one of the traders was promising an expensive bottle of champaigne to a trader from another bank if only the latter would help him out with something that proved out to be illegal . 
   it 's that bro-like highly competative attitude that makes the money . 
  without taxpayers ' money all the finance industry would have been bust in october 2008 and the years following that date . 
  this is a fact . 
  they do n't `` make '' money , they 're merely rent-seekers . 
   2 ) frankfurt and geneva are considered boring and unappealing places for bankers to live , particularly the former .

  in case of a nuclear war ( and any war between major powers will certainly lead to a nuclear war ) , we would become a target , because we are part of the shield that is most likely supposed to defend the us from russian nuclear missiles . 
  ( the official story was that it protects europe from iranian missiles , but that 's so ridiculous that they no longer say it ) if we were not part of the shield , we would be so irrelevant that we might get by without being hit . 
  actually , in romania , we have the most private security guards per capita . 
  even the state hires private security guards instead of using police officers ( which are more expensive ) . 
   they are natives only in india they were born in europe . 
  their parents were born in europe . 
  in fact , their ancestors going back 700 years were born in europe . 
  how could they be natives of india ? 
   are slovak gypsies also your people ? 
  no , they 're slovak . 
  two of trump 's grandparents were born in germany . 
  his mother was scottish . 
  so he 's half-german , half-scottish . 
   gypsies live like that anywhere they are native finnish or swedish roma do n't live like that . 
  that neighborhood is cluj , too , not just the nice buildings in the center . 
  they are romanian citizens , too . 
  they are `` our people '' . 
   unless you are talking about budjak . 
  yes , because that 's the part we had in 1877 and the russians took away in exchange for dobruja . 
   you do know that dobrudja was given as compensation for the loss of southern bessarabia right ? 
  yes , and it was an excellent deal for romania . 
  dobruja is worth more for us than the arid stepes of southern bessarabia . 
  if we were not given dobruja , it would have been part of bulgaria , like the other turkish/tatar-majority parts of the ottoman empire . 
   looking back it turns out turkish overlordship was actually less hard than russian one . 
  you need to read a bit more history . 
  the southern part of bessarabia is not ( and it was not back then , either ) ethnically romanian . 
  it had a population mix of bulgarian , ukrainians , russians , gagauz and a few romanians . 
  the same was valid for northern dobruja ( which we got then and we still hold ) . 
  romanians made up 21 % of the population , whereas 53 % were turks and tatars . 
  ethnically , it was not romanian , but neither was dobruja . 
   i would rather be an american frontline cannon fodder than friends with the russians ( we all know how well that worked out in 1877-78 yeah , we gained our independence from the turks and the russians gave us the dobruja region . 
  awful , indeed . 
   so we were in nato in 1940 ? 
  get over it : in 1940 , we gave up that territory willingly , without a bullet fired , with the approval of our allies , nazi germany . 
   just suck on russian dick oh , i see , we have a very mature discussion here . 
  trump and iohannis are both of german ancestry . 
  i think nato ( especially the us ) is a danger for our safety . 
  i dislike being part of the `` shield '' as it is making us a target . 
  she was 54 when she married him . 
  russian invasion ? 
  but what if the aliens invade ? 
  we need to prepare for that , too . 
  it 's so awesome that we are able to buy weapons instead of providing our people with [ decent standards of living ] ( http://radioiasi.ro/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/03/pata-rat-cluj.jpg ) and decent healthcare . 
  as a comparison : romania spends 6 % of its budget for the military . 
  sweden and denmark spend 2 % of their budget for the military . 
  yes . 
  the total death toll of wwii is around 70-90 million . 
  random fact : in russia , as in other eastern european countries , a bouquet containing an even number of flowers signifies mourning . 
  you do n't calculate tax as the percentage of the net pay , but as a percentage of the total income . 
   work taxes are around 75 % of net income the tax rate is around 43 % , even lower for some categories of workers . 
  the reason is that we 're poor . 
  yes , police occasionally does some raids , but it does n't stamp it out . 
  from the first article :  police say they believe that up to 7,500 women , the majority of whom are romanian , are living in slavery on farms across the region . 
  anyway , that 's not better than the life the workers live in china . 
  legal or illegal , it happens frequently and in most cases , the authorities turn a blind eye . 
   if you 're seriously suggesting that western europeans are enslaving romanians you 're out of your mind . 
  [ sicily ( a pretty good article ) ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/mar/12/slavery-sicily-farming-raped-beaten-exploited-romanian-women ) , [ 32 romanian slaves in portugal ] ( https://www.antena3.ro/en/world/romanian-worker-slaves-in-portugal-they-were-living-in-deplorable-conditions-236357.html ) , [ 15 romanian slaves in uk ] ( http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/police-raid-plymouth-properties-remove-15-alleged/story-28889079-detail/story.html ) , etc. 
  also , slavery is not a matter of speech , for instance in the uk case , police actually arrested people using the `` modern slavery act 2015 '' . 
  and sex slavery is even worse , with tens of thousands of victims . 
  in the first years after 1990 , half of the employees were sacked . 
  with no welfare state , the amount of poverty was incredible . 
  many fled the cities to take up subsistence farming in the villages , as for the first time in our history we had a de-urbanization . 
  then we had millions of people to flee the country to work illegally in western europe , leaving their children behind . 
  even today you hear in the news about the mistreatment of romanian migrants beaten , enslaved , mistreated in western europe , particularly in italy . 
  the cost was definitely massive . 
  the economic policy that eastern europe followed came with a massive cost to the individual as well . 
  china followed its own economic policy . 
  eastern europe followed the economic policies imposed by the us , and later , the eu . 
   after decades of communism you just are n't ready for it yet . 
  ready for what ? 
  the eu is working as designed : the economic elite is getting the profits it wanted . 
  the rate of profits is the highest since the end of wwii and the wages started declining in western europe . 
  why are we poor ? 
  because the economic model imposed on us by western europe did not work , that 's very obvious . 
  in 1990 , bulgaria had 6 times the gdp/capita of china . 
  in a couple of years , they 'll be above them . 
  in 1990 , the majority of romanians wanted a swedish-style welfare state . 
  we were not allowed to have one . 
   send some germans down there to structure them . 
  i bet their privatizations will work as in romania : the western companies which buy natural monopolies come only to get rents out of the local economy , while doing the least possible investment . 
  there will be no german `` structure '' , there will be only optimization for profits : * they will give wages as small as possible , while complaining about not finding qualified employees who are willing to be paid 300 $ / month . 
  * the profits will be funneled out of the country to luxembourg or cyprus , in order to pay exactly zero profit tax in the country . 
  * they will fire employees who join a labour union . 
  * if most employees want a labour union , they 'll just threaten to fire everyone and move the factory/office in another country * they will fire employees who voice concerns over workplace safety . 
  * they will threaten and blackmail employees who suffer a workplace accident not to declare it to the state . 
  * when an employee dies due to bad workplace safety practices , they 'll blame the employee for not respecting the rules , even though he would have been fired if he respected them . 
  * they will bribe government officials to be able to raise prices for those monopolies . 
  * they will bribe government officials to give them millions of euros in subsidies . 
  * they will bribe government officials to buy products and services from them . 
  they still have assets to be grabbed by western corporation , so the charade will go on . 
   are you aware the whole spain was opressed during the francoist regime ? 
  there were different kinds of oppressions in spain . 
  the madrile\u00f1os did not get a foreign culture imposed on them by franco . 
   i 'm glad to be born a century late . 
  or this century , in a country not at war . 
  putin does n't understand democracy . 
  it 's supposed to be two opposing sides , that agree on virtually everything , except for irrelevant trivial things , such as in what bathrooms should transgenders go . 
  each of the sides have their own press ( calling the other side `` liars '' and `` fake news '' ) and there should be a very lively debates on these topics . 
  people would feel they have a choice both they 're voting and every day when choosing what tv channel they should watch . 
   that 's exactly what france needs at the moment .

capitalism does not involve public financing ( that means using the funds provided by atheists as well ) . 
  regarding your last sentence , maybe you meant supply and demand , it has nothing to do with capitalism ( although the church is a big money laundering business , capitalism has nothing to do in this discussion ), 
  somebody please tell me this is not real . 
  please !, 
  i am not from budapest but lived there for the past three years . 
  i 've been to tbilisi in october when they opened the budapest-kutaisi flight ( you can find very cheap tickets , i went there for 20 euro ) . 
  ask me anything you want about budapest in private , i know the language and i know all the places . 
  and regarding worse traffic - right now i am in ho chi minh city ( saigon ) and it is a real challenge to cross the street at peak hours . 
  michel thomas dutch is also great ( although it is not michel thomas who guides that course ) - check it out as well in addition to duolingo . 
  budapest is great unless you want to keep up with the politics of hungary . 
  other downsides : the language ( though georgian is a lot harder for a neutral person ) , and jobs are not great . 
  traffic is not the best either but compared to tbilisi it is heaven on earth ( really , i loved georgia but tbilisi has worse traffic than many asian cities ) . 
  i do n't live there but i have been to cagliari twice and spent over a month there . 
  northern sardinia is great but cagliari is meh . 
  the beach at poetto is nice but overall the city is not that great . 
  for me it was a disappointment but i would recommend sardinia nonetheless but not for that city . 
  thank you for the suggestions . 
  i will visit setubal as well this year then and will try to squeeze in algarve as well . 
  heard conflicting reports on it but i have to experience it myself . 
  have n't been there yet so ca n't say yet i choose it but it seemed like a good idea . 
  the passive income will last most probably , although nothing is certain . 
  i looked up era.pt for real estate and lisbon is a bit expensive as is estoril . 
  coimbra seemed like a nice city with university but it is not at the sea ( we prefer the sea ) . 
  porto looks nice and is on the second place but i will be able to see if we fit there after we visit all these four places this summer . 
  plus aveiro is not that far from porto or coimbra either . 
  and we will have a child and we will prefer a smaller city . 
  and it must be cheaper than porto or lisbon . 
  but i am not decided . 
  spain is an option as well and moving back to romania is the third option too ( currently living in budapest ) . 
  i have n't been to portugal yet but aveiro seems like a nice place ( just as coimbra or porto do ) . 
  i live on passive online income so cheapness is a factor ( although i guess it is more expensive than my home country , romania ) . 
  i would really love to hear a portuguese why that would n't be a good idea . 
  a very good article that summarizes the main economic problems eu is facing . 
  point no 3 is not true . 
  while romania did not benefit per capita as much from eu funds as say hungary ( largest net benefactor per capita ) or poland , it is still a benefactor . 
  while i am pro taking refugees i want to address some things - the first part with romania not wanting to take any foreign refugee is simply not true . 
  romania is willing to take 1800 refugees ( the amount of available places in refugee centers ) . 
  - with free movement the romani people would not be able to be `` taken back '' . 
  - as you might have imagined , integrating romani people is not an easy task if a country so wealthy and with so much expertise in dealing with social issues was not able to have any breakthrough in this regard . 
  the last part with romania has decided not to take care of foreigners is again untrue as romania voluntarily offered to host 1,800 , what the political class has an issue with is that ro is not part of schengen . 
  to add to this , only 200 refugees are currently in centers , they are fleeing romania because of the lack of perspective ( although at least in timisoara i know 100 % they are treated well ) . 
  i ca n't really comprehend how this will be enforced ... people will not want to work for 200 euro a month net here and will prefer to flee the country and try to find some work abroad . 
  high work taxes maybe ( and even that is average ) . 
  16 % tax on income is not high !, 
  that 's why they do n't . 
  on the other hand 350 euro takes you further in ro than in does in de . 
  however , after spending all your money and having an idealized version of what awaits you at the final destination , i understand why they will not consider it . 
  no , not tens of thousands definitely , less than that and they did not pop up out of a sudden . 
  begging is only one ( lucrative ) business , prostitution is another one . 
  as much as i would like this not to be true , over 80 % of the sex slave rings in romania are also controlled by the roma . 
  this is one video of the pagodas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izndesx7zqs, 
  salaries are lower , that is the high end salary in automotive factories ( after years of experience and climbing up the ladder a bit ) . 
  most salaries would be in the 300 - 350 euro range net ( and even that would be rare as with more workforce salaries could stay at the same level , so most likely 280 - 300 euro . 
  did not know they gave breivik unlimited internet connection, 
  yet , that only means you have critical thinking . 
  do n't expect this from everyone , hence neutrality of media ( as much as possible ) is desirable . 
  and i would say hungarian media is not neutral , far from it . 
  444 is the most left-wing while echo tv is the most right wing . 
  but i ca n't really think about a neutral media in hungary . 
  simicska controlled media made a big turn lately but the most important and worrying aspect is how biased is the state television which is publicly funded . 
  i do n't watch tv either but from what i gathered it is the opposite right now . 
  regardless of us not watching tv ( hey , we are on reddit right now ) tv2 has a lot of influence , and i bet you that jozsi bacsi will listen to the narrative of tv2 or m1 instead of reading index on his tablet . 
  he gives a fuck , even two about politics . 
  he even donated money to pnl 's compaign last year and is in very good terms with oradea 's mayor for example . 
  he was also friends with some folks from udmr bihor . 
  but he does not interfere in the tv 's agenda and it is neutral indeed . 
  but it might be that he wants more market share before doing that . 
  you never know with him as he is a very private person . 
  those are the most popular media online . 
  i would n't say tv2 is leaning to the left at all , and it has more audience than index and origo combined . 
  index is not really popular among 50 + people in karcag for example . 
  the state run media is not leaning to the left either . 
  not by far, 
  [ kill the poor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owi7doeo_yg ), 
  coming from romania , i understand that perspective . 
  and it might be true as well and it can be fucked up for good . 
  but sometimes not having a legacy , a foundation can be built easier . 
  however the fate of bulgaria will largely depend on the fate of the neighboring countries . 
  there is a higher chance of things working out well for bg if turkey develops harmoniously , greece gets out of its mess and at least serbia gets its act together . 
  rarely there is a prosperous country surrounded by weak neighbors . 
  it is impossible to predict that clearly . 
  i ca n't tell but maybe there will be a massive mobilization of people from the west to east . 
  maybe in 50 years more people will become jobless or work remotely and then will try to find the cheapest cost of living ( like i do now ) . 
  yes , sounds unlikely but who knows what 50 years will bring . 
  as of now we are sure the local population is shrinking and it is doing it so at an alarming rate . 
  but compare the world 50 years ago ( 1965 ) and how much it changed until now . 
  it is not game over , it is a tough road ahead . 
  good sign but as someone else pointed out , it is still too low . 
  it will be hard at this rate to converge with the other economies though . 
  czech rep has a nominal gdp of 19,000 while bulgaria somewhere at 7,800 ( let 's put it at 8000 ) . 
  a 1 % growth in czechia is nominally 190 while a 2 % growth in bulgaria is 160 . 
  recovering from a bad period is great and i am slightly optimist for bulgaria in the future but the growth will need to be accelerated in order to not widen the gap between eu countries . 
  very hard to find something for that amount in my city , oradea . 
  outside of the city [ something like this !, 
  ] ( http://olx.ro/oferta/casa-loc-betfia-teren-3314-mp-casa-178-mp-4-camere-2-bai-cu-utilitati-id44e6c.html#609e90291a ) with over 3k sqm of land or in the city for 185k [ this one ! ] ( http://olx.ro/oferta/vand-casa-id4jd3k.html#1ba830e295;promoted ) . 
  would consider both a bit overpriced though .

  tried the shot in armenia then found out it originates from beirut . 
  i will 100 % visit someday . 
  quite progressive country for its region ( although that does n't say much ) .

  romania would n't benefit from those bail-out funds . 
  spain and greece would . 
  greece has already been bailed out twice and it 's only made things worse every single time . 
  the gdp has plummeted after every bailout . 
  ** bailouts do not work . 
  that 's the point . 
  ** being a dick about it and pointing fingers at other countries that have ok economies wo n't fix your own problems . 
   spain barely receives money from the eu unlike romania . 
  romania actually has economic growth . 
  and that 's because foreign investments due to the free eu market . 
  most direct eu funds are being refunded to the eu because they are not used . 
  bureaucracy makes it hard for people to get them . 
  also , this is not what spain is talking about . 
  they literally want emergency bail-out funds for countries that have failing economies . 
  also # 2 , the direct amount of money countries receive and contribute are very small in comparison to the indirect huge amounts of money that are being traded on the open market . 
  western eu always shuns romania for taking more money than it contributes , but it never complains about cheap romanian labor . 
  you 're literally cherry picking your arguments . 
   euro made recovery for southern countries much slower after 2008 crisis because they could n't just inflate their currency . 
  all the other euro zone countries , besides greece , have recovered a long time ago . 
  and they 've done this without inflating their currency because they also use the euro . 
  this is a bs excuse . 
  spain and greece had long standing problems that preceded the 2008 crisis and even the adoption of the euro . 
  the 2008 crisis only made them worse . 
  the greek government literally lied about their external debt to get even more loans while spain had a housing bubble way before 2008 . 
  people always ignore these things because it 's easier to just blame it on the euro , even thought other countries that use the euro managed just fine . 
  heck , germany has a budget surplus for 3 years in a row . 
  they also faced the 2008 crisis and they also use the euro . 
  france , italy and pretty much all other euro zone countries have recovered while also using the euro . 
  you 're literally blaming spain and greece 's problems on things that are common to other countries that do not have these problems . 
  this only shows that you have a limited comprehension of the local long standing problems that spain and greece have had for a very long time before switching to the euro . 
   you can take the dumbfuckistan english . 
  thanks for being a dick and , once again , proving my point . 
    [ analog in the pocket oxford dictionary and thesaurus ] ( https://books.google.ro/books?id=fue0bazkcxac&amp;pg=pa27&amp;lpg=pa27&amp;dq=oxford+dictionary+analog&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pvs3qrkkoi&amp;sig=9jxrrzqbkz2clmr-ajnfwrufsy4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj69rom3phtahuibvakhb4gao4q6aeiqdag#v=onepage&amp;q=oxford%20dictionary%20analog&amp;f=false ) [ here ] ( http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/analogue_1#analogue_1__10 ) it is again in the online version of the oxford dictionary . 
   ( british english also analog ) ( of a clock or watch ) showing the time using hands on a dial and not with a display of numbers so the official oxford dictionary says that both versions are ok in british english . 
  how are them apples ? 
   resort to ad hominem and ran away . 
  that 's a win for me . 
  if you think being a dick is `` winning '' , you 're only proving my point . 
  both versions of analog/analogue are correct . 
  [ analog or analogue ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/analog ) you might as well randomly choose to use 17th century english and ignore the fact that languages evolve over time . 
  [ analog ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/analog#etymology )  early 19th century ; ** from french analogue ** , from ancient greek \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 ( an\u00e1logos , `` proportionate '' ) , from \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac ( an\u00e1 , `` up to '' ) + \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 ( l\u00f3gos , `` ratio '' ) . 
  analogue is the french word . 
  it 's natural that its spelling would change over time since french spelling does n't work the same as english spelling . 
   you ca n't handle extra letters , that 's fine with me . 
  simple language for simple people . 
  there 's no need to get angry and insult me over extra letters , bro . 
  seriously , you 're letting this get to you . 
  you 're letting a `` simple '' person get to you . 
   spain , on the contrary , wants deep reforms that will lead to more than just a shared currency : in this future scenario , ** member states will share an anti-crisis budget ** , unemployment insurance , a treasury , euro-bonds and a true banking union . 
  tl ; dr : give us more free money !, 
   europe 's recent recession `` revealed critical errors in the design of the euro '' what recent crisis ? 
  the 2008 crisis that started in the us ? 
  the one that affected the entire planet and not just the euro zone ? 
  you 're being intentionally pedantic . 
  this discussion is over . 
  we could be having the same discussion about color or colour . 
  both are correct . 
  you probably use the us version `` color '' just like everyone else . 
  after a quick online search , it seems that both variants are correct . 
  analogue is the legacy british version . 
   so who 's gon na pay for such crime ? 
  that 's not the point . 
  the point is to acknowledge it so that it does n't happen again . 
  only far right opponents get hacked . 
  there are no hacks about trump or lepen and they both love russia and putin . 
  trump actually invited russia to hack hillary back in the campaign . 
  but , please , tell us how all these things are just coincidences .

   but the people with a 2,5 k monthly income here still buy potatoes and going to a restaurant is more of a special occasion thing that 's my point . 
  they ca n't afford half the things mentioned in the video on a regular basis . 
  those high prices are for tourists and/or rich people . 
  the same thing goes for pretty much all capitals of the world . 
  even a broken analog clock is accurate twice a day . 
  capitals always have more rich people and that influences prices . 
  the basic commodities actually follow the same ratio because rich people do n't buy them . 
  rich people do n't buy potatoes . 
  they go to a restaurant . 
  average people rarely go to a fancy restaurant or buy barista coffee .

   i understand that most of you might disagree with that , but it seems weird to blame the pm of a country for following through with a democratically made decision by it 's people . 
  regardless of how people voted , one could argue that she 's doing a poor job at the brexit negotiations table . 
  seriously , she 's accusing the eu of stoking nationalism in ni while uk companies block imports from ni because they voted to remain . 
  who 's stoking who ? 
  that 's not how you get good trade deals for your country . 
  that 's being a sore loser . 
  you 're assuming that all of them voted based on objective assessments of what the eu did for the uk and not based on personal biased opinions and widely distributed anti eu tabloid propaganda . 
  this assumption is false . 
   for example here in finland , the parliament can transfer the executive authority/jurisdiction to eu if 2/3 of the parliament votes so . 
  this was actually added to the constitution . 
  did the eu force you to add it to the constitution ? 
  i highly doubt that . 
  if it 's been added , then your law makers did it . 
  you voted for them . 
  it 's their decision . 
  you 're blaming the eu for something that your own law makers did . 
   they decided to rapidly grow using finances they did n't have ( debt ) . 
  honestly , that 's how most big companies become big companies .

  this is not a tragedy , this is just how things are . 
  and honestly romania would benefit from less intergovernmentalist populism , which has been what has been keeping us from joining schengen . 
  we do n't gain anything from this `` europe of nations '' boondongle . 
  :( still not in schengen . 
  because employers move or contract to e.e for the lower salaries . 
  and they calculate their move choices based on existing salaries , it 's up to the unions to correct it somewhat afterward . 
  also , because the bureaucracy in most of e.e. 
  is horrifying . 
  and consider how bad it 's in germany , it 's saying something . 
  it also does n't help , when local politicians out to make a quick euro start fucking with the incoming company . 
  like promising modernizing a new road to the premises but never doing it and pocketing the money . 
  then there 's the outright charlatan contractors that sucker in foreign companies with cheaper rates and give shit results , despite the fact there being companies in the area that are much cheaper and better but do n't have the same ability to market themselves . 
  so a whole host of reasons , most of which can be fixed at home . 
  please no , do n't jinx it . 
  just smile and wave goodbye . 
  any move towards more no 2 , pretty much turns the entire union into another eurozone/schengen system . 
  just enough integration for disaster , not enough for solutions . 
  that 's been the irony of the no 2 faction . 
  they use eurozone/schengen failures as the reason the whole union needs to become more like the eurozone/schengen . 
  the problem is europhobic politicians are more afraid of a two-tier europe , than they are of a federal europe . 
  they 're seeing what 's happening to switzerland , where without moving a muscle the eu defines labour policy simply because of gravitational weight , and ca n't stand it . 
  they know they have to be part of the eu , they know that without it they would answer to germany , the us , or russia in the same way . 
  but they 're so obsessed with the freedom to rule their countries as they please that they 're outright paralyzed with dread at moving in any direction . 
  practically hoping for some miracle that sees them become an island in the middle of the atlantic , or their own weighty empire . 
  because they largely ca n't . 
  the issue of design by committee , with added intergovernmental rivalry and horse-trading . 
  it 's been juncker 's tag line recently to push more responsibilities directly on to the council , knowing they ca n't handle it . 
  i 've got to say , really do n't appreciate how saying `` military hq '' triggers some . 
  we ca n't have a proper discussion in europe if we 're walking over europhobic eggshells . 
  they clearly need a safe space somewhere where they never have to see golden stars on blue cloth . 
  for the sake their mental health . 
   return from the uk to smash the windows , breakoff mirrors , dent doors and spray-paint every , rolls , jags , range rovers and even jcbs , that 's will be quite an achievement , i do n't think i 've ever seen any of those brands in the wild . 
  it 'd be cheeky saying it , but i can imagine a situation where a uk product boycott would end early , by virtue of people not finding any products to stop buying . 
   we have our direction and policy shaped by an aggregation of reason from multiple contributors with varying well seasoned ideologies . 
  you 're making european politics sound like whisky . 
   probably accurate , they 're both an acquired taste . 
  i do n't know about anyone else but calling a politician `` leader '' is an open invitation to sarcasm for me . 
  maybe it 's because of my national mess . 
  it 's embarrassing enough called them our `` representatives '' half the time . 
  sometimes , because they 're almost too representative . 
  i think if we 've learned anything from western companies going to china , customers do n't care if companies kowtow to political pressure . 
  i 'm more worried that this new `` loyalty test '' will be taken as a model in other majoratist autocracies . 
  well to begin with , we 're not ruled over by anyone . 
  because this is europe and we do n't have rulers , but officials . 
  especially since the eu as a whole is less powerful than the individual states , and the states themselves have internally their own checks and balances . 
  secondly , he 's largely toned down his antics . 
  we have n't had a good juncker gaff in a while . 
  he 's been largely more morose from what i 've seen . 
  i say this as someone who did n't vote for him . 
  he was the worst offer on the stage , and expected him to be another barroso and disappear for 4 years as he implements decisions the council faxes him . 
  actually pleasantly surprised that he 's somewhat living up to the position . 
  you know something fine . 
  you watch the us run this continent like it 's own personal circus . 
  as everyone bow to them for their own reasons , while continuing this shtick of `` we ca n't cooperate . '', 
  because we can , we have , but apparently not with european leadership . 
   yeah but it 's not just about you . 
  okay maybe you would but what about the other 25 members ? 
  let me clarify here , that you 're talking to someone who believes in creating a eu intervention force . 
  so asking me about how the intergovermentalist setup of 25 nations making an agreement works is moot . 
  i believe it does n't , and nato is ultimately a house of cards . 
   could also potentially take a lot of time to reach an agreement on wether or not there will be an intervention . 
  welcome to democracy . 
  on one hand , yes it makes timely intervention harder , on the other hand it also minimizes unnecessary interventions . 
  it all balances out , but it 's no different than the current situation . 
  it might actually be easier since it wo n't be anyone from a national army getting sent . 
  similar to how the foreign legion gets the brunt of the action . 
  if you think the way production logistics work is that austria can single-handedly make all the components of a gun , or france all the parts of a ship , then i 've got nothing to say . 
  because i have no idea how such a missunderstading can take place . 
   are you willing to deploy your soldiers to defend former french colonies ? 
  i seriously doubt it . 
  are you forgetting that romania sent troops to afghanistan and iraq ? 
  this is no novelty for us , or unimaginable situation , we 're ok with this . 
  i think you have a romanticized view of how the politics of warfare work . 
  we 're more practical , we understand that for an alliance to work , it has to be quid-pro-quo . 
  this map hurts so much . 
  can anyone explain what happened between 1999 and 2002 . 
  the various pr departments of the eu are seriously lacking . 
  see also , `` science : it 's a girl thing . '', 
  i really wish someone would stop the idiot who keeps pumping these out . 
  although i have n't seen any under the juncker commission , so i assume someone did . 
  here 's the thing : this is europe . 
  i know we like to throw around some geopolitics credentials here and there , but we do n't play the game against each other . 
  because if we did , well , we 've been there and it was n't pretty . 
  so no , i do n't think it 's ok that we spy on each other . 
  we 've got too much at stake in mutual trust , and if we do start that game , it 's going to be big powers ruling over small again . 
  everyone else in the world on the other hand : free game . 
  i apologize . 
  i 'm actually optimistic about kant , for no other reason than it will put the german and french governments in the position of not trying to compete each other for at least this piece of equipment in worldwide sales . 
  when it comes to weapon sales , european politicians loose all scruples . 
  they do n't need the competition . 
   the economy is worldwide but states all have specific regulation all of which tend to be extremely similar , since they try to get similar results . 
  you wo n't find anywhere where murder is allowed , or you can issue a vaccine without sufficient testing . 
  food poisoning is the same worldwide , as is any health and safety consideration . 
  even the privatization angle was the uk backlashing against the nationalizations of the 1970s , and overdoing it , with little regard to effectiveness rather than some sort of local optimization attempt . 
   humans and members of various communities with each their specific cultural identity , so much that forcing people together would not end well and has proved so in the past . 
  oh god . 
  like cultural identity somehow makes health , wealth , freedom or happiness not a requirement in someone 's life . 
  just because a bunch of neurotics decide to make their beliefs someone else 's problem does n't mean the vast majority of us ca n't get along and this continent has been built by knowing we can , and ending the sectarian and political violence which has become widespread in the middle east . 
  let 's run down : new engine ( new fuel/air injection ) , new transmission , new automatic loader , new fire control system ( new sighting and stabilizers ) , and new communication system . 
  so anything that has a lot of break potential due to wear and tear , also can not use parts from a regular t-72 .

  i do !,

  god i 'll marry you . . if you would n't be already married !,

  i look way different and i have a bigger axe . 
  huh ?!? 
  now i see ... that i do n't see it . 
  i thought it 's a damn normal map !, 
  maybe gibraltar but not  gib , 
  and none of us were under direct ottoman ruling . 
  i need a pula to smack your head with it ... unfortunately i lack that * cough * city . 
  we were independent !, 
  we always were ... until those damn austrian came . 
  oh god !, 
  asap a new map with `` this is how i see europe ! '' . 
  and finally i got a normal europe . 
  thanks !, 
  i wonder if your country 's flag would have a cross instead of a crescent on it ... how much in the orcs side your family would 've been ? 
  and without erdo . 
  majorca is ( central european ) anyway with all those german immigrants living there . 
  north pole when ? 
  absolutely . 
  everyone here knows that real dragons have at least two heads . 
  jesus christ whatta pleb ... 
  dalmatia in central europe and transylvania in the balkans ??? 
  where 's my axe ?

  say the place and we 'll fix that once and for all damn ya ! ^ ^ / s : ^ p, 
  from all our banknotes * you * choose the least valuable one . 
  you 're a shame for all luxembourgers .

  e : * i * * know * * you * * did n't * * make * * the * * map * * do n't * * worry * . 
  and a lot of slapfights too hahahaha, 
  http://www.instructables.com/id/how-to-make-sweet-and-salty-popcorn/ but i guess the right answer would be ** sweet ** if i look at your flair . 
  this one is definitely one of those in the heavy category of pain since many wo n't be happy being in one or another `` category '' ( region ) . 
  i already prepared my popcorn , 
  this thread has great potential to become a big pain in the butt for mods . 
  i disagree . 
  let her rot in a jail in europe . 
  no and no . 
  my necee and that girl are still children under eu law . 
  unfortunately that 's the least i can do . 
  i 'd treat them how we do it here ... but unfortunately we have mods . 
  oh ... so i 'm abussed by them now lololol be serious please . 
  i may be young but i lived outside enough to know what an abuser is . 
  i 'm okay with that as long as one person changed it 's mind from `` let 's kill her '' to `` hmmm ... maybe she should only stay in prison '' . 
  i only think it 's routine for someone like her to be raped there .

  and yeah , i 'm hungarian ... not a crazy one lolol and i do n't have any kind of separatist mentality . 
  that 's obvious , what they lack is fear of authorities , police in this instance and prison , which will be better than almost anything they had back home . . 
  i think . 
  it 's first time in my life when i preferred an american/russian type of police and prisons for us : /, 
  hahaha yeah , pretty likely he 'll be raped by me : ^ ), 
  i thought about that too ( unveiled women ... etc ) but , and i do n't necessarily think about this sole incident , if maybe for afghans it could be true . . syrians surely have seen unveiled women . 
  not to mention they absolutely saw them in turkey and the balkans . 
  why they did not behaved like that in serbia or croatia but do that in germany , finland , france ?!? 
  could be cos they see we police and public as not tough enough ? 
  i think i will , i 'm a country girl who knows how to kick a guy 's balls and i bite too  no worries , i know how western europe is since i 've travelled a lot . . my bf is irish lol , that 's why i was very surprised by what 's going on . 
  thank you !, 
  well , those other women were individuals too , it 's not like they all were a group and what happened to them was only in one place and in a small timespan . 
  and regardless , me as an individual am still part of the group who was targeted . 
  not to mention that i think it would be a shame for what we all stand for , to be forced to change my friendly behavior and dressing code only to be safe in europe or to suit some people 's archaic worldview . 
  excuse my english , i 'm on the phone and my blood boils when i read about things like that , 
  what the hell is going on ?!? 
  where the f. . . there idiots think they are ? 
  did n't they saw a woman until now ? 
  and hitlers and ... c'mon now , let 's no fall in the other extreme . 
  though , as a woman , i find this sexual-assault epidemia very disturbing and even concerning ( as in i 'm concerned about my own security , cos i 'll go to w europe soon ) . 
  edit : i absolutely exaggerated when i put hitler there , beside lepen and trump , for the sake of comparation . 
  one extreme is to just let everyone in , the other is . . just like the american op said `` more lepens and trumps '' , so why not more hitlers if we are into that . 
  why be pleased with a clown like trump when we can have a mastermind ? 
  oh , those glorious things , i have tears in my eyes ... : ^ d, 
  how so ? 
  it was a joke , of course i can make fun of everything i want here . . we 're not yet into politically correct censure . 
  yet !, 
  vampiress . 
  and i 'll be back always ... `` i 'm your conscience ... hahaha '' be careful ... 
  i do n't use that , got enough in my language ( my grandpa is the master in those things , romanian and hungarian lol ) . 
  but i use a lot the word `` pula '' : ^ d, 
  usually , from your neck of the wood , it is !, 
  not so much !, 
  i care about them , they are human beings who said their mind !, 
  you know what , f. . k allah !, 
  and that gamer . . mohammed !, 
  and maybe i do n't buy the paper , but we know about it , . . 
  i may buy it if i 'll be in paris/lyon again . 
  in bikini and smoking pot !, 
  i 've seen on reddit , do n't remember where , that if you insult allah you have three days for repentance , but if you 'll insult mohammed you must be killed immediately . 
  dunno if true , so do n't just jump in my head people !!!!!!, 
  that 's like putting the prophet before the god he represent !, 
  haram like f. . k !!!, 
  i know that ** i ** never heard about that paper before the attacks , neither anyone i know , and now we all know what is charlie hebdo !, 
  that 's why i said what i 've said !, 
  i never intended any kind of disrespect and i definitely do n't know their current state . 
  if you think my post was anything else than that ... 
   he 's a jolly ** black ** man ... ftfy :p edit : fix it to suit to your neighborhood , american !, 
  santa , you blasphemous atheist !!!, 
  yes , it 's my right to do that !, 
  a right i 've earn from birth , as a eastern european , to swear at god , jesus , virgin mary , all . . 3 billion saints , pope , patriarchs , churches , pastors and any god known in thee galaxies besides our own and . . and yes , to swear at allah and mohammed too !, 
  but that 's just me , a barbarian woman from the butthole of europe and i do n't know any better : ^ ), 
  that 's cynicism \u00d7 10 ... and very true in the same time . 
  yeah , i think you 're quite spot on . 
  he did n't cared a lot about his own people back in 2011 , when all this tragedy started , so he definitely do n't give a damn about our opinions . 
  but would n't be a thrill to have , at least , someone close to him here , doing a ama ? 
  maybe russia is a better deal for you , eh ? 
  because a ministry for propaganda it 's just that , boosting patriotic duty kinda feeling in its own people and spreading all sorts of dirt in enemies head . 
  i 'm a future lawyer and a girl , trust me , i know how it works  late edit : not that you , if ukrainian , would n't be completely entitled to pay your enemy with the same coin !, 
  by the way , if i walk i 'll be in ukraine in less than one hour from my home , 
  yep , you 're joking :d, 
  you 're joking , do n't you ? 
  my parents vaccinated the hell out of me , they knew i could n't go to central africa without tons of vaccines . . so they gave it to me :'( thanks god !, 
  plus the usual two i 've got when i was a couple of months old , so yes . . they knew what 's best for me ; ^ ), 
  trust me , i 'm with you here !, 
  i 'm very much for ukraine in this conflict , not that it means anything , but my belief is that . . even if for the moment propaganda ( lies and spreading crap ) can be useful , in the long run will bite you in the ass big time . 
  ukraine should just get rid of corrupted crooks and say the truth , this is the way to be trusted and respected by everyone in the end . 
  thank you !, 
  i think i 'll read it tomorrow . 
  but this was about / r/europe , 
  ( \u00d3_\u00d2 ) prison for one month sounds great , where do i sign ? 
  . . they 'd be better than in a hellhound in arizona for a million kilometres ( not miles and soccer is football ) , 
  i 'm 18 and i think i 'll very much do something like that too , if nobody would say is forbidden . 
  no , i would n't but still . . 
  they 're like two sisters who hate eachother , but are . . well , still sisters : ^ ), 
  well , to be honest i do n't think they 're quite independent even now . 
  no , do n't take my words for something different !, 
  yes , ukraine is very much entitled to defend itself by any means its consider . 
  i just think the truth is better than propaganda , which usualy is more lies dressed in semi-true shelves , my two cents . 
  thank you for the link , i know and it 's still propaganda !, 
  russia is a giant , ukraine is just a country who never had independence until , more or less , now !, 
  big difference .

  it 's [ these guys ] ( http://romafacts.uni-graz.at/index.php/culture/culture-3/the-gabor-in-transylvania--romania ) . 
  there are many in my hometown as well and they do n't cause trouble , but are very insular . 
  this is one of my biggest problems with the situation . 
  many succesfull roma blend in the majority , so this means there is no `` elite class '' that can serve as an example for the other roma . 
  i read somewhere that a roma `` inteligentsia '' of sorts started forming in interwar romania , but that went to shit with ww2 . 
  so i 'm hoping the stability of post-cold-war europe will see the rise of such a class of people from amongst the roma . 
  i 've already seen some signs of this happening in romania . 
  ngos and even nascent political movements have started showing up . 
  i read of some dude who started a political party and was trying to gain some strenght in the last local elections ( unfortunately mainstream political forces were violently against this as the roma , being poorly educated are an easily buyable voter demographic ) . 
  still i hope this proliferates . 
  i was in spain this summer , and caught a newsstory where [ a navarrese roma group ( gaz kalo ) ] ( http://gazkalo.org/educacion/ ) heald some meeting and then went on air and held a conference where they were urging the romas to focus on education as that is the key to succes . 
  we really need these positive roma groups . 
  re-read my comment . 
  i was talking about a subset of roma who are not `` criminals and vagabonds '' but who have different issues that the majority consider unacceptable . 
  traditional roma are just like the amish `` craftsmen who try to minimize aspects of modern society influencing their own communities '' and `` do n't bother other people '' but they do have problems that are seen as `` backwards '' . 
   on the bad side , it kind of perpetuates stereotypes ( sort of ) problem is this that this reinforces the idea that being roma is bad , so it 's a big negative for the people who are visibly roma and poor , but are trying to be decent citizens . 
  it creates anymosity within the majority population , because they do not see positive examples of roma , so they think their xenophobia is justified . 
  in short , it hurts those `` left behind '' . 
  i do n't think i can give you a definite answer to that , tbh . 
  even the romanian roma are of many sorts , with varying types of problems . 
  not many itinerant roma out there . 
  not in eastern europe at least . 
  virtually all roma in romania are sedentary . 
  the commies took care of that . 
  same in the rest of eastern europe . 
   i think if they are being pulled from school before they are 16 without good reason and they are not getting a good education at home , then the parents should be deemed unfit . 
  i think it 's more a question of the states coming and taking the kids to school . 
  after all , schooling up to certain level is * mandatory * . 
   failing to give your children a proper education is evidence that you should n't be a parent . 
  there are so many discussions that start from this sentence . 
  i agree in principle , and i am of the opinion that many human beings should not have ( had ) children . 
  but just like with abandoning the amish community , abandoning the traditional roma community means being cast into the world to fend for yourself with virtually zero friends and family . 
  hence the reason why most amish choose to stay . 
  it 's not a fair choice at all if you ask me . 
  [ already been tried ] ( http://romani.uni-graz.at/rombase/cgi-bin/art.cgi?src=data/hist/modern/maria.en.xml ) and it has n't really worked . 
  because if the good ones assimilate , you 're always left with the bad ones representing the ethnicity . 
  imagine if all the black that got out of `` the ghetto '' suddenly turned white . 
  you 'd think blacks can never assimilate . 
  also even if a culture is riddled with regressive customs , it does n't mean you have to abandon all of it . 
  you only have to abandon the bad shit . 
  this is also true with other cultures . 
  romanians have to abandon the regressive shit in order become proper `` europeans '' but nobody tells romanians to change their entire culture . 
  this is not just the `` nation 's collective opinion '' . 
  it 's estimates made by roma rights groups and other ngos . 
   though i do accept there might be problems with the census . 
  it would be nice to hear what those problems are and why it might be underestimating the ` true ' number . 
  given the negative stereotypes associated with the roma , many of them are reluctant to declare their ethnicity . 
  especially if they are educated , assimilated and and are romanian ( or hungarian ) speaking . 
  they can easily pass as non-roma . 
  found this quickly : http://www.edrc.ro/resurse/rapoarte/roma_of_romania.pdf  other estimates ; up to 1.8 million ( 7.9 per cent ) . 
  some organisations have put the figure as high as 2,5 million ( minority rights group , 1997 : 240 ) . 
  the research institute for quality of life estimates a number between 1,452,700 and 1,588,552 ( hetero-identified ) in 1998 , among them there are 922,465 to 1,002,381 ( self identified ) ( the research institute for quality of life , 2000 ) . 
   it 's weird for me but i think that the evangelical church helped more than the government in integrating them . 
  and i am an atheist from a catholic country . 
  i agree , and i 'm as intrigued as you . 
   plus whether or not there is a cycle of criminality . 
  there might not be a cycle of criminality involved ( i 'm taking some of the traditional roma as an example ) , but chances of integrating are slim due to : conservative values , superstition , lack of education ( girls pulled from school after 5-6th grade ) . 
  there is lot of criticizeable stuff there without aspects of criminality being involved . 
   so long as they know they can leave and that there is a world outside of their community then i guess i 'm ok with it . 
  what if they are raised to fear the outside world ? 
   there 's not that many roma people in romania ( ~ 600,000 according to the 2011 romania census ) unnoficial estimates place the number at around 2.000.000 , and most romanians agree that number is closer to the truth . 
   it 's people who subscribe to the romani culture who are a problem . 
  depends on what parts of romani culture they subscribe to . 
  there are a lot of gabor roma who are quite conservative ( patriarchal , isolated from wider comunity , arrage marriages for their children at an early ages , little education , especially for the girls ) but are functional members of sociaty more or less . 
  they are skilled craftsmen , ( tinkers and such ) , and rarely cause trouble if ever . 
  ( some of them are embracing evangelical christianity and are abandoning arranged marriages and keep their kids in school longer ) . 
  from what i 've read , the finnish gypsies are somewhat like that ( keep a lot of customs , but do n't cause a lot of trouble and work ) . 
  now there are other gypsies who are half-assimilated and live in the periphery of big cities . 
  the traditional roma look down on these roma as lesser beings . 
  these are roma who have more in common with `` ghetto culture '' than `` roma culture '' . 
  or better yet , it 's a mixture of the bad in both ( thuggishness combined with disconnect from wider society ) . 
  the idea if you get rid of a `` bad roma culture '' things can be fixed is really an oversimplification ( though it does have a grain of truth ) . 
  but the roma are a very heterogenious ethnicity , and there are different problems with different subgroups . 
   the support system for kids without parents is , admittedly , pretty awful in most places , but would you rather be in a care system like that with some kind of a future a head of you or trapped in a life of squaller and crime with your genetic family . 
  i do n't think kids raised in orphanages in romania have a better chance at life then those raised with their roma parents , tbh . 
  honest question : do you think amish children should be taken away from their parents ? 
  i ask because a lot of traditional roma are similar the amish ( patriarchal , isolationist ) . 
   she threatened to `` punish '' us because we were we were tired paying for romas holidays with our tax money and not actively cheerleading for mass immigration this is bullshit and you know it . 
  what she said is that you ca n't kick out a group of people from france because of their ethnicity . 
  if you want to kick out the gypsies , you have to do it on a case per case basis provided they have broken the law . 
  if they have n't , you ca n't kick them out just because they are gypsies , as that would breach eu law . 
  and breaching eu law is why you would get `` punished '' .

  years later , the same village is invaded by stray dogs . 
  the mayor goes to the witch again , and receives a tiny blue dog with the same instructions . 
  he places it in the middle of the village , and all dogs promptly queue up behind the tiny blue one and leave the village .

  - hey ...

  let me remind you that in 1939 romania was allied with poland and france . 
  after what happened to poland and later to france and mostly after the [ soviets occupied ( 1940 ) what is today republic of moldova ( bessarabia ) then part of romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_bessarabia_and_northern_bukovina ) , there were very few options for romania and none of them was `` allied with soviet union '' . 
  hitler [ badly needed ] ( https://youtu.be/oet1wag5sfk?t=455 ) the romanian oil fields . 
  so the options for romania were : 1 ) end up under german panzers like poland ( still better than under soviets ) 2 ) be friendly to germany and you might get bessarabia back ( even better ) . 
  i think you understand now how we became `` allies '' with hitler, 
   roma or romani is the name that their political and ngo organizations prefer and the name that we preferred they would n't use at all !!!, 
  in romania like in many eastern european countries they were called tzigani since always and it was so well associated with their identity and `` culture '' that it became a derogatory term . 
  now they are thrashing our name . 
  in less than 8 years of roaming through eu they managed to convince basically everyone that the romanians are thieves and beggars .

   also greece did heavily overspend . 
  this is not relevant to your argument . 
  give me proof the 100 billions were used in the interest of greece and not the interest of germany , like you said initially . 
  the interest of greece was to declare bankruptcy and restructure their debt , not to take additional debt . 
  the interest of german banks was to `` extend and pretend '' that greece can return them money which they obviously did n't have while their national income contracted ~ 25 % . 
  why would we make the effort to learn latin when almost everybody knows a little of the most spoken language of the world : bad english ? 
   that is why greece got bailed out with more than 100 billion euro [ just for your information ] ( https://youtu.be/cca68u3p_z8?t=1680 ) greece was not bailed out . 
  deutche bank , bnp paribas , societe generale and others were bailed out by germany using greece as an intermediary . 
  also you see that `` billions of euros every year are poured into eastern european infrastructure '' but you do n't want to see the same billions of euros coming back to western europe as payments to the western companies who win most contracts and also you fail to see that there are additional billions of euros borrowed by ee from we banks and are paid to we companies for the same infrastructure .

  i specified the preconditions quite clearly : `` as long the most profitable companies in ee have predominantly we shareholders . . '' . 
  your rant is off topic . 
  i 'm not going to even read it . 
  i think when it comes to swearing , we are totally slavs  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmw-bxaempw, 
  i think it 's funnier than google can translate , 
  i 'm always fascinated by the dutch culture . 
  the way you kept your deep connection with the nature . . at least the mushrooms & `` herbal '' part of the nature if you know what i mean . . 
   yeah . 
  cuz i bet you 'd rather have becali as your boss than ghosn . 
  provocative crap . 
   it 's simply because there 's a difference in gdp no need to over complexity things . 
  not necessarily . 
  the profit repatriated by renault , societe generale , gdf suez and auchan from romania goes to french people even though that profit is part of the romanian gdp . 
  so even if by an economic miracle romanian gdp grows larger than french gdp , a large share of the wealth will continue to go to the french shareholders and the romanians will not feel at `` the same level '' as the french even if they will work and produce more .

  it 's the same story as with the american gold rush . 
  towns appeared , prospered , then disappeared after the gold was gone . 
  people in these towns need to either move to other towns , or learn a new trade . 
  learning a new trade does n't guarantee a job in the old mining town since new jobs can not support the same population from when coal mining was booming . 
  france has always had employee friendly regulations . 
  the economic problems are mostly due to technological shifts in the industry and people that are mostly unwilling to learn new things . 
  there are lots of coal towns , that ran out of business decades ago , which are still asking for coal jobs to return . 
  that 's not going to happen . 
  you can stimulate the economy by stimulating investments in new jobs , not old ones . 
  that 's exactly macron 's policy . 
  lepen 's policy is to blame everything on immigrants . 
  she literally has no plan to fix the economy . 
  thanks . 
  that 's a vague statement , bro . 
  what mistakes are you referring to ? 
  also , can you predict the future ? 
   but obamacare was hugely unpopular , it 's one of the reasons he was elected , to replace it . 
  trump fucked up with trumpcare . 
  big time . 
  obamacare is now more popular than ever . 
  [ the rise of obamacare : why is the aca so popular ? 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39157793 ) lots of people that voted for trump did n't even know that obamacare and aca are the same thing . 
   as for the economy , wrong again , it was doing okay under obama , it is soaring under trump , markets are at all time highs . 
  it 's soaring because of what obama did . 
  trump 's economy policies have n't even passed congress . 
  trump did n't change anything yet . 
  [ u.s. economy in first 100 days of trump looks a lot like obama economy ] ( http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-economy-under-trump-looks-a-lot-like-obama-economy-2017-04-23 )  more to the point , trump has also only been president for two-thirds of the first quarter . 
  ** most of his economic policies are still being shaped or debated in congress . 
   yeah because the economy is doing poorly in the u.s under trump . 
  let 's not forget the more than monthly islamic terror attacks ... oh wait , that 's france  the economy was doing ok when obama left . 
  ** trump is taking credit for what obama did with the economy . 
  ** [ trump keeps taking credit for obama-era economic news ] ( http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-keeps-taking-credit-obama-era-economic-news ) trump gave tax cuts to the rich so they are getting richer .

  [ article ] ( http://www.primanatura.ro/geamana-satul-acoperit-de-un-iaz-de-decantare/ ) in romanian . 
   if you 're interested in the debate you could honestly just watch the 5 last minutes . 
  both candidated get 2 minutes to speak freely and it sums up the whole thing perfectly . 
  is there a video ? 
  the brexit negotiations are n't going well for uk so theresa may is demonizing the eu in an act of desperation . 
  if the brexit negotiations fail and no deal is struck , the election , that she called for , will not go so well . 
  ** her reputation and her party 's reputation are on the line . 
  ** they 're literally copy pasting what erdogan did before the turkey referendum . 
  it 's sleazy as fuck . 
   is n't that the point of brexit ? 
  the point was to gracefully leave . 
  now the uk is stoking people against the eu because they 're failing at the brexit negotiations table . 
  this all stinks of desperation on the uks side . 
   there is no point comparing ourselves with the usa . 
  usa = united states of america eu = european union so it makes no sense to compare state unions economically ? 
  sure , they 're different . 
  but that 's an extra reason to compare them to see who fares better based on those differences . 
  still no tax returns from trump , though . 
  and i 'm not even going to mention trumpcare . 
  how exactly is the eu influencing the election that theresa may asked for ? 
   in a speech outside downing street , the ** prime minister - who has been accused by labour of stoking a confrontation for appearance 's sake ** - said the european commission had hardened its position to coincide with the 8 june poll . 
  oh , wait ... it 's the other way around . 
  theresa may is just projecting . 
  low energy ... 
   look at the polls ni voted to remain after brexit . 
   yes i do remember the attacks i suspect you have very simplistic view of what it was about though . 
  yeah . 
  they 're `` happily married '' . 
  you are now contradicting yourself . 
  this discussion is over . 
   the eu are looking to cause instablitiy and mayhem to take our focus of brexit negotiations , by stoking irish nationalist flames . 
  ni first stated that they did not want brexit and that they wanted to remain in the eu as per their brexit vote . 
  the eu reassured them that this can still happen even if the uk leaves . 
  that is all . 
  you 're taking things out of context and manipulating them to attack the eu because the uk is losing the negotiations . 
  it 's obvious and sad . 
   i 'm blaming them for trying to highten tensions . 
  the eu offered ni reassurances . 
  the uk offered false accusations and cheap attacks in order to get free trade . 
  it 's not happening , so you 're getting desperate . 
  you 're not fooling anyone . 
  this discussion is over . 
   more like going up to a happy married wife the uk and ni ? 
  happily married ? 
  holy shit , you 're out of touch with reality . 
  remember all those violent attacks from pro and anti irish extremists ? 
  yeah ... that 's not being `` happily married '' . 
  you 're delusional . 
   that 's what we 're trying to stop the eu from doing !, 
  that 's not what the eu is doing . 
  the irish have always had a strong nationalist sentiment . 
  you 're now trying to blame it on the eu . 
  that 's the point you 're missing . 
   accusing others of what exactly ? 
  `` stoking irish nationalism '' this is really getting old . 
   we 've recognised the issue of the violence for example and came up , with the roi , the good friday agreement . 
  good . 
  now leave them to decide on their own and stop using them as a brexit negotiations bargaining chip . 
   you have a very one dimensional understanding of the relationship between the uk and ni . 
  are you trying to say that everything is peachy and that the violence in the past is nothing to worry about ?

  even here on reddit you are bombarded with opposing views non-stop . 
  let 's not pretend that it 's the same as reading a newspaper . 
  fact is that most people like one or two newspapers or tv channels and they tend to watch those almost all the time . 
  on the internet you get all the views you want like you 've said , but you get them all . 
  yeah , no , that 's not true . 
  if you 're somewhat interested in politics and approach it with some amount of critical thinking you 're probably ahead of most people already . 
  just because they 're older does n't mean they 're more knowledgeable , most people know fuck all about the economy or how the state runs . 
   hurr durr where do muslims live in peace see ? 
  this is what i 'm talking about . 
  you 're a poster child . 
  are you seriously implying they do n't live in peace anywhere ? 
  we have a minority of muslims in the south east of romania and yes they live in peace , they 're very well integrated . 
  in fact , they live in peace in most places because most muslims are n't actually violent or criminals , hard as it would be for you to believe . 
  i hear that conservative nationalists are not particularly science friendly either . 
  some parties even deny climate change . 
  it 'll indeed probably become more pretentious and unpatriotic to say something about liking science . 
  `` god damn scientists stealing our jobs with their climate change non-sense '' . 
  that 's really not the essence of our democracy , as it is a representative one and not a direct democracy . 
  there are some elements of direct democracy such as referendums , but those have always been held under specific circumstances , in this case the fact that 52 % of britons wanted to leave the eu is not necessarily the best of things , as people easily change their minds and taking such a huge decision for the future with such a small majority that could disappear any day is called doing a terrible job as a politician . 
  cameron just took a huge risk to satisfy his personal interests of first getting into power and then maintaining it , and he has failed spectacularly , achieving the result he really wished would n't come . 
  this is a huge fail in politics , cameron fucked up bad . 
  do n't be surprised if in the next years you 'll keep hearing more and more people think that the uk fucked up . 
  a politician is n't your best friend , he 's there to take decisions , some of which negatively affect some people . 
  it 's not so much about trust as it is about capability , because without capability , the results are going to be chaotic and dangerous . 
  governing a country and setting its policy is n't something you do emotionally based on uninformed opinions . 
  that 's a lie , i doubt most of you are aware , just like in most other western nations . 
  also , maybe the reason why you think that nearly all the ones that come there are gypsies is because that 's all the news shows you and that 's all you see . 
  you see a romanian guy and you assume his british , you do n't even think twice , but then you see a gypsy and many of you think `` fucking romanians '' . 
  it 's true and you know it . 
  let me ask you something . 
  say you were a politician , say you 're one of the decision factors in a representative democracy , bestowing you with the responsibility to take the best decision you possibly can take for your country , in such a situation if you know the people are wrong , even if they are the majority , then what do you do ? 
  because to me it seems like it 's your responsibility to know better in that situation . 
  people elected you for a reason , and the reason is n't to be a spineless coward that does something blatantly damaging to the country just because people are pissed . 
  of course it comes off as arrogant , but damaging your own nation and going down in history as the guy that knowingly fucked up the nation is rather not what you want to be . 
  it 's not condescending , it 's realistic . 
  the education system of most countries utterly fails much of the population . 
  school most often tells you what to think instead of teaching you how to think , that predictably leads to large swaths of people that are used to be told what to think by their parents or authority figures instead of using critical thinking and coming to their own conclusions . 
  that 's a real problem in most countries , so do n't think i 'm criticizing the british . 
  that 's great except if they wan na be like switzerland they 'll still have to adopt most eu legislation while getting none of the say of what happens inside the eu . 
  it 's like putting yourself back in the same position that you hated before , but now you do it with even less of a say in the matter . 
  yeah but as always people only see the downsides . 
  a migrant might take up a job , but he might also create two in the process , but that 's much harder to quantify so it was n't for the leave side to consider . 
  same with the net contributions that the uk makes into the eu fund and so on . 
  presenting a simple `` truth '' is easy and it 's enough for many to be swayed , presenting a complex answer on which not even experts can all agree on or predict with total accuracy is n't , though most do agree that both inter-eu immigration and eu membership bring net value . 
  i live in romania thank you very much , blaming merkel for all of europe 's problems is so fucking stupid it 's not even worth a reply , yet here i am taking the bait . 
  first of all the migrant crisis did n't happen because of fucking merkel , it does n't matter how you personally interpreted it , because those refugees were already well on their way here . 
  second of all , this is a big one , so pay attention , the british had a hard on against immigrants long before the refugee crisis even happened , their whole `` the romanians are coming '' shtick has been going on for way longer than any kind of crisis and the hate and vitriol has been real for years now . 
  farage famously announced last year how millions of romanians will flood the uk once work restrictions are lifted , it was a big deal because everyone sat waiting at the airport for the hordes of romanians to invade the uk and all they got were a few families that came there to work . 
  whatever , it 's not worth having a discussion with you , i 've seen your type of rhetoric on reddit countless times already , you have absolutely no mind of your own and you 're just repeating soundbytes about `` merkel is destroying europe through soros ' multicultural agenda '' here , you can read it from the very mouth ( hand ) of a briton : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4pkt01/uk_votes_to_leave_eu/d4mkckn so how much longer will you keep blaming merkel for the general xenophobia and ignorance of the leave side ? 
  in great britain most people believe romanians = gypsies , so yeah , fuck off , because i unlike you know what i 'm talking about . 
  ignorance is by far the biggest issue . 
  yeah , i 've been repeating this all over reddit for the past 2 days . 
  people keep pretending it 's about the refugee crisis or whatever the fuck , but the britons had a hard on for ragging on us long before that . 
  most of you think that romanians = gypsies . 
  nuff said . 
  yeah i agree with that , i was just pointing out that the rivers were n't overflowing with milk and honey back then either . 
  it 's just because i see this myth very often on reddit about how the boomers had it so good , in truth part of their selfishness comes from the very fact that `` good '' was much more limited than now . 
  as a general trend there was a lot of economic growth during their time , that much is true , but that 's also due to some unique contexts . 
  i 'm only saying this because i think people need to have a more realistic view and expectations . 
  old people have grown up in a different world , they were always going to be more conservative and nationalistic than we are . 
  the only real way to `` defeat '' them would 've been if young people would 've gotten off their collective asses to go and vote , because many did n't , you ca n't stop old people from voting however they wish , but you ( not you personally ) can get up your own ass and go vote in order to make a difference . 
  i 'm curious what the turnout was for the under 30 group that is heavily pro-remain . 
  it was stated from the very beginning that the scope of the eu , eec or whatever the fuck you want to call it is to bring about ever more unity and integration . 
   imo the fast expansion has not been a good idea i dunno , it seems to me that it was a great thing . 
  there might be a problem though when most westerners for example think that all romanians are stealing gypsies . 
  do n't even try to deny it , most people think romanians = gypsies , the examples go on forever . 
  the whole position of the leave side is based on shite generalizations and misinformation . 
  350 million pounds to the eu per week my ass ... 
  it 's all going to go to the nhs my ass x2 ... 
  is it really democratic when most people vote based on how they 're told by the rag they like to read because `` they 're the only ones tellin the truth !! '', 
  i mean the amount of misinformation and straight out lies has been staggering , it 's clear that most people have not voted in full knowledge , rather they did so based on shitty propaganda and scaremongering . 
  that 's why people are saying the referendum was a bad idea from the very beginning . 
  the issue is so complex and yet the election was decided on emotion . 
  pretty sure most western nations forbid it . 
  good thing we have the official results now so we can make such determinations . 
  those polls did n't ` swear on me mums lyfe '' , in fact many polls have shown leave to win , while the last one has shown remain will 52:48 , hardly such a big deal you 're making it out to be . 
  it was obvious that the results are going to be tight and tight they were . 
  britons have been ragging on about how `` romanians are coming '' and taking their jerbs long before any whiff of the refugee crisis . 
  it 's always the others , those that the masses deem as inferior . 
  it does n't matter whether we 're talking about islamists or eastern europeans , the hate was very present in both cases . 
  we have representative democracy not direct democracy . 
  there 's very good reasons for that as explained by the other guy , but i 'll give you another one : the reason why direct democracy sucks is simply because it 's the equivalent of choosing the most average man you can possibly find and make him take all the decisions , from financial to international policy . 
  do you need more convincing than that ? 
  and when i say average , i really do mean average , i do n't mean average in your circle of friends or average in london , i mean the kind of average where you know that like one third of the population does n't know if the moon is closer than the sun to the earth or where 1 in 5 british teenagers do n't know whether churchill was real or not . 
  representative democracy works better at the moment for us because at least theoretically our elected leaders are way above average in education , knowledge and administrative capabilities . 
  the biggest problem seems to be an image one . 
  people are imagining shady fucking people doing backroom deals on how to fuck over the common man . 
  in reality the eu works pretty democratically and it 's a helluva ambitious and interesting project , but their marketing is just horrid and the image of the eu has taken a real beating ever since national politicians realized they can blame the eu for everything going wrong in the country to dodge any kind of responsibility . 
  many eastern europeans take jobs that most westerners are n't even willing to do . 
  it 's a cultural problem in much of the west , kids have been raised to believe they 're way too good for menial jobs and that they should all be doctors and engineers . 
  that leads to a lot of people that do n't really want to work because they expect more than what the world is willing to offer them . 
  you know , i just remember today how i used to be really into science and nature and stuff ever since i was a kid , i used to watch documentaries for fun . 
  i was n't more than 7-8 years old in age and even back then felt that i could n't really relate to most adults about that stuff , because most of them are n't interested in any of that and do n't know much about it . 
  well , i was right . 
  i probably knew more shit about science and nature when i was 8 years old than most adults , is that cringy ? 
  because to me it 's just sad that like a third of the planet could n't tell you whether the moon was closer to the earth than the sun . 
  it 's the same regarding this as well , it really does n't take much knowledge to realize just how little grasp most people have on the matters at hand . 
  why do you think tabloids have such a huge success for example ? 
  when do you think most of your immigrants came to britain and where from ? 
  basically what you 're saying is that despite the fact that we 're no longer in 1960 , somehow you 're going to make things be like they were in 1960 .

  i do n't think the rest of the people who did that for almost two weeks need any kind of `` exercise '' after it . 
  i confused catalan with romanian for at least 5 minutes when i stumbled upon a catalan movie on tv .

  avoid your generation mistakes . 
  have some understanding for serbs or muslims . 
  and so they should have for you !, 
  and all of you for us hahaha :d, 
  i 'll sue a serb in no time and since i have internet i 'll sue the judge too if he 's an idiot !, 
  if you have problems p.m. !, 
  do you really need to call names on people ? 
  hahaha it 's because i kinda know albania ( i love it ) and i guess you felt some need to insult me ... especially since you live in the west ( ? 
  i understand you ... 
  i 'm from a minority too . 
  i just say that if someone oppressed someone else on any kind of base there it can be filmed these days . 
  does n't it ? 
  no , what you 're talking about is another nation 's interference in a sovereign nation business . 
  if you do that serbia will do it and we gon na have a war . 
  let 's avoid it , 
  it 's not nice to downvote me while we talk  look up and see what we 're talking about my albanian friend , 
  who 's oppressive on who ? 
  there 's eu law and internet and phone cameras . 
  everyone can just film or record an abuse . 
  i doubt a war is a good thing for anyone . 
  edit : thank you for your downvote ( whoever you are ) !, 
  war is absolutely a good thing . 
  are you pleased now ? 
  talk to eachother . 
  it 's the only solid solution . 
  war gains are only temporary . 
  a reaction will always cause a counter reaction . 
  and so on and so forth and ... . until we have another war were people die and party leaders have a sun bath in ibiza . 
  serbian and croatian and sometimes bosniak leaders are hand in hand to milk you dry and make you kill eachother only for profit !, 
  oh but you 're wrong ... russia would love a war there . 
  it 's something which will made people look away from their craps in ukraine and syria ... and a little debauchery is good . 
  not to mention how many criminals can just die in a war instead their prisons etc etc etc edit : excellent hahahaha, 
  i said * almost * sice they are in majority there . 
  i doubt croatia would do anything without eu or nato backing . 
  hey ... 
  i 'm not some pro republika srpska fan girl here . 
  i just say how i think it will be . 
  we ai n't in the '90s are we ? 
  i really never understand that hate anyway . 
  we could cope here , hungarians and romanians and you could n't !, 
  are you sure croatia will send its army in a place where serbs live almost exclusively only to preserve another country 's existence ? 
  if so ... kudos for your courage guys !, 
  pork is necessary for us to live ... and some turkey/chicken meat for me ... , 
  i do n't think croatia will do anything if eu say no . 
  imo of course . 
  indians will be very upset on bosniaks now !, 
  me too since i do n't like cow meat at all :d edit : we really should made a thread . 
  what 's the best ... beef , pork , mixed ... etc seriously !, 
  this sound very like here . 
  unfortunately : /, 
  pork meat ? 
  ** this **, 
  in my opinion if eu will go down in the next years ( not going to ) we in the east will be at the mercy of our ex-communist kleptocracy . 
  i dunno about croatia but we do n't want that here again !, 
  what 's that ? 
  that 's why i love eu . 
  it made borders meaningless between eachother . 
  if nato or eu wo n't care . . it will be a very short war and you know it . 
  e : war not was, 
  you were n't insulted by my first statement ?!, 
  damn : ^ d i 'll do it for a day of backpacking tour since i 'm not very capable financially to stay over night ... at least not without my dad 's money lolol,

  the climate is worse here than there in the winter and first 2/3 of spring . 
  with few exceptions ... like today  it 's beautiful outside today !, 
  where 's mine ? 
   `` hot '' sun of march damn ... and i expect cold days of april and/or `` lamb 's snow '' . 
  greece here i come !!!,

  now that we are done with sensitivities , i 'll answer seriously : you do not have national identity you only have pride . 
  your history is non existent , you are a teenager culturally . 
  your people lack any form of modesty and are incapable of looking at history from an objective point of view . 
  your country is build on the sweat , tears and blood of those who cannon defend themselves , you have never been a democracy and are the closest example there is to a plutocracy since the roman empire . 
  i 'm guessing you asked to know if you could integrate into the more ethnically pure parts of europe , so i 'll answer , you can , but , like the coloreds you are running away from , you will live and die and white nigger , a peasant from the colonies . 
  i recomend australia or new zeeland . 
  bucharest * - it 's none of your business cluj napoca * - you should mind your own business * i tend to meddle in other peoples business, 
  oh the bearskin hat , military genius, 
  i think it 's a violation of human rights . 
  if there is a war and you kill someone , you are a state enforced murderer , if you die , the state is guilty for second degree murder . 
  we do n't have it , but the simple concept of being incorporated in a government i detest makes me sick . 
  the euro would get a huge boost in importance due to the size of the lse . 
  this would encourage japan and china to consider switching to the euro for international stability and transnational efficiency , yes this would be a issue for the dollar , as a huge volume of dollars is used outisde the us , a lot of that money will return to the us , which can create a very strong inflationary pressure . 
  but nothing the fed ca n't handle . 
  it 's not really that easy , beyond the `` another strong economy '' there is the issue of a imense increase in monetary volume which could have inflationary effects due to the faster monetary speed of the british economy . 
  but it 's going to flat out over time . 
  the issue with greece and spain is productivity relative to the interest rate , money is to cheap for compared to how much people actually produce/add value . 
  this combined with an inefficient and wasteful government that gets easy money and has no interest in being fiscally responsible gives you a social economic puzzle in which the euro is just a piece . 
  i would be against the euro in general without a unified banking system , capital would be to hard to track monitored and controlled . 
  sweden , embrace the social utopia . 
  schadenfreude towards russia and sympathy towards ukraine case . 
  we easterners hate russia because it 's the last historical bully that fucked us all trough history . 
  we invented anguish . 
   what are your thoughts on this ? 
  should governments do something ? 
  can governments do something ? 
  should they wait until the situation is as dire as china or india ? 
  should we just leave it and see what happens ? 
  over a certain level of wealth/education/consumerism / existentialism people stop having babies . 
  so overpopulation in the long term is a a non-issue . 
  no , governments should never intervene in anything , from study to effect it 's a convoluted path managed by idiots . 
  they did in china and every socialist `` utopia '' that ever existed . 
  we wont reach that level , at least without government interventions or a cultural shift . 
  also bangladesh is much more tragic case . 
  yes , please . 
  what are the differences between arabic and islamic ? 
  why wouldn you count it as asian ? 
  to call the remnants of traditional africanism distinct cultures would undermine the cultural genocide we did during the colonial age . 
  you could separate them by west african , central african , saharian and south african , but that is forced because they currently have more european traits in common than distinguish them . 
  islamic = / arabic ?? 
  am i missing something ? 
  also it 's oringin is in asia so i already accounted for it subsaharian is arguably individual cultures , colonialism erased anything valuable and the post-colonial cultural shock never really subsided . 
  i do n't know of a african country tha is not defined as reactionary to a european influence . 
  thank you , have an internet beer , my treat :d, 
  if you 're white you can blend in fairly easy . 
  but this is n't a european thing , it 's a asian thing . 
  jk  acceptance and integration are 2 different things . 
  an american expat could struggle for tens of years to meld into the local culture that accepted him from the start as a odity . 
  an educated iraqy may be a doctor and a pillar of his community and still be viewed as a non-national by some `` standards '' . 
  excellent , i think / r/mapporn would also like it, 
  maybe quebec . 
  the us is more of a extension of english culture , but if you go that far , the only non-european cultures would be the asian ones . 
  why is n't there a distinction between immigration policy and vagrancy ? 
  nationality should not be an issue for beggars , rapist and thieves , if people have no income , pass an anti-vagrancy law and do n't use positive discrimination when it comes to crime . 
  problem solved , the racists wo n't have bad examples to complain about and the liberals will get diversity through educated immigrants seeking an honest life . 
  honest immigrants will be more peaceful and wo n't have to be ashamed of the bad apples , and criminals will learn that crime does n't pay . 
  it 's literally a win-win-win-win ; i really do n't see the problem . 
  how dare you sir ? 
  this is europe , we will have written words even after the zombie apocalypse . 
  but seriously it 's faster , more convenient , and i find it helps you tink . 
  any religios conexion or is it only a nationalist movement ? 
   re trying to bring back the nomadic culture of the `` mighty magyar tribe '' including the shamanism , the old hungarian alphabet and such . 
  i am so sorry , i had no idea it 's that bad . 
  do average hungarians support it or just accept it ? 
  ( average hungarians as in not racist delusional bigots ), 
  [ c'est arriv\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de chez vous ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103905/ ) - probably the only film shot in a handheld style i do n't hate, 
   the internet , remarkably , . . no need to get snarky , we 're just talking `` men and women do have lots of brain areas that are the same , '' geary tells webmd . 
  moreover , members of both sexes excel at skills that are commonly labeled gender specific . 
  `` all of these things have overlapping distributions . 
  there are many women with better-than-average spatial skills , and men with good writing skills . 
  and considering the uneven distribution of male to female writers ( one of my gender anguishes ) , you kinda start to wonder maybe biology is n't a defining factor . 
   gender actually has a fairly large hand in how a child develops on a biological level . 
  and i thought my penis appeared spontaneously and by magic , but seriously nobody is denying the biological difference but biological diversity overrides in practice that aspect . 
  if the worst man still had better spacial awareness than the average female , you would have a case , also there is the element of brain plasticity , a trained female not only overcomes biology but actually has statistically no performance differences from trained males . 
  ( this is why affirmative action is bullshit ) . 
  but we are talking about ...  cognitive pursuits at an average level ... ... and in this case , all of the above are n't relevant , decision making is a cognitive process that has little to do with actual ability ( in the average person ) . 
  but rather with self interest and unconscious biases , which are influenced by social constructs . 
  this is just my opinion from what i observed in a misogynistic ( traditional ) country , that was forced into egalitarianism by communism . 
  so almost complete equality from a legal framework but still uncomfortable ( both from males and females ) culturally with gen 2 feminism . 
  so your millage may differ . 
  we are talking about cognitive pursuits at an average level right ? 
  i do n't see how much effect can testosterone have on a 14 year old boy 's desire to pursuit engineering ; considering the lack of it , does n't effect fields like acting . 
  the argument can be made that for long term success in those fields a hormonal edge can make a difference , but that negates how much of a persons career is affected by chance . 
  to be clear i do n't think anybody is discouraging women from technical pursuits , but in general we do praise women faster for less academic effort when they 're young , and math which is the foundation of technical fields requires a lot of effort , this effort/reward imbalance makes women be said of technical fields and by the time they get the opportunity to choose a field they find at beast they have an apprehension toward math , at worst they have an academic gap that is very hard to jump . 
   not because men and women are designed to think differently at a biological level . 
  you are disregarding the brains plasticity . 
  but this is an argument i rather not start , at least not here in / r/askeurope . 
   god forbid a man wants to be a stay at home dad . 
  just things like that . 
  europe is n't the place for that kind of progressiveness either , there are legal frameworks in a lot of countries but your neighbors will still look down at you . 
   70ish percent of sexually dressed characters in media were women , i do n't think i have ever seemed a female on italian tv that is n't drop dead gorgeous . 
  both females in the media and in real life are pressured to look their best , this is quite predominant in the west of europe , more along the lines of nyc rather than south beach and the further east you go , culturally we start to look like montana . 
   every teenager is an ` activist ' , all the while new double standards are being set up to counter the old ones , thereby creating more problems . 
  welcome to the 21 ` st century !, 
  its going to get a lot more retarded before it gets better . 
  now most women will empathize with `` feminist ideas '' and publicly support them because they are n't stupid . 
  it 's not really a big issue and if you do n't paraphrase a problem using the f word , they will agree with common sense . 
  european women actually deal with a conservative social norms ( in the south and east from what i know ) , but they are n't militant and a lot of them are conforming to traditional gender roles . 
  and those who are n't are using their equal opportunity to gain social equality . 
  what particularly aggravates you , the militarism or the actual emancipation ( like wearing revealing clothes ) ?

  given that barnier probably chose his own team , i expect that most of them would also speak french . 
  that does n't mean that they will speak in french to the brits . 
  of course not . 
  this is about the language that they use to talk inside the eu team . 
  the vast ( meaning 95 % + ) of the documents produced by the institutions are ( firstly ) in english and that 's not going to change substantially , with or without the brits around the table . 
  the eu bubble in brussels is mostly english speaking and that 's not going to change either . 
  i doubt it .

  blood . 
  we just drink blood . 
  but maple syrup welcomed . 
  :-) but really now , i do n't think there was hate , rather some annoyance with people reproaching us that we look for our interests . 
  and you know , it 's hard to hate canadians . 
  cheers from across the pond !, 
  yes , maybe , but that was n't the point and neither romania nor bulgaria asked that . 
  canada only said it is open to negotiate the lifting of the visas after romania threatened some months ago that it would block ceta . 
  they did n't do it out of their own initiative and they would n't have lifted them if it was n't was this threat/block . 
  there was no piss match . 
  the romanian authorities 's job is to fight for the right of the romanian citizens and this is what they 've done . 
  they reached a diplomatic compromise to solve a problem . 
  it eliminates one of the stumbling blocks in the signing of a trade agreement between canada and a 450 + million strong market . 
  so yes , it matters . 
  that was the compromise . 
  romanians wanted it to be sooner ( e.g. 
  1 january 2017 ) , canadians wanted it later . 
  that is just a bad argument . 
  criminals are the last people to be hold back by visas . 
  we are talking here about a trade deal . 
  there are many legitimate trade and business interests that romania has in and in relation to canada . 
  if together with your eu peers you 're going to sign a trade agreement with a third party , it 's very legitimate to ask to be treated in the same way as your peers . 
  and speaking about criminality , yes , there are romanian and bulgarian criminals in europe , like there are from many other countries . 
  i wish there were fewer , as i also wish that the dutch ports would not be the main entry gates for hard drugs into europe . 
  half of the cocaine taken in europe comes in through rotterdam and no , that 's not just because rotterdam is a big port ; the vast majority of ecstasy taken in europe also comes from labs mostly in the south of the netherlands . 
  sure , though not stated , that was implied in my answer . 
  of course not , but the romanian state could have done a better job over the last decades ( hell , more than 100 years ) in order to have a better country i.e. 
  with less people willing to emigrate . 
  there are long term factors that make romania be on that visa lists , not only the last 5-6 years . 
  you do n't think romania has business people ? 
  this is a trade deal , trade is done mainly by business people . 
  you are drawing exactly the wrong conclusion here . 
  this is happening exactly because member states have asked that the ceta agreement is considered a mixed agreement and not one only under eu competency . 
  this raised the need to have agreements from all the eu member states and their parliaments ( with a high number of them in the case of belgium ) . 
  and btw , lovely list you have there.e.g . 
  belgium -40 % of its population , the uk which soon wo n't be a member anymore and not a party to these agreements . 
  the other answer you receives explained why you wo n't be able to get as good a deal as ceta/ttip if you negotiate from a national position . 
  trade agreements are done between markets . 
  if you are a small market you get a lousy deal . 
  there is a reason why the eu negotiates as a whole . 
  yes , i said the same thing some comments above . 
  i do n't know the exact figure and ca n't find it quickly now but i see that the romanian overstays rate in us is between 2 and 3 % and double the rate for russians . 
  the romanian president has just declared that romania is ready to lift its reservations for the signing of the agreement if it manages to reach a reasonable agreement with canada for the lifting of the canadian visas in 2017 , and not in 2018 ( i understand 2018 was the last proposal from canada ) . 
   think things work like back home , where it 's not really important to follow the rules too much . 
  i get your point and i do n't want to have a long discussion on this , including because i had it the last time this subject was prominent here . 
  i am certainly not the only one saying that the visa refusal rate is a rather unobjective and fairly arbitrary standard , because it is based on decisions made by consular officers rather than the actual behavior of applicants . 
  people ( applicants ) are judged for what they might do , not for what they 've done . 
  we are talking about officers that have to watch out and identify '' possible immigrants '' from poorer countries and that can not be a purely objective judgement . 
  even your message shows that biases and stereotypes are easily part of the equation ( `` think things work like back home , where it 's not really important to follow the rules too much '' ) . 
  i am not challenging canada 's right to decide on its own immigration/visa policy , i am just saying that visa policy is not clean cut science , no matter how many numbers we want to put on it . 
  like i said above , i regret that we got to this point , and i hope both that the ceta agreement will be signed and implemented and that romanians will soon be able to travel visa-free to canada . 
  we threatened we would do this , sure . 
  i just wonder if we would have taken the decision to actually do this if we would have been the only ones staying between the other 28 and the signature of the agreement . 
  i was n't referring to the government . 
  look at the first comment from alecs_stan . 
  i have seen many other similar ones on this topic . 
  i understand the government taking the position that it took . 
  we could speculate whether they would have taken this position in the absence of the opposition from wallonia . 
   canada 's fault that too many romanians get rejected well , as i mentioned in another comment , one can have a whole discussion about this point . 
  of course there is no plan against romania , but the decision to reject a visa application is taken by canadians , not by romanians . 
  i think it 's not realistic to assume that this is a totally scientific/objective process . 
  the romanian authorities can also not appreciate much the fact that some of your regions aggressively advertise emigration to canada for romanian doctors and engineers while somebody with the '' wrong '' ( or no ) diploma can not visit canada because e.g. 
  they already have a cousin living there so are more likely to be refused a visa . 
  ok , thanks . 
  i know that in the case of the us visas it 's also about overstaying . 
  i was referring to both cases . 
  there are many good reasons for signing treaties but the moment one decides to veto something also necessitates wisdom , especially when dealing with allies . 
  the visa reciprocity is an agreement between eu member states , one in which canada has n't participated . 
  the eu has pressed canada on this and romania and canada have made some steps forward on this with the issue now being mainly one of timing ( e.g. 
  when the visas would be lifted ) . 
  the problem should be treated with wisdom , not by worsening the relations we and the rest of the eu have with canada , which would happen if the eu would impose visas on canadians . 
  from what i know it 's both , visa refusals and visa overstaying . 
  of course , we can talk about the objectivity of the system in case of the refusals but that is another ( connected ) discussion . 
  all i 'm saying is that we should n't just jump and blame other europeans that they have n't supported us enough . 
  we can also ask ourselves if it 's fair to ask from the other eu national leaders to worsen the lives of their citizens ( by having visas imposed on them ) because we and our leaders have n't been capable to develop a better country , one in which people would want to come , not to leave . 
  the eu in this case means the eu member states . 
  do you expect germany or france to impose visas on the us and canada , and thus get us and canadian visas imposed on them because romanians need visas ? 
  the losses would be in the billions and the transatlantic connection would be weakened , to the loss of all of us . 
  if you are looking for culprits , one can also blame the romanians themselves , that after 20 years of living in a free society , are still overstaying/being refused their us/canadian visas in too high numbers . 
  if romanians would n't run away from romania in such high numbers , those visas would have been lifted years ago , without the need of the eu to intervene . 
  yes , i 'm afraid it is like that . 
  though the romanian government is in favour of free trade and wants to continue to have very good relations with canada , i am also asking myself how can we sign a free trade agreement if our business people ca n't even travel freely to canada as their counterparts from the other eu member states ? 
  i think it 's really regrettable that we got to this point and i hope that the situation can be solved soon . 
  no , he did not . 
  he is widely respected for his role played as president of the european council . 
  exactly . 
  there was info that 2-4 of them used the route , not the majority of them . 
  and salaries and taxes to romania ( ns ), 
  that is sad .

   how can you even be this insecure about this . 
  again , i 'm sure this is a tactic that works in your kindergarten . 
  using big statements and concentrating on the opponent rather than on the subject ( exclusively or in great proportion ) to attract the support of fellow 5 year olds works great in uneducated mediums . 
  often enough , arguments do n't matter if enough people are shouting `` you are cancer '' ( unrelated example , ofc . ), 
  see here 's where you 're wrong . 
  canada , for example , has no citizens , as all the people inhabiting it are a mix of english and french long term tourists . 
  the usa has 0 americans , as americans do n't exist . 
  there are about 70mil irish in the world and so on . 
  this is clearly the way to look at things . 
  so let me get this right . 
  to you , americans do n't exist . 
  all non-native citizens of the americas are french , spanish , irish and so on ? 
  like i said : those who were born in romania are romanians , even if they have hungarian ancestry . 
  if they wanted to move to hungary , they would 've , so clearly those who stayed want to . 
  if there are people with hungarian roots living ** unhappily ** in romania , they should either move or realise that they 're idiots that have options to solve their problem but ca n't be bothered to do something about it . 
  as for the land aspect . 
  it 's ours , not yours . 
  even if you believe it should be yours , the fact is that it 's ours at the time i 'm writing this . 
  notice the frustrated tone that accompanies blunt statements without backing on your side and the calm tone on my side . 
  this is the exact situation in small parts of transylvania : some dudes with big mouths do some attention whoring and everyone ignores them after they fail to understand counter arguments . 
  this being said , i will also take the general approach and end this conversation , as you and your side have failed to provide any information or opinions of any value to support your cause . 
  no , `` you are cancer '' does not hold any value in a debate outside hungary and league of legends . 
  i am truly sorry you did not have the chance at proper education . 
  i 'll pray for you . 
  cheers . 
  yes . 
  i 'll trust your assessment on the quality of arguments . 
  in other news , we 're not leaving our lands ( at least most of us are n't ) . 
  if you want it , come and get it . 
  let 's see how that works out . 
  there are no tensions to inflame . 
  if you want to be in hungary , the border is open . 
  if you 're still here , you 'll deal with it . 
  you overestimate the importance people give them . 
  unless they 're at least 100 years old or have moved from hungary to romania after their birth , they 're not hungarians . 
  it 's been a century . 
  if they were so upset with the situation they had plenty of time to leave . 
  those who are here chose to stay . 
  this ca n't be inflammatory . 
  as for useless , it 's as useless as celebrating the national day . 
   at most local news . 
  part of the aim of these kinds of events are to attract public attention to something or another or to encourage nationalism . 
  if this should make at most local news , what is the `` at least '' option ? 
  it 's also noteworthy that your comment is this bad after you edited it ; i ca n't begin to think about it 's original value . 
  most of the time you can show up to the station and buy the ticket . 
  i believe that the last ticket can be bought 5 minutes before the train arrives . 
  edit : i would not recommend buying the ticket 5 minutes before the departure . 
  if you get there an hour early you should be able to get a ticket in 95 % of trains , the other 5 % being full . 
  i do n't understand the part about the ticket and the reservation . 
  you buy a ticket and you get assigned a seat . 
  as for advice : [ this is the site you need ] ( http://www.infofer.ro/ ) . 
  on the left you can select the date , time , departure and arrival location and it will create a list of all the trains you can take and the price of the ticket . 
  regio trains are the worse comfort wise and go slower and stop at every station imaginable . 
  interregio are better . 
  if you 're a student you get a discount if you have something that proves it . 
  i 'm pretty sure this works even if you 're a student at a foreign university . 
  leg room is usually a problem so do n't be tall . 
  ( best advice ever , i know ) while some trains have ac , i would not recommend risking it during the day at 35 degrees c. do n't fall asleep if you travel alone because you never know . 
  there 's not much that 's different from trains in other countries . 
  this is actually a larger scale problem . 
  old people ( and adults over 40 ) vote more and , as the west has a aging population , they hold the majority of votes . 
  i know things are n't great right now in spain , but was n't it getting better ? 
  i might not remember correctly . 
  yeah . 
  this was over a long time ago . 
  better luck next time , dude . 
   i like to change the subject when it does n't go my way anymore . 
  maybe he did n't understand that i 'm mad ... what can i do ? ... i 'll just make more stupid statements without basing them on anything . 
  that will show the world i 'm smart . 
  no , my friend , we wo n't take you back . 
   asks about a highway he knows does n't exist , but the other guy gave a good answer  asks a better question about highways after looking at google maps . 
   he answers the question . 
  ... scratch the highway questions , they 're ineffective . 
  ** i 'll use my french charm ** , jk , i 'm also an immigrant . . where from ? ... moldova of course . 
  i hate people who make jokes about moldova but i myself make jokes about vaslui ( part of moldova ) . 
  i 'd be surprised if you could list all the countries in europe . 
  i 'm not even getting into placing them on the map , deciding what country is the moldova of europe would be way too much to ask . 
  you 'd need facts and data and that makes your brain hurt . 
  `` willingness to work '' is bolded for a reason . 
   but i guess the dumb circlejerk is stronk . 
  true . 
  ** as dumb as it gets ** . 
  you 're the third one to cherry pick that comment saying the exact same thing and ignoring the rest . 
  ** this ** is the comment . 
  you could 've quoted this part and bold the important parts you 're going to refer to , but why would you do it in the correct way when it gives you less of an advantage in defending mighty bacau and co. `` there are cities that are more successful than others ( bucharest , cluj , timisoara , constanta etc ) and , due to the success of these cities and others like them , certain regions are wealthier than others . 
  proximity to the west , quality of infrastructure , number of people , their education and willingness to work ( ... moldova ) , population density and land price are also important factors to consider . '', 
   i 'd be less critical as you are , considering that romania is the moldova of europe . 
  that 's the attitude they teach you not to have at the best uni 's in iasi . 
  if nobody opposes the general opinion that if moldova does n't get infrastructure , there 's nothing we can do than we 'll be in the same position 10 years from now . 
  you have cheap labor and tax exemptions . 
  companies move across continents for those things . 
  in hungary you mean ? 
  as close as moldova will be to the new romanian highway . 
  i 'll prepare myself for the economic boom . 
  the exact same number as there are between timisoara or cluj and bucharest . 
   as i said it 's minority . 
  of course . 
  i did n't phrase my idea correctly . 
  [ yes . ], 
  ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/romania_historic_regions.svg/2000px-romania_historic_regions.svg.png ) there are cities that are more successful than others ( bucharest , cluj , timisoara , constanta etc ) and , due to the success of these cities and others like them , certain regions are wealthier than others .

  i would agree with you that absorption was a strong possibility in the parliamentary system . 
  but know with the presidential system i think it 's lower . 
  the individual now matters more then the party . 
  a person from a new small party , can make huge gains in the presidential elections by himself , much more than his party could 've done in the parliamentary system . 
  this is exactly why i said '' what is needed is a new right-wing party '' . 
  the chp brand is quite toxic for many , but a new leftist party wo n't help , not in the current situation . 
  chp while toxic has hardcore followers , who 'll always vote for it . 
  if a new leftist party is formed , instead of chp getting 25 % , you 'll get 2 parties both getting around 10 % . 
  a further fracture of the left is not the solution . 
  a leftist party will further divide the leftist opposition . 
  chp needs to drop ideological purity and become a big tent party , with people who agree on basic things like : rule of law , freedom of press , independent judiciary , basic leftist economic policies ... etc a new right-wing part is needed . 
  erdogan basically has a united voter block that has no alternative . 
  mhp under bahceli is a joke . 
  he ca n't die quickly enough . 
  '' coalition of chaos '' excuse . 
  in the previous parliamentary system , for the opposition to win , it would require a chp-mhp-hdp coalition . 
  good luck getting nationalist voters from mhp and akp to support a coalition with hdp . 
  this is why i said erdogan was blinded by power . 
  the presidential system is a 1-on-1 battle . 
  the party , coalitions ... etc are meaningless here . 
  i 'm not a leftist , not at all . 
  but , from all i saw , i actually kinda liked hamon . 
  he looked like a decent fellow . 
  i disagree with him , but i could n't really dislike him . 
  i think the poor lad just ran in the worst moment . 
  macron stole the center-left and the far-left went with , the more charismatic , melenchon . 
  poor hamon ... 
  wish him luck . 
  violence is n't the answer either though, 
  all irrelevant now with the presidential system, 
  and akp is dominating istanbul and ankara , where the gdp is highest . 
  i am not speaking of economy here . 
  pretty cool , honestly . 
   do n't forget to prep the \u00e7omar bull when he comes to fuck your wife . 
  how lovely . 
  more polarisation wo n't work . 
  you ca n't '' intimidate '' people out of voting erdogan . 
  i know that '' returning to our roots '' is a big opinion among some chp voters , but i do n't think it will have the results these people hope . 
   just today a picture of the party 's chairman holding a banner that says `` god commands justice '' was posted nothing wrong with this . 
  secularism = / = non-religiosity . 
  you ca n't turn the clock backwards to the 80 's and put the '' genie back in the bottle '' , to say so . 
  this is the electorate that turkey has , you got to work with it . 
  you ca n't fight it . 
  really lovely , to see the pictures and see that there are people of all ages and backgrounds , puts a bit of a dent in the perception , which erdo paddles and sadly many westerners bought into , that chp represents '' the elite '', 
  it will get pretty big , true . 
  erdo can rage as much as he wants , he 'll do nothing . 
  i was a bit skeptical in the beginning but i think , considering the current situation , the march was a decent idea . 
  props to kilicdaroglu and all the organizers . 
  i should get some photos soon , a friend of mine will join them soon !, 
  edit : just saw [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/mstanrikulu/status/881160541456277504 ) , to good not to share !, 
  a group of '' anti-capitalistic '' muslims joined the march ... 
  finally . 
  the serbs can enjoy a balkan shitshow without being involved in it . 
  we had 39 % lol . 
  it 's standard in most of the area . 
  completely true and i do agree . 
  my comment here honestly was on the future and comparing the turkish army to the arab ones , saudis more exact , and how it compares to them . 
  i found one of these in every eastern european country i traveled to . 
  it is truly something that unites us ... 
   that 's because they feel threatened by ikhwan though exactly . 
   they have no qualms about running the most backwards legal system around for example . 
  absolutely , but this is n't really relevant to the current debate '' saudis anger at qatars funding of muslim brotherhood and similar groups '', 
   i understand but the gcc alliance largely agree iran is destabilizing the gulf and they have all been happy to fund jihadis and islamists during the recent civil wars the uae does n't really fund militias anywhere . 
  oman has no part in this madness . 
  kuweit also funds no groups , and have a neutral position many times . 
  bahrain is a saudi puppet . 
  qatar also has decent relations with iran . 
  the only place saudi has funded jihadists is syria , mostly nusra , but i doubt funding is the same since the qatar rift . 
  nusra is very friendly with qatar . 
  in the other regions , such as libya and egypt , even yemen . 
  they support mostly secular anti-iran autocrats like sisi , hafter in libya and hadi in yemen , before he betrayed them and allied with the houthis they supported saleh . 
  i think i was n't clear enough , the saudis and the uae , to a lesser extent , will of course support anyone that 's against iran , secular , islamist ... etc but on the muslim brotherhood and similar groups they have always been quite consistent on their dislike of them, 
  not really , the saudis and uae do n't want more extremist propaganda , they want less islamism . 
  the saudis/uae really , really hate islamists , like the muslim brotherhood , that qatar backs . 
  hell they both supported the secular factions in egypt and libya , sisi and hafter . 
  they simply see islamism as a threat to their rule and legitimacy . . edit : really do n't see the reasons for the downvotes , but oh well . 
  they did n't really gave it all against al-bab , also the arab fighters where poorly trained and equipped . 
  the purges did affected them , getting rid of so many officers/generals will do that . 
  i do remember that some retired generals from the mid 2000 's got called back to replace the purged gulenists . 
  and couple of kemalists generals where , recently , found not guilty of planning a coup in 2005 , when erdo and the gulenists first purged them . 
  they 're still much , much better than any army in the region . 
  the iraqi and syrian ones are just destroyed at this point and besides them no arab army can compare to the turkish one . 
  they are made to parade and police their own people , not to fight . 
  regardless it 's a silly debate , there will be no direct fighting . 
  what does this have to do with anything here ? 
  it 's not 1.5 mill there are at most half a million . 
  they simply got an extension to their stays there . 
  with purges or not , it 's still 10x better than any arab army , especially the saudi one . 
  i know , but there was a twitter hashtag trending saudiwithkurdistan , couple of weeks ago . 
  there are plenty who like qatar , but plenty of people who 'll blindly follow the governments views . 
  aj arabic literally had a '' debate '' on whatever shia genocide is the solution to the problems in the region . 
  while biased aj english is fine and i do n't support shutting it down . 
  neither hippie leftist aj + do n't compare aje and aja . 
  one showed the protests in bahrain as legitimate and criticized the bahraini monarchy , the other one called the protestors '' rafida scum '', 
  yes . 
  whatever opinion of the iranian people , the regime is trying to create puppet states everywhere they can . 
  even abadi , the shia pm of iraq is accusing the iranian backed militias of trying to weaken the state so they can effectively rule the country . 
  same with hezbollah in lebanon , the dozens of militias they have in syria . 
  and to a lesser extent the houthis , but they are a lot more independent than the others . 
  yeah i did ... sorry .

  - only 4 countries were against it and one accepted the quota despite initially voting against . 
  sorry bud , taking 2,4 k refugees to help overwhelmed italy and greece does n't qualify as `` tyranny of the majority '' . 
  but hey , no worries , if you do n't want to take any , just accept the sanctions . 
  and before you ask , i would n't have any problem with romania being sanctioned if they did n't participate . 
  we 've been sanctioned before for other things , we 'd live . 
  - you have n't been paying attention , have you ? 
   the relocation plan applies to asylum seekers `` in clear need of international protection '' ( those with a recognition rate higher than 75 % , i.e. 
  syrians , eritreans and iraqis ) and  only documented asylum seekers with a high chance of having their applications successfully processed are relocated from greece and italy . 
  and then we accepted the quota . 
  your point ? 
  refugees are n't illegal immigrants . 
  they are refugees and geneva signatories have a responsibility towards them , as it is underlined in the lisbon treaty . 
  man , what fucked up drugs are you on ? 
  this is some twisted shit . 
  then they will be send back because they are not german registered . 
  sure , just accept the consequences then . 
  how many isis terrorist attacks did greece have since the refugee crisis ? 
  because it was agreed upon ? 
  lol . 
  i think that it 's bullshit that the czech republic took part in a democratic vote , refuses to accept the result and acts like a petulant child when it is told they will face sanctions . 
  that 's what 's bullshit , mate . 
  do n't bother . 
  there 's always a rage boner in these threads and they will downvote you no matter what you say . 
  countries like czechia will not pull out of the eu because they would crush and burn . 
  if there were doubts about uk , there are n't any about czechia . 
  if czech people ca n't handle a democratic vote then idk man , the problem ai n't with the eu . 
  but you will handle it , be it by taking in the refugees or by being sanctioned . 
  however , since you mentioned it , i 'd really like to see how the czech parties would sell an exit to the public considering how much of a disaster that would be for you . 
  yeah , okay , but we did change our mind , did n't we ? 
  we could have been like the others who outright refused just as they did when they voted . 
   `` i still believe the mandatory quotas are not a solution to europe 's migrant crisis . 
  but the number of refugees romania must receive is not large . 
  it is manageable and i think romania must show solidarity , '' iohannis said ahead of an eu meeting in brussels to coordinate responses . 
  well , i mean , there are authorities that have to manage the program and if poland would have agreed to their quota , they 'd have as many refugees as those authorities would have managed to resettle until now . 
  i ca n't give you a number . 
  though luck for him then . 
   imo in legal deals like this , there is no space for motivations or nonobjective factors . 
  so how many refugees does poland have to take for it to be `` ok '' and who gets to decide that ... 1 ? 
  the number of refugees are calculated for the size and economy of the country . 
  i think you were supposed to get around 6k . 
  no , not really , unless there 's proof that they were systematically avoiding the accommodation of these refugees in the agreed time frame which i do n't think it 's the case here rather than a miscalculation of how long it 'll take to do this thing . 
  the rest have agreed not to do it at all so that is not up for discussion anymore . 
  maybe , but they 're willing to do it . 
  maybe it takes more time than it was agreed upon , but at least countries are working towards making it happen rather than flat out refusing to share the burden . 
  yes , i do . 
  eu is n't all about fun and games , they have obligations too , especially when issues have been voted on democratically . 
  i would n't be mad if romania was sanctioned over this if we refused . 
  european unity is n't just about the good things , it 's also about sharing burdens . 
  of course many are seeking countries which might offer more benefits , but as long as a court says x country , although not as wealthy as y country , can decently hold these many refugees , with almost everything paid from the eu budget , then they can be held in that country even if they do n't like it . 
  as you can see , our own refugees , over 1k , are doing nothing controversial . 
  sure , some might complain , but that does n't matter as long as they 're safe , not abused and can live decently . 
  new parties than maybe . 
  with some more progressive youth in it . 
   on 22 september 2015 , european union interior ministers meeting in the justice and home affairs council approved a plan to relocate 120,000 asylum seekers over two years from the frontline states italy , greece and hungary to all other eu countries ( except denmark , ireland and the united kingdom which have opt-outs ) . 
  the relocation plan applies to asylum seekers `` in clear need of international protection '' ( those with a recognition rate higher than 75 % , i.e. 
  syrians , eritreans and iraqis ) -- 15,600 from italy , 50,400 from greece and 54,000 from hungary -- who will be distributed among eu states on the basis of quotas taking into account the size of economy and population of each state , as well as the average number of asylum applications . 
  the decision was taken by majority vote , with the czech republic , hungary , romania and slovakia voting against and finland abstaining . 
  with the minor correction that after voting against the quotas , romania changed its mind and accepted its quota . 
  another note would be that although denmark has an opt out , they did take in refugees . 
  you can make agreements with neighbour countries , like the one we have with serbia , that if a refugee that is registered in romania runs to said country , said countries ' authorities will send them back . 
  i think no authority will argue that it is against human rights to stop refugees from all going to one place simply because that place wo n't be able to manage them all . 
  from my point of view , if a refugee is placed in a safe country where he is n't discriminated and he 's offered all the rights refugees normally have , he has no right to protest that . 
  they are refugees not tourists . 
  they do not get to choose , do you understand that ? 
  romania is a safe country and they will be placed here ** because otherwise other countries will be overwhelmed ** with too many refugees . 
  they are not on vacation , they will be placed where eu says they 'll be placed , with some exceptions where families can be reunited . 
  and the authorities in every country will follow the laws and agreements they make as a country . 
  it is not rocket science . 
  no matter what i say i 'll be downvoted because there 's a rage boner going on around here so i wo n't even try . 
  my country , your country , all countries except 3 accept the refugees quota . 
  i do n't want these 3 to get away with not accepting it , especially since two of them are actively creating tensions within the eu . 
  they either accept it or face consequences . 
  they do n't get to cherry pick this . 
  exactly . 
  it 's 2,6 k people , not a big number at all . 
  you wo n't even know they 're there most probably . 
  all of them except 3 agreed to this . 
  well , they 're refugees for one . 
  they wo n't just be left to wonder . 
  they will be identified and accommodated in certain places where state workers and ngos will help with their integration process . 
  if some of them run , those who work and volunteer there can report it to the police . 
  then the border patrols can keep an eye out . 
  if they do manage to escape the country , they will be sent back , the same type of agreement romania and serbia has . 
  refugees in serbia try to run to romania , romania sends them back . 
  it can be done . 
  yep . 
  abuse them . 
  that 'll show the refugees , the unhrc , the eu , juncker and all your imagined enemies . 
  just three . 
  romania changed its mind . 
  this is what was agreed upon tho ... to build new projects without all the members being forced to sign up for them . 
  it was the whole thing about the eu `` finally doing something '' . 
  eu could have forced them all to do sign up , to erase the multispeed , but that would have spiked the euroskepticism even more . 
  i do n't know what 's the best way because one side will always be angry . 
  well , i guess there 's more factors there ... sweden has its euroskeptic side and they probably think that if there 's any corruption case like that , their authorities can handle it . 
   hungary is not in the eppo there are two types of countries which are n't in the eppo : - the ones who do n't need it like sweden iirc . 
  - the corrupt ones who do n't want to get in trouble . 
   hungarian prime minister viktor orban railed against the european union , going as far as accusing it of siding with `` terrorists , '' but said he wo n't lead the country out of the bloc . 
  what a clown . 
  bark , bark , mr. orban .

  in the 80s , ceausescu started to slowly reinstate marshall antonescu ( as he was a nationalist dictator like him ) so these two big ` arguments ' against the king started to merge/complement each other . 
  yes , you are right . 
  legally , politically etc. , romania is not a monarchy anymore and there is no legal framework regarding the royal house . 
  but there is a draft law to recognize them as ` legal entity of public utility ' and fund their activity from the budget but it 's not clear if this will pass . 
  king michael is the one that is most respected , but he is also very old and ill . 
  if he dies soon , which is likely , support for the royal house will decrease significantly as his daughter , princess margareta of romania , is far from having his stature . 
  we 'll get our first f-16s this september ( not adapted to use nuclear bombs but i guess that can be changed ) . 
  anyway , they wo n't move those nukes here , if any . 
  my bet is they will remain there . 
  only the current polish government might want them , most of the other cee countries do n't want nuclear weapons . 
  we/they would be happy to get us/nato conventional forces . 
  this was savage . 
  garlic is actually one of the most smuggled agri products , though in this case it might have more to do with what user ` source-direct ' was saying . 
  see here this story about two brits being arrested for it . 
  ` who , what , why : why do criminals smuggle garlic ? ', 
  yes , significantly bigger share of rural population than in bulgaria . 
  as you see in the article , their mandate is reached by consensus , meaning russia needs to agree with everything ; because that is how the osce works , every member has a veto . 
  if russia did n't agree with them having binoculars , do you think they agreed with them being 24/7 there ? 
  there are huge areas in the donbas , close to russia 's borders , where the russians do n't event allow the osce observers to go . 
  guess why ? 
  that is the system we have , the aggressor gets to have a say over the conditions in which other people can observe his aggression . 
  did spain actually ask for nato help ? 
  i know the incident but i do n't remember the nato dimension . 
  thanks . 
  the military of montenegro currently maintains a force of 1,950 active duty members . 
  using 1.63 % of the country 's gdp . 
  i hope wikipedia is wrong but i remember seeing similar figures some months ago . 
  kind of puts those 1.63 % into perspective . 
  i 'm all for positive stories about romania , and there is a positive story to tell economy-wise , most of the info on that appears to be correct , but i also have doubts about authors that regurgitate this crap : `` part of why the u.k. voted to leave the european union last month was to escape punitive taxes and regulations -- indirect taxes -- imposed by unelected officials in brussels . 
  british voters recognize the fact that policies of envy have stifled growth and innovation . '', 
  in principle i think it would be a good idea . 
  but for that to happen you need to stop the nationalistic we-are-the-descendants-of-the-ancient-macedonians crap , solve the name issue with greece and any other significant dispute you might have with them and with bulgaria , implement the reforms needed/finalize the negotiation chapters , and then sure , you are welcome . 
  and yes , romania , a country with many problems , which many think should n't have been accepted into the eu , also has a say on this . 
  old women in romania , moldova , ukraine and probably other countries around , mostly in the countryside , wear the scarf , mostly in this form . 
  all married women were suppose to wear it . 
  what do eurocrats have to do with this ? 
  the guy had received asylum in bulgaria , it was the first eu country he entered . 
  germany should have sent him back to bulgaria the moment he applied for asylum in germany . 
  they did n't because he had mental problems ( as if those mental problems would have disappeared if he stayed some more months in germany . ), 
  picking on the eu for things which are under the control of the member states is uninformed , unfair and unhelpful . 
  there are many types of reforms , some more ` reformist ' than others . 
  strange . 
  i thought i put it . 
  thanks . 
  though i am from transylvania and familiar with ( some ) hungarian names , i 've never heard about many of the first ones . 
  rik\u00e1rd\u00f3 , armand\u00f3 seem to be of latin ( o ) / spanish/italian inspiration . 
  krisztofer , dzsenifer , vanessza are adaptations from english , no ? 
  a bit strange for a nationalistic group to prefer this sort of ` foreign ' names . 
  might have to do with the level of education/social strata supporting the party ? 
  and indeed , our gypsies are also the ones with the most ` original ' names , some much , much worse than rik\u00e1rd\u00f3 or armand\u00f3 . 
  what are the traditional most - ` jobbik ' - liked names ? 
  just curious . 
  thanks . 
  sorry , ca n't help on that .

  the perpetrator looks to be a 17 year old from afghanistan who came to germany as refugee . 
  you can imagine how this will affect public opinion regarding this issue . 
  you do n't need to have attacks in your country in order to be affected by terrorism . 
  terrorists also travel through romania , terrorist financing originates or moves through romania , romanian citizens are affected by terrorist attacks taken place elsewhere , romania gets to host refugees because of terrorist attacks taken place elsewhere etc. . we were also not directly affected by the somali or the angolan civil wars but we sent un-mandated peacekeeping troops there , and in many other places . 
  being a stable and richer-than-the-world-average country comes with the responsibility to try to stabilize other places and to fight the scourges affecting our planet . 
   democratic system of checks and balances i agree though there is hardly any `` democratic system of checks and balances '' in turkey . 
  i am sorry for all the democratic and liberal turks . 
  depending how bad it will be , i expect many of them to leave the country . 
  i 'm close to the council building and sometimes i go in there but that 's some serious '' getting yourself into jail '' thing so nope , nope , nope . 
  looks very interesting , thank you . 
  indeed , why learn from other peoples ' mistakes when you can just repeat them ? 
  are you aware that ulpia traiana sarmizegetusa and sarmizegetusa regia ( the one in or\u0103\u015ftiei mountains ) were two different cities , located in two different places ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarmizegetusa_regia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ulpia_traiana_sarmizegetusa, 
  there are many innovative ways in which the buildings can be showed e.g. 
  transparent panels though which one can see both the ruins and the reconstruction on top of them , holographic projections which recreate the buildings on top of the ruins . 
  these are used in other places . 
  building on top of the ancient ruins was something done in the xix and first half of xxth century and is generally regretted . 
  it 's invasive , fake and destroys/covers part of the ancient ruins . 
  the colosseum and the ruins of pompeii were largely still standing . 
  the ones of ulpia traiana sarmizegetusa do not . 
  it will be clear that it 's a replica . 
  this way they can leave some doubt , and partially fake it that it 's the real thing . 
  i am getting depressed . 
  `` the project has received all the necessary approvals , and the documentation to get eu funding has also been submitted . '', 
  should n't there be some eu regulations saying clearly what you are and what you are not allowed to do ? 
  i really would have liked those buildings to have survived the centuries ( beyond the foundations ) but they have n't . 
  that is the reality . 
  there 's nothing much really standing there . 
  reconstructing them entirely on site is stupid and frankly should n't be allowed . 
  it would make the place look fake . 
  that is an ancient site , it should n't be made to look like some theme casino/circus/movie set or fun-fair . 
  the remains should be preserved and protected , not massively built on . 
  i am worried about the result as my fellow romanians seems to be more interested in having something '' spectacular '' than in thinking innovatively about other ways to present the ruins/ancient city . 
  you are right , it looks that way . 
  stupid , stupid . 
  for somebody who knows so little about these things you really should n't express yourself in so strong terms . 
  what you say is just wrong . 
  sorry but how is the title not reflecting the title or content of the link ? 
  there was an arson attack , and yes , a hateful one , because there are no neutral or friendly arson attacks . 
  i resubmitted the link only with the title of the article and i see that one is removed as well . 
  why ? 
  yes , slight . 
  is it incorrect , though ? 
  was it a friendly arson attack ? 
  almost all the gypsies living in romania are settled and they 've been settled for many decades if not hundreds of years .

  it 's easy to judge . 
  it 's not that easy to figure out a viable solution . 
   do you think the west and east would trust each other more if they did n't have to address this issue ? 
  yes . 
   do you think importing outside cultures without rhyme or reason wo n't drive up nationalism ? 
  the `` importing outside cultures without rhyme or reason '' rhetoric is what 's driving up nationalism and xenophobia . 
  they are not `` imported '' . 
  that 's false propaganda . 
  they come here from war torn and impoverished countries . 
  this has always happened during times of war . 
  read the [ statistics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_germany#comparison_with_other_european_union_countries ) . 
   according to eurostat 47.3 million people lived in the european union in 2010 , who were born outside their resident country which corresponds to ** 9.4 % of the total eu population ** . 
  of these , 31.4 million ( 6.3 % ) were born outside the eu and 16.0 million ( 3.2 % ) were born in another eu member state . 
  immigration is a natural part of human evolution . 
  it has always been . 
   but its simple logic that improving the chances of success for the smugglers will lead to more smuggling . 
  that 's not the point . 
  you ca n't blame the actions of the smugglers on the ngos that are trying to help those that are being smuggled . 
   yes i do , that 's exactly why i said terrorism was a thing before 2003 . 
  the gulf war started in 1990 . 
  al-qaeda started their terror attacks in 1992 . 
   on december 29 , 1992 , the terrorist group al-qaeda detonated a bomb at the gold mohur hotel in aden , yemen , where united states marine corps would be staying while on their way to somalia to participate in operation restore hope . 
   what do you call people that make a claim and instead of backing up that claim , attack the person ? 
  do you feel insulted , bro ? 
  why ? 
  because i asked you your age ? 
   in this context , comparing me to a 6 year-old is quite ironic  so i 'm the 6 year old because i actually bring arguments backed up by facts ? 
  i 'm more and more convinced that you are a 6 year old .

   bro , if we would have 500k dead we would have our shores full with dead bodies . 
  if the boat sinks near the shore , yes , this does happen . 
  [ refugee crisis : toddlers and children wash up dead on turkish beaches after at least 39 drown in latest boat disaster ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugee-crisis-toddlers-and-children-wash-up-dead-on-turkish-beaches-after-at-least-39-drown-in-a6843691.html )  yes they do . 
  in collusion with smugglers that provides the boats . 
  these are serious accusations . 
  where 's your proof ?

  i think that you can find plenty of rednecks and hillbillies in romania , too . 
  same here in romania ; the `` legionari '' ( members of the fascist iron guard ) became `` communists '' after wwii and they built the infamous securitate and ceau\u0219escu 's nationalist policies . 
  the friendly grammar fascist, 
  in romania , we say that the only two neighbours with which we never had a war are serbia and the black sea . 
  bavaria had both communists and nazis . 
  the bavarian communists declared their communist state , but nazi freikorps quelled the revolution and executed thousands of communists . 
  the americans did their best in the denazification program and they ended up religious conservatives . 
  for some countries , yes . 
  bulgarians , for instance , have less `` slavic '' genes than the romanians . 
  ( where slavic genes are defined by the genes of the polish/western russians ), 
  a bit more about the old names of romanian neighbours : * nem\u021bi -- germans ; occasionally , the name of the city or region used ; for instance lipscani < lipska ( the slavic name of leipzig ) . 
  * \u021aarigr\u0103deni -- byzantines , people from \u021aarigrad ( constantinople ) , from slavic \u0426\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0300\u0434\u044a * fr\u00e2nci -- western romance people ( italians , french , etc ) * s\u00e2rbi -- south slavs ( including bulgarians ) ; many bulgarian immigrants called themselves `` serbians '' so they would n't be expelled back to the ottoman empire south of the danube . 
  * arva\u021bi -- croats * le\u0219i -- poles ( singular `` leah '' ) * arn\u0103u\u021bi -- albanians * t\u0103u\u021bi -- slovaks * rusnaci -- ruthenians ; ukrainians * muscali -- russians / muscovites, 
  an andorran friend said that they really love the catalans and that they are willing to help them in their war of independence against spain . 
  i 'm sure that the huge andorran army ( it has just one 12 men `` ceremonial unit '' ) would tip the balance toward the catalan side . 
  we always had a love-hate relationship with the russians ... after the 1878 war against the ottomans , they took southern bessarabia ( now part of ukraine ) and gave us dobruja . 
  we protested because we did n't want it . 
  in retrospect , that seems like a good deal . 
  are you sure that would be a good idea ? 
  the right-wing won every time in bavaria since 1946 and that might affect the politics of the whole germany . 
  but then , maybe national unity is more important than politics . 
  good luck in your quest !, 
   some historicians says poles are also genetically close to hungarians ( but that 's strange , our languages could n't be more different ) . 
  the hungarians assimilated the people they found in pannonia , which is why genetically they 're closer to their neighbours than to the other finno-ugric people . 
  it 's interesting that the most common family names in hungary include : * t\u00f3th ( slovak ) 2.1 % of all hungarians have this name * horv\u00e1th ( croat ) 2.0 % * n\u00e9meth ( german ) 0.9 % * ol\u00e1h ( romanian ) 0.4 % * r\u00e1cz ( serb ) 0.4 %, 
  as a romanian , our brothers are obviously the moldovans . 
  our cousins are the italians and spaniards . 
  we also have some special relationships with some neighbours : * bulgaria , we share too much with them ( culture , traditions , etc ) that we never get along . 
  * hungary , our `` arch-enemy '' , we share more with them than we want to admit * serbia , we consider them our closest friends * poland , it 's like that kind friend you really like , but you never get to see him as often as you 'd like ; as a random thing , a great-grandfather of mine hosted a polish refugee during wwii . 
  job satisfaction and prestige . 
  intellectual jobs give more satisfaction than repetitive hard physical work and they have a higher prestige . 
  in communist romania , a miner would get a bigger wage than the average engineer , who would get a wage only slightly ( maybe 20 % ) higher than the average . 
  did everyone want to be a miner ? 
  hell no , they had problems finding people to do that . 
  did any parent wanted his son to be a miner ? 
  no , of course not , they wanted them to be doctors , engineers , teachers , scientists , etc. 
  then why was n't everyone following higher education ? 
  because while all education was free , the number of places was limited through entrance exams and only the best in those exams could study . 
  czechoslovakia was far richer than romania in 1920 , it was far richer during the communist era and it 's richer now . 
  poland has been better run during the last 20 years , but the differences have been older than that . 
  your economy may have sucked during the 1980s , but it was still far better than what we had during the 1980s when ceau\u0219escu attempted his [ austerity policy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s_austerity_policy_in_romania ) . 
  there are differences in wages , but the prices are proportional to them , so those big paris salaries wo n't allow you to go much further in purchasing power . 
  ( just try to buy/rent real estates in paris ... ), 
  there are huge differences in purchasing power between social classes and between regions . 
  it 's not unusual for a programmer/engineer in bucharest to get more than 10 times the minimum wage . 
  on the other hand , in some parts of the country , more than half the jobs are paid the minimum wage . 
  the baltic countries are small ( my city , bucharest , has a bigger population than the whole estonia ) , so it 's easier to be a tiger and also they 're close to scandinavia , so they get plenty of swedish/finnish investment as well . 
  i ca n't see it happening during my lifetime . 
  i 'm 29 . 
  if romania were to have a gdp/capita growth rate that is 3 % higher than germany 's , we 'd need 55 years to reach its gdp/capita . 
  and this 3 % higher than germany growth is unfeasible : if anything , 1the gap is growing . 
  * 2008 : germany : 2.8 % ; romania : 7.8 % * 2009 : germany : -3.5 % ; romania : -7.2 % * 2010 : germany : 3.6 % ; romania : -2.5 % * 2011 : germany : 3 % ; romania 2.5 % . 
  * 2012 : germany : 0.9 % ; romania : 0.7 % ( estimates ), 
  we had quite a few high-level convictions for corruption during the last year , including former prime minister n\u0103stase ( for embezzlement and illegally funding the electoral campaign with state funds ) and former minister of finance decebal traian reme\u0219 ( for getting bribes -- reme\u0219 became infamous because the bribe included not just money and an audi q7 , but also sausages and p\u0103linc\u0103 ) . 
  dozens more trials of politicians and businessmen are taking place right now ( across the political spectrum , so it 's not political revenge ) . 
  almost every week there 's a new politician/businessman arrested : the latest arestee was last week , the owner of a local airline , who [ embezzled ] ( http://www.iol.co.za/business/international/romanian-airline-boss-arrested-1.1434976 ) some money that was supposed to be used for building a highway . 
  also the current government canceled quite a few contracts through which the romanian state was scammed . 
  for instance , the contracts with the `` smart guys '' in the energy sector , who bought electricity from the state-owned hydro plants for less than half the market price and they sold it on at market prices . 
  of course , there 's still a lot of corruption ( for instance , it 's a fair bet that 80 % of the ministers get bribes , kickbacks or preferential contracts ) , but it 's gradually getting better than before . 
  just the basques . 
  i do n't know much about the baltic pre-history , but at least in the areas where the indo-europeans settled in europe there were many and diverse `` pre-indo-european '' people : * in the balkans , the greeks called those people `` pelasgians '' and there is quite a lot of vocabulary in ancient greek borrowed from them , much of it related to the sea ( the word `` thalassa '' itself is of rather clear non-greek origin ) . 
  * the germanic and celtic languages have a lot of words of likely pre-ie origin ( including many seafaring words , the indo-europeans were inland people without any knowledge related to this ) * the etruscans in italy had a very developed civilization and the roman culture was based on it . 
  also , `` armenia '' used to be a lot bigger than what is now armenia . 
  [ a lot of the mediterranean coast ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:anatolia1200.png ) that now belongs to turkey ( the eastern part ) used to belong to the armenians . 
  it seems so : * mure\u0219 -- 23035 romani speakers * bucharest -- 3525 romani speakers, 
  well , in the south , there are more gypsies in the cities and therefore , more visible , hence the stereotype . 
  in transylvania , there a lot of roma in the rural areas . 
  a rural vs. urban gypsies by county map would be interesting as well . 
  i 've seen roma-speaking blond gypsies in bra\u0219ov . 
   anyway , in bucharest , i almost never see any roma speakers and if i see , they are typically gabors from transylvania . 
  it seems that the `` free '' gypsies of transylvania preserved more their language than those in the south . 
  `` rob '' ( < slavic \u0440\u043e\u0431 ) is better translated as `` slave '' than serf . 
  in romanian , `` serf '' is '' \u0219erb '' ( < latin servus ) or `` iobag '' ( < hungarian jobb\u00e1gy ), 
   what 's interesting is that i 've seen more \u201e blonde '' romas in transylvania ( where there was no slavery ) there was slavery in some parts of transylvania , mostly in areas that used to be fiefs or under the influence of wallachia ( bra\u0219ov , bran , f\u0103g\u0103ra\u015f ) or moldavia ( bistri\u021ba ) . 
  also , there are more blond romas in transylvania because there are overall more blond people in the general population . 
  what else do we know about them : * they came from northwestern india or pakistan , near the border * the group formed around 250 bc ( when it started to diverge genetically from the rest of the groups of the area ) * they left that area around 500-1000 ad . 
  * when they left they were a small group ( under a thousand people ) * initially , they were hindu ( based on words such as trushul = cross in romany , derived from trishul , shiva 's trident ) * they arrived in the balkans in the 1200s-1300s , where they were enslaved ; some were able to flee and spread throughout europe . 
  * the ottoman empire destroyed the balkan institution of roma slavery ( together with the whole pre-existing social order ) , with the exception of romania ( wallachia , moldavia ) , which were just vasals/tributary countries , not full ottoman provinces * in romania , the [ slavery of the roma people ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_romania ) was outlawed only in the 1850s by the romanian boyars who had studied in france and came with the ideas of the enlightenment . 
  * the largest holder of roma slaves was the orthodox church * most roma have a lot of european genes ; in some cases it 's hard to tell the ethnic origin ( there are even blue-eyed blonde gypsies ) ; in the case of the romanian roma , a lot of that admixture also comes from rape : romanian boyars used to keep roma women as sexual slaves . 
  actually , the estonians ( together with their finnish and hungarian cousins ) came to europe from the urals :  in recent times , linguists often place the urheimat , ( german : original homeland ) , of the proto-uralic language in the vicinity of the volga river , west of the urals , close to the urheimat of the indo-european languages , or to the east and southeast of the urals . 
  actually , norway is the biggest producer of farmed salmon , most of which is exported to the eu . 
  well , it was clear that this comment would be downvoted by both nationalists : * the hungarian nationalists , because it says that they 're not going to get transylvania . 
  * the romanian nationalists , because it talks about autonomy for the hungarians who live in transylvania . 
   i could mock romanians for not being anything like the citizens of the former spqr or roman empire , for being slavs with a latin fetish we are a strange bunch , half-way between the slavs and the latins : * we speak a latin language * we have slavic customs * we are half-way between the slavs and the mediterraneans in temperament * genetically we 're more slavic than the bulgarians and more mediterranean than the ukrainians . 
  in territorial disputes , the only thing that matters is the people who inhabit the land : 75 % of the inhabitants of transylvania are romanians . 
  while most hungarians live in mixed areas and cities , there is one area where the hungarian-speaking minority are 90 % of the population : the sz\u00e9kely land . 
  i support more autonomy ( on cultural issues and administration ) , but i 'm sure that too much autonomy is not even wished for now : the local authorities get more money from the central budget than the people in the sz\u00e9kely land pay to it , so fiscal autonomy would n't help them . 
  just a bit of etymology of the kissing words in romanian : the basic word for `` to greet '' in latin is `` saluto/salutare '' ( from salus , `` health , safety , prosperity '' ) . 
  the word got inherited in romanian as ** `` s\u0103rut / s\u0103rutare '' ** , but with a changed meaning : it means `` to kiss '' . 
  the word `` salut '' is in fact borrowed from french . 
  the other word for `` to kiss '' is ** `` a pupa '' ** , from latin `` pupa '' , girl . 
  cognates include french poup\u00e9e ( `` puppet '' ) . 
  a `` small kiss '' is ** `` pupic '' ** . 
   according to the census conducted in 1920 , the romanian population was 57,3 % of the population . 
  that 's correct , but that was after 70 years of hungarian policy of assimilation of the romanians . 
  the percentage of the romanian population was higher in 1850 than in 1920 . 
  well , these guys were serbs , who are not afraid to say it . 
  it 's hard to say what the austrians pegidans think . 
   therefore , far-right !, 
  extremists !,

   tunisia is not even comparable to turkey in any way . 
  i would say turkey is a good example of how tunisia would 've looked if ennahda , nt and the other parties decided not to compromise and work together . 
  that 's true . 
  completely agree with you . 
  i said just as much in another comment bellow . 
  that 's why i said that kemalism should also be updated to modern times . 
  a switch from the heavy focus on ethnicity to a more pluralistic society is needed . 
  though this does n't mean giving in to pkk , half of the kurds hate them altogether . 
  the forced assimilation policies must be condemned and abandoned . 
  and they must be abandoned towards the arabs in the south as well . 
  let 's not forget them . 
  chps recent efforts to fix relations is very welcomed and the right path ahead . 
  sadly for many kurds secularism and chp itself is very tarnished because of historical events . 
  hopefully trust can be rebuild . 
   do n't forget that akp voters are not non-nationalist i know . 
  but i do think turkish nationalism pushes people , the youth especially , to secularism . 
  mostly because of ataturk and the events around building the republic . 
  also almost 20 years under erdogan , will push most young people towards the anti-erdogan ideologies . 
  well speaking about scripture i would n't say so . 
  i would say they are as conservative as any other sunni . 
  the thing though , is that persecution from different states created the idea inside the community , that the state should n't persecute people . 
  because they know how it feels . 
  kinda like the mormons being pro-refugees , because they know how it is . 
  they 're not in europe . 
  it 's '' better together '', 
  you are right . 
  but if they would 've stood to gain from that war , they would n't have switched sides . 
  most muslims have no idea what sharia even is . 
  for many , especially poorer ones and less educated ones , sharia , in political terms , means : a more just governance , less corruption , pious politicians do n't steal ... etc. 
  of course they are wrong . 
  islamist politicians are as corrupt as anyone else . 
  then there is the personal side of things like : marriage , divorce , inheritance ... etc. 
  that many muslims nowadays associate with culture rather than religion . 
  and even in a secular law system , these things would resemble sharia , somewhat . 
  it 's not like they have another choice . 
  chp has a bad history with them . 
  although to give chp credit , they 've been very pro-kurdish in recent times , so much that they risk loosing turkish votes mhp : lol hdp : not every kurd is a separatist , and even if they want more autonomy , hdps connections with pkk pushes many away . 
  for many kurds akp was the '' lesser evil '' choice . 
  this is something else . 
  indeed sufis are sunni , should 've made it clearer , although they are a bit different than more traditional sunnis . 
  i did say in another comment : sufi '' sect '' . 
  to point out they are n't really a different sect altogether . 
  perhaps i should 've been clearer . 
  still , i do n't think , calling me a moron , was necessary ... 
  go tell that to a shia . 
  in one the clergy/church/mosque is separated from the political arena . 
  but religion still may play a part in the decisions of individuals . 
  from abortion , to gays ... etc like the republicans in the usa for example . 
  the other removes religion altogether from the public arena . 
  open display of faith is seen as bad , undesirable . 
  and religion must be pushed and contained to the home . 
  this is how i myself see it at least . 
  the french style of '' laicite '' polaryzed turkey . 
  you were either fully secular or full blow islamist . 
  the middle road , of normal conservatives , was removed . 
  turkey will always be a muslim country , no matter what . 
  but by doing this all or nothing system , it removed compromise and created mistrust among the 2 different camps . 
  i 'll give tunisia as a decent example . 
  main 2 parties are the right-wing , and former islamist party , ennahda and the left-wing , secular , nidaa tounes . 
  after great tensions , where all sides had a part of the blame , something of a consensus was reached . 
  ennahda dropped the '' islamist '' label because it hurt them , and became a party of '' muslim democrats '' . 
  nidaa tounes also softened their support of '' laicite '' and embraced a more american style of secularism . 
  this resulted in a common ground , were all parties could compete . 
  it is nt nowadays who uses '' islamic '' quotes to try and appeal to the more conservative people in the country . 
  they with their lefties policies try to chip away at ennahdas core supporters , poor , mostly rural conservatives , who may like the economic ideas of the left-wing . 
  in short they are saying : '' we are totally not crazy secularists , we are pious people too !, 
  please vote for us '' ennahda barely uses islamic quotes in official statements , as not to appear '' islamist '' and scare away a large chunk of the electorate . 
  they , with their center-right , free-market capitalism , try to chip away at nt 's core supporters , middle-class , mostly urban people . 
  who may like this type of economy better . 
  basically ennahda is saying : '' we are totally not crazy islamists , we wo n't bring sharia , we like secularism , we just dislike '' laicite '' . 
  please vote for us '' socially ennahda is still the conservative party , and nt is still the '' progressive '' party . 
  this kind of secularism however , removed the divides , mostly , and created a playing field , were the majority of people agree on it . 
  it gave room to compromise , to debate , to working together ... etc the islamist were no longer the evil horde who will oppress secularists . 
  and to the more conservative folks , the secularists were no longer evil dictators oppressing them . 
  they were just fellow citizens , who disagreed on some things and agreed on others . 
  this is why i myself think this kind of secularism is much better , especially for muslim countries , than laicite . 
   turkey shifted from more strict french secularism to anglo-american secularism i 'll get downvoted into oblivion . 
  but i think this is good . 
  i said just as much . 
  he does whatever he wants with full backing of moscow , under the pretext of squashing separatists and extremists . 
  the problem here is that kadyrovs ideas of what makes a '' separatist '' or '' extremist '' are very wide . 
  anyone against his brutal regime may be called a separatist . 
  people against him that harbor no extremist ideas are his enemies , liberals . 
  human rights activists ... etc this is exactly the problem that happened in iran , a brutal regime under the shah was backed by western countries and now we another brutal regime , that we condemn because of it 's totaliterianism . 
  but why did we not condemn the shah when his prisons were filled with leftists , socialists , communists , right-wing republicans ? 
  dictatorships and extremists feed on one another . 
  you should thank god that secularism is so closely associated with nationalism . 
  it would n't have caught on otherwise , not so strongly at least . 
  also though after 17 years of erdogan rule , opposition against him will only rise with the next generations , who lived all their lives under him . 
  thus they 'll turn to the anti-erdogan ideologies . 
  here mostly secularism . 
  still though , blindly following ataturk 's ideas is n't right either . 
  his ideas must also be adapted to the modern times . 
  it changed in the fact that it became more authoritarean . 
  but looking for specific islamic laws you would n't find many . 
  he allowed public servents to wear the hijab . 
  there are some conservative laws introduced , but i would n't call them islamic per se . 
  like the thing about not teaching evolution , it looks like a thing american conservatives would do . 
  islam itself has nothing against evolution . 
  anyway , erdogan sounds like a crazy nationalist nowadays , that should worry us more .

  it is not a good thing for states to compete so completely for labour -- because it reinforces the status quo . 
  the ones farthest behind , stay farthest behind because they lose the benefit of their most important resource : human capital . 
  labour immobility `` for our own good arguments '' are intellectually bankrupt , please refrain from them it 's not going to come off well . 
  we do n't try to keep people leaving the country anymore , like we used to in darker times . 
  a continental human capital market has helped us a lot more than a national one would . 
   insecurity of labour and suppression of wages also act to limit any real improvement in e.e. , because the more ` equal ' they become to germany , the less attractive they are as a host . 
   and the arrangement does n't benefit germany either . 
  the german car manufacturers moving their assembly or logistics chains to e.e. 
  deprive germany of jobs which would drive german demand . 
   insecurity of labour and suppression of wages also act to limit any real improvement in e.e. , because the more ` equal ' they become to germany , the less attractive they are as a host . 
  i think you 're missing a lot from what is being done in both germany and eastern europe to compete on the world stage . 
  for example , we are currently trying to integrate ourselves into the airbus logistic chain . 
  the more we integrate , the cheaper the products , the more orders we steal from boing , the more revenue we get , the higher our salaries , the more we buy , the higher the consumer demand from the east for other products . 
  repeat this over every sector . 
  if we did n't do this , then boing and other companies would have a near monopoly on the world market , leaving us buying from them and no industries of our own . 
   can you elabourate on what you mean by minimum differentiation as applied to the 4f ? 
  i 'm not seeing what you mean . 
  i 'm refering to the behaviour that leads to the minimum differentiation . 
  each actor tries to improve their own position incrementally , without taking account the end game . 
  if we remove labour movement to benefit the west . 
  then the east is left short and needs to do a counter move to assure employment . 
  so it starts putting tariffs , as it should , to protect nascent domestic industries like the asian tigers did . 
  they do this , and the west starts employing counter-tarriffs . 
  so and and so forth , until you get international blackmail like the plaza accords . 
  this is because no actor trust the other , and so try to get the most benefit from unilateral moves , to counter-act the consequences of the unilateral moves of others . 
  best to have pre-agreed standards and not allow defection to profit , and those agreed standards are the 4f . 
   and that 's because if everyone fucks you , you only expect to get fucked . 
   the real objective of the eu ought to be to make e.e. 
  and greece as productive and healthy as germany or other creditor states . 
  not to make any other state suffer as much as some states have . 
  you miss my point . 
  my point is that the greek economic difficulty is related to a poor administrative and political enviroment , one i 'm familiar with . 
  so i treat it as i do my own , with disdain and calls for reform . 
  this is not about wanting them to `` get fucked '' , this is about treating someone 's else 's problem as if it was mine . 
   we have achieved a situation in which intra-eu prosperity is a zero-sum game . 
  if you want to change it , redistribution must happen so that income moves in two directions instead of one . 
  otherwise , politics is like to overtake economics ( and not in a way good for the eu project ) in the next decade or two . 
  see , i do n't disagree with you here . 
  and in fact , i agree with a good deal of the intra-state redistribution arguments you made , and how state surpluses should be used to create continental prosperity . 
  it 's a good goal . 
  but i have two stances that are incompatible with everything else : 1 . 
  cross-continental supply chains are a good thing . 
  you try to compete with the us and china as a small country , and you 're going to get turned into mexico . 
  and we 're all small countries . 
  you can not put the fault of economic failure solely on eu/eurozone systems . 
  as we 've seen in venezuela and argentina , similar crises happen without them in place . 
  you have to give room that states are perfectly capable of driving themselves into the ground , without any help . 
  relevant question : why ? 
  who 's starting to suddenly buy goods ? 
  and porcupines only hurt when you step on them . 
  no invasion , no threat . 
  seems a good enough deal . 
   the model where all contribute to a common kitty to finance eu-wide goals fails when applied to the free movement ( s ) . 
  if a high number of bulgarians relocate to london , the uk does not receive any offset for social disruption or resource depletion as a result . 
  it does benefit -- mainly by the suppression of wages and supply of cheap labour . 
  but these would be arguably bad things , especially if you are from the uk and you 're competing against someone willing to work much cheaper . 
  the issue is not to take each element of the single market as having a net positive each and every time . 
  all elements put together , the four freedoms , are universally beneficial not the individual elements themselves . 
  the individual elements , freedom of movement , of goods , of investment etc , are there to balance each other out over every economy . 
   for that matter , what is the common good that the four freedoms provide ? 
  free movement of labour and capital mean growth and investment go in opposite directions : growth toward developed states and investment toward the undeveloped ones . 
   conversely , the growth achieved in developed states is also extractive -- over time the microeconomies become deflationary . 
  lower wages mean reduced purchasing power , and that reduces demand while the cost-savings is passed upward to shareholders rather than into the local community . 
   on the surface , that seems like a good thing , but it 's not . 
  the investments in those states are extractive ( not productive ) based on low wages and loose tax laws . 
  they are designed to benefit the host economy as little as possible so as to maximise return . 
  you 've just described the original eastern fear of joining the eu perfectly . 
  i wo n't go into it too much , since trying found out i wrote way to much , but on the money . 
  but what has happened , when it worked right instead of following the steps you outlined , is that western companies managed to keep more jobs than they lost . 
  this is because , by outsourcing portions of the supply chain to e.e , they preserved the portions of the supply chain in the west . 
  so instead of a car company going b \\ nkrupt , it exports seat production to poland , keeps everything else in france and still manages to keep up on the world market . 
  in e.e , on the other hand , instead of being turned into mexico where a permanently under-skilled and poor workforce becomes a drain on a low taxing state , that has to compete with other `` client states '' for outsourcing deals , the workforce can move where the jobs and money is , meaning : states feel less of a need to compete with each other , since a romanian worker can go work in a hungarian company . 
  and any extra workforce goes to work in the west , preventing a crippling welfare bill on a cash starved state . 
   a. i do n't buy a slippery slope argument . 
  we ca n't argue that rational behaviour creates a tragedy of the commons ( that states do what 's best for them to the detriment of the whole ) that the eu avoids while the eu is itself running a common monetary policy but not a common fiscal policy . 
  it 's not a slippery slope argument , look at hotelling 's law . 
  it 's part of the inherent ineficiencies in a competitive market without regulatory framework to establish an optimum outcome . 
  this applies just as well to the political decision making surrounding labour and employment . 
  and `` common monetary policy '' / `` common fiscal policy '' argument comes off as a non-sequitor , and i 've come to disagree immensely with it . 
  the power of currency devaluation to undermine wages is overstated , trust me , i had to live through them and will continue to do so as the government is heading for a hard budgetary deficit because of such moves . 
   specifically , the lack of a fuller integration ( or a greater independence ) means that the common monetary policy benefits some and harms others . 
  germany 's surplus is greece 's deficit so to speak , while a ` federal ' system would make that a moot point . 
  this is a more complicated and nuanced topic than presented . 
  while surplus/deficit relationships are true , trade in goods is n't the only way wealth moves around . 
  there are other ways to increase capital flows between countries , that have nothing to do with export , like a tourist economy , and so surpluses and deficits should n't be seen as been symmetrically linked . 
  and , honestly , greece did a lot of their problems to themselves . 
  romania also got money from the imf and esm , we did the austerity reforms , and we did n't grumble much . 
  why ? 
  because we 're used to it , we 're used to fucking up and we know what to expect when you ask money from the imf . 
  it has nothing to do with `` fiscal integration '' and everything to do with : if you 're asking money from the imf you 're going to have a bad neoliberal time . 
  honestly , i think you should give more thought to the greek issue , taking in mind a more eastern european perspective of trying to equalize with the west . 
  to us , greece 's position is familiar territory and we do n't consider it an inherent eu problem , despite a wider anglo-media narrative to suggest otherwise . 
  cheers . 
  really envying the quality of the polish shorts , keep them up . 
  the grodzka/nowogrodzka joke flew over my head , can someone clue me in ? 
  why do n't you extend that to every mayor-ship and council , and reinstitute relocation permits ? 
  why does london have to pay for cardiff ? 
  why does the rest of germany subsidize berlin ? 
  the wider social contract trumps the lower ones , and that wider one for us is the eu . 
  everyone has an area of the single market they 're not hot on .

  are you being sarcastic and i 'm not getting it ? 
   oh well . . tyranny works better for muslim countries than democracy anyway how do you figure that ? 
  there 's a reason why turkey was a pretty sane country until recently and it sure is n't because it 's becoming a dictatorship . 
  but like a user pointed out , every time he appoints someone `` provisionally '' they always end up `` winning '' . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4vaht6/putin_makes_his_bodyguard_the_governor_of_the/d5x1gap it seems like putin has simply found a way to uphold an illusion of democracy while gaming the system every chance . 
  the guy is completely irrelevant now though so yeah , he 's advocating for it much like the populists in the west to cater to racists and idiots . 
   2nd : those money were never came to greece or actually just 8 % of them came to greece . 
  the rest of your money that you so fiercy asking back from `` me '' gone to german and french banks mosty ( and ofc to other eu banks too ) . 
  why ? 
  ask your leadership for that answer . 
  you seem to think not paying the banks would be ok . 
  it would 've caused a huge problem for the entire eu including you guys . 
  debt is part of government spending , so the fact that a lot of the loans went to paying debt is not really saying much . 
  every country does argue the same , the rates differ based on how old the population is though . 
  you 're like clayton bigsby i swear . 
  `` hurr durr i 'm syrian but trust me every other syrian is a dumb cunt '' . 
  nobody has indoctrinated me about the west being colonists , that much is obvious for anyone that has studied history and knows how the colonial powers acted . 
   you teach them critical thinking when they are older quit older , by that time ideas that they picked up while young will be very difficult to remove , hence when you try to think critically of islam shit hit the fan you teach kids critical thinking skills since they are young you moron , you do n't indoctrinate them into islam and then try to teach them to be critical of it when they 're older . 
  seriously where do you even get this shit from ? 
  education in the west is better because it focuses on rational thinking and science ( critical thinking ) , not religious indoctrination . 
  you sound mentally deficient i swear , your whole post is one long shitty uninformed diatribe arguing about how the young need to be severely indoctrinated despite any sane rational person knowing why that is unhealthy and why it creates drones like you . 
  then you go on to claim that the creation of israel in the middle of palestinian territory was a-ok just because 6 million of them were killed in europe a few years before , so it 's pretty fucking rich to see you claim arab anti-semitism being the problem , instead of recognizing that would 've never happened if some people did n't decide to genocide the jews in europe . 
  still , what more can i expect from someone that is obviously describing themselves when they talk about the need to indoctrinate children instead of teaching them critical thinking skills . 
  obviously you know best since you 've managed to turn historical fact ( like the occupations , redrawal of maps , coups , invasion ) into identity politics . 
  how ignorant must you be to think those things have not shaped the middle east into what it is today ? 
  very few people are like that comical caricature you 're trying to paint in order to dismiss everyone that does n't share your opinion . 
  most people realize that inevitably the refugee crisis will be used by bad people as well , but upholding human values and laws is more important by helping the very many real refugees . 
  most of them come from failed states and warzones such as syria , iraq , afghanistan , or theocratic regimes like iran . 
  that 's not true , lots of countries have been taking refugees in . 
  yeah , that 's not extreme at all . 
  nobody is implying that , but it 's clear most refugees are in fact refugees . 
  the top 5 countries by origin are failed states and warzones . 
  like the other user said , you only have two choices , either you exclude everyone or you let some in that should n't be allowed . 
  what 's surprising is that many people are harping on about european values while they want to ignore basic human rights when it comes to refuges because they ca n't stomach the fact that some bad people are going to inevitably get in as well . 
   they lack the sense of critical thinking so it has to be indoctrination wow . 
  that 's why you teach them critical thinking skills instead of indoctrinating them . 
  quality of education matters a lot and it 's a big reason why europe is n't still hugely under the churches influence like it used to be . 
  what do you think secularization means ? 
  where do you think it came from ? 
  education and democracy played a huge role in the secularization of europe . 
  the church used to be hugely influential and many bad things have been carried out over the centuries in the name of religion . 
  just because we 're more secular now and do n't have that many fundamentalists anymore does n't mean we 're special and unique superior beings , it just means context has been much more favorable for most of us born today throughout europe . 
  when will people realize that the middle east has never really been let to go through those same processes over the last century , it 's been under occupation , carved up , controlled for oil , had democratic regimes removed through coups to serve british oil interests and was invaded by the us in a totally imprudent and stupid manner pretty god damned recently . 
  oh and i forgot about israel being planted right in the middle because we wanted to give the jews a little something . 
  what changed is war in the middle east . 
  it has spread like a virus . 
  we can all thank the rash and stupid actions of the usa after 9/11 for that . 
  i 'm really hoping people wo n't make that mistake again , but it seems very likely that soon people will want blood and fuck everything up again . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  there 's valid reasons why 5 % unemployment is good and why it 's bad to have bellow that and it has nothing to do with people ca n't finding jobs to work . 
  that number is mostly made out of people looking for new jobs , students out of college and the structure of the economy changing slightly . 
  anything bellow that means you probably have a problem . 
   but only 65 % of the population works that 's a terrible way to judge things by , there 's plenty of valid reasons why 35 % of the population does n't work . 
  it 's mostly composed of kids , students , stay-at-home mums , disabled and old people . 
  jesus you 're dense . 
  no , that 's not the logic , the point is that you need to keep things in perspective . 
  these attacks are very sensational in nature , even more so than plane crashes , but statistically they are almost insignificant . 
  nothing is `` exactly the same '' , but violence is part of human nature , and these attacks while horrible are a part of that . 
  they barely make a dent in preventable causes of death statistics , yet you 're acting like germany as we know it is coming to an end . 
  bitch please , do you really think a few dozen deaths a year will make the country crumble ? 
  100 times as many die in card accidents every year in germany or the uk alone . 
  i 'm pointing out what the actual reason behind your outrage is . 
  everybody knows i 'm right anyway . 
  that 's not necessarily true . 
  for example in transylvania unemployment is extremely low and salaries are what you 'd expect for very low skilled positions ( a bit above minimum wage ) and with a need for workers , while in other regions unemployment is high but the people there refuse to move here in order to work , because `` why should i move and work for minimum wage '' , they 'd rather just be on welfare . 
  i mean you can say whatever you want , but if your village is poor as fuck and there are no jobs and you do n't have any skills or a degree , then working a bit above minimum wage is pretty much what you can expect , if you 'd rather stay on welfare , the problem might be with you , sorry . 
  welfare is for those that ca n't work , it 's not for those that do n't want to work because minimum wage is too small . 
  most people wo n't , and some attacks are definitely motivated by the infamy . 
  the name and picture add absolutely nothing to the conversation . 
  some people are mad because how in the world will people now connect terrorism to muslims , which is ridiculous , because if anything people will just assume it was a muslim every time much like they did until now anyway . 
  not to mention the fact that it is proven that media attention concentrating on attackers does encourage others to act . 
  we should concentrate on discussing the subject matter and the victims , not make the attackers famous . 
  i think it 's a good move and i really do n't see the downsides others are claiming . 
  you 're only getting so mad because `` oh my god how will people know it 's a muslim '' . 
  great , another victim of populism . 
  the pure common people against the evil elite . 
  it 's not the same you 're right , the media absolutely loves to drool all over the former , while the latter is reserved for a small column in the local newspaper `` man axes his wife because she did n't make dinner '' . 
  treason is intentionally hurting your own country , which is a very big accusation . 
  unless you can actually prove that any of them have intentionally done it in order to undermine , betray and hurt the usa , then all you are doing is punishing people for political decisions . 
  well , it 's not exactly the same . 
  things are a bit more under control here , nobody is undermining the constitutional court , which is one of the first signs of democracy being dismantled . 
  why does that matter so much ? 
  the us has a much smaller population than europe , proportionally it 's the same number . 
  this fearmongering is getting ridiculous . 
  you 'd think europe is in danger of being occupied or something judging by the alarmists in this topic . 
  most muslims absolutely are peaceful and are not terrorists , the enemy is n't this 5 million you flaunt , the enemy is composed of maybe a few thousand people . 
  the only real threat is ourselves , if we give in to all this fearmongering . 
  that 's not exactly true , the aim of terrorism is political and economic destabilization , by creating fear you elicit an irrational response that can be very damaging . 
  if people elect nutjobs , it is inevitable that europe will destabilize , leaving it weaker and more exposed . 
  that is ultimately the goal of terrorism , it just requires our `` active '' participation for them to achieve it . 
  unfortunately there are very many people willing to participate , it 's the type of people that have bough into this apocalyptic narrative of everything collapsing and going to shit , fear is their aim and more and more people are affected by it . 
  fearful people tend to make irrational decisions and fear can be exploited by populists and demagogues . 
  i mean , let 's face it , most people today would probably say they are very scared of terrorism and viewed it as a big problem , even though statistically the chances of being involved in such an attack are extremely small . 
   a straw man argument is `` an intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent 's real argumen yeah , which is exactly what you did . 
  you 're trying to discredit people with opposing views by creating a strawman with outrageous views that do n't represent reality . 
  now you 're playing coy by saying you did n't engage in a dialog . 
  well , what are you doing posting in the comments section then ? 
  this is a dialogue , it 's a god damn forum of people sharing ideas and thoughts . 
  you 're making up caricatures in order to make your point , that 's the problem . 
  yeah , i bet crime * never * happens wherever you 're from .

  very interesting, 
  hence what just happened in australia where peopld got hep a from eating blueberries imported from china which had trace of human faeces, 
  the price is a huge issue . 
  but when i said bad courses i was n't referring to the famous colleges but the for-profit colleges . 
  many of them are complete rip offs and are more expensive . 
  we must not let this happen . 
  education should be available to all not like america where many people do n't even have a chance to have a decent education and where private colleges rip people off with huge prices and bad courses . 
  yeap big question right there . 
  can assume either looking for low skilled work or the welfare gravy train . 
  and that 's a worry . 
  if they do n't speak english that 's a massive alarm bell . 
  this indicates either people looking for unskilled work or welfare . 
  so def agree that must stop . 
  now that auckland oakland shit is funny !, 
  haha how the hell ? 
  where was he coming from ? 
  sure have . 
  i went to school there until 11th grade then i finished high school in a developed western country . 
  needless to say my level was way above anyone else . 
  i literally topped every subject including english and got a scholarship which paid for my uni degree because of it . 
  in romania i was towards the bottom of a class but at a good high school . 
  when it comes to free thinking i agree communism was not very conducive . 
  but in the area of exact sciences it did do very well . 
  i agree a lot of the teachers in romania were weird idiots while my western teachers were amazing cool people . 
  but the differences in the curriculum and their knowledge were huge . 
  that being said i know its all going downhill now . 
  yes it does , it has everything to do with what came before . 
  saying that today 's programmers are a result of piracy and internet access is ridiculous and pretty dumb . 
  the internet helped a lot but who do you think taught the first generation of programmers back in the 1990s ? 
  also my father is an it engineer as well . 
  back in the 80s he went to china to install romanian computers and teach the chinese ( how silly does that sound ) . 
  his best friend left straight after 1989 and now is a respected it teacher at atexas university . 
  there are loads of highly respected programmers that left romania in the early 1990s well before the advent of internet and piracy . 
  there were lots if fucktards for sure but there were also a lot of brilliant minds that laid the foundations of what we have today . 
  well i would say on the exact science part it definetly produced a ton of good engineers , mathematicians , statisticians etc. 
  why do you think we have the highest number of it people per capita in europe ? 
  because ever since the 1950s the commies established a long tradition of calculation centres all over the country . 
  when it comes to the exact sciences education nowadays pales in comparison to what it used to be . 
  communism had a lot of evils but its stupid denying some of the positive things that were done . 
  dont know about bulgaria but for romania communism had a very positive impact on education . 
  before communism the country was an agragrian society with about 40 % of people being illiterate . 
  by 1960 the literacy rate was increased to almost 90 % . 
  so putting that into perspective communism had a very positive impact on education despite all its other evils . 
  no wonder they sued him that is ridiculous, 
  what does medieval ppl even mean ? 
  guy sounds like a troll, 
  yeah i guess i was making a generalisation . 
  but i was surprised to hear that the uk and aus are facing the same issues seeing as they have the common heritage . 
  the issues in aus are compounded by the heavy use of steroids and drugs among youth which is a dangerous cocktail . 
  everything is too expensive there if you are referring to australia, 
  no offense but this must be some sort of anglo thing . 
  australia is exactly the same . 
  looking back at my younger days going out in sydney there was never a night without a brawl or a bashing . 
  its getting so bad that clubs are now locking out at 1 am . 
  there have been many deaths of young 18 yr old people being literally king hit in the face in clubs . 
  its a huge worry . 
  the gagauz are very pro-russian . 
  in fact they had a moscow backed referendum last year against closer eu ties http://www.dw.de/moldovas-gagauz-region-leans-toward-moscow/a-17504239 it 's stupid they are like that seeing the russian treatment of the tatars in crimea . 
  meanwhile romania has a thriving turkish community . 
  it is not so simple . 
  moldova has been subjected to 200 years of russification and colonisation . 
  the rural population in moldova is quite pro-russian as seen in the latest election result when the commies got the highest result . 
  the country is deeply divided between the pro-west urban and youth population and the pro-russians . 
  plus there are minority groups like the gagauz which are thoroughly against a union . 
  maybe in a generation when the soviet nostalgics will be gone and the russian influence has been countered . 
  the best we can do atm is get moldova closer to the eu , continue helping them and doing joint projects , get as many moldovans with scolarships in romania etc. 
  thats really good . 
  but i 'm sure we also have the dirtiest air in europe in places like baia mare . 
  i love my fellow moldovans but you may be right , it is a very small country and it is not vary varied geographically . 
  there are a few cool medieval castles . 
  plus cheap as . 
  romania has been a western wannabe ever since the 19th century . 
  back then france was a beacon of civilization so all our intellectuals studied there and modelled a lot of our modern system on france . 
  ever since then we always looked up to france , england and germany . 
  now add the us to it and thats pretty much it . 
  so did russians . 
  there were russian ss divisions , and muslim ones and pretty much every nation in europe . 
  my bad, 
  nahh not yelling . 
  just reinforcing your point of how messed up british media is . 
  dude have u seen tge bbc so called doco the romanians are coming ? 
  they literally pick the poorest , dirtiest immigrants from the poorest , dirtiest de industrialised city in romania . 
  then they male a doccumentary about them . 
  really ? 
  i live in australia and i can take you to plenty of shit hole places that look like crap and where you will lilely get stabbed at night . 
  does that represent australia , a coubtry that is number in hdi ? 
  and how does that have anything to do with this thread ? 
  or with romania for that matter ? 
  yet again we were the scapegoats, 
  well apparently having an honest oppinion is now racist . 
  i wouldnt want to go to china to find out that the local noodle place run by italians . 
  so i agree with your position fully . 
  that is a silly excuse . 
  the soviet union was a continuation of the tsarist empire and was russian through and through . 
  all those georgians , ukrainias etc were fully russified . 
  that shit is scary man . 
  at this rate there will literally be no more young doctors left in romania . 
  what happens when the old ones die out and there are no new ones to replace them ? 
  ive encountered this in australia . 
  why is it rascist to display the flag ?

oh , really ? 
  i thought supercor is as big of a thing as caprabo ... well , til, 
  i do n't know . 
  i live in barcelona , near a supercor that is opened on everyday untill 2 am . 
  maybe i 'm just lucky , but i always thought `` if there is one near me , there must be also in other parts of the city '' . 
  i guess not so much then . 
  ceta is a free trade agreement between eu and canada . 
  i do n't really know much details about it and why some might be against it . 
  what i can tell you is that romania is not against ceta itself , but uses it as an opportunity to have an upper hand at negotiating visa removal for romanians . 
   will asylum seekers impregnate your pension ? 
  well , this still sounds a bit weird ... 
  well , that 's true . 
  but italy and sweden/norway are exist more because of the mountain ranges rather that rivers . 
  it is cool to see it on this map , but for me more interesting seems poland , or the 3 regions of czechia ( from gsv_little_rascal 's original comment ) :  interesting how three czech basins closely match 3 historical  regions ( bohemia - labe , moravia - dunabe , silesia - oder ) . 
  yeah , and ... ? 
  they are all quite different ethnically and culturally . 
  it dose n't mean anything that they share the same basin . 
  a more interesting overlap would be the fact that old eastern germany seems to have one basin , or that the 3 historical regions in chekia seem to overlap the 3 basins , as someone else mentioned somwhere around here . 
  question : what is `` rou '' ? 
  where is it used ? 
  is it short for romania in usa ? 
  or in english ? 
  i ask because i do n't remember ever seeing it , usually `` ro '' represents romania ... like in cars , and internet and ... things like that . 
  what does the interesting part mean ? 
  i do n't understand anything . 
  i am quite new in the chaotic art of nowadays economics and it 's quite hard for me to comprehend things sometimes . 
  well , if russia was to go to war with nato do n't you think it will drag with it all the other countries that are under russian influence / support russia/are russia aligned ( however do you want to call it ) ? 
  that would make enough part of the world distracted by war for china to barge in and try to profit ( e.g. 
  usa is occupied with russia so then it can not protect/help some weaker allies in the south china sea ... ) and that would drag most of the rest of the world with it , effectively making it world war 3 . 
  i do n't see any ... maybe albania ? 
  edit : and iraq , maybe ? 
  that area was quite obviously influenced by the tigris and euphrates rivers . 
  but other than that i do n't actually see any cultural/ethnic overlaps . 
  i understand and i agree, 
   at that point they did n't know he produced explosives they just send several guys with 30 kg armor to surround the house for a routine ... uhh ... house chek . 
  i forgot the word . 
  anyways , i do agree with you on the most parts , but you ca n't say that they did n't expect to be explosives involved . 
  they answered to an anti-terrorist call , did n't they ? 
  ehhh ... 
  there is some sentiment towards it , but i do n't believe it will be happening in the next 10 years . 
  why is the batman province with unknown origin ? 
  maybe there is no consensus but batman is ( was ) a thing in turkey that is not the bat-costumed man : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/batman_ ( unit ), 
  you got any subtitles ? 
  i understand your point and concerns . 
  but i believe that the bar example is not so bad . 
  when going to a site that streams videos it is equally hard to find out if the videos are legally on that site as it is to see if the videos in a bar are legally there . 
  of course torrenting and similar things where it is quite obvious that you get an illegal copy is out of the question ( and out of the scope of this thread ) . 
  the idea is that the one who is giving the content should be the bad guy , not the viewers . 
  i think that this is possibly because the viewers might not know they watch illegal copies . 
  like , what if some site gives some old royalty free cartoon to watch from free , and make revenue from ads and a very similar site gives old movies , that are not royalty free and they are pirated ? 
  and maybe some other site similar to the last one that managed to have such a good monetization method that it can give some movies to stream legitly . 
  how can a user differentiate ? 
  like the example above : if you go into a bar that streams illegal content are you legible for watching it ? 
  tl ; dr : it 's not legalizing pirating just moving the blame from the watcher to the streamer . 
  soo ... you mean that , politically , countries not in eu are not european . 
  then , what continent switzerland belongs to , politically ? 
  * affected . 
  i 'm not usually correcting spelling errors , just that affect and effect are 2 different things  edit : my bad , til that effect can be used to describe something that was caused  example : the new manager effected some positive changes in the office . 
  ( this means that the new manager caused some positive changes to take place in the office . ), 
  i do n't think norway , switzerland and iceland are sitting in the queue . 
  that makes sense . 
  well , let me just rephrase that : if you manage to have the same ( or higher ) gdp with fewer people , then it is still good . 
  edit : i understand that could still happen when only unemployed people would leave , but that 's beyond unrealistic . 
  well , if you manage to do the same thing with less people , it 's still good, 
  i think this might be of help here : [ list of european countries by average wage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) . 
  i would be curious if anyone has any information about the [ median ] ( https://www.vocabulary.com/articles/chooseyourwords/mean-median-average/ ) wage , cause it helps understand better how many people are actually poor . 
  i think because they should be independent first . 
  like , declare independence from kosovo , then , they can decide to join serbia if they wish . 
  if they push for joining serbia before being independent ( being helped by serbia ) it can be seen that serbia wants to annex the region . 
  you know , like a conquest . 
  which is illegal internationally , for obvious reasons . 
  i understand that a region should have the right to join another country directly if they want to , but the line where they want to , or the other country wants to may be a bit blurred , so i guess that 's why getting independence first is needed . 
  something like a fail-safe . 
  yeah , that * can * be skewed by other countries also , yes , but still . 
  this is the best description of the current problems with articles and journals that i have ever heard !, 
  ( although a bit eccentric ), 
  hmmm , yeah ... 
  i guess i never actually realised how big that stretch of land between the carpats and the urals is ... 
  are the ural mountains really that far , or is it just an optical illusion ? 
  i mean , i know they are not close , but comparing that with other reference points closer in europe it seems a bit too far , like , far beyond caspian sea . 
  well , that is a good point indeed . 
  india was a colony of uk . 
  was the status of korea as vassal of china similar to being a colony ? 
  if so , then yeah , ok , you could say that korea was part of the chinese empire . 
  i suspect that the status of vassal state and colony may be different , but i do not know enough on the matter ( at this time ) to say for sure . 
  but good point , nevertheless . 
  yet research is actual `` research '' not several experiences had by one or two people . 
  although i agree that this study does not take into account the expenses , which might hinder how equitable the healthcare system actually is . 
  but yeah , it is still research . 
  well , bucharest was called `` little paris '' by the people living there , in the interwar period , and many architectural designs and a lot of culture was inspired by paris and france . 
  yet , i do n't think you would say bucharest was french . 
  point is , culturally , maybe koreans wanted to be at the same level , or even the same as the chinese . 
  but korea was not a province of china . 
  well ... do n't big companies have r&d departments ? 
  research and development ? 
  a * lot * of companies do research in their own field in order to be better than the competition . 
  look at vehicles , for example . 
  i would think that the bulk of research done to create electric cars is done by companies . 
  the same with autonomous cars . 
  google , uber , tesla the big shots in this emerging field are all big companies .

   tea is the way you heathens !, 
  have i found my lost brother from birth ? 
  i always found it amusing how obssessed the western world has been lately with foreign , exotic people , both men and woman . 
  it really reflects itself with social phenomenons like yellow fever , or mail-order brides for former-su women . 
  are genuinely conservative people really endangered in the west ? 
  because that 's what i see that both men and woman are looking for in foreign partners . 
  was it because the territory was fully russian ? 
  wait , what territories did the baltic states lose because of russia ? 
  ouch , labelling hungary as slavic . 
  pretty sure they 'd rather be classified as balkan instead . 
  lots of anti-eu comments i noticed in this article , but the trend seems to portray western europe as abusing the poorer , desperate eastern europeans for their own benefit . 
  really makes me wonder how refugees and illegal immigrant from outside the eu fare in comparison . 
  i thought rapunzel was a german fairytale . 
  how can you know if they 're tartars just from the images ? 
  indeed it does , so calling china multi-ethnic in a quantifiable meaningful way is useless . 
  apart from ethnicity that is mostly cultural , 70 % of its population is a native mandarin speaker , with pretty much all of the rest speaking it as a second language . 
  religiously they are also very homogenous , with 73 % unaffiliated or adhering to traditional chinese religions like confuciansim or taoism . 
  15 % are also buddhist , which is also a familiar regional ideology . 
  lastly immigration is not even a concern when you consider their massive population . 
   tbh i think the problems caused by climate change may end up being bigger ... and they 'll hit us as well . 
  this . 
  there are already problems with famines in africa , south sudan being the most recent one . 
  droughts , desertification , extreme weather , etc will slowly drain the continent dry if foreign intervention is not swift enough . 
  progressive by near east standards i should meant . 
  tunisia being progressive is surprising . 
  afaik the majority of women celebrate by receiving flowers , chocolate and spending time with their close ones . 
  political activism is not something most women , or people in general , bother with . 
  if swedish law overlooks the minority bias and judge refugees for racism , hate-speech , etc they probably would not get deported , as it constitutes a trifle crime . 
  what is it like living there ? 
  can confirm , we do this in romania too . 
  it seems to be a general eastern european custom . 
  the november bolshevik coup does n't have the same ring to it , sadly, 
  right sr it seems . 
  not just any book , hundreds of millions are emotionally invested in it , some more fanatically than others . 
  the anti-polish sentiment is surprisingly old for germany . 
  at the very least for prussia it existed since frederick the great who was very contemptuous towards them . 
  is n't political circlejerking the natural state of / r/europe ? 
  you 're not alone , i learned how to pronounce it from physics class . 
  what 's wrong with you turkey ?!, 
  not that we are doing much better . 
  any data about it ? 
  too bad our salaries are so miserable that significant numbers of people struggle to put food on the plate daily . 
  - some of the earliest slavs settled around the area after samo 's empire fell in the form of carinthia . 
  - their language is distinct from the serbo-croatian dominant area alongside with macedonian . 
  - their nation is often confused with slovakia . 
  the similar names have something to do with their legacy as the purest of slavic nations i believe . 
  that 's why you take the diplomatic idea for faster envoy travel !, 
  china would own most of asia , africa and america by the end of the decade . 
  in hindsight , it probably would 've been better if ataturk kept his power knowing how turkey would end up decades later . 
  i assume the german empire & prussia , since that 's around when the german identity started taking off . 
  the hre might be too antiquated and obscure while post-wwi germany and hitler are things they might want to stay away from to uphold their image . 
  he has the best words too . 
  casanova ai n't got nothing on his flirting . 
  how dare they disrespect chad and their national identity . 
  assuming that nation states have n't collapsed into anarachy and tribalism yet . 
  so much optimism . 
  yet more and more imperialistic , islamic , intolerant values seem to be taking hold in a nation whose founding father had contradicting ideals . 
  japan always delivers ... 
  i assume the peninsula is more conservative then ? 
  especially when olaf takes all the good women ... 
  where are all the redheads at is what i wan na know . 
  so it has come to the point where game developers have to defend their artistic expression because it does n't fit a particular political agenda ? 
  as donald trump would say : sad !, 
  you 'll be needing some moldovan lessons first !, 
  not everyone , afaik serbia and romania have had good relations for many decades . 
  if we 'll have a post-scarcity world communism would most likely be the best solution . 
  when 99 % of the world will be unemployed an universal income and equal distribution of resources is a no-brainer . 
  the few german tourists i 've met in transylvania were very polite and compliant . 
  to each their own i guess . 
  their huge territory , big population and nuclear arsenal wo n't be going away anytime soon . 
  as long as russia still has these basic three things , it can still be relevant and catch up . 
  it really makes me wonder if things would 've been better if all the former block countries formed an organization to manage their affairs better , sort of like v4 . 
  why is that particular part of the country popular with tourists ? 
  ca n't believe there 's no dig towards the ( former ? ), 
  german minority living in the south of the peninsula, 
  i like how they put prussia on the map . 
  y' know , just for bonus far-right points . 
  never change ` murica . 
  you 'd think lativans would hate germans for their baltic crusades . 
  i was gon na reply that the statistic seems rather dodgy to me , but you got me covered . 
  muslims from other countries , especially se asia , are radically different from migrants and refugees . 
  not even european muslims ( tatars , albanians , bosnians ) compare to the ones we 're importing . 
  are the other maghreb countries just as bad or is it a specific thing ? 
  i genuinely do n't know much about them . 
  wait , how is hungary last ? 
  i thought german education was pretty strong over there . 
  this kind of irredentism fueled by ethno-nationalism is no longer deemed acceptable in the contemporary world . 
  everyone has a beef with someone else over righteous claims , and simply accepting some of them would set a dangerous precedent that it 's an acceptable action which would destabilize many countries . 
  realistically , borders can not be set in stone , but it 's in everyone 's interest to pretend they are simply for the sake of stability and diplomatic relations . 
  it 's not about how strong is the claim , but how strong is the country on the global stage and their political will . 
  romania has a pretty strong reason to incorporate moldova , but tensions with russia through transnistria and the effort required do n't allow it . 
  you want to sanction the third largest producer of gold in africa and one of the poorest country in the world over some migrants ? 
  that 's not a wise move , especially when you consider that it has pretty much no industry or service sector , and is heavily tied with france due to its past . 
  eu wide sanctions would pretty much destroy this country while removing cheap goods from europe 's market . 
  someone failed at geography ... 
  when will they solve the nagorno-karabakh debacle ? 
  will they respect azerbaijan 's sovereignty or the ethnic armenian 's rights ? 
  that 's what you get for historically using the area as an inhuman priso-i mean internal exile . 
  but in all seriousness , it 's amazing how places like novosibirsk , omsk managed to sprout and flourish despite all the criminal background and minority issues . 
  although it 's still not as a successful story as australia .

  lol , no . 
  center is ukraine who [ moments before this shot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taxkgtoxdue ) was taken `` attacked '' usa and russia and then proceeded to kill herself . 
  from my point of view the `` purpose '' of this is to hammer down the idea that ukraine is unilaterally at fault here , that ukraine is the aggressor and they attacked russia . 
  here 's the original video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taxkgtoxdue, 
  ahahahahaha , wait wait , fuck , lol . 
  a regular t_d user posts russian fucking propaganda on / r/europe ?? 
  what the fuck is this ? 
  that 's interesting !, 
  do you know more info about that ? 
  what was the reason of the war ? 
  pardon , i was arguing against the reasons you got the downvotes and how you proceeded to edit the comment and come off as upset yourself . 
  that 's just ridiculous considering that you know that `` most people around here are clearly pro-eu which do not support brexit '' . 
  could be that people simply disagreed with your points ? 
  could it be that people downvoted on behalf of their dislike for peter hitchens ? 
  why are you so emotional about it ? 
   but it is naturally eurosceptic cut the crap , mate . 
  there 's nothing `` natural '' about uk 's eurosceptism , it is not only propped up but inflated by propagandist british `` media '' and their lies , if that 's natural then botox and penis pumps are natural as well . 
   look how upset you folks get when that point is even mentioned . 
  i didnt claim anything was good or bad i didnt call anyone out and yet you feel compelled to deny the claim like its poison , fuck you . 
  mmmmm , that 's a lot of projecting you have there . 
  why do you think that the people downvoting you were upset ? 
   i 'm truggered that triggered me . 
  where are the anglos !?!, 
   now that would be pretty hard to one up . 
  hmmm , how about no impeachment , but instead you get 4 years of a president with an obvious mental illness ? 
  his only widely praised actions so far ( domestically and internationally ) have been missiles launched at syria and bombs dropped in afghanistan . 
  it wo n't take long until he learns that his only route to praise without criticism is stirring up military action . 
  with 3 and 1/2 years to go , he could definitely come up with grounds to invade iran , north korea , etc. 
  we no longer live in a world where the apocalyptic could never happen , so it 's very possible a confrontation in the east china sea or something could spin out of his control because he 's so arrogant and incompetent . 
  oh yeah , you 're right on that part and it 's not what i actually meant , excuse my poor choice of word . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the states will not only continue their attacks in the middle east , but escalate it to a new level . 
  iran will most likely be destabilized and new military attacks will be made on whatever grounds they come up with , any aggressive action that comes from nk , no matter how small , will have a high chance to be met with another invasion/war . 
  when i said `` well if they do not do anything downright idiotic , like an act of war or something equally stupid '' i meant an act of war on a country that they ca n't justify just as easily as they would the ones in middle east or nk . 
  otherwise proper propaganda can explain away any attacks they do in iran or other such countries . 
  i mean , look , the number of drone strikes has *** quadrupled *** under trump , the same drone strikes that obama was barraged for , and no one really bats an eye . 
   i think the most likely case is that his spectacular failure will lead to a renewed push for a strong democratic system worldwide , but there is a very real chance that we are facing the twilight of the postwar system of wealthy powerful democracies integrating and liberalizing the world and into a system of european democracies squabbling internally while the rest of the world descends into illiberal states a la putin 's russia . 
  eh , while i get what you 're saying , that 's a too-pessimistic of a view for me . 
  i find it more likely that left-progressive ideas to be further propagated , if you look at the bigger picture the world as a whole continues to move towards that , sure it 's not a direct path , but a trend . 
  well if they do not do anything downright idiotic , like an act of war or something equally stupid , i do n't think their international image will suffer *** that *** much - sure , it gets papercut after papercut worth of damage and death by a thousand papercuts is a possibility , but that takes time . 
  to me it feels that there 's no more space for american politics to move to the `` right '' ( from an european point of view , this would be the `` extreme right '' ) without heavy damage to the republicans , but a shitload of space to move to the left . 
  however , you know , never say never and all that , shit can still happen . 
  eh , we will see , i guess !, 
  from my point of view , even though i know it hurts the us in the short term , in the long term someone like trump is good for them specifically because he 's so bad , the more he fucks shit up the bigger the blow back will be and the faster the states will recuperate . 
  sure , that 's pure speculation , but it might work . 
  i hope that everything trump wants gets approved - climate cuts , education cuts , healthcare `` reform '' , tax cuts on the rich , extra-inflated military attack budget ( not really a `` defense '' budget , let 's be honest , usa is not really defending itself from any attack ) , religious bullshit laws or whatever the fuck . 
  the fucking wall too , especially that bottomless money-eating pit of a `` project '' . 
  at least if you wan na fuck up , fuck up big time , learn your lesson and move the fuck on . 
  yup , i have zero hopes for labour to pull a coalition , just like i had zero hopes for labour to do any good in the election , i actually expected a landslide tory victory . 
  literally anything that happens is a pleasant surprise and drama-rich , as expected from the lovely brits . 
  [ mommie dearest really fucked shit up big time .

   smidir\u00edn\u00ed you guys need to bring gaeilge back , it 's such a wonderful language . 
   a bit like what the tories did with their majority . 
  i 've been laughing at last night memes ever since i woke up . 
  brits are so good at media-drama . 
  i 'll be laughing the rest of the year if labour manages to make a coalition with the rest of them . 
   smithereens is basically english non-formal for small pieces/ribbons/shreds . 
  that makes sense !, 
  thank you , til !, 
   but the questing * remains , how is america going to one up us on this ? 
  hmmm , would a constitutional crisis or a impeachment scandal work ? 
  or perhaps there 's gon na be another huge leak that blows everything to smithereens . 
  * ^ ( talking of which , what the fuck are `` smithereens '' ? 
  i know what the expression means , but i just realized i never knew what that particular word means or where it comes from ) *, 
  shhh , do n't anger the germans , you know how they get when they 're [ angry ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mzdghnm.png ) . 
  the polls have been all over the place in the past few days , it 's crazy , lol . 
  anyway , my default position is a tory win , basically same ol' same ol ( relatively ) , no disappointment involved , life goes on . 
   remember , it 's a series of electoral regions voting rather than a popular vote . 
  yep , i have to keep reminding myself of that from time to time . 
  however , i think the recent labour gains , however small , could be construed as a positive for britain - a stronger opposition does well to keep the ones in power in check ( something that we currently lack , for example ), 
  considering relatively recent political events , my default position on this is `` may will win '' , that way i ca n't get disappointed and any other result is a pleasant surprise !, 
  i 've seen brits taking a similar position as well . 
  * ^ ( after you 've been burned by hot soup you blow in your yogurt . 
  yes , that 's what i meant - for those crimes . 
  however , that right to trial , kinda goes out the window when you 're on the battlefield , and i think that it 's in france 's interest to kill its enemies , in this case french officials using iraqi soldiers to kill isis soldiers . 
  playing dumb , i see . 
  but you do it so well , that i 'm actually believing you . 
  were n't you guys spazzing out that you were leaving reddit ? 
  what happened ? 
  why did you came crying back ? 
  absolutely fucking not . 
  they have chosen themselves to be an active part of isis , to be part of that war and you want to let them go about , do their killings and catch them when they come back , if they come back ? 
  are you off your meds , mate ? 
  it 's not like they go into another country and steal , rape , or hell , even murder someone , and then you would , like anyone else , reasonably expect them to have a trial , these treasonous cunts are hunted down while they are part of isis . 
  and rightfully so . 
  a *** whole hour ? 
  *** * you poor , unfortunate , tormented soul . 
  you disgust me . 
  also itt : some brits defending their corrupt scum . 
  * hillarious . 
   you can point to them misleading the public `` misleading '' ? 
  mate , that shit ai n't `` misleading '' , it 's an outright conspiracy , staging an entire criminal operation . 
  they were lucky that they were brits , otherwise diicot would 've thrown them in jail . 
  and i 'm pretty sure that 's not the only time this criminal cunts have gone and outright lied about shit . 
  i do n't know about you , but i 'd rather read biased shit than outright manufactured fake shit . 
   but there are far stricter rules on televised news so it is difficult for them to be really biased . 
  except for the bit where they paid some of our romanians to act like gun smugglers , giving them a script and instructions how to dress and shit , staging an entire fake report . 
  but hey !, 
  beside that , i 'm sure it is difficult for them to be really biased given them far stricter rules you 've been talking about . 
  do n't forget sky news .

  what 's really happening is that most of those people are too dumb to know their own rights , so they 're being lied to and they go along because they do n't know any better . 
  i say , good luck imposing that number on poland ... : d, 
  they will probably say that they rejected it because they want to replace it with a much harsher one at a ^ later ^ date in all honesty , i think they are really scared of what 's happening in romania . 
  : \\ bulgarians should vote for small , new political parties to take power away from the main , established ones . 
  with that dissolution of power in the parliament , a bill like this stands a greater chance of passing . 
  necessary `` yurop stronk '' comment . 
  it 's true , i do slam the keyboard quite hard , but not because i 'm raging , but because it 's a filco mechanical , blue switch keyboard and my god is it a pleasure to type on ... but yes , it 's loud too . 
  edit : i do get a little overzealous : \\, 
  you know ** nothing ** about eu law . 
  as a romanian i can travel without a passport , work , move , buy property , sell property , rent , live , marry , in ** any ** eea ( not just eu but norway and switzerland too , correction , switzerland did limit immigration because it can , as it is not part of the eu ) , without even ever learning the local language . 
  there is not 3 month restriction on anything . 
  as a swede you have only a few more rights in sweden than i have as a romanian . 
  i 'm not going to answer your other points ; it 's just your own belief / speculation . 
  and if i get married or i 'm in a relationship with a non-eu citizen , say a nice asian girl ; ) , she can get a visa based on that , in any eu country i live in . 
  that 's how far eu rights extend . 
  all i 'm saying is that for immigrants staying in the new country permanently is not always the best option because the same money will go a much longer way in another place . 
  i never said romas . 
  roma build much bigger but tasteless houses with begging money . 
  that 's a matter of policy . 
  cutting welfare for abusers and encouraging them to move back if they do n't want to respect and adapt to local laws . 
  they would if the region was at peace ... : \\, 
  the new migrants will have the same option romanians and bulgarians have as well , i imagine . 
  work 20 years to buy a 2 bedroom apartment in berlin or frankfurt , or work 2-3 years and build a house in syria . 
  but before that , the eu needs to focus on peace in syria . 
  this one is quite nice .

  ** in the same way it 's reasonable to think that syrians might be interested in moving back at some point too . 
  my point is , both romania and bulgaria and poland , as well as western agriculture and industry have benefited immensely from the free movement of workers . 
  and if people are building new houses in romania , it means they plan to come back once they 've made their lives a little better ? 
  so they 're not `` slaves '' and neither will refugees be slaves if they earn some money and start re-building their houses in syria . 
  go to school , learn something probably . 
  but that 's up to them and the german government , not me .

  there 's probably millions of new houses all across romania , all worked for in western agriculture or industry . 
  or something they will recondition old houses , https://www.google.com/maps/@47.110362,24.6288597,3a,75y,148.69h,86.71t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sztr9uw6rx02ydc6o-sz4oq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=ro all day .

  they return to romania and use the 10x salary to build houses .

  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jyeeh/national_front_merkel_wants_migrants_as_slaves/cutbjc5 so show me french people willing to do this job for just 2-4 months / year . 
  no dutch person would post a picture of that piece of shit twice after he killed hundreds of dutch , so the odds that you are indeed a paid troll just went up . 
  look here and tell me germans will do these jobs , seasonally on a 2-4 month basis . 
  there are countless seasonal jobs in agriculture that germans wont do . 
  especially picking shit like cucumbers or tomatoes . 
  trust me , it 's a win-win . 
  yea , i 'd take a shit on his face too . 
  they are wrong . 
  it 's the same as saying romanians and bulgarians are slaves , which is ridiculous when they get paid 10 times what they make in romania or bulgaria . 
  1/3 of french are probably fed up with some aspects of their society , but nf are traitors paid by putin so fuck them right in the ass : ], 
  i understand there are people who `` have an agenda '' ( mainly dumb kids behind a keyboard ) , but i hope that does n't mean that nobody can create negative posts about a certain situation . 
  there are clear negative as well as positive aspects of the refugee crisis and i hope to be able to discuss both , equally . 
  after all , if you ca n't openly talk about a problem , you have no chance of solving it . 
  are you back from holiday ?

  the point my german friend here is trying to make is that batteries are expensive as s#@t ... and people will care about how many they can buy before they care what it looks like in their basement . 
  and i tend to agree . 
  but it might be different in sf where people might buy it to show off to their friends ; i imagine having a dinner party and then taking your guests to the garage to see the wonder and give them the tech-talk on how much kw and mw and watts and volts and such and such . 
  must be due to that gas pipeline germany has agreed to build for russia in the north . 
  : ] cuddly bear when he has no money . 
  exactly . 
  i do n't know . 
  but i do know it 's out of whack in china and they face serious social problems when 50 million men ca n't find a wife right now . 
  mercedes will apparently sell home batteries too . 
  and i assume siemens as well ? 
  goddammit turkey . 
  so true . 
  but romanian politicians are incredibly stupid . 
  that 's only because women live longer than men , so the discrepancy is in old age , not in the 20-40 year range . 
  besides , i got pissed off because he has no idea what he 's talking about . 
  having lived in norway for a year , as a romanian immigrant i know the situation a little better than he does . 
  local women in a rich country as well as immigrant women prefer local men because the one thing that women value way more than confidence or looks , is money . 
  the immediate assumption was that i was a poor immigrant and finding any girl who would do more than have a conversation with me , no matter how confident my approach , was damn near impossible . 
  and i look good too . 
  only when they found out that i was actually quite well off financially in romania would i get any attention at all . 
  way to generalize an entire nation without any data or numbers . 
  if i said that most middle eastern or african immigrants are potential criminals , how would that sound ? 
  god , you 're stupid . 
  and even if your stupid remark had any substance , you would still have a social problem , which is the limit of what i said , since having a large number of men not able to get married , is a social problem regardless of their race or ethnicity . 
  then we should show them the door , should n't we ? 
  if these men do n't have wives or girlfriends to bring over once they get settled in , we 'll have a bit of a social problem on our hands . 
  so childish ... 
  * in 2015 * is it more expensive to house 3-4 million people in an expensive country such as germany over the coming years , or would be better to fund a eu army and set up safe-zones and safe-cities in the countries where these people come from . 
  provide them with free food and free construction materials to rebuild their homes there , in a safe environment protected by a eu army . 
  housing all of them in europe will cost upwards of 50 billion euros , or more , in the next 4 years , for sure . 
  and it 's 10 billion in 2015 , before most of them have even arrived in germany . 
  add to that the cost of processing them all , the added risk of terrorism , etc. . . 
  if next year germany takes in 1 million , and another million after that , the cost will be 40 billion / year , no doubt, 
  in this case , the bribers accepted to work with the police . 
  so to prove that the transfer had taken place , each bill was marked . 
  it 's a common procedure . 
  sometimes , especially in the us , tiny `` bombs '' filled with fluorescent liquid are place in bags or suitcases so the suspect is covered in it . 
  last i checked psd is a political party and if they think that having his as a leader wont affect their popularity that 's a case of the romanian people being too stupid , not a problem of the judicial system . 
   through transparency and renewal of personnel ( as in firing everyone and bringing in a younger generation ) romania , as opposed to georgia is a eu member state and there are laws against such discriminatory actions .

  i do n't think any country will allow uk to have any more opt outs . 
  in the end , eu aims for a political and economical union . 
  but then again look at sweden . 
  we 're not giving her away to the eu . 
  she will not have time for us anymore and boy , do we need her . 
  i think our president said we co-initiated this project , but i ca n't find english sources . 
  some eu citizens will leave for sure . 
  not all , of course . 
  it 's not just brexit , it 's the uk being different after brexit . 
  many of them prefer stability so they will either move back home or relocate in another eu country if they have the money . 
  it 's cheap because nobody punishes your companies for hiring them at a lower wage than they would a local . 
  portugalia the rebel . 
  sorry dude , i 'm not the one saying racists brexiters are only a meme . 
  but i guess it 's easy for you to say that . 
  those are not questionable sources at all . 
  did you want a link to the sun perhaps ? 
  so in the end , whether or not those murders were linked to brexit racists or not , attacks did happen and just because they did n't end up in murder does not mean they do n't matter . 
   they do not seem to think they were linked . 
  mhm . 
  okay , let 's scratch that if you think it was n't . 
  how about this : http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/uk-polish-man-latest-victim-hate-crime-surge-160913153112373.html http://www.dw.com/en/eastern-european-migrants-in-the-uk-face-growing-hostility/a-19562199, 
   the eu has negatively impacted british lives and livelihoods lol , did it really ? 
  i do n't think people were mad that the uk wanted to leave , i think people were mad that instead of making a decision on facts , they voted based on ukip 's propaganda . 
  okay , but they 're certainly not a meme . 
  they are people who have attacked eu citizens in the uk . 
  some were even killed . 
  we should not make light of that either . 
  both the eu and the uk should address this issue first thing . 
  the lives of people should not be a * bargaining chip * . 
  this is a whole new level of `` are you really sure you want to proceed ? '' . 
  lol, 
  [ i guess we should listen and watch this video once again to remember where we were and where we are now . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4rjjkxsamq ), 
  by  there 's no hard and soft brexit when it comes to citizens . 
  i meant that i assume that uk will be more sensible than this :  healthy poo consistency : no access to public fund and have to pay an nhs surcharge . 
   penultimate hardness : you can stay as long as you either earn # 38k , work in the nhs or work in a doctororal level job . 
   they 're in a very good relations with uk and ready to sacrifice a lot on eu stage to further their own political games . 
  well then i hope they 'll be reasonable . 
  there 's no hard and soft brexit when it comes to citizens . 
  uk would be really dumb not to agree on talking about this first thing . 
  secure the rights of eu citizens and uk nationals and then we can fight on whatever else , but this is something that needs immediate attention and a lot of sensible discussion . 
   imagine if an eastern european country blocks a deal for whatever reason , that will cause a lot of tension internally . 
  i hate how you put that . 
  after all , it 's not like doing something they do n't have the right to do . 
  but we will most likely not block anything unless our inputs are not taken into consideration and the deal goes against ee interests in a really bad way . 
  pretty spot on for romania . 
  our president has said that the most important thing is securing rights for eu citizens in the uk , but that obviously also means securing rights for uk nationals . 
  he does n't want the people to have to go through really scary times and not know what will happen to them . 
  he wants the eu and the uk to really settle this in a way everyone will know what their future holds and what to do to get through brexit . 
  i do n't believe in either soft or hard brexit , i believe the eu must conclude their priorities and stand their ground when they have to . 
  there are certain things which you can not compromise . 
  we had 20c yesterday . 
  ouch . 
  yes , of course . 
  well , i assume it 's half circlejerk , half really feeling bad . 
  nothing wrong with some people feeling bad about the whole thing . 
  it is certainly not a pleasant scenario for some . 
  and humor releases tension . 
  i think scottish independence will make it even more important and defining and historical . 
  [ ... ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/135e47vkw6tm6a/giphy.gif ), 
  you should definitely try to get some expert advice on that . 
  even if they do n't know exactly what will happen , they might tell you what 's best to do . 
  i 'm sure it wo n't happen overnight . 
  good luck uk !, 
  you 'll need it !, 
  maybe you can come back one day if you want !, 
  ^ ^ la ^ ^ revedere ^ ^ is ^ ^ kind ^ ^ of ^ ^ like ^ ^ until ^ ^ we ^ ^ meet ^ ^ again ^ ^ so ... ^ ^ maybe . 
   take any article about `` foreigner crime '' in any eastern european newspaper . 
  that same article could just as well be from a western european newspaper from the 60s . 
  i do n't know what that means . 
   we 've been there , done that . 
  and now we tend to have a holier-than-thou attitude about it . 
  yeah , i guess being safe from russian occupation and communism does that . 
  romania will start a campaign to inform parents of the dangers of not vaccinating your child . 
  first they * must * meet with a couple of specialists that will give them proper information and then if they still refuse to vaccinate their child they will have to sign a document that says they 're responsible for what happens to their child . 
  the parents who refuse to take part in this procedure ( counseling + signing the form ) might be sanctioned , but it is not clear yet on how . 
  initially they wanted to impose fines of 550 euros but that might not go through . 
  http://www.euractiv.com/section/health-consumers/news/lower-quality-of-same-food-brands-in-eastern-europe-raises-eyebrows/ for slovakia and hungary it is proved . 
  that 's cringy alright . 
  the brits are coming . 
  roma people , like any other citizens of the eu , are free to move within the eu . 
  if they do n't abide by the law , they can be sent back afaik . 
  what 's the problem ? 
  i thought western europe were masters at integrating minorities and they are never , ever racists or xenophobes . 
  and you know who else is net receiver ? 
  spain , belgium , greece , portugal , slovenia , slovakia , poland , cyprus , croatia , bulgaria , czechia , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , luxembourg and malta . 
  that is not fair or democratic . 
  we did take refugees . 
  wait a second , i 'll be back with relevant links that show you otherwise .

   if we had a constitution which said that we owned the earth , it would n't be tolerated internationally . 
  this example makes no sense . 
   `` might makes right '' no , might and especially russia 's might ends in mass murder for eastern countries , but it makes nothing right . 
  let 's remember how many of those russian minorities arrived in their host countries . 
  let 's remember the deportations of the locals . 
  it 's not as simple as you think it is . 
  yep . 
  a lot of people from russian minorities intentionally create problems for the host country ... and a lot of them are in said countries because russia occupied those countries by force in the time of the soviet union and deported locals to places like siberia . 
  even if that was the case , i do n't know , all i can say is ... fuck the soviet union and whatever they promised to it . 
  the soviet union does not exist anymore .

  they 've got great fans , some years ago i was listening [ to this video of them ] each day , several times a day . 
  and crypto-coin mining . 
  actually , i 've heard of friends-of-friends who got a nice stash of cash out of it ( between 30,000 to 100,000 euros ) , but for every case like that that 's tens or hundreds of other cases who are too late to the game . 
  i guess that 's how a bubble builds itself . 
  after the battle of mohachs in 1526 they reached central europe where they staid for the next 200 years or so . 
  as a matter of fact there 's some minarets less than 100 km from where i 'm writing this comment ( bucharest ) , and they 've been there for the last 600-700 years , give or take . 
  i 'm talking about the muslim community living in ne bulgaria . 
  ah , yeah , right , 
  right now weather.com tells me that there 's 80 % humidity in monaco , at [ this link ] ( https://weather.com/wx/today/?lat=43.74&amp;lon=7.42&amp;locale=en_us&amp;par=google&amp;temp=c ) . 
  it 's 9.55 pm on there . 
  i searched around other cities in that general geographic area and i found out that for example udine and brescia both have humidity level in the high 60s , even though they 're several hundred kilometers inland . 
  you can make safer and surer bets than this one . 
   oh and he killed 52 aristocratic families ( 1/3 to a half of bulgarian aristocracy of the time ) including the woman and children related to this , there 's an apocryphal story reguarding our own vlad the impaler and his building of the [ poenari castle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poenari_castle ) . 
  for a reason that i forgot he forced many boyars , together with their wife and children , to help with the building of the castle , in gruesome conditions . 
  one of the boyars starts complaining : `` your highness , my wife is pregnant , can you please spare her the carrying of big rocks ? '' . 
  at which vlad responds : `` from now on she 'll have to carry two rocks , one for her , and one for the baby inside her '' . 
  still one of the greatest rulers we 've ever had . 
   i at least unserstand it now . 
  never realized soccer being so intwined with religion though to this day most of us rapid fans see [ steaua ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fc_steaua_bucure%c8%99ti ) and [ dinamo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fc_dinamo_bucure%c8%99ti ) as communist teams imposed by the occupying soviet troops immediately after ww2 , it does n't get any more political than that . 
  we sort of tend to ignore that our own team was supported by [ gheorghe gheorghiu-dej ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gheorghe_gheorghiu-dej ) , the biggest communist ruler in our country after ww2 and before ceausescu came to power , because he had been a railways worker and our team is , by definition , the team of railways workers from all over romania ( or at least it was so when it was founded , back in 1923 ) . 
  glad it was n't divan . 
  idomemo\u0219 is a hit and miss , is definitely a miss if you 've got a weaker stomach or you caught the cook during a day when he forgot to wash his hands , but if you 've got a stronger stomach it can be actually good for the prices they demand . 
  i for myself have only eaten there twice of thrice , but i 've completely started to avoid them ( even though i work only a block away from them ) since i 've started feeling that my stomach is not what it used to be when i was younger . 
   i would make absolutely no difference and ca n't tell if it 's a video about romanian or bulgarian village . 
  the clothes , the look of the people , the little things in the shop . 
  i grew up in a romanian city on the danube just across from bulgaria , and my parents now live in a small village nearby ( as did my grand-parents and grand-grand-parents ) . 
  when i first visited bulgaria as a grown-up i was surprised to see that the houses looked exactly the same as my grandma 's house , that the old ladies were dressing the same as my grandma , that they were holding their hands around their mouths just as my grandma was doing etc. 
  i always tell my friends that there 's a much bigger difference between the people where i grew up and the romanians from transylvania ( there 's about 300-400 km separating them ) , from example , than between the same people and the bulgarians that live just across the danube . 
  which , if you put it this way in writing makes sense , but when you learn in school that the romanian people is unique and not like any other people out-there then you start having doubts , as a kid . 
  we also imported the [ kukeri ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kukeri ) tradition from the bulgarians ( we call them * cuci * ) , and i was very surprised when i grew up and went to bucharest ( that 's 120 km away from my home city ) and found out that people over there had n't heard of it . 
  we also have the tradition of hanging a black piece of cloth with the name of the deceased person on the walls of said deceased person 's house , which again i was surprised to see that 's not known and not practised in bucharest . 
  too lazy to search for links but there have been countless articles on / r/europe about how food is more expensive in the former eastern bloc countries compared to the western ones ( mostly prices in poland and czechia vs germany ) . 
  sort of the same thing happens for clothes . 
  for example over here in romania you almost never can find decent clothes during the sales season at more than a 20 % price discount , which is ridiculous , imho , while in greece ( and in vienna , barcelona or , heck , even london ) i was able to find pretty decent clothes at 70-80 % discount during the sales season . 
  matter of fact i still have a couple of excellent t-shirts that i bought at primark in london for 5 pounds each 7 years ago . 
  might actually do that , thx for reminding me  we drive by car all the way south to piraeus and i was torn between spending the night in thessaloniki or somewhere in the vicinity . 
  i think we 'll choose thessaloniki . 
  told my gf that we should vacation somewhere in the greek islands later this summer so that we could shop on ermou street on our way there ( the sales prices are much smaller in greece compared to what we get here in romania ) . 
  actions like this one make me want to reconsider . 
  you 're an interista , are n't you ? 
  feel free to join us watching cl football anytime you want , 
   people tend to perceive countries like greece , italy , spain through the tourist bubble they experience when visiting during holidays i love greece , but even as a tourist if you care enough to open your eyes you can see the painful changes the country has had to go through . 
  there was a huge difference between me visiting athens as a tourist in 2007 ( before the crisis started ) and again in 2012 and 2013 . 
  during the later visits there were huge piles of garbage on the side of the street and the number of homeless people seemed to have had grown exponentially . 
  but , yeah , if you 're taking a charter flight directly to the cyclades or if you 're driving your estate skoda octavia directly to igoumenitsa , halkidiki or thassos you might not experience this as a tourist . 
   german/swedish/french / american manager visiting us next week ( he will buy a beer for everyone !, 
  ) , and yeah . 
  this is so accurate ... a friend of mine had his german manager visit his company in may , just as juventus was about to play against monaco in the cl semi-final ( said friend is a huge juve fan , as am i ) . 
  he had to `` entertain '' his german boss after work , cussing and swearing that he 's losing the game , but he finally convinced the german guy to come watch the second half of the match with him in the pub where all of us bucharest-based juve fans were drinking and shouting our lungs out . 
  the german guy seemed lost , like the woman anthropologist character in the [ taz cartoons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tasmanian_devil_%28looney_tunes%29 ) . 
  not a fun of kebab myself , but i 'd say that turkish cuisine is in many respects better than french and italian food . 
  it 's really , really hard to go wrong with any turkish-made food , while in both france and more recently italy i 've had huge hit-and-misses with my food . 
  a couple of months ago we dined in a pretty nice turin restaurant but the food was like what you 'd get in a hospital ( apparently it was a local specialty , did n't bother to remember its name ) . 
  i agree , some french and especially italian food can be out of this world , but i 'd say that turkish ( and middle-eastern ) cuisine is better over-all . 
  damn !!, 
  rip ... 
  yeah , in our case i think it 's also a matter of the local aromanians having a bigger pool from where to choose . 
  looking at my mother 's and brother 's skin color i can also say that i have gipsy blood through my veins ( i turned up white-er , after my dad ) . 
  you 're of course correct , people do n't talk that much about the gipsies that have managed to integrate , so much so that i 've recently started to believe more and more that `` being a gipsy '' is more a social thing/social construct and that it does n't have anything to do with skin color . 
  i mean , if i see you doing gipsy-like things then i 'll treat you like a gypsy , no matter what color your skin is . 
   there are not many of them in macedonia ( fewer than 10000 i think ) but they hold significant economic and political power the same as they do in romania . 
  one of our former billionaires ( i think he 's now `` only '' a millionaire ) and [ infamous football club owner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gigi_becali ) is of aromanian origins . 
  most of them have been re-settled in [ dobruja ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dobruja ) , and whenever i visit [ constanta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constan%c8%9ba ) i 'm surprised by how many expensive cars i see on the city 's streets ( it rivals bucharest in this regard ) . 
  also , they very rarely marry outside of their community , at least here , in romania . 
  a former ( woman ) friend of mine was in a relationship with an aromanian ( very nice guy ) , and when it came to them marrying there was a big no-no coming from the guy 's aromanian family because my friend was romanian ( they eventually split up ) . 
   this is a business not a social circus !, 
  then politicians like macron should not complain when eastern-european workers take the most sensible economic decision and decide to work in the west for less pay than the westerners but for a lot more than they 'd get at home . 
  lidl is paying its cashiers around 1700-2000 ron ( that 's 370 - 400 euros ) , and they 're genuinely seen as paying the highest salaries on this market ( article in romanian [ here ] ( http://www.zf.ro/companii/lidl-arunca-manusa-a-crescut-salariile-angajatilor-si-acum-angajeaza-500-de-persoane-ce-salariu-castiga-un-angajat-la-lidl-16173169 ) ) . 
  afaik auchan and the like pay about 1,000 - 1,200 ron , that 's 200-250 euros . 
  those latter salaries are a joke . 
   they are not paid french minimum wage . 
  they do n't respect french labor laws if the french hyper-market chains like carrefour , cora and auchan had paid decent salaries in the eastern european markets that they now dominate ( like romania ) and not expatriate back to france most of their profits then you 'd probably not see that many eastern european workers `` stealing '' the jobs from the the western european workers on their home turf . 
  i 'm really looking forward for macron to also talk about this issue , which he can directly influence ( by having a chit-chat with the french capitalists who control those hyper-market chains ) . 
  but i expect he wo n't . 
   i think the other slavic countries do n't use that name anymore though , can anyone confirm ? 
  people in wallachia and moldova used to call it tsarigrad , too , even though we 're not slavic ( ok , maybe we 're 30 % slavic , but we like to believe that we 're 50 % romans and 50 % dacians ) . 
  the reason is that the official language of the court documents was a form of slavonic . 
  the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visigoths#nomenclature:_vesi.2c_ostrogothi.2c_tervingi.2c_greuthungi ) gives a long explanation of the ostrogoth vs the visigoth nomenclature , but all i need to know is [ this image ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visigoths#/media/file:gutthiuda.jpg ) which rightly shows that both of those tribes started their conquest of europe from our beautiful romania ( which was not called romania back in the day , but it does n't matter , really ) . 
  which proves that whatever the visigoths and the ostrogoths got to conquer should be rightfully ours . 
  i think for the modern era napoleon wins it . 
  he was the guy that almost invented modern warfare ( and , like it or not , warfare is one of the main characteristics of the past 200 years ) , his civil code is practiced almost all over europe ( the same as the romans ' laws had survived well into the middle ages ) and he was also one of the first guys who actually tried to put a stop to the french revolution ( which in my opinion is the defining event of the modern era ) . 
  he managed to do it , for a while . 
   my closest lake town is nyon was called noviodunum and has an amphitheater and old walls and columns . 
  a town [ on the danube in romanian dobruja ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noviodunum_%28castra%29 ) used to also be called noviodunum back in the roman times , and while looking for the wiki page i found out that there used to be [ several settlements ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noviodunum ) called like that in those times , apparently noviodunum means `` new fort '' in celtic . 
  i always seem to forget how important the celts used to be for europe , they were spanning the entire continent before the romans did their thing . 
  there were lots of fake ads on olx when i was looking for a bucharest rental a couple of years ago . 
  after a while you learned to spot them , but it was still frustrating . 
  olx.ro is how i purchased my sh car , though , so they 're not entirely bad . 
   i talked to a friend today that said she was nervous , that her boyfriend ( and father of her newborn child ) was going to a concert . 
  i am going to a festival next weekend , and my mother was nervous . 
  i have a friend ( works in it , early 30s ) who said to his wife that there 's no way they 're going to a coldplay concert in hannover . 
  at first i thought that was because , well , he does n't like coldplay ( i 'm in that boat , too ) , but it turns out that he 's scared about any terror-related incidents that might happen while they 're attending the concert . 
  others have mentioned it , but i would n't put dostoyevsky and kafka on a list of * philosophers * . 
  they 're great writers ( i 'm a fan of them both ) , but their writings just seem to be more literary than philosophical ( not that 's anything wrong with that ) . 
  sartre has been over-valued for some time now ( even more so when you get older than 20 ) , kierkegaard answers a lot of your questions when you 're 17-18 ( at least , that 's how it worked for me ) but once you grow a little older and look for the answers to other , more important questions , you sort of move on from where he had left you . 
  i 'd say nietzsche and camus are still actual with their questions ( even though nietzsche 's god-thing quotation and thoughts are also way over-valued ) . 
  seems like an american-influenced list , or at least what americans would think when they hear about `` european philosophers '' . 
  auchan , of course . 
  this post might have just convinced me of going to catania/sicily this september . 
  i was torn between andalusia , portugal and sicily .

  at least you acknowledge my age superiority and wisdom ... even if i 'd gladly scratch your face for that * `` granny * '' !,

  yes but using english internet could change your mind not only about your actual system of gov but about many things like : lgbt rights , human rights , your right to a lawyer . . etc  kinda like it was for us here .

  having www on your disposal and do n't use it ? 
  not to mention that for some `` situations '' you got only one part of the story . 
  that 's another chapter of `` dictators little handbook '' unfortunately , making people lazy ... even in their minds . 
  it 's quite normal since you have a giant , like the russian internet , on your disposal . 
  and your economy/system does n't really push youngsters to learn english or any western language since it 's of no use .

  some of those most ancient thingies look like sz\u00e9kely runes .

  nah ... if i 'd had a dirty mind i would 've said `` it looks like a damn catholic arse in need for an iron spike '' . 
  it kinda look like an arse ... ( 0 . o ), 
  i 'm a stupid n\u00fc ren then hahaha e : because i did n't understood what you said . 
  i 'm a what ?!, 
  well ... at least i 'm aware now that we crossed our legs even in ancient china . 
   e : okay now , it was a joke for f. . . sake !, 
  ooookay ... ( o.o ) . 
  say again ?!?!,

  they 're the bo s ( s ) ... : ^ ), 
  what a. . . ?!, 
  ( 0 . o ) i 'll be scared to ask for a map with how they call the people living in those countries . 
  seriously now . 
  how does a hungarian woman would be called in mandarin ? 
  edit : my country 's name is so stereotypically chinese . 
  south park would be proud . 
  he does n't have the best czech words . 
  in czechia and slovenia . 
  to visit his in-laws . 
  yeah right hahahaha, 
  neither am i a city . 
   do n't worry i live in a small village too . 
  czech republic president material right here . 
  til any drunkard look like a crook for danes . 
  in romania even villages have coa . 
  i guess it 's for ... tradition sake ? 
  i understand it 's not exactly its flag/coa but more of a logo . 
  what ?!, 
  ankara has a huge history ( look up for ancyra ) . 
  not to even start about the other places in anatolia or the european part of turkey . 
  you have lot 's of history there , more than most of us . 
  our president would be quite a unifier . 
  when you have an idiot in power trying hard to be an islamic putin you got that . 
  it would be laughable if it would n't be sad . 
  for turkey and all of us . 
  that made in the u.s.a. spoils the pic big time ! ^ / s : ^ d, 
  wow it looks like something coming from an engine !, 
  you 're right . 
  but this pic still give me a cozy home-like feeling . 
  have three of those a fountain in each of them and food for one year . 
  those guy who want to get them will loose some time before get them all and in the mean time your real army is there . 
  surprise !, 
  weirdest castle i ever seen ( in pics ) . 
  i guess it was even weirder for the one who tried to get it . 
  nice !, 
  those hills look so much as the hills surrounding my village . 
  incredible but i feel like home when i look at this picture ... bar the mountain unfortunately . 
  i have no idea what 's that . 
  everything !, 
  i 'm very curious about those things . 
  i guess it 's like lesbianism is for guys . 
  interesting . 
  tell me more !, 
  at least you 're gay ? 
  or is only some strange fetish ? 
  please teach me about men , oh you great lord of darkest sexuality !, 
  exactly !,

  they have . 
  anyway , i think we clarified it . 
  rom has some personality but i always liked poiana and africana better . 
  not true , they had met several times since the annexation of crimea , both in multilateral and bilateral settings . 
  see message of nato secretary general http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_129818.htm, 
  ok , got it , thanks . 
  of course , if they break the law , they should be prosecuted ( or whatever measure spanish law provides for that ) . 
  if you worked legally and paid your social contributions in spain , including for unemployment , i do n't see why you could n't ask for unemployment the moment you are left unemployed , whether you are a romanian , a spanish or an iraqi . 
  or it is that romanian workers should only pay the social contributions/taxes in spain , but not benefit from them when needed ? 
  exactly , it 's much less likely to have conflicts with a country which is hundreds of thousands of km away . 
  people 's views are also determined by how rich/developed/successful a country is . 
  bulgaria is not seen as a rich/developed/successful country . 
  in some aspects ( corruption , organized crime , their love of russia ) they are seen as doing worse than us ( in the case of russia , worse means they like it much more than us ) , thus the result . 
  yes , it should be better but you know the reasons and i think you also know that hungarians views on romanians are not any better . 
  if i were to guess , over 75 % positive . 
  i would be difficult not to like the italians . 
  besides all the things other people like the italians for , you also have in romania this feeling of kinship , the fact that we are related , that we have the same ancestors ( which is of course a bit naive/romantic but has also a clear historical/cultural/linguistic base ) . 
  i mean , our language and the name of our people and of our country comes from the romans/the roman empire , thus from rome . 
  how could we hate rome ? 
  and luxembourg . 
  that and also not experiencing the sort of massacres our bulgarian neighbors experienced in 1876 helps as well . 
  no reason for that . 
  attitudes would be very ( 70 % + ) positive . 
  honestly , you are bit far away so people do n't think about you that much . 
  but if you were to ask romanians what they think about australians you 'll get very positive views . 
  a big part of the reason in my view . 
  at the fall of the soviet union romanians knew ( because they were educated in that way ) that moldovans from the former soviet republic are romanians just like all of us romanians . 
  we have more moldovans in romania ( where it 's a regional identity ) than in the republic of moldova so why should those newly independent moldovans be different from our moldovans , which identify 100 % with the romanian nation ? 
  they thought . 
  so lots of love and desire for union form the romanian side . 
  and then came the shock , of discovering that many moldovans did n't identify as romanians and some were also quite anti-romanian , others confuse and so forth . 
  i mean sure , there are a lot of moldovans that identify as romanians , including most o their ` intellectuals ' ( professors etc. . ) but when you look at the whole society ... 
  so most of the negative feeling in my view comes from this rejection . 
  many romanians ( happily not the majority ) felt rejected by their brothers/their own and that 's not an easy thing to swallow . 
  to add to that , israel and romania have very good relations . 
  romania was the only communist country that did n't break diplomatic relations with israel after the 1967 six-day war and these kind of things matter ; moreover , many israelis have romanian jewish ancestry , the romanian community being at that time the largest jewish community in europe to survive wwii , after the one in russia . 
  the israeli airforce has been training in romania ( we have more airspace than they do , and mountains ) , the israelis have some good investments in romania and there are also good trade relations . 
  so their institutions would have really no interest to attack romania 's anti-corruption chief and also risk damaging those bilateral relations . 
  their embassy in bucharest announced today that no israeli institutions are involved in this case . 
  these look to be just israeli citizens , yes , former mossad employees but private citizens , who broke the law and will have to face the justice system now . 
  it might be that or maybe some of the romanians under investigation thought to contract some `` external services '' . 
  tough luck for them . 
   still , annexation is a strong word . 
  are you serious ? 
  having the troops of one state invade the territory of another , followed by a sham referendum and the administrative inclusion of that territory into the territory of the invading country is not annexation ? 
   romanian-romanian writing romanian once is enough . 
  dictionaries are not only those that translate words , they can also offer definitions , etymologies , phonetics , pronunciations , and other information . 
  honestly , i prefer the old look and clearly the tabbed menubar over those side-hover-buttons . 
  regarding the logo my suggestion would be not to make it too eu-land . 
  i live in brussels , i 'm happy we have the eu but let 's not push those stars more than it 's needed ( i know the flag is not just the eu one , but also council of europe etc. . ) . 
  i followed their advice and added the website to the whitelist of my adblockplus and it does n't work , i just get again the damn quote . 
  stolen by politicians + criminals , though the two categories tend to partially overlap , especially in moldova . 
  that is total nonsense . 
  indeed , those are all legitimate questions . 
  i live in brussels , yesterday i was several hundred meters from the bombing site , and i have serious questions/doubts about the capabilities and professionalism of the belgian authorities . 
   homogenous romania does n't have a homogenous society , ethnically or religiously , which is fine . 
  there are problems of integration , especially regarding parts of the roma community , but though difficult , i think they are easier to solve on the long term than the integration problems some western european countries are facing with some of their minorities . 
  no , still the moldovans are the poorest . 
   reasonably adapt ? 
  they are the poorest country in europe no , sheriff does n't pay taxes in moldova . 
  text in english bulgaria has outplayed romania in any aspect long ago : pm sofia . 
  `` bulgaria has outplayed romania in any aspect long ago , '' bulgaria prime minister boyko borisov said in an interview with nova tv , asked to comment on when bulgaria would catch up with neighbouring romania . 
  asked about when and how bulgaria outplayed romania in terms of fight against corruption , prime minister borisov said : `` their ministers are stealing and eventually got caught and imprisoned , while their president is looking for asylum in moldova . 
  i do not see any bulgarians escaping to romania . '' borisov agreed to the statement that there were no convicted politicians in bulgaria probably because there were not any corrupted people among them . 
  `` i find the prevention most important . 
  i know that i do my best not to let them steal and they know that whoever i catch will leave immediately , '' the bulgarian prime minister commented further . 
  according to borisov , the negative ec report was due to the fact that the country was government by former prime minister plamen oresharski for a year and a half . 
  `` we enjoy brussels ' full support , of all our colleagues there , for everything we have done in the past month , and everyone came to say `` our boyko is back '' , '' boyko borisov commented further . 
  he added that romanian companied came to do business in bulgaria because it was better to work here and the country was more stable and predictable .

  indeed , he does n't seem to want to die . 
  hope that this `` weakness '' will also make him cooperative in what concerns the inquiry . 
  i live in brussels so after two anti-terrorist interventions this week , i 'm happy hearing the good news . 
  i also hope the belgians will improve and catch more of these fuckers before they hit . 
  i agree and i wish that to be the case but i think russia is in a different situation , has in good part a different political culture/tradition and has and will have less incentives to cooperate with its european neighbors . 
  not being fatalistic or anti-russian here , i would really like them to turn into a more democratic , friendlier and easier-to-deal-with neighbor but historic experience and the current realities do n't give me great hope . 
  do you think that russia has any chance in turning into post-wwii de-nazified western germany ? 
  i do n't see it . 
  russia is very likely to remain more or less the same , with or without putin . 
  exactly . 
  `` the fundamental rights agency ( fra ) , an eu office in vienna , said in a report on wednesday ( 16 march ) that the problem is at its worst in bulgaria , hungary , italy , latvia , poland , romania and slovakia . '', 
  i 'm sure italians would not be happy being put there with us easterners . 
  they are not , the name is also found in neighboring romania , and both countries have quite a diversity of surnames so probably smth like 3 % of the population would be called rusu ( the russian ) . 
  we need an albanian here ( who wants to talk about it ) . 
  nothing major in most cases . 
  he would have needed to pay some small bribes . 
  you can visit transnistria from moldova . 
  btw , moldavia is the name for the whole historical region , divided between romania , the republic of moldova and ukraine . 
  i saw rosa 's logo after i wrote my message . 
  comment still holds , both organisations could do better . 
  honestly polish space agency , you can do better . 
  can you offer any reference to this n-s highway that the eu wants romania to built and romania does n't want to ? 
  because i 've never heard about it . 
  please do n't be ridiculous and provincial . 
  no government hates having highways . 
  but between wanting and actually having the money to build them there is some distance . 
  resources are limited and choices need to be made . 
  among others , romania 's highways are necessary in order to export goods to the west , to central and western europe , where are our main export markets . 
  you are already close to the western border of romania so companies from your area have a much easier life in what concerns exports and transport costs . 
  highways need to be built to get to your part of the country , including from bucharest , which guess what , is by far the largest city of romania , as well as its cultural , industrial , and financial centre .

  when the victim is a poor persons the authorities will react slower . 
   do we ? 
  is n't that the argument : romania needs protection against russia and the only one that can provide it is the us ? 
  yes , what did germany do when russia invaded ukraine , they built pipes to russia . 
  europe ca n't and wo n't protect you against russia . 
  i think you are lying to yourself if you think otherwise . 
   we have in the eu an achean league . 
  a confederation that will either splinter in the face of a new master , or unite and become an entity of it 's own capable of defending itself and it 's members . 
  it has been done before , we 're not in new territory . 
  if the living conditions were approximately the same , if the wages were about the same in the whole union , then i believe it will be more unite but it is not the case , and if you force a closer relation it will splinter . 
  that 's my opinion . 
   it 's willfull ignorance to pretend at `` independence '' here , just polite vassalage . 
  well being a vassal state in history was n't an option . 
  you had no choice . 
  related to us , romania has a choice , and i believe it too the right call . 
  well yeah , it 's protection they are not forcing you to do anything . 
  it 's in our interest to have it . 
  a good economy needs a stable country where to thrive . 
   i 'm arguing that we have better protections inside the structure of the eu i think that is still an illusion . 
  after 2000 years of history of wars inside europe , i still think it is deeply divided regarding politics , world view , etc. 
  just look at views on war in libya , immigration , etc. 
  no one is looking for a hand to kiss , but some neighbors are nice and the relation is mutual beneficial and some neighbors are always following their own interest . 
   germany 's project continues because it 's been given the sovereignty to do so , and thinks it 's in its national self-interest . 
  fair point , but then again that shows that they do n't care about others . 
   the same way the us can trade us into the russian sphere if they ever felt they had something to gain from it . 
  you are wrong here . 
  us is not obliged to protect us . 
  they do it because they want . 
  the worst they can do is not ... 
  i hardly see that as `` trade us '' . 
  they are also the ones that keep you safe while germany builds pipes to russia . 
  you can have all our gypsies , they will make your economy go boom !, 
  yes failures are expected , but nasa gone for big things and many of them were achieved . 
  well because esa has much smaller project but still fails at them ? 
  get it ... 
  well all important space missions were nasa based . 
  they just successfully flew new horizons past pluto and are targeting an even father object . 
  esa can not even dream to accomplish that . 
   accomplished 75 % of its primary mission where did you get that ? 
  funny considering that the landing was a failure . 
   in 1961 yeah read that right . 
  when the best computers were no better than today 's pocket calculator . 
   `` nasa , once a failure , always a failure '' ? 
  stop your bullshit . 
  i did n't say nasa is a failure , did i ? 
   stop your bullshit . 
  this is very low-effort trolling . 
  how am i trolling ? 
  because i am not ass kissing a multi billion agency that is burning through it 's budget with little to show for it ? 
  i 'm saying that nasa is much more successful and has accomplished much greater things than esa . 
   esa will launch a rover in 2020 , if it succeeds , will esa still be a failure ? 
  for me it will take many successful missions to consider esa a success . 
  it has flopped so many times . 
  well considering nasa has 2 rovers taking a stroll on mars and one of them has lived 13 years on mars . . 
  i am not impressed . 
   each galileo satellite carries 4 clocks , not one satellite 's operational capability has been comprised because of this redundancy . 
  `` across the 18 satellites now in orbit , nine clocks have stopped operating . '', 
  that is very high considering that the satellites are brand new and galileo was operational only in december . 
  so there is the high probability that in future years some satellites will become useless . 
   mars express sadly the lander was n't . 
   galileo galileo itself is a partial failure . 
  over budget and late . 
  and if i remember correctly some of the satellites had clock failures . 
  come on ... that is the most important part of a navigation satellite . 
  i ca n't believe they fucked up this one also . 
   ariane 5 that 's awesome , but it 's first flight is like 20 years ago . 
  meanwhile they have a budget of +5 billion euro a year . 
  schiaparelli and philae , mars express from the top of my head , but i am sure there are many more . 
   because we all know that rocket science is easy and people from esa are usually dumb , unlike you so it 's fine the way it is ? 
  i mean if something is not working , maybe you change it ? 
  i am not . 
  but in my job if i failed the same times esa has failed i would have been fired long time ago . 
  no one is saying it 's easy but there are too many errors made . 
  because of the many failed mission it had ? 
  like most of them . 
  esa : once a failure , always a failure . 
  i said if it 's not political , religios or similar related . 
  how about the saudi official who killed the cyclist . 
  do you belive he should be tried in saudi arabia ? 
  you take medication for afflictions . 
  rarely you take medication to prevent something . 
  regarding studies ... there are so many studies that contradict themselves ... like for example the consumption of meat . 
  i have not found a definitively conclusion pro or against it . 
  can you share one that you consider as fact ? 
  yes , both are wrong . 
   the court can visit the witnesses in the other country or ask the local countries authorities for assistance with respect to the evidence gathering . 
  a witness has to be present in court to be questioned by both sides . 
  why not be trialed in the original country ? 
  it also is not a fact that it completely harmless for average people . 
  and i 'm not talking about short term . 
  i do n't believe you can say something will not affect you in like 20 years , because you ca n't conduct a study for a period that long . 
   banning smoking from public what does public mean ? 
  a park ? 
  how is me smoking in a park have effects on others . 
  a cars pollutes a million times per day than a smoker . 
   alcohol causes disease to only the person ingesting it that is far from the truth . 
  there are many where alcohol causes damage or deaths to other people including dui which is very common and also many people are violent when intoxicated . 
  from wiki :  in some countries , there exists a legal requirement for citizens to assist people in distress , unless doing so would put themselves or others in harm 's way . 
  many anti-vaccine believe the the vaccine is doing harm to themselves so this does not apply here . 
  you can also ban smoking and alcohol and no one would have smoking or alcohol related diseases also , right ?

   germany said * merkel said * i do n't trust that lady anymore . 
  as i see it , there are 2 reasons why she said that . 
  either : 1 . 
  she said it because her popularity declined and afd rose in the polls but she does n't mean it . 
  her government came to the conclusion that it 's nearly impossible to integrate most of the new people into the work-force . 
  because whichever way you turn it , germany needs more workers . 
  it needs people and there is absolutely no good reason to send the syrians back . 
  for a country which puts money and corporations way above national identity it does n't make sense to send them back , if they can integrate into the work-force . 
  dude . 
  is it polish or german press which self-censors on the topic of `` refugee '' crimes ? 
  is it pis or merkel working with facebook to delete any anti- `` refugee '' posts ? 
  how can you claim poland is more censoring than germany for the love of god ? 
  you currently have favorable terms with the us which pays for your national security , controls the seas of the world and thus a giant chunk of all international trade and allows you to export freely . 
  and that 's the only reason you can now afford to claim that you do n't care . 
  things change . 
  i think poles would be ok with paying to secure the borders . 
  which is what italy wants too . 
  if most germans think like you , i am not surprised the eu is failing ... as i tried to explain to you in several comments in this thread , you need a common european identity . 
  in the same way that i as a romanian living in transilvania am ok with paying taxes which go predominantly in moldova or in poor regions , because we are all romanian , the dutch should be ok with some of their taxes going into poorer regions because we are all european , in the same way americans are american and not just iowan or californian . 
  this is the only way to a federal europe and to get there , whether you like it or not , you need some european nationalism . 
  just the promise of perpetually living a good life wont do because sooner or later you have some crisis which tests your unity . 
  edit : and if the people of europe felt that the eu is worth the effort because of european nationalism and not because we were promised perpetual good lives , at some point when someone inevitably fucks up the common view should be : * `` god damn idiots greeks fucked up , i ca n't believe how stupid and corrupt they are , let 's make sure this never happens again but lets also make sure that they do n't get to 25 % unemployment because we 're all europeans and we just ca n't let that happen '' *, 
  it 's not that i changed my mind , i still hope to change the mind of others . 
   and greece got billions of euros from germany . 
  greece gets money so it can pay back german , french , italian and british banks . 
  those money just change hands for the sake of appearances . 
   i think about greece the same as about vw . 
  both fucked up horribly and both get some help . 
  the parallel between vw and greece is actually a great one because in each case we got leaders who fucked up , threatening the livelihoods of employees . 
  sure , fixing greece , spain and portugal is more expensive but if the well-being of vw employees is crucial for germany the well-being of greek employees is crucial for europe . 
  the greeks are quiet now , they have caved ; they 're broken , but , trust me that in their hearts the eu project is dead . 
  and i am a hypocrite btw , at that time i too thought ; fuck em ' let them suffer , they have it too good anyway ... it 's their fault they borrowed so much ... but i was too stupid to realize it 's not that simple . 
  if romanians have a crisis and get poorer , they understand the implications of poverty . 
  even i , as a software developer , still have property in the country-side where , if i lost everything , i could go right now and practice subsistence-agriculture ... keeping chickens , pigs , growing vegetables , whatever . 
  i understand the implications , i have been there before and i 'm not scared since i have a back-up which , in all honesty , is not half-bad . 
  it 's just a different life . 
  but in the case of greeks and spaniards you have fully developed societies with industrialized agriculture who have n't known poverty for decades and they have no back-up plan ; nowhere to land safely from such a fall . 
  their experience and mine , when confronted with an identical crisis , is completely different . 
   yes , but that is not the fault of germany ... 
  it does n't matter whos ' fault it is ... you just ca n't make the leap can you ? 
  you ca n't think of greeks in the same way you think of bavarians or in the same way you think of vw ... vw fucked up ... are you going to bail them out ? 
  fuck yea , you even got the eu parliament to change diesel emission standards until 2020 . 
  just imagine that you thought of greece the same as you do of vw , then you 'll finally understand where i 'm coming from . 
  nah , i do n't want that much money . 
  i do n't put money above all , i only write what i write to point out the lack of fairness , but i really do n't care if my car is a mercedes or a dacia , or if my phone is an iphone or some other . 
   i care about creating a union that can actually work a union of equal or at least similar countries where you do n't have to pay for some membersbecause the members are close enough . 
  you already mentioned that you 'd take scandinavia , you forget that finland is already the new sick economy of europe . 
  will you bail out the fins ? 
  you wo n't , you 'll just say , * `` oh i want a union without them ... 
  i want a union of equals '' * . 
   look at thow the greek crisis was handled does that really make you think that the german government only cares about the money ? 
  bwahahahah xd 46 % unemployment among young greeks ? 
  an entire generation of people , ** crushed ** . 
   you base a country around equals , you ca n't form a country of so vastly different countries . 
  yea i 'm sure the * founding fathers * of the united states thought exactly the same ... / s  so the substandce of a union should be that the richer states pay if someone fucks up ? 
  honestly if that is what a union is about why would a rich country be part of that ? 
  because of nationalism , but as a german you have an adversity towards it so probably even the word sounds dirty to you . 
  americans call it patriotism , just because they do n't want to use the `` n '' word because you kind of ruined it for everybody . 
  : p if you had n't and nationalism would n't be so stigmatized we could build a eu much faster . 
  on the contrary , it is german economy which is dependent on the free-market and on v4 + transilvania . 
  without the cheap parts you make here the price of your products would be too high to compete on the international market . 
  thus , even if you have an exports crisis in germany ... we 'll be fine because you 'll need us to lower the cost of your end products even more , in order to sell . 
  this is ** precisely why the polish economy never went into recession despite the 2008 crisis ** . 
  it was n't polish leadership or economic brilliance , it was german reliance on the cheap parts they make there . 
  or at least , this is my own opinion . 
   i personally think that it would be a more sensible thing to have a smaller area of unified fiscal policy with a transfer union between germany , the benelux , austria and france . 
  i 'd love the uk and scandinavia aswell see what you are doing ? 
  ** you are picking the rich countries who do well at this very moment . 
  ** that 's all you 're doing . 
  you just want to be part of a rich-country-club ; you do n't actually care about europe . 
  that 's because you , and german leaders , have put money before all . 
  money above europe . 
  a federal state , a country , can not be built on peace and prosperity because peace and prosperity are not * eternal * . 
  a country must be built on nationalism . 
  the only way to build europe is through nationalism at the eu level . 
  making europeans feel european and take pride in being european while holding on to their regional identities and nationalities . 
  instead , you are killing nationalism and trying to base a union on money . 
  that will never work . 
  and proof that it ca n't work is the response you give to whatever crisis might appear . 
  the substance of a federal state must be that germans , fins , swedes and whatnot , agree to bail out greeks and spaniards even if they fucked up , because they are european . 
  if you fail to do that , you fail to do everything else . 
  since we 're in a free-market and a political union , some % of german money , is made in eastern europe . 
  that 's our money too since we 're contributing to german prosperity whether we want to or not . 
  either by working and paying taxes there , or buying products in western-owned supermarkets or by working in factories which are part of the german industry , which pay shit salaries and all the added value of the final product stays in germany . 
  you could consider spain a large , rich country ... has spain made any political moves lately ? 
  ever since it had a massive crisis and 25 % unemployment , i have n't heard much of a spanish voice on eu matters . 
  the same could happen to germany if it had a serious exports crisis , replaced by v4 who even if they are not as large economically and the people earn considerably less , would remain healthy countries on account of not having internal problems . 
  when you do n't have internal problems , you being to think externally . 
  and italy , who is increasingly unhappy with franco-german monopoly on leadership , could replace france as the sickly but still relevant sidekick . 
  [ here 's a speech showing that poland is ready to use v4 to challenge germany ] ( https://youtu.be/pouzal6v-9q?t=3m36s ) based on that i see an interesting dynamic growing between v4 and italy inside the eu , to challenge franco-german dominance . 
  http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/italys-pm-matteo-renzi-criticises-franco-german-dominance-in-european-union-1271110 edit : spelling, 
  let 's have a eu-wide referendum on how to handle the `` refugee '' crisis and see what the european people say . 
  what do you think they will vote for ? 
  safe-zones in northern syria or taking in 5-6 million people , when we already have so many unemployed and underpaid europeans ? 
  can you not comprehend that when we are unemployed or underpaid , we can not share the same solution ? 
  germany is myopic and trying to appy the same medicine for different countries . 
  spain , greece , portugal and italy have a sovereign debt crisis ? 
  -  ** impose deficit limits for all eu countries , depriving romania , poland and other eastern countries from borrowing money to build infrastructure when gas , cement and steel are at their cheapest in decades ** . 
  germany has low unemployment and declining population , it needs workers ? 
  -  ** try to impose refugee quotas on underpaid countries to make it look like eu crisis even though your reasons for not securing the borders are entirely selfish .

  ** let the users decide what is or is not low quality or low effort . 
  that is the point of the upvote/downvote functionality . 
  ** in what way could i have put more effort into a simple holiday post ? 
  i used imgur ... what more do you want on an image ? 
  have you lost your mind ? 
  how about another `` euromaidan '' . 
  we send our army in , you send yours in transnistria , we shake hands across the dniester and call it a day ? 
  it 's pretty obvious that there 's no other future for this country . 
  edit : in return we become the first nato country to recognize crimea ( sorry ukrainians but you know you 're never really getting it back anyway ) and transnistria as part of russia ; it becomes a win-win . 
  well , shit ... 
  the prosperity of our entire continent depends on the automotive industry . 
  : ) `` too big to fail '' does n't even scratch the surface ... 
  is anyone surprised ? 
  europe depends on this industry . 
  so well put !, 
  that was such a moronic display of `` german angst '' ... 
  when an insanely strong and rare earth-quake causes a tsunami which destroys a single nuclear plant in japan , germany , a country with no earth-quakes and no tsunamis renounces all nuclear power . 
  i am , at heart , a federalist so these are not questions i spent any amount of time pondering . 
  and i am also , pro-immigration ; i would accept hundreds of thousands or millions of immigrants into romania , provided i have a say in picking and choosing them . 
  given recent ( the past 3-4 years , not just the refugee thing ) events , i think poland will pull v4 together like never before and try to influence eu politics from within . 
  i think the dream of a federal eu is gone and instead we 'll see little islands of unity , such as v4 , the baltic states and the balkan states in the east , where generally we will all enter orbit around warsaw because of similitude in foreign policy . 
  if we ca n't all feel european , and my german and austrian friends here treat me like 2nd class scum who can be denied schengen with impunity , the eu will stay afloat for as long as some money keeps flowing and only for as long as the benefits outweigh the drawbacks . 
  nobody will leave `` with us '' . 
  that implies that romania can be a leader of that magnitude , which it ca n't . 
  romania can set an example in things like , anti-corruption , but poland will lead if it comes to that . 
  * also not adding another country to schengen at the heigt of the refugee crisis seems very sensible . 
  * not complying to an idiotic immigration policy seems very sensible to me . 
  it 's not an * ad hominem * attack . 
  you are a hypocrite if you want to impose immigrant quotas out of solidarity with the schengen zone , while at the same time denying us schengen membership . 
  if we leave , we leave as a unified eastern block . 
  not as any one individual country . 
  you are wrongfully denying us schengen for the past 3 years you hypocrite . 
  i can not believe you have the audacity to lecture me on why i do n't need a right you enjoy and you wrongfully deny to me . 
  * from moving to germany and earning 7-8 times more * so keeping the periphery countries poor benefits german , austrian etc economy . 
  i get hung up on the money because the average wage in romania is 7 or 8 times less than germany while you are still allowed to export your products here , tax free . 
  and now you want to export immigrants forcefully too . 
  ** while you continue to block schengen for us ** . 
  you people are at the height of hypocrisy . 
  * other countries * , so not a federal state . 
  so i can say no to immigrants . 
  correct ? 
  federal state =  immigrant relocation , schengen and fiscal redistribution . 
  political union =  sovereignty and some measly funds . 
  that 's how this works . 
  i will never accept the disadvantages of a federal state , without the advantages . 
  fiscal redistribution or i 'll have none of this . 
  like i already said ; that is nowhere near enough to give up sovereignty over . 
  i expect to see fiscal redistribution before i even hear about any imposed immigrant quotas . 
  i do n't want to be part of any solution that fails to see that the purpose of borders is to stop people from crossing into our countries . 
  the entire purpose of having borders is precisely the same reason for having a fence around my property . 
  ** so we can pick and choose who we let in and who we keep out ** . 
  besides , the money you so arrogantly claim to find better purposes for , you would not have if the rest of the eu would not be buying your products . 
  so do n't pretend like you are some great benefactor or philanthropist . 
  the eu is sending a measly 3-4 bln euro / year to romania . 
  what the f is that ? 
  we could counter-balance that just by imposing an import tax on german goods and keep more of our own money in our country . 
  we are not a federal state and a lousy 3-4 bln / year is not fiscal redistribution ; certainly not enough for you to claim sovereignty over me . 
  i refuse to be part of her `` solution '' . 
  if she continues to impose her `` solution '' , i 'm going to vote for whichever party takes my country out of the eu . 
  what are you going to do about it ? 
  do you want the eu ? 
  then stop . 
  do you want to put an end to the eu ? 
  then continue . 
  but remember that when trade barriers and import / export taxes go up again , germany is going to be the main loser , by far . 
  are you going to call everyone east of berlin a racist for not willingly succumbing to your ridiculous immigration policy ? 
  so what if you do ? 
  calling someone a racist and expecting to impose a guilt-trip and auto-win any argument only works on westerners . 
  i do n't f !, 
  ! ~ #g care ; i want what is best for me and my country . 
  i want tolerant , easy to assimilate immigrants , and just like i can pick and choose who i let into my home , i will pick and choose who i let into my country . 
  it 's pretty stupid is n't it ? 
  all of this can be solved at sea and near the bulgarian , greek / turk border . 
  that 's where schengen broke , not between austria and slovenia . 
  what 's more , it 's fucking infuriating that `` cooperation and solidarity '' is imposed by merkel only in terms of `` sharing '' immigrant quotas , but not in protecting borders where it makes sense . 
  certainly , but a lot of us have to work too . 
  : \\ the way you linked your sources was not helpful at all . 
  the figure has been widely available since september . 
  perhaps if the mods around here reduced the amount of pro-refugee censorship we 'd get somewhere . 
  [ euro-f % ~ ! # & g-stat ] ( http://metro.co.uk/2015/09/19/eu-statisticians-claim-only-1-in-5-migrants-are-from-syria-5398412/ ) learn to google next time . 
  breath-taking hypocrisy . 
  that 20 % figure is official . 
  look it up . 
  i 'm not going to go through documents containing hundreds of pages to see what you 're on about . 
  it was the imf that lent money to eastern europe in 2009 . 
  that 's all i remember . 
  the idiot merkel is imposing the same medicine for patients with completely different conditions . 
  austerity might help spain and greece in the long term , but there is no reason to hold back romania and poland and bulgaria who need to borrow to return to 6-7 % yearly growth . 
  but i 'm not surprised because that b & !, 
  * h does n't care about income inequality and poverty and growth at the level of the eu . 
  if she did she would acknowledge that we have people living in extreme poverty in the eu . 
  and exempt helping them from the deficit first and foremost . 
  it 's quite disturbing . 
  so , austerity for european citizens is mandatory but it comes to providing welfare for others ( i repeat , only 20 % syrians ) , rules are overlooked . 
  the same austerity rules preventing countries like poland , romania to borrow money to develop faster . 
  i really hate this eu . 
  i hate merkel and juncker . 
  especially merkel could n't bend the rules even a little bit when it came to 20-27 % unemployment in spain and greece . 
  fuck that woman . 
  i am also a romanian start-up but we do n't provide any services which require high traffic ; it 's difficult to explain , but i trust our isp to offer us more than fair deals , no matter what our requirements are .

   and what you said does n't offer any sort of explanation of the complexity , it just relativizes the issue . 
  because i 'm sure most know how complex the situation is , they only need to be reminded at times to leave the bias and emotions beside . 
  people do n't really understand that what goes around , comes around . 
  yes it 's pretty easy on imposing sanctions on relatively isolated countries like nk or even iran . 
  but ukraine ? 
  in the middle of europe , and with huge borders to russia ? 
  you 're kidding right ? 
  you realise ukraine is right next to them and is very important ? 
  russia still has a very impressive and capable military , they are not able to project force on the globe , but right next to them they 'll do it better than anyone . 
  i ca n't believe it there are silly fucks pleading for a military intervention in europe . 
  we had enough wars and we know what happens if a situation gets very tense here , we 've been relatively peaceful for the last 60 years , you do n't want that to end !, 
  so what should happen if there are thousands of people who wo n't stop protesting , are ** lead by opposition ** and are protesting for something that another 50 % of the country are against . 
  this is more complex than you 're making it sound . 
  it 's a very good percent of growth , the 6 % growth was based mostly on services and consumption , and was generated by eu 's small boom . 
   then again , for fairness , occasionally we do make the right decision i guess . 
  i see some similarities to gps navigation ( which is much smaller in importance , of course , but still breathtakingly expensive infrastructure ) . 
  we all rely on the us owned gps system , knowing that it is completely within the us ' ability to downgrade the precision of the system if they ever deem it necessary . 
  took a few years , but galileo is now well on its way . 
  right now most newer gadgets also support glonass , so there 's more reliability behind finding out a position . 
  in just a couple of years , we 're going to have 4 satellite positioning systems , gps , glonass , galileo and compass , and then , beside the very increased reliability , controlling of entities over such abilities will be pretty small . 
  also , it 's worth noticing that it was a deliberately made famine , there was enough food produced here but a big chunk of it was going for exports . 
  and this started in late 70 's , i the late 60 's and early 70 's there was no such thing as shortages , in fact life was pretty good during that time . 
  is gagauzia receiving resources from moldova ? 
  might be just a case of `` hey , we 're still here and we 're still poor , help '' . 
  no , because the population is split in support . 
  interesting , thanks . 
  good signs as we 're getting less dependent on russian energy . 
  i see you are arguing that russia lacked a strong and consistent foreign policy because they used their energy supplier statute as leverage . 
  i argue that they use it just because they have a strong and consistent foreign policy , it was very predictable every time as it is their only powerful enough leverage , excluding military action ( which the russians are very reluctant to make use of ) . 
  can you also give ma a source on norway overtaking russia in 2013 , please ? 
  i 'm very interested in reading about it . 
  does it mean that europe/germany lacks a strong and consistent foreign policy when they leverage russia with investments ? 
  as in the short ruso-georgian war where europe threatened to cut down investments in russia . 
  in sco they lost no prestige , lost no partners , nothing . 
  it was just a statement , and they lacked a good enough context to make that statement , so had to do it there . 
  it was harmless , do n't get why you 'd think otherwise . 
  syria was no major purchaser of russian arms , as far as i remember they do n't account for even 10 % of total russian weapon sales . 
  that port in syria , is mostly a repair port , is small and does not have facilities to make for a good base . 
  i 'm assuming you mean that exposing troops in a war theater is a big cost to russia , i disagree and here 's the refutal : - opposition does not control most of the populated country , but actually quite few of it - areas where chemical weapons exist , are not in opposition controlled territory - opposition attacking chemical dismantle/transport troops would be a win for russia , it would play right in their game - if the opposition hates russia for supporting assad , we can assume the government hates western powers for supporting the opposition , and since the weapons are in government controlled territory and it 's not just russians but also western europeans who are in syria securing transfer of chemical weapons , then it 's a big cost for them . 
  the situation right now is very favorable to assad . 
  it 's impossible to win as in restore the country to 4 years ago , but instead win means having control over most of the important cities and populated areas . 
  and right now , for the past 6 months they are actively pushing opposition out of every strategic point . 
  i 'll agree with part of what you mean on syria . 
  but i 'll completely disagree on the part that it costs russia more . 
  no , it does n't and they do n't need syria that much , they do n't even care about assad , they just would n't want gulf states/american interests moving in so close . 
  it does n't cost them anything to remove those chemical weapons , and it provides them with much needed security needed in the actual context . 
  russia is way more scared of terrorists and chemical weapons than usa will ever be , because it 's russia who shares an enormous and impossible to secure border . 
  i do n't believe the americans have that much interest in syria either but they 've been pushed for it by their allies , it 's a game of saudi vs iran for regional power . 
  without russia having syria 's back , western/gulf states would 've installed a new system long ago , so the fact that assad is there and everything seems to predict the current system will win , it 's a huge blow for american interests , in the form of their allies/partners interests . 
  i view russia to be very predictable in how they act , extremely predictable . 
  what gives you the sentiment that russia is unpredictable is their game , which is different from what western powers or china is using . 
  russia always always acts on its own interest , even when not completely visible , and they are usually not sugar coating their strategy . 
  give me an example of russia foreign policy being short termed , or unpredictable . 
  for me it 's quite simple why they asked that in the sco and did n't even push too much for them . 
  they did n't care about getting it recognized , they just wanted to let the world know they intend on considering the two countries as sovereign and will protect their interests . 
  so you do n't see the purpose of russia going to sco and asking them to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia ? 
  i completely disagree , as from my point of view , and as all facts lead up , i see russia as probably the most cold blooded and calculated actor on the world politics scene , and their foreign policy has made enormous wins in the last years ( as syria 's case for example ) . 
  i disagree , russia 's foreign relations and diplomacy are extremely great , they are not emotional but very calculated to fit their plans . 
  if dealing with a smaller partner , their plans will most times not even take the partner into account . 
  however , in eu 's case , they could n't do that as they view eu as a powerful actor , capable of matching russia ( just like they view china and usa ) , and because they need the eu , regardless of their realpolitik games . 
  but that works both ways . 
  we ca n't piss them off then expect them to try and be friendly . 
  it matters way more than what italy 's napolitano says because : - russia is huge - russia 's a big military power - russia has a lot of geopolitical influence and leverage - russia has enormous resources everyone else needs, 
  why ? 
  it would be very advantageous for the eu and very disadvantageous for the euroasian union . 
  but since it 's the de facto leader of eurasian union wanting to do a trade zone , why would n't it work ? 
  that sounds tedious , they 're not going to be a vassal , give up the independence , sovereignty or autonomy of the country no matter their path . 
  although they will have to bend to regulations on both sides , eu or the euro-asia union . 
   many of them fucking worship that scumbag stalin my understanding is they only see him as a `` hero '' because its during his time ussr managed to win the war and survive ( it felt more like a battle of survival for them , rather than fighting nazi ideology or whatever , it 's why they call it the great patriotic war ) . 
  but they do n't worship him and he 's equally despised for all his deeds . 
  it 's worth noting that ukraine was the third nuclear power in the world in 1993 , they gave it to russia after russia and the usa signed a treaty that would guarantee ukraine 's integrity . 
  so the protesters are now demanding they sign the trade agreement with the eu and give the money back to russia ? 
  besides the foul language , we do n't even know what happened with those molotovs , since no protester has been hit by them . 
  there are cameras and photographs rolling 24/7 , and it would be fairly easy to hit someone with molotovs , considering how many people are in the square . 
  however , we have no proof anyone has been hit by a molotov , except for the riot police , whom we saw pictures of , being on fire . 
  same happened in romania . 
  but it 's worthy to note , that there are enough stupid people looking to provoke fights , even without them . 
  they may be , but unless eu steps up on their offer and gives ukraine money , leaving russia would be a suicide . 
  and that 's how it should be . 
  protecting institutions would n't make them side with anyone . 
  you know what ? 
   they genuinely hate people on the other side of the barricades . 
  this is really ... really scary . 
  it 's also very scary if protesters genuinely hate berkut/militias/authorities . 
  if more vital institutions get occupied , they might declare a state of emergency and have the army protect those buildings . 
  can you give us more details about spilna sprava ? 
  who are they ? 
  are they pro-government ? 
  do ukrainians believe this is a plot , in order to force the declaring of emergency state because of institutions are no longer able to do their duty ? 
  what are they trying to achieve by occupying and preventing the ministry of justice 's duty ? 
  would they be on the streets like that ? 
  would n't they be in high numbers first place and try to move in stealth not talking to everyone on the streets ? 
  it makes no sense for them to be russian troops , unless they were called in to guard on russian embassy or consulates . 
  and since there 's de facto control , i do n't know why we find this surprising . 
   i do n't think dividing the land in 2 would work , nor would any party accept that deal . 
  another interesting fact to keep in mind , is russia and the united states have signed treaties with ukraine to guarantee for the integrity of their country , in exchange of ukraine giving away their nuclear missile stockpile in 1993 . 
  back then ukraine was the world 's third nuclear power , as they inherited thousands of nuclear weapons from the ussr . 
  not respecting such high promises gives a clear case of what would happen when russia/us require other possible nuclear powers to give up their weapons . 
  well , at this time , there are -15 c in kiev . 
  if they start using water cannons on the crowds and get them soaked wet , they 're gon na get many sick or even killed .

  education is supposed to make you better , not filter out people who already know and are able from those who are not yet there . 
  i strongly disagree . 
  did the society go from agrarian to an industrial one ? 
  yes it did . 
  did the education system produce high quality intellectuals ? 
  good engineers ? 
  i would say no , it did not . 
  they did teach more things , but in a wrong way . 
  just rote memorization , conventional thinking , listening to authority . 
  that kind of thing . 
  education is in such a sad sad state precisely because of communism . 
  i 'd like for a bootloader capable of initializing the baseband processor for really basic call functions . 
  so that even if your os software is messed up , you are still able to have basic telephone functions . 
  you can far more easily mess up the bootloader than the bios . 
  also , your phone always boots from internal flash , i want to have the option to boot from a stick or from the internal sd card or whatnot . 
  a phone like that would not be easly brickable . 
  people would n't be that afraid to experiment . 
  i 'd send you a screenshot but i 'm on my laptop and it 's running windows so i feel like a traitor . 
  i 'd just like for somebody to strap a bios to a smartphone and allow me to install whatever shit i want without freaking out i might brick my unit . 
  well , maybe you should give it another try , because i installed ubuntu on my main computer for around 6 months and it 's been pretty smooth . 
  things have changed . 
  personally , i dislike android and what google is doing with it , but i do n't interact much with it so ... what do i know ... 
  i have literally never had a problem . 
  okay , once , when i configured my internet connection a pppoe and did n't know how to change it back . 
  but besides that , it runs pretty smooth . 
  i could plug linux on my pop 's computer and he would n't even know what 's up . 
  it works right out of the box and i did n't have to install any drivers for it . 
  maybe i 'm missing something , but ubuntu has become very stable and usable and i think maybe we 're stuck in the same mantra of `` hum dum , linux is hard '' that maybe was valid a couple of years ago , but not anymore . 
  in my oppinion , linux can be very stable , especially in the way corporations and the state are using it : putting it on pretty much the same hardware , with specialized software running on the units . 
  it is my opinion that is a good thing . 
  when you 're young , you go through college and do n't appreciate it as much as you would when you tried a couple of things in your life . 
  all my older college colleagues were far more interested in actually studying , more involved and i think learned more during college than their younger counterparts . 
  i think self-loathing is a hallmark of western societies . 
  that really does not help you get your point across . 
  are you talking about my post ? 
  and are you suggesting i 'm some kind of spd shill ? 
  if so , you 're sorely mistaken . 
  i 've been out these past 5 days in the street so i 'm totally against this shit they 're doing . 
  i just point out that we have to choose our battles . 
  we have to go out and be loud when we are sure of the negative effects . 
  else , if we go out and protest unknowingly , we open ourselves to valid criticism of not knowing what we stand for . 
  i find a good analogy for this fight with boxing . 
  spd went and pushed and commited too much to one attack and lost their balance . 
  we countered , and now they 're retreating , their balance is on the back leg . 
  to give a ko , we do n't have to loose our balance but to strike fast powerful punches in combination , but aware of every opening in their guard , and making sure of not lowering ours . 
  after all , this might be just a feint . 
  i would n't go nuts about it yet . 
  the parlament law might be reasonable , clarifying the abuse law was asked by the ccr and they 'll have to do it eventually , and i 'm sure that if they want to , they 're able to make a decent , clear , functional law that does n't hamper the anti-corruption fight . 
  or maybe i 'm just optimistic , but i refrain for saying anything untill i see the proposed text . 
  apparently , a startup fund aimed at small and medium firms , with governmental money had been decreed through oug . 
  this fund has the nice , round sum of 200 000 ron per business . 
  while i 'm all for supporting new businesses , this sounds incredibly fishy . 
  more discussion here : https://www.reddit.com/r/romania/comments/5rtsrh/coincidenta/ i do n't know what to say about this , it 's just a theory at this point but it kinda ' fits . 
  we 're getting ridiculous calls from fake-news media for prosecuting the chief prosecutor . 
  i think the action of the chief prosecutor is the most surprising , but they unearthed some legislation that apparently lets them suspend the effect of the ordinance , buying us more time . 
  i do n't know the status of that , and frankly i find it hard to understand all the legal mumbo-jumbo , but i 'm surprised it is n't more talked about . 
   suggesting that this is tyranny of majority . 
  i did not suggest such a thing , i just pointed out that the majority is not always right . 
  i did mention tha irrelevant if you agree with the tyranny of the majority theory or not , this is not the case here . 
  the majority simply does not want this oug to pass . 
  the govt . 
  knows that , that 's why they refused to listen and wait to the referendum the elected president wanted and when and gave legislation hiding , in the night . 
   anyway , regardless of this outlook , whether you or i am wrong , that is not the case here , this decission is against even a big part of their own electorate . 
   sure , we 're not oppressed , we just see the fruits of our labor wasted . 
  and i did not try pushing that argument for this particular case , i was just pointing out that the majority might not always be right . 
  actually , as you can see above , i conceded that this is nto the case here . 
   you are essentially suffering from severe cognitive dissonance , because the political outcome is the opposite of what you want , but also a direct outcome of system of democratic republic , something you clearly view as a net positive . 
  so you start looking for a scapegoat . 
  maybe i am suffering from congnitive dissonance . 
  but that is largely irrelevant because i think lovers of democracy do n't suggest for elected officials , once they won , to go against the will of the same people that voted them . 
   what you and many others in this thread arrived at is a fairly common mass hallucination . 
  we recently observed the same factor on brexit in uk and trump 's election in us from people opposing those . 
  fact is , that this is indeed nothing but a hallucination . 
  when you participate in a democratic process and lose , you are expected to accept the result . 
  not doing so is patently undemocratic , and paints you as nothing but a sore loser who can not accept his loss . 
   to summarize : yes , you can in fact ignore the minority in the country when it comes to deciding policy , even if its a large minority on policy , as long as democratic process was respected in arriving to said policy . 
  that is how democratic republics govern , and this is by design . 
  i see this as a fetishization of democracy . 
  democracy works simply because everybody gets something out of it . 
  you might not agree with all that passes , but overall , you 're pretty ok with it or at least , not too disturbed . 
  when that breaks down and a large swath of population does not get anything in return , the state begins to break down since participating in that democracy is nor advantageous for the individual . 
  so yes , i do assert that in a democracy you need to keep the overwelming majority happy in order for it to be able to function as a democracy . 
  and even if it were not so , even if i were wrong , if a democracy hooses something that you are fermly convinced is wrong and will produce much suffering and sorrow , should you sit back , say that 's what the people voted and watch the horror show unfold ? 
  i think not , blindly accepting what is happening is not how people got to where they are and you can not force me to accept something i disagree on a basic level . 
  if i am to be forced to do something the majority wants you fight , leave or secede . 
  and this is what it might end up at . 
  what is the absurd hyperbole , mind you ? 
  i saw the discussion we were having as 2 disjunct issues : 1 ) that the majority can/can ' t decide for the minority indifferent of what they decide or how much the minority is bothered 2 ) that my country has the majority of people against this oug . 
  what the hyperbole regarding pct1 or pct2 ? 
  sory for my musings regarding the rest , but they were more my reflections rather than trying to convince you of anything . 
   and no , the entire point of winning the democratic mandate to governance is that you do not have to cede anything to the loser . 
  you won , they lost . 
  you get to set the policy . 
  if your policy is acceptable to electorate , you 'll win the next elections . 
  if it is n't , opponents will win and it 's their turn to do the same . 
  that is totally not true , you have to find a middle way so all the country is represented and happy . 
  if 45 % of the population is underrepresented , you 've got a revolution on your hands . 
  you ca n't ignore the rest of the country , even if they did not vote for you , they are still your friggin ' country !, 
  you need only 3.5 % of the population to go to the streets to have a revolution on your hand . 
  chanting `` 55 % voted for me ! '',

  in july 1996 , the u.s. secretary of defense declared , `` i can not overestimate the importance of ukraine as an independent country to the security and stability of all of europe , ''  [ ... ]  most important , however , is ukraine . 
  as the eu and nato expand , ukraine will eventually be in the position to choose whether it wishes to be part of either organization . 
  it is likely that , in order to reinforce its separate status , ukraine will wish to join both , once they border upon it and once its own internal transformation begins to qualify it for membership . 
  although that will take time , it is not too early for the west -- while further enhancing its economic and security ties with kiev -- to begin pointing to the decade ** 2005-2015 ** as a reasonable time frame for the ** initiation of ukraine 's progressive inclusion ** , thereby reducing the risk that the ukrainians may fear that europe 's expansion will halt on the polish-ukrainian border . 
    russia , despite its protestations , is likely to acquiesce in the expansion of nato in 1999 to include several central european countries , because the cultural and social gap between russia and central europe has widened so much since the fall of communism . 
  by contrast , russia will find it ** incomparably harder to acquiesce in ukraine 's accession to nato ** , for to do so would be to acknowledge that ukraine 's destiny is no longer organically linked to russia 's .

  that sounds like a joke that swedes tell . 
  there are so many of them because they have no predator . 
  no local hunters complaining about how the wolves are eating the roe deers ? 
  yes , i know about this . 
  but just because some europeans did nasty things to your ancestors does n't justify you doing nasty things to the palestinians . 
   without clearing all hurdles with local authorities the israelis almost never allow any construction works to be done by the palestinians in the occupied territories . 
   i do n't know a single country that would react kindly to an unlicensed foreign backed construction without permits in area under its jurisdiction . 
  do you know a single country where the majority of the population does n't have voting rights ? 
  it 's not even very leftist , it 's a liberal newspaper , similar to the new york times . 
   the amount of antisemitism in this thread is insane . 
  being against israel 's policies towards the palestinians is not equal to antisemitism . 
  i know it 's the official policy of israel to lump these together , but that 's wrong and i think most people here agree with this . 
  it 's obvious that due to the occupation the palestinians are not master of their own destiny . 
  there are only two obvious solutions : * you either give israeli citizenship and voting rights to all palestinians ( one-state solution ) * you give full independence to the palestinian territories ( two-state solution ) as long as neither of these is implemented , it 's an apartheid state . 
  of course , it was not never `` communist '' at all either . 
  some socialists argue that soviet-style socialism is not even socialism because the workers had very little to no control over the means of production , using `` state capitalism '' instead . 
   i thought this was standard in any european country . 
  the only place in the eu where i 've seen a warning in a hotel not to drink the tap water was in malta . 
  and the only place where i 've seen in a hotel a sign which encouraged me to drink the tap water was in denmark . 
  it reformed into a hybrid . 
  the state has huge influence everywhere in the economy . 
  china was communist , but it reformed gradually . 
   it was n't china that did that , it was massive western investment . 
  most investment in mainland china was never from the us or europe , but from asia , especially taiwan , hong kong , singapore , south korea , japan , etc. 
  for example , the largest private employer in china ( foxconn , 1.3 million employees ) is taiwanese . 
  i have a co-worker from \u00c5lesund who is wearing skinny jeans . 
  that 's not really outdated , that 's just wrong . 
   stop putinbotting . 
  yeah , because it 's not possible to have a different opinion without being a putin bot . 
  also , the huge cost to find and train workers and technicians who work on that factory . 
  yes . 
   they can give lots of benefits to women with more kids now , but they do n't . 
  they closed down many public kindergardens in the country and the private sector replaced them with expensive ones . 
  in the countryside , there are virtually no kindergardens at all . 
  they were all closed down after 1989 . 
  there is no tax incentive to have kids , we have a flat tax system . 
  ( at least now it 's a flat tax , until a year ago , we had a regressive tax system : the higher the wage , the lower the percentage due to a cap on social security contributions ) . 
   choose one . 
  you can argue that `` climate change '' is false , but there 's no one questioning that particulate matter is very bad for health . 
  the us and uk have a history of overthrowing democratic governments and replacing them with dictatorships . 
  english got some names of italian cities from the local dialects rather than from standard italian . 
  for instance , `` milan '' is the name of the city in milanese . 
   why would that person do that when he/she can earn more than that amount in romania ? 
  short story : no , they ca n't earn more than that in romania . 
  the minimum wage in romania is 230 $ ( after taxes ) . 
  but these jobs are often not in the areas where the unemployed people live . 
  they 'd have to move to bucharest or cluj or some other city where the jobs are . 
  in the cities the costs are high and they need to rent an apartment . 
  it 's hard to afford that out of that minimum wage . 
  the legislation is generally a very bad deal for workers , a great deal for business owners . 
  for instance , the minimum wage is 7 $ / month . 
  based on the regressive measures they 've implemented , i expect them to consider restoring feudalism as well . 
  why off ? 
  are the `` poor '' too many ? 
  i 'd argue not . 
  first of all , all the subsistence farmers are poor ( poorer than the minimum wage employees ) , no question about it . 
  then , the ( mostly urban ) minimum wage employees are poor , barely making enough to pay rent or mortgage . 
  this is half of the employees . 
  but also people who make above the minimum wage are poor , especially those living in high-cost cities like bucharest or cluj . 
  you have to take into consideration that in romania , a 500 $ / month gross wage would make you among the top 10 % . 
   the psd seem to be to be a horribly inept and corrupt party correct . 
  the problem is that we do n't have an alternative . 
  the main two opposition parties : * liberals are slightly less corrupt ( that does n't mean they 're not also horribly corrupt , but they 're more inept in organizing it ) , but they make up by being even more inept in general . 
  * save romania union is a protest party against corruption . 
  however , they do n't have a ideology , having members varying from hard-left socialists to us-style libertarians , from religious conservatives to progressists . 
  as expected , they spend most of the time in-fighting . 
  they spent the last month arguing internally ( with a lot of drama ) over gay marriage . 
   macron in france proved something its that maybe it 'd be possible to capture the reformist energy that 's not possible in romania because we do n't have a big middle class . 
  romania basically has : * 0.1 % very very rich . 
  * 10 % european-level middle class ( almost all of it in bucharest and a few more cities like cluj and timi\u0219oara ) * 90 % poor the poor are not going to vote for economic liberalism anymore . 
  they know that more austerity is going to lower their standard of living . 
  the opposition had virtually all the press against them . 
   all other following actions , such as genocides and ethnic cleansing , are equally only the chosen preferred method of some of them to achieve that the extermination of `` inferior '' races and taking up their lands ( `` lebensraum '' ) are a central part of nazism . 
   marx was very clear about the essence of what the `` dictatorship of the proletariat '' would be and it fully entitled violence , on a huge scale , against the `` enemy social classes '' . 
  marxism is absolutely inherently violent and genocidal by definition . 
  really ? 
  if you are such an expert in marxism , i 'm sure you can give me a quotation of marx in which he says you need to exterminate/do genocide on the `` enemy social classes '' . 
  try to convince meps to outlaw some of the parties that are part of the european parliament ? 
  very democratic , indeed . 
  of course far-left is the same as the far right . 
  the far left wants more economic and social equality , the far right wants to exterminate a part of the people . 
  same thing . 
  i thought sweden must be destroyed and norway must be conquered . 
  actually , his slogan is that he 's strong and not entirely stable ... 
   switzerland wanted its own atomic bomb so did ceau\u0219escu 's romania . 
   a hatred for communists is n't the communist party the 3rd largest party in the czech parliament , after the social-democrats and the liberals of ano 2011 ? 
  of course , it 's a joke on the masked racism of the conservatives . 
  i 'd rather vote for mr. bean than for darth vader .

   russia has , since the war , occupied abkhazia and south ossetia in violation of the ceasefire agreement of august 2008 . 
   i wish all my arguments could be solved by spamming one link en masse . 
  calling it spam is a great way to ignore it . 
   the us has one of the biggest bases in the world in kosovo for a reason as well . 
  yeah , but they did n't effectively annex the territory and they did n't start an ethnic cleansing campaign against the locals . 
   the population of abkhazia was reduced to 216,000 after an ethnic cleansing of georgians , a decrease from 525,000 before the war . 
   not sure what game we 're playing ? 
  the game where we pretend that war did n't happen ? 
  because that 's stupid . 
  you 're laying the game of `` georgia tried to take back '' , which never actually happened . 
   by 1 august 2008 , ossetian separatists began shelling georgian villages , with a sporadic response from georgian peacekeepers in the region . 
  to put an end to these deadly attacks and restore order , the georgian army was sent to the south ossetian conflict zone on 7 august . 
  georgians took control of most of tskhinvali , a separatist stronghold , in hours . 
  georgia later stated it was also responding to russia moving non-peacekeeping units into the country . 
  tskhinvali was and still is georgian territory . 
  georgia responded to russian separatists that attacked georgian villages . 
  that 's how the war started . 
   russia accused georgia of `` aggression against south ossetia '' , while ignoring how their own separatists started the conflict in the first place  and launched a large-scale land , air and sea invasion of georgia on 8 august with the stated aim of `` peace enforcement '' operation . 
  even though their aim was `` peace enforcement '' , russia effectively annexed 20 % of georgian territory . 
  why ? 
  why not ? 
   russian forces temporarily occupied the georgian cities of zugdidi , senaki , poti , and gori , holding on to these areas beyond the ceasefire . 
  the south ossetians destroyed most ethnic georgian villages in south ossetia and were responsible for an ethnic cleansing of georgians . 
  russia recognised the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia from georgia on 26 august  the population of abkhazia was reduced to 216,000 after an ethnic cleansing of georgians , a decrease from 525,000 before the war . 
  ethnic cleansing ? 
  is just `` peace enforcement '' .

  you 're cherry picking your arguments while ignoring everything else that does n't suit your agenda .

   because georgia tried to take it back ? 
  did they ? 
  i do n't recall any georgian military operation that tried to do this . 
  and even if they did , it 's still their territory . 
  what actually happened was  in 2009 , georgian president mikheil saakashvili mentioned in several addresses the fact that russia was staying 40 kilometers away from georgia 's capital , tbilisi , and aimed weapons at it . 
  and  in march 2011 , the russians demanded village aibga , situated on the psou river in the northwest part of abkhazia , to be transferred to russia .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_finsbury_park_attack  on 19 june 2017 , a van was driven into pedestrians in finsbury park , london , injuring at least eight people . 
  this occurred near the muslim welfare house , 100 yards ( 90 m ) from finsbury park mosque . 
  a man who had earlier collapsed and was receiving first aid died at the scene . 
   a group of muslims had earlier performed tarawih , night time prayers held in the month of ramadan , when they came across a collapsed man at a bus stop . 
  ** while rendering first aid they were rammed , and ten were injured . 
  ** the collapsed man , makram ali , died at the scene , and post-mortem findings indicated that he died of multiple injuries . 
   russia , naturally , saw putin 's abkhazian visit -- his first in four years -- somewhat differently . 
  `` the most important thing is that we have very special relations with abkhazia . 
  we safeguard the security and independence of abkhazia . 
  i am confident this will continue into the future , '' putin said . 
  he also noted that the russian military group deployed there is `` developing well . '' why is russia safeguarding `` the security and independence of abkhazia '' ? 
  because  the russian military group deployed there is `` developing well . '', 
  fear and ignorance happens . 
  and fear leads to hate which leads to violence . 
   hit and runs are usually accidents except when they are n't . 
   and in many cases the drivers are unknown just like in this case . 
   theres are coverup of widespread antiislamic hit and runs and yet people still blame muslims . 
   theres like 30 times more `` white people '' than muslims and yet probably at least that many times more muslim attackers than vice versa . 
  the disparity is even greater comparing body counts .

   the armenian genocide could have happened to us . 
  ( ignoring the modern context of the genocide in question ) did the equivalent of the armenian genocide happen to bulgaria ? 
  they were under direct turkish control . 
  actually , it was more profitable to the turks to just keep us as we were , then to turn us into an elayet ( pasalac ) . 
  sure , we had a few decent statesmen during the centuries , either in moldova or wallachia , but even the great ones realized that there is no real chance for independence . 
  plus , if you went rogue , after the turks came to set you straight , you had to pay tribute retroactively for the years of `` missbehaviour '' .

   and what on earth do you mean by   the preservation of the language , both for them and for us , happened on its own up until the 19th century that there was no conscious effort to preserve the language . 
  it just got preserved . 
  sure , mothers teach their children their language , but there was no pan-romanian movement to not speak something else . 
  it was simply what mother so . 
  they do it anywhere else . 
   so , what 's i 'm talking about is an achievement by the romanian people , done over centuries , passively or at least without a leader taking a decision to do this . 
  exactly . 
  there is no `` achievement '' when there is no intent . 
  it 's like being proud that you managed to grow tall . 
   now , french went far away from latin while romanian stayed close to it . 
  it stayed close in some aspects , and `` went away '' in others . 
   i 'm no expert in finno-ugric languages , but it 's not like hungarians can just walk into a bakery in tallinn and ask for a loaf of bread in hungarian and expect to get it . 
  those cultural influences actually count ... 
  this is totally irrelevant to the point . 
  also , fyi , hungarian and estonian are from separate branches of the finno-ugric family . 
  talking hungarian in estonia is like talking romanian in iran . 
  also , do you think the lithuanians should be proud of the fact that the lithuanian language stayed close to its proto-indo-european roots ? 
  do you think germans should be ashamed their language diverged ?

   also , regarding tuscany in particular , we were the first country in history to abolish death penalty in 1786 . 
  we still celebrate the 30th of november , the day that law was issued , as a holiday here in tuscany . 
  how very cool !, 
   actually we did n't stay latin , we were culturally close to the bulgarian empire , the greek orthodox church and the ottoman empire . 
  we stayed latin linguistically , but not culturally . 
  problem is , romanian thought pretty much equates culture with language , because our linguistic exceptionalism is what we built our national narrative around . 
   but i recently enjoyed reading why is romania different , and i highly recommend it . 
  i actually found the book weaker than his earlier writings . 
   the basques rule in this area i meant it in their area  the hungarians did run ( co-run ) an empire , so they were rarely under the threat of having another culture being imposed on them , quite the opposite . 
  this is a very selective reading of hungarian history ( which is understandable , as romanian historiography tends to emphasize the moments of hungarian strength ) . 
  from the early 16th to the late 18th they did not run or co-run anything and were dominated culturally by turks ( quite directly in what is now hungary ) and austrians . 
  anyway , my point was that the fact that hungarians are just as far from their linguistic kin . 
  also , the preservation of the language , both for them and for us , happened on its own up until the 19th century , so i would n't actually call it an achievement . 
   to weaken hungary first of all . 
  i 'd really like a source on this . 
  i do n't think this is the whole picture tbh . 
  well , it 's true for the hungarians and basques as well then . 
  yeah , but the distribution differs . 
  while slovakia 's hungarians are in a narrow , compact strip right on the border , at least half of romania 's hungarians are inside an enclave in the middle of the country . 
  there are also smaller inland areas in transylvania where hungarians are mixed with romanians ( like cluj county ) . 
  your area could easily have been included in hungary but were not . 
  it does n't seem to have been included in slovakia because of the ethnicity of the inhabitants on ethnic grounds . 
  so i wonder what the rationale was behind it was . 
  agreed . 
  the fact that we made it into the eu as early as we did . 
  i 'd say our ethnic relations are good , and , even with all the flag waving and whatnot , we 're still one of the countries with most significant rights afforded to minorities . 
  also , i 'd say the whole 1850s-to-1920s was a good period ( on the whole , not especially good for the poor peasants ) . 
  we united the romanian speaking regions , starting with alexandru ioan cuza 's sneaky [ union of wallachia and moldavia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_principalities ) to the post wwi union . 
  also , we freed the gypsies from slavery , which is always a plus . 
  also us staying out of 1968 invasion of czechoslovakia is something nice imo . 
  not to mention that with all the internal bad , ceasescu did manage to keep a nice balanced foreign policy . 
  also , our internet rocks !,

   but this was probably less than 10 % of the territory . 
  sure . 
  i 'm not questioning the overall idea of the treaty . 
  i think a lot of people feel that it was unfair even in the context of loosing territory .

   one of these regions would contain szekeler land in its entirety . 
  local autonomy would be gained , not lost . 
  iirc the most favoured version of the reform would be using the current development regions . 
  under that scheme , szeklerland would be swallowed up in region center , and hungarians would make up only 30 % of said region , so they could still be outvoted in the regional assembly by the romanian parties ( which they obviously do not want ) . 
  they are making a fuss because they want szeklerland to be its own region . 
   it 's not higher than 15-20 % went to the countryside this weekend .

  the issue , as we have learned , is that you 're not just dealing with the uk government but also the uk media . 
  admittedly , i 'm operating from the assumption that ireland will not accept having either it 's immigration or customs regulations tied to the uk and wo n't impose checks on eu travel and trade . 
  and the uk refusing to implement both on travel and trade restrictions to and from northern ireland . 
  i might be wrong . 
  but if i 'm not , then it 's only a matter of time before public outrage over either immigration or smuggling forces the uk government 's hand . 
  it hits too close to home in regard to why it left the eu in the first place . 
  if it happens during negotiations or after , i could n't say . 
  because it properly sources and fact checks its reporting . 
  or it so it used to . 
  that is not a report , it 's a wishlist . 
  things have changed since the common travel area was put in place .

  so good luck , but do n't be dissapointed . 
  heh , really ? 
  you think between customs and people , it will all be dandy ? 
  you 'll just use `` cooperation '' and everything will be fine ? 
  no mention of different migration policies , or alcohol/tobacco smuggling need be made ? 
  i am afraid we 'll just have to continue this conversation when the thread `` sun puts blacks and tans on front page as warning to ireland '' is posted .

  honestly , if this was the main argument instead of `` no muslims '' we could have reformed it into something workable a year ago . 
  unfortunatly everyone 's trapped in their respective echo chambers . 
  remember as well that the uk was once the largest borrower from the imf , and now a fervent supporter . 
  it should be intimately familiar with all those points as they are also imf policy , having both reformed under them and imposed them on others .

  the eu spokesman has actually come out today saying he has no comment over anything hungary has been saying or doing . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.politico.eu/blogs/playbook-plus/2017/04/today-at-commission-that-man-orban-again/ ), 
  this has happened 7 times already this year , 600 times in the last 4 . 
  and both sides have been catching each other 's ships for decades , with no escalation . 
  i get it , you want to get with what all the cool kids are doing these days . 
  rattle some sabers , maybe talk of argies or krauts . 
  but how about you sit down and have a breather . 
  eu position coming from uk media . 
  i do n't have enough salt to take with this right now . 
  i 'm going to go ahead for a reliable news source to cover it , if not the actual eu statement . 
   we are slow to quarrel 2 days . 
  that 's the time between gibraltar being mentioned once , and talk of war . 
  you might be narrowly loosing to north korea . 
  you can do better !, 
  and this is only the beginning . 
  this has been happening for decades on a monthly basis , as both sides have ships stray into each other 's waters , now it will make front page news every time until `` somebody does something about it '' . 
  it 'll be the cod wars all over again . 
  except , considering the fisheries issue , we might also see another cod wars . 
  cynical point of view : tusk is the strongest possible opponent of the current government in the future . 
  if he comes back to lead po it might put pis out of a job . 
  any personal or national dramas are constructed purely to prevent that from happening , and so keep pis in power . 
  it would piss them off so much . 
   it 's a great idea !, 
  dont feed the troll . 
  those french weapons are made by companies employing european workers and contractors . 
  including from romania and finland . 
  how is that a criticism ? 
  why single george out ? 
  george iii was a bit of a weird duck , his treatment of his german herritage included . 
  but for his predecesors and succesors , until the 20th german as a first language and mentions of an accent were common. , victoria included . 
  either way it puts into doubt that the queen 's english was actually the exact english the queen spoke . 
  edit : rechecked , victorias first language was german that is known as a matter of record . 
  there are mentions of a german accent to her english . 
  george the 3rd was more of an oddball than the beginning of a trend . 
  right , the almost genetic hatred that most the population manages to do without . 
  seriously i do n't know what worse , your admission to irrational hatred or your appreciation of someone who 's been feeding that irational hatred to win votes . 
  joaana , be honest , are you jacob rees-mogg ? 
  our niue is turkey .

  the problem here is the problem of all governments and especially democracies : if the experts warn , and the people do n't care , then politicians would do nothing . 
  no one ever got a medal for preventing a disaster from happening . 
  and the counter is that `` representatives are supposed to follow their constituencies wishes no matter their personal opinion '' . 
  i 've been down that road , learned not to go into politics . 
  atleast not as a politician . 
  i was actually also partially inspired by how russia has been making inroads in europe . 
  their diplomats go to what can be considered `` right wing '' events , gun shows , war memorabilia sales and find the right kind of people to serve as contacts for organizations such as jobbik in hungary . 
  so i was thinking less about `` propaganda '' like behaviour , despite the cold war proving it 's effectiveness , and a more corporate style . 
  sponsor events with the right people , create european scolarships and schools , poach promising talent for the diplomatic core , fly high ranking politicians to exotic locals , even fund `` europeanized '' local media productions . 
  you know , the shit companies do to get ahead in a market where `` who you know '' determines what gets done , and the brand you have is what opens doors . 
  do n't . 
  this is going great , and we do n't need anyone sobering up . 
  he apparently died while in the hospital , having been rushed off in december . 
  that 's why article says `` died while serving prison sentence '' , rather than giving a location . 
  `` i do n't need the union to negotiate my salary and work benefits . '', 
  `` i do n't need the trade group to talk to politicians . '', 
  `` i do n't need the party to run for election . '', 
  and now : `` i do n't need the political union to negotiate a trade deal . '', 
  no you do n't , but do n't be surprised at the results . 
  i 've just described a large scale variant of a multi-billion euro sector knows as : public relations . 
  everything i said is part of university curriculums : branding , networking , pull-factors . 
  you 've confused a lack of lateral thinking for a sort of simple-minded sobriety . 
  suit yourself . 
  france and uk , really . 
  the us was dragged into it , ironically . 
  and i say we , because france is one of us . 
  their failures become our problems , as we have seen . 
  someone asked me a damn question , and i tried to answer . 
  and what did you expect ? 
  `` average joe '' diplomatic relations 101 text book material ? 
  some safe-bet unimaginative `` i guess we can all get around a table and hash it out '' , or the polar opposite conservative `` flex our muscles '' routine ? 
  since when is having picked up a history book equated with playing video games ? 
  let 's not discuss assistance but interest . 
  did we know what and who the rebellion was ? 
  were there british , french or italian agents giving reports on what we were to expect ? 
  did we , in short , have a clue ? 
  evidence suggests that no one did . 
  we 've seen as much in syria as well . 
  we might have to accept a darker truth that not only are our hands tied in the surrounding region , but that we have no idea what is actually happening . 
  we 're playing international relations like a game of telephone . 
  i 've come to suspect as much from the saudi-iran proxy war , and their mutual bafflement at the european diplomats `` not getting it '' and talking about migration numbers like it was an issue they were supposed to care about . 
  well , there 's 3 questions in that really : 1 . 
  did we improve the situation by doing what we did ? 
  could we have done what we did better ? 
  was there something we could have done much earlier that could have given us better results ? 
  we ca n't rest all the blame on one single moment , when there are systematic faults to be found and fixed . 
  windows of opportunity missed . 
  and the end result is clearly complete failure , i hope that does n't deserve discussion . 
  arguing `` could have been worse '' is pointless , it can always be worse . 
  what 100 % did n't work is last-minute police actions through air bombings . 
  the country split into factions , violence spread to mali , the resulting instability lead to large migration which increases instability even more due to the nature of transient populations , economic impacts likely felt in the entire region , so on and so forth . 
  waste of time and money , nothing to show for it . 
  what can i , as a foreign individual , do to help call this rose by whatever name the polish government wants , and put the damn thing to rest already so they can focus on running the damn country ? 
  i wish i was smart enough to give something truly concrete and useful . 
  but , all i can offer is that we should engage in outright and unashamed cultural warfare , because it historically has worked . 
  it 's `` soft touch '' , for an age where we think gdp is a measure of power , but it 's what kept china 's tributary system working , what softened roman expansion , and what exploded from post-revolutionary france . 
  some could argue that it 's what russia is doing right now . 
  and with that cultural gravity draw in important figures , political and economic , inside european circles . 
  give the ones we like support , give the one 's we do n't like enough rope to hang themselves on , and just constantly have their ear . 
  be what versailles was to the french nobility , a prison from which they do n't want to escape . 
  this is n't happy families , this is geopolitics . 
  pragmatism takes precedence , and it 's as cold as steel to skin . 
  there 's plenty of media gagging to tell y' all how great things will be , find your consolation there . 
   you say ` we ' as if romania contributes to anything . 
  you got more to offer than derision and insults ? 
  flag got you triggered ? 
  can we please stop lending support to this `` punishment narrative '' . 
  the uk wanted to play the `` self-interest comes first '' game , and we 're playing it . 
  their attachment to the `` win-win '' delusion is theirs , not ours . 
  and likely a tactic to pad out their weak position . 
  this is an adversarial political culture , they know when they 're on the back foot . 
  how about : not our problem . 
  the economic well being of the uk is no longer in our purview . 
  it 's their country , they can run it in the gutter and we have no duty to pull them back . 
  not bending backwards for idiots is not some strange form of punishment we all invented . 
  deal with it . 
  that being said , you 've been posting a self-post on this topic nearly every day now . 
  i think you 're trying to make it a thing . 
  it 's not going to be a thing . 
  we are not the uk 's parents . 
  but then we have libya , and look how badly that went . 
  the italians are pretty much alone cleaning it up . 
  while i appreciate french military command , their foreign policy is to much `` have hammer , see nails '' . 
  we need something more clever to bind the countries of the mare nostrum to us and keep them ticking . 
  well that 's the thing , you either defend the border in the balkans , or you defend them next door after every transit country moved them your way , since it 's not like serbia or turkey were in schengen . . 
  either way you 're defending the border , so what kind of person says : i prefer that we take care of this problem at the very last minute and as close to our homes as possible ,, 
  you really did n't pay attention to what merkel was doing in 2012 were you ? 
  she does n't have `` views '' , she has polls . 
  here 's a clue of how to see merkel : she 's like orban , except for germans . 
  tell me , what do you think you 're getting voting for the cdu ? 
  pretty sure , they were satisfied with an email containing my lease copy . 
  be sure to carry proof of address as well . 
  got asked for it last time . 
  alexandru ioan cuza was forced to resign because he did n't give the nobility everything they wanted , and actually tried to do what was best for the people . 
  so they slandered him , ran him out of the country , and replaced him with a tame german prince . 
  probably the only good man to lead romania , well , maybe until now . 
   why do you assume that a left coalition would somehow ruin our economy ? 
  i 'm not even german and i do n't get what he 's babbling about . 
  the hartz reforms that helped propel germany out of `` sick man of europe '' status to economic beast , and which merkel has been living off the past decade happened under an spd/gr \u00fcne coalition . 
  same in new zealand .

  hey , 3 strikes here we come . 
  i think it 's a bad idea to unite telecoms , but mr. almunia has it right : `` mr almunia has taken a tough stance against national mergers ... he has indicated more openness to cross-border tie-ups that would help build a single eu market , generate cross-border services and drive digital investment . '', 
  isps should connect their networks so speed and latency between countries is better , but that 's about all i 'd personally like . 
  eu should make downloading for personal use legal too . 
  he is right about the west taking political correctness way too seriously though . 
  especially america . 
  yeah sure i want them . 
  i 'd like to see every european country in the eu eventually . 
  it does n't make sense . 
  the article says they 'll lose out on 12 million euros ... that 's a lot of money to lose , out of good will . 
  but i guess if they can afford it then it 's good , i would n't mind it happening here too but only if they could sustain themselves somehow . 
  well if they have proof against them , then go for it . 
  i wonder what will be the outcome , but i wo n't be surprised if the `` church '' gets away without punishment . 
  as someone who has been to both private and public hospitals/clinics in oradea , i can vouch for you . 
  i also know people who chose to go to hungary , most of them couples , to give birth . 
  the beds and rooms are pretty clean in hospitals imo , ca n't say that about the toilets , but it 's a certainty that you have to buy your own medications or disposable tools like syringes . 
  it 's the same pretty much in the whole partium region of romania . 
  but they can still block stuff if they want . 
  it 's a move in the right direction though . 
  so what are we seeing there ? 
  in hungarian : ( linking google translate for pronounciations ) - american : [ amcsi ] ( http://translate.google.com/#auto/en/amcsi ) - japanese : jap\u00f3 or japcsi - russian : [ ruszki ] ( http://translate.google.com/#hu/en/ruszki ) somewhat offensive ones : - blacks : feka ( pl . 
  [ fek\u00e1k ] ( http://translate.google.com/#hu/en/fek%c3%a1k ) ) from fekete , meaning black - romanian : [ ol\u00e1h ] ( http://translate.google.com/#hu/en/ol%c3%a1h ) ( historically correct term , but usually used in a derogatory way in casual language , the romanian equivalent against hungarians would probably be [ bozgor ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bozgor ) ) - german : fritz ( probably offensive , i would n't use in front of germans ) as for romanian nicknames , i dunno . 
  i 'm not a native speaker so i just call everyone the normal way . 
  i 'm pretty sure using a canoe on the danube is not a good idea . 
  i was one of the uninformed . 
  did n't know the eu as a whole was against it . 
  i was sure that western european countries would n't be signing , but i was n't sure about romania . 
  in this country anything can happen . 
  what about the mafia , triad etc. 
  true , true ... look at the brouhaha it caused and is causing in france . 
  good , while i personally did n't even try to get into the program , i think it 's a really good idea that is worth keeping . 
  i 'm happy they did n't end up scraping it . 
  i 'm proud of the eu for standing up against this bs . 
  to be frank i was slightly scared things will go the wrong way , but in the end freedom prevailed . 
  i love europe . 
  that 's just what we need . 
  my mum is a heavy smoker , nothing they can find in / r/wtf will change her mind about it , i tried convincing her . 
  romania already has these grotesque pics on packages , but not as big as the aussies ( and i see uk has them too ) . 
  even though i 'm not a smoker and i usually do n't like cigarette smoke , i 'm against these pictures . 
  they are fucking disgusting and i literally do n't know anyone who these persuaded to stop smoking . 
  there is one where they show a silhouette of a foetus , saying that smoking kills babies , every time one of my friends gets a package with that pic ... `` do n't smoke or you 'll get pregnant '' is what they say . 
  people do n't take it seriously . 
  never heard of it either . 
  i do n't really like to take medicine if i do n't have to , i wo n't start taking enhancement pills of any kind . 
  if i ca n't learn it i 'd rather fail the course . 
  although i heard chocolate/sugar can help so i usually eat a few pieces of choco or maybe a bar , but that 's it . 
  i have no idea whether it actually works or not ( i like to think it does ) , but i wo n't turn down a chance to eat some sweets . 
  good choice in my opinion , hopefully this will stimulate the growth of turism and be a good promotion for the hosting countries . 
  it might also be nice if the didnt host them all in capital cities . 
  almost got it , i mixed up estonia/latvia/lithuania , i just ca n't remember which is which . 
  edit : if someone is interested [ enigeo ] ( http://www.enigeo.org/en/ ) is a pretty good game just like the one linked . 
  the difference is that this has flags , capitals and includes every continent . 
  yes please . 
  yeah , if it 's domestic products than sure , but anything multinational will cost you or be the same . 
  for example electronics or clothing . 
  the worst part is everything costs the same or more here than it does in germany . 
  although admittedly i 'm better off than most of romania 's population , but i ca n't stop thinking how nice it would be if i everybody here could earn at least $ 500 a month and $ 1000 is really just a dream . 
  i 'm against federalisation , but if that is what it would take to get this country on track , i 'd might be willing to vote for it . 
  while i like the eu , i do n't like it that much and i 'm afraid it would turn into corporate america really quick alongside introduction of laws that again i would rather not have . 
  when i 'm abroad in a country where they usually ca n't speak english or german , i just pretend that my left palm is a paper and my right pointing finger a pen , pretend to write and say `` money '' . 
  they always understand it . 
  as for tips , i go for 10 % of the final fee . 
  i also find it disrespectful that for instance in italy they actually charge you the tip . 
  let that be my choice because if service is crap , i 'd rather not reward it with a tip . 
  do n't . 
  nukes should be absolute last resort . 
  i 'd watch this on tv . 
  thanks for the tip . 
  i 'll check them out . 
  aww , that 's too far away . 
  i was hoping some store chain carries it as i visit debrecen regularly . 
  which store sells that ? 
  same thing happened to my grandmother last year . 
  she received financial aid because she is blind completely on one eye and can barely see with the other . 
  they re-evaluated her documents , sent her to the doctors and after 15 + years they cut off the benefits because she can see enough to function in her home without aid . 
  1000 ron ( ~ 220 euros ) gone . 
  thankfully we have enough to support her , but her pension alone would n't be enough to cover all the bills in winter for instance . 
  that really rustled my jimmies especially because it 's clear it was politically motivated . 
  afaik a lot if not all people who were sent to retirement because of health issues were re-evaluated , most of them all people . 
  i 'm so fucking happy the dna is at least doing its job and putting the politicians behind bars . 
  all my friends started to drink strong bow ... fucking strong bow everywhere i go . 
  it 's especially popular with the lemon flavoured beer crowd . 
  yes , but the good thing with hungarian is that can you pretty much write everything down phonetically whereas in english that 's really bloody hard . 
  if ju n\u00f3 v\u00e1t \u00e1j m\u00edn  edit : forgot a word :p, 
  hungarians : tenses and why they have to use `` there '' in there is a cat in the living room . 
  also some/any . 
  sentence structure is more similar for romanians , as well as the use of the verb `` to be '' and some other stuff . 
  i am george . 
  in my opinion , it 's easier to learn english if you speak romanian instead of only hungarian and that 's probably the reason why more of the romanian youth can speak english while hungarian kids around here ca n't really . 
  yes . 
  i did this . 
  lost 42 kilos without much effort , you just have to be patient as weight loss is a slow process . 
  a word of advice though . 
  get used to muscle fever if you do n't exercise anything . 
  you had to move something heavy , muscle fever . 
  a dog chased you down the street , muscle fever . 
  you had sex , muscle fever . 
  as someone with a vodafone contract until august . 
  fuck that guy !, 
  probably made by some guy on a small scale from ops hometown or from a nearby village .

  that also helped . 
  yeah , currently we 're not at the same level . 
  but that not because of a lack of him . 
  we still have the rough cohabitation dynamics going . 
  we can return to the progress made under basescu , without ever needing the man himself . 
  we just need to get the votes right so we never have any person or party gaining the upper hand again . 
  this is why i was very dissapointed with the lack of federalization , despite it being a psd policy . 
  it would have given us another avenue for divide and conquer . 
  well , i do n't think it was inevitable . 
  i actually think we got extremely lucky . 
  we needed someone utterly incapable of cohabitation , but strong enough to hold his own against parliament . 
  the referendum might have gone another way if he was even a little bit less popular . 
  thank fuck apathy happened and he stayed on despite the results . 
  we also needed someone who was smart enough to place a competent unknown as head of the dna , but incapable enough to control them afterward . 
  his was truly a glorious presidency , but for all the wrong reasons . 
  to be fair , the case was lodged a year ago and it took time to finally go to court . 
  and it is fully in their rights to put it to trial . 
  unfortunately their undoing is that we are operating under treaties not a constitution . 
  and the treaties have made provisions for what happened , despite being procedurally unconstitutional . 
  intergovernmentalism is a bitch . 
  the issue is that the plan was half-baked in a lot of ways , likely purposefully . 
  there was no way for ee to keep the refugees from traveling away . 
  now , i imagine that was intentional to pretend that redistribution was happening while not burdening the ee . 
  but when the politicos found it paid to poke holes in the quota system , such shoddy planning worked against the proposal . 
  eastern european leaders are now taking the same stance merkel took in 2012 : not my problem . 
  if her government had an ounce of foresight this would not have happened , but that is the weakpoint of the administration , and complaining to the ee now is just hypocritical . 
  i think you 're painting a very rosy picture of him . 
  a lot of things around the anti-corruption fight happened despite him , rather than because of him . 
  in the end , it was the stand-off between him and the parliament which allowed the anti-corruption fight to start getting traction , if either won it would have been over the next day . 
  the lesson of his administration was : romania is run best when all the politicians are at each other 's throats . 
   ee did n't show any gratitude for what she did , tho . 
  germany literally spent the 2011-2015 period ignoring the problem by trying to enforce the dublin agreement on countries that were barely managing to keep the tide . 
  i think you overestimate how competent your political class is . 
  constant debate in democracy : should politicians represent or lead ? 
  the problem with representatives is that they give people what they want , even if it hurts them , without attention to everything else that is happening . 
  there is no plan , just a series of policy pieces decided by poll . 
  all the big , unsexy problems that are too complicated/boring to get popularity get forgotten . 
  a leader comes with a plan , and fixes issues most people might not even notice yet . 
  but no one 's going to vote for someone who fixes a problem before it hit the news , or a policy that will only produce returns 5 years down the line . 
  do n't listen to what sch\u00e4uble says , look at what he does . 
  he 's said one thing and done another before . 
  to be honest it would be very hard to recruit for the ema if it was placed in an eastern country , as disappointing as it is . 
  it stands a better chance of attracting people in strasbourg , and it does some good to institutional sanity in the eu . 
  it 's all sold on the world market for money . 
  no one 's discriminating for domestic taste , you strange , strange man . 
  capability and willingness are two different things . 
  canada was perfectly able to prevent their cod collapse . 
  did n't mean they were ever willing to do so till it finally happened . 
   i was obviously not really talking about british vs. danish waters , obviously , we should have a shared ` north sea policy ' , but such a policy would probably not work well for greek waters and vice versa . 
  fishing policy is all about keeping the stock up , and the stock is obviously not the same in denmark as it is a couple of thousands of kilometers away near cyprus . 
  there are actual different policies between the mediterranean and north sea . 
  one of the latest issues is that the med is having quotas imposed on it because of a decline in swordfish stock , where before they were free to fish . 
  it 's not one giant homogeneous eu fishing zone , like you believe . 
   anyone correct me if i 'm wrong , but i learned that dutch fishermen are trying to count and registering by-catch of species that are not at all in danger of being threatened , and obviously destroying them afterwards , for no reason whatsoever , other than that these stock are in danger in places elsewhere in the eu . 
  you 'd have to source this for me , because this can mean anything . 
  if these fish spend their early life in danish waters , then the very fact that the danes are fishing them might be endangering them in other waters and putting them at risk of collapse in general . 
  screwing over the next generation for today 's votes . 
   common policy for different waters make little sense what ? 
  how does that even work ? 
  there is no natural border between danish waters , british waters , french waters , and spanish waters . 
  anything found in those waters passes between them with little difficulty , and you 'd have a hard time figuring out where one end and another begins without a gps tracker . 
  and when it comes to fish stocks , all of that is one large `` commons '' grazed on by several different national industries each wanting bigger catches every year . 
  sooner or latter the inevitable happens and the commons are destroyed . 
  i do n't understand what imaginable improvement can be made from where we are today that can improve the lives of today 's fishermen and of those 20 years from now at the same time . 
  because right now , it 's nearly a mutually exclusive decision to make . 
  it 's trying to improve on the capacity of the c130 while doing all the things it can do . 
  so in short , it aims to be a hands down improvement of it 's main competitor . 
  the issue is that airbus 's engineering experience is restricted to turbofans and airport conditions , while design wants it to use turboprops and rugged conditions . 
  so 50 years of lack of experience is hitting us in the jaw as we 're learning as we go . 
  it 's the same with every big project , we simply do n't make big stuff in sufficiently close generations to learn the tricks of the trade before engineers retire , unless it has some cross-over with commercial applications . 
  while i do n't mean to undermine the achievement that the b52 is , a cargo plane while not as glamorous seems to have far more complexities associated with it than a strategic bomber . 
  to be fair , sch\u00e4uble talks out of both sides of your mouth . 
  it 's best to read his words very critically . 
  it 's going to be hard to find a majority exactly because he 's going to work against it . 
  anyone who saw him push the commission 's buttons over giving spain a fine over their budget , only to start make midnight calls to stop it when the commission gave in , knows his modus operandi . 
  he is not to be trusted . 
   no anonymous briefing , but a clear statement on the steps of downing street from the pm . 
  followed by a claim that the eu is seeking to manipulate the election ... from page 5 of the special edition of a non-english newspaper . 
  and in favour of who ? 
  another brexiter wearing a red rossette ? 
  you 're going to have a hard time claiming the high ground here . 
   read the article 50 letter . 
  this is public disclosure . 
  the one given to the eu ? 
  are standards that low ? 
  a handful of pages of saccharine wording , and veiled barbs do not a negotiating position make . 
   you are not the british public . 
  you do not think may 's approach is correct . 
  i am british . 
  i think may 's approach is the correct one . 
  unsurprisingly may is thinking about what i want , not what you want . 
  but of course . 
  i would expect to think about you want , you 're her target audience . 
  now make sure to not look behind mrs. may curtains of secrecy . 
  nothing behind there but strong and stable leadership . 
  do n't expect the rest of us to buy into the show , or remain politely detached from the fraud . 
  the uk government knows , and it has not been shy about using the leak to score political points . 
  it 's refusal to confirm or deny in that context does not look like polite prudence , but unwillingness to engage in a loosing battle . 
  in the end , when may asks for secret negotiations , secret meetings , and refuses public disclosure of even her negotiation goals as a sign of weakness , she denies information to only one relevant stakeholder : the british public . 
  it is exactly full disclosure and transparency .

  also , that was 27 years ago right after communism fell . 
  did you ever have to deal with communism in your country ? 
  you 're being ignorant . 
   that does n't imply no free trade [ eu parliament vows uk wo n't get free trade deal in the next two years ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-parliament-uk-no-free-trade-deal-two-years-brexit-talks-philip-hammond-optimism-theresa-may-city-a7655686.html )  meps also insisted that if theresa may seeks a transition deal , to cushion the economic blow from brexit , it can only run for three years and must be `` limited in scope '' . 
   there will be no special deal for the city of london giving `` preferential access to the single market and , or , the customs union '' , the parliament will also stipulate . 
  ...  it 's hardly valuable to trump or the us in any considerable way ... trump is obsessed about security . 
  he takes extreme measures that do little to ensure security , since most us terror attacks were domestic , while making it hard for others to come and go to the us . 
  this has a huge impact on any future trade deals . 
  you can be sure that any future trade deals with the us will imply the same draconian and futile security measures . 
  the uk did n't even justify their decision to implement the ban . 
   the ban follows a similar move in the us , where officials say bombs could be hidden in a series of devices . 
   downing street said it was `` necessary , effective and proportionate '' . 
  it 's pretty obvious why they did it ... 
   so now you 're just making assumptions . 
  you mean like  so , a bunch of dave 's from the local pub ? 
  remember that ? 
  it 's not just a huge assumption , it could also be interpreted as an insult , but i 'm not going there . 
    you do n't actually have any legitimate evidence . 
  here 's your evidence , bro . 
   [ theresa may on the need for eu free trade deal : ` i agree ' ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/theresa-may-eu-free-trade-deal-i-agree/ )  leigh asked : `` ** is not our objective this ** : that we want to conclude , having adopted every last eu law into our laws on brexit day , ** a free trade agreement ** , which is overwhelmingly in the interest of the rest of europe ? 
  incidentally , this would mean so much for the poorest nations of the world , as we lead a battle in the world for a free trade and prosperous world . ''  may responded : `` i agree . '', 
   lads this anti-uk circle jerk is getting very cringe-worthy now . 
  the same can be said about the anti-eu circle jerk the uk has been doing in the past few years . 
   brexit should not be forgotten . 
  it needs to be remembered so that others do not make the same mistake . 
   may has been quite vocal in her desire for it , she 's even said ** she wants it to be the freest ** , tradiest , dealiest of them all , so that 's probably her attempt to get as close to the common market as she can , ** without freedom of movement ** . 
  that 's exactly what the original article said . 
    britain should not be allowed to ` cherry-pick ' the benefits of eu membership while avoiding the costs . 
  tl ; dr : gim me money , but keep filthy your immigrants . 
  that 's not how the eu works . 
   there will be a trade deal for the uk , but it will suck compared with what they had before . 
   `` we do n't seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave '' . 
  that 's the uk is being cocky . 
  they tried to get free trade for nothing and failed . 
  now they 're saying they did n't want it in the first place . 
  it 's all part of the negotiations . 
   the uk wants a good deal , of course it does , that deal will have some costs , and as long as they are reasonable , the uk will be happy to compromise . 
  the uk refused a `` soft brexit '' . 
  it opted for a `` hard brexit '' without any free trade . 
  the deal has yet to be negotiated . 
  the uk is pushing for a good deal , but it has little leverage . 
  the uk needs the eu more than the eu needs the uk . 
   acting on intelligence however is n't mimicking policies , it 's reacting in a similar way to a perceived threat . 
  they `` reacted '' in exactly the same way days after the us enacted the same policy . 
  i call it butt kissing . 
  you call it `` sharing intelligence '' . 
  it 's a matter of perspective . 
  the uk is the only other country to enact this after the us did . 
   you think a laptop ban on flights will mean future trade deals with the us would be easier and more beneficial ? 
  it 's butt kissing . 
  when in rome , do as the romans . 
   in 2015 , the uk 's full membership fee was ** # 17.8 billion ** . 
  however , ** britain does n't pay that full fee . 
  ** because of a deal negotiated by margaret thatcher in 1984 , britain gets a `` rebate '' , an annual reduction in contributions . 
   in 2015 , that rebate reduced our contribution to ** # 12.9 billion ** . 
  shocker !, 
  [ how much money does britain currently pay the eu ? 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/how-much-do-we-spend-on-the-eu-and-what-else-could-it-pay-for/ ) here 's [ more info ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/625raq/82_of_europeans_surveyed_in_9_countries_opposed/dfk02m3/ ) . 
   eea membership , staying in the common market , is not free . 
  it involves responsibilities like norway has . 
  these include  the [ eea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_area#eea_and_norway_grants ) and norway grants are the financial contributions of iceland , liechtenstein and norway to reduce social and economic disparities in europe . 
  the uk did n't want any of that responsibility so the free trade deal fell . 
  hence the `` hard brexit '' . 
   i have n't seen anyone suggest that the uk will simply get everything it 'd like and not have to compromise . . [ britain has finally revealed its plan for brexit : it wants to negotiate a clean break with the european union and a new free trade deal at the same time . 
  ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/17/news/economy/theresa-may-brexit-speech-trade/ )  to be fair , the uk and us have a closer intelligence sharing arrangement than anyone else sharing intelligence is one thing . 
  mimicking their policies is another . 
  one could argue that policy was mimicked just so that future trade deals with the us would be easier and more beneficial . 
  aka butt kissing . 
   who is the article quoting ?

   who are you quoting ? 
  the article . 
  which is about a poll in 9 eu countries . 
   so far , the governments of the other 27 eu member states have been strongly united around two basic positions : that there should be no ` pre-negotiations ' before the formal triggering of article 50 , and that ** britain should not be allowed to ` cherry-pick ' the benefits of eu membership while avoiding the costs ** . 
  ...  ** find me the person ** who suggested that the uk should retain all of the freedoms while not committing to any of the responsibilities ... or is your typical strawman ? 
  persons . 
  plural . 
  about 17\u00a0410\u00a0742 brits voted to leave from the eu responsibilities . 
  that also includes leaving all the benefits . 
  i wanted to say  goodbye , felicia . 
  but all the other jokes are just way better . 
  true eu team work . 
   it would seem somewhat obvious that the uk ca n't be in the single market without the four freedoms it 's not just about freedoms , it 's about responsibilities as well . 
  the uk wants all of the freedoms while not committing to any of the responsibilities . 
  that 's not how the eu works . 
   you do n't get free trade and free labor movement without committing to support the eu . 
   the uk does respect human dignity , freedom , democracy , equality , the rule of law and have respect for human rights as long as it 's not immigrants . 
   seriously .

  not tanks ? 
  unfair hahaha that 's gold, 
  she sucks, 
  good typing there, 
  there 's a pretty cool thing called aa enplacements which romania and poland have a lot to deploy, 
  send all the troops you can send to poland , but we need a goddamn nato fleet in the black sea , and jets, 
  the only places where i can think of seeing such contracts around here are the ones for the summer season . 
  waiters on the seaside , room-service , that kind of shit . 
  no it ai n't , did you ever go to bucharest ? 
  and i dunno how the crime in nicosia is , but yeah the city looks pretty shit, 
  even udrea will get more votes than her , so good luck to her and her useless campaign, 
  the hitler analogy does n't work in this case since if germany managed to develop it first they would 've been the only ones to have it . 
  now everyone and their dog has a nuke , so it 's a guarantee that if you nuke a country you 'll start a world apocalypse . 
  friends , yeah right . 
  on a political level against russia , yeah you guys are alright . 
  but i 've seen enough from polish surveys regarding romanians to see how `` friendly '' you are . 
  it 's funny how these polish fucks have been complaining so much about france not listening to sanctions , but now they 're also doing it, 
  yes it is , anyone can use it you cunt, 
  another country destroyed by russia 's communism, 
  pro-russia before , and now it raises it 's military spending to counter russia . 
  make up your damn mind orban, 
  i fucking dare them to try anything with bro-pope , they 'll get a crusade on their ass so hard they 're gon na cry, 
  no , i mean the numbers you posted do n't show me anything . 
  2012 was a drought year , even on the link you posted it shows 2011 3993 , higher than both ukraine and poland in 2011 . 
  2013 and 2014 were great agricultural years and the yields are well over 4k, 
  hell , he can go right ahead imo . 
  i want to see russia burn, 
  the only countries where that bullshit would work is the baltics , quite a lot of russians there . 
  good thing most of nato 's newly-deployed troops are stationed right there, 
  yeah sorry i misread the news , thought it was an alliance against russia , and we would n't join it . 
  he can go fuck himself with this proposal or plan of his, 
  we 'll keep them away even if we 'll have to go to war, 
  alright , and ? 
  you guys need tanks , helicopters and jets . 
  not fucking rifles and grenades, 
  finally someone took the job again to post news from here . 
  good job, 
  targovishte means marketplace in cyrilic . 
  more like we stole it : v ours is more awesome than the bulgarian one tho , so we win . 
  we may not be in the visegrad group , but romania will always support poland against russia . 
  rds are the guys who are basically the boss of the internet providers over here . 
  romtelecom always sucked dick , so no worries rds will still give us fast speeds , 
  moldovans are having trouble with romanian , english even more so, 
  you 're in fucking nato , act like it , the fuck is all this bullshit you 're going about with territory, 
  so first the eu bitched about us opressing the gypsies . 
  then we joined the eu , the eu started draining all of our professionals . 
  and now they 're suddenly opressing the gypsies as-well but it 's okay now cause the west are n't a bitch like the east is . 
  i 'm starting to hate the eu, 
  it 's not like italy ever contributed anything significant to nato . 
  usa would build the base , not you pompous asses . 
  ponta has always been pro-nato/eu . 
  it 's getting silly hearing people talking about psd members like they 're russian commies or something no reason for him to suddenly . . be against nato and go for russia or whatever, 
  romania , since it 's the only country i give a shit about, 
  that 's a soviet parade if i 've ever seen one, 
  oh yeah no corrupt politician has been arrested in the last years , nope . 
  you 're a fucking moron , scapegoating , wow . 
  vlad tepes was a hero of our country , and he was turned into a caricature for foreigners to scare their kids with , or in the case of sparkling vampires for their kids to fall in love with . 
  ofc i 'm pissed . 
  regarding the pen , it 's the fountain pen . 
  invented by petrache poenaru , google him and stop talking bullshit . 
  the ballpoint pen was also invented by a hungarian , not an american you douchebag . 
  you know jack-shit but still type like you actually know what you 're talking about . 
  of course , there had to be a vampire, 
  as i said , even without the russian peacekeepers moldova would get rolled on . 
  transnistria 's standing army is better equipped than moldova 's, 
  why does everyone forget about bulgaria ? 
  no offense but moldova 's pathetic army would get rolled on by transnistria 's without any help from the outside . 
  i do n't think moldova even has tanks , while they do . 
  another quality post by bleahbloh everyone, 
  well it is an economic union after-all . 
  if the eu wanted to make a single army the members would bitch about that too . 
  what the fuck ion creanga wrote that ?? 
  well shit he was a pretty cool guy, 
  why is this illegal ? 
  who can prove he just did n't find penises while walking around the woods and started a collection ? 
  he 's asking about how much the eu exports cars and car parts to russia, 
  i can agree with that , the media has been talking about this `` technical recession '' like we 're going into an actual recession, 
  those two numbers are so small and insignificant it does n't even matter if they 're positive or negative, 
  haha , point at him and laugh, 
  the institute changed the figures literally the next day . 
  and what a huge difference +0.2 % changed to -0.2 % . 
  wow it 's fucking nothing . 
  that 's why we got ta build mini-walls/dividers to separate the lanes , and also poles so drivers will dent their car if they try anything . 
  fun, 
  rekt, 
  because there 's no such thing as bike lanes built on the side of the road anywhere in romania ? 
  b-bucuresti it 's a ro plate also poles have been added in the middle of the bicycle lanes as you can see in my picture , drivers ca n't do that shit anymore . 
  more like to stop drivers from parking/driving through the lanes , along with the poles that are in the middle of the bicycle lanes . 
  woah , holy shit that 's awesome, 
  it was a matter of time considering the debt serbia acquired in the last years . 
  scare the ukrainians , make them panic . 
  pretty good idea imo . 
  call me stupid but i think these are separatists giving their try at propaganda . 
  why the fuck does the cameraman show only the soldiers scratching their balls and nothing else ? 
  if they taste good , why not ? 
  ca n't get more cheesy than that . 
  look at `` percentage change compared to the same quarter of the previous year '' http://www.prikachi.com/images/725/7537725s.jpg that 's what 's important, 
  nope, 
  that kind of growth is not worth anything if you plan on catching up with the west . 
  we 'll see when romania 's growth gets published tomorrow,

  basically more than unilateral economic sanctions one country can not do and any other form of interventionism is a form of aggression . 
  the free world is they wanted to respect un rules and no consensus would be achieved at the council level , then they should have stay out of it entirely and let assad rap things really quickly with the help of the russians ( since they were invited military by a sovereign country ) . 
  is this the project that the chinese want to import and mass produce back home ? 
  i have nothing against this as long as my czech friends get some on discount , 
   it tries to force us to obliterate our lowered utility costs what do they mean ? 
   for it in italy 1200-1600 euro net monthly . 
  1600 net is considered a good salary . 
  kinda low ... more like below rome ... 
  they all * read it * and they say : better that they die in the mediterranean than for us to be forced to confront their existence among us ... sad but this is what i read from their comments . 
  i have another theory : the russians planed assad 's chemical attack just to test how the usa will react . 
  also both putin and trump need direct military confrontations in order to redirect the pressure at home . 
  ( this is not mine , it was from an opinion article i read recently ) . 
  rip :(, 
  i also believe the assad regime used chem weapons , but in un council as long as 1 member has a different opinion , no matter how unfounded ... the others ca n't do shit . 
  poking around is what russians have been doing with us for several years now . . 
  i know ... ve been there . 
  where comes the problem from ? 
  the education system ? 
   if he can `` fix '' the problems france has not sure anyone can ... 
  besides economic problems , there are cultural problems and no one knows how to address them and not fall in one of the extreme : a fascist approach or the tyranny of the political correctness . 
   why would assad have done this ? 
  see the bigger picture . 
  russia wants to see how the usa administration reacts . 
  if usa leaves russia do whatever they want there , next poking will be another offensive in ukraine and if that is also successful probably active diversive actions in the baltics or against the romania in the black sea . 
  there are other means to deploy those chemical attacks besides air strikes . 
  how can a un resolution pass since russia will veto it since it was the rebels who used the chemical weapons ... ? 
  during that period a lot of the landmarks were created by private funds . 
  wealthy people were more connected to community than nowadays . 
  the bad hombres ? 
  my fair question is ... ok but who do people want to kill ? 
  oh thank you kind sir !, 
  as long as you place it without sound yes !, 
  yes he speaks so fast can barely keep up  ), 
  about time ... 
  do n't know bro , i 'm a hard core federalist . 
  but for me as a romanian it 's an easy stance since i have everything to gain and almost nothing to loose . 
  but this is the rhetoric in many western countries ... people are fed up with us ... and nobody has a vaccine for this while most politicians are just hoping that this will pass as a teenage phase ... 
  u are putting in same basket the rational economic interests of the elites and the average joe ... the average joe has only to loose just cause he has to consider the ee or the se on equal footing with him ... his society is superior means he is superior ... and on his land the rule of blood should favor him since everyone are his guests . 
  they would have those privileges regardless cause they are from rich developed countries . 
  the eu brings nothing extra ... 
  but when he drinks it 's 105 !, 
  what is the story behind dark blue passports ? 
  yes ... mainly cause of national rhetoric back home where governments use the eu as a scapegoat and also as a mean to bypass national legislative process . 
  why debate and argue with your opposition when you can arrange everything at brussels with experts so that it comes as a eu directive ... 
  for you , but for the dutch or the french this means nothing cause they will never need these rights ... 
  they will w8 a couple of years and they will another one :p, 
  but there are also bonuses , like being a principal bonus 15 % , or being a homeroom teacher 10 % and having a 1y or a 3y gradation ( bonus for high quality work - most have it ) which is also around 25 % i think . 
  my mother managed to reach several years ago as principal above 3500 net . 
  hope they are better than obama 's :p, 
  hard to say ... india is a big market but it is an undeveloped one ... 
  id put uk in the left upper corner tbh  ), 
  if they work in romania they have to abide to romanian state law . 
  well it lest they did n't get minimum wage as us ... or wait was the 1450ron before or after taxes ? 
  : / if the company provides housing and food they can survive in romania with 300 euro . 
  cool . . but where are we ... 
  they could do the same , the areas just overlap due to how that fking rock stands out ... 
  the fact is that considering the terrain it is very hard to apply 12 miles rule . 
  the zones just overlap ... and traffic should favor fastest cheapest route for both countries ... 
  he would be a lovely woman if he would skip the beard ... lol,

  epic spending for state employees ' wages , increases raging 20 % to 50 % , with similar revenues as last year while still having to cut on infrastructure ( which we need ... mainly highways and new hospitals ) . 
  this is quite catchy,

  it is really frustrating that your biggest ally is cheering against you ... 
  a lot of eu countries don ; t have built in secession mechanism .

  and now english is for everything  ), 
  its because her putin support and money scandals that no one wants to give her money on principle ... so yeah ... karma sux, 
  freedom of speech i guess , 
  yes but in tramps case they were very close . 
  and even in the popular vote hillary \\ s margin was n't that big . 
  uk just wants no freedom of movement and no obligation to implement eu laws/directives but everything else should remaining equal . 
  lol, 
  you are naive it 's not the eu that wants these is the governments that agree with the laws through the council . 
  but it is the simplest way to pass legislation because if it comes as a eu directive the national parliament does not have a say and legislation that normally would take years for national parliaments or would just be stopped gets done fast . 
  sometimes is good like anti corruption directives in romania or maybe bad like some regulation in other countries . 
  this goes without saying , but these new regulations do n't target criminal .

after more than two decades , some 300 million kebabs at about 6 euros each are eaten in 10,200 outlets in france maybe they should warn as to why the fuck a kebab is 6 $ in france . 
  is it just me or is that very expensive . 
  currently live in austria and you can get them ( decent ones ) from 3.5 $ up . 
  they are protesting because next time they might have to pay 0.5 $ to see all the karma they get, 
  is the cap per individual or per subscription ? 
  i mean do you / u/bazmeg have to pay 2.5 $ for all your subscriptions or for each one ? 
  edit : i 'm thinking of this situation : 1 land internet connection used for pc , one mobile connection ( 3g ) for smartphone . 
  you use 100 gb on the computer and 2 gb on the smartphone . 
  do you pay 2.5 $ or 3.5 $ ( 2.5 $ for pc and 0.5 $ x2 for phone ) edit 2 : changed device to subscription .

  since their last removal project they figured out that sending kebab to their neighbors is much faster than removing them internally, 
  these have to be the classiest chimney sweepers i have ever seen, 
  here i disagree with you . 
  the purpose of a judge is to decide if a person is guilty of a crime . 
  if then person is guilty that his/her job is to give a sentence based on the severity of the crime , not the social implications of that crime . 
  what did the accused do ? 
  did he just touched the child ? 
  - lower sentence did he rape the child ? 
  - higher sentence did the rape the child multiple times ? 
  - even higher sentence these are the things a judge should take into account when giving a sentence . 
  it is not the fault of the accused that the peers of the victim are so intolerant . 
  his fault was committing the crime for which he presents a danger to society . 
  prison sentences are seen as a mean to make an individual understand he did something wrong and maybe to reintegrate them in society ( if possible ) . 
  there are not seen as a revenge for the suffering of the victim . 
  even if they were why would he have to pay for the suffering that was endured at the hands of other ( the child 's fellow peers ) ? 
  let me put it another way . 
  if you were driving at night and hit a woman with your car ( assuming she survives ) , do you think it 's normal to get a longer sentence because her family thinks it 's not ok for women to walk outside at night and therefore they are shaming her ? 
  or do you thing it 's normal to get the sentence based on the fact that you were not paying attention and hit a human ? 
   the shaming of the victims and their families done by their peers is what 's aggravating the situation and who 's fault is that exactly ? 
  the perpetrator 's or the fellow peers of the family ? 
  why must the perpetrator be punished more because of how some group views his crime ? 
  his crime is hideous , i get that , but there is no justification for the increased sentence . 
  are we next going to force harsher punishments on a muslim drunk driver because his religion forbids him drinking alcohol ? 
  as opposed to the regular punishment someone else will get ? 
  let me guess , lack of cycling lanes ?

  dave cameron does what dave cameron does because dave cameron is ... dave cameron . 
   offtopic : why the odd font ? 
  is that a greek thing ? 
  same thing i thought when i first saw it . 
  that is a really weird font and the usage of different sizes for emphasis makes it harder to read . 
  just using bold would have been enought, 
  i am genuinely surprised by the lack of catalans asking the rest of spain just how much greek-like behavior do they have to impersonate before the spanish can let them secede, 
  dude , we in romania have vampires !, 
  i 'm just saying , if your plan for the greeks does n't work out you can try with us , 
  someone please photoshop tsipras ' face on this !, 
  and while your at it do the same for varoufakis . 
  we could use it every time there is news about the creditors proposing a new deal for greece !, 
   / u/strukkstar [ 2 ] question might not have been well formulated that 's why i said  serbia is n't `` closing it 's borders '' i think he wanted to know how many serbians will profit from this not that  serbia is n't `` closing it 's borders '' which is a valid point . 
  some will profit . 
  it 's just that his question was not well put, 
   i am just carrying 10 syrians in my backpack as i write this what a noob !, 
  if you get [ two of these ] ( http://fs72.trilulilu.ro/imgs/ioana_j/3-plase-de-rafie_803708be0b4a63.jpg?size=original ) you can easily smuggle 30 syrians !, 
  on a serious note , / u/strukkstar question might not have been well formulated but chances are some serbians will smuggle the immigrants . 
  it 's just like with the cigarette smuggling from serbia , ukraine and moldova into romania and hungary ( not sure here , maybe a hungarian can confirm ) . 
  if there is enough incentive people will smuggle . 
  and it 's not just the serbians , but probably romanians , hungarians , etc. 
  will do it too . 
  out of curiosity . 
  do you know anyone who had their license revoked for 15 years ? 
  what would someone have to do to get it revoked for that long ? 
  edit : also , what 's the legal limit in poland ? 
  does n't every country have something like this ? 
  in romania we say something like : romania is such a beautiful country .

  probably not the only ones . 
  actually , spain , portugal and italy have been extremely supportive of an eu-funds fraud prosecutor called the eppo . 
  as have romania and bulgaria . 
  i think we 're all waking up to a need for change . 
   hmmmm , could the eu put anti corruption laws into european law ? 
  would this be a good idea ? 
  look up the eppo . 
  it 's not exactly what we need , but it 's a start . 
  right now the major opposing governments are : the netherlands , hungary , poland and greece . 
  if you 're in one of these countries , your government is weakening the fight against corruption . 
   i mean , i think this entire situation is pretty shitty , but using it as a stab at countries desire for sovereignty is kind of a long shot . 
  do you honestly think countries should give up their sovereignty to the eu ? 
  we did n't have sovereignty in the last 500 years , despite being `` independent '' countries , and now what we need more than ever is support to maintain the rule of law against the powerful . 
  so fuck your illusion of sovereignty . 
  it does n't exist , there is either the rule of might or the rule of law . 
  pick one . 
  you do realize we 're all on one landmass right ? 
  if one country , let alone one region , decides to go baby crazy before the next industrial revolution , the resulting unemployment dominoes . 
  just look at the effect of the arab spring . 
  russia is a different ball game altogether . 
  who the fuck knows what they 'll do . 
  i swear , all the trading algorithms are hooked on trump news and what we 're seeing is a bunch of brainless machines being burned out on a high-follower presidency that hits all their key-word searches like a meth addict with a sledgehammer . 
  i was thinking of the wider arctic circle . 
  but you 're right , the uk has no claims in it . 
   does the uk have claims on the artic ? 
  apparently , despite me thinking otherwise , neither iceland or the uk do . 
  my bad . 
   anyway canada and norway are both in nato so a lot of the eu could be involved . 
  not everything trickles down to nato status . 
  it 's not like it has an arbitration system in place . 
  it did n't make the cod wars go away . 
  any economic struggle will likely be solved through everything short of military intervention , which means power blocks will form around who gets what and subsequent economic and political pressure used to carve up space . 
  if we do decide to take a side , it 's likely to be for greenland/denmark . 
  in which case we 'd be brought into conflict with canada , who i would n't be surprised will strike a deal with america for share-and-support . 
  that 's not really soros , that 's just western virtue signalling non-sense . 
  they have no actual plan , or agenda , it 's mostly a bunch of buzz-words and fuzzies stuck to young folk with too much energy , too little thinking and something to prove . 
  except the same sort of people start stealing power from underneath them as well , and re-organizing the country to serve the political offices . 
  as we 've seen in hungary , turkey , poland and russia . 
   i get your point but i disagree . 
  if a eu member was attacked , i do believe all countries would immediately send troops . 
  in this case everyone knows what will happen if they do n't . 
  but are we going to be quick enough , are we going to coordinate well enough , will we waste time fighting over command and strategy ? 
  and if the russian initiate `` nuclear deescalation '' , what then ? 
  you have no idea how scared some of us , that we 've built a sand fort . 
  you 're learning the reality of geopolitics . 
  it has little or nothing to do with some imaginary number for economic production . 
  it 's about force , influence and leverage . 
  neither gdp , nor nato , can spare us if we turn out to be nothing more than a bunch of paper tigers . 
  even china fell to barbarians . 
   clash of civilizations by samuel p. huntington seems more accurate than ever in that respect . 
  that 's because it 's been the goal of the neo-conservatives even since the start of the millennium , they 've created their own self-fulfilling prophecy . 
  and in turn , the fundamentalist conservatives forces in the middle east gain support for their anti-western narrative . 
  the conservatives of the world on all sides , russia , america , middle east , all are running the biggest scam the world has ever seen , without ever needing to talk to each other . 
  simply by egging each other on , and scarring everyone into line . 
  i was suspecting that with the uk gone and greenland in a grey area , the eu would loose its last remaining link to arctic resource rights , and we can avoid being drawn into the conflict against our will , maybe even finally have something we and the norwegians can side on . 
  apparently it was n't meant to be . 
   as a former eu federalist i nowadays totally agree with the stance of this article . 
  as a former europhobe i believe that anyone who starts a sentence with `` as a former '' is a grifter out to sell you something , and is buttering you up . 
   i actually ca n't feel any pressure from the russians , in fact i think that this whole thing is pushed on us by the mainstream media , and people would n't even talk about it if it was n't mentioned every other week . 
  you do n't feel it till it hits . 
  the explosion in budapest awhile ago eventually got linked to their patsies . 
   the thing that really can not be unseen though is the whole moral and attitude of the nation : nobody wants to work properly , nobody cares about rules , everybody is trying to get everything as easily as they can . 
  i 've noticed . 
  everyone wants to be the smart guy . 
  no one has anything to be smart about . 
  it 's not uncommon anywhere . 
  really ? 
  they burn the house down , and then want to set fire to the ashes . 
  fuck them . 
  i 'm pretty sure if i started an ngo using my own funds , i 'll soon find i 'd been funded by soros as well . 
  we 've had the government run `` soros-link '' accusations against the anti-corruption fight as well . 
  it 's become a sort of `` red scare '' to paint opposition with . 
  you sound like a most excellent and erudite roadtrip rascalion . 
  party on sir . 
   it 's not really . 
  culture is important and there is a difference between regions . 
  the u.s and northern europe was build with the thought of protestant work ethic . 
  productivity is in general higher in the north . 
  do n't hold back , gives us a good dressing down at how much better your upbringing is , how much harder working you are , and maybe a few euphemisms about having `` the right heritage '' . 
   again i disagree . 
  if you have talent you will most likely get good employment pretty quickly . 
  even if you do not find your dream job right away a temporary job could lead to it in the future . 
  that sucky job in retail could lead you to a high paying job in the company hq . 
  you just got to see opportunities . 
  ahh , the just world fallacy . 
  you 're a conservative . 
  ok , sorry for bringing everyone else into this . 
  but this , the links between jobbik and russian diplomats , as well as fidesz relationship with russia is making me uncomfortable . 
  and it feels like there is a `` core '' in hungarian society that wants the old days to return . 
  a grant received three years ago through an ngo partially funded by someone , is a very tenuous foundation to call something `` a personal megaphone '' . 
  especially when we have completely owned media , like the murdoch empire , and actual `` person writes the stuff '' media like breibart , or word-for-word copies of press releases like what we saw from robert amsterdam . 
  i 'm not going to say that soro 's money does n't have influence . 
  but in my experience he 's become a scapegoat for anyone who ca n't be bothered to face the facts at hand . 
  it 's watered down the actual proof , and made me very skeptical . 
   but if your mentality is common many places further south in europe it really is n't surprising how the north is richer . 
  that is an unnecessary comment . 
  i 'm actually a cross between a dirigist and an ordoliberalist . 
  i believe the government has a right and duty to manage and drive the economic future of a country , and ensure industrial evolution to maintain competativeness as well as fairness . 
  i too believe in the importance of work . 
  of meaningful work , of owned worked , and of sustainable work .

  gay parades should be banned because they harm the gay community . 
  am i the only one who hates these things ? 
  only if they 're fucking stupid uncultured swines . 
  something someting ... polan can not into space . 
  that will be their downfall and they know it . 
  let 's not exaggerate . 
  let 's be honests with ourselves . 
  in romania someone like orban or le pen would never rise . 
  but not because of the welcoming tolerance and political intelligence of the romanian people , or at least not mainly because of that . 
  the main factor that prohibits the rise of classical populists ( you may argue that psd is populist , yes , but to a certain degree ) is the much too recent memory of a hated and horrible regime . 
  i 'm talking here about the fascist type of communism we had here . 
  we have the same expression !, 
  those damn gypsies from germany , coming here to steal and beg . 
  no :( i ca n't squat for shit ( pun intended ) . 
  maybe not culturally , yes . 
  but genetically yes . 
  we 're more slavic than the south slavs , for example . 
  * heavy breathing *, 
  thanks !, 
  dude . . you ca n't say things like this to a romanian and expect to walk out of this on your own legs . 
  we go apeshit when this happens . 
  that 's because we kinda are slavic . 
  you wo n't hear this very often from a romanian . 
  it 's a combination of factors . 
  keep in mind that only 3000000 of people voted for psd-alde . 
  yeah , i 'm gon na need a source on that ` our people become less and less educated ' . 
  if you really want to insult someone tell him he is as useful as that dictionary . 
  right in the feels , man . . 
  you did n't understand me . 
  i am not a revisionist . 
  mistakes have been made by both sides . 
  but saying that romanians were n't persecuted before ww1 is detrimental to the historical truth . 
  no , they were n't killed or discriminated openly . 
  but they were viewed as second-class citizens of the empire . 
  a gone gypsy is a good gypsy . 
  i do n't care anymore how are romanians perceived because of them . 
  i just want them out . 
  do you feel me ? 
  dumb fuck is quite different from delusional . 
  first , your english is bad . 
  second , i did n't say a bad word about you and you should do the same . 
  third , i mentioned ww2 because you try to portray hungarians as a nation of angels through history and it 's simply not true . 
  you 're delusional . 
  i do n't see any point in discussing this with you . 
  be it like you wish : hungarians were some angels who never did any harm to romanians . 
  not even in ww2 . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-romanian_sentiment#kingdom_of_hungary_and_austria-hungary https://youtu.be/04r5xvegn0q?t=1m55s they did n't have any political rights and they were second class citizens . 
  how can you deny it ? 
  how can you live in your own world ? 
  and stop being so condescending , it 's annoying , especially when you 're an arrogant irredentist . 
  because what was before trianon was indeed justice . 
  a whole region where the majority population was persecuted is justice for you ? 
  you wan na trigger us all ? 
  cause that 's how you trigger us . 
  what the hell are you trying to communicate ?? 
  yeah , we better bathe in the blood of the innocent aborted fetuses than introduce sex ed in schools . 
  never understood this kind of logic . 
  ayy , some good ol' magyar irredentism before going to bed . 
  yeah , the only difference is that nowadays , as it was in 1918 , romanians formed the majority of transilvania . 
  what gives hungary rights over transylvania ? 
  i never understood this kind of rhetoric . 
  yes . 
  and i replied to you . 
  romania was n't really united until 1918 . 
  jobbik-tier shit ? 
  what 's so jobbik about the celebration of the union of the principalities ? 
  do n't worry , you 're compensating well . 
  sa traiesti , manca-ti-as portofelu ' . 
  sometimes i really wonder why hungary is n't number one in salt production in europe . . 
  calm your wurst , fritz . 
  no one is taking your euro moneyz . 
  til i 'm not european . 
  well , tbh , i never considered myself fully european . 
  i always felt like a third-class eu citizen . 
  and i am sure a lot of `` westerners '' have the same opinion . 
  but hell , i do n't blaim them . 
  i thpught he looks like father grigori from half life 2 . 
  no way !!, 
  i have never seen a more pretentious school of film than that in romania . 
  everything has to be deep and characters often ponder life decisions while eating soup for half a film . 
  all set in a grey world . 
  so pessimistic . 
  * shots fired *, 
  dude looked like he was releasing the most fire raggae album of 2016 . 
  undead from teleorman here , can confirm . 
  nope , it should n't . 
  no , it should n't . 
  no , it should n't . 
  no , it should n't . 
  no , it should n't . 
  no , it should n't . 
  no , it should n't . 
  describing american culture as a salad is quite ironic , is n't it ? 
  i2 is the dominant haplogroup . 
  it 's the southern proto-european haplogroup . 
  the map , at least in regards to romania is n't very accurate . 
  maternal line does n't influence y-dna haplogroup . 
  so wife stealing has nothing to do with r1a being present in large numbers in scandinavia . 
  r1b is western european mainly . 
  huns probably had an asian haplogroup .

  democracy is merely the temple on top of a larger foundation . 
  read my comment to him . 
  my suspicion is that the core has decided that the v4 are not worth bothering with anymore , and might actually be the ones posing a danger to the eu project . 
  if this is actually correct and not just media getting ahead of itself before the ecj ruling then the only option i can think of that they 're paraleling this and the polish rule of law sanctions : the v4 have become a net liability , and they 're being convinced to drop out . 
  it does make sense , but it would be really atipical of the eu to be this brash . 
  the v4 are very high net receivers during a time we 're going to see a severe budget cut , they 're obstructionists when we 're trying to better intergrate the eurozone and defence , they 're refusing eppo anti-corruption measure , eu border control and asylum unity , and they 're a giant security risk either because they antagonize russia ( poland ) or pander to it ( hungary ) . 
  they are a stone around the neck , providing very little except recrimination . 
  but they ca n't kick them out without looking bad , so they 're building the pressure so either the v4 crack or get out of their own volitions . 
  or at the very least drop to eea status forcing a multi-speed europe without the core needing to move an inch to make it happen . 
  we 're now all afraid that if we show a bit of weakness at any point due to an internal struggle , they 'll invade and annex . 
  i really do n't get how that is difficult to comprehend . 
  they 've turned every russian outside of russia into a political hazard without ever asking them their opinion or permission . 
  just went all out and declared them theirs by right , and by extension any territory they happen to be living in . 
   assuming we left the eu tomorrow the uk would be the eus biggest export market ( as you would be ours ) . 
  we actually run a trade deficit with virtually every eu country ( slightly out of date research but anyway ... ) . 
  the `` best customer walking away '' is n't as big a deal as you think it is . 
  we 're not your butcher down the corner , and you ca n't really `` walk away '' . 
  i 'm happy that the `` prosseco and cars '' mentality has n't gone away though , need a good laugh when negotiations come . 
   ps britain pushed for the enlargement of the eu meaning countries like yours are now members , britain was also heavily involved in widening the single market , so it 's a little unfair that britain 's influence always seems to be seen in a negative light . 
  and then you called us scum , tried to destroy freedom of movement , and confirmed our fears that what was really wanted is for us to open our markets to western money and corporations to destroy and buy local businesses , while we become a colony of consumers and natural resources . 
  you do n't have your finger on the pulse here . 
  not in the world and not in europe . 
  sort of how the iraq army was the 4th largest before the first gulf war ? 
  if we take the us , the eu , china and japan , the uk comes in a far distant 5th . 
  half the gdp of japan , a fraction of the rest . 
  i simply do n't think y' all comprehend the scales here and are getting a bit deluded for the sake of an ego trip . 
  it 's not even 3rd , bronze , it 's 5th , no metal anyone cares to give because it 's bloody fifth . 
  the danish minister had a point , and the fact that y' all hurry to the rescue with what are really just laughable platitudes underlines it , not undermines it . 
  scottish monarchy , not living in scotland does n't stay very scottish . 
  also at the time of the escalation the monarch was william of orange , hardly scottish , and the subsequent move towards embracing the house of hanover pleased absolutely no one as can be seen by the jacobite movement , although i think at that point it was mostly political rather than monarchical or religious considerations governing the need to secede . 
  merkel comes down hard when she picks a side , she does n't try to stay in the middle . 
  fukushima : close down all nuclear reactors , buy coal , make coal lobby happy . 
  she 's good at that . 
  even the refugee crisis was her checking the polls after years of telling italy to solve it on it 's own , and realizing that she ca n't send them back to hungary she decided to come down hard on taking people in , looking like she saved greece , italy , hungary that she legaly could n't send people back to while with the other hand pushing the asylum quotas to send them somewhere else . 
  the woman is too smart for everyone else 's good . 
   england never forced scotland to attempt the darien scheme in the 1690s . 
  england did n't create the diseases and untoward weather that killed the colonists and made the colony unviable . 
  england did n't bankrupt scotland and make the notion of union with the uk seem attractive . 
  except exactly that . 
  the navigation acts , the wars , the blockades , the embargo all slowly sucked the country dry . 
  the east india company actually influenced investors to withdraw money from the project . 
  [ this info is on the damn bbc page btw ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zv7p34j/revision/5 )  scotland has benefited immensely by being part of the uk . 
  it 's population and economy has been stagnant since ww2 , as it hovered above 5 million during a major world wide population boom and it became so poor it 's still receiving eu cohesion funds while glasgow is considered one of the poorest areas in western europe , with health implication so dire that it has it 's own name , `` the glasgow effect '' . 
   edinburgh was the ` second city ' of the british empire for a time after all . 
  it was glasgow that was the second city of the british empire . 
  not edinburgh . 
   scotland 's stunningly beautiful cities and towns are testament to the influx of wealth provided by the union . 
  have you ever been to scotland outside of maybe edinburgh city center ? 
  because it shows . 
  and the scottish threatened to stop it with the act of security , which was the point of the economic warfare and the subsequent bribery into union . 
  to prevent scotland from splitting off from what had become the de-facto english monarchy seated in london . 
  you 're right , the right word is bought . 
  scotland was bought . 
  after a period of economic warfare starting with the act of settlement 1701 , then using the aliens act 1705 to empose an embargo and confiscate scottish property , then ending with the bribery of the scottish parliamentary members . 
  edit : downvotes ? 
  for paraphrasing the national poet of scotland ? 
  `` the english steel we could disdain ; secure in valour 's station ; but english gold has been our bane - such a parcel of rogues in a nation . '', 
  the offensive line from the danish finance minister :  `` there are two kinds of european nations . 
  there are small nations and there are countries that have not yet realized they are small nations . '', 
  so migrants ( refugees really , since we can legally deport simple migrants ) are like rain , wind , or earthquakes and countries that get them should n't ask or expect support ? 
  we 've just had a bunch of member states privately bully others over loans , russia grabbing territory right off our shores , a large migration of unarmed people overcoming several borders , and a financial crash that systematically wiped out a good bit of european gdp . 
  this was btw while germany , france and even the commission were saying `` the answer is n't more europe '' . 
  how about actually getting some integration done before starting keeping it in check ? 
  might as well wall every city while you are at it . 
  there is no great difference between national borders and eu borders , the only difference is that some people are only on your side when the weather is good and run and hide when it shifts . 
  i 'm perfectly glad for the countries that want to be alone again , to stay alone . 
  being in a country that is not in schengen , i 'd prefer if we joined our european brothers in mutual support . 
   it 's hard to stay in the middle . 
  you end attacked from both sides . 
  this is true everywhere . 
  moderation is a fools game in politics . 
  your only hope is to change the topic of conversation to something you can take a side and be bang on right about . 
  never try to survive in a centrist position during an argument for long . 
  let me guess , you live in one of the poor transit countries no one want to go to and the dublin/quota arrangement threatens that little bit of irrelevance ? 
  the issue is that germany can very well just not take them , as the right wing keep asking . 
  it can shut the borders , stop asylum applications , and let them rot in calais-like camps in italy , austria and czechia . 
  do this across the whole eu , and the schengen area is gone and you have these camps in every country as some do manage to sneak in one border at a time , forcing germany to make an even harder border , and so on and so forth until economic activity grinds to a halt . 
  and the bigest loosers of that is greece and italy , who 've always had migrants washing onshore and ca n't help the fact that there are warzones not far from their coasts . 
  australia pays niue off to make sure that it acts as a transit country that stops them . 
  we do the same for turkey and it 's worked just like niue , no more 2015 mass of people . 
  we ca n't do it for lybia because there is no one to pay there . 
  but that does n't make what i said invalid : australia picks them up quickly and send them to niue . 
  we pick them up and send them where ? 
  both dublin agreement and asylum quotas mean someone has to take them in , but everyone just wants germany to do it and shut up about it . 
  it 's not a border issue , is the problem . 
  it 's an economic migration and asylum issue . 
  borders have zero to do with it , because it starts in lybia and syria where warzones are and gains inertia from there as actual refugees mix with economic migrants . 
  this means that in the end there are transit countries ( which are poor ) and destination countries ( which are rich ) . 
  transit countries ( italy , turkey , greece , macedonia and serbia ) do n't want them to come to them and vice versa and trying to keep them out is a giant costly pain in the ass . 
  so , it 's cheaper and easier to just let them pass , and make them not your problem . 
  destination countries ( germany , sweden , uk ) also consider keeping them out , but by the time they make it to them they can ask asylum and no one wants to take them in so they actually have to go through the trouble of processing them . 
  so even more of a pain in the ass . 
  so borders does n't help the destination countries because they have a legal duty to at least check they are valid asylum seekers and then send them back half a continent away to a country that does n't want them . 
  and transit countries do n't give a flying fuck border or not because it genuinely is not their problem . 
  just like with yugo refugees in the 90s when germany first proposed asylum quotas before schengen was a thing . 
  orban likes pretending hungary is a destination country and he is keeping them out , but he 's pretty much lieing . 
  dublin agreement screws him as a transit country , quotas screw him as a transit country , he wants to be like non-schengen serbia and send them further to austria and not be called up on it . 
  but since he is : '' propaganda , schengen is at fault , entire eu against me ! '', 
  [ here ] ( https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmdfence/986/986we13.htm ) is an detailed report on the dependencies in trident written by a committee in the uk house of lords . 
  democracy is n't a magic solution , please stop making it a magic solution .

  do n't be . 
  they wo n't bother , that 's for certain . 
  and if war breaks out between russia and europe , then we will be in the middle of it regardless . 
  it 's not really a rift . 
  they have some of our land . 
  that 's not the problem , though . 
  most romanians do n't care at all . 
  a few years ago , the un ruled in our favor in a territorial dispute between our countries . 
  it was about a tiny island in the black sea . 
  after that , state propaganda against romania began in their media , bashing us to high heaves . 
  the ukrainians were constantly told that we want our lands back and that our media is constantly attacking ukraine and making territorial claims . 
  of course , that 's was not true at all . 
  ukraine never came up in the news , and romanians do n't really care too much about those territories , we care about moldova . 
  so , there you have it . 
  romanians did n't care much about ukraine . 
  the so-called `` rift '' was on their side , not on ours . 
  probably , but as the president said , moldovan politicians must stop pandering to the kremlin . 
  they must pick a definite stance if they want protection for their country . 
  they are not ready to do that , of course , because they love power . 
  at any rate , whatever might happen , romanians ( the people ) would most surely step up to help . 
  as we did in the transnistrian war , where there were lots of romanian volunteers . 
  if you are interested in romanian views regarding crimea , well , we do n't love the ukrainians but we absolutely hate russia , so there 's that . 
  romania is in favor of eu sanctions, 
  i know how that feels . 
  that 's so damn frustrating . 
  i do n't know what happened , but in the last 1 or 2 years things are getting better in romania . 
  we ranked 1 place above the us in the world press freedom index , the economy is starting to grow nicely and loads of officials were jailed for corruption . 
  i suspect it 's just because the presidential elections are near . 
  nonetheless , i really wish it all plays well for bulgaria in the future . 
  it 's understandable why your government does n't want to impose sanctions on russia if you guys are so dependable on their gas . 
  what i do not understand is why they would want to further the economic relations between your countries . 
  that 's diplomatic suicide . 
  it really raises a red flag . 
  :( i 'm going to cry myself to sleep tonight . 
  yup . 
  that would be reason enough for me to vote no on the referendum . 
  what about your press ? 
  what did they had to say ? 
  did they condemned it or was is like - '' eh , russia , ukraine , crimea , let 's go to sports '' ? 
  haha . 
  it 's much more complicated than that , but yes , that 's the gist of it . 
  :d also , they were not romania since forever , but they were romanians since forever . 
  we speak the same language , we have the same ancestry and we were one country before wwii when the russians annexed moldova . 
  so , yeah , we are bffs . 
  i remember reading that we 'll start extracting in 2018 . 
  do you know , is that correct ? 
  also , it said that it will be enough for us , moldova and some more for exports within the eu . 
  wtf ? 
  no branches in romania ? 
  do n't worry , you probably are . 
  nope . 
  it would never happen . 
  russia would lose their only friendship with a country that matters . 
  never !, 
  the romanian army would march over the prut once again if that were to happen . 
  sadly , both moldova and romania would probably bite the dust , but we would march anyhow for our brothers , do n't doubt that . 
  he warned that if this continues , romania will not intervene militarily in the event of russia `` pulling a crimea '' on moldova . 
  still , romania might not intervene , but romanians will . 
  so romania is in the first place alongside netherlands ? 
  yay !, 
  see ? 
  not affording cars can have good consequences . 
  maybe our politicians are not incompetent after all . 
  maybe they are just green activists . 
  interesting . 
  they seem to be consistent with their poor taste after they get rich , regardless of the country they live in . 
  it was not legal . 
  do n't fool yourself . 
  it was n't at all legitimately . 
  they got rich by stealing from the state after the fall of communism and now after all the scrap metal thing is over , they used the leftover money to build networks of child thieves and beggars in the west so that they can still make money . 
  i 'm not trying to antagonize them , but that 's the reality and they admit to it . 
  i 'm aware , i 'm romanian . 
  but stealing scrap metal only started their businesses . 
  most of them consolidated them by building networks of child beggars and thieves . 
  as you said , nowadays , there is not much left to steal so their money comes from those networks . 
  the unfortunate reality is that the money which were stolen from british , spanish , italian and french pockets by gypsy kids are in the walls of these grotesque houses . 
  really ? 
  i 'm ashamed to admit , but i 'm not that well versed when it comes to that war . 
  i just know what was said in the media . 
  being younger , i was n't that interested at the time in world events . 
  haha . 
  wtf ? 
  no , i was referring to the 2008 war . 
  i know there were not 5000 civilians killed , i was just exaggerating . 
  nope , that part is true . 
  ossetia and abkhazia were occupied by armed rebel forces , so they went in with the guns . 
  afterwards , the russians went in with bigger guns and 5000 civilians were killed . 
  well , first of all , georgia is less important and nato members did n't want to take too many risks because of it . 
  second of all , georgia used the military to regain the territories which were under rebel control and that gave russia more legitimacy - a casus beli if you will . 
  third of all , even though they did nothing , nato was not amused . 
  and if russia has the balls to invade ukraine , they 'll have the balls to do other things . 
  remember , this was not the first time they 've done such a thing ( georgia , moldova , chechnya ) , but this time they went too far . 
  this time it 's too big , there have to be repercussions . 
  nope . 
  georgia is considered to be a part of europe . 
  but that language already exists - it 's english . 
  this is the 21st century , mate . 
  i can translate texts with my phone . 
  i do n't think that language is a major barrier to european co-operation . 
  why would it be ?

  50 years of decaying because of your country have been enough . 
  so countries arming up because they 're scared russia will do something to them is a threat to russia ? 
  it 's all defensive , all in case russia tries to violate our territory , but it helps russian propaganda to paint it as aggression . 
  that username tho . 
  romania 's not mentioned in the article but it 's very important to mention that putin has just recently made threats against the countries hosting missile shields . 
  currently , romania 's the most militarized country in the eu eastern line . 
  can we stop with this flawed logic that if ee are n't net contributors , they are n't paying just as much ? 
  our markets are flooded with we companies . 
  we 're paying just as much . 
  there are a small number of ee companies in we so it evens out . 
  nope . 
  he admitted it a long time ago but recently said he changed his views . 
  mhm . 
  because a blurry vision softly creeping, 
  / u/heinsz7 is right . 
  nato or not , you 'd have to fight russia anyway . 
  you 're not just going to stand and watch as they occupy your country . 
  you go down fighting and if you go down , nato will , hopefully , come and help you up as soon as they can . 
  besides , there are foreign elements and soldier stationed in the eastern countries constantly . 
  nato will have to answer somehow . 
  russia , bosnia , belarus , but no romania ? 
  lol, 
  so what if they break into 2 branches ? 
  i do n't want the party to remain neutral or side with the traditionalists just to keep their scores up . 
  get to work and you 'll evolve over time , people will change or new ones will come and you 'll raise up eventually . 
  do n't be there just for the pictures . 
  some party needs to be against this piece of shit organization and many other bullshit traditional or populist things that idiots want to impose on this country . 
  especially since they 're planning other shit too . 
  it does n't end here . 
  evolving in our current system is n't a matter for months , it 's a matter for years . 
  i know we need a quick solution , but this takes time and people should have thought about that long ago . 
  if this party showed up when we entered the eu and had a good track until today , maybe things would have been different . 
  but we need to stop giving in to populist ideas just for the points . 
  and if they did n't do it for that , if they are truly conservatives that do n't give a shit about people who contribute the same and get less , then they have no place in a party like this , a party that claims is for all . 
  sorry to say , maybe it sounds dramatic , but to me , a secular country that has citizens who contribute the same and yet some get less , are sidelined and have restrictions to ** state services ** then that 's a form of corruption too . 
  it 's one of the many faults we need to fight in this system and unlike the way some think , we can do it at the same time we 're fighting bigger corruption cases . 
  good riddance nicusor dan and i hope someone better takes his place . 
  according to this , we 're the most militarized country in the eastern line ( estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia , hungary , romania and bulgaria ) . 
  moldova is less militarized than us and we 're almost on the same level with belarus . 
  ay ... we 're preparing our sheep well it seems . 
  especially since putin has made another threat recently regarding countries with missile shields . 
  ~ ~ he will never be able to penetrate our sheep shield though . ~ ~ okay that came out wrong . 
  memes those days . 
  who 's laughing now , nigel ? 
  happy children 's day too !, 
  i was angry too at first because i 'm a smoker and it still feels somewhat uncomfortable , but it is what it is . 
  i have n't heard it since middle school . 
  are far more common . 
  who knows what statistics they used though . 
  welcome to the club czechia !, 
  true , but if we think about this whole thing seriously ( which is funny in itself ) , a good side political background would make it all even more surprising . 
  if the russians manage a successful invasion and occupation - maybe . 
  but i guess that 's not what you mean . 
  hahahaha . 
  brother , do not test me . 
  latin blood = latin temperament . 
  nope . 
  glorious latin . 
  or something that derives from a romance language because romance languages are more melodious and easier to actually pronounce . 
  shut up . 
  as is tradition . 
   romania is a huge threat to us . 
  romania , we might have to bomb ya . 
  ours means priest too . 
  on the same note : [ four american black hawk helicopters arrive in romania ] ( https://www.romania-insider.com/black-hawk-helicopters-arrive-romania-2017/ ), 
  ah , thanks . 
  tho ... if there 's putin/obama fanfiction , it is n't totally unreasonable to think that there 's a weird side of the internet that is actually doing this . 
  what ? 
  seriously ? 
   most stories involve a franco-canadian alliance against the usa , but psychologist simon williams warns not to read too much political background in the tales of frantic lovemaking at international summits . 
  this is ... well , something . 
  i read fanfiction casually ( mostly derived from shows , movies or books ) because some fan fiction writers are very good writers . 
  i 've only became aware of political fanfiction when i accidentally stumbled upon a putin/obama piece and was scarred for life although i laughed my way through the whole thing . 
  thought it was crack , for shits and giggles . 
  it was n't . 
  so basically we 're fucked by the psd once again . 
  collective punishment . 
  tories will win anyway . 
   well , he did trade crimea for the near-collapse of his economy and international relations , i agree w that , but maybe he does n't care all that much since he wo n't be the one with no money in his pockets . 
  and somehow , he 'll still manage to make a fuckton of people think that the lack of resources is because the west is evil and wants to hurt the russian people . 
  and we know how people become when they 're put in that sort of situation . 
   in fact he realized his mistake and desperately called merkel for a way out of the situation . 
  i do n't know about this . 
  no one is trying to screw the uk over , chill . 
  that 's just being dramatic . 
  sure thing . 
  do n't worry . 
  i 'm not judging macron here . 
  i 'm just pissed at how long it took for someone to make the slightest step in this direction . 
  some eastern european leaders are known to be more frank about their distaste for putin and russia , but we almost always tries to play it safe . 
  i know . 
  * diplomacy . 
  * but i think the people would n't be upset for things like what macron just did . 
  a leader should be a diplomat , but also not allow the likes of putin to just go on with a pat on the back . 
  maybe . 
  i hope so , but here 's the thing about putin . . he knows all this . 
  he knows his media sells propaganda and all the other shit , but he 's a master at diplomacy . 
  he was trained for hostile situations ever since he was child . 
  i believe almost nothing putin does in these situations is random . 
  he calculates everything very well .

  my point is that if they were refugees , they would 've stopped at turkey . 
  then they would 've stopped at greece . 
  they would 've stopped at hungary . 
  they would have god damn stopped at denmark . 
  but no , they want in germany and sweden because they know there they can grab god by the ankle . 
  have you even been paying attention to any media ? 
  an interviewer asked a `` refugee '' if they 'd go to romania and it was a resounding no . 
  are you currently aware that we do have refugees ? 
  or we had , because they fucking fled . 
  they do n't want to stay here , despite the fact that there is no war , there is food , there is shelter and there is safety . 
  much more safety than there is in syria . 
  but no , we were n't good enough . 
  denmark was n't fucking good enough . 
  either you 're completely daft or we read some seriously different dictionaries when we looked up the word `` refugee '' . 
  it does n't make me look bad or ignorant of international affairs when the people in the international courts are currently pointing out that they are economic migrants . 
  that they are being lied to by human traffickers about what a paradise europe is and showing them edited footage of merkel saying that all are welcome in germany where they 'll get everything . 
  if you are trying to be reasonable and pc , you are sorely mistaken . 
  you are n't arguing with an opinion , you are arguing with facts and real life and real life is unfortunately not on your side right now . 
  ukraine is currently in a war . 
  a balls to the wall actual war where 8000 have died . 
  you know what the ukrainians in the area did ? 
  fled to the zone that is n't in war or fled to their neighbor country of poland , romania and russia . 
  one fucking million of them fled to russia . 
  a few went to germany because they caught wind of their oh so generous refugee aid , but they got turned back . 
  similarly , the actual syrian refugees have fled in millions to turkey ( to name one country ) . 
  the ones coming here are not refugees in any way , shape or form , because if they were , they would n't have done what they did in hungary while hungary was following international law to process them . 
  i will compare it to whatever i god damn want . 
  mexico also has serious troubles , yet no one calls the mexicans going up north `` refugees '' . 
  so why the fuck are we pussyfooting around and fooling ourselves with the muslims ? 
  if they were refugees , they would 've been fucking happy escaping death in any of the countries it took them to reach germany and sweden . 
  no , they 're migrants who want better job prospects and money at best and fucking welfare leeches at worst . 
  do n't kid yourself and pull wool over your eyes , you 're only going to disappoint yourself . 
  `` serious troubles '' = / = war = / = refugees we had and still have serious troubles too , are the million romanians in italy refugees ? 
  you know , the decade after ceausescu got killed was n't exactly a nice time to for romania , what with psd shooting journalists in the street . 
  yeah friend , it was just that one african that i saw and not the thousand nigerians who are flooding into southern italy right now and who count as `` refugees '' . 
  and that 's including the afghans , iraqis and pakis who are throwing their papers in the ocean and say that they 're syrians . 
  yes , they 're all `` refugees '' . 
  these are n't displaced by wars . 
  the actual refugees are in turkey , jordan , lebanon and egypit . 
  i looked at one of the pictures of the `` refugees '' in danemark going to sweden because they did n't like it in denmark and one of them was a subsaharan african , whom i doubt was fleeing from any war as nigeria , ethiopia , or the west coast are n't in conflict . 
  these are opportunists who smelled the chance of money and flooded to it . 
  calling them refugees is the biggest mistake of our times . 
  when we first tried to integrate them 260 years ago , france intervened and told us `` no . 
  they are the last nomad culture of europe . 
  let them be . '', 
  then we tried to integrate them . 
  during communism , because of socialism 's festering need for `` equality '' , ceausescu gave them romanian ids , passports , jobs and appartments in newly built blocs . 
  all for flee . 
  they abandoned the jobs but kept the rest , and now their neighbours ( which were n't built with being ghettos in mind ) are the worst parts of any city . 
  they were also moved in ( or they themselves moved in ) abandoned saxon villages , which were beautiful and well maintained , and completely trashed them . 
  gypsies in romanian schools start from 2 instead 1 in grades and universities are actively offering them scholarships just for being gypsies . 
  it did n't work . 
  then they smelled your weakness and left to profit off your policies . 
  it is you who is now encouraging their behaviour , a behaviour that we tried to stamp out . 
  we factually can not be blamed anymore because it is out of our hands . 
  they are now your problem . 
  when people say `` he has n't done anything '' , it 's mostly in jest and a bit because all he publicly seems to do is talking on facebook , compared to our former president who could n't go a week without shitposting on television and/or doing something that starts a scandal . 
  but from what i hear , he 's cleaning house with the politicians who are n't being arrested and straightening them up so things are running slightly smoother now . 
  must be that german efficiency . 
  and , although i did n't vote for him ( i just drew a dick on my paper using the stamp because i did n't want to vote for anyone but i did n't want my vote to be stolen ) , i do n't dislike someone who 's quiet and when things go nice and smooth without any fanfare . 
  yeah that 's why every european country that has been under muslim rule and in constant contact with muslim hates it . 
  yes because killing assad is not gon na make other powers try to fill a power vacuum like it happened with ghadaffi and saddam . 
  no siree bob . 
  the harder you push the pendulum left , the harder it 'll swing right . 
  which is why i suggest you stop pushing before things get real violent when it will inevitably swing back . 
  because the portuguese are in any position to be criticizing us , huh, 
  tell me in what , way , shape or form is it okay for an european country ( or any country , really ) to have entire no-go areas where policemen and firemen are having rocks thrown at them by immigrants ? 
  tell me , bar a fucking active volcano , in what way , shape , or form is it okay to have places in your country where you , as its ' native , are discouraged from going to . 
  i do n't think we should bring sweden into this if you 're trying to give muslims the benefit of the doubt . 
  hungary is a country that got fucked over hardcore by muslims ( like most of us in the area ) and their opposition of islam is part of their cultural heritage , as it is for us , so it 's completely understandable . 
  and by fucked over hardcore i mean entire areas were wiped out by turkish raids and incursions and it 's not the kind of thing people tend to forget , especially now since the migrants on their doorstep gave them absolutely no reason to think that they are benign or willing to follow the law and the rules . 
  it would be like asking a palestinian to get over netanyahu bombing his kids and accept orthodox jews in his house . 
  and before you go for the knee-jerk response of `` it happened hundreds of years ago so shut the fuck up '' excuse , let me explain to you that this kind of thing is linked to the unseen , deep culture of the area . 
  for example , we ( both romanians and hungarians ) have a popular saying that goes like this : calm down , the turks/tatars are n't invading , which means `` there 's no hurry '' . 
  it is something so basic that even the countryside elderly that did n't go past 4th grade know and it is something ingrained in the nation 's conciousness and culture , and unless you want to destroy it all , rowdy muslims arriving by the thousands is n't gon na sit well with the native population . 
  `` i disapprove of what you say , but i will defend to the death your right to say it '' ring any bells ? 
  i disapprove of a lot of stuff being said and thrown around lately , but at no point did i genuiely want to silence the people saying it even though some statements made me want to reach for a cyanide pill . 
  yeah , i suppose . 
  though i wo n't say no to the bit of national prestige and tourist money , but it 'd be nice if vlad would stop being seen as a bloodthirsty monster and the facts were known and by `` facts '' i do n't mean the american kind of facts where they still romanticize and speculate about stuff . 
  i mean the proper historical facts , and the reason he was hated being that he culled the boyar class that betrayed his father and older brother to the ottomans and that he got used as a scapegoat for hungary 's crusade not going very well . 
  plus the fact that he is n't even our most celebrated ruler . 
  i 'd say he ranks lower than giants like mircea , stefan or mihai , who were much more successful than vlad . 
  well , mihai was until he got assassinated by the austrians . 
  this would n't be the first time we strongarmed major powers into giving us what we wanted . 
  we entered nato by allowing american planes to turn and refuel on our air space while they were bombing belgrade . 
  i think the west underestimates what a sly and clever man the romanian is . 
  this also reminds me of a piece of dialogue from a book of ours : dac\u0103 voi nu m\u0103 vre\u021bi , eu v\u0103 vreu . 
  ( if you do n't want me , i want you ) - spoken by a moldovian prince upon returning to the kingdom and being told by the aristocracy that they do n't want him back . 
  it reminds me that our situation is similarly dogshit to what it was 167 years ago . 
  we 're still at the mercy of foreign powers , we 're still in a lethargic , deathly sleep of apathy and we still have n't proven our worth and pulled our weight . 
  `` decent people '' that throw away food because it is n't halal and stomp and huff that they want to germany . 
  `` decent people '' that write sings such as `` we will destroy this island '' or who do a neck cut sign at a camera in hungary . 
  decent people that shit on trains and squat inside people 's garages and at their doorsteps . 
  the decent syrians have fled to turkey , lebanon and egypt and are waiting for the things to blow over while these are uneducated opportunists that burn their papers so that they ca n't be identified and ca n't be kicked out . 
  and raed arafat is one of many . 
  you ca n't say the actions of one is representant of the many when there are more , more , much more extremist islamists who disdain european culture and values . 
  i can assure you that none of the thousands who flood in europe will amount in their entire lives to what raed arafat did . 
  and on a related note , i do n't recall the million romanian diaspora in italy doing what syrians are doing right now in every country they grace with their presence until they reach germany . 
  remember when our german king refused to cooperate with the german empire ? 
  history has a funny way of repeating .

he did n't break his neck though . 
  iliescu screwed us , but it does n't mean that before him r moldova did n't want to be independent , especially from russia . 
  at least that 's what we learned in history classes . 
  and please , do n't twist your words into sounding like the whole romania wanted what iliescu did . 
  yes , he was corrupted . 
  but he is n't `` us '' . 
  indeed , there 's no eu problem , i was wrong about that . 
  but bad for both ? 
  i am not confirming nor denying that . 
  we need a deep analysis to be sure of that . 
   they were the ones that wanted the separation . 
  they were the ones that wanted their own language . 
  that 's true , indeed . 
   why should we let them back now that they hit rock bottom ? 
  i disagree with this though . 
  also , it 's not like they 're coming back crawling . 
  read about this though , maybe you 'll change a bit of your point of view : http://adevarul.ro/economie/investitii/daca-unim-republica-moldova-iesim-profit-1_534e5d7b0d133766a8d63b3b/index.html the actual problem is now that russia kind of `` forbid '' them and maybe us , from reuniting , so that 's an alarm signal to say at least for both of us . 
  sooo . . apparently not . 
  i was mistaken . 
  for a while . 
  that 's a real concern indeed . 
  but think of it this way : better to have them with us and than against us because russia got to them first . 
  anyway , this is all theoretical . 
  my point is that your comment sounded troll . . ish . 
  if i were a moldavian , i would find it offensive . 
  not really . 
  it 's just unachievable right now . 
  not because we do n't want it , but because r of moldova is not an eu member yet and we actually are n't allowed to reunite with them . 
  even if we wanted to . 
  edit : i was wrong about what i previously said . 
  there 's no law that forbids us a union . 
  do n't troll please . 
  it 's the pro russians who reject that idea from what i learned from a few moldavian friends . 
  yeah what the fuck is happening in portugal ? 
  it was the first thing that catched my eye . 
  what is * that * ? 
   ps : i heard a lot of people around me joking about `` we all are nation traitors and enemies of the russian people '' . 
  like , we 're a `` fifth column '' and that queue was barely moving because the cops had to check the id and make a photo , in order to make it easier to find us in the future . 
  it was weird but funny . 
  wow that 's horrible :( i 'm still very proud of you all for not backing down . 
  no wonder this brainless prime-minister keeps coming and going from turkey . 
  he loves erdogan . 
  yeah , also they have a lot of money to travel other ways , with guns too , not only with a backpack with some pita bread and a few clothes . 
  not if you 're a muslim or coloured , trust me . 
  you should head over to / r/romania and see the racism , xenophobia and islamophobia over there . 
  i remember a few weeks ago , when the threads about immigrants started , you could see comments like : `` shoot them '' , `` they 're gon na bring terrorists '' , `` they 're gon na try to convert us '' . 
  and it ' still going . 
  i 'm ashamed of my fellow romanians who think this way . 
  because it 's bullshit , that 's why . 
  a lot of factories are closing because they 're not turning profit . 
  a lot of their workers even protested because they are out of jobs . 
  mind you , people who had experience . 
  you ca n't assume every refugee will be able to work in it or in a factory . 
  nice logical fallacy you have over there . 
  i think it 's called a slippery slope . 
  maybe you should stop with the ignorance and ad hominem arguments . 
  they already said there are no civilians in there and that they 're doing this as a defensive , not as offensive tactics . 
   like i said , it 's not the rules of reddit , but of life . 
  yeah , what rules ? 
  the rules of getting bombed and not fighting back ? 
   you know that you ca n't fight back without using fuckin ' bombs , right ? 
  oh look , a redditor tells others how to fight back in a war . 
  unbelievable . 
   let 's sent fuckin ' bombs into this motherfck3r country !, 
  ( it does n't matter if some civilian dies , the important thing is that the dikhead got blow up too ) you completely ignored op 's and others ' comments then where he says which site is bombed and why . 
  how about a little bit of knowledge before saying that they bomb civilians ? 
   everybody knows that many armies use civilians as human shields `` oh look , i 'm supporting my statements without having/knowing the whole story . '', 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ajxfl/when_war_comes_to_reddit_rukraina_sends_a_hello/csdag9e http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ajxfl/when_war_comes_to_reddit_rukraina_sends_a_hello/csdf3ue next time , get your context together before assuming stuff and that they 're bombing civilians . 
  and do n't think that anyone is praising war just because . 
  i doubt that many of them even will come back alive or in one piece and they know it . 
  do you think these people want that ? 
  nobody wants that . 
  they have to do it though . 
  they ca n't all flee the country and give in to russia . 
   reddit banned the `` fat people hate '' because it was an incentive to joke around fat people . 
  neah , it 's because they broke the site rules . 
  like you know , harassing people . 
  otherwise , other subreddits like fph would 've been banned too because of the content . 
   the rules of humanity , not reddit . 
  what rule are they actually breaking by posting this ? 
  like someone already said : it becomes even more real when some guys you know from the internet join the army . 
  do you they they wanted to go there instead of browsing reddit in their free time ? 
  do you think they want to kill anyone ? 
  who do you see here that is `` praying for the war '' ? 
  are you serious ? 
  i guess when someone comes in your own home and hits you and throws bombs at you , you just say : `` neah dude , i 'm against war , i wo n't fight back !, 
   it 's not being invaded . 
  yeah , tell that to my ukrainian friends who moved to my country because the city where they lived was destroyed by those invaders . 
  what a fucking joke . 
  and what do you suggest ? 
  that they give up and take it in ? 
  i do n't see how you can avoid a war that 's happening in your country , without your will . 
  what should they do ? 
  just accept being invaded ? 
  it 's called empathy !, 
  `` end in peace '' . 
  what a fucking joke . 
  as if they would n't want that ? 
  are you that oblivious to what 's happening there ? 
  i do n't think so .

  thus chp does n't really lose votes to akp but neither can they break their celing , kurd wo n't vote for chp , it is pointless to try , and their '' left wing '' stances pushes away the '' right wing '' vote , who erdogan swollowed , and formed akp who is a coalition consisting of normal conservative right wing parties to dozens of smaller islamist parties , of various degree of moderates and extremists . 
  held together by erdogan alone , gulen helped but he is gone now . 
  once erdogan dies/leaves the party will implode now chp would be more then ready to make a coalition with either mhp or hdp , but the problem is that you will never , ever , make those 2 sit at the same table . 
  this in my opinion , shows turkeys split in politics , in '' de jure '' and '' de facto '' . 
  turkey on paper is a multiple party parlimentary democracy . 
  like italy for example or germany . 
  the thing though , is that this means coalitions need to be formed to govern , but they ca n't be made because of to different positions and parties . 
  while the opposition can deny akp a majority and even governship , because none will ally with them , neither can they form a governing , majority coalition . 
  but in reality akp acts like in a american 2 party system , where each party has about half the votes , but the opposition ca n't unite , thus akp wins by default . 
  now erdogan wants usa style of presidential power but here i actually am not that worried . 
  in this system , it is erdogan who will campaign , who will ask for votes directly , not akp . 
  akp has never broke 45 % of votes ( similar situation in romania with psd ) , erdogan won his presidential race with 51 % against 2 very weak candidates , who split the vote . 
  turkish elections are free , freer then russia 's and freer then all the muslim world and most of asia , if fraud goes on , it is at the same level it happens in romania , old people getting flour , oil , sugar mostly in rural areas . 
  in a presidential system , especially when someone was in power for so long , elections turn into a refferendum on that person . 
  with many people voting against him rather then for his opponent . 
  people are worried of erdogan imposing such a system , with good reasons , but this system also weakens erdogans greatest asset . 
  the assured victory of akp because of the oppositions failure to form a coalition . 
  if he was smart , he would keep the current system and never have to fear losing . 
  but he wants it all , he wants to decide by himself in a presidential system , but in my opinion , this hurry , this paranoid actions of his , the failure of all his promises . 
  the economy is going down , the truce with pkk is no more , isis attacks , a attempted coup by his formal ally because of their rivalry . 
  all this prove he was wrong , chaos can appear even if he rules . 
  thus erdogan in his attempt for unlimited power may lose it all , in a decisive and humiliating slap in the face from the turkish people . 
  cnn reports 14 dead sadly . 
  i would say these are good articles , to give you a view of the organization . 
  http://english.aawsat.com/2016/07/article55354746/exile-might-derail-erdogans-grand-design http://english.aawsat.com/2016/07/article55354751/turkey-erdogan-wins-first-round-long-fight amir taheri is a pro-democracy , quite '' republican '' though and anti-obama , exiled iranian journalist , he wrote some very good articles about turkey and they are bias-free from what i asked of my turkish friends i truly recomand him , not only on turkey related articles but also his articles on the arab spring/iranian politics ... etc. 
  very well written and more then worth a read , even if you disagree with him on some things , i know i do !, 
  oh , no doubt syria is the main reason putin agreed to this . 
  erdogan may have multiple reasons , but the kurdish issue is without a doubt the main one . 
  what i find '' funny '' , interesting may be the better word though , is that putin , in my opinion , comes out of this looking worse then erdogan . 
  here is this '' strong man '' who does as he pleases , who he alone can fix things , having to welcome someone he insulted , quite harshly , someone whose order killed russian people/citizen and having to accept a half-assed apology , like you said . 
  while erdogan got out of this , looking like he can do anything he wants and not even putin can do anything about it and has to court him/turkey . 
  it will be interesting to see how things evolve , but without a doubt both must feel very week and uncertain if they decided this is their best course of action . 
  ah , how you love to pretend you 're not balkan slovenia ... 
  that was when ceausescu was still '' normal '' . 
  everything changed after his visit to north korea . 
  that 's how you do a coup . . 
  as i thought erdogan is n't really doing a re-alignment but rather tries to play both parts . 
  he says his friendly toward both and against neither , so it is them who have to court him . 
  he is n't going to join putin and abandon nato in my opinion , while both putin and erdogan try to act like this is a show of force , erdogan wants the wests support against the coup and putin wants to show that he can destabilize nato , but the fact that only 6 or so months ago they were sworn enemies and rivals , to me proves that both are weaker then before , or at the very least that is how they feel . 
  it 's not even a right-wing thing honestly , it has to do more with the elections . 
  he 's trying to gather as many votes he can , he said his party will get 20 % in the elections , but that is a pipe dream , if he gets 6-8 % he should count himself lucky . 
  our nationalistic party just lost it 's leader , he passed away , and since then basescu has become more nationalistic , most see it simply as a electoral move . 
  he did n't say anything about these problems , when he was in office and had means to actually do something about it . 
  i have little doubt will discusses the problems with the serbian government when the time comes , and i have even less doubt that serbia will do it 's best . 
  in any case , romania wo n't veto serbia 's eu bid . 
  he 's gone crazy since he left , do n't even pay attention to him . 
  this comes from someone who voted twice for him . 
  and he 's trying to gain prm 's votes , our ultra nationalistic part , now that vadim is dead , so he can boost his electoral percentage by a whooping 3 % ... . 
  told you will get back at you bulgaria ... and western europe ? 
  i find this competition we have absolutely hilarious !, 
  there is even a saying here '' well at least , we 're better then bulgaria '' ... will have you next time !, 
  ah the eternal romanian problem . 
  we bring foreign people to rule us well ( our first king ) , we have competent governing for the first time , in a long , long while . 
  and then our own elected officials and democracy ruins it all ... / s i still hope pnl/usr do well and perhaps udmr/pmp will join them and support ciolos as pm . 
  i would like him to remain independent but i would be ready accept him joining pnl if it means he will lead the party and remain pm . 
  while still not perfect , especially the udmr and pmp part , in my opinion it would still be better then psd/alde and liviu '' i was found guilty , with no right to appeal , for electoral fraud '' dragnea and calin '' i will get arrested soon '' tariceanu . 
  if this fails , i will put all my hopes in dna and that they will arrest most of them . 
  this !, 
  our farmers refuse to forms '' unions '' because they think these are just like those during the communist era , were the state took away their land . 
  it is false of course , in these modern '' unions '' the state plays no role whatsoever . 
  by forming unions , just like you said , the supermarkets have a place they can go and sign contracts , this gives the producer much more negotiating power and eliminates the '' middle man '' . 
  this is what the politicians should do but alas laws in romania are thought out and refined only after they passed ... ... 
  it 's basically the same if a joker would call police and say there is a bomb in the parlament, 
  to be honest , there are quite a lot of people who are against this . 
  my biggest problem is that law is very vague and not really thought out . 
  for example during the winter , romanian producers can simply not fulfill the demand , and we need to import . 
  the law fails to even mention this problem . 
  it could be a good law , all though as a supporter of free-trade i also disagree with it on principle . 
  to me it smells like a classic populist law meant to be introduced right before elections . 
  in my opinion it would be better to help farmers and producers so they could actually fulfill that demand , rather then force it upon the supermarkets . 
  i do n't even know what they 'll do if romanian producers ca n't fulfill all demand , which most admited they ca n't , especially during winter . 
  the only way then to abide this law , would be to have fewer goods in the supermarkets , which no one will like ... edit : another point , our farming relies mostly on the weather , as we lack irigations . 
  so what happens if 1 year we have a '' bad season '' , where will the sm get the goods ? 
  they will have to reduce the number of goods they sell so they can fit the 51 % quota . 
  so i say , how about first , we help farmers get irigations and modern tools , and teach them how farming works in the 21st century , so they can truly fulfill the needs of the supermarkets and the consumer , rather then telling the supermarkets what , and how much , they can buy or not . 
  as much as i detest and dislike our politicians and everything to do with them i really love judicial institutions , especially in the past 3 or so years . 
  i had little doubt those people would be arrested quickly and truth would be revealed . 
  ukraine is a better example in my opinion . 
  i just do n't believe romania could 've fallen into dictatorship , i do not see who could have done it . 
  iliescu is really the only one i can think of but even he lost a election and admited defeat . 
  there was vadim , he could have become president , riding a anti-establishment wave of feeling , but his party could never really have won a majority in parlament . 
  you do n't send us '' a truckton of money '' there are funds we can access if we meet certain requirments . 
  and we are shit at doing that , thus we ca n't access that money , which remains with the eu . 
  most eu funds that we do absorb are used correctly , mostly because it is very , very difficult to steal them . 
  most eu funds are used on infrastructure in small and medium towns , because it 's there is no other way to finance these projects , because the government will never give them that money . 
  or private individuals asking for funds to create their own businesses . 
  most people who do this are those who worked abroad and returned home with experience and knowledge , most are in farming and such . 
  you do n't give us money , and we just burn it away , that is not how things work . 
  there is a fund we can access if we meet certain requirments , and it is this that we are bad at . 
  not to say that if we do n't access that money in a certain time frame , i admit i do not know the exact period , something like 2 or 4 years , we lose access to that money . 
  thank you !, 
  no , we would have turned into ukraine , moldova or belarus . 
  we would have never starting cleaning corruption in that way . 
  not because we did n't want to , just because it would have been almost impossible to do it alone , and i say this with extreme confidence . 
  well , they have to be , to have a message . 
  they can hardly win votes if they are for/against taxes or other such '' normal '' issues . 
  as most likely the biggest 2 parties already established themselves on both sides of the debate . 
  so they need to find something that both parties agree , so they can '' fight '' them on something , most often it is the status quo , right now that is the eu . 
  take ukip for example , now that the eu question is decided they seem to be in a bit of disarey , and i would be very supprised if they would do as well in the next elections , barring any massive change , something like may deciding they wo n't leave the eu , is the only thing i can think of . 
  thanks for the source !,

  i can totally understand that you do n't accept advances from horny idiots . 
  what i 'm telling you is that men , too , must deal with advances from horny female idiots , and yet this problem is almost * always * framed as something that only men do to only women . 
   i ca n't tell if you 're really knowledgable about this or really stupid . 
  myself , on the other hand , am quite convinced that * you * are rather stupid . 
   surely people from turkey are from the turkic ethnic group , something i do n't think people would consider to be white . 
  ` turkic ' is not a real ethnic group . 
  it is a language family . 
  people from turkey are descended primarily from the ancient inhabitants of anatolia , as well as from other populations from the region . 
  they are not very closely related , in an ethnic sense , to the speakers of turkic languages in central asia . 
   i mean , to put it simply , people who are ethnically turkish , there skin is not white . 
  let me put it very simply for you : 1 . nobody 's skin is white . 
  ` white ' people are either pink ( e.g. 
  in northern europe ) or light brown / olive ( e.g. 
  in southern europe ) . 
  turkish people 's skin is just as white as greeks ' , italians ' , romanians ' , or spaniards ' . 
  often , it is whiter . 
  case in point : take a look at the goddam ' picture of the idiot we 're talking about . 
  her skin is white . 
  there is plenty that you 're missing here . 
  you are totally ignorant , you do not realize how ignorant you are , and yet * you * are calling * other * people stupid . 
  you are a horrible person , and i hope this discussion will be the point in your life at which you decide to improve . 
   does turkish count as white ? 
  i totally . 
   if so , why ? 
  what kind of a question is that ? 
  do you think the only whites are brits , dutchmen , and scandinavians ? 
  you said her race made her a minority . 
  i said she 's not a racial minority in the uk , because she 's white . 
  you said she was turkish . 
  i said yes , so she 's white . 
  so as i said , white . 
  i 'm a guy and i was sexually harassed by women more than once . 
  men can ( and often do ) get stalked , harassed , slandered , libelled , assaulted , and raped by women . 
  you probably are n't aware of this , but i 'm sure that 's because you 're so oppressed . 
   nowhere has she claimed that her gender makes her a minority , only her race . 
  but her race is white . 
  it 's her being a white * woman * that allows her to claim she 's oppressed . 
   funny thing is : women are a majority . 
  even funnier thing : by the sjw definition , women are a minority . 
  why ? 
  because they do n't have power . 
  support one falsity with another falsity , wonder why everybody despises you . 
  but it 's not a `` valid '' definition , it 's just a made-up definition that allows racists to say they 're not ` racist . ', 
   being able to actually commit genocide is power . 
  yes , but being able to call for genocide and get away with it - that is also power . 
  today i heard that finland has a minister who claims he ca n't be racist by definition because he 's catholic . 
  maybe sweden . 
  there 's more than one way to be ` left ' and ` right . ', 
  this should make it clear who has all the power in the western world these days . 
  if you can call for genocide with impunity ( even if it 's a ` joke ' ) , then you are in an extraordinary position of power . 
  who said you 'd know ? 
  ( but i think the idea is the secret rules are for the governments . ), 
  i thought roma was from italy . 
   dubstep , drum & bass , rock , pop , coldplay that 's hardly what i call ` relevant culture-wise . ', 
  maybe you mean pop-culture-wise . 
  the anecdote about eating swans may have been made up by the media . 
  on the other hand it is of course true that many are begging or pickpocketing in london . 
   i am a catholic , by definition i can not be racist the sjw movement is morphing into wondrous things . 
  yep , looks like transylvania & banat got more than half of hungary beat . 
  history is interesting . 
  paris has been draining france for centuries . 
  maybe less so nowadays . 
  london is draining the whole planet . 
  it 's probably true , but that does n't mean it 's not misleading in certain ways . 
  pps statistics tell you how much you can buy in * local * goods and services . 
  the average bucharester apparently can buy more local food or taxi rides than the average berliner . 
  but it 's still possible that the average berliner can buy more trips to the baleares than the average bucharester ( do n't know if it 's true , i 'm just saying it 's possible ) . 
   if then , yes . 
  on some markets outside of europe they 're marketed as renaults or as nissans . 
  but they 're not simply renaults assembled in romania , they 're also developed in romania ( although they do reuse some renault components ) . 
  dunno but they have [ dracos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dacian_draco ) to frighten the assholes on the road . 
  it 's also because cars are n't cool anymore . 
  when you have smartphones etc. , cars are boring by comparison . 
  well , yes . 
  but ` kraut ' is an ethnic slur , and a pretty genocidal one when you think about what it means . 
  be mean to the troll , but do n't insult the whole country because of him . 
  nah , we got you all beat . 
  ah romania , an island of beer in a sea of spirits and beer !, 
  why not ? 
  being helpful is a good kind of plan . 
   obviously you do n't have the same rights as i unless you are a german citizen . 
  which he might be . 
   let alone the common currency union romania is not a part of the common currency union . 
  why do you keep bringing up new things that have no relation to your previous claims , instead of defending your previous claims ? 
  maybe that 's what he means with ` apples and oranges . ', 
   do you honestly think this helps the so-called european project ? 
  that is harder to tell , but it might be helping it . 
  keep in mind that the major economic challenge for the eu is to compete with china and other countries that employ what is basically slave labor . 
  under these circumstances , inexpensive workforce from the new eu members is an economic advantage for the entire eu . 
  now does it ` fuel resentment ' among unqualified workers in the western eu ? 
  yes , it does . 
  but those workers would be out of luck anyway . 
  they ca n't compete with china because they 're too expensive for the global market . 
  admitting that i 'm wrong about * what * , you troll ? 
   it 's also not a good thing for the poorer countries because it 's not helping them develop their economies . 
  actually it 's helping them . 
  look at the polish case in 2010 . 
  the reason why poland resisted the crisis so well was because of the money earned by polish workers abroad . 
  the same in romania . 
  we have plenty of rural , uneducated workforce that we did n't know what to do with .

  that is messed up that they 're allowed to do that . 
  stripping the car for parts to lower consumption ? 
  wow . 
  sexism is pretty much the norm , at least with a lot of older and/or uneducated people . 
  it 's not at all rare to see people blaming rape victims for `` wanting it '' or other idiotic reasoning . 
   has n't done shit at home since he has been elected . 
  did n't he send the fiscal code back to the parliament ? 
  yeah . 
  i rescinded my previous application because i believed my being a moderator of / r/circlebroke would cause drama , but after a talk with one of the other mods i kind of regretted doing it , so now i 'm reapplying . 
  like i said , i 'm not sure . 
  but thanks for the interesting discussion . 
  not really , i can just say what i * think * it means - like forcing someone to masturbate or ejaculating on someone without actually having sexual intercourse with them . 
  like i said , i 'm no expert . 
  i 'm just giving my opinion . 
  i edited my comment , it looks to me like the laws between the two countries are superficially similar , which might lead to differences between the two countries in number of reported cases . 
  i honestly have no idea . 
  can you tell me ? 
  edit : ah , i have an idea , i think . 
  the definitions are fairly similar between the two countries , true , with a major caveat - in swedish law , there is a '' is comparable to sexual intercourse '' part . 
  norwegian law has no such clause . 
  at least that 's what i saw on wikipedia , i 'm nowhere near an expert in law . 
  except for the fact that convictions have remained the same since 2005 . 
  it 's just the number of reported cases that 's increased due to changes in legislation . 
  if a woman is raped every day by her husband , 300 new cases will be opened but a single conviction will be made . 
  yes , i corrected my comment . 
  it 's still not considered sexual abuse , though , but [ domestic violence ] ( http://www.dreptonline.ro/legislatie/legea_25_2012_modificare_legea_217_2003_prevenirea_combaterea_violentei_familie.php ), 
  they have one of the most encompassing definitions for sexual abuse , which started expanding to include even [ marital rape since 1965 ] ( http://kunskapsbanken.nck.uu.se/nckkb/nck/publik/fil/visa/197/different ) . 
  for comparison , marital rape was made a crime in romania in 2000 , but is not considered sexual abuse , but domestic violence . 
  since 2005 the definition of rape in sweden has been [ expanded to include many more situations ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19592372 ) that just `` forced vaginal penetration '' . 
  more than that , every single instance of sexual assault is recorded individually - if a woman is raped 3 times by the same person , 3 new cases will be opened instead of 1 containing all them . 
  plus , the swedish police encourages all men and women to report as many cases of sexual assault and , seeing how egalitarian the country is ( i.e. 
  there 's very little `` oh , she was probably asking for it '' mentality ) , it makes sense to see an increase in reported sexual crimes . 
  fire and brimstone coming down from the skies !, 
  rivers and seas boiling !, 
  forty years of darkness !, 
  earthquakes , volcanoes ... 
  the dead rising from the grave !, 
  human sacrifice , dogs and cats living together ... mass hysteria !, 
  `` invasion '' lol go back to stormfront, 
  ok , yeah , i get it . 
  challenging , sure . 
  but not as apocalyptic as a lot of people ( like the comment i replied to initially ) make it out to be . 
  i know . 
  but , i mean , even if all 800k people somehow magically get approved , what will that change ? 
  there 's already plenty of minorities that live in europe with no issues ; increasing their number by 5 % , hell , even by 25 % wo n't have `` huge consequences and affect everybody living in europe '' . 
  do you know how many minorities already live in europe without issue ? 
   this is hardly anything new . 
  we see that all over again . 
  yes , because this same news piece has been posted numerous times already , it 's 2 weeks old by now . 
  too many for what ? 
  even ignoring the fact that most of them will get rejected , what exactly do you think will happen if all 800k get asylum in europe ? 
   huge consequences and its going to affect everybody living in europe . 
  how is that not overreacting ? 
  800k people is less than 0.2 % of the population of europe . 
  you literally started out by saying `` let 's see how many cheap excuses you can come up with . '', 
  you only clarified about meaning `` the government '' after calling me all that and me taking offense in it . 
  in the future , just say what you * actually * mean . 
  take some time to think things through . 
  it 'll do you a lot of good . 
  you called me a selfish prick , a 3 year old child , condescendingly made reference to all the `` aid '' romania gets from eu , and you 're surprised i got annoyed ? 
  i did n't take any position , i simply stated the facts , with references , did n't pass any sort of judgment on anybody . 
  are you trolling me ? 
  8/10 if you 're a troll , you managed to get me nice and riled up . 
  otherwise please just leave me alone . 
  lol so you `` yell '' at me because you disagree with somebody else . 
  gg champ , no wonder so many extremists are gaining traction in this sub , with arrogant , stupid people like you representing the `` humane europeans '' . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  how does any of that make me a `` selfish dick '' ? 
  are you really holding * me * responsible for ... actually , i do n't even know . 
  what ** exactly ** are you accusing me of ? 
  like even the fucking comment you replied to says , i [ want more refugees to come to romania ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jlzph/refugees_do_not_want_to_go_to_romania_romania_is/cuqp1hb?context=1 ) . 
  fuck you , you condescending prick . 
  edit : also , oh yes , the mcv , the `` mechanism '' that eu has shackled us with in order to keep denying romania entrance into schengen , even though we comply with literally all the requirements . 
  double fuck you . 
  how am i being a selfish dick ? 
  i honestly do n't know what you 're referring to . 
  edit :  you know how much money the eu spends to help romania to get rid of their corrupt politicians ? 
  literally 0 , since literally all convictions came from romanian authorities . 
  though i fail to see how this ties in to everything . 
  where are you taking your talking points from ? 
  you sound seriously disjointed . 
  cheap excuses for what ? 
  please no more tabloids , it adds nothing except fodder for extremists .

  oh , no , i know what the gravity gun is , i just meant `` i dunno how many people believe in actual gravity guns in romania '' as opposed to the part that interested me , regarding bioauras and shit . 
  dammit , i 'm trying to talk about actual issues here !, 
  well , i do n't know about gravity guns , i just know that way too many people in romania believe in auras and bioenergies and stupid shit like that . 
   q : what kind of cases do you deal with ? 
   a : almost on a daily basis we get requests to approve yet another `` quantum bio-regulator '' or `` aura corrector . '' christ , is this an eastern european thing ? 
  we have so many of those in romania too , it 's insane . 
  `` do n't go to the doctors , come to quack `` md '' and he 'll cure you by reading your aura and putting good thoughts in your bioenergies ! '', 
  what 's sad is that so many people believe that shit . 
  who ? 
  i know , i agree with all your points , i was just saying how a lot of people think over here with various levels of seriousness . 
  hell , during the presidential campaign the losing candidate kept hinting that klaus johannis would `` sell our country to the germans '' because he is ethnically german , and the general reaction to that was `` hah we should hope so , at least germany knows what it 's doing '' . 
  oh , is that what refugees are doing ? 
  they 're literally stealing your spot ? 
  whenever a refugee is accepted , a native is kicked out ? 
  i think both ; more money from germany * and * german meddling in internal politics , as a lot of people over here have completely lost faith in the local politicians .

  of course they were silent , they 're part of that shitty community as well . 
  i 'm from transylvania , not germoney . 
   if i understand it correctly , romania had no infrastructure ( or an incredibly shitty one ) and you guys had to build it from scratch , but since you built it late optic fibres were around and were relatively common nope , that 's very far from what actually happened . 
  what happened was that in the early 2000s , when the internet pretty much meant dial-up using romtelecom 's infrastructure , taxed by the hour and expensive as fuck , geeks started building neighborhood lans . 
  at first , they were solely for gaming and file sharing , but then they realised they could offer much cheaper internet than romtelecom and its partners , because they would only have to get one internet line which could be used by all the people served by the lan . 
  in the mid 2000s , rds started aggressively buying all these neighborhood lans which by the time covered pretty much every city in the country . 
  so for them , it was only a matter of connecting those neighborhood lans to their data centers which was way cheaper than building their infrastructure from scratch . 
  using this strategy , rds grew exponentially and competitors found themselves in a situation where they simply had to keep up with rds ( most of them failed miserably , including romtelecom ) . 
  rds has since updated most of that infrastructure , but it was easy for them because by the time they needed to upgrade the infrastructure they already made a shit-ton of money and fiber became available from chinese manufacturers on the cheap . 
  so , to sum it up , the reason romania has such fast internet is : 1 . 
  the lack of regulation which allowed really small companies to set up neighbourhood lans ( i doubt this would have been possible in most other countries where you would have needed to get a shit-ton of approvals ) 2 . 
  the fact that the government decided to drop romtelecom 's monopoly on communication infrastructure , which made it possible for a company like rds to exist in the first place . 
   there 's also our idiot government selling our state telecommunications company ( complete with the infrastructure ) to dt with a guarantee of a 5 year monopoly . 
  so , this is your problem right there . 
  drop telekom 's monopoly , deregulate and you 'll have affordable 1 gbps connections within a couple of years . 
  if you maintain telekom 's monopoly , they will simply have no incentive to upgrade it , as other isps ca n't install their own to compete , so people would still be forced to use telekom , wether directly or through another isp which has to use telekom 's infrastructure . 
  we have deutsche telekom in romania as well , [ but their speeds are a lot better ] ( https://www.telekom.ro/fix/net-1-gbps.html ) ( although i agree with your point that they 're a bunch of cunts ) . 
  i 'm not german , look at my flair closely ( or hover over it ) . 
  what the hell ? 
  heck , [ even moldova ( which is the poorest country in europe ) has better internet speeds ] ( http://www.moldtelecom.md/persons/internet/planuri_tarifare ) , what the hell is wrong with your isps ? 
  it 's not like croatia is a huge , sparsely populated country to make it expensive to run fiber ... 
  wtf is vdsl , we never had that in romania , we jumped from adsl straight to fiber . 
  you talk about 100 mbps like it 's something , here we have 300 mbps for $ 6 per month and 1 gbps for $ 10/month ( it used to be $ 12 , but they 've made it cheaper now ) . 
  also , you may have 100 mbps download , but what 's your upload speed ? 
  it 's not that cool when you have to wait 3 hours to upload a video on youtube . 
  adsl in 2016 ? 
  damn croatia , bring your internets up to date . 
  until you a realise in the end it 's probably going to be more like 80 instead of 80.000 actually getting deported . 
   if you carry a can of hairspray and the police are of the opinion that you 're carrying that hairspray for the purpose of using it as a weapon , you 've committed a crime . 
  * western europeans, 
  source ? 
  imf estimates 2.6 % growth in the czech republic for 2016 . 
  no , they 're doing this because renzi is scared of `` offending '' the primitive fucks with deep pockets . 
  they did the exact same thing in october when some sheikh from the emirates visited . 
  putin being full of shit ? 
  is this something new ? 
   its the new `` staatsschutzgesetz '' now they only need to bring back the schutzstaffel and they 've gone full circle . 
  the primary reason should be the only one that matters , there should be a clear distinction between legitimate refugees - those who would be in immediate mortal danger if they remained in their country ( i.e. 
  yazidis ) and those who think `` i want to have a better life . 
  oh , and maybe feel more secure ... '' . 
  while i do agree that living in poverty is quite sad , the eu is no paradise , we have limited resources and enough poor people of our own , no need to take in new ones . 
  - only accept those refugees who can prove they were immediate mortal danger in their home country . 
  only allow them to request asylum at embassies in third countries , so that they wo n't have any excuse for entering the eu illegally . 
  - once a refugee claim has been solved and the refugee deemed legitimate , bring them to europe , but monitor them for at least 2 years . 
  if they fail to integrate within that timeframe , deport them . 
  if they commit any serious crime , deport them and hold the people monitoring them responsible . 
  - rejected asylum seekers should not be allowed to enter the eu under any circumstances for at least 20 years . 
  - extremely tight border security , fences , walls , flir cameras , drones , a pan european coast guard , you name it !, 
  if it helps monitor/secure the border , use it !, 
  - military operations to arrest/kill the migrant smugglers in north africa . 
  in romania we have dozens of kids who drown every summer . 
  sad ? 
  yes . 
  shocking ? 
  not really . 
  however , we do n't have many cases of teenagers murdering social workers and i 'm definitely not looking forward to this shit coming to my country . 
  but as i 've said , even if he is a textbook opportunist , he ca n't afford to turn his back on the devil after he made a deal with it . 
  i 'm more than certain that russia could `` leak '' more than enough evidence to end dodon political career and send him to prison . 
  gandon is the most despicable , spineless and subservient politician i 've ever seen . 
  he is russia 's puppet , in fact i would n't be surprised if he was on the fsb 's payroll . 
  even if he is n't fsb , the fsb likely has enough shit on him that if he ever was to turn on russia , they could end his political career and put his ass behind bars for at least 10 years . 
  just yesterday , the guy had one of his lackeys pay a random dude $ 100 to say on tv that he was paid by usatyi to come to the protests ( the guy was swiftly captured by usatyi 's henchmen and admitted that he was indeed paid by dodons men to say he was paid by usatyi ) . 
  in a civilized country , that alone would result in prison . 
  so even if dodon softens his anti-eu tune , it will be because russia would let him do it . 
  edit : apparently , usatyi is now backpedaling and saying he is still bff with dodon . 
  what a fucked up country this is !, 
  the fuck ? 
  this is exactly why i have a copy of the constitution in my home , if police ever visited me to ask me to remove a facebook/twitter post , i would shove it in their faces and tell them they can go sodomize themselves . 
  yeah , of course it means between each other , otherwise , the person who is over 14 will be criminally responsible ( again , this is from a technical perspective , it does n't necessarily mean a prosecutor would charge a 14 year old for having sex with a 13 year old ) . 
  gold is 17 , you are reading it wrong . 
  cyan = 14 light blue = 15 dark blue = 16 gold = 17 green = 18, 
   a lot of the time those 14-15 year olds approach the adults not the other way around , just saying . 
  if a 14 year old made sexual advances towards me it would n't turn me on , but rather make me wonder what kind of lousy ass parents she might have . 
  a 14 year old might not realise it 's wrong to have sex with an adult ( or rather have sex , period ) , but an adult should know that unless they 're retarded or something . 
   plus ... a 25 year old dating a 15 year old is 1 ) not illegal and 2 ) seems creepy sure until you realize a 30 year old dating a 20 year old is not that weird . 
  by your logic , if it 's ok for a 30 year to have sex with a 20 year old , then it should also be ok for a 15 year old to have sex with a 5 year old , right ? 
  a 30 year old dating a 20 year old are two adults dating , a 25 year old dating a 15 year old is an adult dating a teenager , it 's a big difference . 
  the map is colored correctly , look again . 
  i was talking specifically when one of the partners is a minor . 
  john cleese 's wife is pretty close to her bloody menopause , so it does n't exactly apply in that case . 
  you are correct , pedophilia is n't a legal term , there 's no such thing as people being convicted of pedophilia - people are convicted of having sex with underage children , or possession/distribution of child pornography , not for being pedophiles . 
   if you are attracted to a well developed 14 year old ( the kind , that does not look like a child , but a woman ) although i partly agree with you ( i.e. 
  that someone perfectly normal might feel sexually attracted to a 14 year old because she looks older ) , age of consent is n't about how one looks , but rather how one thinks . 
  i was personally sexually abused when i was 11 by my 17 year old neighbour . 
  i did n't actually realise it at the time , i actually thought it was cool because she was hot , but it really fucked up my mental development and i still have some lingering effects from it . 
  i think 15 is the perfect age of consent , as long as there 's no significant age difference between partners , because it 's the age at which you can have sex without being fucked up for the rest of your life . 
   no significant difference in physical and mental developement that 's very vague , i 've seen 15 year olds who look like they 're 19 and 25 years olds who have the mentality of 15 year olds . 
  in romania , there 's no such thing as criminal responsibility if you are under 14 , so technically two 13 year olds can have sex without any consequences even though it 's illegal ( although in some cases , the parents might be held responsible , but that 's rare ) . 
  * pedo city, 
   i 'd make it 18 because current situation is heavily abused by old dudes ( when i say old i mean even up to 60 ) . 
  that could be easily solved by setting a maximum age difference in the case that one of the partners is a minor , like say 5 years , so that it would be legal for someone who is 21 to have sex with a someone who is 16 , but it would be illegal for someone who is 40 to do the same . 
  setting the age of consent at 18 is just unrealistic and would make criminals out of ordinary kids as most people i know lost their virginity when they were 15-16 . 
  this is weird , last year they said [ some russian guy was to going to buy all the mcdonald 's restaurants in romania ] ( http://www.economica.net/bomba-mcdonald-s-romania-se-vinde-rusilor-toate-restaurantele-vor-fi-francizate_98565.html ) . 
  maybe he changed his mind ? 
  anyway , i do n't think mcdonald 's will have a great future in romania , they were cool back in the 90s and 2000s , but now the fast food market has been conquered by turkish/middle eastern fast foods , the d\u00f6ner kebab and shawarma being much more popular than mcdonald 's burgers . 
  maia sandu wo n't be able to do jack shit if dodon and usatyi manage to win a majority . 
  it will be the funeral of the moldovan democracy , which has been constantly on life support since the country became independent . 
  the pro-russian parties were really close to getting a majority in the last elections , this time they will probably win a definitive majority , and they will likely immediately start back-pedalling on whatever minor advances were made to bring moldova closer to the eu . 
  moldova will probably never be able to have a future as an independent country , since there 's no such thing as a `` moldovan identity '' and the population is split in roughly half between pro-russians and pro-west . 
  yes , it is in everyone 's interest that plahotniuc goes , the problem is how exactly he 's gon na go down and who will fill the gap .

  everything was rationed . 
  food , electricity , heating , ( even car use ) . 
  everything went to export to pay for the loans taken to industrialise the country . 
  there was a huge black market . 
  nobody trusted the state , everybody was stealing from the state to survive . 
  make no mistake , although people were chanting `` freedom ! '', 
  they really meant food . 
  i was 6 at the revolution . 
  i never tasted bananas or oranges until i was 8 . 
  eastern germany had a higher standard of living because it was historically richer than the rest of the ee . 
  communism was a global catastrophe that has long reaching effects in these societies even today . 
  buy local . 
  fuck the capitalists pigs !, 
  eastern europeans are fucking drama queens when it comes to their countries . 
  take any from any country push him a little and he 's going to start complaining about his country , compare it to global top 5 economies and most developed states unfavorably . 
  when shit get 's a little better and they lose arguments there 's always something else bad to say . 
  at the same time , if any foreigner talks shit about the same countries they fiercely take offence . 
  if actually there is something nice about the country , then that thing is the greatest thing ever . 
  easterners ca n't stand being average . 
  it 's a search of identity and a love / hate relationship with what were in most case ( some still are ) abusive states . 
  not only we 're economic partners , besides germany which is number one for both countries , we 're no 2 , to each other . 
  economic partners is an understatement . 
  we 're siamese economies . 
  as it should be . 
  it is shocking how many things and aspects of our modern lifes we owe to the romans and greeks . 
  the whole western civilization is just a grandchild of the roman empire . 
  yes but the libyan army leans on cold hard cash . 
  especially higher ranks . 
  he looks like he shook the hand of a train . 
  but seriously . 
  wo n't north macedonia suit both parties ? 
  be `` deeply concerned '', 
  and they 'll loose said refferendum as iohannis is riding on huge popularity these days and psd allready pissed of a lot of people with trying to legalise corruption and sacking it 's own government . 
  i think first of all you identify the true problem and name it . 
  a big chunk of ee are living in postcommunist kleptocratic states or postcommunist mafia states . 
  the rise in nationalism , authoritarianism , puritanism are just reflexes of these regimes in times when they feel threatened . 
  that 's why the anticorruption drive in romania , ehich has become the poster state in this matter , transcedes it 's border and has an impact in the whole area . 
  how else can one achieve god 's plan without tools like these at hand ? 
  maybe that 's why . 
  i see everyone in the east throwing around the name of their countries . 
  bitches please !, 
  there is only one crown and we got that motherfucker locked !, 
  if the cards stack up right . 
  do you think that will happen in our lifetimes ? 
  nope . 
  uk is in a different context . 
  uk is in the mindset that they are being leeched by ee . 
  that they are rich smart and mighty and europeans are just ruining their game . 
  for this to work we would need to turn the tables around and we both know ee is n't going to be richer than we in our lifetimes . 
  no chance . 
  ee countries export double digits of their gdp to we . 
  some more than 50 % . 
  it would be catastrophical to get out . 
  so are these filthy gullenists in jail yet ? 
  all that was said is the uk wo n't get special treatement . 
  the eu wo n't bend the laws to favor it . 
  i suspect brits to be autistic . 
  it has been repeated at nauseaum . 
  single market = free movement !, 
  you do n't want free movement that 's fine . 
  you can get a different deal . 
  but do n't act like somebody pushes something down your throats . 
  no drama here . 
  just normal eu business and a calm visit . 
  carry on . 
  like transnistria ? 
  russians have a way of clenching to everything they touch . 
  i think crimea is gone but i 'd be really happy to see donbass solved in a decade or two . 
  you say but you ca n't , we 're all born cynical bastards in this part of the world  ) but it 's ok , it keeps the head doctor away . 
  do n't worry , your attitude , word per word can be heard in the entire area , from bucharest to kiev , sofia , zagreb and chisinau and so on . 
  take a regular dude from anywhere in these places and he 's going to swear on his mother that his country is the shittiest and his people are the worst . 
  it 's like we ca n't stand to be average , we either need to be the best or the worst  ), 
  maybe you do n't realise it but if it were n't for the eu we would n't have managed to become the regional leader in anti corruption . 
  of all it 's defects the eu established the legal framework and the institutions for this to happen and persisted in guiding us towards the right path . 
  yes . 
  us too . 
  i could argue we take that title . 
  we 're misery bros !, 
   ) one a more serious note our cultures are actually really close , we have more or less the same mentality and outlook , we 're orthodox , we never had any major conflicts , we were allies in a lot of wars and against the ottomans for a long time , we share a decent part of our cuisine , we make plum brandy , we share the same kind of humor and we usually get along very well wherever and whenever we meet . 
  sure , there are fucktards everywhere and it sure seems the barrell cracked in this part of world more than in others but both countries have a lot of cool folks too . 
  fucking smash that shit serbros !, 
  hello sir , do you lie , give and take bribe ? 
  so storm in a tea cup basically . 
  i thought ~ ~ robots ~ ~ non organic persons could not hold office . 
  when was the law passed ? 
  the brits will foam at the mouth with robots taking their jobs left and right . 
  i mean it 's one thing to negociate with gay nazies but gay nazy robots . . 
  they 're fucked !, 
  actually offshoot brands of french manufacturers like dacia are having wild success with basic , functional and practical budget cars . 
  renault is the modern age volkswagen . 
  what putin says is not what putin thinks . 
  it 's beautiful and timeless . 
  a little backstory on our single arrest . 
  it was a troubled young man with probable mental problems , white as bread , no muslim relatives , never traveled to any muslim countries who converted to the one true religion by himself and wanted to wage jihad on the non believers of his small town . 
  i prefer this one . 
  i think it depicts the place more . . accurately . 
  i 'm hoping some of the states in ee become net contributors in a decade or two . 
  that is the most stupid way to form a government . 
  her days are numbered . 
  romania , steady as a rock in a sea of slavs .

  flynn now makes semi-regular appearances on rt as an analyst , in which he often argues that the u.s. and russia should be working more closely together on issues like fighting isil and ending syria 's civil war . 
  `` russia has its own national security strategy , and we have to respect that , '' he said in one recent appearance . 
  `` and we have to try to figure out : how do we combine the united states ' national security strategy along with russia 's national security strategy , despite all the challenges that we face ? '', 
  well , i mean , you send them to the middle east all the time . 
  yeah . 
  i actually wanted to mention in my previous comment that it would be nice to have a president who 's name even trump ca n't ignore . 
  juncker has power though . 
  he just is n't as influencial because we 're not a federation . 
  imagine everyone going through the pain of learning latin just to communicate with us because we 'd be like the french who refuse to speak english . 
  hahaha . 
  but ... but ... you 're leaving . 
  :( and trump like the uk anyway so you guys are fine . 
  even so , scotland must come back to us . 
  it voted remain . 
  rule i : - everyone must start speaking fluent latin . 
  sounds pretty badass . 
  * calls germany *, 
   well , it 's easier to push around a series of individual european nations than it is to strike a deal with a collective of nations . 
  it 's hard to say how coherent his plans actually are . 
  true , but i 'm afraid a closer union is unlikely at this stage , even after such worrying comments . 
  the least i can do is hope netherlands and france chills . 
  and some of us in the east are upping our defense , but apparently trump does n't care anymore because nato is `` obsolete '' . 
  no , but they 're less impulsive and prefer to do politics rather than dick waving . 
  that name is horrible tho . 
  but not everything is done by trump , is it ? 
  there are some people with more than two brain cells around him . 
  will the us really risk putting pressure on a economically important market such the eu ? 
  i mean ... 
  i 'm not expecting good things from him , but there must be someone with at least a bit of common sense who can slap him across the head . 
  well , did n't most republicans hate him ? 
   apparently trump does n't know who jean-claude juncker is . 
  the face palms never stop with trump , do they ? 
  europe can not afford to lose us just yet , but i do hope we become as independent from us as possible . 
  not to spite the us , but for our own good . 
  that being said , many countries do n't feel the need to up their defense . 
  they do n't feel threatened . 
  and here i thought he would chill . 
  we ca n't afford to have that much instability around us . 
  then again , he * is * surrounded by some sane people so that 's good . 
  most germans knew , most germans let it happen . 
  even germans themselves will tell you that . 
  hello there , latvia !, 
  in cats we trust . 
  trust . 
  one . 
  no , it is n't . 
  laws like these have been in place for a long time . 
  some european countries deem the promoting of the fascist ideology that killed millions of people as unacceptable . 
  and it is . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're from europe , but if you 're not , it is hard to grasp the weight of what that ideology did to europe . 
  theoretically in romania the law states that * promoting the culture of persons guilty of committing a crime against peace and humanity or promoting fascist , racist or xenophobic ideology , through propaganda , committed by any means , in public , is punishable by imprisonment from 6 months to 5 years and the loss of certain rights . 
  yes , but a lot of them are descendants of the roma people who came from india . 
   the romani originated in northern india and arrived in mid-west asia , and europe around 1,000 years ago . 
  we may be corrupt , but we 're not a dictatorship on top of that . 
  i know we are , but nobody usually refers to romania as southeastern . 
  just eastern . 
   of course , just as west shits on us to feel better about their ill-gained riches . 
  ce should know better than to do the same thing to us . 
   but that 's okay , you can always shit on middle east  nah , that also seems ce 's job , what with hungary and poland . 
   probably not , eastern europe is also belarus and ukraine , and perhaps moldova , romania and bulgaria . 
  i remember when you were saying that you ca n't be an easterner because you have nothing in common with moldova . 
  what the do romania and belarus/russia have in common ? 
  not that it bothers me that you grouped us together , but i want to see your rhetoric applied elsewhere than just on eesti . 
  yeah , that 's certainly the only reason . 
   point is . . be whatever , but you central europeans , or whatever you like to call yourselves , have a habit of shitting on us eastern europeans so you can feel better about yourselves and look better in front of westerners . 
  and it gets very old , very fast . 
   glorious shit westerns say . 
  this . 
  and not just that . 
  central europeans , or whatever , perpetuate the idea that `` hey , we 're not yucky eastern europoors , we 're so much better '' . 
  and all i can do is think : fuck off , you whine about stigma , but you have no problem throwing it all on us . 
  we ca n't rub off our `` eastern-ness '' by saying we 're central europe , we 'll always live with these stereotypes and with the xenophobia , you could not be a dick and empathize as you know what it 's like . 
   also true , thats why i love when poland is put as central on maps why ? 
  simply because of the geography or because you have some preconceptions about ee that you need to run away from and not be associated with ? 
  which in turn affects eastern europeans as you too enforce the idea that we 're `` yuck '' . 
  we do . 
  it 's central europeans that have something to prove , god knows what . 
  really . 
  turkey can call other countries shitty ? 
  lol, 
  i think he was late to pay their salaries and it probably was n't the first time so he got mad and said they should be grateful because other workers at other factories get their salaries 2 months late . 
  eh some germans do , but i think germans view us more positively than other western europeans . 
  you 're lucky then . 
  than again we 're doing worse than venezuela , a dictatorship . 
  i have higher education and a job . 
  where 's my 1,5 k ???? 
   carabinieri there are stories about these guys . . 
  i think at this point it 's about damage control . 
  for example , did n't scientists say recently that we 've passed 400ppm carbon dioxide threshold and that there 's no going back ? 
  the weather is already fucked . 
  and it 'll only get worse . 
  take 15 degrees from our 40 summers . 
  now i can finally ~ b r e a t h e ~ . 
  they did not just raise their arm , they made a sign that symbolizes a regime and its atrocities . 
  this song is so emotional for me . 
   and damp windy cold winter days ... ah , the `` good '' old -10 winter days , full of snow and ice . 
  i need to move to moderate ireland asap . 
  hello , sir , what level of hell is this ? 
  believe me , it is horrible . 
  what the heck this is completely unfair .

  there are so many complicated things about a possible unification . 
  and if there was a referendum in moldova , i 'm not sure it 'll pass . 
  besides , their president is basically a nutjob and he 's pumping anti romanian propaganda all the time . 
  i understand your point , but you rarely see anyone protesting putin . 
  i try my best to give the benefit of the doubt , but most russians , with few exceptions , support putin in one way or another . 
  moldova too . 
   and they always seem to come from the baltics and eastern europeans for some reason . 
  * always * . 
  lol . 
  alright , buddy . 
  i 've seen such comments from swedes , finns , french , british , germans , italians , spanish , greeks , dutch . . you name it . 
  it 's not just eastern europeans or baltics . 
  and it 's certainly not `` always '' . 
  you lot have a boner for blaming everything on the eastern europeans . 
  i think 2017 will be a shitshow politics wise because this new government is full of incompetents . 
  and so is the parliament . 
  unfortunately , it will undo some of our progress . 
  i do n't know what you consider pretty dark , but i do n't think that the majority of non-roma romanians are as dark as you think . 
  for example , i 'm pretty goddamn white . 
  not the rosy kind that can not tan , but pretty close . 
  i 'm allergic to sunlight now so it 's different , but when i was a child , i could tan . 
  the only things that are n't `` white '' about me are the color of my hair and eyes . 
  brown for both . 
  you have to keep in mind that our country has an opening to the black sea so loads of people go there during summer . 
  you also have to know what that kind of sentence implies , considering that being a fair skinned , blue eyed doll means being beautiful by western european standards , while the rest is `` meh '' . 
  so yeah , maybe you think i 'm `` so white for a romanian '' or `` not white enough '' , but maybe keep it to yourself when you meet a romanian . 
  it 's only polite . 
  haha !, 
  now you 're `` exotic '' in your own country !, 
  hahaha !, 
  great story !, 
  glad you left him talk himself into a hole . 
  people mistake romanians ' ethnicity rather than nationality . 
  some of my countrymen have heard comments such as `` wow . 
  you 're so white for a romanian . '', 
  and similar things . 
  i do n't think that they are selfish for these reasons . 
  i think poland and hungary are a bit selfish because they have been given opportunities for a better future and instead chose populists . 
  i know populists just won the election in romania , so i 'm not saying we 're better , but our populists at least do n't create problems for the eu . 
  i 'm not saying this out of spite , the way some westerners do , i 'm saying this because it 's sad seeing these countries , rated better than romania , still falling for populists . 
  anyway . 
  what i dislike about the netherlands is that my country has fulfilled the schengen criteria for years , but they 're so opposed to us being in schengen . 
  some dutch people say it 's because of roma people , but that 's bullshit because whoever wanted to leave , already left . 
  schengen mainly affects the movement of goods . 
  good info !, 
  thank you very much !, 
  isis here . 
  we have n't entered 2017 yet , but happy new year !, 
  thank you for the info !, 
  is `` guero '' used ? 
  is it a neutral word ? 
  as in the meaning ( insult or not ) changes with the intention ? 
  another reason why europe is so great . 
  nope . 
  we do n't . 
  we 're the best . 
  now bugger off . 
  i love how your whole discourse is based on `` everyone else ? 
  atrocities . 
  ( you probably do n't even know what atrocity means if you use it so lightly . ), 
  those guys do n't represent us as if their money does n't come from hungary and the likes of jobbik . 
  [ x ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzvczfmxexc&amp;t=123s ) . 
  cc for subtitles . 
  they also go hand in hand with the russians , claiming that taking crimea was the right thing to do . 
  i would n't talk about assimilation if i were you . 
  we both know who gets the short end of the stick here . 
  even serbia banned some of your countrymen for being dicks about their land . 
  why ? 
  because you do not get to fuck up peace just because you have a history boner that wo n't go down . 
   ... as in literally every democratic country . 
  they get in , because they pass the vote limit . 
  nothing to see here . 
  so where are they shit on then ? 
  hmm ? 
   just a tiny episode about this : your embassy in australia invited our embassy , and the invite had a picture which shows the `` glorious '' romanian army marching on the streets of our capitol city . 
  it caused a major scandal , and though it was a harsh diplomatic move from the fm 's side , this is one of the few cases i would have done the same as him . 
  source ? 
  i do n't recall this . 
   we do n't have romanian , or pretty much any minority within our borders ( ecept a few , just ask the serbs in budapest , they love it here ) ah , yes , the ah empire was also known for having `` no minorities '' . 
    each and every one of our diplomatic actions is a reaction to atrocities others commit , spoken like a true nationalist . 
  senselessly . 
  thank you for making sure to repeat several times that our national day is `` shit '' . 
  okay , i get it . 
  you do you , hungary . 
  just try your best to stir as little * shit * as you can . 
  we 'd like to leave in a peaceful union . 
  do you realize your politicians are using those people for votes ? 
  and not just this , they are spreading anti romanian propaganda . 
  our government shits on them ? 
  lol . 
  do you even know what you 're talking about ? 
  the hungarian minority have the right to education in their mother language , including a university , they have a party representing them in the parliament , they get public services in their language , etc. 
   and inviting hungarian politicians to your trianon-celebrations is pretty much a dick move if you ask me , just to mention the most recent diplomatic stir . 
  it 's the normal thing to do . 
  that 's what diplomatic relationships are for . 
  everyone is invited to our national day . 
  even though hungarian nationalists tried to blow up people on our national day once . 
  and worse than simply not attending is that your fm * ordered * everyone not to go . 
  is this why you 're in the european union ? 
  is this hungary 's response to european union values ?

  democracy is an illusion . 
   i 'd like to see what you 'd do in his place , with russian tanks pouring over your borders . 
  he screwed up , because he tried to take back abkhazia and south ossetia , despite knowing that russia would n't stand by . 
  no one likes russia , but he put his people and country in danger of total destruction . 
  what the hell was he thinking , anyway ? 
  if russia is your neighbor , you do n't act macho if you do n't have any leverage . 
  georgia had zero leverage over russia . 
  that 's actually what mark twain said `` if voting made any difference they would n't let us do it . '', 
  i remember a romanian oligarch quoting him last year : `` if your vote mattered , we would n't let you vote . '', 
  that 's actually a good idea . 
  so , has syriza changed anything since they 've been in power ? 
  us and the bulgarians , bff . 
  also , what 's up with serbia , montenegro and macedonia ? 
  why so lonely ? 
   hmm i have same bday with hoffman fuck , i thought it was albert hoffman . 
  that would have made me really proud . 
  naturalized american born in the croatian part of austria-hungary from serbian parents of istro-romanian descent . 
  good enough ? 
  everyone satisfied ? 
   she already promised a referendum on reintroducing the death penalty . 
  well , that escalated quickly . 
  i thought europeans were over this already . 
  but he is only known for an epic screw-up . 
  so probably not the best example . 
  captain america was a very successful high budget film and stan was in a main role , so he 's a pretty good example . 
  i 'm pretty sure he 's better known globally than inna or alexandra stan . 
  he 's also only 32 , so he has a lot of time to become even more famous than he already is . 
  no , lol , sebastian stan was born in constan\u021ba , which is also the birthplace for alexandra stan ( coincidence ??? 
  ) , and inna ( she was n't actually born in the city of constan\u021ba , but in the constan\u021ba county ) . 
  yeah , smells like bullshit tbh . 
  maybe they 're judging by official north korean statistics . 
  why would russians want to immigrate to ukraine , it 's much poorer than russia ... oh , wait ... 
  i do n't think italy is that popular with romanians nowadays . 
  everyone i know wants to go to britain nowadays . 
  stalin ? 
  does n't really change the fact she was born there , but ok , milla jovovich then . 
  also , i do n't think the opinion of some random , extremist mp is reflective of the entire country . 
  liam neeson - known for schindler 's list , star wars and a whole bunch of other movies colin farell - total recall pierce brosnan - james bond gabriel byrne - the usual suspects saoirse ronan - atonement , city of ember , the lovely bones jack gleeson - game of thrones, 
  liam neeson , colin farell , pierce brosnan , gabriel byrne , saoirse ronan , jack gleeson , just to name a few . 
  did you even [ captain america ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/captain_america:_the_first_avenger ) ? 
  not exactly , maybe contemporary , but it would be more interesting if we talk about people that not everyone already knows were born in x country . 
  for example everyone know ( or at least should ) that van gogh , rembrandt were born in the netherlands , mozart and hitler in austria , bach and beethoven in germany etc. 
  because there 's a shit ton of famous irish people and everyone knows they 're irish . 
  or stanley kubrick and monica lewinsky . 
  nikola tesla is a serb with istro-romanian ancestry born in croatia . 
  make your pick . 
   the current prezident of brazil is a ethnically bulgarian woman . 
  it does n't count though as she was not born in bulgaria and is only partly bulgarian . 
  in a similar manner , one could claim natalie portman is romanian . 
  i assume you are croatian ? 
  having a large economy and being economically developed are two very different things . 
  china and india also have very large economies , yet it does n't change the fact that they 're both very far away from being economically developed . 
  [ human , good enough ? 
  i think it 's about active sim cards , but i could be wrong . 
  lol . 
  i would n't truest a dog leash made in russia , let alone an aircraf carrier . 
  the funny thing is that ukraine supported serbia and never recognized kosovo . 
  these idiots support russia and its annexation of crimea , even though russia used the `` kosovo precedent '' as a pretext . 
  it 's sad that in serbia , which is a country that should 've learned from the past , you can still find many idiots like these guys . 
  last time i went to the us , i paid like $ 700 for a round trip from budapest to washington via london ( british airways ) . 
  i do n't dream of $ 15 transatlantic flights , but i find the current prices quite ridiculous , considering a trip from timisoara to london with wizz air costs like $ 60 . 
  we have some russian students here in timisoara . 
  like born and raised in russia . 
  maybe putin wants to come and protect them from getting small grades . 
  [ it actually works like this . 
  yeah , heard about that , no evidence though . 
  anyway , romania stronk !, 
  well , you have to agree it 's in your best interest . 
  or would you want the times of snegur/lucinschi/voronin to return ? 
  still too many women , [ since a lot of them are looking online for westerners to marry . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dyow_rd2vm ), 
  sure looks like him , but its not . 
  i doubt lukashenko ever visited transnistria . 
  [ yeah , he actually speaks romanian as well . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3aficg6nys ), 
  man , no offense , but i think you 're taking the moldovan government too seriously . 
  if romania and ukraine decided transnistria was too much of a problem for the region and needs to be dealt with , all you could do is step aside and enjoy some bags of semin\u021be while tanks and apcs roll in from both sides . 
  moldova has n't been able to solve anything in the 24 years since gaining independence . 
  yep . 
  i think we should keep them on a leash , make sure they do n't do some stupid shit like they did in the past . 
  give them some money , some scholarships , some passports ( but on strict conditions to make sure we do n't give more passports to people like irina tarasiuc ) and support their eu bid . 
  that should be enough to keep them in line , no need for the clusterfuck that unification would be . 
  i would n't trust survey data on stuff like this , last time there was a survey like this on infrastructure , romania came like second to last , below many african countries , which is obviously far from reality . 
   however romania , if it dreams at a union with moldova that 's just political bullshit . 
  if you ask any romanian about reunification with moldova , they 'll be like `` of course , they 're our brothers and shit '' , but if it became a real topic and things like the economic and political impacts would be discussed , i 'm sure the excitement would drop , significantly . 
  romanians would probably be more likely to vote for unification with germany , if it came to it , rather than moldova . 
  glad you like our women , but i 'm sure russians already have enough hot women , especially considering their sex ratio is like 0.80 males/female . 
  it 's about natural gas , not oil . 
  we never actually depended on russian gas imports , they were at most 10 % of the total consumption . 
  also , bessarabia is the republic of moldova , it does n't even have any resources , let alone gas or oil . 
  yeah , because it 's not like they could pretend to work for moldova and instead follow their own interests . 
  look at ukraine , how do you think it 's possible that the rebels always seem to have the upper hand , while the ukrainians are constantly shooting themselves in the foot ? 
  this would n't be possible without some insiders in the sbu and uaf . 
   what is particularly ironic is that you acted as an over zealous conspiracy theorist to then realize that you were wrong it 's not my fault that the views of putin bots and conspiratards tend to overlap . 
  i can sympathize more with putin bots though , they likely have a family to feed and no better job prospects , so at least they have an excuse . 
   this retardation is why i 'm firmly against you . 
  i initially thought you were a putin bot , but after looking at your post history i came to the conclusion that you are just a conspiratard . 
   if ukraine cuts that , transnistria will be 100 percent dependant on moldova , giving moldova king maker power over transnistria . 
  without open borders , transnistria dies as it has no port , no airport and checkpoints only with ukraine ( odessa ) and moldova ( chisinau ) . 
  well , i see some assumptions there , such as moldova being a fully functional state .

  - you miss good salami and sausages - bread is worse in general , but there are a few expensive brands that are fine - vegetables are good , but a bit pricier than in europe, 
  so you do n't put palm oil in butter and just about everything ? 
  what about high fructose corn syrup ? 
  really ? 
  i never knew this . 
   second , we should probably try to strengthen bordering countries this backfired very soon after in ukraine . 
  tbh i think we need a deterrent for russians as well . 
  this is the most stupid argument i hear from people like you , that communism improved the country 2x . 
  might be technically true , but most other european countries without communism improved 6x in the same period , i wonder why . 
  just look at east-west germany , i ca n't believe people today still argue about this . 
  what do you propose instead ? 
  we can not allow putin to just play with smaller countries around him : moldova 92 , georgia 08 , ukraine now, 
  ignoring the fact that romania is so poor especially because little green men forced communism on us for 45 years . 
  we still have n't recovered , and if it was n't for ue and nato many more would have left , just look at moldova where 1/3 of the population is gone . 
  and yet , bretain is a french province , only great britain makes sense , or uk . 
  otherwise , england might be more precise than britain . 
  they 're all in western europe, 
  in the meantime , germans are again thinking about themselves how special they are in europe , and how they can make sweet deals with the russians against other european interests ( and safety ) , again . 
  they saved you both feom nazis and commies , unlike some least unfortunate nations around you . 
  it 's not about wanted criminals ... 
  even now uk is not in schengen and wanted criminals can not get in . 
  it 's about people that brexiters are saying should be stopped at the borders , aka taking back control of the borders . 
  there were many complaints about border officers not being able to refuse entry to a known criminal because he was an eu citizen . 
  now they can do that easily , but no border in ireland makes it futile . 
  no they would n't , for the same reason uk can not forbid known criminals to enter the country at the moment . 
  so what ? 
  we just give up and let them fuck us ? 
  that is another matter , which to be honest i do n't know how it works : how long can a truck driver work in eu without a work visa ? 
  anyway , i was replying to your comment in which i had the feeling you are mixing free movement of people with visa free travel . 
  it would look like : `` i sell you persil at a discount , but only if you buy from me . 
  if you buy from persil germany it 's a breach of contract . 
  btw , persil germany does n't have the stock necessary for romania '' . 
  and anyway , it 's a win win situation , like a cartel , only the consumers lose . 
  do n't you agree that cartels are bad and should be regulated ? 
  to be honest , i do n't think it 's that simple . 
  there are probably agreements between the big guys from manufacturing and from selling side . 
  this is exactly the type of situation where regulatory bodies and governments have to step in and make clear and fair rules for everyone . 
  for a liberal market to function , you still need regulation . 
  free movement means you can pack your bags , go in london and start looking for work , get a rent etc. 
  travel free visa means you can pack your bags to go visit london , but not to start looking for work . 
  travel without a visa will remain . 
  at least in romania we have lots of shops now that sell imported only products , exactly for this reason . 
  imported means germany usually , but they are more expensive than they should be , as they do n't have the economy of scale on their side . 
  then label it as such : german persil , cheap persil and allow the buyers to choose . 
  you are missing the point . 
  it 's not about traffic between uk and ireland , it 's about uk and eu . 
  a big point of brexit was controlling the border , meaning that you wanted to forbid gangs of known criminals to enter uk , which you could n't do while in the eu . 
  now they could go to dublin , take a car into ni and voila , they are back again , uk does n't want that . 
  e.g. 2 uk can import tons of understandard chinese shit ( like they already do , but could do even more ) , truck it over ni-roi border and stick a new label on it . 
  eu does n't want that . 
  this is the anti-us thread here , do n't spoil this for them . 
  and yes , iused to drink heavily clorinated water from romanian taps . 
  it 's not about transit fees, 
  why is this bad ? 
  i guess it 's a nice change for the animal to be able to walk more than 20 m in one direction, 
  reported , offensive to no-identity people, 
  i know , i was just pointing out for people who do n't know . 
  checks written on red white and blue busses, 
  yes , he 's an ethnic german-romanian mix from transilvania, 
  his family is in romania for 700 years at the very minimum . 
  maybe when all balkans will be in eu and schengen , we 'll see another rejuvenation of their economy . 
  topg and sons did n't built the gas chambers , they built the crematories , because there were too many dead . 
  there was no remaining gas chambers to study , iirc . 
  the nazis blew them all up when retreating . 
  the one at ausshwitz was reconstructed by the russians , but at least how they made it , it looks like a subterran bunker with a heavy door and a hole in the ceiling . 
  pretty rudimentary compared to all other tech you ussualy find in a concentration camp . 
  in any case , if that is how gas chambers looked like , you dis n't need a company to design and build them , a corporal with some slave labour would suffice . 
  you mean the rightfuly moldovan land invaded by fascist romanians in 1918 ? 
  it was liberated thanks to the glorious red army !, 
  how much profit is taken from ee to the uk by uk firms ? 
  as bad as the mep is , that presenter is more annoying . 
  hungary has always been in good relation with ussr and russia , compaed to baltics , poland and romania . 
  after 1956 they gave them the gulyas communism , maybe that 's a big reason ? 
  you forgot moldova !, 
  also , there is no need ro wage a full war , there are steps in destabilizing and interfering massivelly in a country before bulets are fired ( see moldova again ), 
  i was specifically talking about war crimes commited by hungarians in their retreat from transilvania in 44 . 
  which you just brushed under the carpet because `` hungary was occupied by the germans '' . 
  the hungarian army helped by local fanatics tortured and killed romanians and jews in 44 . 
  terminals are good , they provide flexibility . 
  now that qatar is upping their game in gas exports , terminals might make russian gas too expensive . 
  gas supply and russian stance for example are 2 policies where there is a sharp contrast to rest of eu led by germany . 
  just as germany + france + uk ( now to be replaced by italy ) have separate meetings to make major decisions , i do n't see why eastern countries ca n't decide on issues crucial for us , but not as important for the eu or germany . 
  the link above was about hungarian army retreating , not germans . 
  germans have other crimes to answer for , which they did already , unlike hungarians who seem to still support or find excuses for war crimes . 
  it happened though , and now people wonder why ee does n't trust germany in relation to the russian bear . 
  it 's not only this , but this is recent . 
  maybe merkel will go ahead and get a well paid job at gazprom after she leaves office . 
  that 's what her predecessor schroder did . 
  you make killing innocent people sound so innocent . 
  there was n't just 2 isolated cases , i just linked the biggest ones . 
  transilvania 's villages are full of stories of the war crimes commited by hungarians in 1940 . https://ro.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/masacre_%c3%aen_transilvania_de_nord,_1940-1944 can you read romanian ? 
  in any case , hungarians started their occupatuon with killings , concentration camps for romanians and expulsions to romania . 
  i do n't know why 1000 murders seems so bening to you , i guess nationalism is not dead yet . 
  they also expelled 200k people over the course of the war . 
  luckily they did n't continue with the killings , but started again after 1944 when romania turned against germany . 
  you are missing the point . 
  if you detain everyone instead of gocing free eu passes , the numbers will fall 100x . 
  it works for australia . 
  there were huge scandals about 1 million poles in uk , we can not open the doors to everyone in mena . 
  europeans have a hard time grasping the size of africa , imagine ethyopia alone has 100 million people , nigeria 180 million etc.

  what dafuq , why was it done by cronica carcotasiolor ? 
  could n't anyone tell mihai bendeac or miki has to do one ? 
  any of those 2 , but no , it had to be cronica ... great !, 
  they actually did n't mention the epic sax guy , what a waste . 
  they are also the only country were you can still experience soviet lifestyle in europe :d they and north korea :(, 
  you 're lying , but the username checks out . 
  i tell you what we hate about our country !, 
  that 's what !, 
  yep , a good one :d, 
  anyhow , i made a post on / r/romania to stop with these posts , most people seem to agree . 
  and this one was removed too for low quality , so i guess things solved themselves . 
  sorry , maybe i took your message as a personal attack since you seemed to have a problem with my objective statement and that i guess annoyed me a bit . 
  sorry again . 
  i do n't know why you are so aggressive towards me , you even down-voted me ... 
  i never said i support this trend , i just provided some facts over why i think some people are like that right now . 
  and i did n't particularly refer to le pen but to the whole movement , happening all over europe . 
  le pen is just one of many , starting from brexit , to trump , etc. 
  i also think in this scenario nationalism is not that bad , especially when you have none . 
  romanians really needed some , it really pissed me off considering how much shit westerners or british media were throwing at us romanians were just accepting and accepting , by now the government should 've sued the british media 10 times or sth . 
  the last part of the massage just sounds unnecessarily aggressive , i get it , we are the shit of europe and we need to sit quietly in our place , not to piss the lords from luxemburg . 
  happy now ? 
  i mean wtf , i thought just the posting trend pissed you off , like me . 
  but it seems you actually have a problem with romanians thinking they are doing something better than other europeans ( true or not , whatever that might be ) and you just can not stand it . 
  you are a bit of an asshole honestly ... 
  bad news !!!!, 
  you 're technically 6th :(, 
  you need to see it in a bit of perspective . 
  romania was always this poor agricultural back water fought over by x empire and y empire . 
  most of the time we did n't even rule ourselves , and when we did , we mostly had crazy dictators , be it a fascist one ( antonescu ) or a communist one ( ceausescu ) , so romanians had a huge inferiority complex towards fellow eu . 
  should 've gone to romania 7 years ago , as a westerner you would 've picked up chicks so easily :p now it 's a bit harder . 
  back to present , now we have a disgusting wave of nationalist politics build mostly on propaganda , lies , and alternative facts . 
  and at those times , in romania happens this beautiful thing that never did before , this rebirth of national pride and civic will . 
  that 's were those messages come from , i think romanians hope that by doing this it will make all those le pen and ukip voting westerners realize they are wrong , although they only seem patronizing sadly , cause they are doing it a bit too much :( sorry . 
  as much as i like this new wave of pride in romanians , since we always had an annoying inferiority complex , especially towards westerners , i think we 're a bit too high right now xd i think the message is because of ukip , le pen , wilders , swedish democrats , sons of odin or whatever bullshit , and all those nationalists groups rising in the west right now , making it look like the west is slowly losing its values or sth . 
  but i do n't think we are the ones to give the west lessons about that . 
  we 're afraid he is just trying to quench down the protests . 
  do n't give in until something is signed !!!!!, 
  and the prime-minister signs his resignation afterwards too !, 
  killing our leaders and coup d'etats ? 
  :d remember , since 1900 we had not less than 5 coup d'etat , the one psd is doing now can be called a 6th  ), 
  true :( still amazing in a way , romania has never in its history been richer than croatia . 
  this year was actually a first . 
  also surpassing turkey and in certain ways russia too ( as in average citizens not oligarchs ) which were the nations which conquered romania all the time in the past . 
  too bad it will go to shit , i was optimistic we could surpass hungary too :p, 
  sorry then :( english is not my first language . 
  we will defend `` democracy '' ( ours ) ftfy, 
  i was wrong . 
  those countries have more in banks , but now in their own ground , which could be dug one day . 
  no we wo n't . 
  most romanians trust the eu much more than our own politicians . 
  i mean sure , the propaganda channel can try to use that , but there 's no way they will change public opinion immediately . 
  propaganda takes some time ... 
  amazing :d, 
  it 's fine  i know , and this is a huge problem with western media . 
  we were accepted in the eu and the `` western '' world only in form , when it come to caring abut each other , or solidarity , we always get shafted :( except for when a romanian gypsy pickpockets someone in britain , then you can be sure the entire media will talk about the gypsy stealing romanians ... fuck all really ... edit : sometimes they even fake news by bribing locals , like these http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/699440/romania-threaten-sky-news-reporter-gun-smuggle-report https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2234193/kinder-egg-slaves-aged-just-six-are-being-paid-22p-an-hour-for-13-hour-shifts-making-the-toys-hidden-inside-chocolate-treats/ both were faked , and the interviewed were paid for it . 
  actually they were not even ethnic romanians , but from the szeckey minority which hates romania anyway ( think of romania 's version of catalonia ), 
  and that 's why you never blindly listen to stereotypes ... romania is the country richest in gold deposits ( edit ) in eu , also one of the only net producers of oil with norway and self sustaining , the first oil refinery in the history of europe was here , vital for the nazis in ww2 . 
  also the only eu country which still has virgin forests , wolves , lynxes and 66 % of the entire brown bear population of europe . 
  there is more to `` richness '' then cash , but we 're not that poor anyway , if you do n't compare us with germany , but with our neighbors . 
  in my defense , i did n't down vote you :p it looked like an honest mistake . 
  sigh romanians not romani , those are the gypsies ... 
  there are so many other posts about what is going on . 
  just read another one or go on bloomberg or reuters . 
  you will see there what is going on ... 
  feeling so proud right now :( wish i could be there , zurich is with you boys . 
  we had a small meeting here too , at the rathaus , but i we will matter , but you guys will !, 
  impalement or guillotine ? 
  this is the question !, 
  clearly 45000 eur is not significant for the super rich romania . 
  not even worth mentioning !, 
  romania was getting cleaner , but not as fast as you thought . 
  and the mentality was still that of a post communist country , especially among the older , and mentalities do n't change for lifetimes usually . 
  the young change , but romania does n't make children and most of them ( like me ) are in the west , so they do n't count that much anymore anyway ( although they are in the streets right now , at least ) . 
  most of the media was still owned by corrupt people , most of whom got prosecuted during this anti-corruption drive . 
  the most viewed channels : antena3 is owned by voiculescu , a guy in prison . 
  romania tv is owned by sebastian ghita , a guy who ran from the country during the investigation and is not on the eu most wanted list . 
  they promised to `` clean '' those guys up and many others . 
  so they got the key players , the media , which they used to heavily manipulate the rural population ( 50 % of the country ) which only watch tv and are not highly educated , so they tend to believe what the `` smart '' guys on tv tell them . 
  as a result , with lies of higher pensions , better life , less taxes , better healthcare , they got the vote . 
  this worked cause due to the post communist corruption , people started thinking that who lies more will do at least half of what they lie ( bullshit i know , but this was the mentality ) and psd lied the most . 
  for the first time usr and even pnl ( to a certain extent ) tried to lead a clean honest campaign , but that bit them in the ass due to the above mistrust and post communist mentality . 
  but they said nothing about amnesty , absolutely fucking nothing !!!, 
  it 's amazing , but even their brainwashed supporters are angered right now . 
  this is clearly done only for them , in the most miserable disgusting way . 
  and this is the first fucking thing they do , as if this is why those poor gullible people voted them for . 
  and here we are , people who stole under 50000 euros are not arrested anymore , cause 50000eur is clearly a small sum for romanians . 
  but that poor bastard who tried to steal a chicken to feed his family and got caught , no , he stays in prison . 
  you draw your own answer ... 
  from tonight !, 
  how i wish i was in bucharest right now !!, 
  they give us no choice , it 's high noon for the real revolution to happen , since as we all know , the first one was just a fake cover up !, 
  corruption no more , equality for everyone !!, 
  fuck the church too , i have good friends who are gay , and they are 1000 times more reasonable than the average psd voter !!!, 
  the romanian one is an eagle , a lion , an ox , 2 dolphins ... oh a 2nd eagle , wait this one is on a bridge , all inside another eagle . 
  too bad we did n't place some wolves , bears , lynxes , maybe a bat or a dragon in there . 
  could 've been the true mythical zoo nation :d, 
  productive ... 
  just be thankful we do n't have the gypsy stereotype in common :p, 
  do n't give in guys !, 
  these protests make me wish i was in romania right now , i wan na be there :(,

  you can have turkish and turkic cultural influences even without a turkish-muslim population . 
   politically it was never involved in the so-called `` balkan wars '' nor did it have any conflicts with any of the neighbors . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_balkan_war ( see beligerents )  so , as it stands now , romania is no more a balkan country , just because it borders the balkans , than say , hungary . 
  this is extremely laughable . 
  hungary is in almost every way central european , culturally speaking . 
  romania is a mix of eastern , central and balkan , but because the capital is in the south , the area with the most balkan influences , i 'd say the balkan influence is the strongest . 
  you 're really stretching the definition of colony . 
  i think dobrogea is the only thing remotely resembling a romanian colony , but it never went independent . 
  maybe rep. of moldova too . 
  sort of . 
   romanians from the carpathians assimilated the local slavs living in the plains afaik , slavic toponyms are distributed rather equally regardless of altitude/geography . 
  that makes the picture you paint rather inaccurate . 
  that 's like calling anyone from the british isles english , because most are english , even if some are from the rep. o ' ireland, 
   ravni kotari ( croatia , near zadar ) has always been croatia and never been serbian and was also the cradle of the medieval croatian kingdom ( knin was also a capital at one point , but that 's a really 50-50 / iffy area ) . 
  i just think that some ethnic populations would have to remain outside of their own states for practical and historical reasons . 
  i see . 
  but these historical reasons exist in other areas too . 
  western romania ( transylvania ) and areas that are now slovakia were until the 20th century extremely important areas for hungary . 
  bratislava was even a capital once if i 'm not mistaken . 
  then there is kosovo . 
  and so on . 
  sometimes i think ethnic realities must trump history for pragmatic reasons . 
   i think you 'd endear yourself to quite a few dalmatians . 
  how so ? 
   it completely disregards historical administrative divisions in mixed ethnicity areas care to elaborate ? 
  i 'm not really sure what you mean . 
   but deporting those who were illegally brought in by a foreign invasion and their children . 
   turkey 's act of colonizing was more like ethnic cleansing . 
  i really do n't care which is * more like ethnic cleansing * . 
  i 'd rather there be nothing of the likes . 
   and there should be a population transfer : all the mainland turkish families who were brought to cyprus to colonize it should be expelled from cyprus ( though this may shock some of you , this kind of population exchange has already been done between greece and turkey , and of course with other ethnicites like germans after ww2 , israeli colonists leaving gaza etc. . ) . 
  ethnic turkish cypriots who were on the island before turkish invasion should be allowed to stay . 
  how about we apply the baltic solution . 
  let them ( turkish colonists ) stay and make them reapply for citizenship . 
  i 'm really not so fond of ethnic cleansing . 
   a degree of autonomy for the constituent ethnic groups was crucial and the best way to ensure that was a federation . 
  how about this : http://i.imgur.com/lk2u9jf.jpg it is molded on ethnic teritories . 
  italic regions are autonomous areas ( dalmatia for example is an autonomous exclave of croatia , bihac and sandzak for bosnia , krajna for serbia , besides kosovo and vojvodina . ), 
  im not claiming its the best solution ( maybe there are geographic objections ) , but its still better than having a mini-yugoslavia ( bih ) in the middle as a constituent state . 
  i 'm all for it . 
  hell , give them independence if that 's what they want . 
  he either should have abolished the states altogether and made one single yugoslav state , or he should have made ethnic states . 
  his setup was a disaster waiting to happen . 
   i would be for dividing it back up between ethnic lines , it would solve a lot of problems . 
  true . 
  tito should have carved up yugoslavia into ethnic constituent republics . 
  that way when it broke up , it would n't have done so with all the bloodshed . 
  they are not involved in kosovo , but under the same principle of self-determination , they should be allowed to have an independence referendum . 
  afaik , they are not to fond of the bosnian state . 
   how come republika srpska ( 2m ppl , 98 % serbs ) never got the chance of referendum from eu ?!, 
  they should . 
   kosovo should be recognized as a legitimate state seperate from serbia . 
  agreed , but north kosovo should get a referendum , whether they want to remain part of kosovo or serbia . 
  keeping them in kosovo by force is a recipe for disaster . 
  we also have transnistria . 
  also abkhazia and south ossetia and nagorno-karabakh if you consider the south caucasus to be in europe . 
  :( apparently information is scarce . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.vipmagazin.md/top/numele_la_moldoveni._ion_forever/ ) says the most common surname is ` rusu ' , and the [ statistcs office says ] ( http://www.stare-civila.gov.md/pages/statistica-2008#14 ) that the most common surname for kids born in 2008 is the same , so it sort of confirms the first link . 
  ok , piggybacking on your comment some more info on romanian surnames : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_name also , interesting as regional trait :  the ending - ei , usually preceded by a - in front of a female name , is a latin inherited female genitive , like in amariei `` of maria '' , aelenei `` of elena '' . 
  these matrilineal-rooted surnames are common in the historical region of moldavia . 
  and of ourse , transylvania has a lot of surnames of hungarian origin . 
  here 's a list : http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/appendix:romanian_names_of_hungarian_origin, 
  russian word for godless , romanianized . 
  an alternative soviet word for ` atheist ' that never really gained any ground in the romanian language . 
  the first atheist literature i came in contact with ( in the late 90 's , before the new atheist wave ) was [ yemelian iaroslavski ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yemelyan_yaroslavsky ) 's books ( translated into romanian in the '60s ) . 
  he also had a magazine in the ussr , called [ bezbozhnik ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bezbozhnik_ ( magazine \\ ) ) . 
  when i decided to create an atheist blog , i though the name fitting . 
  [ he was obviously romanian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/talk%3anikola_tesla/nationality_and_ethnicity ) / jk, 
   were the assumptions to hold something tells me they wo n't  foreign workers will `` change national identity '' would n't be the first time in the british isles ( ignoring the anachronicity of talking about ` national identity ' pre 19th c. ) . 
  1066/nevar forgeth !, 
  also by 2066 some of the white others will be assimilated in to `` white british '' . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_sxzooexyq ) is golden as well !, 
  half my coworkers have monday off for catholic easter . 
  the other half have it off whenever orthodox easter is . 
  as long as it 's the same number of days for each community , there should be no problems . 
  the romanian orthodox church has new style christmas and old style easter . 
  so christmas falls on the same day as the western one . 
  but i do know of mixed serbian-romanian families who have 2 christmases , 
   it 's monacans or monegasque, 
  awesome . 
  reading articles like like this makes me wish i had pursued a career related to history !, 
  hungarians in romania get days of for easter on different dates than romanians , because western christian easter falls on a different date from orthodox easter . 
  we even have a euroredditor from there, 
  they need to have something reflective on the back so they are visible at night and speeding cars do n't suddenly hit a cart in the dark from behind . 
  used plates are nailed to the end of the cart because they are reflective . 
  we 're working on it . 
  these bans are just silly . 
  a lot of foodstuffs are regional . 
   we greeks have a lot of turkish words as well , especially food related romanians as well . 
  a good chunk of food names come from the balkans . 
  yeah , but you can understand the meaning from context . 
  even writing with an english keyboard . 
  then they will be changed , then vandalized again ... after a while , people will get used to the bilingual signs and the ` vandals ' will give up . 
  same thing happened in romania a decade ago with romanian + hungarian signs . 
   you should all adopt the greek alphabet ; after all , cyrillic and latin are its child systems . 
  let 's go directly to phoenician . 
  [ werther effect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/werther_effect ), 
  yep , shit 's crazy ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_turanism#turanism_and_hungarian_fascism  the leader of the hungarian fascist arrow cross party , ferenc sz\u00e1lasi , believed in the existence of a `` turanian-hungarian '' race ( which included jesus christ ) . 
  the idea was a key part of his ideology of `` hungarism '' . 
  in hungary some fascists ( and non-fascists ) tried to link the ancestors of the hungarians to timur , the ottomans and japan , which some hungarians of the 1930s described as the ` other sword of turan ' ( the first sword being hungary ) .

  we also wanted a strong identity to bind the union of our 2 historical kingdoms ( wallachia & moldova ) and get recognition from the western powers , especially the french . 
  things went full retard during ceausescu 's regime , when history was presented in such a way that we were the direct successors of the romans and dacians , downplaying all of our other infuences ( mainly slavic and ottoman ) . 
  this served the purpose in creating a national myth of romanian exceptionalism and noble origins . 
  a lot of people grew up with that version of history and can get very defensive or be in denial when presented with the obvious contradictions , especially when it comes to language . 
  romanian language has a similar history as english up to a point . 
  english started as a west germanic language , then came the norman french influence . 
  romanian started as a local variant of vulgar latin , then came the slavonic influence . 
  however later on , as our country stepped into modernity we relatinized our language through heavy borrowing from french and italian ( ranging from science/technological inovation , administration to fashion and city life ) and a part of slavic words fell into disuse or become archaic ( outdated customs , technology and social systems ) . 
  most people do n't know this and coupled with the carefully cosmetized history taught in schools , they assume we are more latin than we really are and more connected to the west than with our neighbors . 
  even more after we went full retard with the `` we are latin master race ! '', 
  mantra during our national awakening & after the brainwashing of ceausescu 's nationalistic flavored communism . 
  this resulted in a very awkward inferiority complex towards the west and a superiority complex with our neighbors ( especially slavs , with which we have more in common than we 'd like to admit ) . 
  did n't know romanians and bulgarians are such a threat to british culture ( being european themselves anyway ) . . meanwhile sharia zones, 
  welp , luckily britain was n't populated by anglo-saxons back then . 
  are you holding a grudge in place for the celts and picts ?

  they 'll show up any minute now . . ... oops !,

  honest mistake !, 
  is n't iskander a turkish name ? 
  just curious, 
  italian intonation sounds like people argue or are being reproachful all the time . 
  hungarian sounds like kids mocking each other with made up words that rhyme . 
  bulgarian sounds morose and naive . 
  swedish sounds very loveless & unsettling . 
  finnish sounds like something dr.strange from marvel comics would chant before doing some funky spells . 
  ps : please do n't be offended , this is just a shallow perception bonus : romanian sounds like a hobo schizophrenic version of vulgar latin . 
  `` when a language dies , a way of understanding the world dies with it . '', 
  would you trust a bank like dacia felix to handle your money ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  anyway neac\u0219u 's letter , apart from the slavonic phrases ( first , last sentence and the repeatinig `` i pak '' ) is very intelligible to a modern romanian speaker . 
  fta  as opposed to the first documents of other languages , which are in general more ancient , the romanian language used in this letter is very similar to the language spoken nowadays . 
  whoa !, 
  judging from lord 's prayer ( lu patri nostru ) , i see it 's a bit more similar to romanian than italian is . 
  mainly because it kept the u 's instead of replacing them with o 's all the time . 
  because it 's not serving a single person/political force . 
  how different is ukrainian compared to russian ? 
  can you give me a simple example is the difference bigger than between czech and slovak ? 
  not only did you lose transylvania ( and other regions ) in the face of [ demographic realities of the time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:austria_hungary_ethnic.svg ) , but you also lost it in a war : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian-romanian_war_of_1919 so the correct word would be `` lost '' , not `` stolen '' . 
  can we move on now ? 
  it 's ok , you can visit or even move here . 
  there 's this thing called eu that we should be concerned on consolidating , because without it we 're pretty fucking irelevant anyway when faced with usa , china , russia etc.

  the anti-corruption agency was/is a pollitical tool for the current president . 
  so when you 're convicting people on a very thin basis ( politically motivated ) , no wonder you get reactions like that from the public because it lacks credibility . 
  now bracing for downvotes from the people who think i support either side of the political circus . 
  you get what you deserve , 
  in romanian , the colloquial version is `` io '' . 
  apart from some throaty consonants ( h ? ), 
  that no one forces you to match like a native speaker , dutch intonation sounds quite cool . 
  lovely song btw . 
  set phasers to hate !, 
  not that this is n't a dick move , but i guess even our ass-kissing europhile pollitical class got tired of being the doormat of the eu . 
  this is pretty uncharacteristic of them . 
  maybe they want to test the waters first ? 
  right ?

  roma gypsies are originally from india and they 're usually brown ( very brown when not mixed ) . 
  there are rare exceptions though of lightskinned roma with blue/or blonde hair ( personally i have n't seen any with both ) , but i would n't blame anyone for being suspicious, 
  welp  in varietate concordia i would n't push rome as a civilizational identity to the nordics for example . . ( although it 's a bit ironic that motto is in latin :d ), 
  this is about current politicians . 
  welp , we have the snow , but not the nordic expertise to clear it such is life, 
  you can since 2009 or so . 
  not that was really enforced before that, 
  human capital is very important for a nation claiming to be a world power , especially one with such a vast area and rich in natural resources . 
  your comment is totally off the mark . 
  finn complaining about snow ? 
  not a good look . .

  what must be ten years down the road , and i still dislike hamilton . 
  but i realize no one has done more damage to that union that the jeffersonian yeomanry model that had no foundation in real life . 
   well that and a 2:1 manpower disadvantage , a severe materiel disadvantage , naval blockades , and political isolation internationally . 
  i admit , that 's true . 
  but having an entire state army not leave its state because of its governor for a year , i forgot which , certainly did n't help . 
  neither did leaving the railroad to rot to pieces instead of taking the reigns like the north did . 
  you 're mistaking federalism for centralization . 
  this is not a perfect match . 
  germany is a federal government , switzerland is a federal government . 
  france is a centralized government , and so is the uk . 
  federalism means building the kind of checks and balances that makes decentralization work . 
  i think you have a rosy view of early decentralized america , like i used to . 
  the truth is it was an utter mess . 
  they completely fucked up their economic stability because there was innate distrust of a central bank , a distrust funded by private bankers . 
  the southern state got way more representation than was right because of constant compromise politics from the other states , and that allowed slavery to flourish . 
  the reason the confederacy got beaten during the war is because the confederate states kept the old way of `` state militias '' doing their own thing , while the north had a united command . 
  to work properly decentralized systems need help , to prevent information asymmetry , perverse incentives , and duplicated effort . 
  it 's not something that magically does well on it 's own . 
  edit : btw , if you meant that the eu is more centralized than switzerland , it really is n't . 
  people do n't realize just how closely they are mirroring the us with their euroscepticism . 
  the reason the us is such a clusterfuck in some ways is because the anti-federalists , who dominated early us history , kept postponing genuine reform until the last possible minute , when emergency measures needed to be taken often through strong decisive moves from the president . 
  if europe is to avoid the same fate we need to do what we did for the party system , and improve of things instead of operating in denial . 
  did you think i was talking about a road or something ? 
  dude , that 's harsh . 
  i for one hope he has a long and healthy life serving his sentence .

  just earlier this week , his fellow horse thief orban declared that the trump election has signalled that they too can start being more beligerent . 
  quote `` we have received permission from the highest secular office in the world , in line with which we will also be allowed to place ourselves first , '', 
  she 's got a lot to loose , and that is trump 's tune at the moment . 
  if we like it or not , everyone around us has gone into what can only be described as `` world domination mode '' ,, 
  and there should n't . 
  we are n't that overly centralized . 
  but there should be talk about increasing dublin-paris-frankfurt connections , to help create a cohesive financial market . 
  sorry , but this is one of those moments where every european has the duty to show discretion , good judgement , and leave some to their own devices . 
   oh please do . 
  the spanish government would love to sit the uk down to hash out a `` trade deal '' . 
  it has a lot of things it wants decided early . 
   the guarantee of peace created by these principles will facilitate the great task of both governments of finding a solution for problems of political , economic and social kinds , based on a just and fair adjustment of the interests of both parties . 
  the good old continental treaty system , based on the tried and tested principle of national self-interest . 
  back when countries were countries , and not forced to compromise under a restrictive supranational organization . 
  `` tu quoque '' is not an argument my friend . 
  it 's a testament to the shittyness of the world . 
  i love europe . 
   i do n't do it . 
  does that mean i am not a man no . 
  it means you 're not an adolescent . 
  apparently that 's a rarety nowadays . 
  a system of verified identity checking ? 
  are you mad sir ?

  using a combination of utility and bank letters to prove who you are while your government has complete access to everything you do is the only way to provide for the pragmatic , privacy and freedom loving great british public !, 
  are you serious ? 
  merkel is the worst person to have when a crisis is looming . 
  she plays reactionary firefighter , instead of actually preventing the damage from happening . 
  her cabinet pretty much decided eurozone policy and we 're still recovering from repeated shocks . 
  her russia-friendly stance bit her in the ass repeatedly , and she still tries to support north stream 2 . 
  she was opposed to any help to italy/greece in 2012 when the refugee crisis was growing . 
  she ca n't even control europe . 
  she was against the spitzenkandidat system in 2014 . 
  but because she ca n't be bothered to do anything until shit happens , she was stuck with a fait accompli of juncker , instead of being allowed to push her prefered candidate : the infamous christine lagarde that took direction from the eurogroup . 
  cue private meetings with euroseptic leaders , half-assed attempts at resistance , and inevitably her siding with winning side before the fight even started . 
  she is someone who never fixes anything . 
  she just waits for the car to break down and then makes a big deal of looking busy . 
   it was mostly a pro-the eu not getting completely overwhelmed stance . 
  it seemed more of a pro- `` we ca n't send them back to hungary/greece but we ca n't look weak '' stance . 
  in 2012 , merkel was saying everything the v4 saying right now . 
  would that be geordie english , scouse english , yorkie english , or the rp english only public school graduates speak ? 
   i think more in categories `` are your utilitarian enough to sacrifice other people for the greater good '' . 
  and if the answer is yes then why not do it for a benevolent dictatorship since you already compromised on freedom of other people from the start . 
  you do n't sacrifice people for the greater good . 
  you find people who are already willing to do it , and then back them so they succeed . 
  that 's the thing , we do n't need pawns . 
  we need something we ca n't buy with money , or force with guns : genuine belief and alliance . 
  people who when left alone , continue working without compulsion . 
  we need to nurture geopolitical mutualism , starting through individuals and working our way up . 
   truth be told the injustices present today in europe in most places are a far cry from the ancient regime , even the worst places are better . 
  they might turn for the worse and then we will probably see a return of freedom fighters but we are not there yet . 
  not everywhere . 
  that 's my point . 
  outside our continent there is a liberal class that faces the exact same struggles against sectarianism , classism and despotism . 
  and saudi arabia , iran , russia , are all funding their adversaries . 
  as a civilization , we have left such people to their fate . 
  in ukraine , in turkey , in egypt . 
  simply because we are either unable or unwilling to play the game . 
  the pound will never become irrelevant . 
  its value as a century 's worth of cautionary tales makes it a priceless heirloom in economic history . 
  it 's been , like , a whole 2 months since a `` euro is doomed '' story . 
  we 're just playing catch up . 
   not mentioning that potential agents having liberal democratic ideals and the talent ( and will ) for turning people in other countries into assets is not a common combination . 
  liberal and idealistic does n't automatically mean gormless and squeamish . 
  used to be quite the opposite , revolutionaries agitating , proselytising , and planning . 
  covert societies , secret union meetings , and political fire-brands making their way through perfumed european parlours . 
  this continent was built by people who broke down class and social barriers with the selfless intent of martyrs , women throwing themselves in front of horses , students in front of guns , intellectuals into the jails . 
  the weekend protestors and middle class slacktivists that define modern liberalism are a shadow on the wall , compared to the candles that held the fire . 
  the uk , in my experience , does n't blame the us as a matter of policy . 
  breton woods , iraq war or financial crisis , it 's always reinterpreted as a domestic failure . 
  i think they 'll be quite happy together , actually . 
  `` trade deal with us done in record time , special relationship alive and well '' we should be wise to anglomedia by now , that 's exactly how they 'll put it . 
  no one is going to look too closely , and anybody that does will be non sequitur-ed to death .

   avramopoulos told meps in the civil liberties committee that `` dublin should not be any more just a mechanism to allocate responsibility . '', 
   he said it needs to be `` a solidarity instrument among member states '' . 
   that includes `` the need to have a distribution key system under which applicants would be quasi-automatically allocated to a member state '' . 
   first signed as a convention in 1990 , dublin was n't implemented until 1997 . 
  it was then adopted as a regulation in 2003 and then commonly referred to as dublin ii . 
   but it never worked in practice . 
   the latest iteration , known as dublin iii , was then proposed in december 2008 . 
  the eu co-legislatures took fives year before it became law . 
   but dublin iii has n't really worked either . 
   if applied correctly , greece and italy would have had to handle the bulk of the some 1 million arrivals last year . 
   those slipping through the registration process and caught in another member state would then have to be returned - although returns to greece have been banned since 2010 due to poor holding conditions . 
   over 800,000 people arrived in greece alone in 2015 . 
   another 18,384 have landed in greece from the start of the new year . 
  the majority , almost half , are syrian refugees , followed by afghans and iraqis . 
   earlier this week , dutch migration minister klaas dijkhoff said the 25-year old system had been doomed to fail from the start . 
   imposing distribution keys on how to divvy up asylum seekers has been met in the recent past with strong resistance from some member states . 
   it is not yet clear whether the dublin revamp will make migrant distribution binding or voluntary . 
   binding quotas created an uproar when the eu commission unveiled its relocation plan last may , one month after some 600 people drowned in the mediterranean sea , just south of italy 's lampedusa island . 
   the may proposal required each member state to take in a pre-defined number of asylum seekers from italy and greece . 
   it did n't get far . 
  by june , eu leaders made it voluntary and then signed it off in september . 
   the relocation plan has failed to deliver . 
   fewer than 300 people , out of the planned 160,000 , have been relocated so far . 
  from your `` more detailed article '' :  the opposition tried to push through amendments , thanks to which they were legally exempt physicians who must respect medical confidentiality , and journalists melting their resources . 
  with these requirements but failed . 
  it seems to me that `` doctor-patient privileges , protection of sources for journalist among others '' were in failed amendments rather than removed from existing law . 
  does n't that make the title somewhat misleading ? 
  but this is wrong . 
  some countries in eastern europe have small muslim communities that are small but old and with which relations have been overwhelmingly peaceful . 
  the muslim community in romania for example is older than an unified romanian state and is concentrated in south-eastern parts of the country that used to be under direct ottoman administration . 
  it is extremely sad if the general worsening of relations between the west in general and muslim is making these people feel isolated . 
  but not a sufficient reason to accept mass migration . 
   majority of germans against merkel 's refugee policy not really , or at least not by a large enough margin . 
  things will get worse . 
  no it 's not . 
  we used to have a large [ anti-hungarian party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_romania_party ) but it 's gone now . 
  historically many romanian governments have been supported by a coalition which included the [ hungarian minority party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_union_of_hungarians_in_romania ) so it 's in their interest to play nice . 
  france is such a fucking mess . 
  they 've let this fester for so long and now their getting criticized for attempting to enforce laws . 
  it would have been easier to deal with this earlier . 
   it means those affected by tonight 's clear-out are unlikely to be able to get a space in the new shelters for weeks -- and even if they do , * many fear registering for a bed is a trick to prevent them claiming asylum in britain * . 
   seriously , what 's your fixation with germany . 
  have you seen usofa telling japan to stfu because pearl harbor ? 
  the difference is that germany is much larger and stronger that poland and believes it has the right to tell poland what to do . 
  it 's also worth noting that psd is mostly conservative on social issues , going so low as to bash the hungarian minority for votes . 
  there is no romanian party that subscribes to western-style left-liberalism .

  ironically pretty much the entire [ history of that village ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rosia_montana#history ) is that of mining activity . 
   the government has [ ... ] signed into law a measure which puts broadcasting under direct state control . 
  no they did n't . 
  they made a law which puts * state * broadcasting under more direct state control . 
  as far as i know private media is not affected . 
  this omission dramatically changes the meaning of the sentence to something that is just not true . 
  the journalist who wrote this is either incompetent or is otherwise so biased against the new government of poland that he 's willing to not only spin and mislead but outright lie . 
  but i do n't think anyone should care about the eu 's `` global influence '' . 
  there 's no reason why small european countries ca n't have perfectly friendly relations with the likes of india and china . 
  it seems to me that eu elites are demanding more power for themselves for no other reason than that they want more power . 
  this does not seem to benefit regular citizens in any way , especially not on the eu 's periphery . 
   the global order is shifting east , with new powers emerging or emerged . 
  china and india both have populations more than double that of the eu . 
  the population of the united states is already over 300 million and growing . 
  if individual european nations like britain want to play a role in global decision-making -- and if europe wants to keep its influence -- they can do it only through the heft of europe . 
  what kind of fear mongering bullshit is this ? 
  even if this was true and the `` losses '' to eu are 2x larger it 's worth noting that eu nominal gdp is 10x larger . 
   give us raw information only , please . 
  this is an opinion article . 
   the biggest overwhelming need is that europeans will have to react to the harsh winds of political globalization in the future . 
  political globalization is more than just the economic globalization that has been talked about endlessly in the last decade . 
  it is a quest for political order on a planet that has outgrown its merely regional structure . 
  winds from where ? 
  whose quest is this ? 
   all of this creates a need for a vessel that allows europeans to compete in political globalization and contribute to global order . 
  whose need is this ? 
  the only drive for further political integration is coming from the dreams european political elites . 
  presumably they are concerned about the rising influence of india and china and the comparative decline of countries like france ? 
  fuck them . 
  i see no reason to share that concern . 
  in eastern europe the primary foreign policy goal is maintaining independence . 
  the most plausible threat is russian expansionism but can be adequately balanced by an alliance with the us . 
  other than that we really do n't have major security concerns . 
  small countries are perfectly capable of functioning independently . 
  over history the number of independent polities has continuously increased since around ww1 . 
  this happened primarily because of a decline in the willingness to use force to impose order upon others . 
  why would this trend reverse ? 
   my first prediction is that in the medium to long term , there will be more integration of european foreign policy , and even of security and defense . 
  not before enormous pain , and much national resistance . 
  but if europeans are not suicidal then this will come . 
  so poles and hungarians are supposed to surrender their independence because of some nebulous threat forseen by the west ? 
  how is this better than suicide ? 
   incredibly lucky for the low , low levels of terrorism towards the west resulting from its actions . 
  this is equivalent to saying that europe deserves more terrorism . 
   efforts to manage the refugee emergency are failing as more countries tighten border security , a trend he says could unravel unity in the bloc . 
  opinions on how to deal with this are far too diverse for an united response . 
  countries should make their own decisions about how to deal with this and cooperate outside eu institutions . 
  all an eu push for common policy can do is further hurt relations between members . 
  the eu should stop getting involved . 
  tl ; dr : if we let them all in they will eventually assimilate and turn into western liberals . 
  facts do not seem to support this , look at france . 
  the amount of illiberal arrogance in this is also quite shocking .

  this post is so cute !, 
  so what is so uncivilized in this video ? 
  these cows produce topnotch milk for the society and brings makes the capital flow . 
  that prussian 145 % discipline makes me want to cry :'), 
  i did have , right now i 'm an engineering student thus i do n't know if i have time for all the lovey-dovey relationship . 
  by `` european like minded '' i was referring to the liberty to critique anything , from simple things like bad parenting till the governmental problems . 
  so basically i 'd consider that some russians are really narrow minded when it comes to certain political , economic , and social problems ( probably like how amish are in us and most of americans do n't get why would you want to live like this , you know ? ) . 
  as an example i can give : for social one , most bad things that happen in chechnya , simple russian folk would comment that it 's the chechen 's wrong doing and not theirs and would like to walk over other [ nationalities ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zqnkdcitdm ) because they 're the majority ( in that video basically some individuals from the police department that were n't even in their uniforms , asked 2 chechen girls to show their passport , one of the girls was a mother that was feeding at that time , and they did n't even show any documents to prove that they 're actually coppers . 
  and chechens are the luckiest ones in the whole r.f. 
  the politics kind of bind together with the economics , they 're angry on the us sanction because they think that us is the evil warmonger that wishes only destruction and chaos , and while they 're believing that russian culture is based solely on resistance and defensive wars ( most of them think that they had all the rights to annex crimea ) . 
  about oligarchs i 'm not even talking , putin is kind of the boss of this mafia-state , or so it seems that he 's the honcho . 
  state media is controlled by kremlin and most russians believe it without checking also the western channels , thus their opinion is based from one point of view . 
  i 'm sorry that i had to write this shakespearean play but otherwise i do n't know if you would 've understood my point of view . 
  :d i love their apsuridstan album !, 
  like , i 'm a really hardcore anime and manga fan , but i do n't want my kid to have a `` relationship '' with an anime girl/boy . 
  nope , [ malta ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2016/10/20/which-is-the-most-obese-country-in-the-eu ) has quite a high obesity rate . 
  [ true !, 
  ] ( https://stateofobesity.org/adult-obesity/ ) sorry ;p, 
  well , ca is the place where people are usually doing fitness and has the lowest obesity rate in the us . 
  yeah , i do n't get these guys too if they 're joking or being serious . 
  come on man , do n't be cranky , i could differentiate the bridges because the landscapes are different , some are just joking . 
  damn , it 's so cool to feel the breeze , the smell of the green grass , hearing seagulls from afar and the boats balancing on the water doing cranky noises while waking up . 
  no , i do like to engage into complicated debates because this makes an interesting conversation . 
  i do agree with the fact that it 's not based but ( greatly ) influenced . 
  to answer your question regarding islam and its influence on europe , i had colleagues at high school that were `` of islamic origin '' some were turkish , others were arabs from syria , iraq , and egypt there was a guy from iran , all those guys and girls were really great , did n't yell on the hall ways about islam , to be honest , they did n't even care much about religion , the girls were walking in shorts , boys were listening to rock music and did n't mind take some shots and drinks . 
  the parents maybe are more conservative on religion but the kids ? 
  hah , to think about it , they 're more european than europeans themselves !, 
  / s but still they did n't show any desire to do a jihad in the class . 
  those cunts from berlin and koln are a different thing , it 's like saying the difference between german army and soviet army , eliminating the fact that nazi troops killed jews on daily basis , they were an organized army , with hospitable manners and respectful attitude towards the simpletons ( why i 'm saying this : long short story , germans came to a village , asked for food and milk in exchange of chocolate or various stuff in a peaceful and friendly manner ; when soviets came , took a ppsh-41 and shot the wine barrels when they started to drink , they drunk so much that some of them died < - these stories are true , my great-grandfather had to explain to a nkvd/kgb officer why an officer drowned in his cellar with wine -_- , poles , you 're not the only one nation that detests kremlin government ) . 
  and that 's what i 'm saying , asking any idiot with 3 elementary classes ready to fight any world war will bring you more problems than benefits , asking a civilized person with at least an undergrad will help your nation . 
  thus this is my answer , those which make troubles give them to the italians , they know how to drive them back , those who are smart and civilized , let them stay , it 'll help the economy and the demographics . 
  best . 
  i know man , i know . 
  dude , geographically we are kinda in the eastern europe , we are not slavs , we are a romance language speaking country and people know this , they knew since the middle ages . 
  today most of the difference is thanks to our `` beloved government '' , but these things can be fixed by us and we can live normally as anyone living in any other parts of europe , same goes for bulgarians , we just have to pull ourselves by our own bootstraps and to advance . 
  those which say eastern europe is grey and dirty clearly have n't seen a newspaper or anything related to media for around 25 years . 
  also people do n't care anymore about this bias , they just want to know if you 're skilled and willing to work , that 's it . 
  i never understood soviet union , it was meant to do equality but it brought more nationalism for russians and the rest were just some disposable garbage . 
  firstly , you 're getting pissed for no reason , and i do n't see any point talking to you anymore , because this was about the land and not the people living on this land called `` europe '' . 
  secondly , turkish laws were based on the justinian the great 's laws ( he was the last native latin speaking emperor i believe ) . 
  the music is based on the greek one . 
  and turks did take some loan words from the greek and from albanians , slavs etc. 
  if you think that being muslim is not european then what are bosniaks and albanians ? 
  or the tatars living in europe for hundreds of years not just in turkey but also in bulgaria , romania , russia , and if i 'm not mistaking also in poland ? 
  thus your pure bred europe is quite based on thinking `` that we want to live how we were used to with cheeki breeki , majonez , with skin-heads , and we do n't want to hear anyone 's else opinion . '', 
  this way of seeing things is so russian federation style that you ca n't even imagine , ironically you quite hate each other . 
  that 's why i do n't agree with you , mate . 
  ( pour downvotes on me like one of your russian girls ), 
  european : of , relating to , or characteristic of europe or its people ; a native or inhabitant of europe ; a person of european descent .

  if a man has a passion , he 'll give his life for it .

  that 's why jacques hamel will remain in history as a true saint and this imam will just be a dark spot .

  if imam wants someone to burn , why is n't he burning himself like the buddhist from vietnam did once ? 
  no , it 's still just a tip , your saying , in therms of population but also from a geographical point of view . 
  and this thread/topic/map is n't about demographics it 's about the land . 
  also , out of those 10 million turks , most are of european descent , mostly from balkans . 
  i do n't think that the tip called constantinople is half of turkey, 
  in spanish `` va '' means `` go '' probably `` satana va ! '', 
  means `` go away satan '' , romance language speakers say in this way as how father jacques hamal said in latin . 
  but the church latin is a bit different than the classical one .

  about politics i would say it is more related to the tolerance of the nationals rather than their happiness . 
  we ca n't say that every german likes merkel but at least they can tolerate her .

  at least you do n't have a [ shit-hole ] ( https://www.ziarulnational.md/getimages/620x2000x2/large/6ad1f9c28bd6fc3350b7bc5c926239a0.jpg ) in the middle of your capital .

  yes, 
  voted santa klaus, 
  for the first part of your reply i must agree with you , but for the second i will disagree , as you said the war would 've been longer and more bloodier ( i did n't know that they relocated the factories ) to which i agree . 
  to answer my denial on the fact that they would have not spilled every drop of blood is because in previous wars they did n't do such reluctant thing .

  do you actually believe it 's that easy and clear and also , do you believe that if you say this sub is left and left is wrong , you 're actually right and have won an argument ? 
  the sax is back !, 
  not sure why you 're including the kingdom with the other two eras ; they could n't be more different !, 
  excluding of course the years of the two world wars , all in all it was a very prosperous and civilized period in romania 's history . 
  regarding the 10 years since we 've joined the eu , these have already been a period of remarkable growth and improvements in all sectors . 
  even so , we could 've done much better , however we keep getting [ hit by the plague ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_democratic_party_\\ ( romania \\ ) ) . 
  through our own doing , unfortunately . 
  i do n't want to presume too much , since i do n't actually know the situation , however two questions come to mind immediately : * is there anything preventing the isps from withdrawing from this agreement at any time they wish ? 
  for example , right after you 're out of the eu ? 
  * presuming they all stay within this agreement , who 's actually supervising them and are there any sanctions possible in case they do n't follow it ? 
  for some weird reason i 've yet to understand , i 've been following and actually posting on / r/the _ donald for a few months now ( not on this account ) , mostly correcting obviously false info here and there . 
  i 've actually been banned 3 times already just for this , but that 's a whole different story . 
  so i do n't have any concrete proof of this , it 's just the impression i got in th is time . 
  most of the accounts i 've interacted with there are active on other subreddits as well and from the way they post they seem to be quite invested in trump and his `` allies '' , more so than you would be if it was just a shitty job for you . 
  that being said , i definitely do n't exclude the possibility that there are pro-russian `` instigators '' within the subreddit , especially among the mods . 
  while i definitely agree that they 're basically doing russia 's game , unfortunately most of them have nothing to do with russia . 
  they 're trump 's young base and yes , it 's scary how deluded they are , at least those posting on that subreddit . 
   biggest subreddit on reddit * [ citation needed ] *, 
  58 % in paris , way under even this low average , so this is likely representative for his base . 
  i 'm actually getting a bit nervous now . 
  a 51 % - 55 % win would be pretty bad as well . 
  this is actually scary . 
  i know it 's probably coming from a 15y old , but even so , it 's scary to think that there are people among the new generations that `` need a new fuhrer to rise '' . 
  it raises mine , since this could have a strong calming effect on potential macron voters . 
  there are still several hours to go . . 
  good points , with which i agree as well . 
  i think the difference here between us is that i do n't see globalisation and in this more specific case , the eu , as threats to culture diversity . 
  the eu does not abolish in any way local autonomy and even if we reach federalisation , this will be restricted to financial , economical , political and security aspects . 
  on the contrary i would say , through eu funding it 's easier for local initiatives to take roots , for local authorities to be less dependent on the centralised country government and do their own projects ( including cultural ones ) , that the local community wants . 
  there 's no requirement for eu members to adhere to the same language or traditions or cuisine . 
  on the contrary : diversity is celebrated and that 's how it should stay . 
  yes , there will be influences among countries , trades of culture so to say , however that 's how it 's always been . 
  the current state of traditions and culture of each states is the result of such trades and influences , it 's not something that started with the eu . 
  regarding the usa example , i do n't believe it 's a very relevant one and definitely can not be compared to europe . 
  that 's because the us is very young and more importantly it started from a common `` ancestor '' . 
  there was never any major diversity to start with , so you can not blame federalisation for ruining it . 
  diversity has actually increased over the last centuries in the us , mostly due to the different resources and geography of each state . 
  why a nationalist though ? 
  to not be confused with patriotism , which is a moderate version of nationalism and in my opinion still makes perfect sense , even in this age . 
  i can understand being a patriot , wanting what 's best for your country , wanting to keep intact the culture of your country etc. 
  but in this day and age , when trade , communication , travel have long since passed the border of countries , with all the tools that we have at our disposal which enable world-wide reach ... why bunker down and raise walls around your country , at the risk of going backwards in time and attracting all the negative consequences of this ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious . 
  and make no mistake , leaders such as trump , le pen , farage are not patriots . 
  they are nationalists , with hints of fascism and a bucket-load of populism . 
  for example a nationalist would not make a distinction between the citizens of that country , based on their race or religion . 
  le pen and trump however do . 
  a nationalist does not automatically promote isolationism , while leaders such as trump and le pen due through promises such as building of walls , pulling out of trade deals and other agreements ( like the climate change one ) , pulling out of the eu and euro without any negotiations , etc. 
  i for example consider myself a full-blown patriot , more so than most of the people my age and that 's exactly why i want my country to stay in the eu and also for eu to continue to succeed . 
  no matter how i look at it , it 's by far the best option for my country going forward . 
  and being part of something bigger does not mean renouncing your own values , your traditions , etc. 
  it just means that you 're part of a team and you have to be a team-player when needed , while doing your own thing the rest of the time . 
  he 's a globalist nationalist , what do n't you understand ? 
  it 's so easy to convince you guys of something , it just takes a single piece of `` info '' . 
  btw , do you want to buy volcano insurance ? 
  anyway , could you tell me 3 issues that make macron extreme right wing and why they are bad ? 
  since you 're so convinced of this and find it so worrying , you should have no problems explaining it to me as well . 
  you 've ignored my other arguments and made a huge thing out of the last one , which again you misunderstood . 
  i of course meant to say that the so called constitutional court does not operate on the same rules and restrictions that regular justice courts do , for the reasons i highlighted , which is why it 's not representative of the justice system . 
  we 're not talking about parliamentaries here , rather about members of the guvernment . 
  oug 13 was a government decree , not a law passed by parliament . 
  the party leader , especially in this case , has full control of the majority of the parliament , which means he can easily force a member of the guvernment out if he wants to . 
  or even the prime-minister . 
  so i fail to see how it 's not possible and how it does n't fall into abuse of power to make the minister of justice put in an emergency decree that gets you , the leader of the rulling party , off the hook in your trial . 
   the dna ( ministerul public ) has no competency in doing a penal inquiry regarding the opportunity or legality of a normative act . 
  basically it 's not their business . 
  you 're confusing terms here and you 're reaching an absolutely hilarious and wrong conclusion . 
  basically , you 're saying that a minister can do whatever illegal shit he wants while issuing a decree , because he can not be investigated for it . 
  does that make sense to you ? 
  if so , i want what you 're smoking . 
  one of the confusions you 're making is that ministerul public = dna , which is not the case . 
  [ ministerul public is composed of many other sections of prosecutors . 
  ] ( http://www.mpublic.ro/ro/content/sectii-componente ) so saying this ministry can not investigate illegal acts committed during the issuing of a law is even more hilarious and wrong . 
  could i commit a murder while issuing a decree and be ablke to get away with it ? 
  apparently so , because the unit of criminal investigation is under this ministry . 
   so this leads me to the next confusion : having no competency in doing a penal inquiry regarding the legality of an act does not mean that you can not investigate illegal actions committed during that process . 
  it only means that dna and other prosecutors can not investigate if that act is legal or illegal . 
  which of course makes sense , but again , that was never the case here . 
   check the report , pt 123 . 
  the dna interviewed a large amount of people , they created a situation of stress and tension in the govt impeding their right to carry on their work . 
  i 'd be stressed as well if i knew i committed illegalities while issuing that government decree . 
  i fail to see your point . 
   just because a prosecutor says something , does n't make it true . 
  that is of course true , however dna has a 90 + % conviction rate sooo , you do the math if it 's a safe or not bet that those illegalities happened . 
  especially if you consider who the suspects are in this case . 
  the presumption of innocence applies and rightfully so in the court of law and when that individual deals with institutions . 
  i however am not in any way obliged to pretend that individual is innocent , when i know better than that what the chances are that he 's innocent . 
   you have a very messed up mentality if you take the word of prosecutors and police above the word of the justice system . 
  what word of the justice system ? 
  as mentioned , the constitutional court is made up of 9 politically named ex-judges . 
  it 's not supervised by any authority , its decisions can not be appealed in any way and its members are untouchable for 9 years . 
  they are not part of the justice system . 
  the investigation was never about the opportunity of the govt decree or its legality , it was about investigating if abuse of influence ( a person that has a lead function in a party uses his influence or authority to obtain unjust advantages or goods ) . 
  the dna started this investigation after it received a complaint , which they 're obligated to follow through . 
  also , why do n't you also post what they found in this investigation ? 
  while the initial complaint did n't confirm ( although it 's clear to everyone that the decree was meant to save the leader of the ruling party from his trials ) , it found a number of other problems : * suspicions of favoring the perpetrator * presentation in bad faith of innaccurate data to the parliament or the president in order to hide the commission of facts capable of affecting the interests of the state * theft or destruction of documents * theft or destruction of evidence during the investigation * intellectual falsification all these were allegedly done during the issuing of that government decree . 
  source : http://www.pna.ro/comunicat.xhtml?id=8044 also , the constitutional court is unfortunately heavily politicized and at the moment the ruling party holds the majority there . 
  so i 'd take any ruling they do which favours the rulling party with a grain of salt . 
  just recently , they postponed 4 times to give a verdict whether it 's constitutional or not to prevent a person from being prime-minister , if they 've been previously convicted . 
  the 5th time they just said they ca n't decide and that it 's up to the parliament to decide , leaving thus the window open for parliament to change the law and allow the leader of psd , the rulling party , ( the same guy for which the govt decree that sparked protests was issued for ) to become prime-minister . 
  even if he 's been convicted for electoral fraud and is now being prosecuted for abuse of power .

  would n't you say ? 
  read my edit , sorry . 
  obviously it 's unacceptable to deport citizens . 
  jesus christ dude you are weak . 
  no wonder these people walk all over you and continue to hold on to their fanatical backward intolerant beliefs for decades . 
  i 've got only 1 message to them ; accept european values , human rights , gender equality , or get the fuck out . 
  edit : p.s. 
  obviously i did n't mean bitch-slapping literally . 
  but ** the moment ** a parent would impose such beliefs on his children i would take his children away from him and put them in care . 
  he can see them and take them back when he corrects his attitude to european laws . 
  simple eh ? 
  no tolerance to intolerance . 
  make germans of them , do n't let them live in parallel societies . 
  watch , the , video . 
  listening to these teenagers i just want to bitch-slap some european values into them . 
  holy fuck this is infuriating .

  after all if a parent educates his children to be criminals , you would take them away . 
  it 's the same thing if he educates them that it 's ok to control and impose your will on `` your women '' . 
  simple eh ? 
  no tolerance to intolerance .

  look , tell me mexicans do this in the us . 
  lol , as i have a lidl nearby my house , this is funny . 
  france not . 
  netherlands yes . 
  there 's also the issue of integration . 
  i would take 11 million mexicans with a smile on my face rather than people of such wildly different moral standards with regard to gender equality , gay rights and so on . 
  how old are you ? 
  please stop with the smileys . 
  like i said , your country is majorly responsible for destabilizing these countries and you are taking in 10 000 * next year * . 
  please , shut up . 
  oh you !, 
  if you think r/europe is right-wing you have no idea ; you should see newspaper comment sections in these countries . 
  we here eastern europeans are actually the more moderate bunch . 
  * to some extent * is not even enough to cover the cost brain-drain .

  give me a break . 
  in romania , both right and left are completely against compulsory quotas . 
  there is nobody i can effectively vote for to express my choice , is there ? 
  yes . 
  ** hundreds of millions ** as the population of africa is expected to quadruple this century which us unrealistic but even if it only doubles that 's 2.2 billion people . 
  is it a hyperbole to suggest that 200 or 300 million of them would flood to europe if it was easy ? 
  you do n't seem to have the tiniest realistic idea about population in africa . 
  just ethiopia alone is 80 million people and the size of germany . 
  there is not a shred of doubt in my mind that at least 10 % would n't not take a boat to europe if they thought it was easy to stay afterwards . 
  apply that to the whole continent , spread it along a few decades and you 'll get to hundreds of millions . 
  ** who would ** . 
  we 'll take in tens of millions this century whether we like it or not , but the attitude of potentially being too welcoming , will decide if they number in the hundreds of millions . 
  effect on brain-drain would have been exactly the same . 
  schengen is only about border checks , nothing more . 
  learn some eu law , whiner . 
  you see , the eu , unlike the us , does n't have an army . 
  the logical thing to do would be to act like the regional power that it is and impose peace and stability on neighboring countries . 
  the more accepting we are now , the more people will start coming , by the millions and by the tens of millions and by the hundreds of millions this century . 
  it 's not just refugees but economic immigrants who would risk their lives as well if they have illusions about how easy life is here and how easy they can get in . 
  it 's not a similar situation . 
  the us was a huge , sparsely populated continent , rich in arable land and natural resources ; currently it costs over 1000euro / month just to house a family of 3 in sweden , and soon germany too . 
  we 're already 507 million in the eu and some 700 million in europe . 
  housing is expensive and with the same money instead of paying for rent for 3-4 years you could build and donate houses and apartments for these people , elsewhere . 
  denied schengen by germany for 3 years after paying over half a billion to a german company for border security . 
  systematically have access to incredibly shitty healthcare because medical staff take jobs paying 10 times better in the west . 
  i could go on about teacher salaries , public prosecutor or judge salaries etc. 
  only germany can lead the eu , because no politician outside of germany can impose anything on germany . 
  it 's not really a matter of choice of who leads the eu . 
  but , that 's fine because after all germany is mighty and they 're a great bunch . 
  unfortunately it 's not very democratic at the moment . 
  imagine if the governor of california could impose shit on all other states while only being accountable to californians . 
  that 's the pickle we 're in currently . 
  i 'm not saying no to any of this , i 'd take in refugees if the majority of europeans wanted to , but in reality it 's the majority of germans , and westerners who want to impose refugees but at the level of the eu they would be a minority . 
  do you see the issue ? 
  the more merkel will push v4 on this matter , the more v4 will stand together in the eu to balance german power , seeing as france is sleep-walking . 
  in my book that 's a good thing because we need a major power in the eu to draw the foreign policy lines we in the east are worried about . 
  it is not . 
  germany will do everything in its ' power to keep it together because they are desperately in need of its ' common market and workforce . 
  and germany is mighty . 
  it just needs to be shown that we 're not all pushovers . 
  there is no change the eu is going anywhere anytime soon . 
  no matter how much we fight with each other and how much we argue our fates are sealed by german might and the euro . 
  i 'm a big idiot , sorry . 
  as if i did n't just see us military equipment rolling through my country . 
  that is quite surprising because a lot of the riots in hungary happen because the immigrants / refugees do n't want to be registered and have their finger prints taken . 
  which is , ridiculous . 
   if you want more russian influence and less eu in your country , go ahead . 
  did he actually say that ? 
  it 's the us that is doing the heavy lifting of holding off russian influence in eastern europe . 
  trust me , the brain-drain is far more costly what what we net in funds from the eu . 
  i am a ** eu federalist ** , but in a federation there are no 1st class and 2nd class citizens . 
  * at the meeting in prague , some countries repeated that immigration policy was a matter of national sovereignty . 
  lubomir zaoralek , the czech foreign minister , said , `` every country has to have the sovereign right to decide who it will or will not accept . '' * until we give up sovereignty and become a federation , immigration will remain so . 
  a proper federal state has fiscal transfer and a federal government . 
  the 1.5 billion / year or whatever we net in funds from the eu in romania , is nowhere near close to fiscal transfer and a eu government . 
  in poland and romania , it is our partnership with the us which keeps us safe against russia , because unfortunately germany treats us more like unequal buffer states . 
  like i said , the eu is not a federal state yet they want to impose shit like it is a federal state when it 's convenient . 
  also when it 's convenient for them , they forget all about eu solidarity and go ahead and strike geopolitical-sensitive gas deals with russia and weaken the position of eastern states . 
  i have no patience for that . 
  plus the way they treated romania and bulgaria on the schengen issue .

  not to mention the tensions between poland and ukraine due to the focus on historical grievances in both regimes . 
  eastern europe has become more like russia , and a result more divided , and poland has abandoned any leadership role in favour of courting the us . 
  which is just another notch in the pis 's belt of regrettable decisions . 
  as an outsider i consider it the party that has done the least for polish security , despite their self-described russophobia . 
  it did n't want to be left outside a new inner circle . 
  the irony . 
  i think we 're missing that there is somewhat of a divide between leadership and management . 
  a manager is perfectly capable of managing day to day activities , but he ca n't set out direction . 
  a leader is in the opposite category , perfectly able to set out a direction , but might fail at the management . 
  the centrist politicians , exemplified by rute , have run purely on management platform , delivering steady but forgettable results . 
  the alt-demagogues are running purely on leadership platforms , and are gaining distance in the vacuum left by the center . 
  people like schulz and timmermans are proposing the restoration of leadership and directions , but to someone who 's used the eu as a scapegoat to excuse leadership failures , it 's a big chasm to bridge . 
  which is toxic since rutte himself has instead embraced the model of wilders to patch up his platform , thinking he wo n't `` pull a cameron '' . 
  heh , you 'd think so reading the anglomedia . 
  lepen wants to , ironically enough considering her party , pull a degaul at reinstitute a form of the empty chair crisis in europe , and bring about another luxemburg compromise . 
  at least that 's what i take from her . 
  but leaving is just , well , it 's in the imaginations of those who dream of fire and ashes . 
  the obvious examples of the hungarian , polish and now romanian governments , which position themselves as `` protectors of sovereignty '' the moment they have their hands in the honey pot . 
  all of the countries have a pro-eu population , at least until the propaganda kicks in like it did in the uk . 
  the eu needs stronger policing mechanism before we add another voting member who wants to join his fellow horse thieves . 
  after entering : serbian government says eu should mind own business , reverses democratic and judicial reform . 
  we 've been burned before . 
  edited some to be more clear . 
  but no , countries do n't care about stuff they do n't see . 
  everything effects them . 
  the migration problem was seen by greece and italy in 2011 , but it only became a german and swedish problem in 2015 , despite the fact that something could be done sooner . 
  this can be applied to the banking crisis , ukraine , and every other geopolitical problem in europe . 
  there are no isolated actors . 
  let 's take migration . 
  the swedish government and the italian government have the same problems . 
  but because of distance , the swedish mod has a blind spot in north africa , same as the italian mod has one in russia . 
  and both have no idea what to make of syria . 
  neither communicate well with each other and respond to different institutions , so their efforts either wasted or at cross purposes as they dump problems on each other . 
  take this , multiply over 27 members and their own internal institutions . 
  there is no `` big picture '' institution , just different people at different distances from fires , largely ignoring each other in favour of what 's in front of them . 
  can you please not involve the eu into these decisions . 
  it 's not the eu that is managing the bailout , or its demands . 
  the greek loan management is handled by the eurogroup through itself and the esm . 
  the last time juncker tried to side with tsipras , schauble talked about how it was n't his job to manage the situation , since the eurozone is a separate institution . 
  the issue of current greek debt is one of intergovermental policy making as a result of the `` answer is n't more europe '' attitude of the early decade , as well as previous demands made by non-euro countries to seperate the organization . 
  source : http://www.politico.eu/article/schauble-european-commission-power-eurogroup-juncker-dijsselbloem-grexit/  during negotiations over a third bailout package for greece earlier this month , sch\u00e4uble cast doubt on the commission 's authority to take decisions and negotiate directly with athens . 
  he offered reminders that it is eurozone member states , as represented by their finance ministers in the eurogroup , who are greece 's actual creditors rather than the commission . 
  i think the inflexibility is overstated . 
  cyprus managed to impose capital control inside the eurozone . 
  romania had to give state employees a 25 % pay cut even though it 's outside of it . 
  i suspect , and i could be wrong , that it 's perception that allowed iceland and then ireland to bounce back , rather than actual economic effectiveness . 
  iceland came out of it with a good reputation , despite icesave , and the promise of cheap tourist deals right off the bat . 
  ireland eventually regained economic trust and saw a laughable increase due to reinvestment and corporate centers moving . 
  meanwhile greece has been actively undergoing a consistent bad-pr program , in which it paints itself as nearing the edge of collapse . 
  the results on one of it 's main industries , tourism , is not surprising considering . 
  the following issues with investment follows that same perceived risk . 
  btw , i 'm gon na have to warn you . 
  if greece devalued like the western know-it alls wanted to , even if it had drachma , it would have had protests and union strikes every month for years . 
  not to mention issues with things like medicine and other imports . 
  we 've been there and done that , and have had less to do than them , and the consequences of devaluation are severely understated . 
  and other states block the things they do want . 
  the reality is that the states have no power to give up . 
  their control is illusory , as their interdependence and size makes unilateral action either be ineffective or lead to a mutual destruction through confrontation . 
  that the true reality , behind the wants and will . 
  that the things they do n't want to let go of , economy , immigration or security , are the very things they are most vulnerable to the international weather . 
  it 's wishful-thinking to think that every montenegro and netherlands is a secret america waiting to happen , a king in their own castle . 
  as a romanian , please do n't do that . 
  you have no idea how much damage a blank check can do in the hands of a political elite dead set on getting elected . 
  the eu 's focus on investment and return is a fairly positive direction , since it gives meaning and reason to the spending . 
  i wish that more trans-national projects were put in place , such as a modernized balkan route , a resurrected nabucco , or massive solar projects , but i would n't like to live in a fully cash-in-hand europe . 
  the issue has always been that even when the brains stayed , the funding and support simply was n't there . 
  too much funding is being kept inside fairly closed circles , and we do n't have a competitive investment enviroment eu-wide , let alone nationally . 
  i 'm hoping over the long term we can recreate the german miracle of decentralization , and start seeing sectoral capitals as people return with the right connections and experience . 
  well , we have a tradition of how that 's settled on this continent . 
  and we all know how these guys love tradition . 
  i fail to see how the failures of intergovermentalism has strengthened the argument for intergovermentalism . 
  it might have strengthened the perception of eu failure , but that perception has been biased by national governments refusing to admit to their own inadequacies both internally and in cooperation . 
  in fact , if looked logically , it has only proven how even relatively simple matters fall apart in an intergovernmental decision making system . 
  `` decision by commitee '' for an entire continent has kept us on the edge , as an internal scapegoating exercise was in progress . 
  the community method has finally been given confirmation with the revival of ecb governance , rather than eurogroup , and failure to follow up will see us return to 5 years ago . 
  the institutional nature of the eu means any treaties are maintained both by the rule of law and the mechanisms of governance , not just convenience . 
  dublin and the eurozone were largely intergovernmental treaties , and were tried to be handled as that . 
  the growing independence of the ecb and the funding for the-agency-formerly-known-as-frontex shows we 're learning that international treaties are worthless and are slowly bending towards the community method . 
  the european treaties are slowly becoming a constitution , and the rule of law is returning to the continent . 
  ohh . 
   i think basic starting line here is for you are not willing to spend money to save greece from dropping into third world living standards ( excuse the hyperbole , but you get the point ) i think you do n't understand how little support greece found in the smaller and poorer states in eastern europe , exactly because of that sort of rhetoric . 
  so no , i do n't get your point , considering my country was on the business end of the esm and imf as well . 
  while i do n't agree with the eurozone organization , there 's a limit to how much i can swallow on that point . 
  we need a fiscal union , but for the sake of sanity , not just one member . 
   well naturally the need is for a structure of some sort , the problems here are political not theoretical . 
  we know the structures that need to exist , their just isnt the will or the trust , to give them that power . 
  exactly , they are political , and that 's the point of the discussion . 
  to present arguments to sway the political position . 
  even as you point out the current state of lack of cohesion and slowness of support , that only hardens the argument for change not weakens it . 
  the status quo is the perfect argument against the status quo . 
  as we 've seen in europe , it 's not that different countries have different needs . 
  our problems and mistake become shared very quickly . 
  the difference is an illusion given by the institutional myopia caused by institutional balkanization . 
  it 's like being in a theatre that 's on fire . 
  the people closest to the fire are the most worried , but the fire will eventually effect everyone given time . 
  but the information does n't travel well across a mass of separate people . 
  mali is also a complicated example . 
  it was largely a clean-up of libyan intervention blowback , in the form of regional instability flowing out . 
  libya in turn was a result of french and italian house cleaning following years of cooperation with ghadafi . 
  and the reason for that cooperation we all see now , as the migrant crisis is happening .

  so everyone wins . 
   well , to be frank . 
  why is n't nato good enough for you ? 
  because the power arrangement is shit , as de gaul already knew . 
  it 's arranged preferentially for us commanders and policy , with everyone else being relegated to a barnacle on their war machine or a battlefield . 
  they will not treat an attack on warsaw or prague with the same seriousness as an attack on anchorage , let alone new york . 
  we do n't really have a vote in nato , it 's an informal meeting of national leaders , we do n't keep minutes of the conversations , and we do n't have a court if , for example , a us commander abandons a romanian brigade in the field ( which has n't happened but do n't want to try ) . 
  it 's basically a continuation of our previous arrangement with the ussr : a nicer form of military vassalage , where the us never asks us to jump as long as we do it out of our own accord . 
  and , most importantly , the us does n't need us . 
  we do n't vote for us president , we do n't add to the us budget , we do n't give anything to it it ca n't take from someone else . 
  we 're disposable , a chess piece , a game board . 
  a eu army would be integrated in the parliamentary and council system . 
  it would offer the opportunity to see romanian and hungarian generals commanding alliance troops instead of just us . 
  it would allows us access to the military industrial complex , and make us indispensable to any war effort by virtue of production . 
  it would tie our votes into a common leadership , our people into a common force , our resources into a common pool . 
  so , in short , nato is just america and it 's will . 
  the eu gives far more strings to smaller countries . 
  edit : also , for full cynicism : we 're less likely to see another german invasion or anything like it from anyone else if we had a force which was composed in majority by non-germans . 
  it would be the ultimate sabotage of any future imperial expansion from within the current eu . 
  this has been the same with the euro , schengen , and likely every organization . 
  support for the organization is always highest in participating countries , irregardless of actual effect , and far lower in nearby countries , who could be characterized as `` free riders '' , but not those in actual need of it . 
  this probably says something dire about human psychology . 
   eliminate corruption and spend more on guns then ? 
  this has been the `` why do n't they eat cake '' line of the defense spending conversations lately . 
  we do n't need guns , we need the sort of equipment that we could only afford to keep in running order and effective at 5 % budget spending and that would give us a force equivalent of let 's say israel . 
  but that does not even begin to buy us anti-missile defenses , satellite surveillance , or any effective way of securing the black sea . 
  which is why we tried to partner up with bulgaria awhile ago . 
  we 're poor , in short . 
  spending more of the little we have wo n't make much of a dent , it 's just going to give someone fancier targets to destroy . 
   i mean i 'm more worried about the fact that dozens of people were murdered by muslims not a half kilometer from me that i am about russians invading an eu country . 
  are you only able to be worried about one thing at a time ? 
  that 's actually a great question , which is rare on this topic . 
  and it 's not just creating wars , it 's also being friendly of saudi arabia because of arms exports . 
  the american 's issue is that over the last hundred years they 've developed legal loopholes from declaring something a war , partly due to their strong presidential system and partially due to the vague wording of what constitutes a valid declaration of war . 
  there 's actually not been a formal declaration of war since ww2 , everything after that are `` authorized military engagements '' . 
  so maybe all we need to to is actually set up a system to not allow this sort of haphazard management . 
  that does n't solve the `` unfriendly friendly diplomacy '' issue , but that 's an issue of employment and money that simply crosses over too many interest to isolate . 
  you start thinking like that and the you spend a hundred years trying to figure out how to reform the house of lords , or a few decades over electoral reform , or years trying to figure out how to properly devolved england . 
  then never really do any of it . 
  it 's best to agree in principle and then crossing bridges as you find them , rather than get stuck doing it the other way around , theorizing over this and that . 
  ee is apparently thoroughly brainwashed after joining them in iraq . 
  before then we were smarter and more skeptical , now we think they 'll come save us like they 're some sort of white knight because they then let us into nato . 
  i think we have this tendency to start inflating our own sense of significance the moment `` senpai notices us '' . 
  this is why we should start putting together work-groups to set out an optimum plan for spreading national and unified power and responsibilities . 
  between the swiss and american historical exemplars we have a lot to get inspired from . 
  we want to avoid american paranoia over a `` standing army '' and where it lead them , forced by history to do in a rush what a sensible country would have done over decades . 
  eu constitutions scares people . 
  it would theoretically give the people and courts more power in the eu , but it 's just such a jarring idea to many and it sets off a particular kind of people into rabid madness . 
  we simply ca n't design the eu from the ground-up as if it was a machine , unfortunately , because of that . 
  sovereignty ideologues constantly get in the way arguing for the status quo . 
  we can only move in directions where their ideology is faced with the burning light of pragmatism . 
  even the euro was like that . 
  i know many people do n't know this anymore , but back in the 1980-1990 it was seen as a way to control the then german dominance in european economies by sabotaging their influence on their national currency . 
  the people who think it was a `` high minded '' project are simply in another head space in regards to the cold reality of european politics . 
  and how does libya fit in that `` natural resource '' puzzle ? 
  my point is that we often tell stories about the purpose of our military interventions , to explain them to ourselves , but in the end they 're not really high minded ideals of self defence . 
  they 're pragmatic decisions based around some complex web of self-interest . 
  and an eu army needs just that , that self-interest . 
  because france will never be more than a mayfly intervention force without it , and we 're never going to be any more than a mayfly defence force . 
  so , at least as far as i 'm concerned , either we both rely on a eu army to patch up our weaknesses or we continue as we have to this day and rely on us money , supplies and direction whenever we 're not playing for the sake of the looks of it . 
  either way , we 're going to be doing things we do n't like `` for national interest '' , but i 'd rather not serve the national interest with someone an ocean away . 
  none of that has an impact on the profitability of factories in germany . 
  if the profitability of industry and manufacturing was inversely proportional to local wages , we 'd have seen german companies be outcompeted by spanish companies long ago . 
  but instead germany has done what , in the uk and us atleast , was considered impossible and maintained an industrial economy into globalization without state intervention . 
  while we do need to restructure worker-employer relationship in other countries to add some protections for our local companies , we can also learn about doing as germany has done and simply transitioning from low to high knowledge industries as local experience improves with investment , thus negating many of the effects of outsourcing . 
  not necessarily , it depends on a lot of factors outside of wages . 
  germany 's wages have been higher than south european wages for decades in the single market , but the concentration of production is still in germany . 
  although this does n't mean they can increase indefinitely , just that they 're only apart of the larger sum that is overheads . 
  alternative title : evil socialist organization sabotages national competitiveness , likely western conspiracy . 
  am i ready for polish politics yet ? 
  you 're pretty much describing the current state of affairs and then saying `` it wo n't be much better so let 's not try . '', 
  and this entire thing about treating a voting organization like it was some sort of muscovite empire . 
  neither france , nor germany have any interest in allowing that to happen , since they would fear it being turned against them at one point . 
  and this new system is qualitatively different from the old alliances . 
  there are votes , there are courts , there are laws . 
  this is not the soviet union , german empire , or austro-hungary . 
  this is our one and only chance to tie our independence and sovereignty as a legal component as part of a multilateral europe , rather than waiting for the next hegemonizing empire to turn up and make us client states in an imperial europe . 
  your argument is to do nothing until then , and just wait to be swallowed . 
  you 're not giving up grounds !, 
  you 're not giving up any independence you 've had so far !, 
  the only thing you , me and the german are giving up is the hope of ever being a world power on our own . 
  but here 's the newsflash : we could never achieve that , and they should n't be allowed to try . 
  edit : i 'll be honest . 
  i 'm getting the impression that most eastern europeans are by nature imperialists . 
  federations and legal structures confuse them . 
  would explain yugoslavia . 
  ok , let 's get something straight here . 
  i 'm am for a parralel eu/national army system , with a 1-1 .5 % gdp per country commitment by law , and only member states having right to conscription or draft . 
  to me an eu army does n't mean giving up squat . 
  secondly , if we 're going to talk history , let me remind you that romania single goal for the past 100 years was survival . 
  we switched sides twice in ww2 . 
  we side with the biggest closest army , because countries that do n't get chopped up into bits . 
  in such a universe we have more to gain from a eu army than letting us play `` choose the sphere of influence '' between the germans , russians and americans . 
  because if it does n't happen then we ** will ** be giving our army to them , wherever they need it , without raising a single peep , as will every other country around us . 
  this is not a choice between independence and dependence . 
  this is a choice between what sort of dependent relationship we want . 
  i want an interdependent one , but apparently everyone else wants a one-way where we are here to serve . 
   all the countries you mentioned have or had a single national identity . 
  pick up a bloody history book at one point . 
  you need it .

  people complain more compared to precrisis times . 
  i did say ** over ** a million and 2.4 is  1, 
  yeah we probably have over a million here , unofficially . 
  you might be the only ones with this problem solved  ) . 
   and the majority is fully integrated in the society . 
  really ? 
  compared to when ? 
  yeah i checked too not there :( i know that sometimes there 's euronews stuff on tvri, 
  ye found this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_association_agreement, 
  no extremists here either the noua dreapt\u0103 is very weak, 
  exactly what is turkey negotiationg for ? 
  afaik most of the interested ones just got romanian citizenship instead of dealing with visa stuff, 
  not here, 
  and which one wants more ? 
   but if you do n't have the channel on your tv do n't worry !, 
  member states show it on state tv , right ? 
  forgot about it :d, 
  he started all this :d, 
  and the 3rd is least important ? 
  yeah imagine the world under russian or chinese hegemony instead of the us it really is the lesser evil imo, 
  and poland, 
  why ? 
  i 'm voting alde too btw, 
  they are n't very visible here so i do n't think people know more than 1968 , beer , porn and havel . 
  interesting thing : their deputy seat is for 1 representative of both czechs and slovaks few czechs here btw a couple thousands or so, 
  a girl in highschool couldnt point russia on the map and the map was big with russia written on it she was looking somewhere west, 
  isnt it central european ? 
  no just for europeans, 
   senate ( '' \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442 '' ) of federation ( most important organization in the country after the government ) declared it 's against invasion into ukraine - it was completely unexpected ; maybe it 's because putin & comrades just decided they wo n't invade so they arranged this so that putin can come say he agrees and then look how democratic he is for respecting the senate,

  it 's one of the most balanced one we have . 
  not to mention they are n't only a news station . 
  b1 is a basescu friendly station true . 
  but basescu is hardly important nowadays . 
  they dislike pnl and usr our main opposition parties and to a certain degree agree with psd on certain issues . 
  basescu has turned against the justice system lately . 
  but i fully agree that they are n't trying to censor anyone . 
  they 're glad to just protect their outlets and let them spew bullshit without fear . 
  same here honestly . 
  i myself do n't really share this sort of humour . 
   `` to win in memetic warfare meme wars are a real thing nowadays . 
  lord have mercy on us all . 
  it 's the same in romania . 
  psd trough allies controls a3 and rtv , who are propaganda outlets for the party . 
  everyone knows they are dictated from above to be very pro-psd . 
  antena3 is basically fox news . 
  romania tv is basically a more moderate infowars . 
  clearly they where not if it 's strongest in eastern europe . 
  concerning romania , it looks spot on .

  i know the parties . 
  i just do n't know what the poll means ... 
  did n't they had elections last year ? 
  i know to little of spanish politics to know what this means . 
  he 's far to left-wing . 
  in my opinion , that will angry corbyn supporters , he is not a '' new '' face at all . 
  he represents the old labour , the labour that could n't win an election in 20 years before blair came and saved them . 
  * sigh * it 's sad to see what 's becoming of the labour party . 
  what do you expect ? 
  the russian ambassador here stated that '' russia brought great wealth to romania and '' gave '' us industry '' you think they are thought back home of the massive purges they commited and murders ? 
  the ethnic cleansing of our german citizens ? 
  the entire family of grandmother died in siberia in working camps , she survived by marrying a romanian . 
  you think they teach them the complete ruin they brought to us by destroying our entire intellectual elite ? 
  we still feel that even today . 
  very well said a romanian poster days ago : '' we had culture once , now we have thieves and manele '' . 
  and this is just us . 
  i do n't even want to bother to go into the stuff they did in other places . 
  there was no '' liberation '' , in 1945 , for hundreds of millions of eastern europeans , just 40 more years of tyranny and dictatorship no different then the fascists before . 
  yeah , that 's it . 
  thanks for explaining it better . 
  i was told once but forgot the details . 
  it 's forbidden like pork . 
  ugh , why remind me that there are '' '' journalists '' '' who would actually write that stuff for some extra bucks . 
  it 's really hard to give a general opinion on the reaction . 
  i speak mostly about muslims here , did n't had so much interaction with the jewish community . 
  most muslims , i would say the majority just stick to '' do n't eat pork '' and perhaps jelly , and do n't really give much thought to how other things are prepared . 
  there are others who do . 
  had a friend while i lived in the uk that always brought his own food when he came to my place . 
  never complained though ... ate free-food for weeks and weeks . 
  and then there 's everything in between that . 
  duck feeding is fine ? 
  most articles are still very decent . 
  they just went to the extreme with clickbait titles . 
  i would guess someone up high told them they need more clicks . 
  sadly i do n't fault them , in this age it 's hard to survive without clickbait ... still they went really far with it . 
  turkeys are eaten on christmas ? 
  why do they keep calling him gay ... this is a guy who wooed a woman , what 15 years or so older than him , when he was under 18 ... 
  saw that . 
  i have nothing against people who voted leave , i know quite a few of them and they are decent people . 
  i also have nothing against brexit or even frexit , i do hate the names though ... 
  it 's a perfectly fine political opinion , one that i disagree with , but it 's completely legitimate and fine . 
  but to compare macron 's victory , or better said le pens loss , to france surrendering to the nazis is simply sick . 
  i 'll post this for those curious . 
  http://pomed.org/pomed-publications/breaking-cycle-of-failed-negotiations-yemen/?utm_content=buffer590d6&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer if people want to now more of the yemeni conflict read this piece by nawda al-dawsari a yemeni herself and well versed in the politics of the country . 
  okay going on a rant here . 
  especially on yemen , well mostly on yemen ... what happened in yemen ? 
  saudi destroying the country just because ? 
  houthis being controlled by iran ? 
  the '' ancient shia-sunni divide '' ? 
  us greedy imperialism ? 
  people who say yemen is a proxy are very ignorant . 
  houthis are not iranian puppets , hell relations between zaidis and twelver shias are very strained , and there is much theologically bad blood between these 2 groups . 
  what happened is this . 
  no us imperialism , no iranian aggression and no saudi aggression in the beginning . 
  the people of yemen revolted against saleh a brutal dictator that ruled since the 60 's , the man that '' united '' yemen with south yemen . 
  after he left power , his 2nd man , took over , hadi , they are n't friends at all anymore . 
  but hadi is the man that basically gave saleh the south . 
  he lost power in the independent sy and ran for the north . 
  saleh basically made him his right-hand man . 
  elections after saleh were just as corrupt as elections before . 
  hadi was the only candidate . 
  hadi betrayed saleh and arranged a behind the curtains coup . 
  saleh fled to the north of yemen were the houthis are . 
  here he started a veritable campaign of destroying hadis presidency and any possibility of governing . 
  the us ambasador was the only man holding everything together . 
  he kept everyone in line . 
  when the obama admin , idiotically refused to extend his term , everything went to crap . 
  saleh had managed to convince the houthis to try and intimidate hadi into giving them more autonomy , something they always wanted . 
  they never fought to govern the entire country . 
  they never wanted this . 
  when they entered saana with tanks they wanted to deal with the government . 
  but saleh loyalists still there forced hadi to flee . 
  te houthis found themselves ruling a city they never desired . 
  saleh now was pushing for the houthis to push south , to take the entire country back for him .

  it 's very difficult to deal with overt and explicit racism . 
  well that is true , no doubt . 
  however , the ignorance in poland ( about romania ) is a lot worse than anywhere else i can think of . 
  edit : i am told it 's the same in the czech republic . 
  fml . 
  that was n't my purpose . 
  it 's not like i have anything to prove to you . 
   so you should treat that poll more like the an answer for question what do we feel for ` gypsy beggars ' and not romanian . 
  that is a fallacy . 
  if poles think romanians are gypsy beggars , then that 's how they feel about romanians , not only how they feel about beggars . 
  if i thought poles are russian alcoholics , then you would n't say `` of but that 's not how he feels about poles . '', 
   most people think you 're gypsies in other words most poles are ignorant racists . 
  ( not that i did n't know that already , but it 's nice to be reminded . ), 
  do n't take that it personally though , i am fully aware that * some * poles are not ignorant racists . 
  edit : accidentally a word . 
  edit 2 : if you 're downmodding , is it because you do n't agree that poles are ignorant racists ? 
  if you do n't agree with that , then what about the comment i 'm replying to ? 
  is it perhaps a lie ? 
  `` it 's been signed '' that sounds like you 're reporting on a football transfer . 
  honestly i felt it was kind of cheesy , and the pictures were n't matched well . 
  you 're not evil , you 're just the naive white kid who went to college and learned that all problems will be solved if only you talk to people . 
  that is one of the new provisions , but it 's not the only one . 
  read the whole article . 
  i do n't understand your comment . 
  you are under the impression that i am opposed to the migration of skilled workers and professionals . 
  i am not opposed to that . 
  on the contrary , i support that . 
  but i also support the migration of gypsies . 
  you , on the other hand , want to pick and choose , buy yourself the nice apples , and throw the bad ones away . 
  and that is not a fair partnership . 
  especially because you will then blame us for not ` solving the gypsy problem , ' as if we knew how to do that any better than you do . 
  sure i 'm not saying turn anyone away , and i understand very well why the doctors are leaving . 
  all that i 'm saying is do n't pick and choose , not if you think of the eu as a fair partnership as opposed to a human grocery store . 
   gypsies 99 percent wont do it ... and everybody knew that when the treaties were signed . 
   it would be much better to treat those people well , talk to them , find out how to reach the roma community in romania , and then use this knowledge to talk to the romanian government because the romanian government is literally made of dum-dum monkeys and they have n't been trying for decades . 
  obviously these romanian monkeys need the great white swede to teach them how to talk to the roma community . 
  it 's just a damn hard problem , and if you bothered to move your precious white ass and learn about it , it probably would n't take you more than two months to turn into yet another neo-fascist . 
  there are plenty of things i dislike about my government , but i can well distinguish between my government and my country . 
  same goes for germany and same goes for the eu . 
   either this is legal under eu law , then i do n't know what your point is . 
  even if it happens to be legal ( on which i 'm no expert ) , the important point is that it 's dishonest and it 's taking advantage of the poorest countries in the union . 
  because our deal applies just as well to doctors as it applies to gypsies . 
  there is no distinction in the european treaties between educated professionals , uneducated but hard-working employees , and gypsies . 
  i am not mad for joining the eu at all . 
  i think the eu is a great idea and i certainly support it . 
  according to germany , gypsies from romania belong in romania , but doctors from romania belong in germany . 
  same for britain , only worse . 
  edit : i will put this here , because it summarizes my reply to many people in this thread . 
  romania has some societal problems ( e.g. , gypsies ) and some societal resources ( e.g. , doctors ) . 
  germany has some societal resources ( e.g. , money ) and some societal problems ( e.g. , ageing population , not enough young doctors for the old patients ) . 
  now germany thinks it 's ok to solve its problems with romania 's resources . 
  but germany does n't think it 's ok for romania to solve its problems with germany 's resources . 
  here 's what i propose : if romanian doctors create economic value in germany and not in romania , then germany can not simply refuse responsibility for romania 's problems . 
  if they want to send the ( non-working ) gypsies back , that 's fine in principle , but then they should also help defray the cost of caring for them , especially because that cost is lower in romania . 
  ( all the same applies for programmers instead of doctors , or for bulgaria instead of romania , or for the uk instead of germany , etc. ), 
   does nato the largest military alliance in the world , need to defend it 's credibility , has anyone questioned our credibility ? 
  yes they have questioned it . 
  the question is not whether nato is large , the question is whether it 's ready to stand by its allies in need . 
  that 's not the same as joining the eurozone . 
  you know what , fuck the european commission . 
  they should know better than to try to sell ` diversity ' by perpetuating stupid stereotypes . 
  with that kind of attitude why do n't they draw a hitler moustache on germany ? 
  at least that would be true history and not a dumb fantasy . 
  we can already buy gas from russia if we want to , so what does this have to do with the number of suppliers ? 
  jobbik are very clearly pro-russian . 
  fidesz are more ambiguous . 
  edit : in fact jobbik like to pretend that they are n't even european , they are ` asian . ', 
  i suppose that 's because the old magyars came from just across the urali mountains . 
  nevermind that the bulk of the hungarian population does not descend from the magyars anyway . 
  yes , and hungary has gypsies too . 
  besides , i 'd take gypsies over nazis any day , they are far less dangerous . 
  bucharest is the safest capital in the eu , and my own city in transylvania is practically the garden of eden , although it does have its gypsies ( who are very peaceful aside from some begging ) . 
  as for war and defending their country , you should know that the hungarian right wing is very vehemently pro-russia , so who exactly would they be defending against ? 
  poland , perhaps ? 
  / r/europe is not a news reddit , though . 
  well hungary has far , far more neo-nazis than we do . 
  but i 'm guessing to * your * mind that counts as ` better . ', 
   and some call us overly nationalistic/xenophobic , tsk , tsk ... you may not be xenophobic toward germans , but many of you are toward romanians . 
  i am romanian and i am not at all surprised to learn that this picture is from bucharest . 
  what do you think is so strage about that ? 
  i 'm not sure i like the way you put it , but you make a convincing case . 
  why you say no ? 
  we too eats potato . 
  yes i know . 
  yay we is fastest growers in eu !, 
   at the end of the 1960s when the romanian economy collapsed under the communist regime no , it did n't . 
  the economy collapsed in the 1980s . 
  it was doing well at the end of the 60s . 
  i do n't anybody who cares , not even a tiny little . 
  i doubt that it 's hate though . 
  well , perhaps there is xenophobia , but p_z was saying that it 's ` just ' xenophobia , not racism . 
  why not ? 
  two ethnicities can both be white-skinned , but still distinct ethnicities . 
  in the nineteenth century there was plenty of inter-european racism . 
  yep . 
  unfortunately european gypsies still obey many of the laws that were imposed of them in india as ` untouchables ' . 
  e.g. , some of the tribes have laws against washing or against working . 
  obviously this seems calculated to perpetuate their exclusion , and it succeeds . 
   it 's implied as he asks of ways to identify the people who look similar to those in your pictures he never even replied to the comment in which i link to the pictures .

  et beijing -- european companies say operating in china is growing increasingly difficult as they battle loosely defined laws , perceived protectionism and industrial overcapacity . 
  the european union chamber of commerce in china , a trade group representing over 1,600 european companies operating in the world 's second-largest economy , said in an annual business confidence survey that the environment is `` increasingly hostile '' toward foreign companies and `` perpetually tilted '' in favor of domestic players . 
  pessimism among european companies operating in china reached an all-time high , it said , with 31 % of respondents bearish about the profit outlook , up 8 percentage points compared with 2015 levels . 
  and 70 % said they felt significantly less welcome in china than in years past , up 7 percentage points over 2015 . 
  particularly negative in their outlook : the machinery , information technology , telecommunications and chemical industries . 
  the results mirror the findings of an american chamber of commerce in china survey in january in which 77 % of companies said they felt less welcome now than a year ago , compared with 47 % in 2015 and 44 % in 2014 . 
  enlarge china 's commerce ministry did n't respond to a request for comment on foreign companies ' perception that operating in china has become more difficult . 
  the european chamber said the difference in operating conditions is significant . 
  `` i see a sea change , '' said j\u00f6rg wuttke , the chamber 's president . 
  `` pessimism is basically far more pronounced . '' european companies surveyed said china has moved too slowly in cutting the number of factories currently producing more goods than buyers want . 
  on monday , u.s. officials urged china to reduce excess steel production they say is fueling trade tensions . 
  `` excess capacity has a distorting and damaging effect on global markets , '' u.s. treasury secretary jack lew said in beijing at the opening of a two-day dialogue between the u.s. and china . 
  mats harborn , executive director of scania sales china co. , an arm of the swedish bus and truck maker and among the companies surveyed , said weak enforcement of vehicle-safety standards in china often favor local players in a position to bend the rules . 
  `` transportation is a good indicator of how china 's doing as a whole . 
  they 've made some progress but it 's far from enough , '' mr. harborn said . 
  `` there 's massive overcapacity when it comes to transportation . 
  it 's quite messy . 
  we 'd like to see proper enforcement so everyone follows the same rules and competes on service . '' while companies in the auto and food and beverage industries reported strong profit growth , the chamber reported , virtually all sectors have been hit by china 's weakening economy , which decelerated to 6.7 % in the first quarter , its slowest pace since the global financial crisis . 
  the expectation is that `` the worst is yet to come , '' the report said of china 's downturn . 
  despite growing difficulties , however , over 85 % of companies surveyed said they were still profitable or breaking even in china , reflecting an official growth rate that remains among the fastest of any major economy . 
  `` even if china 's growing at a slower pace , it 's adding an indonesia every year , '' mr. harborn said . 
  european companies also expressed concern over restrictive internet policies , the slow pace of reform and weak enforcement of intellectual property rights at a time when china is eager to boost innovation and upgrade its economy . 
  `` many companies are hugely worried about involuntary technology transfer , '' said michael clauss , germany 's ambassador to china . 
  according to the survey , 72 % of european companies were willing to invest in r&d in china last year , down from 85 % in 2015 . 
  four in 10 companies in the survey also felt their companies faced discrimination through recently promulgated national-security-related legislation . 
  apple inc. . general counsel bruce sewell told the u.s. congress in april that china for the last two years has asked for its source code , a request the company said it refused . 
  last week , more than two dozen american and international business groups signed a letter of protest against proposed chinese regulations for the insurance sector that they say could result in discrimination against foreign technology companies . 
  so he 's a far right nutjob instead of an islamist one ? 
  russia invades neighbours to distract locals from internal failures, 
   and if their economy was better i would consider it . 
  big if it 's funny how you dont see its the way ur favorite regime works that is making it have weaker economy, 
  it affects the neighbours, 
  oh noes the lizard people, 
  make a bingo pic, 
  i would . 
  elaborate ? 
  hahaha but they wont stop using them cuz they do like mercedes, 
  i like food from all over yurop so i cant pick . 
  same thing in romania . 
  pretty much every recipe is actually foreign especially the more important ones . 
  are you really an arab from iraq or a sockpuppet ? 
   which also would be totally legal at the request of those countries by the way . 
  yea same thing assad did involving putin, 
   it 's the internet , what do you expect ? 
  / pol / trolling in particular, 
  hurr durr but the security agencies do nothing, 
  1/4 of the most important townhalls ( 12/48 ) were won by candidates under investigation or already sentenced for corruption, 
  the extremists just want a safe space of their own nazis were the original sjws, 
  clever, 
  become the hero of pol, 
  intelligence services have become more active in trying to catch guys like these recently but still just 1 group missed is enough to fuck up everything, 
  wait guys only islamic fundamentalists promote stupid stuff, 
  btw turnout like 32 %, 
  i dont remember what happened last time but he will likely be suspended eventually . 
  in valcea won a guy with 2 corruption sentences . 
  he left his party in order to run cuz they dont allow ppl with his problems to but now he will rejoin the party or keep pretending he is independent . 
  this method was common . 
  my new mayor has an indictment . 
  why would romania want to be into such a russia friendly group its worth 0 trust when zeman and orban lead there, 
  yet, 
  same thing happened 4 years ago too, 
  yep now putin can play good , keep what he got , get reward from europe and in the future he can do the same thing again like he 's done before, 
  doesnt seem feasible, 
  it is lots of radicals came on this sub in the last year users with no flairs , usually americans that have n't been active here before but came here to push their / pol / agenda because of the immigration issue . 
  you can see the 4chan lingo is a lot more common here now . 
  and his councilor was kinda critical of junckers moscow visit, 
  why is this downvoted ? 
  are the rightwingers trying to hide this ? 
  it was negative when i posted, 
  yeah its a shitpost if its not another thread about the brown apocalypse, 
  law changed recently for townhall so that its 1 round instead of 2 . 
  he would have had a good chance to win with 2 rounds but now he will likely come 2nd and he doesnt accept being deputy mayor . 
  eh before some special people here get triggered by the l word just know that our left isnt really left . 
  it 's more like say pis, 
  and an eyes hospital chief in conflict of interests just yesterday, 
  yeah much corruption in the medical sector . 
  it 's rotten from the very bottom all the way to ministers , unions , university teachers , college of medics ( the thing that is ie supposed to investigate for malpraxis and other shit but instead they protect the bad doctors ) just 3 days ago prosecutors started investigating 77 oncologists for bribery ( they received foreign trips in return for prescribing certain medicines of some firms ) . 
  we have in total like 200-300 oncologists in the country so imagine the effect when hospitals and clinics are already * very * understaffed . 
  there may be no oncologist in some counties . 
  yeah i know they are farage , le pen , any anti-anything fans too, 
  no thats digimon, 
  did people wrestle for free pans ? 
  where do you see me posting there ? 
   btw , i am prepared to get downvoted because `` there 's not enough evidence '' . 
  you 're at 75 + and people still victimise themselves,

  either way , lynching soldiers who have surrendered is completely barbaric and bad enough from my point of view , beheading or not . 
  have we reached peak erdogan ? 
  well , hello to you too , sir . 
  have a marvellous evening !, 
  human wave attacks , if needed . 
  who cares , it 's easy to shitpost and play armchair general , is n't it ? 
  at worst you get some downvotes , no biggie . 
  you sound like you know a lot about wwii . 
  please , shit more on the french army of wwii , the resistance and their dead . 
  are n't natives the overwhelming majority in all european countries ? 
  i actually agree , these posts do n't make you racist ; we ca n't infer racism merely based on them or at least i ca n't , if i 'm being extra rigurous ( pedantic even , some might say ) . 
  however , some food for thought , maybe ... [ out-group homogeneity effect ] ( http://www.psychologyconcepts.com/outgroup-homogeneity-effect/ ) * outgroup homogeneity effect is a bias where people tend to see outgroup members as more alike than ingroup members . 
  this can make outgroup members more likely to be stereotyped . 
  * different issue , similar result , i 'm afraid . 
  well , that 's nice of you , but given that you apparently care about europe , why are you so happy for hungary to just push them across the border , into serbia ? 
  they 're not in the eu ( yet ) , but they 're still a european country , so what 's your solution in the end ? 
  you already made a blanket statement that they simply do n't belong to europe so , based on that , i assume some sort of sorting facilities abroad are out of the question . 
  correct ? 
  edit : your post has 91 points as of this moment . 
  so much for downvoting . 
  * metric martyrs * . 
  the mind boggles . 
  you sound like a pleasant chap . 
   and all the ` vote leave ' morons on twitter are claiming it 's lies , even tho the information is coming from the police fores around the country . 
  well , clearly the police are project fear . 
  they watched too many serial killer movies . 
  not everyone who despises nationalism `` had antinationalism beat into them '' . 
  it 's more of a rational conclusion that comes with examining its tenets and history . 
  horrible across the board imo , except for slovenia and luxembourg . 
  at least romania ranks a bit better than i was expecting , so there 's that ... 
  beautiful . 
  rip . 
  and apparently you 'll be fucked if reactionaries like this guy above hold any sort of real power . 
  single because you 're not in a relationship or because - you know , with the war and all - your girlfriend died ? 
  no living parents to come with you or they 're stubborn and want to stay whatever the cost ? 
  lost your id or living in a country where id is harder to get ? 
  haha , fuck right off !, 
  i also like how he ignores that in pretty much all wars ( including wwii ) , some people fled and some people did indeed stay behind , although some ( many ? ), 
  did so because they had little choice . 
  romania has `` page 5 girl '' .

  and so , whether you are here to stay , or passing through on your way to parts unknown , welcome to city 17 .

  attack helicopters are n't designed for that . 
  this reply summed it up well . 
  hilariously sad overreaction . 
   it was about some bill in the united states that granted women the right to vote yes , it was about the [ 19th amendment to the us constitution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nineteenth_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) . 
  buzz aldrin was also hospitalised . 
  the mig-21 and the draken had slightly higher top speed , but aside from that , the f/a -18 is a good enough interceptor . 
  with the f-14 long gone , it 's been used in this role successfully by the us navy , let alone canada , australia , spain , switzerland etc. 
  good interceptor and an awesome strike platform proven in combat . 
  it should be noted that : ** 1 ) ** your previous post , which could very well have been the title of an article , uses the plural `` agents '' , even though you 've only referenced one .

  make kartupelis great again !, 
  it 's like watching two edgy redditors . 
  he has a very good brain . 
  people tell him all the time . 
  except french people . 
  they 're dumb . 
  sad . 
   i know a thing or two about france 's military  france could n't fight its way out of a wet paper bag  they 're not good compared to the good armies hilarious . 
  well , for one thing , estonia wants those french troops . 
  i 'm sure that if they wanted russian troops , they 'd kindly invite them and maybe be in some sort of military alliance with them . 
  so ... there 's that ^ and ^ ^ much ^ ^ ^ more . 
  being mean was n't my intention and i do n't see where i insulted you personally . 
  on the other hand , i 'm also not comfortable with waxing lyrically about russia 's `` securing '' of ( ukrainian ! ), 
  naval facilities when what they really did was simply to invade a country and `` take their shit '' . 
  the part where i mentioned whataboutism and precedents should 've been clearer ; my bad . 
  i was n't accusing you of doing it , which is why i said `` even if '' , i was only preempting a potential line of argumentation which is extremely popular .

  are you actually trying to use them as hostages or something ? 
  `` give us free trade or the immigrants will suffer . '', 
  is that it ? 
  that 's disgusting . 
   the perceived slur against jaroslaw kaczynski , head of the governing law and justice party ( pis ) , follows comments from macron last week that , if elected , he would urge the european union to impose sanctions on poland for violating democratic norms . 
  these two bit dictator wannabes are in for a spin . 
  the eu and democracy are in a huge popularity comeback . 
   as queues formed in front of two kiosks selling sandwiches and hot drinks , one man said : `` at least here they sell french crepes instead of kebabs . ''  friends , families and young children were among the crowd , which was made up mostly of young people -- some of whom were too young to vote . 
   `` we are france 's future and this is what we want , '' said one of the girls , from the wealthy area of versailles in the south west of the french capital . 
  what a sad picture ... 
   a huge economic shock would take the uk into recession . 
  that never happened so the british pound has gone up , not down , right ? 
   bro , look at the graphs . 
  it has plummeted right after brexit . 
  it 's still low compared to the pre brexit value . 
  some companies are already starting to move their assets away from the uk . 
  and those that are still investing are doing so because they wo n't be able to do it as easily after brexit is over . 
  consumer goods prices are already up in the uk . 
  this is just the gray bitter silence before the dark storm . 
   yeah , but obviously it 's also the eu 's problem . 
  no , dude . 
  it 's not . 
  the eu has no obligation to protect companies in the uk . 
  the eu has an obligation to protect eu members . 
  giving in to the demands of the uk to have the cake after leaving the party would mean doing the opposite of that . 
  it 's not going to happen . 
  [ first eu response to article 50 takes tough line on transitional deal ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/29/first-eu-response-to-article-50-takes-tough-line-on-transitional-deal )  leaked european parliament resolution puts three-year limit on transition arrangement and says no to free trade agreement in next two years the uk wants all the benefits but none of the responsibility . 
  it will end up with no benefits whatsoever . 
   i meant that companies based in the uk will be looking to sell their goods to different countries first of all , they 're already doing this . 
  secondly , they ca n't afford to stop trade with the eu , even if it will cost them more . 
  after brexit is over , they 'll be paying more for trade with the eu but they will be paying . 
  if they do n't , the eu competition will run them out of business because they 're also doing trade outside of the eu plus trade within the eu . 
   one economic shock ( which we are still waiting for ) is not going to derail the 5th largest economy in the world . 
  you 're forgetting that the uk is still an eu member . 
  the uk still benefits from free trade with the eu . 
  so far nothing has changed . 
  it will soon . 
  and it will be for the worst for the uk . 
  regardless of what deal they manage to get with the eu , it will suck compared to what they have now . 
  it 's only a matter of time . 
   this assumes that trade between the uk and eu stays absolutely static before and after brexit . 
  is this what you 're saying ? 
  no , dude . 
  this assumes that , after brexit , the uk will no longer be an eu member . 
  and , regardless of what trade deal they manage to get , it will suck when compared to what they had when they were an eu member . 
  the uk will pay more for trade . 
  this is not an `` if '' , it 's a `` how much more '' . 
  it 's only a matter of time . 
   it does not logically follow that this is only a problem for the uk brexit is a problem only for the uk because trade will continue no matter what . 
   basic economics tells us that the trade will go elsewhere so that a higher margin can be found exactly !, 
  companies are already moving their assets away from the uk . 
  those that ca n't afford to do this are investing more now in the uk because they wo n't be able to do so as easily after brexit is done . 
  ** regardless of the outcome , trade with the eu will suck for the uk after they lose their eu member status . 
  ** this is only a matter of time . 
  and , as you said , companies will begin to look elsewhere ; away from the uk and within the eu . 
   i hope it 's all for show and he does n't risk real economic harm in europe as well as the uk , just to make his political point . 
  first of all , the uk has more to lose than the eu has because there is strength in numbers . 
  the uk ca n't stop trade , and by having no trade deal in place , the eu will profit off of the uk from all those extra tariffs . 
  either that , or companies will start to move away from the uk . 
  the eu wins in all scenarios . 
  secondly , there is no political game . 
  the only scenario in which the eu loses is that where it makes a special trade deal with the uk without having the uk in the eu . 
  that would undermine all eu member states . 
  this shit will never happen . 
  it 's not politics . 
  it 's common sense . 
  this has been clear from the start . 
  [ first eu response to article 50 takes tough line on transitional deal ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/29/first-eu-response-to-article-50-takes-tough-line-on-transitional-deal )  leaked european parliament resolution puts three-year limit on transition arrangement and says no to free trade agreement in next two years the uk wants all the benefits but none of the responsibility . 
  it will end up with no benefits whatsoever . 
   no trade deal is bad for both sides , not just the uk . 
  it 's actually less of an issue with the eu because the uk will have to pay through their nose to do business with the eu . 
  the uk needs the eu more than the eu needs the uk . 
  the uk has no bargaining chip . 
  the uk ca n't stop trade from happening . 
  and by having no trade deal , the eu is actually making more money off of the uk from all those extra tariffs . 
  thanks , brexit . 
  can we have free trade ? 
  ok , fuck you !, 
   ** every vote for me ** and my local team in this election ** will be a vote to ** demonstrate that ** unity of purpose ** , to strengthen my negotiating position , and to help me secure the best possible deal , '' she wrote . 
  oh , man ... you ca n't make up this shit . 
  it 's like a burglar is talking about the sanctity of ownership . 
  the uk chose to leave . 
  the eu did n't force them . 
  negotiations are happening because the uk asked for them . 
  and they are not going well for the uk because the eu wo n't give them special treatment because they will no longer be a part of the eu . 
  ** the uk stopped being the eu 's problem the moment when article 50 was invoked . 
  ** all of uk 's problems are now their own . 
  people should actually read the article instead of judging it by who wrote it . 
  it 's a valid point , but lots of outlets do great work while having click-bait articles in order to survive financially . 
  edgy teens have temporarily switched from '' < swastika  hail hitler < swastika  '' graffiti to this , as instructed by the leader of their favorite fb page that works at the local foreigner owned deli . 
  true patriotism . 
   if it was only the uk 's problem , why on earth are the eu negotiating ? 
  because the uk started the negotiations when they invoked article 50 . 
  here 's another article on the same story that has the same tone and message . 
  when projecting takes on a whole other meaning . 
   the oecd 's fdi figures included shell 's takeover of bg group , which was announced in 2015 but not recorded in the data until the deal completed most of these deals were announced well before the brexit vote . 
  people here are also forgetting the fact that the uk is still in the eu . 
  brexit has begun , but it 's far from over . 
  you can argue that companies that can not afford to leave are strengthening their positions before the uk leaves because it 'll be significantly harder to do so afterwards . 
   i think it is weird that people are changing their mind now , when nothing actually changed so far .

  it 's cheap for them i guess . 
  some north africans too ( francophiles ) .

  knife ? 
  * scratches knife on wall *, 
  it happed twice to me and always after extracting an archive, 
  but tetris sux, 
  i 'm ok with giving them more power locally but this greater hungary crap coming from orban and his local puppets only make matters worse . 
  we do n't yet have a jobbik type party in our parliament btw , these kind of politicians are still weak and this provocating will help them gain power and in no way help to descentralise which we plan to do . 
  this would only help hungarian populist interests since they will have something better to fight against so win-win for populists on both sides which is what i 'm worried about . 
  even to give autonomy out constitution doesnt allow ( minority rights btw are strong anyway in general ) and we tried changing it a few years ago but too few came to vote . 
  it 's just very difficult . 
  can i have gold ? 
  i know how it is with hungarian top politicians and their sponsored local rightwingers trying to stir shit up especially around elections . 
  i 'm happy ours are n't yet going the same full retard mode to feed the trolling because that would be more destabilising for both sides . 
   you always take info with a grain of salt a very big block in this case,

  it cleared the next day ( i did try restarting and checking for any weird big file with windirstat , ccleaner too ) lol 7zip fanboys downvoting ? 
  looks like a painting, 
  i like stalker too but i havent seen solaris yet i dont like tetris, 
  nice i was actually thinking earlier about making this kind of thread i appreciate the dashcam videos :d if only we had them used more commonly here too . . 
  it talks about a russian made virus, 
  afaik at least in the 90s we had significant trade with them but it went down much in the last 8 years or so . 
  currently we dont even import energy from them . 
  btw permanent bases will be fully ready here in 2018, 
  they are much different sanctions btw with what reason to they suddenly ban food imports from them ? 
  you ca n't explain it because you understand little,

  i wonder if it somehow sponsors nutjobs like alex jones .

  so dont investigate russia because it brings ww3 ? 
  and you figured this out how ? 
  montenegro ? 
  i thought relations between the 2 were changing, 
  maybe it 's trolls, 
  imagine some kind of boardwalk empire tv show in russia with cola instead of alcohol, 
   they will grow also when good infrastructure reaches them if, 
  lots of sh cars from there get bought, 
  i understand nothing, 
  has there been any reaction from the west on this ? 
  beards ? 
  resentful in relation to what ? 
  aliens from mars did, 
  libya , ukraine , georgia ? 
  maybe it depends how well populists next door do, 
   well actually trust it when it comes to issues on west . 
  as if it doesnt have interests of its own against the west too, 
  source ? 
  howd you find out that out of the literally thousands of western mediums it is better ? 
  you trust it when it comes to issues on the middle east wars , israel , iran ? 
  our socialdems play this foreign conspirators thing too, 
   now they are neck to neck . 
  why ? 
  that we have some secret big lasers in the mountains that ceausescu used to fend off the russians that attacked melting their tanks after he rejected invading cz in '68 a different kind of theory would be that the romanian 1989 revolution was more like a coup organised by promoscow nomenklature, 
   switzerland would remain neutral of course . 
  it will be the battleground, 
  o.o we have a dino park ? 
  http://www.agerpres.ro/english http://www.nineoclock.ro/ http://www.romaniajournal.ro/ http://actmedia.eu/ http://www.balkans.com/country-romania_new.php, 
  no the trouble is many in the west have economic and maybe even more ideological interests with russia . 
  that 's why . 
  the way of zorba, 
  nope, 
  duly noted, 
  lets post rainbows !, 
  infesting ? 
  they are few, 
  weird . 
  i 've seen him often in the media . 
  the media shows it because some people do care check out any polls with them, 
  hmm i can then understand that the kremlin is disappointed with the influence gained by putinbots on reddit ? 
  im shocked the guy who wants out of nato wants closer ties to russia btw somebody tell this great leftist that russia is very right wing, 
  id be happy with a live stream, 
  wtf btw lol imagine a french president say hollande do that :d, 
   corbyn falling into the rhetorical trap set up by the russians . 
  falling into as if he does n't know what game he plays ... 
  is this for real ? 
  they are n't a commercial channel ( notice they dont have show pepsi ads and stuff like that , just their own services ) so all their funding comes from the mother firm rds btw they said they wont apply for funding like from that one ponta made, 
  hard to turn like that one reason is they dont depend on making ratings for their money . 
  yeah then it will somehow go full antena3, 
  it 's a lot more than a few cases more than 30 ministers ffs, 
  everyone is nasty in that game, 
  i bet this idiot is an admirer of putin too, 
  some idiots here btw think we are inferior because the rich countries have bigger debts and deficits, 
  we already had a few election seasons with them and they did great its not new anymore, 
  i suspect it was that cabbage meal the poles have too . . forgot the name, 
  its more than eu forcing otherwise bulgaria would do better too now, 
  what games, 
   the big fish in terms of corruption are not yet targeted ... and i do n't think they will be .

  i do n't understand . 
  you ask if people here would complain if a german minister would attend a government session here ? 
  the germans , italians and french mainly for business , fairs , workshops , that kind of stuff . 
  gallup has one showing putler has ~ 87 % approval, 
   russian will eventually come to envy the growth in living standards of their asian and eastern european neighbors . 
  if they can find out about that because that 's what all that heavy propaganda and censorship are for meanwhile russia will continue to try to destabilise eastern europe ( especially ukraine ) like it did in bulgaria with those bank problems a few months ago, 
  % of imports , right ? 
  we also need a map showing how much the imports cover, 
  cool we should see other countries do this, 
  it is uncommon for them to be threatened with nukes, 
  votapmen talks about conspiracies so i gave more ideas again , so far it 's just a bunch of idiots . 
  the rama bit is still speculation . 
  / you really think russia would n't try to manipulate you against each other ? 
  plus they love their trade with russia though i think that in germany 's case it 's about more than trade, 
  it could also be a set up by someone who wants to see rama 's visit be more difficult i do n't see how it would help the us because albania is prous and serbia looks to lean west via eu which is good enough . 
  just a bunch of idiots . 
  maybe it 's from rival politicians in albania . 
  the more nationalist kind which rama does n't seem to be . 
  or maybe from russia who loves nationalism and dividing peoples and putin is gon na visit too . 
  it would help his image of ` protector of serbs against albanians ' see kosovo and make it harder for serbia to lean west . 
  i wonder if putin will say anything . 
  maybe he 'll say something that would just escalate the conflict . 
  again ? 
  very bad ratings in `` political rights and civil liberties . 
  political rights ratings are based on an evaluation of three subcategories : electoral process , political pluralism and participation , and functioning of government . 
  civil liberties ratings are based on an evaluation of four subcategories : freedom of expression and belief , associational and organizational rights , rule of law , and personal autonomy and individual rights . '', 
  from freedom house 's site idk how it is calculated exactly http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world-2013/methodology#.vd12wk3yc70, 
  anybody got pictures of something like that ? 
   but the circlejerk in favour of b\u0103sescu it 's mostly jokes you are exagerating if there 's a bias towards someone then that is iohannis or macovei , definitely not basescu . 
  maybe if it 's something just between basescu and ponta where it 's clear who the less popular one . 
  we 're building lots and lots more churches than schools plus hospitals combined who needs health and education when you got jesus, 
  i do n't think he is allowed to give anything concrete . 
  it 's the prosecutors that should be going for it now . 
  we could just download roads, 
  the president of the parliament 's intelligence commission wants an investigation ( btw there 's the idea here that the intelligence commission is controlled by the services instead of the other way around ) the president himself was accused of being an undercover agent 4 years ago by ex president constantinescu and it 's also been often said that he collaborated with the communist services the justice minister is n't interested in this subject btw it 's about working undercover for the external information service btw who 's head just suddenly quit a week or two ago and runs for president . 
  the president also said that eis 's head ( same guy as above ) initiated the government ordinance ( the gov here often uses ords . ), 
  that extended protection of even the officers that do n't work with the services anymore and it was signed by the pm too . 
  / / his mission was to monitor carla del ponte who was un chief prosecutor for yugoslavia at the time ( 1997-2001 ) / / the pm has n't yet really denied this and has been evasive over this . 
  normally a prosecutor should start an investigation which would be blocked by parliament because he 's also a mp and they rarely allow lifting immunities . 
  the plan was to get strong energy contracts with the eu and then blackmail when needed also work on dividing them by cheaper gas to bigger countries to get their support ie look at germany, 
   in fact , i believe that china has greater interest in europe becoming a superpower than the us maybe yeah but pro beijing , not prous . 
  i think their initial interest to get ties with the west was just faking to buy time to strengthen and plan for what we see happening now, 
  the thing is russia is a problem for us with or without deveselu . 
  it can complain how much it wants which it would do anyway . 
  i do n't think we will see a different view on this in the long term . 
  btw , you are n't romanian , are you ? 
  if you do n't mean us then i do n't see why anybody else matters, 
  they do n't listen to him but they do listen to merkel who was against expansion ( new bases ) last summer there were talks about making new bases in eastern europe but there was disagreement ( merkel cares a lot about putler 's interests ) so all we got after the nato summit was that rapid reaction force these shields are something else and have been close to completion already does anybody remember who else was against this ? 
   people will be pissed that the base is there . 
  if you mean us then you 're very wrong, 
  do you know from who ? 
  is china the main investor ? 
  [ mici ] ( http://nicubunu.ro/pictures/photoblog/img_4680.jpg ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mititei, 
  hmm you add milk and raspberry jam in that cabbage thing ? 
  we make it without that it 's the same as the cabbage rolls but with shredding the cabbage instead of making rolls, 
  some kind of germans http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swabia, 
  yeah, 
   the pm distanced himself from the discussion . 
  only after a few days when it became obvious that their attack does n't work well both the spokesperson and the pm ( part italian ) pretend to be very family oriented ( also focusing a lot on being christian orthodox and romanian - iohannis is a local catholic schwab and playing this card is very important for them in these elections ) and they got a lot of criticisim because it 's far from true ( the spokesperson 's son failed all his bacalaureat exams - in language and literature he got 1.2 / 10 or something , 5 in the other 2 exams and the pm got a new wife soon after the son he had with the first one was born - he obviously cheated ) a complaint at the antidiscrimination court was made on the spokesperson 's name another piece of propaganda against iohannis coming from that spokesperson this week is that he was involved in a shady child adoption scheme with no details given, 
  so did putler get the nobel prize for peace yet ? 
  iirc they wanted to close down a gulag museum did it happen ? 
  yep mostly from dugin, 
   that 's the fault of our administration and the incapable current socialist government it was bad before the current one too , actually worse iirc . 
  i do n't really think he 's that rational . 
  this is overrated and suits propaganda , you know : do n't protest to replace putler or worse will come . 
  i mean this is just discouraging reformists . 
  his comment alone in op shows that he is far from being so smart . 
  how is having a missile shield here fucking us up ? 
  already happening that was what their recent banking crisis was about http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28033614, 
   what is the problem with ttip and ceta ? 
  i do n't really know and all this fearmongering on this subject really is n't helping . 
  there are very valid reasons to be wary of russia and for china i have n't seen any propaganda against it . 
  what do you think china would do if their nuclear company here would be investigated ? 
  i think it could be just like russia and lukoil . 
  haha yeah it 's why they are getting closer to the west in the first place, 
  just to show that lukoil being investigated disturbs them, 
   the idea of collective purchasing for jointly-negotiated energy contracts with russia has not been supported by the eu 's energy commissioner guenther oettinger who said , ` gas is a product , not a weapon ' . 
  link ? 
  how is it the alternative to ` completely depend ' on the us ? 
  there are plans for more than energy union there 's shale gas , nuclear , 3 pipelines going through greece that will supply the eu with ~ half it 's needs ( ask neutrolgreek for details ) . 
  there 's a lot we could do besides us lng and even if we could completely depend on them it would still be better ( or less bad ) than relying on russia, 
  hehe be happy it 's not russia doing it like in other eu countries, 
   usa is n't allowed allies . 
  and viceversa hurr durr puppets of the us, 
  the authorities here are ok with this people here in general like nato, 
   nato missile shield, 
   cernavoda the town 's name is derived from the slavic ( more precisely bulgarian ) \u010derna voda ( \u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430 in cyrillic ) , meaning `` black water '' . 
  this name is regarded by some scholars as a calque of the earlier thracian name ax\u00edopa , from ie * n.ksei `` dark '' and up\u0101 `` water '' ( cf. 
  avestan ax\u0161a\u0113na `` dark '' and lithuanian \u00f9p\u0117 `` river , creek '' ), 
  i mean politically . 
  i wonder if they would try to blackmail somehow in the future . 
  now if only some of the bigger countries grew some balls too, 
  so that 's why germany is acting like it 's switzerland, 
   thank god we have none of these extremist ecologists here like in germany . 
  not yet but we kinda have them when it comes to shale gas it may be too late in the case of new reactors for them to have influence i 'm a bit worried about having china owning them . 
  idk how reliable it is and i 'd guess they are more or less like russia . 
  what a prick, 
  apparently lukoil will restart the refinery today ( so they are worried about being taken over ) the government said they do n't want to do that they 've ( lukoil * ) put it off as a threat because prosecutors are doing seizures ( some partially lifted after just 1 day . . iirc in the day when the pm criticised the prosecutors - or the day after ) both the high court and the general prosecutor have criticised lukoil for it 's comments the pm has reported to some foreign embassies the declarations of the president ( not sure why and we are in election campaign right now - the pm is one of candidates ) he sees them as attacks on the justice system ( in reality it 's the pm that has problems with it and the president is the one supporting it ), 
  kinda hard to pick i 'll go with iliescu, 
   and the balkans . . any balkan states in the eu should leave and others should never be allowed to join .

   if somebody is begging for money i will give them what spare change i have . 
  i think this will do nothing but encourage this phenomenon . 
   whatever they use the money for , at least when i give money to them i know they get the money they mostly get jack . 
  it 's passed up the organizational structure . 
  if what i saw this summer in venice is anything to go by - quite different from the begging in romania i must say - , the begging in western europe is a very-very organized scam . 
  you are not helping the lady you are giving the money to . 
  scrap iron . 
   roma do n't want to live in houses funny , given how many of them live in houses . 
   like the name implies a federation of two states , bosnia and herzegovina actually the two states are `` the federation of bosnia-hertegovina '' and `` republica srpska '' afaik . 
  bosnia and hertegovina are just the two historic regions that make up the state , and fo not overlap with the political entities . 
   or french is the 1st most common studied foreign language ? 
  most likely this . 
   eventhough it 's mostly fun and tease now . 
  not in the east it ai n't ... 
  tomorrow in the news : `` more austerity for latvia , says merkel '', 
   dog shit , really ? 
  that 's a major point in paris ' disfavor ? 
  come on . 
  sounds like [ paris syndrome ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_syndrome ), 
   reportedly , it 's hard to get started as an independent architect . 
  it might be prudent to look into employment at an architect 's office first . 
  oh , i 'm not even contemplating doing it solo until i have some more years under my belt and a firmer grasp of the technical vocabulary in the local language ( and a firmer grasp of the local language generally ) . 
  i 've looked online for job ads , and found a couple ( one near kotrijk ) , baring the fact i ca n't speak dutch ( yet ) . 
   in addition , expect a gradual shift towards adapting existing buildings rather building new ones . 
  yeah , it 's a trend all over europe . 
  fortunately i do have some experience with such work . 
  thanks for the tip though . 
  [ comment on r/science ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1nz5hb/peter_higgs_and_francois_englert_win_nobel/ccne7vd ) :  can say that lots of my colleagues at cern are smiling this afternoon :-), 
   both flanders and the netherlands are doing fine too . 
  i 'm not too sure about the netherlands but the it sector in flanders has been steadily growing . 
  the services sector is quite big here as well as the petrochemical one in areas around antwerp . 
  any idea about the building sector . 
  i 'm an architect and i 'm interested to move round them parts ( antwerp ) in about a year . 
  i personallz prefer ` yurp ', 
  probably the liberals . 
  while i would n't be caught dead voting for them on the national level , their euro mps , especially [ renate weber ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/39713/renate_weber_home.html;jsessionid=6b5861c2aeaef17fdbfdbfb1cfd2ea31.node1 ) , are quite to my liking , and have done a good job in brussels . 
   like in denmark you can not have \u063a\u0632\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u062c\u0627\u0648\u064a\u062f on your driver 's license so i do n't know why turkey has to accept another set of script . 
  arabic and danish are two different scripts . 
  kurmanci and turkish are two variations on the same script ( latin ) . 
  the situations are not analogous . 
   i do n't know why turkey has to accept another set of script . 
  it 's not about accepting another script . 
  it 's about not banning 3 letters of the latin alphabet . 
   by the way , does romania allow the use of hungarian letters like \u00c1 , \u00c9 , \u00d3 , \u00d6 , \u0150 to accommodate its largest minority ? 
  i do n't know . 
  i actually tried googling to see if it does , but did n't find anything . 
  also , do n't asume that if romania does not allow these leters , i agree with it . 
  plus the fact that \u00c1 , \u00c9 , \u00d3 , \u00d6 , \u0150 , \u00da , \u00dc , \u0170 and \u00cd can be replaced with a , e , o , u and i in a way in which x , w , q can not . 
  there are orthodox churches which belong to various eastern european churches , but there is no `` belgian orthodox church '' in the same way there is a `` czech and slovak o.c. '' . 
  that was my point . 
   who made this map ? 
  source given over at r/linguistics : http://www.radicalcartography.net/index.html?alphabets  i am detecting a bias tbh . 
  yeah , seems quite `` cyrillocentric '', 
   i could understand it , if it was a completely unrelated alphabet like amharic or the arabic abjad , but cyrillic is pretty related . 
  so is the arabic script actually . 
  well , as far as languages go , georgian is unrelated to indo-european languages ( it 's part of the kartvelian language family ) , but armenian is very much an indo-european language . 
  but the current topic is writing systems , and afaik , both the armenian and the georgian alphabets are derived from the phoenician alphabet , just like the greek , latin and cyrillic alphabets . 
  i said it was active now , and was refering to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_and_slovak_orthodox_church ) . 
  you said `` there was no orthodox church active in the czech lands until 19-20th century '' which does n't negate my point , that there is one now , in the 21st century , small as it may be . 
  i did n't bring up 9th c. moravia . 
  i know . 
  plus hungary has no comparable orthodox church , so why it 's painted that way is beyond me . 
  but my feeling is that it 's related to current churches , not historic ones . 
  yeah , it lacks many letters , plus the armenian and georgian alphabets , which many would consider `` european alphabets '' as well . 
  does n't say it has to be significant . 
  i agree that it gives undo weight to the orthodox minority , but the truth is that there is [ an orthodox church covering the czechoslovak lands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_and_slovak_orthodox_church ) which uses cyrillic in liturgy . 
   there was no orthodox church active in the czech lands until 19-20th century . 
  that is irrelevant . 
  re-read the map and the comments in this thread . 
  most probably has to do with the orthodox churches active in those regions , not with 9th c. great moravia . 
  might be something related to the [ polish orthodox church ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_orthodox_church ), 
   you ca n't be a black native american because that two label generally has a racial requirement . 
  [ you kinda can ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_indians_in_the_united_states ) . 
  a lot of countries address this issue by having `` letters x , w , q only used in loan-words / words of foreign origin '' , so this way all the letters of the latin alphabet are there . 
  hell , even turkish uses the letters , unofficially . 
  says so in the article . 
  so the question is why should n't the letters be included in the turkish alphabet , when they are already used as it is, 
   ... and we had a magnitude 5.5 earthquake last night which woke up the southern and eastern parts of the country at 4:40 in the morning .

   i do n't know about the separate teaching , but it might have to do with an existing language barrier . 
  this happened to children pf romanian-speaking roma as well , where there is no language barrier .

  it 's not a matter of either/or . 
  get your head out of farrage 's ass and use that racists neuron to think . 
  your problems can * t be solved by the eu because you are to stubborn , our problems can because they are just a matter of local incompetence and indifference . 
  your position is literally : if we have issues it 's not fair that romania has fewer issues . 
  not if the bar is low enough . 
  it 's like the 3 % inflation rate , just less controversial ( there are some benefits to a inflationary policy ) , you can decide to go under it if you want , it 's a target , a guideline for optimal results . 
   would countries in north west europe which are quick at insolvency and resolving contractual disputes need to make any changes at all ? 
  no , the principles would actually be based on their procedures . 
   would the uk for example be able to make changes in the future to its own system to make things even quicker ? 
  yes , the prinsiples are meant to establish a reasonable minimum quality . 
  the uk would be discouraged however in creating a more ineffective system that would allow for more companies to stay afloat in the case of a lack of market liquidity ( but with modern banking systems that is highly unlikely )  in my mind it is somewhat hard to put in place european legislation / systems in this area which only impact eastern and southern europe , without also impacting north west europe . 
  in the last 10 years we reformed our tax and justice system massively and not only legistlatively , but structurally as well . 
  western countries barely did anything , because they already met the minimum requirements . 
  the same thing would apply . 
  and unlike a fiscal policy , there is no debate over what is better , the only debate is over how important the business enviroment should be in terms of goverment priorities . 
  this is how you get integration , by slowly raising the minimum requirements , putin outside pressure on the slackers and forcing them to govern well . 
  that is why we wanted to be in the ue in the first place , we never really got any money , our absorbtion rate is pathetic , we wanted someone to bullly our goverment into governing . 
  post 2008 the focus has been on clashing ideologies instead of focusing on real progress based on the things we agree upon . 
  the eu does not need to be forced into unification , there is to much resistence and this policy will break it appart . 
  the eu needs to refocus it 's efforts on conversion , solidarity and respect for our divergent views . 
  greece did not cause the meltdown , the eu and the ideologists allowed a weak and structurally unstable greece , ireland and spain to be vulnerable . 
  the ideologist focused on compliance and integration over safety and structural stability and that bit them in the ass when the international storm came . 
  and the sad part is , the ideologist still control the parliament , more integration trumps addressing individual national issues . 
  and when they do get adressed they are framed as for the good of the union insted of being a dialog with the good of the citizen in mind . 
  everytime you specify a gender in a law you are creating a sexist law . 
  enforcing parity is sexist . 
  give the people the choice , the option and let them decide , do n't force and create social experiment so the bottom line is politically correct . 
  traditional gender roles are bullshit , but so is the eforceable unisex gender uniformity feminists are pushing for . 
  women care more about their kids than their jobs and men are better , more ambitious , more competitive , more productive and less distracted workers . 
  that is not a rule however so the best course of action is to let the couple choose who does what . 
  not establish laws that go contrary to our instincts and enforce a desired behavior for the sake of the politically correct bottom line . 
   cultural factors as well as rules . 
  i agree , for the enviroment per se where individuals have a lot of variance in behaviors , but when it comes to a higly structured enviroment like the courts , it 's just a matter of how well tough out your laws are . 
   there is a lot more that could be done in some parts of europe here and that would be very welcome . 
  that can be said about everything , but this particular field is easy to enforce , does not imply any sacrifice from the developed members and actually decreases the social and economic gaps between mebers effectively . 
  i do n't think the courts are any different , the process is just streamlined by law . 
  i 'm not really advocating for a unified system , more of a enforcement of principles . 
  i think it would be less invasive as a unified fiscal policy and more productive in the long term . 
  they do n't do that because if it does n't directly effect the polls they do n't give a fuck . 
  the meet with the business association once in a while they promise them they wo n't raise the minimum wage and when they do raise the minimum wage the lower taxation and they are usually done for that electoral cycle . 
   why is it denmark 's and britain 's responsibility to ease the cost of doing business in greece and romania and reduce our own comparative advantage over you ? 
  stop the paranoia right there , i did not say anything about paying for anything , having a unified policy on small businesses would not require you to do anything internally , it would just force our goverment to give a shit about our businesses . 
   romania : all the ease of doing business in britain , no expectation of high wages not really , foreign companies have quite a easy time over here , our goverment is so whipped we bend over backwards even for small companies . 
  the primary beneficiaries would be local companies . 
  that literally does n't cost you anything , and by increasing our purchasing power you basically create new customers for your businesses and more expensive products . 
  the west already has a effective system , forcing eastern governments to focus and bringing our bussined enviroment to a civilised level would have no adverse effects on westerners . 
  just like the justice system reforms we undertook did not change your justice systems . 
   it 's perfectly legitimate for it to attach some requirements to them as well yes , but those requirements are sexist and arbitrary , they are based in cultural prejudice . 
  take it or loose it not a choice , unless you hate your kids/family . 
  nah , the system is putred , whatever we do is just a small hump on the road to `` progress '' . 
  we ask for this kind of shit everytime we vote for `` prosperity '' we complain about jobs , gdp figures or when we buy stupid shit we do n't need . 
  if you want perpetual growth , there will be sacrifices made on our behalf by our rulers ( so they can keep their power ) . 
  we push them to do these compromises sacrificing long term stability for short term prosperity . 
  it is not in human nature ( western human nature ) to say `` enough , i 'm good '' until we ca n't get more and even then we sulk and are frustrated at ourselfs or angry at the system because we ca n't have more . 
  stop countering my arguments with the clasical liberal rhetoric . 
  i am not arguing you should n't pay for children , quite the opposite among most goverment expenditures i think childcare is severly neglected and kids would benefit more from it that they do from money spent at the university level . 
  i am against creating a specific policy to keep men at home for `` parity sake '' . 
  make the current laws voluntary and interchangeable between genders . 
  now this is an area where a unified continental policy would really help the easterners and southerners catch up to the west organically with literally no cost to the west whatsoever . 
  streamlined legislation and a lot of liquidity in the market would be my guess . 
  that article scared me , if mothers  can leave employment or reduce working time after childbirth and receive a flat-rate childcare benefit for up to three years . 
  and the they want fathers to work less with :  the introduction of individual `` use-it-or-lose-it '' entitlements to short and well-paid leave could be way of enabling more fathers to take a fair share in looking after children . 
  who the fuck is left working and gets to pay for all of it ? 
  because companies that have the political power to influence the talks do not deserve even more foreign influence . 
  things are awkward between us since i fucked his wife , so that 's not really an option for all of us . 
  i hate putting my address in these things, 
  fundamentally trade agreements create a context where governments are forced to support foreign companies at the expense of the well being of the population . 
  it has nothing to do with actual trade ( aldough it does increase it , that is just a side effect of opening up the internal market in general ) . 
  it is a politically enforced form of international protectionism for the companies that have strong political ties with the goverment and way to coerce smaller countries and it 's population into economic submission . 
  the economy adapts to the new economic foreign influence and if you break the trade agreement : like not wanting to privatise water distribution you get the all of the benefits that came with the trade agreement ripped out of your economy and that is devastating and basically cripples your trade and bottom line . 
  it is basically economic colonialism reinfoced with a the threat of a economic blockade . 
  it is not lasair faire , it is one of the worse ways to increase trade and it only really helps those that already get a lot of political `` help '' , helping the big get bigger , this time over seas . 
  france confuses me , wtf happened there ? 
  is there a goverment policy in place or it 's just statistical anomaly ? 
  yes , but as you see with the top comments karma , people love to be irrationally scared and agitated over fragmented information rather than be objective and distant over facts . 
  now if you are the editor or you could sale advertising according to your karma , would you encourage reason or would you milk human nature for karma and revenue ? 
  ... well you can have a peace time shaky economy or a war time minimalistic focused economy , what do you really prefer ? 
  not really , being rude caused a lot of wars , sending home a foreign diplomat is considered offensive . 
  primarily the rules are the same as between people because behind the positions they are still people . 
  yes , it is . 
  rules and regulations are structures in such a way that takes into account the wishes of the big guys . 
  think of a airline tax , they wo n't take into account the wishes of quatar air or their business model they will write up the law with american airlines consultant so it wo n't strain their business model . 
  and over time this makes the heard thin out . 
  combine that with a anti trust autority that believes a company with 20 % market share should merge because `` they are struggling to keep up with the need of the market '' and wihin a generation you have oligopolies , systemic monopolies or cartels in almost all industries . 
   companies can last if they are forward thinking . 
  please make a distinction between practice and teory . 
  yes , every ceo born after 1960 knows that to be true . 
  but in life you go the easier route , especially if you have stock holders that do n't want to gamble . 
  and being in a trade association , tacitly fixing prices and splitting the market equitably guarantees more stability , and profits than inovating . 
  if someting disrupts the market you create self regulations that limit the ability of outsiders to enter the market . 
  if market forces shake your cartel , you lobby the goverment to intervene `` for the jobs '' or for the job `` creators '' accordingly to who happens to be your districts political color . 
  ge reformed massively at a point where even a diversified portfolio and a monopoly could not support the amounts of corporate fat it had to carry around , it is the equivalant of a morbidly obese guy having gastric bypass surgery . 
  surgery is not a healthy practice , it is a desperate last hu-raa . 
  also , if ge had lasted 15 more years , the goverment would have intervened . 
  the notion of to big to fail , which is just blatant interventionism and protectionism masked with scare tactics , only appeared about 10 years ago . 
  i do n't know what issues you are reffering to , siemens is for the most part just a normal multinational corporation , growing globaly more than internally . 
  you can argue that it overextends but they are doing okay , all things considered ( they do n't have a huge home market base structurally enforced that can support their international projects like american corporations ), 
  sily hungarians , you think a authoritarian figure like orban gives a shit you do n't like to pay . 
  this is why a wobbly incompetent political class is better than a colossus . 
  if it becomes disruptive you can bring it down .

  it 's not like it is n't already happening with existing members , i can only imagine what they 'll get away with away from continental oversight . 
  home country , i 'm active during election , thanks for reminding me i should get a party membership . 
  current country , i 'm a member of the centrist liberal party . 
  i 've learned to stay out of politics most of the time by now , been on the loosing side more often than not , and it 's stressful . 
  next country i go to , i 'll stick to volunteering , you can feel like you 're making an improvement that way instead of re-enacting sisyphus . 
  this is the issue , we 've assumed that societal participation is inherently economic participation , but it 's far from it . 
  me working in a cafe does n't actually help me make friends , or learn about the country , give me a feeling of actually being a local , or give me pride in what i do . 
  people require meaning , a sense of importance of belonging , and a symbol of their non-selfish participation in society . 
  i 've travelled a bit , and for me this has been an issue . 
  i 've tried volunteering the best i can , but that has always been a bit hit and miss . 
  i 've also participated in university clubs because their main reason for exisiting is to give people who 've just moved in to study a place to socialize and , you know , do stuff . 
  if i was christian , and this is something i suggest to anyone who is , i would 've joined the nearest church and started going , well , religiously . 
  but all those solutions are hacky , non-obvious attempts at trying to integrate yourself into the social fabric . 
  it 's not enough , especially when you 're dealing with people who never tried before . 
  the biggest complaints of african and middle east migrants is that they do n't know what integration means or how to do it . 
  the fact that they then gravitate to enclaves and mosques is unsuprising considering this . 
  all of europe has to take another approach to social cohesion and meaningful participation , especially as the shallow economic participation of the `` me-first '' society is going to die out with automation . 
  in this , the conservative/reactionary desire for family/religion/militarism has an advantage as it speaks to that neglect . 
  got to love the biological mutualism of it . 
  the territories give the uk government deniability , and the uk government creates favourable regulations for the territories . 
   as far as i know the dutch position is `` we will stop once we make eu wide regulations . '', 
  we are fine with stopping it all together as long as everybody else does the same . 
  as someone currently interested in the european public prosecutor office , i 've been tearing my hair out listening to your government . 
  it literally does n't want it to happen , and if it does it does n't want it to manage inter-state tax fraud . 
  i do n't know what you 're hearing in nl , but on the european stage they keep suggesting weak `` would n't it be nice '' regulation , while preventing concrete move to fighting fiscal fraud . 
   he also makes an appeal for progressive patriotism which is to say that national pride and identity is something which is part of the progressive movement . 
  newcomers should accept basic values such as freedom of speech and religion in order to be accepted in society . 
  progressive patriotism has been a component of the liberal/left wing movement since the american and french revolutions . 
  the actual debate has always been one of exclusive vs inclusive patriotism , usually exemplified in europe and america in the form of ethno vs civic nationalism . 
  i 'm glad to see someone picking up the standard again , but he ca n't do it without accepting the endemic failure in western societies : the inability of someone who wants to participate in society to find avenues to do so . 
  modern society can be a particularly isolating experience , and left wing/progressive leaders need to make a more fundamental case for a participatory society if all their other platforms are to succeed . 
  citizenship costs 1000 pounds if i remember it right , which is a pretty penny . 
  same reason why the mona lisa is considered some masterpiece , andy worhol was right , and damn him for it . 
  anybody who was in scotland years ago , knows it extends beyond the news website . 
  [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/enrddaf3uss ) 's a bbc news report on an alex salmon press conference , [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/rhmlb-ribrm ) 's the actual moment of the press conference . 
  there might be a left/right balance being kept , not saying there is n't , but when labour and conservative supporters in the bbc find common ground on a bias , they push it . 
  with political editors such as nick robinson and faces such as jeremy paxman , i can only imagine the constant struggle of the bbc to stick to the left of people like andrew neil edit : oh , forgot robert preston , how could i forget robert preston , the man who destroyed my faith in the bbc . 
  likely same stylistic choice as the pompidou center . 
  neoclassical is like a rash you can never get rid of . 
  it always comes back periodically to signal the decline of any actual artistic or functional merit in the field . 
  once , just once , i wish someone would try to bring back art deco , or even gothic , but no . 
  none-the-less the tool is there . 
  and you 're right , france might take insult to it . 
  unless it 's linked to giving strasbourg the european medicine agency , as it already requested . 
  it 's a weird initiative to make , but it 's there to be made . 
  actually gave this some thought . 
  best way is media attention . 
  do you think a european citizen 's initiative on this would be popular ? 
  the darker elements of the pegida network , the austrian identitarians and , for reasons that still escape me , the people in die linke might do it for free and eagerly . 
  i do n't believe any agency that gave andrew neil the brexit interviews can be called `` pro-remain biased '' . 
  my two cents . 
  what can i say ? 
  nature has provided us with a dark sense of humour , and a very clear sense of history . 
  they 'll point that it 's the bbc , which is never possibly biased . 
  next up from them : `` british economy still splendid '' , `` scotland is poor and snp are useless '' , and `` look how we 're not paying any attention to northern ireland , ho hum '' . 
  would n't be surprised if it 's now technically classified as a lake , and no longer appear on non-topographic maps . 
  ok , i 'm not disagreeing , in fact it advantages me because local companies usually have survived through corruption rather than competence . 
  but there are larger issues linked to the benefits of existing industries to leverage markets of scale , while nascent industries in eastern europe flounder trying to start up , and how that entrenches a system where eastern europe is a customer market while the revenues are taxed in and benefit germany . 
  just fyi , to round out the debate on how that is perceived . 
  ok , a few months into his term , what is the feeling on the ground about thus guy ? 
  being against the travelling circus , is n't being against france . 
  it 's being against waste . 
  and while i have no attachment to belgium , i recognise that keeping the meps away from the other institutions might not be a good idea . 
  edit : actually , i do n't even get how i `` shitted on france '' . 
  labour pretty much takes the regions it does well in for granted . 
  people there always vote labour , because they 'll never vote conservative , party tribalism being what it is especially after thatcher . 
  so they can do whatever , and not fear getting outvoted . 
  the joke is you can put a red rosette on a monkey , and still get them elected . 
  every person who wants to milk the public budget goes labour knowing this , so that 's who they get . 
  because of that labour regions are infested with incompetence , petty rivalries and outright corruption . 
  i 've seen it in scotland , where edinburgh had 3 different corruption issues in 3 years ( garbage contracts , building repair contracts , and the tram ) , and in [ glasgow ] ( http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14536336.investigation_into_allegations_of_council_corruption_intensifies/ ) it 's outright endemic . 
  on the scottish stage , all the good labour politicians have head to westminster to continue their careers , everyone left behind is the bottom of the barrel and the last 4 scottish labour leaders have had little going for them except pity . 
  i could go on , but that 's the short of it . 
  the british have achieved more than you give them credit for . 
  they were key in separating the eurozone from the eu , who 's result we 've seen . 
  they were also key in steering common security measures away from europe , and towards nato/five eyes . 
  and the desire for consensus politics can not take priority over doing what must be done , and saying what must be said . 
  the call for `` consensus politics , not divisiveness '' in europe , has in many ways become a request to do nothing . 
  we 've seen top politicians from italy , germany and france come to the defence of russian policy . 
  and we 've seen no response to the macedonian interference . 
  the interest of russia is for core europa to discconect from the rest of the continent . 
  to this end , the politics of core europe will likely become one of `` perpetual forgiveness and blindness '' , as russia keep `` securing it 's sphere of influence '' and the rest accepting that it costs too much to do anything about it . 
  meanwhile , american support will become more critical as those very leaders seek assurances they have protection . 
  everyone wins from a disintegrated continent , except us . 
  cleave the union into competing chauvinist interests , and divide rivals into spheres of influence . 
  spread disinformation using both state and commercial players to never allow a point of view to make headway , if they do n't support it using their authority . 
  support majoritist autocracies that provide indirect avenues of disinformation and political instability , in return for their own siege-mentality narrative and various political favours . 
  basically turn us into the caucuses , where we 're all at each other 's throats and they are holding the leash . 
  edit : btw , for romania this has already begun . 
  the uk europhobic media has picked up a corrupt millionaire called adamescu and is using him to hurl accusation against the romanian state to excuse his corruption charges and failing businesses , while undermining the anti-corruption agency and `` the government '' , which to them is every party in romania . 
  not really , large corporation are naturally attracted to placing their hqs next to the political center of a region/country . 
  more out of perception and marketing , but also out of a desire to be close to legislators and government employees . 
  the european medicines agency , in london , and the european banking authority , also in london . 
  do n't laugh , they 're working very hard to make sure their vision of us comes true . 
  [ the trump-putin pact regarding the new division of europe . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/cold_war_europe_military_alliances_map_en.png ), 
  the man was being sarcastic . 
  also , '' / s '' at the end of a line denotes sarcasm , since honestly poe 's law has become the norm now . 
  and i will never understand why wales has such a weak devolved government . 
  or why they keep voting labour .

  officials in bucharest say that christmas pigs are killed around the feast of st ignatius , on december 20th . 
  they may be sprinkled with holy water . 
  adults watching the slaughter will traditionally be fasting , and will not eat the festive dishes derived from the pig ( jellied bits of head , pork cabbage rolls with polenta , blood sausages and so on ) until christmas eve . 
  some village schools give pupils the day off for the pig killing , and children are fed singed bits of skin to cheer them up . 
  `` the children will cry for the pig , because it has been their friend for a year , '' admits niculae lazar , a government vet . 
  but backyard pigs lead better lives than industrial farm animals , he adds . 
  [ or , another description from czech republic ] ( http://www.radio.cz/en/section/panorama/pig-slaughtering-feasts-on-their-way-out ) :  a pig-slaughtering feast is precisely what the name suggests -- the slaughter of a pig out in the open by a master butcher , the processing of the meat and intestines in front of those invited and subsequently a boisterous pork feast accompanied by drinking , music and dancing which generally leaves everyone much the worse for wear . 
   ca n't there be a singleissue party the mainstream press is owned by the leaders of the mainstream parties or their associates . 
  they 'll simply ignore your little party . 
  without any media coverage , you 're not going to win . 
  everyone knows that corruption is by far the worst problem in both southern and eastern europe . 
  ( for [ corruption in romania , see this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1qr6u2/can_someone_explain_to_me_why_bulgaria_is/cdfmv2q?context=3 ) ) but what can we do ? 
  * regular democratic process means replacing a corrupt party/alliance with an equally corrupt party . 
  * better and more independent justice might make us feel good when a politician or a dozen , or a hundred get behind bars , but it changes nothing . 
  in romania , we had a prime-minister , a dozen ministers , dozens of mayors , more than a dozen mps convicted of corruption , but the system is continuing as before . 
  if anything , things are getting worse , not better . 
  we need new people , people who are idealistic , who are not driven by money , people unlike all office-holders we have . 
   general lack of a true sentiment of unity across the continent `` so you hate the us ? 
  so hate them , too !, 
  we have so many things in common ! '', 
  there 's another story like that in romania : during the 1930s , nae ionescu , a fascist christian orthodox philosopher was invited to dinner by romanian orthodox patriarch miron cristea . 
  although it was during lent , they were served turkey . 
  ionescu was outraged by this and wrote an angry newspaper article about this . 
  patriarch cristea responded by asking the painter who was painting the patriarchal cathedral in bucharest to put ionescu 's face on a devil . 
  ** democracy ** -- the institution which has the real power should be democratically elected , not appointed by national governments like the european commission . 
  ** financial union ** -- if you have a common currency , in order to work , you need to get a financial union first . 
  otherwise the poor countries will get poorer ( greece ) and the rich will get richer ( germany ) . 
  ** bureaucracy ** -- do n't make the rules for the common market be too complicated , or you 'd need a huge pointless bureaucracy to run it . 
  do n't allow individual countries to write their own exceptions and exceptions to exceptions . 
  ** do it for the people ** -- if the whole process goes like in the eu , then you 'd end up with a set of rules written by the large corporations . 
  i know it might seem obvious , but in the fundamental legislation you should enshrine the rights for the people , not for the big corporations . 
  ** have one voice ** -- the eu almost never has an opinion about anything . 
  there is no single voice of the eu and this is why it does n't matter as an institution in the world affairs . 
  of course , we could have called ourselves dacians ( just like the belgians , spaniards and italians are called after the ancient regions ) , but now it 's a bit too late for that . 
   i find this confusion disparaging ... roma / romanian . 
  the word `` roma/romanies '' predates `` romanian '' in english . 
  ( they first reached england quite a few centuries ago )  to my surprise the word manus means man in the `` romani language '' what is this bullshit ? 
  languages can have more than word to refer to the same concept . 
  for instance , in english , there is both `` man '' and `` human '' . 
  there 's no `` gypsy conspiracy '' to take over the name of the romanians . 
  well , not fully `` socialist '' ( as in eastern europe ) , but a country with many socialist features . 
  for instance , the state is far more present in the economy than in the more `` economically liberal '' countries . 
  the only two european countries which require visas for eu citizens are russia and belarus . 
  the other way around , for visiting the schengen countries , citizens of russia , belarus , ukraine , kosovo and moldova need visas . 
  the uk also requires visas for citizens of bosnia , macedonia , serbia and albania . 
  well , the accordion guy is a self-employed person . 
  socialism should theoretically support ideas such as `` all humans are equal '' . 
  we had probably ~ 50 politicians convicted during the last few years , including a prime minister ( n\u0103stase , two convictions ) , several former ministers ( babiuc , fenechiu , reme\u0219 , mure\u015fan , copos , ridzi , chiuariu , nagy etc. ), 
  and mps and mayors too many to mention them . 
  however , nothing changed on the corruption front : our politicians are just as corrupt as they ever were . 
  public works contracts are always , without exception , still given in exchange for bribes . 
  artisanal brands of olive oil ( of any country ) are definitely better , but the brands from italy , greece or spain you find in regular supermarkets outside their home countries are quite bad . 
  christian ^ * morality : movies about explicit murders and killings full of gore are ok . movies about explicit sex are not ok . ^ ^ * ^ ( not all christians , but certainly the american protestants and eastern orthodoxy . ), 
  however , it seems the movie is quite bad , but from reasons unrelated to the explicit sex scenes . 
   well fuck italian olive oil then unfortunately , olive oil from other countries can be adulterated as well . 
  from my experience , particularly olive oil from greece . 
  moldavia is a region that is now divided between romania , moldova and ukraine . 
  the `` core '' of the region ( including its former capitals and the river that gave its name ) is in romania . 
  ** romania ** : * moldavia : poor , dirty , drink too much , but cheerful , welcoming and emotional * transylvania : calm , slow in thinking and acting , but dilligent and hard-working * oltenia : they have a very good opinion about their intellect ; they find ingenious solutions ( but which always fail ) , particularly in order to avoid work ; they want to be bosses * banat : they think they are `` the best '' romanians in anything they do * bucharest : cosmopolite smartasses , they think that everyone outside of bucharest is a peasant . 
  * hungarians are seen as very proud , but naive . 
  the sums they would get are ridiculously low compared with their total debt . 
  ( which is  2 trillion $ ), 
   why is greece so adverse to finding a solution to the name ? 
  because they 're stubborn nationalists . 
  or catalunya , because independance * will * go through, 
  why people think it 's a good idea of selling monopolies , such as the air traffic controller ? 
  actually , they personalize results based on region as well , so the order might be different for different countries . 
  the czech republic is probably atheist because it was the european country most affected by religious strife . 
  for instance : * the pope organized five crusades against the followers of bohemian religious reformer jan hus ( known as the `` hussite wars '' , 1419-1434 ) * the thirty years ' war ( 1618 -- 1648 ) decreased the population of bohemia and moravia ( which form today 's czech republic ) by more than a third due to famine , warfare and expulsion of protestants . 
  after the * foreign * catholics won and forcefully converted the czechs back to catholicism , the national struggle was interwined with anti-catholicism . 
  as the hussite religion was dead and there was no local `` native '' church ( as it was in transylvania , for instance ) , anti-catholicism led to irreligion . 
  at least in kiev , it 's the people vs. the government . 
  well , they recognize it as a county , not as a country . 
  [ one day , this sign in london ( now only in romanian ) will be bilingual romanian-serbian ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cvfgnov.jpg ) . 
  the sign is warning pickpockets by saying that `` civil-dressed police officers operate in this area '' . 
  so that 's why there 's so much strife in the middle east : not enough bacon !, 
  if we could only convince the arabs and israelis to eat bacon instead of fighting ... 
  they export each part of the pig to the market that is paying the most : which means that the bacon goes to britain , the feet go to china , etc , while the parts that no one wants become sausages . 
  yes , it can pay more , but the politicians do n't care about their salaries or the quality of medical services . 
  they do n't use the romanian healthcare anyway . 
  if they have any health issue , they take the next flight to vienna . 
  this was valid even for our president , who had his surgery in vienna . 
  the politicians however want the money they manage to be funneled towards their pockets . 
  there have been hundreds of people investigated , dozens of politicians sentenced to jail , but that did n't change one thing . 
   no , he did n't say romanians he said roma referring to gypsies let me quote you : `` people in romania and bulgaria are `` living like animals '' and will want to live in a `` civilised country '' like the uk instead , nigel farage said today . '', 
   right again . 
  and nobody will listen because they 'd rather scream racist . 
  and they would n't be wrong . 
  he is racist and takes any opportunity to insult other ethnic groups . 
  for instance , we , romanians are , according to him , `` uncivilized people '' who `` live like animals '' . 
  he also brings stereotypes in discussions about what he calls `` coloured people '' and he thinks that it is impossible for pakistani pupils to `` rise to the top '' . 
  public illumination in rural areas , in some cases road and highway illumination . 
  at least in the case of moldova , it lost half their gdp/capita after the ussr broke . 
  or an even better example , pinochet 's chile , where , despite being very liberal economically , the dictatorship was very tough on dissent . 
  of course , which is what i said , pure statistics do n't show the entire picture . 
  statistics often do n't show the whole picture . 
  in north korea , they do n't eat too much , there 's no fast food , no processed foods , almost no obesity ( except for the obese-in-chief ) and they eat little meat , so theoretically , they eat healthy . 
  what surprised me about the us was how many restaurants actually belonged to huge corporations who own hundreds , sometimes thousands of them . 
  i went to a diner which , due to the american pop culture , seemed familiar . 
  but a few blocks away , there was another diner , which seemed even more familiar : it was the same brand , the same interior decoration style , everything the same .

you suppose but you 're wrong . 
  and i clearly disagree with your first line . 
  why would anyone send money for weapons instead of sending money for the children living in poverty ? 
  or anyone living in poverty ? 
  or sick people who ca n't take care of themselves ? 
  or for ongs who do good things in a country ? 
  if you have to choose someone to fight against , russia would be at the bottom of the list . 
  because they 're an enormous country with incredible potential , because they can hold their own weight , and because of their spirit , they will fight this in a very bloody way . 
  against . 
  they now have russian citizenship so it no longer matters . 
  de facto means who can exercise control over it , and here is nothing left to dispute . 
  you 're refering to legal affairs which is a different thing . 
  i do n't think you understand what de facto means . 
  you have to be joking ... 
  the geopolitical war started with maidan . 
  to be honest , the term terrorist/m has and is used in absolutely anything you want to make look bad . 
  i think the term lost quite a lot of its initial value , so it may be possible that they view terrorism the way ukrainians view separatism and call it russian backed terrorism . 
  unless your currency has a great parity with the euro , it 's pretty much all disadvantages on entering the eurozone . 
  looks like any uberly corrupt oligarch is a freedom hero if he goes against russia 's current leadership , without any regards to how hated this guy is in russia ( how did you think he got rich ? 
  by being innocent ? 
  well said . 
  not 100 % but most young people are thinking of leaving romania and going for a better place . 
  do we want to find out how the russians would respond if nato starts building bases in ukraine ? 
  not even their territory . 
   no we did n't create it . 
  yes , it was created from the outside . 
  there were lots dissatisfied with assad , but the real rebellion was propped by foreign powers . 
  from insatisfaction to rebellion is quite a long way . 
  to be honest , we 're not exactly sure what happened in ' 89 , most circulated theories point it as a russian backed coup d'etat done by the second echelon of communist party members . 
  the insatisfaction felt by the most people towards the regime was legit . 
   assad like hussein is also a baathist tyrant and the chaos there happened without us intervention while not getting directly involved , the us ( and many other foreign countries ) did create this rebellion that wreaked havoc in syria . 
  growth as a country and growth per capita are two different things . 
  what this image shows us is the gdp per capita , related to growth per capita . 
  both india and china have the same problem , while they have tremendous growth rates , their per capita growth is small . 
  it 's exactly what / u/idle _ villager said . 
  can buy anything in the world regardless of sanctions , unless the sanctions are globally enforced ( all countries in the world , or at least all big ones ) . 
  if poland exports milk at the same price , and it passes through belarus which processes it and adds their own profit margin , it 's going to be more expensive than it was before . 
  i do n't have any information on that . 
  if that 's the case maybe this should get more attention to it and transform it into a an efficient one . 
  ok fine , neither poland or romania can into space any more . 
  we not of stronk :( . 
  it 's probably not that russia are circumventing them , but belarus is feeling like a businessman . 
  because russia can not have a manager but a leader . 
  a manager would not be powerful enough to hold everything together , it 's a huge country with a shitload of interests meeting head to head , and it 's institutions are far from being powerful enough to stand on their own . 
  maybe this will work in a decade or two , but right now , russia simply can not afford to not have a very authoritarian leader . 
  though they did n't ban just polish milk , they banned a lot of agricultural products from the entire eu . 
  it 's quite hard to outcompete the russian domestic dairy factories since the price will obviously be bigger . 
  it may only compensate for a market share if the russian internal production is not sufficient . 
  though , we do n't know what price poland will be selling it , maybe they 'll do discounts and sell them cheaper to belarus , because that would be smart and make the final products still competitive on the russian markets . 
  everyone wins . . oddly . 
  there has been a romanian in space , has any pole been in space ? 
  the message of 9/11 was pretty clear too , withdraw american troops from middle east . 
  desperate freedom fighters or terrorists ? 
  one man 's freedom fighter is another man 's terrorist it seems . 
  they did , after russia somehow banned import food from norway too , some should 've told them they 're not in eu . 
  their reports are very good and impartial about stuff not involving russia . 
  so basically russia ca n't live without polish apples and will get them from belarus , while looking tough and menacing , hiding the apple from their hand : `` what , me eating polish apple ? 
  no , i 'm eating borsch . . i do n't care why it looks like an apple , it 's not !, 
  oh , he was very . 
  which makes / u/politus 's point stronger . 
  yes , bulgaria would love to be included in anything and feel like they are bigger/powerful than they actually are . 
  hell , we 'd love to be there too :( . 
  russia needs to deal with the huge levels of alcohol abuse first ( i 'm not saying it 's easy or that i have any solution ) in order to deal with the homicide level , since they probably are profoundly connected . 
  everything is fascism or terrorism nowadays . 
  i do n't like you , you fascist terrorist . 
  it seems that too few key political actors got the message . 
  psd which is romania 's so called center-left party , has so little left in them that it 's an insult calling them leftists . 
  that 's pretty weird , maybe this deal was politically forced by both sides in the end ? 
  i ca n't imagine negotiation until 4 am and reaching the deal at that hour . 
  woah , where did you get that gif from ? 
  i nominate it no1 gif of the year !, 
  lucky for them , there 's no such situation between russia and china as was crimea 's case - which was a very complex situation . 
  what kind of a failed argument attempt is that ? 
  you want to argue that the west was not involved in the maidan movement and the ousting of yanukovich ? 
   people might get sick of russia lording over their nation and calling all the shots . 
  why do you assume russia was calling ukraine 's shots ? 
  those in western ukraine never liked russia anyway , but those in the east did and still do . 
  by the same logic the us should be split by european nations ... 
  there are different situations , russia and ukraine were one country for a long time , it 's not russian emigrants . 
  russia 's quite stable and predictable , unlike ukraine or belarus . 
  even turkey seems quite stable , but there 's quite some tensions . 
   i would n't be surprised if putin got overthrown at some point . 
  i doubt the west have enough power to start something there , but you can never know . 
   does that mean china can come in and grab a piece or two from russia ? 
  are there any parts that have a weird history between china and russia ? 
  parts with a majority of chinese ethnics ? 
  we did n't expect a violent overthrow of a democratically elected president either . 
   no , there are not . 
  what the hell , where do you get your info from ? 
  yes they are , where do ** you ** get your info from ? 
  / r/europe ? 
   it 's their right ; hungary will have to deal with it ; this is not the 19th century anymore . 
  if hungary does indeed wish for the hungarian minority to preserve their identity then it should do its best to aid ukraine into getting closer to eu . 
  that makes no sense . 
  their interest is either to break that part and take it home , or gain more leverage in ukraine . 
  that while at the same time , getting their votes . 
   these are the allies who have been , for 22 years already , trying to attract ukraine into eu . 
  how can you assume that they are going to be the ones to split the country even more . 
  this is beyond ignorant , honestly . 
  they probably figured by now that bringing ukraine into eu is not an easy task , the country is too divided and has too many problems .

  for instance , uk 's gdp is highly correlated to the [ euro-zone ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;q=united+kingdom+gdp ) . 
  i ca n't even think of an instance where ireland is projecting power , whereas uk is a global player . 
  which translates to business . 
   this is true . 
  britain had a wage reduction , but kept high levels of employment . 
  portual , italy , greece and spain did not have a wage reduction , but have had massive and tragic unemployment and austerity forced on them by either the troika or their own governments to a degree far more severe than anything in the uk . 
  even france has significantly higher unemployment than britain . 
  the ability for the uk 's currency to float freely is exactly what britain needs . 
  romania lowered the wages of state employees by 25 % and pensions by 15 % in 2010 . 
  a free floating currency was not enough , we still had to loan 13 billions euro from the imf in order to maintain the confidence of debt investors . 
  this measure was , as you expect , very unpopular , and as a result the ruling party dropped to 16 % support . 
  without imf measures i do n't think the economy would have reformed . 
  i 'd say that reforms can be passed regardless if it 's a free floating currency or not . 
  more so in a stable currency because there 's never the risk . 
  uk got violently hit by the crisis in 2007 and was forced to bail-out and lower the wages of everyone . 
  whereas france was never in a doom state and thus never needed to reform . 
  i 'd still say that unemployment is related more to the educational system and not to being part of the euro-zone . 
   of course , germany does very well in the euro . 
  but other countries have done very badly in it . 
  one size does not seem to work in the same way for every country . 
  how is this observation not populist ? 
  there are advantages and disadvantages to a single currency union . 
  one advantage that would be that there is no more unfair competition between member states . 
  another that it 's bound to be stable ( ecb mandate ) . 
  another that trade does not take into account currency rate risk . 
  anyway , we 'll see what happens . 
  by 2020 most of the states in the eu will have the euro . 
  there is strength in unity , uk is on par with germany or france in terms of power and competition . 
  do n't kid yourself with comparisons to ireland . 
  the comparison to ireland is extremely poor . 
  uk has a population of 65 million people , whereas ireland has 4.5 million . 
  and then ireland 's bailout was 150 billion euros , whereas uk 's was more than 650 billion . 
  the pound depreciated from a stable 1.4 parity with the euro in 2007 to 1.1-1 .2 in the last five years . 
  what this means is that all british people had a wage reduction of 15 % compared to people in the euro-zone . 
  there 's a very good economic argument that the people in britain would have been a lot better had they switched to the euro . 
  if you want a proper comparison you need to compare it with a country that has a similar population like italy or france . 
  italy bailed out only one bank , with 20 billion euros while france did not bailout anything . 
  italy , france , germany will get their bailout money back with a very good return profit . 
   yes , it is a waste of resources that could be used for better quality of life for the people . 
  in the words of president dwight d. eisenhower : i agree the resources could be used for a better quality of life . 
  but people view security as part of a better quality of life . 
  which is why eisenhower deplored the situation `` under the cloud of threatening war '' , when you 're obliged to divert resources to security . 
  security is on the table yet again in europe , with russia 's surprise annexation of crimea . 
  if you have a belligerent russia that increases defense spending each year and just annexed part of a foreign country , then security becomes a vital component of the quality of life , from the state 's point of view . 
   which explains why sweden ( with its lousy 1.2 % of gdp military spending and being part of no military pact ) is so poor : nobody invests there . 
  sweden had mandatory conscription until 2010 and military spending dropped below 2 % in 2001 . 
  russia has 4.4 % of gdp military spending and keeps increasing it . 
  the russian threat was dismissed until now . 
  one assumption is that putin wants to rewrite how the cold war ended because it was disastrous in terms of russia influence . 
  is europe still stable and secure ? 
   on the other hand , on the nasa project the us spent a hundredth the sums spent on the military and it provided even more returns in technology . 
  america 's military supremacy allowed them to claim world hegemony for 25 + years . 
  it 's the highest return there is . 
  nasa 's moon landing was part of the confrontation with the soviet union , so you can still argue it 's military/security spending . 
  that 's not even an economic theory , just a parable , and one from 1850 , so it 's a bit of a strech to say that economists call this the broken window falacy . 
  the chinese are doing both , they increased military spending and increased infrastructure spending , which is really what the americans are doing , too . 
  only that in china there 's a bubble , they built entire towns that are somewhat deserted . 
  the military industry is not a waste of resources . 
  think about it in this way , a powerful army translates to stability for investors . 
  in a conflict most of them would move their investments to the country with the most powerful army . 
  furthermore , arpanet was a us department of defense project , and it lead to the internet . 
  military research has a high and longterm return . 
  there are ~ 1500 russian troops stationed in transnistria . 
  they became a separatist region with the help of russian troops . 
  very similar situation to crimea that stopped short of annexation . 
  but putin seems to be in an annexation mood lately . 
  it 's an adequate comparison from a historian point of view because of the way crimea was annexed . 
  even though you say that it 's how a conqueror would annex a territory , you ca n't really go beyond 1800 , when the idea of the nation state came to be . 
  even beyond ww1 it 's a bit of a stretch , because we were talking about empires and not our modern nation states . 
  either way , there are too many similarities between hitler 's annexations and the annexation of crimea . 
  simply pointing them out should not get you fired . 
  did you read the article ? 
  the annexation of crimea bears a very strong resemblance to hitler 's actions of 1938 . 
  and every historian could tell you that . 
  only in russia you get fired if you mention it . 
   in an article for the opinion page of the moscow daily vedomosti , zubov pointed out the similarities between putin 's actions in 2014 and hitler 's in 1938 . 
  both leaders justified their land grabs by the need to defend `` suffering '' compatriots . 
  both held questionable plebiscites in occupied areas to legitimize the annexations . 
  in 1938 , `` hitler 's glory was at its zenith , '' zubov wrote . 
  `` the world trembled in the face of great germany . 
  was n't the fuhrer a political genius , attaching areas and whole countries to the reich without a single shot ? '', 
  the price of grain in the commodity futures market did rise and it was not because ukraine installed a new minister . 
  it was as a consequence of the russian invasion of crimea . 
  it 's just speculation on weather russia will invade south-eastern ukraine and seize the black sea ports . 
   an interruption in the export of grain from the region of the black sea would most assuredly spike the worldwide value of grain . 
  investors and analysts alike are speculating on the upward swing in the cost of wheat . 
  the threshold is now . 
   after a russian invasion of this rather defenceless country , investors can expect to see an escalation in wheat prices in the commodity futures market . 
  it is this expectation that is driving the rise in the volume of grain options trading . 
  from [ here ] ( http://www.investing.com/analysis/will-conflict-in-crimea-impact-price-of-grain-205045 ), 
  they control the eastern-european food production ? 
  source for the claim ? 
  putin just altered the constitution . 
  pray he does n't alter it further . 
  at this point i expect russia to present a letter from yanukovych that calls a referendum on crimea . 
  who asked for money ? 
  all i see in the article is  the package combined could bring an overall support of at least 11 billion euros ( $ 15 billion ) over the next couple of years , from the eu budget and eu based international financial institutions , '' the head of the eu executive told a news conference . 
  it most certainly would not want more money . 
  the budget is fixed a priori for the next seven years . 
  in 2013 the council decided on the budget for 2014-2020 .

  it 's important because you can be poor and happy , the experience changes very little whether you are a poor student or a senator the chevice is the same , even if the prices or the place is different . 
  that is what a fundamentally just and equal society is all about . 
  it 's not about having the same problems or lack of , but about having the same joys and experiences . 
  no , it originates from a organic allocation of sufficient human resources for a give price of labor . 
  it is a waste of capital to hire more people despite not being absolutely negesary . 
  and while a excess in ( specialised ) labor is mostly pointless a excess in capital at least offers some flexibility and at most sometimes it can mean enough resiliance to survive a systemic shock . 
  no , organically it 's about around 10 % . 
  if unemployment would be 0 nobody could grow because any marginal growth in labor costs would be ridiculous . 
  wages are only proportional to production but most industries do n't scale : a team of engieneers can make either 7 or 700 assembly lines , it 's just a matter of costs and time . 
  you rarely have the need or is it feasible to pay 100 teams of higly skilled engineers to get your 700 within a economic cycle . 
  hypothetically only the interest in the labor cost would end up more expensive than a slow growth based on one team working for 100 cycles . 
  oh there are , but it would make the economy very rigid : see communist planned economies . 
  sunday family lunch . 
  dinner with the neighbours . 
  neighborhood pizza parties . 
  chilling with some croisants and watching the business oriented people sweat . 
  having some port/wine/grapa / brandy at the end of the day while watching the sunset . 
  *** i know this is shit most gen x and nobody in gen y does anymore , but these are all activities that gave life cheap satisfaction at what is basically minimal costs . 
  young people just work and spend money to reward themselves for working . 
  it 's a very protestant approach , a continuous race on what is basically a treadmill . 
  i can make a case for 10 % unemployment being better than your average 6 % . 
  cheaper employment for small businesses . 
  for me to , i want justice to be determined by laws not the feelz of the mob . 
  having close nit communities and family values ( well at least they are better than the the northerners ), 
  that is the issue with social justice  it 's either our way or you 're wrong, 
  yeah , our women politicians suck balls -, 
  there are a lot of welshmen around ? 
  jk , they do n't have internet , probably other people from third world countries . 
  compared to almost any developed country the brithish economy is disproportionally centralised . 
  i doubt the uk could even have a budged without london . 
  scotland is lucky that it only has 5 milion mouths to manage . 
  i think the point is : we can handle ourselves , london has been screwing the rest of the country for to long . 
  that makes more sense . 
  most major industries . 
  actually the planet is beyond saving , we are just managing the changes at this point . 
  ( but do n't tell the greens that realism does n't really motivate people into giving a fuck ), 
  damn all this excess value , i want to grow my own potatoes and eat them perpetually . 
  this is not demand , this is production . 
  and when you add the issues of a free and isolated energy market i think the difference between 80s consumption and todays consumption changed proportionally in both england and romania - ( the french or the danes would have a different experience as they had massive national programs of alternative production . ), 
  so non refugees have a harder time than refugees finding employment ? 
  that is very wierd . 
   ) that is so cute, 
   what is however discussed is how to integrate immigrants into swedish society more efficiently , but is this discused , without a liberal bias , i ca n't imagine scholars that look into the negative social outcome are well regarded  unexpectedly you need to at least speak swedish to get most jobs . 
  even temp jobs ? 
  i get the reasoning for permanent employment but give them a chance . 
   criminality is n't a main thing either i think that graph is quite worrysome , most western countries ( with less wellfare experienced a significant drop in criminality in the last 20 years )  murders and riots which obviously is n't totally untrue either since with more poor people you undeniably get more crimes in those areas . 
  i 'm not afraid of of non-white on white crime . 
  i fear isolationism , i fear avoidance racism . 
  i fear that after years of neglect you can only enter those comuniities with armored trucks and neglect ruined a generation . 
   since that will cause investors and markets to lose faith in swedens ability to continue driving a market based economy , bullshit , investory want one thing , preditibility , they will take a centralised and controled economy over a high growth one everyday of the week . 
  the only reason they go for volatile economies is that on the retail side that excess growt makes for big profits in the short term . 
  having a calm economy means you do n't get the big dogs , but you also have no fear of the big dogs leaving once they sucked you dry . 
  the issue still remains , why ca n't returning nordics get a job , do n't htey want to ? 
  you underestimate 3rd world countries , most cought up with 80s industrialism , wales never left . 
  actually it 's not , the world market is the same , relative demand does n't change all that much . 
  ( goverment policies are the only real factor and most basically have the same policy of subsidising energy ) what is nonsensical is comparing a small flexible demand like denmark with a subsidised mammoth consumer like france, 
  maybe the old generation ( preboomers ) but post tacher most think ot the americans as close allies/partners . 
  it 's just when you get to the young people that see trough the propaganda and grasp how flawed but pervasive of a system american style corporatism is do you get actual hate . 
  it 's not as much for america but for what it represents and how hypocritically they claim to defend democracy despite being just a corporate powered imperialist machine . 
  i saw one for romania around here , either in a moldovan gas thread or one about cernavoda . 
  we have a similar distribution , just that nuclear and hydro is more important ( smaller overall cunsumtion ), 
  demand increased drasticly durring the 60s to 80s , new tech could not grow as much so oil picked up the slack . 
  in the 90s coal went somewhat out of fashion as nuclear became the cool kid , however demand continued to increase . 
  hydro and nuclear have limited potential , there is a organinc barrier preventing them from fluctuating coal is very stable , no shocks only a slow ( very slow ) tendency to fade away . 
  oil demand is also stable after the 80s , so aparently someone did something right geopolitically . 
  gas is wierd , very erratic . 
  both oil and gas are phased out of use by a artificial pressure , nwe renewable is on steroids but ca n't really grow to fast to keep up the demand ( it seems to have the same systemic rigidity that nuclear and hydro have . 
  ) , so coal is almost disturbed from it 's slow slumber of death to compensate for the slack ,, 
  is there any mature party that is having a dialog on this issue ? 
   fewer than one in five refugees have found a job . 
  after seven years the number rises to about 50 percent , compared with 85 percent for ethnic swedes . 
  fuck housing , you can build houses , if they ca n't get employed that just means that you increase the rate at which criminality not only becomes a option , it becomes the only possible outcome . 
   `` i do n't think that our european union membership precludes us from building an illiberal new state based on national foundations , '' is the jury still out on that ? 
  because if it is , we can solve the ukrainian crisis by just making russia a member . 
  well to be fair : democracy and freedom is just a pretext for : paid political activists who are trying to help foreign interests . 
  see in a autoriatrian state , democracy and freedom are not good things . 
  he just got reelected , the people love this shit . 
  oh the cries from a fallen empire are so sweet . 
  maybe if london would not have concentrated and kept all modern economic development they would n't succeed . 
  germany is a economic power house that literally received an underprivileged second country just 20 years ago . 
  they made efforts for all germans to have a certain standard of living . 
  i do n't think london even cares just how much of a third world country wales is ( no offence , but you know it 's true ), 
  that is the thing , policies need general management , not just a distant agency that `` tells '' people what to do . 
  why ? 
  not being charged should n't it be more stable ? 
  this is an amazing description of romanians . 
  ( except for the german part that is just weird and we use a charcoal grill instead of a cauldron ) what do you mean by complicated slang ? 
  all people should have that right . 
  good luck !, 
  < assuming the right of self determination precedes the right of the rulling class to comand  government is not created to give liberty , but to manage it . 
  ok , i 'm not an idiot , but is this a particle accelerator or an actual production facility for neutrons ( for some reason i do n't understand ), 
  is it just me or would romania become the fourth largest country by area after this ? 
  we can not predict success but all things being equal , it is retarded to concentrate activity around the same mega cities because < arbitrary less than honest reasons , 
  sorry , but that means shit . 
  you need relative growth . 
  it 's not mcdonalts , it 's prepackaged industrial food . 
  it 's high content of fructose portioned sparingly over the day . 
  japan , sweden , most mediterenean ( but ther gen y is quite americanised ) and i think france , the netherlands and south koreea, 
  it 's a consequence of becoming a americanised first world country most `` first world '' countries that have a food culture flexible enough to complement capitalism do n't have this issue . 
  but when you go from communist porridge to abundant high fat , high sugar options but you get your time available for eating cut you do n't really have a choice .

  on option is , for them to only have access to the market with no banking passports and regulated investments in eu space , but only if they allow freedom of movement like norway , switzerland and iceland . 
  if they do n't allow freedom of movement , they should be like russia is for us now . 
  a country we reluctantly do business with , big , strong , nuclear , and at the same time neutered and powerless because of it 's own imperialist ambitions , nationalist centric views and overwhelmingly under the control of a intelligence community run oligarchy . 
  so far it 's looking like it 's leaning toward the second option , i only hope we wont end up feeling as sorry for the brits as we do the russians being trapped and starved in russia by a arrogant government who diminishes its own people because it just does n't play well with others .

  well ... we have to leave for `` richer '' places , we do n't enjoy the luxuries like living in rent free council houses and having our kids fed by `` food banks '' while we 're out and about spending the weekly child benefit and job seekers money on cans of beer and heroin . 
  it might cost us the company of loved ones , health , happiness and dignity , but some might say , that 's the more honorable way to live life .

  but you need meat , you do n't need to steal shit ... 
   not sure if trolling  well think about it ... you know for a fact that not eating animal protein significantly increases the chance of having severe health problems , yet for whatever reason you still deny yourself meat , because , what ? 
  the poor little animals are just too cute to eat ? 
  that 's about figuring out if veganism or vegetarianism cause mental problems , not if they in and of themselves are mental problems . 
  * and in short , yes they do something to brain chemistry among other things and promote a susceptibility for the onset of clinical depression, 
  here :  compulsive behavior and/or mental preoccupation regarding affirmative and ** restrictive dietary practices ** believed by the individual to promote optimum health . 
  and here :  dietary restrictions escalate over time , and may come to include ** elimination of entire food groups ** edit : are you implying there are two flavors of vegetarians , one who morally objects eating meat and another who thinks it 's the healthier nutritional choice ? 
  does n't denying yourself meat because of emotional inadequacies in dealing with how meat is obtained , sound like something that might have a psychological contingent to it ? 
  it lists the recently ( 2016 ) published diagnostics criteria !, 
  you do n't have medical journals publishing diagnostics criteria for something unless the medical community is decidedly focusing on it as an actual issue . 
  the dsm is like the fda , it takes time to chisel something like this into stone . 
  but although there are some exceptions and hold offs a clear definition of orthorexia is currently being shaped , with a stated diagnostic criteria having only recently been submitted . 
   in 2016 , formal criteria for orthorexia were proposed in the peer-reviewed journal eating behaviors by authors thom dunn , phd of the university of northern colorado , and steven bratman . 
  [ 11 ] these criteria are as follows :  criterion a. 
  obsessive focus on `` healthy '' eating , as defined by a dietary theory or set of beliefs whose specific details may vary ; marked by exaggerated emotional distress in relationship to food choices perceived as unhealthy ; weight loss may ensue , but this is conceptualized as an aspect of ideal health rather than as the primary goal . 
  as evidenced by the following : compulsive behavior and/or mental preoccupation regarding affirmative and restrictive dietary practices believed by the individual to promote optimum health . 
  ( footnotes to this criteria add : dietary practices may include use of concentrated `` food supplements . '', 
  exercise performance and/or fit body image may be regarded as an aspect or indicator of health . ), 
  violation of self-imposed dietary rules causes exaggerated fear of disease , sense of personal impurity and/or negative physical sensations , accompanied by anxiety and shame . 
  dietary restrictions escalate over time , and may come to include elimination of entire food groups and involve progressively more frequent and/or severe `` cleanses '' ( partial fasts ) regarded as purifying or detoxifying . 
  this escalation commonly leads to weight loss , but the desire to lose weight is absent , hidden or subordinated to ideation about healthy food . 
   criterion b. 
  the compulsive behavior and mental preoccupation becomes clinically impairing by any of the following : malnutrition , severe weight loss or other medical complications from restricted diet intrapersonal distress or impairment of social , academic or vocational functioning secondary to beliefs or behaviors about healthy diet positive body image , self-worth , identity and/or satisfaction excessively dependent on compliance with self-defined `` healthy '' eating behavior . 
   a diagnostic questionnaire has been developed for orthorexia sufferers , similar to questionnaires for other eating disorders , named the orto-15 . 
  [ 14 ] however , the above cited article by dunn and bratman critiques this survey tool as lacking appropriate internal and external validation . 
  the name of the disorder is ** orthorexia ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orthorexia_nervosa https://www.fastcompany.com/3041330/body-week/the-newest-eating-disorder-to-maybe-enter-dsm-orthorexia https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/orthorexia-eating-clean-eating-disorder + @ u/arcamfmj, 
  vegetarianism and veganism have recently been classified by the medical community as ** mental illnesses ** . 
  they are now part of a category known as ** `` nutritional anxiety disorders '' ** alongside conditions such as bulimia and anorexia . 
  even in legal terms , vegetarianism and , veganism are officially considered self harm , or abuse . 
  in many parts of the world , denying animal protein to your child or any other person or even animal in your care , it is now considered abuse , and if proven to have been the underlining cause for degraded health issues such as anemia or complications do to lowered immunity , it can lead to actual jail time . 
  lately i 've noticed that all the music videos on tv , are about some young bimbo smoking or slowly realising smoke from her mouth in a seductive fashion . 
  regulatory limitations have kicked behavioral placement out of movies and tv series , but not music videos . 
  a tabaco company can not grow without another generation of customers , so naturally they focus exclusively to getting young impressionable people to think of smoking in a very artificiality romanticised way . 
  if they pray on kids and we impose a law that makes it illegal to sell to new kids , we would have effectively shut their shit down . 
  wtf is an \u00e2 \u0179 ? 
  rds ( romania data systems ) the ones with the [ gigabit fiber for 10 eur a month ] ( http://www.rcs-rds.ro/internet-digi-net/fiberlink?t=internet-fix&amp;pachet=digi_net_fiberlink_1000 ) , has already spread in to hungary and i think bulgaria as well but i 'm not sure . 
  even if it costs the eu a ** trillion ** , that averages out to 2.222 eur per person , or about 10 % of average eu gdp per capita . 
  but on a less ridiculous note ... an impact of say 10 billion , ( which is what the uk contributed ) comes to a whopping ** 0.06 eur per day ** per eu citizen ... 
  so they need to calm their tits , we 'll be alight . 
  i was more pointing to the phrasing of that title . 
  `` eu rules promise 100mbps broadband for all '' not `` at least '' , or `` a minimum of '' 100mbps . 
  so they 're gon na cut ours down to a tenth ? 
  i 've seen them interviewed on many occasions , and although second generation brits the still had a thicker accent than apu from the simpsons . 
  many openly admitting to having voted out , so they could bring over more family members from the subcontinent . 
  publicly from official dignitaries and tough media channels . 
  pissing on each others leg at world wide urinal , is hardly the same thing . 
   indian and ukip adviser is that like a nazi rabin ? 
  all i know is , we never point at them , ever , and they 're exclusively preoccupied with trying to pull our pants down in public every month or so , since 1990 .

  read my comments on that thread again . 
  i agreed with you on that . 
  i just did n't like the way you portrayed my country . 
  it would have been much better for romania and bulgaria to join in 2013 alongside croatia . 
  that way the crisis would n't have hit us as hard as it did and we would be more prepared upon joining . 
  this is generally not a popular idea and it might not even be true that romania would have been better off by joining later , but that 's the way i see things . 
  ~ ~ according to [ eurostat ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitviewtableaction.do?dvsc=8 ) , romanians have , on average , the biggest households in the eu ( did not expect that ) . 
  the smallest houses seem to be in denmark . ~ ~ other than that , the `` average '' romanian lives in communist apartment blocks . 
  it 's sad indeed . 
  in theory , yes . 
  the problem is that wages do n't seem to go up very fast and we are already very short on doctors . 
  and even if they go up , i do n't think they will ever reach western wages . 
  let 's say a ukrainian doctor has the chance to migrate to europe . 
  he will certainly not stop in romania just because he would make 2-300 euros more here than in his home country . 
  he would go to ireland or to sweden or any other western eu country because he would make 5 times more there , not just a 300 euros raise . 
  there used to be lots of moldovan doctors coming here , but even they stopped coming . 
  they would much rather go some place else where instead of making 350 euros per month in moldova or 700 in romania , they make 4 or 5000 . 
  do you think that priests would stoop so low for a couple of thousands of euros more per month ? 
  pleaaase !, 
  they are too busy driving their limos and telling old people to donate to the church in the name of god . 
  the problem is that these countries are facing doctor shortages . 
  romania especially . 
  even though we produce loads , we simply do n't have enough doctors as they are leaving constantly . 
  yeah , sure . 
  mate , you live on the other side of the planet , so of course you think it 's no big deal . 
  i 'm not talking about war here . 
  that 's very unlikely to ever happen . 
  i 'm talking about the influence and leverage that russia will gain . 
  my country suffered 40 years of communism . 
  believe me , russia is not a victim of nato 's bullying like it 's been said lately . 
   yes and that 's because you are ** under the impression ** that romania is basically somalia . 
  no , you did not say it , but you seem to believe that the difference between western eu and romania is as big as the difference between liechtenstein and war-thorn syria . 
  yes , we have lots of problems and i understand your stance . 
  when the only people from romania you met are gypsies that beg at every street corner in your home town where before there were none , you get a bit angry and that 's understandable . 
  however , you should n't think that that 's all there is to romania . 
  i urge you to come and visit sometimes and maybe you will change your perspective . 
  yes and that 's because you are under the impression that romania is basically somalia . 
  i was referring to the number of homeless people in romania compared to the rest of europe . 
  yes , romania does have a low gdp for an eu country , but gdp is n't everything . 
  let me give you an example - the us has a gdp of 50.000 $ , yet they have the highest number of homeless people in the western hemisphere , a huge drug problem and their crime rate is trough the roof . 
  your premise is that romania is shit because it 's poorer than western europe . 
  romania might be poorer than western europe , but it 's not a fucking shithole . 
  i suggest you come and visit and you might even like it . 
  it 's not at all like it 's portrayed in the daily mail when they go and report from the shittiest gypsy village they can find . 
  it 's still a european country which is safer than most countries in the world ( even safer than some other , much richer , eu countries ) and also quite a comfortable place in which you can live a happy life . 
  fact base numbers ? 
  i think i already proved you wrong on those . 
  open conflict between such huge powers in this point in time would result in total devastation . 
  so i doubt it 's going to happen . 
  however , china and russia can exert much more influence together and that can be dangerous for the west . 
   ( total trade ) i was n't necessarily talking about the gas deal . 
  i was talking about all their deals which will lead towards friendship and common interest between them . 
  ( space program included ), 
   the two neighbours aim to double the volume to $ 200bn in 10 years . 
  ( total trade ) if it happens , these two countries will have an incentive to get over their quarrels , which can result in a very dangerous alliance . 
  dangerous for europe , in any case , as russia will gain a very strong supporter . 
  that just goes to show how uninformed he is . 
   compared to western europe or the nordics romania and hungary are many years behind in development and that is nothing we can deny . 
  have you read my comment ? 
  i did not deny anything . 
  i said i agreed with you that romania joined eu too soon . 
  i only argued that drugs and homelessness exist , but they are not major issues in romania as you said . 
  not bigger than in the rest of europe , at any rate . 
  this video portrays an extreme situation . 
  you assume that this kind of things are common here . 
  well , you are mistaken . 
  i , personally , never knew about those people living in the sewers . 
  i 'm not trying to be a hypocrite here . 
  sure , there are homeless people living in extreme poverty here , but they are fewer than you would expect . 
  there are 3 million homeless people in europe and only 15 000 in romania . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.homelessworldcup.org/content/homelessness-statistics ) ( europe is right at the beginning of the article ) and [ source ] ( https://www.google.ro/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0cemqfjad&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.feantsa.org%2fspip.php%3faction%3dacceder_document%26arg%3d1523%26cle%3d99c9294184ee3337e4e78417bf999fc6cfd39624%26file%3dpdf%252fromania.pdf&amp;ei=pfd7u86nfofb7abmxigiaq&amp;usg=afqjcnehb9fizacj2ytledyxc6qnzsdm4a&amp;sig2=fz9rm9e7myzpfktbfwuzdq&amp;bvm=bv.67229260,d.zgu ) . 
  you also mentioned drugs . 
  romania is one of the most drug-free countries in the world . 
  at any rate , i agree with you that romania was n't ready to join the eu when it did , but for entirely different reasons that the ones you mentioned . 
  educate yourself before commenting . 
  well , they very rarely came up in political debates over here . 
  maybe never , actually . 
  i bet most romanians have n't even heard of them . 
  however , nigel farage 's recent comment about being concerned if a group of romanians moved near him spiked some controversy and people were not amused . 
  of course , i bet he was talking about gypsies , not romanians , but political correctness got him in trouble this time . 
  can we get this kid banned ? 
  nope . 
  you are totally wrong . 
  doing something stupid is n't the same thing as being ballsy . 
  i understand your stance , i really do . 
  as you might know , there are lots of romanians in ukraine as well . 
  however , do n't you think it 's a little bit hypocritical to demand autonomy on ethnic grounds in these times ? 
  i mean , we 're imposing sanctions on russia for inciting rebels that want independence . 
  yes , the 're a big difference between autonomy and independence , but still , this is not the right time . 
   then check whether you can actually do things with it yourself , you might notice that it 's locked down to an insane degree and configured via tr096 . 
  nope , it 's not locked down , so i guess that 's a good thing . 
   no , i 'm not using my isp-provided router  i 'm not either . 
  i rented my router from a tech store ( i 'm friends with the guy who owns the shop ) . 
  that 's the problem . 
  there is no technology to safely extract shale gas . 
  extracting shale gas is never safe . 
  it 's even more dangerous when people leave very close to the extraction zone as the water will most likely be contaminated . 
  yes , it could be very beneficial . 
  however , there are some big risks when extracting it . 
  do you speak romanian ?
