  according to navalny 's twitter , at least the first 40 pages of the verdict are the carbon copy from the first verdict ( including the typos ) which was quashed by echr . 
  for nizhny novgorod , it 's not . 
  a one-way bus ticket is 20 rub ( ~ 31 cents ) , while a monthly pass is 950 rub ( $ 15 ) . 
  if you only travel to work without transfers 22-23 days a month , it 's already slightly cheaper to not have a pass . 
  then , the bus service is horrendous . 
  wait times are often far too long , so most of the times you 'll take a [ marshrutka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshrutka ) instead ; it is a privately owned small bus ( like [ this one ] ( http://fotobus.msk.ru/photo/06/69/75/669759.jpg ) ) , for which the bus pass is not eligible . 
  11400 rub or $ 180 for nizhny novgorod . 
  almost two times more expensive for moscow . 
  what is there to say ... 
  things have become expensive , but it 's still bearable . 
  i 've finally got used to dollar being 60 instead of 35 . 
  i guess this apathy is largely supported by the feeling that the new ones would be just as corrupt as the current ones . 
  russians are already used to being broke . 
  it would be really hard to exceed the level of poverty of 90s . 
  it would be more interesting to have the number right before the annexation . 
  however , 20 should be a solid lower limit . 
   for putin personally that 's a very important detail . 
  `` tsar is good , boyars are bad '' is a long-established idea . 
  the support for government is always significantly lower than for putin . 
   to study their children in ukrainian schools i ca n't find more recent data , but [ in 2009 ] ( http://news.liga.net/news/society/481441-v-krymu-menshe-vsego-ukrainskikh-shkol.htm ) a stunning amount of 7 schools in crimea were ukrainian . 
  our science might be good , but the only reason this memorandum by ras is needed is the overwhelming popularity of homeopathy among the population . 
  doctors prescribe it , it is sold in drug stores , people take it as real medicine . 
  trying to reason with people that it is useless and ca n't work is almost impossible , they continue to believe all kinds of anti-scientific stuff . 
  and i have a fear that this memorandum wo n't change anything . 
  why ca n't a sovereign nation be ruled by a dictatorship ? 
   you have to pay rent , utilities and food , so that 's about 500 $ off your paycheck just there renting a flat is way too expensive , it 's very rare not to own a flat . 
  if you own a flat , 500 $ should be enough for utilities and reasonable food for a family of two . 
  it 's not a negligible amount of money , but it 's nowhere close enough to be considered `` a lot '' . 
  i would consider people , who are n't able to throw away 12 $ on some useless crap they just want , very poor . 
  i wo n't say it 's `` a lot of money '' for st. petersburg . 
  that 's less than one restaurant dinner , or slightly more that an imax cinema ticket . 
  the average wage there is ~ $ 750 . 
  meanwhile i ca n't even travel to moscow without roaming . 
  i 'm envious . 
  and what if they do n't comply ? 
  we have this bullshit in russia , and would really like my government to fuck off and let me decide where i want to store my data * myself * . 
  look like old photos taken on a film camera . 
  even my photos from 90s have similar unnatural colors . 
  are n't modern biometric passports standardized ? 
  i do n't see much difference between my passport and european ones , for example . 
   ukranian russian-languaged textbook i had in my school used to have less then a half page dedicated to both r-m pact and winter war , while having a lengthy description of great patriotic war . 
  yes , that 's typical . 
  it 's usually more than a half page , more like 1 page , but the great patriotic war has way more focus than the events of the wwii before it . 
   edit : criminalisation of r-m pact - i was refering to law about denial of history , and that foggy story about the guy who was jailed for mebtioning brest parade . 
  i may be mistaken , or not fully in context there though . 
  this law is stupid , but does n't prohibit mentioning r-m pact ( maybe yet , the trend in treating our history is worrying ) . 
  this guy was fined ( not jailed ) for reposting a post about bandera that contained a statement `` the ussr together with nazi germany attacked poland , thus starting the wwii '' . 
  the court decided that it was factually incorrect , because the ussr started its invasion two weeks later than germany . 
  not that i agree with the law and the court decision , but that 's the context as i understand it . 
   russians know exactly that ukrainians did n't kill and eat babies , that they were n't fascists , that `` gayrope '' does n't exist . 
  but they either shut up , or chose to play along . 
  i can not disagree more . 
  my family members and many other people i know sincerely believe that ukraine is a fascist state waging a * civil * war against its russian-speaking population , that crimea was saved from war by russia , that mh17 was shot down by ukrainian forces , etc etc. 
  what side would be evil if this was the truth ? 
  i have completely failed to fight these ideas , they wo n't listen to me because i 'm `` fed american propaganda on my internet '' . 
  and they are not evil people . 
  putin intentionally appeals to the emotions of the people , and they support him not because they choose to be bad , but because they want to be righteous in the reality they live . 
   winter war is almost never mentioned , or downplayed , the molotov-ribbentrop pact is almost never mentioned , and in some context mentioning of it is criminalised where do you get that ? 
  i 've never seen a single textbook used in schools not mentioning these two things . 
  they are mentioned rather briefly indeed , but people who studied well should know about these events . 
   almost fantasy picture pushed through the education channels it might be some teachers to blame . 
  mass repressions and the existence of the cult of the personality are taught in schools . 
  i still ca n't comprehend how he can be respected so much by people who learned it . 
   they know exactly what and who they are supporting and still they are supporting him and his politics i 'd argue that the majority of them does n't . 
  having access to information does n't equal actually using it . 
  i 'm talking specifically about euromaidan , not the war with russia . 
  there were plenty of eu flags on euromaidan , just look at the photos . 
  looks like the result of having no sex ed . 
  i agree that it is be better to write `` russian karelian children '' in the headline if ethnicity is important . 
   yeah , problem is krasnodar is not a name of country . 
  countries are no different . 
  `` russian '' can mean both `` ethnic russian '' or `` a citizen of russia '' . 
   let 's try kabarda or chechnya and than now cossacks are kabardians and chechens ? 
  oh , now that does n't work . 
  :( it does n't work with kabarda , because there is no such administrative region in russia . 
  `` kabardino-balkarian '' is the adjective for things from kabardino-balkaria . 
  `` chechen '' as an adjective can be used for all people living in chechnya , not only ethnic chechen . 
  when i read on the news that , for example , `` chechen pupils are going to visit kremlin christmas tree '' , they are talking about pupils studying in chechnya . 
  the vast majority of them will be ethnic chechens , but non necessary all of them . 
   i mean , russians from karelia are not karelians as russians sochi are not circassians . 
  oh goodness ... 
  words can have multiple meanings . 
  `` karelian '' is also used for things from karelia , not only ethnic karelians . 
  maybe it was better to use `` children from karelia '' to prevent this confusion . 
  for children from sochi the similar use would be `` krasnodar children '' . 
  they might be relevant in local politics , but you mentioned them as `` opposition figures '' , which does n't describe them well ( especially varlamov ) . 
  navalny , like him or not , is definitely an opposition figure ; he specifically does things against the current government . 
  though the chance that he becomes influential is probably very low . 
  max katz is a former prominent poker player , a municipal deputy of one of the moscow districts , and a blogger ( # 179 at livejournal ) mostly known for spreading urbanist ideas . 
  together with varlamov they founded `` city projects '' , a fund aimed at improving the city infrastructure by using modern urbanism . 
  at the moment , he is studying public and urban policy at the university of glasgow . 
  he frequently expresses his quite oppositional political views in his blog . 
  his political experience includes : being a municipal deputy in moscow , helping varlamov to run for the mayor of omsk ( unsuccessful ) , helping navalny with his 2013 moscow mayor campaign ( he had a conflict with other staff members and was fired ; he does n't get along well with navalny since then ) , running for a deputy of moscow state duma ( unsuccessful ) , helping dmitry gudkov to run for a deputy of moscow state duma ( unsuccessful ) . 
  as a politician he is completely irrelevant beyond moscow . 
  i really like his blog though . 
  ilya varlamov is a photographer and a very popular blogger ( among the top ones , probably even * the * top ) . 
  his political views are unclear , probably slightly oppositional , but he was putin 's personal blogger in 2010-2011 . 
  overall he seems a reasonable person , but he is not a politician at all . 
  his only political experience was running for a mayor of omsk , but he failed to collect enough signatures to even become a candidate . 
  23 % in one of polling districts where he balloted , not in the whole moscow .

  you can do better than that !, 
  people of smolensk are waiting for their lithuanian overlords . 
  he 's the head of the mod press service department , not just some random guy . 
  god , it 's like they are actively looking for a reason to be outraged . 
  i ca n't understand why would they care about what some satirical magazine writes . 
  if not for those tragic events with ch , they would n't even know it existed . 
  he reposted a vk post , not a facebook one . 
  he 's accused exactly of the content of the reposted messages . 
  vk is more popular than ok . 
   you russians i 'm not a part of a hivemind , you know . 
  i am not zadornov either . 
  if you have any claims against me personally , bring it on . 
  but i wo n't hold responsibility for words and actions of any other person from my country except myself . 
  you do n't have to feel sorry . 
  but you could have shown some decency and kept silent . 
  i guess the name of my city is hard to pronounce and create a reasonable spelling . 
  i 'm surprised to see `` myrmanskoy more '' . 
  i did n't know that the murmansk 's name is that much older than the city . 
  what ? 
  it is relevant exactly how ? 
  google failed to translate `` factionless '' ( independent ) . 
  this person also wounded 3 other people . 
  what a `` hero '' indeed . 
  this man is unbelievably fast for a postal official . 
  you overestimate moscow . 
  it 's `` merely '' a 12 million city . 
  most explanations i know fall back to religion . 
  do you have a more sound one ? 
   i live in this country , i do n't need to , thanks . 
  living in a country does n't protect one from being delusional about it . 
   they were n't beaten up because they were lgbt , they were beaten up because they were making aggressive propaganda . 
  oh , that 's so much better !, 
  should i remind you that the right of assembly is guaranteed by georgian constitution ? 
  the fact that marriage and family are important is exactly the reason why homosexual people want a legal way to create a family . 
  i do n't see how it can destroy the institution of family . 
   if you want to have a word for gay `` marriages '' , fair , you can make new word for it and use it to describe your `` marriage '' , no one will object or give a single , flying fuck . 
  then , i assume , georgian society would be completely fine with the registered same sex unions . 
  except it would n't , and i 'm entirely sure of it . 
   navalny has 206k followers on vk  on twitter he has 1.72 m  so i think these numbers suggest that his audience is mostly western and his media presence engineered and cultivated with their attention to him . 
  i can not agree with this analysis of the social media . 
  navalny was one of the top bloggers in the russian segment of livejournal , while being somewhat active in twitter and facebook . 
  he did n't even have a vk page back then . 
  after his lj blog was banned , he moved to his own site , but lost a lot of popularity . 
  vk was never his platform . 
  vk is not a dominant platform for following people in russia anyway , even medvedev has 2.5 times more followers on twitter than on vk . 
  vk is more for friends and funny publics . 
   he has not really done much except lose elections , show up at every anti gov protest and make videos of himself promising the world . 
  he leaked some documents that he may have gotten from american intelligence he is more known as a blogger and a founder of rospil and the fund against corruption . 
  some sort of preparation most likely started on february 20 , we have this date on a [ medal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medal_%22for_the_return_of_crimea%22 ) . 
  but soldiers definitely appeared later . 
  however , he acknowledges that the annexation was illegal , which will probably make him lose some support . 
  the problem is , his rule does n't really follow russian laws . 
  i have to correct you : russian forces appeared on february 26/27 . 
  on february 20 yanukovich was still in kiev . 
  however , it does n't change the fact that the referendum happened after the occupation . 
  he is mostly irrelevant now . 
  a lot of people blame him for the dissolution of the soviet union . 
  why not ? 
  i really love my language , i have a lot of respect for russian literature , art , music , science . 
  i really want russia to become a wealthy , developed country with a lot of cultural influence in the world . 
  however , i totally despise russia in its current state . 
  the line of thinking also includes `` saving crimean people from fascists in kiev '' . 
  which is not widely used . 
  i 'm a physicist , and almost all russian papers i read are in computer modern or tnr . 
  liberation serif is licensed under gnu gpl , while astra has a closed version . 
  other fonts are not metric compatible with tnr . 
  many russian documents have to be in tnr according to a standard . 
  i wonder how some major things fall into this concept . 
  take , for example , slavery . 
  the view of christianity ( as well as the humanity in general ) on slavery was very different in different historic periods . 
  passages from the bible can be used to support both kind of views on slavery . 
  on which basis can we decide whether slavery is or is not moral ? 
  how is it possible that people of supposedly the same christian faith ( be it catholic or orthodox ) were completely fine with the slavery several centuries ago , while nowadays most of christians , i presume , condemn it ? 
  were christians somehow misguided back then or are they misguided now ? 
  for some reason you think that only your morality is right . 
   i personally do n't see how one can have any sort of morality without some sort of faith some humans have brains . 
  so it seems you 're also against atheists adopting kids . 
  i 'm speechless . 
  i like the swiss sea . 
  i never said it was the only measurement of progress . 
  is estonia not very progressive in other aspects compared to other ex-ussr countries ? 
  well , other baltic and eastern european countries do n't seem to be very progressive in this regard , so estonia is a nice exception . 
  estonia , the most progressive ex-ussr country . 
  historically , culturally and geographically , yes . 
   a russian on an american website in a european subreddit what 's your point ? 
  is russia not european ? 
  or they would know that '' \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 '' does n't have a capital letter in it . 
  `` fatherland '' ( \u041e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e ) is widely used in russian for russia . 
  not a bright future for me as a physicist . 
  i suspect that a lot of young talented people wanting an academia career might eventually leave russia . 
  god , i hate my passengers !, 
  every time i tell people on the back seat to put seat-belts on , they either ask `` is it required on the back seat ? '', 
  or reply `` oh , yes , there 're police ahead '' . 
  nobody understands that they should do this for safety . 
  sometimes i even have to give them an ultimatum that we are n't going anywhere while the seat-belts are not put on . 
  i think that speed limits contribute a lot to the death toll . 
  you can speed up to 79 km/h in most urban areas without being fined . 
  intercity roads with only a single lane in each direction or no separators also do n't help . 
  `` ever seen '' where ? 
  i think we 've had similar things for quite some time .

  considering that the very first law after ousting yanukovich was against the russian language , native to the majority of crimeans ? 
  yeah , i think it is quite plausible . 
  it is . 
  even in the nineties , you would go way out of your way to take some of those photos . 
  it 's cherrypicking . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atrocities_in_the_congo_free_state and , i repeat , only a minority suffered in gulag , compared to the whole population of the colonies ( well , except for the owners ) . 
   ok , so why do you , russia , and apologists insist on trying to portray it as somehow legitimate ? 
  i do n't . 
  what i do insist on is not rewriting the history , recent or otherwise . 
  it 's not `` legitimate '' , ok , who cares . 
  but it was * not * held `` at the gunpoint '' , the outcome was not forced , it was really what people wanted there ( democracy , yay ! ), 
  and you people who try to create that myth will not get away with it , not easily at least . 
  that 's it . 
   because there was an armed annexation in progress with forces storming government buildings . 
  of course they refused , as they should have . 
  this is not the way `` referendums '' go in the modern civilized world . 
  yes , except when `` the modern civilized world '' approves of storming government building , as happened in kiev . 
  somehow that was perfectly fine , is n't that strange ? 
  living in a colony as a white man , i presume ? 
  because what happened in some colonies for the natives was * way * worse than any siberian labour camp , and of course only a minority were sent there . 
  a very significant minority , but nevertheless most people in the ussr even during stalinism were far , far better off than , say , people of congo during belgian rule . 
  the west , as always , was more competent than russia , even in spreading misery , horror and death . 
   interesting perspective . 
  but secession is illegal in russia , no ? 
  yes , it is hypocritic . 
  this hypocrisy , though , is not relevant to the question of the referendum . 
   come on , they stormed government buildings with armed little green men . 
  we were talking about referendum , though . 
  those men enabled it , but as far as i know , nobody forced crimeans ( a ) to go to the voting booths , * and * ( b ) to vote in a certain way . 
  yes , remaining part of ukraine was the other option . 
  both options were in favour of russia : crimea either returns to russia or obtains enough autonomy so mainland ukraine woul n't be able to give a boot to russian navy there . 
   why the lies , rigged ballot , eh , what ? 
   no observers , etc. ? 
  there were observers . 
  not the kind the eu would want , but osce observers were invited too , they simply refused . 
   the issue is that the way it was done is totally illegitimate again , nobody said a word when totally legitimate referendum was scratched by ukraine . 
  why should we care about legitimacy then ? 
  first , no , not for decades . 
  even if you take the gulag archipelago at face value ( and you should n't , ask any historian ) , stalinism was n't the aftermath of a communist revolution . 
  ussr both before and especially after stalin was n't this oppressive . 
  second , about the most miserable place on earth ... western colonies would like to have a word with you . 
  it is a part of it , and have been for about 20 years . 
  why do you ask ? 
   nobody outside ukraine would complain about crimea if the referendum was n't held at gunpoint . 
  nobody outside ukraine complained when ukraine ignored results of the crimean referendums in the nineties , removed crimean president and scrapped crimean constitution . 
  and no , recent referendum was not held at the gunpoint . 
  try and find any photo or video with the voting booths or people queueing to vote * and * armed men . 
  you wo n't . 
  why not ? 
  that would be even harder to get , though . 
  a throwaway vkontakte account , for which you would need a throwaway sim card , which is kind of hard to get . 
  the quality of life under putin is all-time high . 
  well , was , before all that oil prices and sanctions business . 
  there is exactly nothing ridiculous behind his approval ratings . 
   finns had zero reason to provoke anything previous history of ussr-finland relationships says otherwise . 
   russia had every intention to take over finland to build more buffer for leningrad ussr , not russia . 
  and yes , they did , so they used this incident as a pretext . 
  this does n't say much about the incident itself , though . 
  it 's not like the ussr-finnish border was 100 % peaceful and then bam !, 
  the mainila shelling . 
  actually , i would like this water to be clear . 
  but it 's simply not . 
   these damn ukrainians started to think too much about themselves there is thinking and then there is [ thinking ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofef5l72sjq ) . 
  if `` do n't praise war criminals and do n't call for ethnic cleansing '' is `` knowing their place '' , then i fucking want them to know their place . 
   because finland did n't even participate in the siege [ duude . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naval_detachment_k ) and this is just one example of `` not even participating in the siege '' . 
   neutral nation that had absolutely no hostility towards it your knowledge of history is clearly lacking . 
  regardless of what happened there in mainila , finland in the 30s was anything but `` absolutely no hostile '' . 
  this was proven later when finland took part in starving civilians in leningrad to death . 
  except if you go a little bit deeper than wikipedia , it becomes far less easier to understand what really happened there . 
  the sources are inconclusive on both sides , ussr and finnish alike . 
   the soviet archives were opened in the 1990s and that 's when it was discovered to be a fabrication . 
  could you give a link to that ? 
  the thing is i 'm pretty sure it was n't in the archives , at least not to the point of certainty ( as in `` a secret order to organize the provocation '' or something like that ) . 
  this is not really relevant to the question of citizenship ( see lithuania ) . 
  so what ? 
  being gay was illegal under the laws of great britain , alan turing died because of that . 
  but we 're talking about the ussr here , not gb and not nazi germany . 
  did estonia or latvia released any inmates convicted under the ussr laws ? 
  they did , when estonia and latvia were parts of the ussr . 
   it was n't legal . 
  it was , under the laws of the ussr . 
   what was it that stalin said ? 
  `` women will give birth to more '' [ that 's a myth , actually . 
  ] ( http://www.politonline.ru/provocation/22882876.html ), 
  wait , is n't calling for proofs a sure sign of a kremlin troll ? 
  you 're confusing facts with opinions . 
  reality clearly disagrees with you . 
  balts gon na be balts . 
  it 's not called butthurt belt for nothing . 
  so , increasing percent ( a clear majority in 2015 ) of people who want to see russia in it 's current borders ( and not expanded ) is the proof that `` according to the opinion polls getting more land from other countries is very popular '' . 
  i ca n't even . 
   according to the opinion polls getting more land from other countries is very popular proofs ? 
   the economy has collapsed no , it did n't . 
  the crysis of 2008 was way worse . 
   and he 's brainwashed the population into believing it 's the eu and america 's fault i do n't think you have a slightest idea what you 're talking about . 
  there is one in kharkov . 
  kiev-pechersk lavra is higher in the rankings , though , at least for me . 
  start with returning territories russian occupation gave your country . 
  whataboutism .

  what 's wrong with unequility in the us ? 
  unequility is not a desease itself, 
  almost no one in russia will tell you that he `` supports oligarchs '' . 
  but people do it indirectly , right, 
  fortunately . 
  under the video typical youtube trash discusion lol, 
  sometimes they invite true opposition , but only separately and mock him by all crowd, 
  okay . 
  i forgot that your use the same alphabet as the others and i can just find original name . 
  maybe tomash maceychuk is more correct ? 
  that we lives in a shit . 
  nothing new, 
  google translate : record tv program `` the right to vote '' on the tvc channel on the situation in ukraine , over a scuffle participants . 
  as a result of the conflict , it was decided not to start a program on the air . 
  the incident occurred due to the fact that we are in the studio polish journalist tomasz matseychuk several times grossly insulted russia and the russian people . 
  statements guest in the studio caused the angry reaction of his opponents who demanded to leave tomas shooting . 
  however , the journalist refused and again naham interlocutors , after which the ex-head of the party `` rodina '' igor markov lost his nerve , and he paid a pole punch to the head , after which the recording stops . 
  note that during a clash matseychuk did not try to apologize and claimed that it is entitled to make such statements . 
  some ukrainian guests had left the studio after filming a fight with him in solidarity . 
  as reported at the television because of the incident on the air transfer will not work . 
  okay maybe i just do n't know your language . 
  in russian we do n't use our analog of this word ( \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0438\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0439 ) in that way . 
  \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0438\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0439 = friendly to abstract guests , not to some specific group . 
  i do n't really understand why . 
  in that way you can say that russians are not * every positive feature * , because they dislikes gays . 
  it causes a different reaction = it is different . 
  here it matters  and therefore not hospitable it is not tollerance , but hospitality is different . 
  i dunno , maybe only in russian language , but original post was by finn . 
  i suppose he used the same meaning, 
   holding a hand of a person you ** gay ** love is a provocation ? 
  it is a public expression of ** gay ** love , are you saying that ** gay ** love is not adopted as a value in russia ? 
  now all is correct . 
  it is not adopted , true . 
   simply even for me , although i 'm not homophobic , it is not simply . 
  i can say that i 've never seen gay couples , holding hands . 
  it will , at least , catches my attention . 
  though i i live in spb , in a large city . 
  russians are hospitable means that they 'll do for you all that they can , if you are their guest . 
  that is true ( or was true , now i 'm not sure . 
  compare to the armenians , f.e. , we still are ) . 
  it has absolutely nothing with our values and our reaction on a strange attention, 
  it is public expression of somewhat , that is not adopted here . 
  it is your basic value because you do n't find anything strange in it . 
  we are and everybody knows it , so it is just a provocation . 
   how can you call russia a hospitable place , if holding a hand of someone you love is considered `` disrespecting local values '' ? 
  it is sophistry . 
  hospitality does n't apply to the people who disrespect your . 
  btw i ca n't call it now , but for other reasons . 
  maybe before the collapse of the ussr it was so , but now i 'm doubt, 
  why do you care about it . 
  just laugh, 
  i learned german at school . 
  but now i forgot almost everything : /, 
  hospitality is different . 
  i should n't have added that you must at least respect people , if you are a guest . 
  we 've different culture so system of your basic values do n't work here . 
  especially in rural , the most convervative , places . 
  if you are a gay , just do n't tell it , is it hard ? 
  and except if you are thief , rapist or murderer . 
  if you 'll always add all this descriptions , your speech would be ponderous, 
  yeah i know, 
  rammstein ?

  it are their internal affairs, 
  separatists are criminals whoever they are, 
  lol what ?

  maybe because clinton promised to start the war with us ?

  what does it mean `` pro-russian '' ? 
  i 've never heard about some kind of coalition with bulgaria or moldova . 
  if you just blame him for being corrupted by russia , write in this way, 
  it is typical dutch thing or what, 
  you saw the picture in the internet and are going to go there already ? 
  there was the only reason to post it here, 
  zero tolerance, 
  the motherland can sleep peacefully, 
  they 're good at bascetball ^ / s, 
  propably you are right , but why do you care ? 
  pr-campaign is n't bad itself, 
  do you think they know all these instructions ? 
  they are normal people , not politicians or lawyers, 
  this list is just bad . 
  you do n't need to explain me . 
  but there are still some social groups that support him, 
  right wing dislikes him from the begining . 
  left wing dislikes him because of right-wing politics . 
  am i right ? 
  not absolutely , there are still things like el ` tsin centre,

  nah but you plaster a murdering imperialist on your money instead . 
  the fact that he chose to integrate nazis into society rather than prosecuting them , maybe ? 
   he did it all on his own that was never the insinuation and you know it was n't . 
  it was implemented under his government so it is also fair that he takes responsibility for it . 
  i know , what on earth ? 
  is it because i 'm russian he picked up on it ? 
  just not relevant at all, 
  i know , if he read my post history or asked he 'd realise i 'm vehemently anti stalin . 
  fail to see how that has anything to do with adanauer at all . 
  i studied post-ww2 germany in an english school . 
  what are * you * talking about ? 
  the entire concept of `` year zero '' was that the country attempted to integrate nazis , as they knew it would be difficult to rebuild the country without them . 
  german restitution laws , operation paperclip ... thousands of nazis escaped prosecution . 
  he was the one who implemented the year zero policy and wanted to end de-nazification by 1949 . 
  i think the substantial contrast between the `` glory days '' and the absolute shit we have had the past 20 years makes people idealise it . 
  the facts regarding industrial development , technological innovation and quality of life can not be denied - but it is important to remember that underlining all of this was a vicious ideology that can never ultimately be sustainable . 
  i pray that one day we can have democracy . 
  russian people have suffered so tremendously , you can see where the cliche `` inherent suffering of the russian soul '' thing comes from, 
  i personally really despise the man . 
  a pragmatist and skilled politician , but also a nazi sympathiser who let thousands escape punishment . 
  yeah , lets forget the fact that he murdered my ancestors and stole their property because he was great at building industry !, 
  thanks , that means a lot . 
  i hope so too . 
  it would all depend per person ... for me , the most important russian figures of all time would be dostoevsky , pushkin , tolstoy , mendeleev ... but i think the greatest `` leader '' was peter the first . 
   true russophobia are behind the kremlin walls so true . 
  you are no `` russian patriot '' if you feed russian people false history , imprison them under autocracy and steal their taxes for yourself . 
  these people are often one of two groups : elders who grew up under the authoritarian dictatorship of the soviet union are are too indoctrinated , or dumb kids born after the fall of soviet union who idealise a past they never had to witness . 
  that 's true . 
  they 've never been given information to believe otherwise , it is a tragedy, 
  why hate me over it ? 
  i 'm just a russian 18 year old , i have no capacity to influence what the government does and these events transpired before i was even born . 
  germans sent my ancestors to concentration camps and stole my great grandfather 's factories and never paid reparations , does that mean i 'm justified in hating all germans ? 
  idiots who never read a history book . 
  tragic because most of them statistically have relatives killed by stalin . 
  okay you 're clearly not capable of a diplomatic or coherent conversation . 
  i do n't know what personal experiences you 've had to make you hate russia so much but i hope you manage to get over it, 
  that `` frozen desert '' has potentially trillions of dollars worth of natural resources ... okay , whatever helps you sleep at night, 
  your quotation was clearly not a joke . 
  once confronted with a coherent argument however you want to claim that it was . 
  yet again the russophobic double think comes into play . 
  russia is simultaneously a dictatorship with no liberties , but at the same time a democracy that everybody participates in to vote for putin ? 
  do you even hear yourself ? 
  i know this is a joke but if i as a russian made a joke about splitting poland in half i 'd be hounded and downvoted to oblivion . 
  double standard when it comes to prejudice if it involves , russia , as per usual . 
  its ' really frustrating . 
  i understand your hatred of russian government but why take that out on russian people ? 
  what 's your problem ? 
  hate the russian government but why take it out on innocent russian civilians . 
  russian citizenship means they have a russian passport because they 're born in geographic russia . 
  my comment does n't pertain to ethnicity, 
  they 'd associate the self with that region rather than russia, 
  this is very true . 
  most muslims in russia are part of ethnic groups such as : avar , dagestan , chechen ... ethnic russian muslims are * very * rare . 
  not true , they do n't consider themselves ethnic russians at all . 
  they have legal russian citizenship but they would not consider themselves russian . 
  call a chechen `` russian '' and i do n't even want to imagine what they 'd do . 
  people do n't actually realise how ethnically diverse russia is . 
  moscow has a massive muslim population . 
  it is nowhere near the homogeneous nations of europe that a lot of people characterise it as . 
  venice is such a crazy city . 
  such a tiny cluster of islands , who on earth would think to design it into a clustered city with such awkwardly strained logistics !, 
  fantastic , incredible face that feasibly should n't exist . 
  and that 's what makes it so fantastic . 
  need to visit one day !, 
  because they have no ideology or morals which they abide by - they just want publicity . 
  i remember waking up 4am to see that result , and my heart just sunk . 
  the rest has been utter shit . 
  i genuinely think / r/russia is just putinbots . 
  most the people there do n't even speak russian , and it 's always the most radical ones who are spouting utter rubbish . 
  some of the actual russians there are cool guys . 
  i never said it was better . 
  i think it 's worse . 
  but people need to stop lying - his statement `` uk have recently imported islamic immigrants '' is not true and factually incorrect, 
  do n't know what your problem is but i 'm a british citizen and legally have every right to call myself one . 
  dual citizenship - born in russia but moved here a few years ago . 
  am i not making sense . 
  having 2nd generation extremists = worst than 1st generation because it conveys the failure of cultural integration to be implemented , subsequently creating a demographic of technically `` british '' individuals with british legal rights whilst festering extremist views . 
  what did i say that contradicted that . 
  i thought i was good at english :(, 
  oh , 100 % - it means they 're legally considered british and can not be deported . 
  i just think accuracy is important . 
  because any valid concerns raised and pointing out that the leave campaign do n't have a coherent strategy about anything was branded `` project fear !!!!! '', 
  and the whole ` rule britannia ' rhetoric appealed to nationalists . 
  [ this debate sums it up really ] ( https://youtu.be/lw4c2dy2qv0 ), 
  it 's not about optimism it 's about actually being factually correct . 
  do n't let this idiot affect your perception of all of us, 
  how far we have fallen . 
  communism set us back fifty years , can only dream how amazing russia would be without it . 
  `` chebureki '' is essentially a folded piece of dough with mince in it . 
  you might also be thinking of `` pelmeni '' which are small dumplings you can stuff with meat or cherries . 
  sorry i do n't have russian keyboard on my phone , 
  live in the u.k. too and there 's nothing more condescending than this morons over simplifying years of british demographic growth and culture into `` they 've imported tonnes of immigrants !!! '', 
  um ... no we have n't . 
  most the terrorists are second generation immigrants . 
  except that 's just not true , is it . 
  most of the terrorists are second generation immigrants , refugees from libya in the 1990s . 
  stop chatting out your arse, 
  haha this is hilarious , i like the american puppet . 
  wow , interesting , i did n't know that !, 
  thanks for the knowledge,

  cost of healthcare * for a french citizen in a foreign country * . 
   who where in the same shithole in the 90s that russia was in they were n't . 
  for starters , all the external debt of the ussr fell on russia . 
  he is n't unknown today . 
  does n't mean that he has serious chance at winning presidency . 
  he does n't have any management experience worth mentioning , only crazies would vote for him ( at least i hope ) . 
   candidates with a serious shot like navalny you ca n't be serious . 
   going over the definition of fascism , every aspect matches the modern russia so close that it leaves no room for doubt well , that must be pretty hand-tailored definition of fascism , 'cause definitions i know about do n't match very well at all . 
  of course . 
  some people claim though that there is no relation at all besides the name that `` the duchy of moscovia '' just `` took '' . 
  like [ this ] ( http://euromaidanpress.com/2014/05/14/how-moscow-hijacked-the-history-of-kyivan-rus/ ) . 
  well , i agree that it 's incorrect to call that region `` russia '' ; it 's kievan rus . 
  what i do not agree is this common theme among some people that modern russia or it 's predecessor the duchy of moscovia is n't related to kievan rus . 
   there was a loose association of rus states , with largest center in kiev , but it 's not related to russia really except that rurik dinasty thing . 
  and the language . 
  and the history . 
  totally not related at all . 
  ukrainians were n't special here too . 
  russification policies were the same all across the ussr . 
  again , the ukrainian bias . 
  soviet union was oppressing all kinds of people of all kinds of ethnicities . 
  about 5 million russians died of hunger in the povolzhye famine in the 1920s , does that prove that s.u. 
  was systematically oppressing the russians too ? 
  oh , and just like with holodomor , s.u. 
  did n't `` single out '' ukrainians in the 1946 famine ; people died of hunger in moldova and central russia too . 
  so much for `` systematically oppressing the ukrainians '' . 
  look up `` the years of hunger '' by davies and wheatcroft . 
  it 's the most recent research on the subject , done after russian government opened access to classified soviet archives . 
  aaand we should use this definition of holodomor because ... ? 
  maybe because almost every resource on holodomor does n't even mention what happened in other parts of the ussr , thus focusing all attention on ukraine and introducing a massive bias ? 
  well , i refuse to talk about * ukrainian * holodomor . 
  it 's simply unfair to all other victims of that crime . 
  also , i like how you completely ignored the wrong timeline of yours . 
  what makes you think that i 'm talking about soviet research ? 
  because i do n't . 
  [ you can start here . 
  ] ( http://www.refworld.org/docid/469f38ec2.html ), 
  riiiight . 
  and to hell with all those history research that tell otherwise . 
  it was a crime against humanity , why assign inappropriate names to it ? 
  holodomor did n't happen in ukraine alone . 
  in fact , large regions of russia and khazakhstan were affected just as much , if not more . 
  so no , it is incorrect to say that * ukrainian * farmers were targeted , because they were not . 
  oh , and there 's no need to wave your ignorance around , it looks really bad . 
   kulaks , who were ukrainian independent farmers  the hardest year was 1946 uhm , i do n't think you have a slightest idea what the holodomor was . 
  or who kulaks were , for that matter . 
  hint : it 's 30s , not 40s ; and `` kulak '' was a * russian * word for rich farmer . 
   300  gorillu that feeling when you do n't understand a word , yet do understand the whole text . 
  i was talking about time _ after _ that . 
  there were no revolution that brought changes from yeltsin 's nineties to putin 's zeroes/tens , but the changes are here . 
  first , russia makes decent enough meat , dairy , and other products . 
  second , not all imports are banned , and third , there are countries outside eu . 
  dude , are you sure you read me correctly ? 
  i mean after that , from yeltsin to putin . 
  last time i checked , there was no any revolution during the nineties or the zeroes . 
  yet the changes are immense . 
  some for good , some for bad , but still . 
  [ is it , though ?

  huh , did n't even notice this . 
  til , thanks . 
  over 60 % if you do n't account for the frequency of the words . 
  as far as i know , many everyday english words are germanic . 
  lexical distance has nothing to do with pronunciation , it 's about how similar are words and written texts . 
  this is anecdotal evidence , of course , but i really find bulgarian text somewhat easier to understand than belorussian or ukrainian . 
  i 've used google translate , since real wiki pages are somewhat different ; still , from what i gather , at least the words are more or less correct . 
  all bulgarian words are at least somewhat similar to russian ones , but what '' \u0432\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u045e\u0446\u0430 '' or '' \u0432\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0446\u044f '' could mean ? 
  as far as pronunciation and grammar go , ukrainian and belorussian are of course much closer to russian than bulgarian is . 
  ( disclamer : i do n't really know bulgarian , ukrainian or belorussian ; i only use google translate and some basic logic . ), 
  this is great news . 
  i expect this to be the only comment here . 
  i 'm sorry , but you 're doing it wrong . 
  https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/crime 1 : an illegal act for which someone can be punished by the government ; especially : a gross violation of law domestic violence is still illegal in russia and is still punished by the government . 
  the fact that in english legalese `` crime '' usually means `` criminal crime '' does n't change anything about the basic meaning of the word . 
  it must be hard to be you , so drunk on propaganda . 
  the reality is that it 's still illegal , just the first occurance ( without any harm to health beyond bruises ) falls under the administrative codex and not criminal one . 
  in your wet dreams . 
  wrong . 
  i thiiiink not exactly that . 
  more likely reason is that ussr-made consumer goods were mostly shit , and everyone knew that if you want a good radio/tv/shoes / whatever , you got ta go for anything but ussr-made . 
  at least something east european , better yet west european , us or japanese . 
  many modern russian-made goods are actually much better than they used to be , if not on par with foreign stuff , but people still often consider them as shit . 
   russia imported their own people into a relatively recent land grab say what again ? 
  if you 're talking about imperial times , that was n't a land grab ; russia had had enough of [ tatar slave raids ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean\u2013nogai_raids_into_east_slavic_lands ) . 
  hundreds of thousands of people were lost to these . 
  the whole point of mad is that no country can obliterate other country without being obliterated itself . 
  this is the only reason the cold war did n't end with nuclear war , and the only alternative to mad is complete worldwide disposal of nuclear weapons , which is n't going to happen any time soon . 
  from what i know , current state of anti-missile shields does not yet undermine the `` a '' in mad , at least when we 're speaking about us or russia ( thousands of missiles ) . 
  `` yet '' being the key word . 
  no shit our mod is nervous . 
  mad , ever heard of it ? 
  russia is n't limited to moscow . 
  since when it increases capability of others to threaten russia . 
  dude , do you even know what mad is ? 
  your sarcasm is poorly placed , since anti-missile shield could undermine mad balance . 
   usually you can tell who is the owner of the media company . 
  in russia they all are controlled by the goverment . 
  faulty logic right there . 
  bbc is 100 % owned by british government , yet nobody speaks of it as if it were `` controlled by the govenment '' . 
  rbc is owned by prokhorov , how exactly is it controlled by the government ?

  i just expanded it a little , i hope that 's okay . 
  original title :  medvedev responded to the accusations of navalny translated article :  prime minister dmitry medvedev responded to allegations of corruption during a conversation with workers at the tambov bacon plant . 
   `` to whom is this profitable ? 
  this is beneficial to those who order this kind of ( compromising ) stories , materials . 
  these are , as a rule , people who have quite specific political goals , '' medvedev said ( quoted by tass ) . 
   the investigation is `` sponsored by private investors '' who seek to `` pull people out into the streets , '' ( quoted by interfax )  oppositionist alexei navalny , who urged the population to go to rallies on march 26 , is called by medvedev as `` a famous character '' who openly declares his desire to become president . 
  he recalled that navalny has a criminal record . 
  the head of government said that `` young people are being put under a law enforcement car '' , which is unfair on the part of politicians who pursue their `` selfish interests '' . 
   compromising materials collected by the anti-corruption foundation ( fbk ) are called `` nonsense and papers '' by the prime minister , tass reports . 
  the investigation itself he described as `` compote '' , ria novosti reported . 
   `` and everything is done on the principle of `` compote '' : they take different dregs , nonsense , they gather it , if it concerns me , my acquaintances , people i 've never heard of at all , about some places where i have been and places that i have never heard of , they gather some papers , photographs , clothes , then create a product and present it , `` he said ( quoted by interfax ) . 
   medvedev noted that he continues to work , as he has `` strong nerves '' . 
   on march 2 , fbk published a large-scale investigation `` he 's not dimon '' , dedicated to the secret assets of medvedev . 
  fbk claims that the head of government purchased them for `` bribes of oligarchs and state bank loans '' using a `` criminal scheme '' based on non-profit foundations . 
  before that , medvedev and his representatives refused to comment on the investigation . 
   the lack of reaction of the authorities served as an occasion for rallies `` he is not dimon '' , which took place on march 26 in almost 100 cities of russia . 
  most of them were not coordinated , which led to mass detentions , including police detaining minors . 
   after the rallies , the russian academic fund called on medvedev to help organize events dedicated to fighting corruption for secondary and high school students . 
  then you 'd have an enormous anarchy state with nukes at your doors . 
  i do n't think that this would be the best solution :d, 
  google translation of the article :  russian president vladimir putin signed a law that allows russians who are under sanctions to not declare incomes and not pay taxes in russia in special cases . 
   the law acts retroactively - from january 1 , 2014 . 
   the bill was submitted to the state duma by a deputy from the united russia , andrei makarov , in march . 
   who specifically needs a new law , makarov did not explain . 
  as medusa learned , the amendments may be beneficial , first of all , to gennady timchenko , who paid taxes for many years in switzerland , but lives in russia because of the american sanctions . 
  this man has no shame left, 
   almost i see that you 're very optimistic :d, 
  there is no law in russia that says killing and abducting gaymen is okay . 
  there is a law that outlaws `` gay propaganda '' ( whatever that means ) and it does n't prohibits you from being gay ( this law is still a giant pile of shit , but it 's important to note that being gay is not a crime in russia ) . 
  chechnya is a veeeeeeery autonomous region , since kadyrov gets an enoromous amount of money from the kremlin to ensure that there wo n't be another war and he can do whatever he wants and in most cases there wo n't be any consequences . 
  basically kadyrov is a feudal lord and chechnya is his little personal feudal state . 
  it 's just disgusting , frankly . 
  islam in the volga region of russia is generally pretty liberal , since islam here has gone through the reformation known as [ jadidism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jadid ) .

  he was pretty liberal , that 's true . 
  but that does n't mean that he should n't be hold accountable for his wrongdoings . 
  bribing and lobbying are some serious allegations and should be investigated . 
  but i agree with you on the `` compromise '' part . 
  medvedev is n't a big threat to russia but just another cog in the putin 's absolutely rotten system . 
  putin himself should be number 1 priority . 
  i see 2 giant chinese flags on this map . 
  did you meant '' ... do n't see the us or chinese flag in the eu '' ? 
  almost . 
  russian flag was introduced during the reign of peter 's father alexis i. 
  he invited some dutch masters to build russia 's first frigate , presumably that 's when the russian flag was invented via rearranging the colors of the dutch flag . 
  i see . 
  fontanka reported that the truckers did that , but they asked a local activist , not the truckers themselves .

  they 're trying not to speak about it . 
  apparently , the most important news of the day is about eurovision, 
  it 's a protest against the prime-minister in specific and against the current government , including putin , in general . 
  depends on the city . 
  it 's hard to estimate , since protests are n't over yet , in petersburg there 're around 10,000 people . 
  again , depends on the city . 
  in some of them they 're arresting people . 
  so far more than 200 people in moscow were detained . 
  they want a reaction and the answers . 
  a film about the corruption of the prime-minister has been a huge phenomena ( more than 15 million views ) , but the goverment did n't react on it at all . 
  the goverment was trying to outlaw the protests , but in some cities they were officially approved ( kazan ) and the mayor of yekaterinburg praised the protest in his town . 
  doubt it, 
  that 's a temporary measure, 
  you do n't understand how it works . 
  you see , according to the 2014 statistics , there 're 148 russians in iceland therefore iceland is a rightful russian territory . 
  note that this method does n't work with other nations, 
  surely you meant `` the entire britanskaya oblast ' of the russian empire '',

  a world without nationalism was one that people without history education have a difficulty grasping .

   will keep doing so until borders get redrawn to better fit the nations there possibly , but also some nations are gaining national identity that supersedes their previous divisions . 
  iran looks fairly stable despite their diverse population and seems to have remained stable historically in times of strife . 
  iran is only 60 % persian , it 's not that much really . 
   millennia-old conflict between sunnis and shiites in islam . 
  piece of cake , three weeks work for un . 
  this bit . 
  the sarcasm and the old ` millennia-old ' shtick . 
  it 's not like i have n't heard it for a million times already , it 's really popular to post sarcastic posts regarding the ` futility of peace in the middle east ' which is really funny because practically nobody is aware of the fact that middle east was extremely peaceful compared to europe until europe came along and brought war into the middle east . 
  i 'm not saying europe is responsible for all their ills of course , but i am saying that people should drop the ` neverending conflict ' fallacy considering that if we could point to a single culprit that started the entire mess , it would be europeans in the first place . 
  fighting in syria is sectarian because assad created a minority government based on setting all the very small minorities against the sunni majority . 
  it is not simply sectarian in the sense that it 's a religious war between sunni and shia . 
  it is sectarian based on ethnic origins and their alignments with the government . 
  alawites , christians , some shiites ( but far from all ) versus most sunnis and then all of these versus the kurds , and then all of these versus the radical sunnis ( isis ) except that isis core was drawn from the baathist old guard of iraq , and they were a secular , pan-arab nationalist bunch , so it 's a bit interesting to wonder if the core of isis is truly comprised of religious radicals or if they 're cynical baathists using religion as a convenient unifying ideology in a region where it is impossible to unify people on the basis of nationalism . 
  did you ever find it interesting that european wars are rarely described as ` sectarian ' ? 
  even when they are ? 
  ` sectarian ' is a word we used to denote ` the savages of middle east ' . 
  war in donbass is sectarian because you have a portion who identify as russians and a portion who identify as ukrainians , but you do n't hear it ever being called that . 
  it 's simply not in fashion . 
  we have a lot of dog-whistle terms to belittle other cultures that we do n't even realise sometimes are condescending in their usage . 
  well , that 's russia , most people in the eu do n't consider russia to be representative of ` europe ' . 
  eu countries are pretty well settled and peaceful by now , though again , balkans that are now getting inducted into the eu were only recently just mass-murdering each other . 
  of course , at the same time , most ( almost all ) muslims do n't consider ksa to be representative of islam , and yet most of the west sees islam through saudi lens . 
  another thing to consider is the standoff between nato and the ussr . 
  we almost consumed the world in the fires of nuclear holocaust over the most pointless of bullshit and yet we have the gall to call muslims ` savages ' when we hear some calling for the deaths of the infidels . 
  obviously our method of mass murder is superior and more enlightened than theirs !, 
  / s yes , obviously europe has advanced further socially speaking , but in 500 years history will not treat the 20th century antics of europeans very kindly . 
  if we survive that long , we will treat europeans as a group of insane madmen who almost destroyed our world before we ascended to a higher plane of existence . 
  we will take the scientific achievements for granted , but not the nuclear standoff ( which in all fairness may have developed in a different continent just as easily , so perhaps it was just as ` granted ' as the technological progress ) edit : finally , as a post-script , a lot of people here ( including me at times ) fall into the [ whig history fallacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whig_history ) . 
  let us hope that we will continue to progress socially , but at the same time , that 's not guaranteed at all . 
  history often swings like a pendulum , a 23rd century society can very well be extremely socially conservative as a result of some future dramatic economic or military events that often push an open liberal society into a conservative closed one . 
  that 's funny , because the stereotype of the middle east being a land of neverending strife is pure racist and ignorant bullshit . 
  europe was the land of neverending warfare until second half of 20th century , it boasted the largest death totals from wars too . 
  of course , that `` does n't count '' but obviously when foreigners have wars they 're just people incapable of getting along unlike us . 
  compare that to the middle east , which comparatively speaking was one of the most peaceful regions of the world , a few external invasions aside ( such as the mongols ) . 
  it was n't until the european countries broke up the ottoman empire and then started drawing arbitrary borders and supplying countries with weapons , often times supplying to both sides -- it was n't until then that the middle east erupted . 
  look , i majored in history , some people probably had the chance to see my angry posts here before , but it really bothers me when people have such a smugly dismissive attitude when it 's complete bunk . 
  europe and us had the largest contribution in the destabilisation of the middle east whilst also being the largest warmongers , except if one were to receive their history education on / r/europe , you 'd think that europeans are a peaceful enlightened masterrace that totally was n't genociding each other almost into the 21st century and that muslims have always been violent savages whose religion compelled them to be barbaric ( when the violence is only religious on the surface , any serious historian will be able to see how most conflicts that we call ` religious ' actually have much deeper roots than edgy redditors would have us think ), 
  no it does not . 
  a moldovan made the claim we stole the money . 
  that 's an absurd statement with no proof . 
  i can make those too . 
  your mother is a whore and you are a paedophile . 
  it cost me nothing to make it and it is almost certainly false which is why the burden of proof is on me . 
  what a convincing argument , unfortunately it does n't answer my statements that i posted below my initial comment, 
  blacks were n't immigrants though . 
  they were slaves . 
  i 'm talking about the millions of eastern and southern euro immigrants , or the irish/scots . 
  `` diversity is skin deep '' . 
  there is so much wrong with your post , but did you for a moment consider that plenty of syrians and especially kurds are pretty white looking ? 
  at the least they can easily pass for a southern european after a few generations . 
  many balkan immigrants do n't look too different from the turks either ( not an accident , turks colonised them of course ) and yet we aren ' t using the muslim bosniaks as the scapegoat . 
  us has shown itself capable of integrating people of all ethnicities when it is n't busy oppressing them ( such as the blacks ) . 
  another problem with your post is that you 're implying that europeans are all blantant racists . 
  i 'm sure most of us would n't like to agree with you . 
  it 's like men who blame women for women wearing short clothes , which implies that men are wild animals who can not control themselves . 
  europeans can be above racism . 
  color of skin is n't the problem . 
   their economy is in shatters because it was the soviet policy that encouraged monoindustrialism as a means of locking both ukr and md into the russian sphere of influence . 
  that can be used to explain the moldovan state partially , given the transnistria , but ukraine was the agricultural and industrial heartland of ussr , with or without russia they had every element for future success . 
  between massive hydropower and nuclear power stations , ukraine had around 50 % of its electricity generated from renewable means when it broke off ussr . 
  it had massive steel and coal reserves . 
  all the farmland they needed to feed all of europe . 
  nations would kill for that sort of advantages . 
  and look what happened . 
  russia was a huge net importer of food for all its history . 
  we even imported * american * grain during cold war , a shameful admission of weakness . 
  yet after ussr we became world 's second largest exporter of grain . 
  what did ukraine do with its agriculture ? 
   the main idea is making russia a key element , a hub for their collective and individual well-being , so as to augment its status in spite of its otherwise limited means . 
  yes , the whole ` make tractor wheels in kazakhstan , engine in ukraine , frame in belarus and assemble it in russia ' example . 
  except that it still does n't explain the thousands of independent plants in ukraine -- and the fact that all the world 's industries do n't exist in a vacuum , they 're always interdependent . 
  you ca n't really make many excuses for ukraine . 
  moldova , absolutely . 
  they 're in a bad situation . 
  but blaming the stolen money on russia is just absurd . 
  there is exactly zero solid proof and somehow the fact that their government is corrupt is n't a more likely reason than shadowy russian machinations . 
  but again , easier to externalise the blame . 
  putin does the same . 
  russia has a problem ? 
  * the evil nazi-homo west did it * . 
  serbs and bosnians lived in the same place for centuries but still genocided each other . 
  so did germans and the jews , even though we all thought that by the mid 20th century germany was too enlightened and rational to do such a thing . 
  integration is all relative . 
  globalism hit europe faster , the immigrant communities it will affect slower , but eventually it will all come to pass and eu will have a single identity ( hopefully ) . 
  another question you may ask yourself is why did us take in so many immigrants and integrated them so well ? 
  perhaps you should start looking at yourself first before veering off into racist statements . 
  no rational person would ever say ` never ' to a particular foreign group being able to do something . 
  it implies that there is something wrong with that group racially that makes them different from ` le superior european masterrace ' . 
  yes , but it 's a source for national pride because serbia - a tiny balkan nation - stood against nato , a massive military alliance that was the most powerful fighting force of the 1990s . 
  and then even managed to give them something , such as outwitting them at the end of the war by proving that the nato claims of destroyed vehicles were bullshit and managing to strike back against state of the art weapons that should have been immune to recent aa weapons , let alone 50s and 60s vintage ones . 
  that 's why some serbs are proud of it , even though they were defeated . 
  every nation has countless ` hopeless war/battle ' legends that they are proud of . 
  it 's incredibly hypocritical to dismiss serbia 's experience unless you 're the least nationalist person out there . 
  which hey , i consider myself very anti-nationalist , i do n't think wars should be celebrated . 
  however very few americans i know of refuse to celebrate any of their past wars . 
  nationalism is very strong in us ( and russia ) . 
  what are you talking about ?

  kill the president ? 
  please do n't . 
  and bring back wendy 's .

  oh ha ha ha ha , you 're so funny . 
  here 's your upboat , you savage horseman of the steppes . 
  now let 's go raid towns and burn castles , for we are many , our bows are curved , our blood is hot . 
  i do . 
  and i dream of a greater europe , one that stretches from dublin to vladivostok . 
  thanks for the advice , man  underground you say ... 
  yeah . 
  i look up funny pictures with cats on my phone when i 'm supposed to be working . 
  dammit europe , get your shit together , those percentages are not high enough ahahahahahahaha, 
  you 're a fucking retard . 
  i did the fascist schtick ironically , you picky polizei . 
  okay , let 's rephrase : everyone who cheers on people 's deaths is a fucking disgusting animal , a coward and a little whiny shit . 
  i 'd pay top dollar to watch people who hold such views to openly share them with a group of people they hold in contempt . 
  it 's just banter , man . 
  we 're having a pissing contest . 
  sure i did . 
  i 'm betting someone in this thread keeps his grandpa 's ss uniform in the attic , haha . 
  this kind of logic does n't justify the line of thought you 've described . 
  also it paints a picture about what kind of values people like that hold . 
  and it 's an ugly picture . 
  disregard for human life , no respect for the dead . 
  try saying shit like that to the grieving relatives . 
  when you 're anonymous and online you 're all fucking heroes . 
  i am not an employee of a troll factory , i 'm overqualified for that kind of jobs . 
  i 'm an honest to god enthusiast . 
  since when you became the chosen emissary of the united european people ? 
  how the fuck this is an alien subreddit , last time i checked europe stretched all the way to the east , up to the ural mountains . 
  russia is culturally european , despite what you may think . 
  your cursory knowledge of russian politics is very black and white . 
  please provide links to evidence of someone getting a career opportunity in the parliament for shouting `` annex x and fuck all the x '' . 
  i like it how you picked last 300 years . 
  should we be butthurt about polish-lithuanian invasion of russia in the 17th century ? 
  maybe you guys started it first and cemented yourself as an existential threat that needs to be dealt with in historical context ? 
  or maybe even go to the 16th century , to muscovite wars when poland was allied with lithuania ? 
  you were the one who started with exaggerated claim about being shat upon 24/7 . 
  you give yourself too much credit , there 's only one post on / r/russia currently on the main page that has anything to do with the baltic states . 
  besides , we do n't cheer on when your countrymen die . 
  post proofs of russians cheering on a plane crash * en masse * or you 're a fascist , 
  and then they sent him to a gas chamber !, 
  and kremlin exploded !, 
  the first one from the top is a discussion about savchenko , second one mocks the ukrainian army seeing `` little green men '' everywhere , third one from the top is a screenshot of a ukrainian news source that claims that the crashed jet is actually hidden near rostov on don and will be blown up in ukrainian or turkish skies . 
  the third post from the top is a legit reason for laughs in my book . 
  used the following link : http://pikabu.ru/tag/%d0%a3%d0%ba%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%b0/new comments range from tired jokes about the silly `` khokhol '' to mild verbal attacks at savchenko 's physical appearance ( she does n't seem to have lost much weight during her hunger streak ) . 
  pretty average stuff , did n't see any mockery of dead people or anyone wishing death upon a whole ethnic group . 
  although i just skimmed through . 
  okay . 
  the guy in the article is an asshole . 
  i felt like going for a long-worded way of calling lots of people assholes , so it was n't analytical or even pseudo-analytical - i was getting at stereotypes , as is tradition on public forums . 
  we 're all friends here so do n't tense up . 
  enlighten me about what `` my people '' say about ukrainians . 
  i would n't know , mostly because it 's not a topic for discussion around here . 
  now the abrupt end of the syrian operation is the hot topic . 
  jesus h. christ , where are you getting this from ? 
  it 's not on the down-low , you can walk by a construction site and see signs in turkish . 
  people are fully capable of differentiating between , you know , the government of the country and its populace . 
  pfft , take no offense . 
  it 's the anonymity of the internet that brings out the worst in us as a species . 
  people who say things like that come from countries in which highest point in history was to become a judenfrei province of the reich , highest aspiration for their people - rid the world of the pesky russkies ( the invaders , the ugly aliens , etc. ), 
  along with other lesser folks while wearing a stylish black uniform ( in the name of reclaiming their land , of course , the end justifies the means and all that ) . 
  so , they have their own rationale to be butthurt . 
  if they take it out on ordinary victims of a plane crash - it 's a testament to their inferiority complex , lack of moral compass and overall weakness of character . 
  edit : everyone who downvotes this post is a descendant of a butthurt hilfspolizei , 
  dude , a lot of russia 's new buildings ( moscow city office towers , apartment complexes ) are built by a turkish firm renessaince construction . 
  it 's an `` international firm '' though , so business as usual . 
  after reading comments in this thread i want to party with british tourists . 
  why ? 
  do you only accept academic sources ? 
  are all youtube videos fabricated and staged ? 
  i made up the term . 
  can i copyright it ? 
  true that . 
  let 's go youtubing then . 
  http://youtu.be/y1tepjmfh9g - vice documentary `` london 's holy turf war '' . 
  http://youtu.be/nw2w7acogay - some other video about muslim patrols in east london . 
  i was going to post a link about a paris no-go zone , but it appears a piece by fox news was debunked by french media and fox news actually apologized for it . 
  maybe some londeners/parisians will pitch it to this thread regarding their perception of no-go zones in their home cities . 
  here 's a whole bunch of muslims during a prayer in moscow for good measure : http://youtu.be/xfkq57abqac social media sites lose their shit here every year during kurban bayram , haha . 
  correct . 
  i 've posted a link to a sketchy video as an example previously . 
  i can post more , but there 's no reason to - i 'm not trying to prove anything or to further an agenda , just sharing observations . 
  quick googling yields multiple results for sharia zones/patrols both in london in paris . 
  surely the issue is overblown by certain media outlets , but there 's also no smoke without fire . 
  calais jungle is not imaginary . 
  did some quick googling , were n't able to find the source . 
  so i guess my personal observation will have to do for now . 
  as a muscovite , born and raised , i can say that ethnic ghettos do n't pop out around here ( despite the fact that moscow houses 2-3 million guest workers and immigrants ) due to the enormous `` sleeping districts '' on the outskirts of the city , a.k.a commie blocks , which allow the migrants to spread out evenly via renting flats .

   efforts to protect the united states from the perceived threat of communist subversion were particularly enabled by several federal laws . 
  the alien registration act or smith act of 1940 made it a criminal offense for anyone to `` knowingly or willfully advocate , abet , advise or teach the [ ... ] desirability or propriety of overthrowing the government of the united states or of any state by force or violence , or for anyone to organize any association which teaches , advises or encourages such an overthrow , or for anyone to become a member of or to affiliate with any such association '' . 
  hundreds of communists and others were prosecuted under this law between 1941 and 1957 . 
  eleven leaders of the communist party were convicted under the smith act in 1949 in the foley square trial . 
  ten defendants were given sentences of five years and the eleventh was sentenced to three years . 
  the defense attorneys were cited for contempt of court and given prison sentences . 
  [ 33 ] in 1951 , twenty-three other leaders of the party were indicted , including elizabeth gurley flynn , a founding member of the american civil liberties union . 
  many were convicted on the basis of testimony that was later admitted to be false . 
  [ 34 ] by 1957 , 140 leaders and members of the communist party had been charged under the law , of whom 93 were convicted . 
  that 's the `` circuses '' part . 
  done that . 
  however , mother 's name was disclosed by the moscow times anyway . 
  [ fb page ] ( http://imgur.com/a/hyjqt ) of the mother of one of the students , that 's what caused all the fuss .

  is that an excuse for the westerners to be mean to russians ? 
  if so , do n't expect any positive changes in the future . 
  it works both ways and i bet you know it . 
  bitching about the past is not the same as endorsing an ethnic cleansing in the present . 
  expansion of nato is always portrayed ( at least , by the state-owned media ) as aggressive conspiracy of the u.s. . as for china ... 
  i 've yet to meet anyone who really believes in partnership with china . 
  but that 's only anecdotal evidence . 
  the western sanctions are seen as the price to be paid for the annexation . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  honestly , i do n't get what `` we '' do and where . 
  i would n't say no . 
  cheers . 
  as long as they keep visa-free access for russian tourists , i have no objection to that decision , haha .

  hi , thank your for your contribution , but this submission has been removed because it is low quality or effort .

  high inflation continued unabated for several years . 
   i believed in the need for a strong social safety net , partly funded by the west . 
  this was not accomplished . 
  the health care system , for example , fell into shocking collapse . 
   i believed that the west should provide large-scale and timely foreign assistance to russia , as it had to poland . 
  the united states and the imf rejected this advice . 
  russia fell into a deep balance of payments crisis . 
   i believed that russia should `` commercialize '' its enterprises by turning them into corporations with state ownership . 
  this was generally done . 
   i believed that russia 's privatization should be quick but transparent and law-based . 
  care should be taken to prevent corruption . 
  this was not done . 
  the privatizers went ahead outside of transparency and the law . 
  corruption and insider dealing were rampant . 
   i believed that the large natural resource companies should remain in state hands . 
  this was to ensure that the russian government got the revenues from the production of metals , hydrocarbons , and other valuable commodities . 
  this was not done . 
  the natural resource sector was corruptly privatized , giving rise to the new oligarchy . 
   my area of responsibility for advising was macroeconomics , not privatization . 
  i had no responsibility for the corrupt privatization , though i was often blamed wrongly for it . 
  i actually opposed it strenuously , but was no longer even an advisor to the russian government when it occurred ( especially 1994-1996 ) . 
  meanwhile , it seems the us continues to support everything poroshenko is doing , even appointment of poroshenko 's _ kum _ without legal education as prosecutor general : * [ biden welcomes lutsenko 's appointment as ukraine 's prosecutor general ] ( http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/343311.html ) * [ u.s. to move forward with $ 1 billion loan guarantee for ukraine ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/us-move-forward-1-billion-loan-guarantee-ukraine-biden-poroshenko-imf/27734003.html ) i remember all these talks during the euromaidan -- russian $ 15 billion loan will be just stolen and eaten away by corrupt ukrainian government , but money from the west are totally different , the west will only give ukraine money with strings attached , it will greatly help to reform ukraine , etc. 
  heh , so much for that . 
  the article in question http://www.rudnikov.com/article.php?element_id=27962 ( [ google translate ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.rudnikov.com%2farticle.php%3felement_id%3d27962 ) ) . 
   the government will need a good explanation to limit it on their own . 
  they already have a `` good explanation '' . 
  actually , many of them . 
  terrorism , `` think of the children '' , foreign western enemy agents , protecting our people from fraudsters , `` internet should be safe '' , etc. , etc. 
  -- select any combination you like . 
  rip rbc . 
  so these raids were not just a coincidence -- just like expected . 
  one of the last quality not pro-putin major news website , _ the _ last quality tv . 
  rbc probably was a bit too extreme for russia -- it invited aviation expert vadim lukashevich that debunked `` ukrainian pilot '' version of mh-17 crash , reported about panama papers , putin 's daughters and stuff like that . 
  i read vedomosti so far , but if the vedomosti will be cleansed as well , there will be nowhere to go . 
  poroshenko & co. are hardly any better . 
   that does n't change the fact it 's more like a joke of a state it 's not a fact , it 's your opinion . 
  some people have trouble understanding the difference . 
   their country to some bunch of peasants and thugs . 
  actually , donetsk oblast and luhansk oblast have the highest level of urbanization in the whole ukraine , 80-90 % of people there live in cities and towns . 
  and i am sure that all 4 million people who live in dnr and lnr are nothing more than thugs . 
  the whole parade : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lq_ai9m_l4, 
  crimean population never wanted to be part of ukraine in the first place and it overwhelmingly supported reunification with russia even after 23 years of independence . 
  bolsheviks painted some funny borders on the map , ignoring ethnic composition or opinion of locals , e.g. 
  moved mostly armenian nagorno-karabakh to azerbaijan . 
  after the collapse of the soviet union this whole artificial system collapsed as well . 
   while justified by the political instability and lack of judicial independence in certain countries , the arbitration clause has no place in an agreement between countries that respect the rule of law , the expert said . 
   `` it is wholly unnecessary in countries that are party to the international covenant on civil and political rights , which commits states to due process and the rule of law , '' he added . 
  it 's just too funny . 
  almost all countries in the world are parties of the [ international covenant on civil and political rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_covenant_on_civil_and_political_rights ) , including such upstanding countries respecting the rule of law as syria , eritrea , north korea , and zimbabwe . 
  there are plenty of pro-russians in the baltic states , that 's why they are so busy fighting against russian `` propaganda '' ( aka media with a point of view they do n't like ) . 
  other countries are geographically and culturally are too far away from russia and too close to other centers of power , it 's no wonder russia has no significant influence on them . 
  after all russia is a relatively weak country . 
  serbia is a landlocked country , it 's surrounded from each and every side by eu , nato , or nato-wannabes -- what else it supposed to do ? 
  i 'm not sure it 's correct to claim that serbia is a more successful country than , say , belarus , see [ their gdp ] ( https://www.google.ru/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:blr:ukr:pol:rom:srb:rus:kaz&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) . 
  i read the article `` crimea is ukraine '' by stomakhin that guy reposted . 
  it included stuff like `` russia should be defeated in a war , destroyed by military means and erased from the world map '' , proposal `` to drown in a sea or to burn in ovens '' the `` moskals '' that voted on the crimean referendum , claim that every decent russian should support the caucasus emirate ( designated terrorist organization by russia/un/us / uk/uae ) . 
  the picture he reposted contained text encouraging to actively destroy russia like the chechens tried . 
  probably it was n't smart to post things like that on your vk profile . 
   half-finished high-rise buildings , in which whole families live in poverty and without basic services , are dotted with satellite dishes that mostly broadcast russian programs . 
  they deliver a powerful message to georgian homes : you belong to us . 
  those damn russians . 
  forced these poor people to install satellite dishes and watch evil russia propaganda . 
  in western media people ca n't be just genuinely pro-russian due to their historical , cultural , personal or economic ties . 
  they must be brainwashed by russian propaganda . 
  `` had to accept '' ? 
  under the barrel of gun , yeah , i forgot about that part of ukrainian mythology . 
  ukrainian media probably had to invent some bs to explain way why the hell  99 % of `` occupied '' crimean population received their russian passports without any resistance . 
  of course they were not satisfied with unpleasant truth -- crimeans were not forced , they just do n't want to live in ukraine , far poorer and less developed country than russia , in country with weird ukrainian nationalists in the government that all the time wanted to forcefully ukrainise them . 
   uh if you checked the referrendum you 'd know the only choice was to go back to russia that 's not true , but i agree that referendum was n't perfect , there were irregularities and signs of rigging . 
  however , since then there were a lot polls conducted both by russians and western pollsters . 
  they confirm that majority recognize the referendum , ~ 90 % supported reunification with russia , while only 2-3 % support going back to ukraine . 
   how about you ask the local tartars how they feel about russian occupation . 
  50/50 according to the polls i 've seen and they are just ~ 10 % of total population . 
  note that there was no exodus from crimea , they still live in crimea as they lived before . 
  russia takes some steps to please the crimean tatars . 
  for example , russia recognised deported crimean tatars as victims of stalin 's repressions and gave them benefits like halving their utility costs . 
  it 's amazing how much liberal progressive pro-democratic europeans want to gift crimea back to ukraine against the will of 90 % of crimean local population . 
  no , it 's not going to happen again , crimeans are not serfs to gift them without their consent like livestock -- with or without putin . 
  why so many sarcastic comments ? 
  you may disagree with sweden politics and so on , but what is wrong when the whole city unites on a memorial ceremony ? 
  at least it 's better than filters on facebook profile pictures and lighting national monuments up . 
  it 's the natural way to mourn the victims . 
  also , i used metro yesterday and the train brought me right to the improvised memorial on technolozhka 's platform . 
  there was a sea of flowers and a lot of silent people were standing around it in circle . 
  i 've joined the crowd for a minute . 
  it felt very nice -- genuine and non-official . 
  it 's interesting that both perpetrators in stockholm and st. petersburg were uzbeks . 
  our terrorist was an ethnic uzbek from kyrgyzstan who got russian citizenship few years ago . 
  the perpetrator in [ 2017 istanbul nightclub shooting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_istanbul_nightclub_shooting ) was an uzbek as well . 
  combined heat and power plants , i think . 
  moscow gets almost all of its energy from thermal power plants burning natural gas , which are placed right in the city . 
  it has no nuclear power plant or anything . 
  moscow has some nice modern buildings : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhmjydr_hcq, 
  that 's some red scare-tier scaremongering . 
  so they used the second most used traffic analysis tool in the web after google analytics : https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/traffic_analysis/all gotcha !, 
  i would not be surprised if these damn spies use nginx as well !, 
  this level of anti-russian sentiments is unhealthy already . 
  i do n't remember even our `` patriots '' searching for google analytics in state-affiliated sites -- there are a lot of it btw . 
   the article by boris stomakhin `` crimea is ukraine !, 
  '' , beginning and ending with the words : `` the collapse of  that 's pretty clearly political criticism .

  3 ) russia started to openly shell encircled ukrainian forces from russian territory with grads and heavy artillery . 
  the first major instance of that shelling happened on july 12 , when 19 soldiers ( or even more , up to 50-70 , according to unofficial estimates ) were killed in a grad ( tornado-g , as ua officials claim ) attack under zelenopolye . 
  the situation for the encircled started to become increasingly grim . 
  ua soldiers were not able to return fire , because the attackers were on russian territory , so they were basically just targets for russian artillery . 
  various ua journalists , activists , wives of the soldiers immediately started to ask to do something with them , to redeploy the encircled deeper in ukraine to make it possible to fire back . 
  however , brilliant ukrainian generals did nothing , except lying every day that encircled forces were unblocked , and responding `` hang in there !, 
  '' , `` do n't give up ! '', 
  on reports about shelling from russia from the encircled servicemen . 
  during these 3 weeks the ua forces on the border suffered significant casualties , lost most of their military equipment and vehicles , and basically became unfit for action . 
  what happened today is not yet clear . 
  rnbo claims that there was a `` planned operation '' carried out at 4:30 , part of the encircled forces near to chervonopartisansk were able to break through , another part retreated to russia . 
  they lie all the time , so i have no idea if it 's true or not . 
  servicemen that were able to call to their relatives after the event say something like that : `` alive . 
  not in russia '' , `` we did n't surrender . 
  we are at gukovo '' , `` we did n't desert , we carried out orders '' . 
  bbc journalist who saw at gukovo says that they destroyed their weapons , while their apcs were long time destroyed by enemy fire . 
  [ list of `` botopedias '' ] ( http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%92%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%bf%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b8%d1%8f:%d0%91%d0%be%d1%82%d0%be%d0%bf%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b8%d1%8f#.d0.a2.d0.b0.d0.b1.d0.bb.d0.b8.d1.86.d0.b0 ) in ru-wiki . 
  dutch and swedish wikipedias have ~ 2/3 bot-created articles and ~ 1/2 bot-edits . 
  without these articles they would not be able to even reach top 10 . 
   the last independent russian tv news show was cancelled about 10 years ago . 
  yes , approximately when parfyonov was kicked from ntv . 
   a russian who posts 90 % of the time in / r/ukraina / of course , that 's bs about 90 % , i had been active on reddit for years before / r/ukraina even existed , but yeah , i post there under `` st. petersburg '' flair . 
  it 's a russian-speaking subreddit , and there are plenty of other russians there . 
  ukraine is and will be at least for a while the dominating topic of discussions in russia . 
   i 've heard it all now no . 
  not really . 
  well , it 's sorta not the strongest possible response . 
  i did n't just said `` hrw sucks '' , but explained why i do n't trust that particular their report . 
  i would also love to hear your counter-arguments against the evidence cited in the two threads on / r/ukraina i linked to . 
  btw , hrw report contains other funny bits , like :  ukrainian authorities should order all their forces , ** including volunteer forces , to immediately stop using grads ** in or near populated areas , and insurgent forces should avoid deploying in densely populated areas so , in the opinion of hrw , pro-ukrainian volunteer forces have grads . 
  it 's such a pathetic article . 
  blah-blah-blad bad , unprofessional ua army randomly kill civilians with its stone age military technology . 
  i do n't know where to start : 1 . 
  there are around 500 killed ukrainian servicemen/members of volunteer battalions ( according to the list in ukrainian wikipedia ) and at least ~ 1000 ( i took the lowest reasonable estimate ) killed pro-russian militants . 
  so even if 800 civilians were killed ( this looks like an overestimation ) , it 's around half of killed combatants from both sides . 
  check nato bombing of yugoslavia -- ~ 1000 killed combatants , and at least 500 killed civilians . 
  or take [ 2003 invasion of iraq ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_iraq ) . 
  or take the current gaza war . 
  it 's just a large-scale , intensive conflict , thanks to russia the ` rebels ' armed with heavy artillery , tanks and grads , and sadly civilian deaths are inevitable against well armed enemy . 
  it seems that these guys without much doubt attribute most if not all of civilian casualties to the actions of ukrainian army . 
  while of course ua army killed some civilians ( and some of their servicemen with friendly fire ) , no doubt that majority were killed by the separatists . 
  kidnappings , murders , killing people on checkpoints , mining everything with anti-personnel mines ( forbidden in ukraine ) , etc. , etc. 
  but probably the most lethal was their terrorist tactics to intentionally shell residential areas with mortars and grads to put the blame on ua army . 
  while it 's widely supported by [ the available ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ukraina/comments/2c4maz/%d0%bf%d0%be%d0%bc%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%82%d0%b5_%d0%bf%d0%be%d1%81%d1%82_%d0%b2_%d0%ba%d0%be%d1%82%d0%be%d1%80%d0%be%d0%bc_%d0%bc%d1%8b_%d1%81%d0%be%d0%b1%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%b8_%d0%b4%d0%be%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%b7%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b5%d0%bb%d1%8c%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%b0/ ) [ evidence ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ukraina/comments/2ar39b/%d0%be%d1%87%d0%b5%d0%bd%d1%8c_%d0%bd%d1%83%d0%b6%d0%bd%d0%be_%d0%b4%d0%be%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%b7%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b5%d0%bb%d1%8c%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%b0_%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b3%d0%be_%d1%87%d1%82%d0%be_%d1%81%d0%b5%d0%bf%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b8%d1%81%d1%82%d1%8b/ ) , while it 's the official version of the ua authorities , and most ua journalists -- i did n't see a single article in the western media about the issue , nobody even tried to at least investigate it . 
  then they uncritically repeat findings of the hrw `` report '' . 
  hrw ... fuck hrw , seriously . 
  i read their report , and it 's just a piece of garbage . 
  the only `` proof '' of ua guilt they got -- they found directions of the shellings . 
  in most of the cases they described ( i am not sure about maryinka shelling myself ) just having the direction of the shelling was not enough -- there were _ both _ ua and separatist forces in these direction . 
  for example , they found that pervaya ploschadka ( donetsk ) was shelled from the west on july 19 . 
  ok , look at the map , separatists controlled krasnogorovka 15km on the west from the pervaya ploschadka , minimal range of grad is 5 km , separatists were easily able to carry out that attack . 
  then they blame ua army for july 21 shelling of kuybushevskyy district of donetsk , while there are very good reasons that it was committed by separatists from avdiivka , e.g. 
  there is a video [ recorded that day at 12:00 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5jhx1a4t98 ) how grad positioned near to avdiivka shell in the direction of kuybushevskyy district ; locals [ immediately identified ] ( https://imgur.com/ac604bl ) that donetsk was shelled from avdiivka direction ( before the video was even published ) , and even pointed to yakovlevka ; the direction of shelling from the north is confirmed by the shells ( see e.g. 
  [ this article ] ( http://pauluskp.com/news/3830485f6 ) ) . 
  but nope , hrw ignored all and every piece of evidence and blamed for this attack ua army : `` human rights watch investigation on the ground strongly indicates that ukrainian government forces were responsible for the attacks that occurred between july 12 and 21 . '', 
  screened or not , it 's interesting to know how prevalent these views are . 
  if one idiot said something like that aloud , there are many thousands who think along these lines . 
  and considering comments i read on israeli news sites , `` many thousands '' is an underestimation . 
  not that it 's surprising for a country at war ( e.g. 
  during chechen wars , there were plenty of people who proposed to just kill all chechens ) , but it 's still a problem . 
  however anti-israel hysteria ( and this article of course will be used to fuel it ) is just as annoying . 
   sounds like vice or news republic would be your preferred journalistic style . 
  vice news is not a major news outlet . 
  yes , i think that simon ostrovsky probably is the best reporter on this war for non-russian/ukrainian speaking folks . 
  for russian-speakers local citizen journalists in twitter are still much better though . 
   i agree that these news outlets are n't doing in depth military analysis of the conflict each and every day . 
  well , in sloviansk after 2 month of war even some old ladies were able distinguish bmp from nona , while for these reporters every armored caterpillars vehicle still is a `` tank '' . 
  ok , apparently they do n't have to be military experts to report on a war , or even have any idea about military aspect at all ( seriously , you do n't need to be a military expert to distinguish a bmp from a tank ) , but they probably shine in other areas ? 
  maybe in covering deep political background , social and day-to-day life issues ? 
  nope , coverage of all other topics are just as bad and shallow as their coverage of the military aspect . 
   as for the ` united ' comment i think it 's fairly obvious that the nation is in fact not united , but is fragmented in civil war . 
  hardly a distorted view . 
  naming this conflict a `` civil war '' and is a prime example of a view distorted by all this reporting with `` rebels '' , etc. 
   well the bbc , reuters , guardian , independent , times , itv etc all are reporting on the ukraine situation and have reporters on the ground i opened the bbc site , the top report on ukraine is this thingie : [ ukraine mh17 : rebels ambush army convoy near crash site ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28599315 ) . 
  reported by tom burridge from kyiv . 
  nobody would argue that he reported it `` from the ground '' , however , this ground was more than 600km far away from the events he reported about . 
  the ambushed convoy was ~ 20km from grabovo , maybe from kyiv it looks `` near crash site '' , but for the conflict it 's not `` near '' at all . 
  then he retold official statements of ato press center and official twitter of dnr . 
  then a video fragment showing how an osce observer is returning to his car from a toilet , tucking his pants , few more videos of osce observers and ua military moving around . 
  this report is over . 
  then there is a report by a guy who actually visited shakhtarsk -- that 's good , however , his visit was absolutely useless -- few sentimental interviews with crying civilians , that 's all you can get from it . 
  he did n't say in a single word e.g. 
  why shakhtarsk is so strategically important for both ua army and `` rebels '' . 
  not a single word that `` rebels '' also have strong artillery in shakhtarsk ( including 120mm mortars , tanks , self-propelling 122m howitzers `` gvozdika '' , grads , etc. 
  ) , and that they happily shell the city with all this stuff . 
  in the end he makes the following abstruse statement : `` ukrainian forces are seems to be determined to retake the territory controlled by rebels , but no sign yet that they can unite the nation '' -- dude , maybe you should visit sloviansk or kramatorsk to get such a sign ? 
  or read the latest survey showing that the ukrainian nation is more united than ever ? 
  the report is over . 
  that 's basically is an example of very poor superficial reporting and non-existing analysis you are able to get only a very vague and distorted idea what 's going on in the area . 
   i ca n't recall a time where any of the newspapers/outlets have published a story which was complete bullshit with zero evidence or factual backing . 
  what about secret putin-merkel pact invented by the independent ? 
  they surely double checked this stuff . 
   maybe you need to start watching/reading different news outlets . 
  thanks , i am already doing this . 
  nope , these `` major news outlets '' 1 ) actually publish a lot of bullshit 2 ) do n't report noteworthy events at all , with or without `` double check '' . 
  in a result consumer of these `` major news outlets '' have more distorted world-view than persons who gather information from other sources , like non-mainstream or social media . 
  at least it 's true if we are talking about the situation around ukraine . 
  it only shows the pathetic state of these `` major news media '' . 
  it 's a sad state of affairs when you are able to get better information ( more correct , in-depth , etc. ), 
  from mashable and buzzfeed than from bbc or cnn .

  sick mythology reference , bro . 
  i guess you found me out . 
  i guess i 'll go cash that huge putin paycheck now . 
  edit : did you even understand what i said in the prev . 
  post ? 
  how 's your german ? 
  did you pay attention in school ? 
  god , i hate the `` putin-versteher '' term so much . 
  it 's basically an old , dusty and obvious tool where if you try to understand where your adversary is coming from ( i 'm not a putin fan btw ) , you instantly labeled a traitor to the cause . 
  it implies that you are trying to understand something that is inherently irrational and evil , thus labelling you insane for trying to understand `` the devil '' and since you are trying to undestand the incomprehensible , you are somehow sympathetic to its goals . 
  like suggesting that someone is dealing with the devil . 
  so is it wrong to understand putin ? 
  he may be a fucking asshole , but his motives are perfectly understandable if you look into it . 
  edit : i do n't understand the downvotes . 
  a russian flair is apparently all that matters , even if mostly i share your fucking opinion . 
  all i did was write somethig about a figure of polit-speak that is used against many others , not only putin . 
  but keep on circlejerking , if that 's what you do here . 
  you shill, 
  well , lots of people just fled before the soviets came in . 
  then maybe you should have looked at the comment that i was replying to , ** before ** you posted :  white washing the sins of the most deadliest and evil ideology and regime the planet has ever faced, 
  what i mean is that when people say `` the worst regime in history '' , i kinda wonder whether i grew up in the same soviet union that these internet people are talking about . 
  also , the family album was an allegory for my family and their friends having had lots of good times . 
  plenty of difficult ones , too , although generally those were mostly after 1992 . i myself have had more shitty experiences since i moved to the west a couple years ago . 
  and we were all working class , just regular shlubs , no party members , some were even denied komsomol membership due to some remote german ancestry . 
  my grandparents worked in a machine all their lives . 
  and if we 're talking about judging a regime from outside by its foreign policy , then i guess millions of brown and asian people would like a word with you about what the most evil regime ever was . 
  ussr ! = nazi germany, 
  til that even ussr pacifists were just butthurt warmongers in disguise . 
  thank you , ukrainian friend , for your history lesson . 
  maybe because the ussr was not entirely evil ? 
  edit : downvotes ? 
  are you people really unable to acknowledge , that the ussr was not literally mordor 100 % of the time ? 
  i swear to god , i have a bunch of good ( and bad ) memories and a photo album full of pictures of happy family members enjoying theimselves . 
  little did they know , they were living in hell . 
  you talking to yourself is not a conversation . 
  it 's an echochamber monologue . 
  ukraine is fighting the dnr right now . 
  [ good , i can feel your anger . 
  i am defenseless . 
  take your weapon . 
  strike me down with all of your hatred and your journey towards the dark side will be complete !, 
  ] ( http://www.theforce.net/kids/coruscant/probe_droid/palpatine.jpg ), 
  so why are the ukrainians fighting with he russians instead of against them ? 
  remember , dnr has almost 2 million people vs. a couple thousand russians that are there allegedly . 
  also , the rebellion was well underway before the russians even sent their troops . 
  but why do you think people rebelled in the first place ? 
  methinks russian propaganda is not strong enough to send an entire region of peaceful people into civil war . 
  those people have their reasons , life was n't very rosy for them apparently . 
  that ca n't defeat a bunch of former farmers , miners and steel mill workers ? 
  even if there are some russians with their weapons there , dnr still mainly consists of the local population . 
  traumatic ? 
  being an immigrant ai n't that bad , you get adjusted . 
  source : my life . 
  no , but by following a ham-fisted and simplified narrative like straight outta lord of the rings `` evil putler is plotting evil things in mordor '' or star wars ( evil emperor , noble rebels ) is not exactly making me trust the western media . 
  we ** know ** from all of world history that the world is not as black and white as it 's ususally portrayed , and we ** know ** the russia issue to be kinda complex , so whenever we encounter a black and white narrative for retards like that , we assume it 's probably spun in someone 's interests . 
  to russians , obviously other things matter more than the ruble exchange rate , which is not insane , i would argue . 
  meanwhile you keep repeating the same shit over and over , even when the ** actual russian opposition ** disagrees . 
   putin is at least in some way responsible as the current climate in russia was created by his government . 
  you are absolutely right . 
  i guess you solved the murder mystery all by yourself , have n't you ? 
  and all that without even getting out of your armchair , wow !, 
  nah , this is pulled out of context . 
  they were reporting on how some people on the internet are comparing tyagnibok to himmler and photoshopping fake bills with hitler 's face . 
  i think the announcer just accidentally a word so it sounds like a literal accusation , but that does n't make any sense . 
  it was in a segment about internet memes . 
  sounded more like the announcer missed a word ( '' \u0447\u0442\u043e '' ) , because they put it in the internet meme segment . 
  i 'd imagine that if this was something they 'd really wan na accuse the ukrainians with , they would make a bigger bit about it and really beat the shit out of it , not just mention it in 2 seconds ? 
  true enough . 
  the main reason some people vote putin is that all other candidates are either so insane or incapable ( or a communist ) that putin actually seems pretty solid . 
  giant douche or turd sandwich , man . 
  yes , quite, 
  dude we totally need it . 
  just gon na hold onto it for two more weeks max , ok ? 
  we 're doing dope shit with it, 
   regular country tell me more, 
  naww , we just messin with you , dog, 
  i agree about migrants ( sort of ) but the op is about refugees . 
  all this is about refugees and terrorists . 
  there would still be terrosists without any physical migration though due to the conversion of europeans though . 
  white people with white ancestors are converting to islamic ( and other ) extremism through isis propaganda . 
  this whole thread is about how there are `` secret sleeper terrorists '' among the refugees that are now coming to europe with the op as proof . 
  with people circlejerking to the point where they think they are being `` overrun '' . 
  my point is that refugees have little to do with extremists or rather are an independent issue . 
  those guys can board a plane in morocco and be here tomorrow . 
  or they can be recruited from eu citizens . 
  all of the paris guys were eu citizens , not refugees . 
  they were also known to have ties to terrorism . 
  this problem existed well before the refugee crisis . 
  you really think `` bad guys '' will travel for weeks with poor migrants and sleep in miserable conditions when they can just as easily get a tourist visa ( or even cross borders illegally ) , come to any country and blow shit up ? 
  that 's not appropriate here, 
  anyone can get a visa and buy a plane ticket . 
  fucking bin laden ( god rest his soul ) can get a false passport and a visa and go to sweden via plane , ship or car . 
  the orchestrators of charlie hebdo and paris shootings were eu citizens . 
  isis recruits people directly in the eu . 
  how the fuck are the refugees part of any of this ? 
  think logically , people, 
  with 742 million people in the eu vs. a couple million immigrants , i am sure the eu will be literally overrun . 
  an then they will take your job , fuck your wife and murder your kid . 
  do you even hear yourself talk ? 
  sorry bro , it 's in my garage and i sorta lost the keys .

  ooxml is not a single standard , but a collection of three standards : ecma 376 , iso/iec 29500 transitional , iso/iec 29500 strict . 
  these three standards are not fully compatible . 
  only the latter one ( strict ) is similar to odf and can be used as its substitution , the first two are not open and are no better than doc in that regard . 
  the support for strict has been added to ms office only in its 2013 version , and , guess what , it 's not the default !, 
  it seems that ms have tricked everyone into believing that they are making an open format , but we ended up with the same proprietary bullshit . 
   i think we mostly agree , i just do n't like when the problems are always blamed on `` linux '' , as if it 's somehow a fault with linux , when in fact it is almost always lack of vendor support . 
  i do n't like this either , but the truth is that users just do n't care about whose fault is this . 
  they want their pc to do things they want and to not be frustrated in the process . 
  if linux ca n't do that for whatever reason , they 'll just switch back to windows . 
  when i wrote this , i meant solely the present day situation . 
  i 'm sure linux has a potential to do this in the future , and i really hope it does as i do n't like the direction microsoft is heading to . 
  my major stumbling block for home use is gaming but , if cross-platform vulkan and opengl take over directx ( which is possible considering the rapidly rising mobile gaming market ) , this can change . 
  i 'm not talking about switching to libreoffice , i 'm talking about the microsoft 's proprietary standard . 
  if they make odf default in ms office ( unlikely ) , or even if they just make the ms office . docx format compliant with their own office open xml standard , that would be tremendous . 
  the idea of docx as an open format is great , but microsoft seems to be doing anything to prolong their full control over docx . 
  also , i think that libreoffice would be sufficient for at least 80 % of people who use word , they usually write simple reports with minimal formatting , lo can handle this . 
  the ecosystem , which includes the driver support , is really important for the general public . 
  while they are not linux issues , they majorly contribute to the user experience , and users do n't really care what caused them . 
  when my scientific advisor gets a login loop after an update , he does n't care if it 's a problem caused by nvidia drivers , ubuntu maintainers , or anyone else . 
  as he does n't know how to use the command line or how to switch to a virtual console , his pc suddenly becomes completely unusable for him . 
  personally , i 'm dissatisfied with windows more than with linux . 
  and linux has gone a long way in the recent years to becoming more user-friendly . 
  but , in my experience , windows rarely has issues when something stops working or does n't work at all . 
  the difference for the user between popular distributions is mostly in looks , the available software is generally the same . 
  the weakest points of linux are probably gaming ( though valve contributes to its improvement ) and unavailability of specific professional software ( like photoshop ) with no alternatives . 
  `` free '' in `` free software '' is free as in speech , not free as in beer . 
  similarly , you can take any popular linux distro ( mint , ubuntu , fedora , etc ) for this case and get `` the biggest number '' . 
  two most prominent players on the mobile market ( ios and android ) have open-source kernels ( xnu and linux respectively ) . 
  android itself is mostly open-source , but with proprietary components . 
   open-source software is n't reliable there is a reason why linux distros are used on almost all servers . 
  i think that the linux kernel might be the most popular kernel worldwide , with its use on servers , android , and many smaller devices like routers . 
  as a linux user , i 'm still not convinced linux can replace windows for the general public , as i still bump into rather frustrating bugs and issues from time to time . 
  but i would support this movement nonetheless , more users will bring more incentives to improve it . 
  however , i think we definitely should at least do something about the monopoly of microsoft in the office software . 
  for such ubiquitous things as documents , open document format is a much better alternative than the proprietary docx . 
  while there is office open xml , microsoft is now very enthusiastic about supporting their own open format . 
  maybe some government-level pressure could make microsoft take action . 
   this sub isnt pro gay i do n't know , europeans in general and most visitors of this sub in particular seem rather gay-friendly . 
  saying that they are `` pro gay '' just because they do n't like muslims seems like violation of causality to me . 
  it sounds pretty gay if you place quotation marks around `` ride '' and `` bears '' . 
  grats to the ukrainians !, 
  i 'm a little bit envious . 
  getting visas is a pain in the ass . 
  the original phrase uses the word '' \u043f\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0441\u044b '' which is a derogatory word for gays ( and it is also obscene ) . 
  calling a person this word is a serious insult . 
  i think it might be worse than english `` faggot '' . 
  can confirm . 
  i often ride shirtless on a bicycle when it 's too hot . 
  thanks for the correction . 
  in my understanding of the federal list , every item on it is a description of a single entity which is rendered extremist as a whole . 
  but i 'm not a lawyer , so do n't cite me on this . 
  however , the list is filled in post factum , so , technically , items on it has always been illegal . 
  items on it are just * guaranteed * to be extremist as there already is a court decision for them , but courts can make new decisions anytime for anything else . 
  so i 'd probably better refrain from posting images of putin with makeup . 
  sure . 
  item 4071 on the federal list of extremist materials ( can be downloaded [ here ] ( http://minjust.ru/ru/node/243787 ) ) , my translation :  a poster depicting a man resembling the president of the russian federation v.v. 
  putin , on whose face there is makeup - painted eyelashes and lips , which , according to the author/authors of the poster , should serve as a hint of allegedly non-standard sexual orientation of the russian president . 
  the text under the image ( reproduced with preservation of features of spelling and punctuation , with hidden obscene vocabulary ) : `` putin 's voters are like ... there are seemingly many , but among my friends there are none '' , posted may 7 , 2014 in the social network `` vkontakte '' on the account * % invalid_account_link % * with the nickname `` alexander tsvetkov '' ( decision of the central district court of the city of tver on 11.05.2016 ) ;, 
  is it surprising ? 
  as far as i know , russia has never officially recognised that it was occupation . 
  most russians likely think the same . 
  i know several people who think that citizens of the baltic countries are just ungrateful bastards . 
  i do n't know why almost no media outlets mention the whole context . 
  as far as i understand , not the image itself was banned , but a combination of this image with the following text : `` putin voters are like faggots : there are seemingly many of them , but none among people i know '' . 
  the court decision was made in may 2016 , the list of banned materials was updated on march 30 . 
  they are very popular in the former soviet union . 
  unfortunately , some of them are badly maintained where i live . 
  i 've been to prague and t3s there are fantastic , they are able to accelerate to 60 kmh and be rather quiet and smooth . 
  here , they start moving , and you 'd better hold on to a handrail or you 'll fall . 
  the [ interior ] ( http://transphoto.ru/photo/03/91/51/391510.jpg ) is also dated . 
   though it 's ( very slowly ) changing is it a new trend for ukraine ? 
  in my city , roads are getting progressively worse and worse since 2014 . 
  non-citizens can legally stay using work visas , residence permits , refugee status , etc. 
   holy shit do all ukranians think like that ? 
  there is no need for such generalizations . 
  every nation has its good and bad people . 
  i remember 2014 and 2016 . 
  i might have missed something though . 
  i partly agree , as i feel somewhat responsible for what happens in ukraine ( as a citizen , but not personally responsible ) , but i have two objections . 
  first of all , not everyone voted for putin . 
  second , do not underestimate the power of state propaganda . 
  what you call `` voted '' is a little bit different in authoritarian states . 
  this is likely . 
  a lot of `` anti-terrorist '' legislation acts lead to limitations in liberties and the increase of the government 's control . 
  so far the retaliation always led to more power to the government . 
  fun fact : some opposition people ( e.g. , khodorkovsky ) think that yesterday 's protest was orchestrated by the government to hinder the protests . 
   investigated with a full international force i do n't really know how the international force can help in this case . 
  it 's not like quantity of investigators will increase the quality . 
  if there are traces leading outside russia ( though i doubt they can lead to the eu ) , the investigators will possibly ask for help . 
  i think it is much easier to say than to actually behave like that . 
  human mind and behavior can be very susceptible to emotions and instincts . 
  it 's probably hard to stay cool-headed and rational among continuous bombings . 
  yes . 
  i think they have gradually appeared in the recent 3-4 years . 
  metal detectors `` beep '' on almost every person ( e.g. , i have metal belt buckle and metal keys in by bag ) . 
  it 's just impossible to check everyone , crowds in metro are huge . 
  i 've been checked only twice in moscow when i ' a really large bag . 
  i think that metal detectors are rather useless for such large flows of people as in metro . 
  almost everyone carries something metal on them , it 's impossible to stop and check them all . 
  i have no idea , but it 's probably not a negligible amount of money .

  surname ` smirnov ' derived from the non-christian given name ` smirnoy ' which denotes a quiet and docile * child * , as opposed to a spoiled little brat . 
  being quiet was a notable character trait in the rural russia , where entire families had to live together , in one house . 
  just because you 're paranoid , it does n't mean they 're not out to get you . 
  someone ( belkovsky ? ), 
  once said that the dearest leader took the death of gaddafi with all seriousness . 
  he had been watching the video of the lynching again and again , for a long time . 
  quite sick stuff . 
  * there 's a lot of difference between listening and hearing . 
  * - g.k.chesterton . 
  he was re-elected into office before the euromaidan . 
  his grip on power had tightened before the euromaidan . 
  all that he got for the annexation of crimea was the surge in his approval rating . 
  was it worth it ? 
  it 's a normal practice , unless the inner circle is turned into echo chamber of his mind . 
  agreed . 
  this version makes much more sense . 
  i 'm goddamn sure he did n't . 
  he admitted to not using the internet . 
  the president is supposed to listen to daily reports provided by the press service . 
  or another ... hmmm ... service . 
   [ 2 ] putin 's desire to stay in power . 
  he had all means to stay in power as long as he pleases . 
  the next elections are in 2018 . 
  he is not worried about having voters in his pocket , as long as he has the electoral commission and parliament under the thumb instead . 
  the opposition is chased under the bed . 
  i mean , wtf ? 
  \\  implying that he ever had a chance for listening to this song . 
   the country is in such deep hole , that without external enemies and expansion it would get eaten from the inside by its own issues . 
  before the ukrainian shenanigans , russia was in a better shape than ever . 
  there must be another reason for him doing what he did . 
  suppression of national culture ? 
  facing a backlash as a result ? 
  that 's something unheard of / s, 
  hmm , apparently it is , just came to mind . 
  a peace that can be broken by a man with a handgun is not worth a bloody dime . 
  man , it 's inevitable . 
  they have to either tighten the grip on the people or risk the country falling apart . 
  i only hope that the eu will whip the gov ' t ass in case they go too far . 
  i do n't think this government is inherently bad . 
  just as populistic as many before them . 
  sanctions may be lifted once crimea is handed back to ukraine . 
  this is not gon na happen unless the rufed , as we know it today , is dismantled completely . 
  in that case , the western sanctions will be the last thing to bother about . 
  not only in russia , though . 
  this negative attitude has been around for a long time and expecting that it may be changed overnight is unrealistic , to say the least . 
  what i disagree with is that op omitted the word ` statutory ' . 
  op should have clarified that then and made it more clear . 
  i mean , as far as i understand , those are * different * crimes in the us penal code . 
  do you mean that having consensual sex with an underage girl is a rape nonetheless ? 
  a quote from the wiki article :  as a result of the plea bargain , polanski pleaded guilty to the charge of `` unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor , '' [ 114 ] [ 115 ] and was ordered to undergo 90 days of psychiatric evaluation at california institution for men at chino . 
  [ 116 ] therefore , he 's never been convicted for a * rape * . 
  never thought of reading the article before posting , op ? 
  would be nice though . 
  that said , the money saved will most likely be spent on the ongoing rearmament programme . 
  therefore , it wo n't make any difference for the common people . 
  your point being ? 
  despite being a neighboring country , estonia still draws less attention than latvia , lithuania or finland , to name a few . 
  that contradicts with your initial statement . 
  case closed . 
  congrats , you 've just come up with a new unit of measurement . 
  not so funny as micro-hitlers though . 
  try ' \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430 ' or ' \u041b\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f ' , estonia will get less hits anyway . 
  population size is not so relevant in that regard . 
  with ten times the population , china makes less headlines than russia does . 
  wtf is the method ? 
  rg.ru , seriously ?

  no need to make up numbers . 
  estonia is barely even mentioned in the rufed media . 
   why russia has such a problem with estonia are you sure what they * have * the problem ? 
  the illarionov 's opinion should be taken with a pinch of salt . 
  why should they do that ? 
  there 's nothing wrong with the chip . 
  above all , meduza is a niche product ; there are plenty other websites spreading the good news about the motherland . 
  although they may be too loud sometimes , i have a favorable view of the armenian people . 
  ca n't explain why , perhaps , they are simply awesome , haha , and their cuisine is delicious . 
  no , it 's just kzakhar is not worth engaging in a serious conversation . 
  xe 's just repeating the same thing in different ways . 
  the most explosive tensions seem to occur between the slavic population and muslims from north caucasus or the former soviet republics . 
  kazakhs and tatars are fine , though . 
  armenians are my personal favorites from all of the foreign nationals , haha . 
  actually , it 's impossible to single out a certain ethnicity that is hated by everybody here . 
  at ease , private !, 
  zombie stalin did it . 
  color me surprised . 
  right sector openly made threats to beat the shit out of the lgbt activists .

  recently added topics : america is out to get us / ukrainian fascists are eating babies, 
  1 ) the level of abstraction usually decreases from left to right , i.e. , megacategory -  category -  subcategory -  item . 
  i mean , placing the category 's color brick to the right of the title is weird , to say the least . 
  2 ) too much empty space between titles and categories . 
  i mean , our eyes can not move straight from side to side without little santa helpers . 
  that 's why we use horizontal and vertical lines in tables etc. 
  the existing lines are too pale to follow . 
  i had to struggle every time trying to catch a link between the title and the respective color brick . 
  edit : last but not least . 
  the colors of rectangles would be much less saturated .

  : regardless of putin himself , the map seems to be a map of stereotypes about how he sees that countries, 
  saint pete is fond of you then because russian government claims that moscow is the capital of russia ... ( sorry ),

  now it 's your turn :3, 
  sky news shitpost about russia aswell, 
  a bunch of cherrypicked facts ofc , they forgot to mention that : * women got pension 5 years before men ( f 55 / m 60 years ) * they are not conscripted to army * they have to be paid their avg . 
  salary for 2 months before and 2 months after the birth of the child , and 40 % of salary for 1.5 years of maternity care ( if they want ) - tho maybe i mixed some numbers here * perhaps something else, 
  thanks , fixed, 
  i would n't believe sky after their story about romanians selling weapons tho i guess you mean this article ( http://news.sky.com/story/revealed-russias-secret-syria-mercenaries-10529248 ) that claims that according to some guy `` approximately 500 to 600 people have died there '' . 
  sounds fishy , does n't it ? 
  edit : fishily -  fishy, 
  in russia it is forbidden to sell alcohol in retail at nights ( 23:00 - 8:00 ) , but some regions have stricter rules ( e.g.

   it 's just really sad how all the soviet accomplishments are immediately associated with russia . 
  yeah , as well as all soviet fuck-ups / wrongdoings, 
  rkn is known for their bad memeing . 
  btw if somebody interested pornhub.ru mirror works fine, 
  you are mixing two different meanings together , in this context it is safe as in `` sfw '', 
  yes it has shit ton of porn of every category given that there is english interface available , all you need is to register and uncheck `` safe search '' when making queries also there are many videos that can be found only by joining special private groups ( usually one enters easy without being asked anything ),

  afaik it 's original story ;-(, 
  yeah , i hope they wo n't fuck this up ( the director has bad reputation here ) tho , this movie has a budgete of ~ 5 mln $ - almost nothing compared to marvel/etc,

  `` she lives in piter and knows the auditory '' * everything related to the anniversary ends on the 11th of september so far it seems trustworthy to me because kommersant checks facts ( well at least i have n't encounter vice versa ), 
  `` putin critic '' is op 's commentary , not source 's words ( not covered by the article at all ) well this sounds formal but imo * ordnung muss sein *, 
  yeah i have just googled his words . 
  also for those who are interested in what he exactly was saying there 're his facebook and [ the website he was the editor of ] ( http://nr2.com.ua/ ) btw found one interesting enough [ quote ] ( http://nr2.com.ua/news/politics_and_society/shchetinin-priezzhiy-iz-rossii-protivnik-putina-eto-eshche-ne-storonnik-ukrainy-video-103818.html ) that tens of millions of russian refugees could overflow ukraine in the future, 
  it does n't change this fact but it does break / r/europe 's rule :  editorialised titles - do not add your opinion/commentary to the article 's title . 
  do n't add something that is n't covered by the article , and do n't misrepresent the article . 
  adding a sentence verbatim from within the 1st paragraph or byline that is more representative of the content is generally ok but only where it improves clarity . 
   russian journalists committing `` suicide '' . 
  in this particular case it is what ukrainian source ( unian ) claim, 
  why editorializing the title tho ? 
  there 're no occurences of both `` putin '' and `` critic '' in the article edit : or at least it ` ld be nice to give some context for those who are unaware of his relations w / putin also for those who not gon na read it :  russian journalist alexander shchetinin , who was living in kyiv , has been found dead in his flat  the portal reported that alexander had suffered a gunshot wound to his head , and a gun was found underneath his chair . 
  sources allege that the case is being investigated as a suicide , as the journalist had reportedly sent an email to a relative saying he had planned to commit suicide . 
   alexander shchetinin is the founder of the novy region ( new region ) news agency , which split into the ural and ukrainian editorial offices in 2014 . 
  the journalist gave up his russian citizenship and became a ukrainian citizen , taking up residence in kyiv . 
   what they call the great patriotic war btw literal translation is `` great war for the fatherland '' if somebody interested, 
   are you afraid about growing power of putin ? 
  well , he has already been the most powerful man here for a decade  do you feel like the country could turn into some form of totalitarian regime ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  for me as a regular citizen almost nothing ( except bad economical situation now ) has changed since 2009 or smth ( ca n't recall what was before it ) if i considered emigration , it ` ld be mostly because of economical reasons . 
  i posted it there - https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4z7ogw/russia_results_of_the_poll_about_trust_in_mass/ i do n't know anything about state of these archives . 
  but i was born in komi republic ( there were lots of gulags in stalin times ) and i know that their history is greatly documented . 
  for example `` pokayanie '' fund published a passional on it consisting of like 20 books ( interesting read - personal stories , memories , statistics and lists of prisoners and so on , but unfortunately available only in russian ) with partial support of komi government . 
  i ` ld say that the problem in this case is that general population is not interested in history , etc. 
  edit : thanks for the gold, 
  interesting , til . 
  though i do n't think it happens here ( at least , to such extent ) . 
  we had federal census in 2010 and ~ 20 % said they are not of russian nationality ( and totally about 100 nationalites were mentioned - http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/perepis2010/croc/documents/vol4/pub-04-01.pdf ) i understand that romanian/russian thing is political tho even given that transnistria is supported by russia , situation inside it is much worse than here, 
  can you say something on topic and not just shitpost ? 
   could be interpreted as lack of patriotism or even treason . 
  what edit : i mean , elaborate please, 
  levada center is not a governmental organization tho, 
  / shrugs and what was the point of fabricating these results ( of this certain poll ) ? 
  the source is a pdf ( http://www.levada.ru/cp/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/doverie_tablitsy.pdf ) from this levada poll - http://www.levada.ru/2016/08/12/14111/ unfortunately i had n't found english version so translated it myself the poll was done in this jule among 1600 participants from different places of russia, 
   closing archives about gulags you probably mean the museum in perm . 
  idk , why was it closed but it was a single case afaik . 
  for example , there 's a working state museum of gulag in moscow - http://www.gmig.ru/o-muzee  is this really true ? 
  from my personal experience - yes . 
  there 's a poll pretty much relevant to your question - http://www.levada.ru/cp/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/doverie_tablitsy.pdf . 
  unfortunately it 's not avaliable in english version so i translated it - http://imgur.com/a/hjw76 ( i should probably post it as another post ) for example it has questions like `` what sources of information do you most trust about news in the country and worldwide ? 
  '' , `` do you trust the information about events in the country , that is distributed by main tv channels ? 
  '' , `` in your opinion , on what topic of society life tv presents most objective information ? 
  '' , `` in your opinion , do country leadership , highest officials always say truth speaking of the situation of economics , public healthcare , pensions , fight against crime and other primary spheres of management ? '',

  why do you think it was because of russia ? 
   well because moldova was until 1918 part of the russian empire ... finland and baltics too . 
  yeah but they think they would live like western europeans which is wrong , they would live like modern greeks or portuguese, 
  well , some parts of romania had 20-30 % literacy rate in 1930 . 
  it 's lower than literacy in estonia in 1897 during russian empire . 
  it 's a mistake to think that romania ( and other eastern european countries ) , is poorer than western european countries only because of communism . 
  although many romanians probably think like that ... 
  zhirinovsky and zuganov are too old , to make elections less boring they let this man run for president . 
  you know who will win anyway . 
  exactly !, 
  the best example is when he described the collapse of the soviet union as `` the greatest geopolitical catastrophe '' of the 20th century . 
  but nobody says about the second part where he mentions that break-up of the ussr in 1991 was `` a real drama '' ** which left tens of millions of russians outside the russian federation ** . 
  they found themselves in new nationalist states . 
  kazakhstan , baltics , uzbekistan , turkmenistan they all became nationalist . 
  for fuck 's sake how this is not a tragedy ?!, 
  i partly condemn collapse of the su in the way we have seen in 1991 ** only ** because of this thing . 
  it should 've collapsed more peaceful and mild way . 
  when poles , romanians and balts glorify it , they care about their national interests . 
  `` who the fuck cares about local small genocides ? 
  hooray !, 
  we 're free yay !!! '', 
  well , for a minute think about ** my ** national interest . 
  `` titushki '' are paid sportsmen and `` chavs '' used to suppress pro-european protesters . 
  `` plan shatun '' is an alleged plan of vladislav surkov , putin 's aide , to destabilize ukraine by protests , according to his leaked e-mail . 
  yanukovich was a normal ukrainian nationalist , he ukrainized ukrainian schools , sucked money from russia , almost stopped conscription , slmost signed agreement with eu . 
  he successfully balanced between eu and russia . 
  and corruption ... all of their presidents were and will be corrupted . 
  just like in russia bc thats the mentality of our people, 
   brainwashed putinbots you mean . 
  putinbots are everywhere  russians are to blame for communism , russians alone !, 
  no , we are victims of communism, 
   and who the heck keeps upvoting you ? 
  thinking people with knowledge of history . 
   that was you , dear russian . 
  that was all you !, 
  lies, 
  and why they live worse than us now ? 
  are we still robbing them ? 
  i wonder how, 
  we did n't . 
  we fought against bolshevik scum and you helped bolshevik scum , along with hot latvian boys . 
  we are victims of communism . 
   you still control areas that are not indigenous russian areas . 
  oh , what a fucking russian occupant , he does n't want his country to collapse . 
  i 'm soooooooooo bad if i do n't want it . 
  i 'm soooooo bad i do n't want to ruin achievements of our ancestors . 
  have you asked them ? 
  do they want to become completely independent ? 
  maybe , not all of them are separatists , maybe they have relatives in moscow or saint-petersburg , maybe they work on factories and sell production to various russian regions without barriers ? 
  have you thought about this ? 
   and continue to russify these people ... 
  they russify themselves because their nations are very small and they do n't have much content in native languages . 
  you will never find harry potter or a game of thrones translated into kalmyk language because nobody will do it and nobody will buy such book . 
  we do n't have to do anything , my friend , because our russian sphere is 100x , 500x , 200x bigger then theirs , there are tons of various websites , tv shows , movies , books , games on russian and almost zero in their languages . 
  just few days ago on youtube on trainfever russian stream i saw a conversation between ukrainian schoolboy and other guy , ukrainian apologized for bad knowledge of russian and said he speaks ukrainian at home and in his school they teach polish instead of russian . 
  but he chose to come to russian stream anyway , ** i wonder why ** ? 
  russians suffered from ussr as much as other nations , you will not make me think i am guilty . 
   people were killed and sent to siberia because they dared speak their own language any proof ? 
  nobody banned or suppressed their culture and languages, 
   mari language as a state language is studied in 154 schools . 
  course `` history and culture of the peoples republic of mari el '' is conducted in 353 schools . 
  thus , the study of native and mari state languages covering more than 80 percent of the students 1-9-graders and nearly all the children of mari nationality . 
  the study of the mari language is included in the curriculum , there are n't any talks about elective study of it . 
  we have different sources . 
  are they our colonies ? 
  wow, 
  who is controlling moldova , ukraine and georgia ? 
  who is their master ? 
   elective courses no , it 's obligated . 
  there is already independent baltics , belarus , moldova , ukraine , what else do you need ? 
  you 're very spoiled, 
  they ca n't resist influence of 300x times bigger russian sphere . 
  they marry russians , they go study in moscow and other cities , they move to other cities . 
  mixed children forget mari culture etc. 
   do maris have their schools in mari language ? 
  they have classes with mari language , i do n't know about schools . 
  ~ 40 % of schoolchildren study mari language there . 
  their language is official in mari el republic even though only 42 % of population call themselves mari . 
  looking at 95 % russian speaking narva with estonian official language , you do n't have a right to teach us . 
   you assume that we would say something in a `` conversation yes . 
  something totally non politically correct about the 1/3 of your country . 
  what can that be ? 
  in '90s they loved as so much huh it 's not like we 're better now but this sympathy to alcoholic president was so disgusting . 
  but they obey, 
  you just have to stop oppressing them and be friendly i do n't want russia to invade estonia, 
   however if they are being persecuted by what claims to be a civilized country agree , estonian crimes against russian minority must be investigated, 
  yeah it 's like that . 
  if you obey you 'll be ok . 
  if you do n't , you 're separatist and will be persecuted . 
   because russia does n't a good relationship with protecting non russian minorities they 're good there as long as they do n't oppose annexation . 
  our anti-communists died in civil war . 
  our peasants protested and were killed with chemical weapons . 
  but you portray it as if there was n't any resistance, 
  it was nicer when your country did n't support white army and sent estonian red riflemen terrorists to russia . 
  why they hell you complain if your country helped this communist monster come to power . 
  at first he killed our national elite . 
  then he killed our peasants and ordinary people . 
  then he devoured delicious untouched eastern europe . 
  communist poland is your fault mostly , your people chose to not fight back . 
  i do n't believe in western media .

during the 90s , they were actually de-facto and on a weird de-jure independent until the deal happened, 
  i honestly am not big on specifics , but i 'll describe the history . 
  in order to persuade tatarstan to stay in russia , yeltsin gave them very nice economic and administrative perks , in the sense that they are able to have greater control over their republic . 
  a good symbol of this independence is their own state oil company tatneft . 
  in fact if you ever visit kazan , you will feel you almost entered a different country . 
  tatar 's advantageous position in russia has even made them able to present their own history during the universiade , along with some russian history, 
  this was under bush , the ` reset ' would only happen under obama in ' 09 . 
  the war was ' 08 . 
  the report said that georgia was the one that invaded south ossetia , european countries mostly just did not bring it up . 
  us still officially supports georgia as a victim of agression , even though it started the hostilities, 
  tatarstan actually wields special status in russia , even above the other republics . 
  tatarstan 's relatively high autonomy stems from tatarstan 's special status in the constitution, 
  i 'm surprised shilling accusations are n't banned here , people just keep using it to try and shut people up . 
  [ seriously ] ( https://img.4plebs.org/boards/x/image/1397/25/1397259718863.png ), 
  yes, 
  something very unsettling about that guy 's look, 
  awesome anthem with an interesting history , considering the words were changed like 3 times already . 
  ah i see , thanks !, 
  ok , in russian pozvonit is to call , pozvoniti is for plural or formal to call , essentially the same since slavs . 
  prozvonit ( there 's an r ) does n't mean to just call , it means to call with the intention of leaving a missed call so the person being called can call back, 
  not pozvonit , prozvonit, 
  talking shit about a sub you obviously have n't even read , stay classy, 
  destabilization was maidan 's part . 
  ukraine has dismal conditions , but there was stability . 
  here 's to a brighter future ... 
  i think right now it 's really the heat of the moment . 
  nobody really expected shit to go down like it did in ukraine , and putin made some quick and decisive , albeit scary for europe maneuvers . 
  things will calm down eventually , but right now thanks to maidan there is huge destabilization in ukraine , and we ca n't just ignore it . 
  i have seen your other comments on infrastructure problems , and i agree with you . 
  but unfortunately we ca n't just drop everything and focus on one problem , because there is a lot to deal with . 
  things have gotten better , and should keep improving , but it 's a tricky business, 
  i 'm not saying they 're only nationalists , but nationalists are most definitely in the opposition . 
  and the government has no ideology , but knows pretty well that it 's in russia 's interests to not stoke ethnic tensions . 
  also at least they got something anyway , regional elections are back ( despite what people say about their legitimacy , etc ), 
  you 're joking , right ? 
  moscow liberals were at bolotnaya with nationalists . 
  navalny is someone who is a nationalist . 
  do you really think that a political force that consists of a tuvan mod , a mansi mayor of moscow , and a former tatar moi is going to be embracing the rise of russian nationalism ? 
  if anything , the government is trying to contain it as much as it can . 
  i do n't get it , i thought this sub dislikes nationalists ? 
  that 's pretty sad , maybe you should read a book, 
  you 're joking right ? 
  when was the embassy made ? 
  size of the embassy usually corresponds to its political importance . 
  [ our embassy in washington is pretty imposing as well ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/russian_embassy_us.jpg ), 
  his flair on/r/russia was canadian so that was probably true . 
  we banned him after it turned out he was making harassing messages to others, 
  because i do n't like it when people try to stalk my habits, 
  was n't ceausescu pretty independent from the kremlin ? 
  what i read was that he was fine till the 80s, 
  it was depopulated of russians if anything, 
  why do n't mods just ban him for shitposting ? 
  there are actual russians that could be decently debated with , and i do n't see why you even need to see poor quality posts other than to have a lightning rod to bash russia, 
  among ministers it 's almost always rogozin , in the duma it 's almost always zhirinovsky, 
  it 's only one official that does it , calm down, 
  just because western europe wants to tarnish relations with russia does n't mean everyone wants to . 
  it 's bulgaria 's and serbia 's choice as a sovereign state to conduct foreign affairs as it pleases, 
  roma and florence , gon na hit up some museums, 
  it 's all good , yes you are thinking of bashkirs . 
  as long as people learn more , that 's all that matters, 
  well gorbachev is not really reflective of the soviet union . 
  most of us see him as a traitor , considering the mess he allowed to happen, 
  buryats are mongol people living in southeast russia in buryatia , which borders on mongolia . 
  they are buddhist , while tatars are muslm . 
  they to share some common traits due to the mongol invasion of rus , but all in all they are separate peoples, 
  it means there is tension between russians and the other 20 % . 
  just because there is n't a lot of them does n't mean there ca n't be tension, 
  what do you mean by buryats ? 
  tatars ad buryats are different people, 
  most people make connotations between 1984 and the soviet union , when it was meant for all nations really, 
  do n't forget austria , the anti-germany !, 
  it 's always strange seeing mentions of russian and mongolian neo-nazis , considering they were supposed to be exterminated by the nazis . 
  how do you justify yourself agreeing with hitler like that ? 
  will check it out thanks !, 
  i have kubuntu , it 's just a short class on terminal commands which would be pretty useful to have a crash course on, 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm planning on taking the free linux course they have, 
  seeing as it 's a new development , can someone who 's taken the courses explain how it works ? 
  do read lectures online and take a test ? 
  your borscht is slightly different than our borscht !, 
  stay strong , serb brothers !, 
  they do in fact !, 
  it helps that they too are their own republic within russia , and they have festivals such as [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yhyakh ) , and traditional culture is preserved as you can see [ here ] ( http://rbth.com/multimedia/pictures/2013/12/24/a_winter_beauty_in_the_coldest_place_on_earth_32523.html ), 
  well yakuts and siberians live in their homeland , siberia . 
  you have cities in siberia with russians and other groups living normally , populations of these cities is small but is growing, 
  well republics in russia have more autonomy than oblasts , as they are based on the predominant ethnic minority in the region . 
  tatarstan is very autonomous because of its special status , but so is chechnya in a way , considering how kadyrov 's style of rule would not be tolerated in some oblast . 
  for the rest of the republics , it 's a formality , but languages get special status so there is some difference, 
  that 's kind of how moscow survived, 
  not second biggest , the biggest, 
  well we did send them an [ ilyushin full of supplies and personel ] ( http://en.itar-tass.com/world/732040 ), 
  with the exception of i and a couple more , very similar, 
  it 's like football vs soccer in terms of the divide between chai and te, 
  vice news is better , but the whole informality has negatives along with positives, 
  vladivostok 's russkiy is is supposed to be one , but i 've never been, 
  well that 's the thing about mgimo , because it 's a school of international relations , it is connected to both business and politics . 
  on one hand it 's a shady figure on another its a business major or even someone like lavrov . 
  it 's a useful vehicle , but it is n't inherently shady, 
  i mean carl bildt, 
  guatemala or honduras , coup happened within the last decade , clinton apparently involved,

  why ? 
  well we do realize that . 
  i do . 
  my grandma does . 
  i think even my neighbor 's ugly dog knows that . 
  the thing is , most people are pretty content with the rights they have and your advice does n't make much sense [ to us around these parts ] . 
  what rights , precisely , are we lacking ? 
  we can move around . 
  own stuff . 
  do business , whatever . 
  for most russians it 's okay and they do n't see any more rights that need acquiring . 
  what we want is to do business easier . 
  what we want is less bureaucracy . 
  what we want is better funded police that does n't have to resort to bribes . 
  what we want is a more professional medical staff at our gloriously free hospitals . 
  higher pensions . 
  higher salaries . 
  this is seen as urgent , everything else seems irrelevant . 
  corruption on the lower levels is somewhat institutionalized because that 's how you grab your police force by the balls . 
  you let them do corrupt things to feed themselves and that gives you leverage over them , because if they do n't do stuff that you want to be done , you can throw them into prison on the basis of corruption charges . 
  easy . 
  and that gives you power over the masses . 
  that 's what you do with lower-ranking officials to keep your hold on everything . 
  most people do n't care about free assembly because they are well-fed , clothed , entertained and content . 
  most people do n't want to be able to own fire arms because duh , what are they , criminals ? 
  most people do n't care about gay rights because it 's something out of movies . 
  you see ? 
  apathy . 
  apathy fostered by the turbulent 90-ies . 
  90-ies during which `` democracy '' and `` liberal '' became curse words here . 
  and then some guy comes to power and brings stability . 
  no more soldiers panhandling on the streets . 
  no more red-jacket wearing new russians doing mafia shoot-outs at nights . 
  guess why people like this new found stability more than some fairy-tale bullshit that did n't work out for them . 
  guess why the iron hand scored more than rambling alcoholic who let us bark but took away our food . 
  that 's why they are happy with how things are and all they want is more rubles and not rights , because they have just enough . 
  when i look deep inside my soul all i see there is my racked up credit card debt and mortgage and not a proposition for a revolutionary bill of rights that will somehow turn russia into large norway or a slightly angrier canada . 
  and this goes for many of us . 
  we are n't starving . 
  we are n't being forced into some stupid ideology . 
  we 're content with the status quo . 
  i , personally , do n't want to have another putsch or revolution or whatever because it sucks . 
  it sucks immensely living through a revolution . 
  i 'm all for gradual changes and growth , for evolution , for progress . 
  the people in power will die out . 
  people who were exposed to another way of thinking will take their place . 
  our constitution is okay , our laws are mostly okay , the problem is that the officials are corrupt as hell , on every level , and the rule of law is n't observed . 
  the legal framework was always there , what we traditionally lack is good management . 
  maybe we should be a little less cynical , as a society . 
  but this is something that does n't grow overnight . 
  yeah . 
  every time i see `` fuck russia '' , `` fuck russians '' , `` let 's nuke them fuckers '' all i want to say is `` fuck you too , random internet person '' , but then i remember that y' all guys are upset with our government 's policies and not me personally . 
  i kinda am , but mostly for my income and my overall quality of life . 
  is there a link to the poll ? 
  it 's also being somewhat fueled by the sensation of being ostracized on the global arena , being excluded , unwanted , uninvited . 
  surely it 's a two-way road and a subject for pondering . 
  this is true to some extent since the country lost its ideology and nothing really filled in the vacuum in people 's hearts and minds . 
  it 's an identity crisis of sorts . 
  we 'll have problems , you 'll have mild annoyances . 
  one man 's coward is other man 's trading partner . 
  well that 's what belarus ( belorussia = belaya rus ' = white russia ) means . 
  borjomi has that weird taste . 
  i 'll stick to perrier like my fabulous lithuanian friend here . 
  i am actually amused by their butt-hurt . 
  their anger gives me sustenance . 
  `` berkut '' is the ukrainian special police force , akin to the russian `` omon '' . 
  the word `` berkut '' itself describes a bird of prey , a golden eagle . 
  i 'd say a hawk , but google translate tells me otherwise . 
  and then the usa sends a strongly-worded letter of disapproval . 
  russia feels sorry for its actions and goes into the corner , thinking about how badly it behaved . 
  yes !, 
  a thousand times yes . 
  screw paying import taxes . 
  also non-cyrillic using guys ca n't spell \u0449\u0438 ( `` szchee , shi , shee , schi '' ) . 
  it 's adorable . 
  like looking at a baby horse trying to stand on its feet for the first time . 
  like , the whole population of cis countries , judging by the amount of both legal and illegal immigrants . 
  i wish no one would want to live here , there 'd be no traffic jams and i 'd be able to find a seat in the metro during rush hours . 
  there 's no cold weather , only inability to dress properly . 
  it kinda is . 
  some posters do not refrain from using blatantly russophobic rhetoric . 
  most discussions devolve into circle-jerks . 
  goddamit hollywood , get it together , we 're , like , treating all the movies that are being released as documentaries and instruction manuals . 
  especially `` independence day '' . 
  if aliens invade , destroy their fleet using jeff goldblum . 
  it 's a contributing factor for sure . 
  i 'm just being somewhat sarcastic . 
  it 's kinda expected now , you 're right . 
  everybody here understands the basics of real estate dynamics and how it correlates with your income , especially if you 're in a field that is n't desired by the market . 
  thanks for info on the `` boomerang generation '' . 
  as a muscovite , i never was sent away to receive my higher education since most of the universities are concentrated right here . 
  i 'm kinda fond of the way how you guys do it across the pond with student campuses and such - i bet it 's a great time in life when you can spend your academic years with your peers . 
  well at least it 's fun according to the movies . 
  i ca n't even think of having more than two children , even with the whole maternity capital thing . 
  if they would pay off like at least 50 % of my debt i 'd go make someone pregnant like in 20 minutes . 
  but for now , the very thought of living with kids in a cramped little man-cave makes me shiver . 
  absolutely . 
  also i 'd like to see more comments regarding whether it 's a cultural norm or more of a thing brought by the shifts in the economy . 
  i heard our american friends are experiencing a bit of a culture shock due to the shaky employment market and sky-high rent that do not enable them to move out from their parents ' houses . 
  also probably student debt factors in , i kinda get upset when i hear stories about people racking up 40,000 + usd in college education debt .

  except they do . 
  there are * dozens * of reports on bombed city blocks when there were no any separatists nearby . 
  lisichansk oil refinery [ was attacked recently ] ( http://itar-tass.com/ekonomika/1328434 ) for completely unknown reason , that 's one place were separatists have absolutely no reason to be . 
   terrorists commanders are chechen wars veterans . 
  please share the source . 
   and who said something else ? 
  [ in supporting putin now they are guilty of each and every murder . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2b5rj2/there_is_no_sign_of_shock_or_shame_in_russia_anne/cj2818r ) in this very thread . 
   usa so how those drone strikes are going , mate ? 
  there are some countries in the world that could lecture russia about having good values . 
  usa is not one of them . 
  brace yourself for downvotes , mate . 
  that 's whataboutism and you know it . 
  let me give you an example . 
  imagine civilian building . 
  typical soviet-build nine-story concrete monster with two hundred apartments and about half a thousand civilians living here . 
  police gets info that may be there is a meth lab in one of those apartments . 
  by your logic , police can just bomb the hell out of this building killing all civilians in the process , and it would be drug makers responsible for that because they did n't move out of this building . 
  let me clarify . 
  there are hundreds of destroyed civilian buildings with several dozens ( if not hundreds ) civilians dead . 
  is there one example that says , basically , ` this building got destroyed and those civilians were killed because armed terrorists hid there ' ? 
   there was an article not long ago posted in here about rebels setting up their artillery in church courtyard . 
  a link would be nice . 
  anyways , that 's not an answer to my question . 
  let me clarify . 
  there are hundreds of destroyed civilian buildings with several dozens ( if not hundreds ) civilians dead . 
  is there one example that says , basically , ` this building got destroyed and those civilians were killed because armed terrorists hid there ' ? 
   the civilian casualties are unfortunately inevitable as the terrorists wo n't stop using the advantage of settlements as human shields on their own . 
  i wonder , is there one example of east ukrainian separatists actually using civilians as a human shield ? 
  i mean , like ` this civilian building was destroyed because there were separatists in there ' . 
   have you even read it ? 
  actually , i did . 
   it contains an extremely vague definition of the actual offense bullshit . 
  that 's quite specific . 
  so no , you ca n't just jail any gay for being gay . 
  but you can be fined even if you are not gay . 
  thing is , this law has nothing to do with * being * gay - quite contrary to lies spread by nyt . 
  so much for checking their sources . 
  this law is not anti-gay , it is aimed at shit like [ this ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/15/russian-children-coloring-book_n_4282899.html ) . 
   furthermore you can get remain in jail pending your verdict no , you ca n't . 
  administrative detainment can be applied , but it ca n't last past 3 hours . 
   thirdly the the fines are n't $ 50 , usually $ 200 and can go up to $ 12,000 . 
  yes , my wrong , it 's not $ 50 , but up to $ 150 ( at a current exchange rate ) . 
  not much a difference , anyway . 
  higher fines are reserved for officials ( up to $ 1500 ) and organizations ( up to $ 30000 ) . 
  except [ they did n't ] ( https://twitter.com/osce_smm/status/490187980305616896 ) . 
  did you even read that law ? 
  first , it has nothing to do with you being gay . 
  it is about what you say and to whom you say it . 
  second , and most important , the jail is out of question . 
  it is * administrative * law , not criminal . 
  you can be fined for about $ 50 , that 's all . 
   it 's the new york fucking times . 
  i think they 've been around long enough to check their sources . 
  you mean like that time when they released an article on new russian ` anti-gay ' law in which they tell us that you can be now put to jail in russia just for being gay ? 
  well , wwii turned out to be a pretty good business for usa . 
  also , ukraine being a battleground would n't actually hurt poroshenko or other ukrainian oligarchs . 
   but that 's very unlikely . 
  why not ? 
  kiev government had no problem whatsoever with attacking civilian targets . 
  this tragedy is very , very convenient for kiev . 
   brought to justice and jailed you mean like it was done in [ 2001 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siberia_airlines_flight_1812#alleged_missile_accident ) by ukraine or in [ 1988 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran_air_flight_655#medals_awarded ) by usa ? 
  oh wait , it was n't . 
  wrong . 
  it would ruin russian industry which still ca n't compete with eu 's without government help . 
  it was actually 300 millions . 
   it also is governed by south ossetians , who might ethnically be russians just to be precise , south ossetians are ethnically ossetian , a small iranian-related ethnicity . 
  ossetia is divided by mountains to north ossetia ( which is part of russian federation , so citizens of north ossetia are also citizens of r.f. ), 
  and south ossetia , which is considered by georgia as georgian ( ossetians themselves have a different opinion on that , and tried to get their independence since ussr went apart ) . 
   i did n't say it is . 
  i said it might as well be what 's your point , exactly ? 
   yeah some very nice peacekeepers are those . 
  constant shellings from right near them . 
  source ? 
   it 's such a weird thing when your country ca n't stop shellings from the territory they 're guarding but they can go a few miles further with its army a and kick the georgian army around do n't you think . 
  nothing weird about it : peacekeeping mission is one thing , full-fledged military operation is completely another . 
   does it suggest that it 's part of russia ? 
  did i missed something , and russia already annexed south ossetia ? 
  anyways , no sane country wants a hot spot on its borders , especially when people of the same ethnicity live in said country just across a mountain . 
  hence russian peacekeepers , and russian reactions after those peacekeepers where shelled by georgia . 
   what was so troubling about letting chechnya go back in the day ? 
  chechnya was independent , for some time ( de-facto independent , at least ) . 
  then they started to make business out of kidnapping and slave trade . 
  even that was tolerated for some time , but then they decided to attack russia . 
   ethnic cleansing of georgians ** from russia ** vityok is most probably talking about thousands of illegal georgian immigrands who were forced to go home shortly after the events of 2008 . 
  this was labeled as ` ethnical cleansing ' by some . 
  also , south ossetia is n't exactly georgian soil . 
  the name kind of suggests it . 
   ethnic cleansing of georgians from russia so sending out illegal immigrants is now ` ethnic cleansing ' . 
  careful there , propaganda of this intensity is very unhealthy . 
  it would be very nice of you to provide some proof to your words . 
  last time i checked , russian reporters were using armor with fucking big ` press ' on it . 
  oh really ? 
  i assume you have some proof to that ? 
  south ossetia is south ossetia , so it is quite possible for georgia to assault it . 
  transfer of russian army was justified by said assault . 
  georgia assaulted south ossetia , not russia . 
  are you high or what ? 
  you 're not very good at evading questions , you know ? 
  so shelling cities with grad is n't starting the war ?

  rip . 
  lol no it does n't , you 're making shit up now . 
  here 's the next one : http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/296416 you can see the direction that shells came from . 
  uk anti porn law working as intended . 
  [ there is someone who will protect cattle minorities !, 
  ] ( https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/ob-ul410_0906pu_j_20120906053804.jpg ), 
  the rich get richer !, 
  we 're living it !, 
  do n't forget the rebels offing each other in idlib , showing their true psychopathic colours . 
  kuznetsov was mainly sent to syria as a training exercise , but it was a part of a deployment which made history !, 
  ooooh , subbed , thanks !, 
  i 'm actually a lizard . 
  i 'm not criticising them though . 
  pretty interesting stuff . 
  what an age to be alive , when ordinary people can use a tool like the internet to influence opinions , all sorts of anonymous online communities etc. 
  this would have sounded like sci fi 20 years ago , but here we are . 
  that being said , i doubt le pen can beat fillon . 
  fn are a real life version of the sith . 
  there will always be one master and one apprentice . 
  when marine took marion as an apprentice , she destroyed her master , jean-marie . 
  hope that helps . 
  russians . 
  that 's really interesting , our parents/grandparents sure had it tougher than us . 
  my grandma had an electric stove actually when i was a kid , not sure why , but the hotplates were actually metal . 
  i remember always having to watch out for the hotplates to cool before you can touch them , not that i did much cooking back then lol . 
  well , i had the option of electric or gas and i went with gas , because it 's significantly cheaper , and i prefer to cook on gas for some reason . 
  my auntie has an electric stove though and she loves it , it 's easier to clean as well . 
  i assume you have an electric stove ? 
  many residences have a [ gas stove ] ( https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/brand-new-gas-stove-never-used-stainless-tray-appliance-retail-store-57292071.jpg ) instead . 
  you turn the gas on and there 's a little spark which lights it and you put your pots and pans on the flame and cook . 
  they used to be more dangerous back in the day where you can accidently leave it on and the apartment would get filled with gas and explode , but modern stoves have safety features which turn the gas off after a short time if there is no flame . 
  also , before the spark mechanism , you would just light it with a match . 
  if memory serves me correctly , in fight club , the apartment explosion was caused by the gas stove being left on . 
  how come they did n't go with `` chehia '' , `` chechia '' is bound to attract some mispronunciation ? 
  no one will give it back , that would be political suicide . 
  even navalny , the only opposition member who comes even a little close to ever winning already said he would not return it . 
  the difference is that baltic countries were different ethnically and culturally , crimea is pretty much fully russian . 
  the most , definitely beluga noble vodka . 
  they also have more premium ones like gold line , but the normal one is already so good , it 's hard to improve it . 
  yanukovich never had much power . 
  assuming that putin and erdogan are , yanukovich did not have nearly the control that both of them have . 
  he was about to lose the election big time too . 
  no one is saying he was n't corrupt . 
  but he won the election fair and square . 
  he would have lost the next one though , which was supposed to happen like a year after the revolution . 
  damn you !, 
  what other one is there ? 
  oh yeah , i forgot the `` oy '' . 
  they are quite rare , and become `` aya '' . 
  others remain the same . 
  dictionary.com : `` dictator - a person exercising absolute power , especially a ruler who has absolute , unrestricted control in a government without hereditary succession . '', 
  nope , the word still does n't fit . 
  sweet , trivia !, 
  in 1855 , dentist robert arthur was the first to use gold to fill cavities . 
  hitler was not a dictator at first though . 
  just like yanukovich was n't ever . 
  he was elected in a fair election . 
  i do n't think you know that much on the subject . 
  how is he a dictator , he was an elected president ? 
  some of the ones who jumped out and lied injured on the ground were then beaten by the mob . 
  they 're pretty straight forward , emotional arguments for , pragmatic arguments against . 
  you should publicly denounce her !, 
  enemy of the people !, 
  hopefully more make it out alive , truly sad :(, 
  lol sorry . 
  knowledge is everything . 
  shhh , wait until election is over . 
  wo n't come to that . 
  he was not . 
  there is a minimum number of votes needed to impeach , which they did n't have . 
  unlikely . 
  unless something major happens , fillon will win comfortably . 
   ukraine ( hopefully one day ) retakes crimea highly doubtful . 
  it 's an organisation which embarrasses women , look how they act . 
  they do n't stand for anything , they 're just bored unemployed young girls . 
  well , not in the sense that she sleeps with guys for money ( although i ca n't say for sure ) , but in the sense that she is a floosy . 
  normal women do not get their tits out in public , know what i mean . 
  all those things you mention became better under putin though . 
  i think it 's fair to say that he is responsible for the success , the society reformed and became better under him , he cracked down on criminals , he reined in the oligarchs , ended the chechen conflict . 
  market has nothing to do with this . 
  he worked in gdr , that 's right . 
  we have a joker !, 
  lol reread my comment . 
  what else is there ? 
  non russians / polish surnames normally just do n't morph and are the same male/female . 
  this is actually an example of a bad prostitute . 
  oppressed serbian minority , you say ? 
  close enough !, 
  uralmash - ural nash !, 
  it was just one example of an early russian state , eventually all the lands were gathered and they became the tsardom . 
  that 's how all countries formed , britain was also once a collection of independent kingdoms , eventually wessex came out on top and gathered the lands into a single state . 
  stay away from the mines of mordor !, 
  kievan rus was founded by oleg of novgorod after he conquered lands and united little kingdoms into one , moving the capitol of rus to kiev . 
  it eventually declined and power shifted back to novgorod . 
  then our ancestors conquered the moscow region which eventually became the strongest rus state and consolidated all the russian lands into a single tsardom . 
  most of these lands were all together until 1991 . 
  kievan rus was one of the early russian states , it stands out because it was the first time that russian people attained a more or less united , sizeable state . 
  oh , you will fit right in then , russians are all finno ugric mongols . 
  i 've tried zubrowka , it 's quite good , although belvedere tastes smoother iirc . 
  i 'll have to check out soplica , looks like it has quite a bit of history behind it .

  soviet and later russian propaganda also played a large part in this . 
  when now sources like rt are banned on / r/europe outright , effectively saying `` we do n't believe anything you say '' , it is also a measure of how bad the russian propaganda is , not only its western counterpart . 
  just look at the piece of news that hit this subreddit several days ago , about the `` putin enemy '' journalist who committed suicide in kiev . 
  he left russia long time ago , went to ukraine and started criticizing ukrainian government the same way he was criticizing the russian government before ; but most people simply assumed that it was the hand of kremlin who killed him , even though he wrote about suicide before . 
  critical thinking is just non-existent when we talk about stereotype conditioning . 
  i hear a lot about how all russians are brainwashed . 
  i wo n't even contest this point . 
  but do n't you see that all people are brainwashed by the media ? 
  it 's not the case of good guys and bad guys , it 's not a hollywood movie - every single source of major news outlets has its own agenda . 
  the only winning move is not to play , i.e. 
  stop consuming the mass media . 
  no , you did n't offend anyone . 
  this simplistic explanation is plain stupid in application to any world leader . 
  do you really think that a high-ranking official with a complete control over his own security service would not find another way to satiate any of his tastes ? 
  without publicly visiting some school in the uk ? 
  do you really think that ? 
  whatever are his tastes in bed have nothing to do with his public visits . 
  he can get anything he wants for him personally , without any publicity . 
  case in point . 
  russia is not a superpower . 
  we already have some more attainable goals . 
  if anything , russia would be more interested in keeping the political status quo in moldova than initiating any changes . 
  of course , that must be it . 
  no other explanation , really , only that . 
  he was just activating a sleeper cell , duh . 
   but on the other hand it is remarkable that blaming poles for killing jews intensifies . 
  most productions ( including famous ones ) is strongly propaganda against poles . 
  this was such case . 
  welcome to the club . 
  many people nowadays sincerely believe that ussr started wwii and stalin killed more people than hitler . 
  that 's a result of several decades of propaganda . 
  i 'm fairly sure that by 2040 people will believe that poles were initiating the jew purges , and germans were just allowing them to . 
  unless something drastically changes in the media , that is . 
  you 're talking to a german person there . 
  of course he has a right to judge how untermensch behave . 
  oh , so i guess what / u/ro4ers said was not  start treating other countries as equals . 
  but  start treating other european countries as equals . 
  fuck the rest !, 
  we should treat everyone as equal , but some should be more equal than the others . 
  ukraine would have been fairly stable today if there was no coup in kiev that was followed by bloodshed in kiev and odessa . 
  and all they had to do was to wait for 4 months till the early elections took place . 
  then russia would not have any casus to take over crimea - we 've already seen that during orange revolution 10 years ago , when the actually peaceful protests ( not violent takeover of government buildings by neonazi and other ultra-nationalists ) led to re-election , and russia calmly accepted that , only waging economic war . 
  funny that a person from ukraine denounce russian propaganda without saying a word about ukrainian propaganda . 
  our propaganda is shit , with people like kiselev as the main shithead , but we do n't even hold a candle to yours . 
  how many times per month does ukrainian media warn of imminent full-scale invasion of russian forces that can take over kiev any day if the glorious eu/usa do n't send help immediately ? 
  i mean , come on , rt is at the very least on the same level ( if not at a higher level ) of quality as ukrainian media claiming that [ moscow citizens start to cook hedgehogs because of widespread hunger ] ( http://uapress.info/uk/news/show/48857/ ) or uk media claiming that [ russian football fans were secretly trained by kremlin as a part of hybrid warfare ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/18/whitehall-suspects-kremlin-links-to-russian-euro-2016-hooligans-vladimir-putin ) . 
   you `` prove '' you have n't violated the regulations by taking part in the tests and getting negative results . 
  if those tests turn out to have been tampered with by your government , you no longer have any evidence . 
  then take the tests again , in an independent lab . 
  is it not a logical step ? 
  how is a blanket ban warranted just because the system is flawed ? 
  is the competition not about individuals proving their fitness ? 
  in 2014 russia was not even in the top 10 of the nations with banned athletes . 
  then suddenly , after the political climate changed , it all moved to `` omg russia is the worst , ban them all ! '' . 
  and the most widespread reason for the failed tests right now is the usage of meldonium , which has been in use by eastern european athletes for over 30 years , yet was banned with astonishing swiftness in the beginning of 2016 ( placed on watchlist in september 2015 ) - the strangest of coincidences . 
  every olympian is doped by everything that 's not quite crossing the line , and some take a step forward . 
  even enlightened western countries do the same shit , they just cover it better by using private companies , like in that usa doping scandal in 2008 . 
  yet i 've never seen blanket bans , just bans of the users , which is actually completely accepted . 
  of course . 
  it 's the most cost-efficient place . 
  there are many alternatives , but they are either more expensive or worse in quality . 
  turkey is a sweet spot for that . 
  believe me , our girls were really pissed off when access to the turkish shores were earlier this year . 
  no better place to tan those russian bodies than turkey . 
  after this pitch i can only add : join the russo-turkish side , we have cookies !, 
  that 's not a `` positive evidence you have n't been doping '' . 
  how can you ** prove ** that you have n't violated the olympic anti-doping regulations ? 
  so , let 's say you really followed them all . 
  then a guy comes who says `` give me positive evidence that you did '' . 
  how do you do that ? 
  ah , sorry , did n't get the irony . 
  cheers . 
  imagine your whole team was banned in 2003 for [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balco_scandal ) . 
  not only the ones who were proved taking drugs , but all the team . 
  would n't you be the first one to call it unethical , unlawful and undemocratic ? 
  license is something that allows you to do something . 
  dope control is something that forbids you to do something . 
  they are inherently different . 
  you can prove that you have something ( license , in this case ) . 
  you can not prove that you do n't have something , unless that something is automatically monitored 100 % of the time ( like , say , money in a bank ) . 
  try prove that you , say , never hit a dog . 
  can you do that ? 
  of course not . 
  the burden of proof is on me , if i claim you did . 
   i think you need positive evidence you have n't been doping , rather than a lack of evidence that you have . 
  how can you provide evidence you have n't been doping ? 
  just for a second imagine that you , personally , are tasked with providing positive evidence that you have n't taken drugs . 
  how can you do that ? 
  provide video surveillance of every minute of your time in the last year to prove you did n't have time ? 
  wo n't work , the drug could be slipped with your food/water . 
  take independent tests 3 times a day for a year ? 
  way too costly . 
  so how are you planning to do that ? 
  if you want to open that can of worms , it opens up any athlete ever to be banned completely , regardless of guilt . 
  i overall agree with the political assessment ( though of course it 's not as simple ) , but not really on religious . 
  i 'm not sure why do you think having good relations with mostly christian states is a detriment for the leader of muslim world . 
  on the opposite , who else would contact with christians if not the leader of muslims ? 
  christianity , judaism and islam all have very close religious roots . 
  iirc , muslims can not even announce jihad towards christians and judaists unless it 's the war for territory - they ca n't even call them infidels ( by the book ) . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , jesus is seen in islam as a prophet ( of lesser status than mohammed ) , not as false god .

  it 's not true . 
  `` junta '' was widely used in news , eg http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=1550133# , just like `` fascists '' and `` banderites '' . 
  there is a video somewhere on liveleak where azeri soldiers show off to people a head of armenian soldier like a trophy . 
  also during that short war they managed to shot and cut ears off [ of that old couple in tilash ] ( http://hetq.am/eng/news/66976/azerbaijani-soldiers-execute-elderly-armenian-couple-in-artsakh-then-cut-off-their-ears.html ) . 
   the ebu regards the romanian state as legally obliged to underwrite tvr 's debt which goes back as far as january 2007 . 
  it 's not their first stupid move in that direction . 
  their bans are extremely funny . 
  one of the first russian tv channels they banned was rbc tv , independent russian business news channel that has nothing to do with state propaganda . 
  they banned even old movies by famous ukrainian directors , because some supporting roles were performed by actors blacklisted by ukraine 20-30 years after the film release . 
  one ukrainian tv channel bought 4 seasons of russian sitcom `` kitchen '' , a blacklisted russian person appeared in _ one _ episode of the _ 5th _ season ( the season they did n't even buy ! ), 
  -- and the whole sitcom was banned . 
  and maybe the funniest shit -- french comedy movie `` la ch\u00e8vre '' from 1980s is apparently banned , because a leading role was performed by g\u00e9rard depardieu blacklisted in ukraine . 
   want to overthrow it we see how `` well '' it went in ukraine , it was a great experiment with notoriously negative results . 
  nobody here wants to turn russia into ukraine . 
  maskhadov already introduced sharia law at the time . 
  he did n't do anything against basaev even after russian request in august 1999 , he did n't even publicly condemn the basaev 's invasion of dagestan . 
  maskhadov ca n't blame anyone but himself in that situation , it 's a complete joke that some in the west are trying to paint maskhadov as some reasonable alternative ignored by russia . 
  kadyrov , who agreed to fight against basayev , khattab & co. , was welcomed by russia and immediately kicked out by maskhadov . 
  belarus has [ high tech park ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belarus_high_technologies_park ) with tax privileges , it worked pretty well . 
   when i read about ukraine in wikipedia , i see that they produce highly sophisticated goods : airplanes , trucks , satellites , even spacecrafts . 
  ukraine produced 3 new planes in 2014 , 2 in 2015 ( military + civilian ) . 
  to put this in perspective , russia produced 161 new plane in 2014 ( 124 military , 37 civilian ) , 140 military planes alone in 2015 , also 271 new helicopters in 2014 , 280 helicopters in 2015 . 
   satellites , even spacecrafts . 
  russia was the largest partner of the ukrainian space program . 
   also they have lots of it specialists . 
  it 's not that successful in it field . 
  ukraine exported $ 1.2 b of it services in 2015 ( ~ 10 % less than in 2014 ) , 4x smaller belarus -- ~ $ 800m . 
  ( [ belarus 2015 stats ] ( http://www.nbrb.by/publications/balpay/balpay2015.pdf ) , [ ukraine 2015 stats ] ( https://ukrstat.org/operativ/operativ2015/zd/ztp/ztp_r/ztp04_15_r.htm ) ) . 
  they are also planning to [ block local rfe/rl site ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/society/19/04/2016/57160cc49a7947eb633089e5 ) for wrecking :  it 's a [ wrecking ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wrecking_%28soviet_crime%29 ) service , in their publications there are justifications for subversive activities , extremism and endless discreditation of crimean authorities , incitement to ethnic hatred . 
  i am not a russian nationalist , but i 'll try . 
  probably because it did n't happen . 
  if it happened `` last week '' , why polish officials did n't protest already ? 
  so far all we have some unnamed forester interviewed by `` gazeta polska codziennie '' , low quality right-wing polish newspaper . 
  moreover , it was published on monday , but there is still no official polish reaction . 
  i found the source on twitter : https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cgweetywsaedmyq.jpg:large unnamed forester , unknown location ( `` right in a forest '' ) , unknown type of helicopters , unknown date ( `` last week '' ) . 
  yeah , sounds entirely legit . 
   and it is mainly eu funded once again , it 's not true :  in 2009 full financing of the eur 50 million plant was confirmed with the russian funds from the federal target programme to pay for the construction , installation and detailed designs , while grants from ndep ( eur 10 million ) and sida ( eur 11.5 millilon ) were assigned to the purchase of equipment . 
  in late 2009 , following the russian procurement regulations , ojsc mostostroy no 6 was selected by auction as the main contractor . 
  the construction works have been proceeding since 2010 . 
  70 % by russia , 30 % by eu . 
  you need to find some new reason to blame russia . 
   but what about russia ? 
  whatabout russian politicians ? 
  well , unlike you , i am not denying that rogozin says stupid shit all the time and looks silly . 
  i do n't blame foreign propaganda for his stupid shit . 
  it seems that omnipotent russian propaganda mind-controls your leaders to make them do silly things and look funny in the eyes of other people : * [ reuters - lithuania prepares for a feared russian invasion ] ( http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2015/03/15/lithuania-prepares-for-a-feared-russian-invasion/ ) * [ vice - lithuania thinks the russians are coming -- and it 's preparing with wargames ] ( https://news.vice.com/article/lithuania-thinks-the-russians-are-coming-and-its-preparing-with-wargames ) * [ foreign policy - lithuania to citizens : in case of russian invasion , ` do your job worse than usual ' ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/01/16/lithuania-to-citizens-in-case-of-russian-invasion-do-your-job-worse-than-usual/ ), 
  actually , the kaliningrad wastewater treatment plant was completed in 2015 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzw3zhigijg it will achieve its full capacity later this year . 
  st. petersburg treated 74 % of its wastewater in 1997 , 85 % in 2005 ( thanks to completion of [ uzos south-west wastewater treatment plant ] ( http://www.water-technology.net/projects/uzos/ ) during the putin 's second term ) , 98.4 % in 2013 . 
  according to current plans , st. petersburg will treat 100 % of its sewage in 2020 . 
   stop projecting . 
  look , russia is the largest country in the world , it has one of the strongest military in the world and it does n't hesitate to use it , it 's the 2nd largest arms exporter in the world , and it 's 5th-6th world 's economy by gdp ( ppp ) . 
  you are free to continue your `` la-la-la , i do n't hear you , russia is shit , shit '' routine , but it 's a bit silly . 
   nato and syria lol `` lol '' is almost perfect description of the us activity in syria , but i think `` lol wtf '' will be a bit better . 
   completely alienating your `` brother '' nation ukraine , which would n't have joined nato for a decade or two even without the whole crimea/eastern ukraine ordeal . 
  ukraine sought for nato member accession plan back in 2008 . 
  due to russia opposition and war on donbass the expansion was blocked . 
  there are 0 % chances that ukraine will be accepted to nato in the coming 20 years . 
   the dog barks , but the caravan goes on . 
  you have a point . 
  you can bark on russia as much as you want , but it 's not very productive . 
  you are so deep in denial it 's not even funny . 
  like it or not , russia has the 2nd strongest army in the world and largest nuke arsenal . 
  it 's not a superpower like the us , but it 's a major regional power with its own [ military alliance ctso ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collective_security_treaty_organization ) . 
   you 're disagreement boils down to crying about nato encroachment on state tv . 
  russian successful involvement in ukraine , georgia , syria never happened , it was an illusion probably . 
  continue to consume your propaganda that russia does n't matter , but your own leaders do n't believe in that anymore . 
  i see , discrimination ( against ethnic groups you do n't care about like russians ) is just human nature , but americans prefer genocide . 
  nice to know new bits about western democracy . 
  better for you ? 
  no , thanks , motion denied . 
  we never doubted it for a second . 
  that 's why we need strong army . 
   in the end , russia does the same things that they accuse the us of doing sure , we are the same , both russia and the us use the same double standards , and blame their opponents for their own sins . 
  of course , russia is much weaker , poorer , and much less influential than the us . 
   no proof of this , i assume you are referring to ukraine . 
  there were [ truckloads of color revolutions already ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colour_revolution ) , it 's not just euromaidan . 
  i doubt the us directly financed euromaidan ( there were enough of local oligarchs to do that ) , however , it financed plenty of pro-maidan ngos through usaid and it openly sponsors post-maidan pro-west government . 
   crimea was a sham vote . 
  i dont care if they want to be part of russia , hold a real vote and i would respect it . 
  are elections some kind of religious ritual for you ? 
  no less than 80 % of crimean population support reunification with russia -- that 's according to various western polls ( e.g. 
  [ gfk ] ( http://imgur.com/a/rm5aa ) , [ gallup ] ( http://www.bbg.gov/wp-content/media/2014/06/ukraine-slide-deck.pdf ) , [ pew research ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/05/08/despite-concerns-about-governance-ukrainians-want-to-remain-one-country/ ) ) . 
  certainly there were voting irregularities on the 2014 crimean referendum , but there is no doubt in its outcome -- overwhelming majority of crimean population supported reunification with russia . 
   all of the other countries barely exist due to russian kindness , they are not friends or allies . 
  lol . 
  belarus has ~ 2x gdp ( ppp ) per capita of pro-western ukraine or pro-western moldova , kazakhstan has ~ 3x gdp . 
  `` barely exist '' . 
   no one has this right . 
  all of our allies are voluntary allies and have the right to leave whenever they want . 
  yeah ... 
  but for some reason , when yanukovich decided to join our customs union , the us supported anti-government pro-western riots in ukraine in response . 
  the eu also forced ukraine to decline russian proposal , [ spiegel ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/war-in-ukraine-a-result-of-misunderstandings-between-europe-and-russia-a-1004706.html ) : `` the kremlin then proposed to brussels that negotiations be conducted between the eu and the eurasion union -- directly between the two blocs of power . 
  but european commission president jos\u00e9 manuel barroso refused to meet with the leaders of the eurasion union , a bloc he considered to be an eu competitor . 
  `` one country can not at the same time be a member of a customs union and be in a deep common free-trade area with the european union , ''  they fucked over azerbaijan and armernia at the end of the soviet union , started civil wars in ukraine and georgia . 
  looks like russia is some kind of evil demiurge for you . 
  ethnic conflicts are nothing special during country dissolution , see yugoslavia . 
  it 's just silly to blame russia for that . 
  it was n't russia who invented '' [ georgia for gergians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgia_for_georgians ) '' slogan and it was n't russia who started ethnic tensions in georgia . 
  maybe russia was partially guilty in the nagorno-karabakh conflict , i am not denying it , but russia also helped to stop it . 
  in ukraine the west supported the takeover of pro-western nationalist majority that tried to ignore opinion of pro-russian minority -- and it did n't go well .

  the alliance attacked a sovereign country , killed or injured hundreds of civilians and temporarily occupied part of the territory . 
  regardless of good or bad intentions ( or their moral obligations for that matter ) , they acted as an invading force . 
   according to nato the operation sought to stop human rights abuses in kosovo , [ 40 ] and it was the first time that the organisation used military force without the approval of the un security council . 
  [ 41 ] on a side note , the un had nothing to do with * the bombing * . 
  i 'm not going to debate whether that was uncalled for or not . 
  someone might say that the serbs got it right on the money and yet others could think that the bombing of residential areas was a war crime . 
  our emotions are irrelevant to the topic . 
  the question , as i understood it , was `` can the nato be aggressive under some circumstances ? '', 
  the short answer is yes . 
  the longer answer may be along the lines of `` yes , when it suits them '' or `` yes , when they have to satisfy the public demand '' . 
   is n't it only a defensive alliance ? 
  [ nato bombing of yugoslavia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_bombing_of_yugoslavia ), 
  indeed , we drink and smoke a lot . 
  we really love pets and animals in general . 
  in some cases , we love these furry bastards more than people . 
  risking own life to save a pet - oh , it 's normal . 
  we too call it `` panel ` ka '' , `` khruzhevka '' is a special term for the first wave 5-storey building , which has inner walls made from paper blocks : /, 
  really ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  perhaps , you may enlighten me . 
  coz it 's a natural way of behaving for the human being ? 
  war is bad and all that stuff . 
  why ? 
  how is it any different from ' a former drug addict ' or ' a former criminal ' ? 
  more like a whole neighborhood built of khruzhevkas . 
  moscow has a program of demolishing these old 5-storeys and moving tenants into newly built apartments . 
  for free , by the way . 
  [ according to the moscow government ] ( https://stroi.mos.ru/news/v-moskve-ostalos-snesti-177-pyatietazhek ) , 177 khruzhevkas are left to go on 4 aug 2015 . 
  about 90 % done . 
  it 's not an improvement at all . 
  demushkin & co were banned for their strict position against the war with ukraine . 
  generally , the newer the neighborhood , the less problems with parking it has . 
  having a traffic jam in moscow is like snow in the winter , so , do n't even get me started on that . 
  i 'm not really sure who you addressed with your comment . 
  demushkin and the said movement ( now suspended ) were the only reason i went to the rally where i took these pictures . 
  here , in the 21th century it 's called the `` apartment buildings '' . 
  as someone who lived in a real commieblock in his childhood , i may assure you : both things are not the same . 
   it was the 10th annual gathering of white supremacists , neo-nazis and far-right nationalists , held in moscow in november . 
  [ pictures taken during the rally ] ( http://imgur.com/a/gwsdo ) , if anyone interested . 
   `` nationalism has a bright future in russia , '' said co-organizer dmitri demushkin , 36 , a former skinhead and ex-leader of the slavic union , a banned group whose russian initials , ss , intentionally mimic those of the nazi paramilitaries . 
  `` we will either win or the russian people will die . '', 
  in the last years , demushkin was a founding leader of the nationalist movement `` the russians '' . 
  aand it 's gone . 
  a week ago , on aug 14 , the political activities of the group has been suspended by the moscow prosecutor 's office . 
  `` the russians '' got banned in russia !, 
  oh , what cruel irony . 
  i 'm by far not a naive person . 
  it 's only my laziness that keeps me from writing long rants . 
  anyway , here 's a rare moment of agreement between us . 
  one quick look at what was done to his public image ( let alone the country turning into a laughing stock of the world ) , reveals that he is light years away from `` fulfilling his desires '' . 
  one thing is for sure , though : he is further from achieving his ambition than he was before the sochi olympics . 
  which is sad , actually . 
  he 's by far the most intelligent leader in the modern history of russia . 
  perhaps , all the years spent surrounded by ` yes men ' have finally taken their toll . 
  or he 's just getting old , haha . 
  turns out i 'm either stupid or blind . 
  the only thing about the dearest leader that i believe is of value is that he is seeking recognition ( or , at least , respect ) as a world-renowned leader playing the big role in the world politics . 
  he may want to isolate * the country * , while trying to keep a grip on power at home . 
  but i doubt he wants to isolate * himself * from the world . 
   will ruin his dream to rebuild army and restart cold war let me guess : is this what you found out looking into a crystal ball ? 
  or laughing , while having money parked in foreign banks ... 
  there is nothing unusual in the cb policy . 
  just a natural way of forming the exchange rate in a petrostate . 
  actually , it 's not like that they can do anything else at this point . 
  i meant the first few pages of / r/europe . 
  just to make sure that there 's no `` barrage of the russian propaganda posted here '' . 
  well , i 've just trawled through the first few pages but failed to find a single posting that could be described as `` pro-russian '' . 
  luckily for us , the situation here is nowhere near as dire as it might be . 
  the pro-regime propaganda rarely hits the front page , thus there is no need for ad hominem and name calling . 
  either way , it would be better to address the content than to shoot the messenger . 
  i 'm personally a big fan of how vice is looking at the situation in ukraine . 
  let 's give it a try . 
  he was reportedly sacked for his inappropriate behavior during the raid . 
  ninja edit : [ source in ru ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2015/08/21/sankcii/ ), 
  til that vice news is a kremlin mouthpiece . 
  the sad truth is that sanctions or not , crisis or not , life has always been grim for rural dwellers in places like this . 
  oh , please no !, 
  i 'd shit my pants if i ever met him . 
  [ stas baretsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanislav_baretsky ), 
  just the usual nonsense along the lines `` do n't we have our own breweries [ in the country ] !? '', 
  i like the moment when he says : `` no , it 's absolutely not a pr stunt !, 
  '' , and a second later : `` yes , it * is * the pr . '', 
  stas baretsky ( the dude in red ) ftw !, 
  man , i love this clown , though he went full retard with all that patriotic nonsense . 
  been drinking a lot this week . 
  now i 'm going out of town for a while . 
  i beg to differ . 
  a genuine war has nothing to do with embarassment . 
  after all , what matters in the end is the result . 
  the far east is russia 's . 
  siberia ? 
  yep . 
  the p-l commonwealth is long gone . 
  even the authentic mongols are using cyrillic these days , haha . 
  so hard to choose , it 's all so delicious . 
  i think i 'll go with the whole molotov-ribbentrop pact and its consequences ( occupation of the baltics , partitioning of poland , katyn , etc etc ) . 
  yep , it 's in the news . 
  that 's just a sign that the country is in the denial stage . 
  hopefully , it will pass soon . 
  the average life expectancy in russia is around 70 .

  but i can name one band i sometimes listen to : buck tick . 
  i also like mozart l'op\u00e9ra rock in french . 
  usually at 13 . 
  i have been to novosibirsk ( technically asia ) and the us . 
  most russians never leave russia , so we are similar to the americans in that regard . 
  my guess is : to show off high status . 
  it 's one of those big expensive suvs , like porsche cayenne , lexus lx , bmw x6 , gelandewagen , etc. 
  suvs are also rather convenient on russian roads , unlike sport cars . 
  i do heat water/beverages in microwave if i need only one cup . 
  other than that , heating leftover food or food from a supermarket . 
  i have no experience with other countries , but drivers in moscow are nuts . 
  i mean , wtf is [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/tqr4yhjp-ks?t=2m ) , for example . 
   is russia officially europe ? 
  most of russian population lives in the european part . 
  some young people i know do n't own a tv and feel no need to . 
  there are 3 tv sets in my flat , but i almost never use them . 
  if i lived alone , i would get rid of them whatsoever . 
  sometimes i watch biathlon , but i could watch it on my pc as well . 
  apparently [ there is ] ( http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2fs10508-010-9696-y ) ( even for the czech republic !, 
  ) :  of particular note is that this country , like denmark and japan , had a prolonged interval during which possession of child pornography was not illegal and , like those other countries , showed a significant decrease in the incidence of child sex abuse . 
  i 'm not sure how conclusive this study is , but it 's quite an interesting topic for discussion . 
  i 'm all for banning actual cp as it 's a business built upon child abuse . 
  but laws banning cp often ban fictional cp as well , which i find rather stupid because there are no victims in the production of fiction . 
  unlike most ( if not all ) eu countries , watch and posses child porn . 
  only production and distribution are illegal . 
  [ party for everybody ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgustrmjzyc ) , sang mostly in udmurt language , got 2nd place on eurovision . 
  i have n't seen anyone else doing this , but i pay with my phone sometimes , my bank provides this feature . 
  cashiers do n't usually seem surprised . 
  it 's not a huge improvement over a contactless debit card . 
  it 's a little bit easier to get the phone out of the pocket , but i usually have to find my wallet nonetheless because of discount cards . 
  it is taught in most schools ( some teach german or french instead ) , but it 's usually forgotten after the school . 
  i would n't expect a random person in the street to speak english . 
  english proficiency in russia is one of the worst in europe . 
  the first m is palatalized . 
  i remember them flying to sochi during the last summer . 
  but at the moment they have no flights from/to nn . 
  god , there are even no direct flights to stp at the moment . 
  aeroflot currently does n't have many alternatives , especially for flying from nizhny novgorod . 
  i think they are quite good . 
  however , i have n't had much experience with flying other companies , the only other flag carrier i have flown by is air baltic . 
  the government has their controlling stake , so they are managed mostly by the government and do get special treatment from the government . 
  aeroflot gets almost all taxes from foreign companies flying over russia . 
  they also receive government subsidies to maintain unprofitable flights between regions of russia . 
  aeroflot is also the only big russian company using a considerable number of russian jets ( ssj ) , as they are forced to buy them . 
  it is a thing for political stuff . 
  but it is less popular than vk , ok , facebook , instagram , and livejournal . 
  i use it to follow people and companies i find interesting , but i rarely write anything myself . 
  i know many very different russians . 
  my opinion of the population of russia in general is rather negative for political reasons , but i try not to make any assumptions about individual people before i know them . 
  our kitchen and bathroom are too small for a washing machine . 
  yes . 
  but you may consider the domestic passport as a less convenient version of an id card with a little bit more info . 
  freedom of movement inside russia is a constitutional right . 
  i think it 's possible to drive around russia without this passport , using only a driving license . 
  it is necessary to have at least some identification on you just in case , but a driving licence should be sufficient for the police . 
  hotels also can have problems with this , i 'm not sure if they accept anything but a passport . 
  our domestic passport is also sufficient to travel to belarus , kazakhstan , and abkhazia . 
  it used to be sufficient to travel to ukraine , but now they require a regular foreign passport . 
  the domestic passport is a local identity document ( afaik , almost all european countries have id cards for that ) . 
  it 's always used if you need to identify yourself using a document ( like when buying a train ticket , making a contract , etc ) . 
  the foreign passport is used only to travel abroad . 
  in fact , only 28 % of russians have one . 
  yes , it is celebrated . 
  this year it 's the same day as catholic easter , april 16 . 
  people usually eat [ kulich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kulich ) and gift [ painted eggs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/easter_egg ) to each other . 
  when i was a kid , we also used to build a small sand slide and roll down these eggs , trying to crack other children 's eggs . 
  for some reason , people also tend to do a particularly thorough cleaning in their homes just before easter . 
  i 'm an atheist , i 'm neutral to slightly irritated when it comes to easter . 
  i do not like the part when everyone you meet greets you with '' \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435 ! '', 
  ( `` christ is risen !, 
  '' ) , and you are supposed to answer with '' \u0412\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0443 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435 ! '', 
  ( `` indeed risen ! '' ) . 
  i answer for the sake of being polite , but i ca n't say i enjoy it . 
  i have two passports , a domestic and a foreign ones . 
  this should be rather unusual for europe , i suppose . 
  the foreign one is boring , but it contains multiple visas which make it a little bit more interesting . 
  the domestic one currently contains only basic info and my registered place of living . 
  it can also contain additional info , like marriage , children , military status , blood group . 
  undoubtedly match tv . 
  its main channel is public , and there are several paid channels , so they together cover a lot of different events . 
  their only competitor is probably eurosport which i usually find somewhat boring . 
  i watch only biathlon though . 
  why ca n't i speak ukrainian ? 
  it 's similar enough to russian that i began to understand it just by listening to it long enough , but differences hold me from actually speaking it . 
  grammar is somewhat different , so i will definitely make a lot of mistakes with cases and conjugation , but it does n't affect my ability to understand in any way . 
  also , my active and passive vocabularies are very different in size , because i often hear and read ukrainian , but i have never had any experience speaking or writing . 
  so when i hear a ukrainian word , i usually understand what it means or just guess from the context ; but i find it hard to find proper ukrainian words if i try to speak . 
  even some ukrainians speak with a mixture of russian and ukrainian knows as [ surzhyk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surzhyk ) . 
  russian and english . 
  i also understand ukrainian quite well , but ca n't speak it . 
  not much , i 'm too young for that . 
  i 'm fairly sure anything i pay now will have no effect on my pension . 
  on such time scales , even the existence of the country is uncertain . 
  vodka . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu5kswkzqoi ) . 
  a fine song , but terrible pronunciation . 
  does n't matter , though , as we do n't actually have an entry anymore . 
  yes , i 've discussed this topic with my friends a couple of times . 
  i do n't care if people are fat . 
  it 's just none of my business , even if it is unhealthy for them .

  it is your problem that you pay 50k a month for a non-qualified middle asian migrant for your grandma , not your achievement . 
  a nurse has nothing common with a babysitter , it is a qualified medical specialist . 
  a man who hires a migrant in moscow to sit with his baby has big problems with mental state by default . 
   which necessitated the extermination of 50 % to 100 % of european nations under germany 's control , and that was just in the first 30 years . 
  and 200 % of european nations exterminated in the next 30 years . 
  well , they are when they are ( in the strange accident ) directed against regimes that do n't correctly order their priorities in balancing between eu and us . 
  yes . 
  only in the reality of the man in the high castle they would n't speak about it . 
  only some eastern europeans once per year pushing the issue of `` return our amber room '' . 
  as germans in our world remember about dresden , the city of arts , sometimes . 
   as you mean dirty jobs performed by russia in the interest of europe yeah , it 's exactly what i meant ( maybe that is the reason why i wrote it after all ) . 
  georgia , ukraine . 
  truman 's america did what is called ` holocaust ' . 
  it is untrue to call the consequences of the final decision all-the-burning . 
  nazis did not burn everything , they even did not burn people alive , only their corpses . 
  truman 's america did . 
  in the alternate reality where the third reich wins the second world war , some greek user would wrote about how the european nations could survive japan ( they managed to survive even the third reich ) . 
  they would n't survive under the us control . 
  let 's not forget , in his impossible maniacal will to power , in his mad refusal to admit the defeat , the crazy murderer truman did n't stop even to use the most terrific weapon in the history against civil people . 
  when allied armies sieged washington , the president butcher still was giving orders to ` flying strongholds ' to bomb european cities into dust . 
  hitler murdered european jews , but he spared european culture . 
  can you imagine the world where america wins and floods europe with jeans and coca-cola ? 
  it is the very realistic case actually . 
  the last 20 years ( somebody would say 100 ) russia does all the europe 's dirty job . 
  actually , his only flaw was losing the war . 
  things turn other way and now reddit would talk about how close putin/farage is to truman . 
  no , being a nationalistic populist does n't do you one of the worst pieces of shit ever born . 
   we are limiting the number of player allies to 2 . 
  basically , what this means is that you can have at most 2 allies which are played by humans , but as many ai allies as you can get . 
  the reason for this is preventing unrealistically huge alliances which stifle the whole game because everyone 's too afraid to do anything . 
  we want to get a lot of smaller alliance blocks for greater diplomacy and tension !, 
  that 's why massive strategies must have no inner diplomacy system at all , do n't forbidding humans be betraying monsters they are . 
  what has happened with the previous game ? 
  did i miss aar ? 
  yeah . 
  zheleznogorsk is one of the ` closed cities ' built by stalin in 1950s for atomic projects . 
  and so is the coat of arms . 
  eu border officer : may i have a little kiss before you go ? 
  i 'm very lonely here . 
  yeah . 
  we told before . 
  you said you are a part-time social worker with no education from the poor region who can not buy a private apartment and therefore russia is bad . 
  i am ashamed to be a compatriot of a guy who is able to call the topic `` my daily life '' and then write nothing about his daily life . 
  the worst crime of the bloody regime is definitely the removing of logic lessons from schools . 
   europe needs some people who knows how to value a functioning society . 
  well , the man is definitely not one of this kind . 
  hungary is the same steppe ukraine is . 
  there are ukrainians in ukraine who do n't speak russian , to be more precise . 
  the analog of siberian katorga in french empire was guiana ( also known as ` the dry guillotine ' ) . 
  the another popular place was caucasus that lies in the same climate zone as mediterranean coast and accidentally has a coast ( even two coasts ) too . 
  we should make a song about polish death camps . 
  do n't stand on the red line , duck and hide . 
  ~ ( ~ a ) = a, 
  the whole germany does n't need to join russia simultaneously . 
  we prefer it piece by piece . 
  ban of transit for russian trucks through ukraine, 
  in russia it 's renault logan , not renault . 
  maybe because anti-gmo laws ? 
  for russia it 's the main reason why tomatoes are tasteless shit . 
  it is not related with channel one . 
  majority of russians know kasyanov from the good old times when there was ort in the place of channel one , and kasyanov was the government member , also known as misha two percents . 
  golden pistols too . 
  no , it is at least average comparing to european ones . 
  gazprom prices are lower because prices are lower . 
  those people ( mostly ) do not `` have no job '' . 
  they have no wish to pay to their governments . 
  it 's the map of black economics . 
  it is n't a huge waste of human potential , it 's a huge waste of taxes and nothing more . 
  what was the reaction of this singaporean when you told him ? 
  only to romanians actually . 
  when i brush teeth by mornings i think about how to inflict pain to romanians , not anyone else . 
  well , maybe sometimes danes . 
  but usually romanians only . 
  because the translator needed to get an anagram of `` i am lord voldemort '' in the end of the second book . 
  they are alternatively tall , actually . 
  as opposite to the `` slavs '' ( slovyane ) - those who speak with words ( slovo ) . 
  nato is unright there . 
  it was the damaging of peace talks first , and the intensification of air strikes as the consequence . 
  so norway is mostly hell . 
  that is what happens when socialists are in power . 
  we invaded and took crimea all by our lonesome and then decided all the questions with turkey too . 
  ukraine can get ears of the dead donkey . 
  the analog of crimea is n't canada . 
  the analog of crimea is florida reagan ( after the fall into dementia ) gifted to the independent texas which strictly demands to admit that these lands ( texas and florida ) are inhabited with the most ancient and culture people of aztecs who built all the cities in north america and invented wheel and fire , then were plundered by damned yankees who slaved it and exploited for three hundred years . 
  if you do n't agree with it or do n't want to say `` howdy , partner '' when greeting people , you are probably damned yankee yourself and must be immediately beheaded on the closest pyramid . 
  now try to find a refugee who will agree to live in bulgaria . 
  if you shorten the name of the president of russia , the president of russia will shorten you . 
  for you vladimir vladimirovich, 
  so euro history did n't teach you anything about eu-wide standards . 
  of course not . 
  you are stalked because you change the facts not because you like or do n't like somebody . 
  you are stalked because you are a liar and you do n't take your words back and do n't admit you are a liar . 
   your not going to kill me with polonium are you ? 
  life in the samsara wheel is enough punishment for you . 
  i would . 
  you say it like something ` my government ' says can make me right or not in this specific case . 
  no , you do n't . 
  you pathologically hate the op and ` the average russian ' , it makes you to distort facts and misinform people . 
  but as it is easily provable , you only turn your words into dust . 
  a man writes `` russian voters wanted a strong headed autocratic tsar leader '' and thinks he said something .

  like there are no legal working migrants in your spain ? 
  why are n't you calling them `` slaves '' ? 
  missile defense wo n't save south korea in case of conflict - north korea has very long-range cannons and arming them with nuclear shells is only a question of time . 
  we developed similar devices in the past , [ 152 mm shells with nuclear warheads ] ( http://wsyakayawsyachina.narod.ru/history/nuclear_museum/p12_a.jpg ) . 
  i doubt that you understand what is a real labour camp . 
  they have settlements here indeed , but they are free . 
  for them it 's a good source of money and a better choice than to remain in their motherland . 
  what else ? 
  we do n't control them , we do n't provide them with technologies or needed materials , they are making their nukes and means of delivery with their own resources . 
  after the west bamboozled iraq and libya about cancelling their nuclear programs and then military interventions happened , it 's north korea 's only option now to make as many nukes as they can , nothing will stop them . 
  it was easier to left you where you was at a time of our leaving . 
  it is produced from ingredients which are produced only in some countries , namely from limes and exotic essential oils . 
  from russia as a whole , of course . 
  in russia 85 % of mcdonald 's food ingredients are local , i do n't know about other countries . 
  it depends since they made their food from local ingredients . 
  be careful not to choke on your aspirations . 
  no , it 's the very same story . 
  there is no line after which some territory is more legitimate than other . 
  exactly : it 's pointless to demand such moves . 
  what about `` stop occupying hawaii '' option ? 
  [ cenotaphs are already pillaged ] ( http://www.e-news.su/uploads/posts/2014-12/1420016839_402507_600.jpg ) . 
   where do you have evidence of this ? 
  evidence of what ? 
   you do n't think there was an economic incentive there to take ukrainians resources ? 
  crimea is not profitable from economical perspective . 
  we already had those ports . 
  where are neanderthals now ? 
  in museum collections . 
  in early 2014 right sector was a real power . 
   where are they in the government then ? 
  they had no government at this point , it was formed later . 
  is ukraine a part of poland already ? 
   people actually believe this ? 
  there is nothing to believe , open your eyes : ukrainian radical nationalists just won coup . 
  they are armed . 
  their representative with nazi emblem on his clothes openly says about their plans on tv channel - i 've posted link to video recording of how his speech . 
  eu and us support them with money and specialists . 
  of course you could believe that they are good guys , but in fact you supported nazis with your taxes . 
  my greetings . 
  they [ prepared for ethnical cleansing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bxufcdmvg0 ) , to equip and send so-called `` trains of friendship '' - railroad trains full of armed radical nationalists and even declared about it on tv . 
  this was the pivotal point for crimea . 
  they have plenty of resources . 
  they do n't know how to extract them , but their new friends will take care of such knowledge . 
  what 's matter is where the pipe located physically , on which soil . 
  current rules could be changed by your politicians , it 's a risk factor that should be minimized . 
  they have business and military interests in ukraine : to sell them american goods , to buy their riches , to give them unserviceable loans , to install military bases . 
  it 's not some kind of conspiracy , you could find for example usaid documentation on this topic freely . 
  poland controls `` yamal '' pipe . 
  why what ? 
  their civil war started not with ` tourists ' or volunteers from russia , it was prepared by us-funded ngo 's , nourished by ukrainian nationalists and sparked after still unknown persons shoot people on the streets of kiev . 
  ` tourists ' are surely not the beginning of their conflict . 
  i have to disappoint you : in case of nuclear war moscow will be destroyed faster than finland , so i would not be able to taste your ashes . 
  invasion of finland in current situation is possible in two scenarios : 1 . 
  finland attacks russia first . 
  in this case answer to your question is obvious . 
  finland joins some military alliance like nato , deploys foreign forces on its soil and this alliance attacks russia first . 
  in this case such a decision to join aggressive alliance would be the reason . 
  what do you worry about ? 
  that you have a couple of regions with 70 % of ethnical russian population which already tried to separate from your mainland through peaceful referendums without much success ? 
  you do n't have such regions , you have nothing to worry about . 
  live peacefully , enjoy benefits of being friends with your neighbors . 
   we never sent our militaries there west is giving ukraine loans which they would not be able to handle in the future and buys its resources - forests , oil and gas fields , largest factories . 
  after some time their rich agricultural lands would be for sale too . 
   there is still fighting in eastern ukraine donbass conflict is a civil war by its nature . 
  both sides are supported by foreign states , of course , but it 's their internal conflict , ukrainian nationals against ukrainian nationals . 
   why in seven hells would we attack ? 
  i do n't know . 
  why finland helped germans with siege of leningrad ? 
   do you really think that i will believe anything that comes from the mouth of someone who just threatened to commit genocide against my people ? 
  you do n't have to believe , you have to think about it . 
  as of nuclear weapons , i thought it was pretty obvious that a country with largest arsenal of nuclear weapons in the whole world have them for killing people , not as some kind of toys ? 
  they were designed for this purpose - to kill people who will try to attack us . 
  i hope they would never be used . 
  who of us two is a bully in the current world ? 
  we have n't started wars since , i think , joining military campaign in afghanistan in 1979 . 
  what about usa ? 
   the political consequences of using nuclear weapons would be very grave that 's why going to war with us is probably not the best idea . 
  but if you or your allies would attack , all means would be used against you . 
  we have n't instigated coup in ukraine , us did it , with political support of eu countries . 
  we know very well what happens with ethnical russians in countries which are funded by us after coups , especially when us make bids on local radical nationalists . 
  realize it , not russia started the conflict . 
   when did the war in donbass end ? 
  when western countries would decide that they would n't support it anymore . 
  the cruelty of present situation is that this civil war is more profitable for the west than to russia or ukrainian people . 
  it was over in a few days after beginning . 
   if russia started an invasion against finland like they did with ukraine , what choice would we have ? 
  to flee , to resign or to turn into radioactive ash . 
  that 's why it 's much better to have good relations with us and be friends instead of starting wars . 
   this is not how anything works . 
  this is exactly how it works in case of ukraine , you just have n't realized that fact yet . 
  the new pipeline is in german interest since germans do n't need poland or ukraine to be able to press on them with their problems . 
  they do n't produce gas themselves , they produce problems and demand for more money and resources . 
   that 's a weird statement . 
  it 's not our business anymore to feed ukraine , now it 's your burden . 
  trump already promised to sell you some coal , americans would also provide your country with money for buying this coal . 
  not for free of course , but who cares now ? 
  there is nothing to * take * from ukraine or poland in this context . 
  we just do n't want to * give * them money . 
  feeding them is your business now , not ours . 
  [ it 's a russian name for ukrainian national hairstyle ] ( https://via-midgard.com//uploads/posts/2011-10/1319042544_xoxol.jpg ) , something like a `` topknot '' , `` forelock '' .

  and they say that there are no nazis in ukraine . 
  so less like hitler , more like stalin ? 
   why romania and moldova do n't just wipe them out ? 
  are you suggesting outright ethnical cleansing ? 
   or do a referendum , but do n't put armed thugs near the voting places . 
  if you 're talking about crimean referendum , then ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxbpagtbgj4 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mci7albmgn0 i failed to find any armed soldiers at the polling stations . 
   the first vector was a struggle with the horde in alliance with europe ; the second , a struggle with europe in alliance with the horde . 
  [ ... ] daniil galitsky chose the former course , `` a natural and logical one at the cultural-historical level , '' and aleksandr nevsky chose the latter , `` a most profound perversion with far-reaching consequences . '' wat, 
   but he was a oligarch before . 
  was ? 
   because its not a study funded by the russian government so you refuse to accept it . 
  i refuse to accept it not because it is not ` funded by the russian government ' but because there 's nothing in this article besides hearsay . 
  ` some activists say that ... ' and similar bullshit . 
  the only evidence that can be accepted in any discussion is hard facts . 
   ** there is evidence ** that the new `` anti-propaganda '' laws have ** seriously increased violence ** against the lgbt community ( including killings ) . 
  are those your words ? 
  yes , they are . 
  where 's that evidence ? 
  do provide , or stfu already . 
  no data then . 
  too bad . 
   i hate your country for what it has done to the romanian nation in particular you should hate yourself for helping nazis in ww2 . 
   i said nothing about whether or not russia considered us an antagonist . 
  i would not have known . 
  but you can expect something when you do something . 
  building a missile shield around russia does n't translate to a message that nato/usa are ` too busy making money to worry about russia ' . 
  quite the contrary . 
  y so butthurt ? 
   we have to rely on outside news agencies . 
  and we 're seeing data collected by those agencies any second now ... 
   the sepratists started shooting first no they did n't . 
  not on military operation scale , at least . 
  what is certainly not debatable that there were no attempts from kiev government to defuse the situation . 
  they chose military escalation instead , and it 's them who are guilty in all those deaths . 
  not russia , not putin . 
   with russian guns and russian military leadership there is no proof to that . 
   and just because we refused russia 's offer on the missiles did not mean that we thought of them as an antagonist so you build a missile shield around the country , say that it has nothing to do with said country but refuse offer of joint work , and still expect that this would not be considered as an antagonistic move ? 
  yes , if you 're building a freaking missile shield around a country and are saying that it has nothing to do with said country , some friendly action would be really helpful to , you know , support those words . 
  i 'm talking about kosovo 's independence . 
  it was readily accepted despite the lack of , ah , proper procedure . 
  yet somehow crimean referendum was not acceptable . 
   started a civil war in eastern ukraine wait what ? 
  kiev government refused to talk with eastern federalists and started military operation instead , but it 's putin who 's guilty ? 
   the west no longer sees russia as a neutral power the west never did . 
  it was crystal clear from the moment nato refused russia 's offer to work on the missile defense together . 
  oh , please enlighten me how crimean events of nineties were ` debunked ' . 
   what is so very special in the way crimea ended up in ukraine ? 
  history and strategical importance of crimea . 
   but that does n't justify the bigger mistake to forcefully return the territory back harming all the people living there directly first , there was almost no harm done besides iirc two or three casualties . 
  second , it 's either this , or nato base in crimea in several years that completely controls russia 's access to black sea . 
   go home , comrade . 
   as far as i 'm concerned your country is not a part of europe anymore  romania huh ? 
  you said something ? 
  it 's interesting that nobody cared about self-determination of crimean people when ukraine land-grabbed crimea and sevastopol in nineties . 
  also , kosovo . 
   we have a good chunk of our territory occupied by russians it 's actually other way around : crimea is finally free from ukrainian occupation . 
  oversimplifying history does n't help to understand things . 
  ukraine , and especially crimea , is not just ` another sovereign country ' . 
  read about how crimea ended up in ukraine , and may be you 'll understand something . 
  i must repeat my question . 
  do you have any ** data ** that confirm this , or you 're just talking out of your ass ? 
  so no evidence besides hearsay . 
   killings motivated by homophobia are not uncommon in russia what . 
  this is a whole new level of bullshit . 
  i can remember probably one or two such cases in last , say , five years . 
  how that 's ` not uncommon ' ? 
   there is evidence that the new `` anti-propaganda '' laws have seriously increased violence against the lgbt community ( including killings ) . 
  do you have any data that confirm this , or you 're just talking out of your ass ? 
  edit : nothing 's better than morning derp, 
  yes it is . 
  first , the article is not about russia , it 's about russian government . 
  second , and more important , `` internet spreads extremism '' and `` internet can be used for spreading extremism '' are two very different ideas . 
  are you aware that there was no pre-ussr ukraine ? 
  \u0418\u043e\u0444\u0444\u0435 \u0410\u041d \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 . '' board of directors consists mostly of economists , managers , engineers and such , i failed to find * one * `` ex-military or security without relevant expertise '' there . 
   disagree . 
  moscow i do n't know anything about moscow , nor do i care . 
  i know though about local situation . 
   were you around at the time ? 
  all that i 'm talking about is either my personal experience or experience of those of my friends/acquaintances whom i can trust in that . 
   now , it is the siloviki who are the mafia . 
  well , where are those ` siloviki ' now ? 
  how come that in nineties everybody in the city knew who 's a boss and to whom you must talk if you want to start business and if you do n't want it to be burnt down to ashes next day , but nowadays all that you need for business is some money for start ? 
   friends of ours were asked for a bribe as their daughter needed urgent admission into a normal public hospital to have a baby . 
  well , that 's an anecdotal evidence against other anecdotal evidence . 
  both of my parents have serious health issues , and for at least ten years they where never asked for bribes . 
   ah , that is why friends keep moving their businesses where possible out of the country . 
  oh , and my friends feel pretty comfortable right there . 
  no , they are not ex-military or s/s . 
  nineties : corruption is everywhere from top to bottom , you hardly can do anything without bribes and/or * connections * . 
  business is synonymous with corruption , tax evading and organized crime . 
  no honest businessman can feel safe from mafia thugs : you 're at least expected to pay for * protection * , and if mafia boss decides that your business should * change ownership * , well ... tough luck . 
  second decade of xxi century : corruption on lower levels is hardly visible ; doctors , policemen and other state-paid workers are actually doing their jobs without bribes at every corner . 
  small to medium business is mostly safe . 
  you can actually plan for several years and more . 
  there are thousands of anti-corruption court cases every year , sometimes targeting very high-level officials . 
  those are very interesting results for policy of ` compromising ownership ' and ` promoting cronyism and corruption ' . 
  actually , [ you can .

   how come only you know about these armoured vehicles ? 
  why is vice not reporting on this ?

  well , people somehow do it just fine , 20k is an average salary here . 
  that 's what i mean , basically , not that it 's a lot of money , but it 's no longer less than other occupations , as it used to be . 
  ( oh , and a decent 1 room apartment here can be had for about 10k / month . 
  it 's not moscow , you know . ), 
  [ definition of numerous ] ( https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/numerous ) : consisting of great numbers of units or individuals the correct word here would be `` four '' . 
  i do * what * again ? 
  that 's pretty hilarious . 
  are you aware that this page you 've linked tells the same thing ? 
  as a teacher , i have to make a couple of corrections : 1 ) it 's no longer low-paying . 
  well , comparatively at least ; of course it guys in big cities will make a lot more . 
  in my city ( and it 's a small city in tambov region , not exactly the wealthiest one ) teachers make about 22k rubles on average , and it 's on par with other jobs in the city . 
  there is also a serious shortage of teachers ; nobody in their right mind would fire a physics or a math teacher unless they want to have a school without one . 
  ( though i do n't think that life safety teachers do n't fall under that category . 
  pretty much anybody could teach that . ), 
  2 ) what 's more important , nobody tells teachers what to say . 
  nobody gathers them and tell : `` well , from this day you should tell kids that the west is bad , liberalism is bad '' , etc. 
  so this kind of mental problem demonstrated by the moscow times is most certainly self-inflicted . 
  ehm , i do n't think you make too much sense ... 
  good example on how to tell good journalism from bad . 
  `` it 's a trend in russian schools that keeps growing . '' what a good journalist should do right after such a claim ? 
  show the data that supports it . 
  not an anecdote . 
   are you aware that visa-free regime does n't give you right to work ? 
  considering the size of their shadow economy , i do n't think that respecting laws is a very common trait in ukraine . 
   it only takes a quick google to find numerous cases of teachers being fired for criticising the government please demonstrate those `` numerous '' cases . 
  after all , it 's just a quick google , certainly it would take only some seconds of your time to post here a search request . 
  could you please stop using vague words and get to the point already ? 
  it seems to me that you 're moving the goalposts . 
  do n't do that . 
  just to be the devil 's advocate , making protests happen is vastly easier than meddling ( or hacking ) an election in the most technologically and otherwise advanced state in the world .

  in other words , houses crumbling away , non-existing roads , etc. , and not merely uncut trees and grass ? 
  of course there were zero distance between german and ussr * borders * , but who cares about that ? 
  the distance between the german forces and the heart of the ussr was increased , and that 's the only thing that matters . 
   there was no actual instance of cavalry attacking tanks , that 's a myth . 
  if you know that , then you also know that while this is a myth , polish army was indeed far weaker than german and did n't stood a chance . 
   there was no such thing as an ` inevitable war ' by august 1939 , what made it possible is the de facto alliance between germany and ussr . 
  what made it possible , actually , was the constant appeasement policy . 
  you 're building an army ? 
  here , take some money , and resources too !, 
  you want a piece of czechoslovakia ? 
  sure , why not !, 
  etc. , etc. , etc. 
  m.-r . pact was an icing on the cake . 
  it did n't come out of the blue . 
   also , if someone on the other side of a barrier state like poland acts aggressively and you 're afraid , you do n't remove the barrier between yourself and agression . 
  huh ? 
  two alternatives : a ) barrier state is competely occupied by the enemy , b ) barrier state is partly occupied by the enemy , and partly by you . 
  the choice is obvious . 
  occupation of poland increased the distance between the germans and the soviets .

  this conversation is a great example how somebody could twist and bend the facts to push their agenda . 
  no one knows , really ? 
  with the fucking cavalry against the tanks , and virtually non-existing airforce ? 
  without the anti-german alliance that uk and france failed to form , the ussr had only two choice : temporal agreement with germany and some additional territory to prepare against the inevitable war , or no agreement with germany and the german army on the ussr 's doorstep . 
  eh , at least in small business and at least in the region i live in ( tambov ) you do n't need any bribes anymore . 
  nobody cares for your little shop or cafe . 
  let 's not pretend that polish army had any chance agains the germans , ussr or no ussr . 
  plans to invade poland were in place long before the m.-r . pact was signed , and nothing would 've changed that . 
  except , you know , that possible anti-german alliance that uk and france failed to create . 
  russians are not real slavs , amirite ? 
  molotov-ribbentrop pact has * everything * to do with previous events . 
  and no , you can repeat it thousand times , but it does not change the historical facts : germany invaded poland and defeated its army without any help from the ussr . 
  do you think such conditions are normal in russia ? 
  they are not . 
  and i 'm fairly sure that with enough effort one could find similar desolate corners in every country . 
  why are you conviently forgetting all the stuff that other countries ( including poland ) did together with the nazis ? 
  not unless people stop pretending that crimean tatars were `` innocent natives '' of crimea and russia had conquered them for the sake of conquering . 
  dude , you 're preaching to the choir . 
  i come from the * oblast * were , long before the occupation of the baltic states , [ the soviets saturated forests with chemical weapons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tambov_rebellion ) in order to kill thousands of peasants who rebelled against them . 
  i 'm not praising the ussr , far from it . 
  what i 'm standing against is the rewriting of the history . 
  no , the ussr was n't `` primarily responsible for starting the wwii '' . 
  either it was the nazis , or all the countries who appeased them and/or were dealing business with them . 
  anybody who tries to single out the ussr for dealing with the nazis is either ignorant or purposefully tries to rewrite history . 
  do n't know about you , but my brain works fast enough to require seconds to remember historical facts , not hours . 
  well , if one really wants to find shit , he will certainly succeed . 
  just do n't pretend that russia is somehow different in that matter to other countries . 
  not together . 
  soviets entered poland when polish army was defeated already or somewhere near that point ; iirc that was about two or three weeks after nazis attacked poland . 
  also , how is that related to the fact that uk and france preferred to bet on the ussr and nazis destroying each other rather than do that alliance thing with the soviets to contain nazis ?

  just a teeny little [ bit . 
  may i ask why would be the ussr `` one of the countries primarily responsible for bla bla bla '' , and not uk and france who refused to sign an anti-german alliance with the ussr when it was offered to them ? 
   it is not about russians who were moved to crimea to live in houses of crimean tatars . 
  found the ukraninan shill . 
  you can take the man out of the ussr , but you ca n't take the ussr out of the man . 
  if even half of this is true , it 's pretty terrifying . 
  the law not being broken by the law enforcers ? 
  k , if u say so, 
   this is russia 's top intelligence and cultural elite . 
  says who ?

  yeah , fat chance , i know . 
  the biggest surprise on the list . 
  we 'd just pick one and start paying them to rule mexico and prevent any spillover of drugs or migrants into russia . 
  i would n't mind that , we would get a country with better climate and just as many mineral resources . 
  and we could invade mexico .

  there was a story back when obama fought against tax cuts written by an upper middle class american making $ 400k who claimed he lived hand to mouth .

  and it 's marginally better than vomit , both russian and uruguayan . 
  yes !, 
  no big changes since the last thread . 
  food 's still more expensive , local cheese still sucks . 
  i could n't buy a sofa i wanted because the factory no longer had any upholstering fabric in stock and all their suppliers went out of business . 
  the network 's reaction is not unusual , what 's been completely unexpected was the original u-turn statement :  in april 2012 , kiselyov infamously said on live television that gays should be prohibited from donating `` blood , sperm , and other vital organs . '' in the event that a homosexual person dies in a car accident , he even advocated `` burying or burning '' their heart , `` as it is unfit for extending anyone 's life , '' suggesting that sexually transmitted diseases in the gay community pose too great a risk . 
   on his tv show this week , kiselyov told viewers , `` we can manage to make life easier for adults who want -- both informally and formally -- the responsibility of taking care of each other . 
  in the end , love works wonders , and who 's against that ? '' kiselyov also stated plainly , `` the lgbt community is a fact . '', 
  a strange choice for russia .

  those taxi drivers who sold their licenses are n't taxi drivers no more . 
  i doubt current ones preferred to shell out 300k instead of getting one for free . 
  there 's a difference . 
  when state-owned taxi companies went tits up in the early 90 's , the market organized itself around a very uber-like model , though it took it at least 10 years to do so . 
  i agree that the french model is unsustainable , but uber 's `` tough luck , cabmen '' approach is deplorable . 
  you ca n't just fuck the taxi drivers over , since it were n't them who came up with current rules . 
  the authorities should find a compromise despite both parties demanding opposite extreme solutions . 
  maybe all italians look gay to you , like all europeans look good to americans ? 
  if only . 
  you think that 's bad ? 
  russia is a segment within news from ukraine on every fucking channel here . 
   a teacher in primary school made erotic photos and videos of his naked wife ( also teacher ) inside school building ( after the classes , w/o any public ) and published them on some amateur site . 
  he got fired . 
  this was six years ago , now he was named as new director in this school . 
  is his wife still working there ? 
  if yes , how was he allowed to become his wife 's boss ? 
  she 's not so nice , i have n't seen her give anyone a warm smile , ever . 
  awww . 
  they even bent the bars to get him out . 
  here they would 've chopped the little guy in half with a shovel to get him out .

  in latvian the king of pop is `` maikls d\u017eeksons '' , while in czech he 's `` michael jackson '' . 
  `` majkl d\u017eekson '' in latin serbian , `` michael jackson '' in croatian ( at least according to wikipedia ) . 
  a keyboard will be a huge problem . 
  i do n't know how serbians cope , but when i made a keyboard layout to test my latinisation of russian , i first put the letters in the traditional russian order , jcukeng\u0160\u015czh and so on . 
  when i tried to type something , my brain fucking exploded . 
  i touch type , so when my eyes saw latin letters , my fingers switched to qwerty and gibberish came out . 
  i then made a qwerty-based layout , but there 's the problem of fitting 31 letter where only 26 existed before . 
  i 've come up with a similar latin version of russian , having tried to make it both readable and unambiguous . 
  my only fear is that latinised russian will start to absorb english words without adjusting their spelling . 
  do n't . 
  it turns sticky very quickly and is a pain to wash off . 
  there was one iconic label back in the ussr , so everyone is copying it .

   home made liqueur oh , yes . 
  vodka/scm/nescafe = baileys irish cream . 
  here in russia sweetened condensed milk is extremely common . 
  it 's used for its original purpose in places like the army where it 's hard to provision so much milk . 
  most people use it as a sweet sauce , pouring it on pancakes or * syrniki * . 
  my wife adds it to her morning coffee . 
  back in soviet times it was common to boil a can of condensed milk to give something sweet to your kids , so now there 's all sorts of confectionery that has a `` boiled condensed milk '' flavour . 
  it probably tastes like childhood to some , but it tastes like poverty to me .

  besides north korea i can not imagine any other country banning import of food - and north korea threatening with its nuclear weapons almost daily so i would n't be surprised if kremlin will start to do the same . 
  false dmitry did n't change anything , no heritage left after him so there are not much emotions around his name .

  similar incident near japan . 
  note : these airplanes were [ designed to bear nuclear weapons ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tupolev_tu-95 ) . 
  i believe you misunderstood situation : gazprom has stopped delivery of gaz in may and it turned out company is not profitable without ukraine as a client . 
  i have to apologize - gazprom did not lost 80 % of profit , in q2 it [ lost whole profit and 7.5 b rubles ~ 200m euros on top of that ] ( http://www.rosbalt.ru/business/2014/08/13/1303453.html ) ( compared to 57b rubles / 1.5 b euros profit a year ago ) . 
  i see wrong usage of quotes : instead of `` invades ukraine '' they should be used on `` aid '' term . 
  few days ago gazprom and [ vneshtorgbank ] ( http://www.banki.ru/news/lenta/?id=7021152 ) have published financial results of q2 . 
  without ukraine and its money they lost 75-80 % of profitability . 
  there is metric ton of articles about possible jewish roots of malusha and vladimir in google - [ this one for example ] ( http://poiskpravdy.com/otkuda-est-poshel-knyaz-vladimir-i-kto-ego-nadoumil-rus-krestit/ ) . 
  or [ this ] ( http://freakopedia.ru/wiki/%d0%9c%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%83%d1%88%d0%b0_%e2%80%94_%d0%b5%d0%b2%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b9%d0%ba%d0%b0 ) . 
  by the way there was a nation on the territory of modern russia - [ khazars ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khazars ) - who have converted to judaism in viii century . 
  there is not a single statement with `` jewish '' word in it . 
  probably because orthodox church can sue people and organizations for blasphemy . 
  russian language use `` familiarized '' forms of `` formal '' names . 
  `` formal names '' are used to communicate with people whom you barely know or want to express your respect - or exactly the opposite ( to show you are not happy with their behavior if a person is familiar ) . 
  when a person is familiar or loved then `` familiarized '' form is used . 
  for common jewish name malka familiarized form is malusha ( in fact `` malka '' sounds rude in russian ) - which is the name of vladimir 's mother . 
  neither `` malka '' nor `` malusha '' are n't russian/slavic names and afaik from thousand + years of history of russia `` malusha '' appears only once - as the name of vladimir 's mother . 
  edit : there are no historical documents which states `` vladimir and/or his mother was jewish '' . 
  if i was vladimir or his descendant i 'd destroy such documents to not to compromise myself as pureblood russian ruler - and i would n't be surprised if someone did exactly this . 
  however if today i 'll meet a woman with name malka or malusha i do n't need historical documents to assume she is jewish ( until proven otherwise ) . 
  what particular part are you interesting in ? 
  about malusha as a `` slavic '' form of malka ( other examples : maria =  masha , natalia =  natasha , pavel =  pavlusha , aleksei =  alesha ) - or malka as jewish name ? 
  edit : here is [ an article ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9c%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%83%d1%88%d0%b0 ) about her in russian wikipedia . 
   mother : malusha malusha = form of malka , common jewish name which mean `` queen '' in hebrew . 
  a lot of people do not believe in kgb 's revolt in 1991 ( conspirators were scared shitless and did n't look like conspirators at all - more like hostages who were forced to play the role ) so there is conspiracy theory : he voluntarily gave up ussr to politburo / yeltsin 's gang for them to privatize the country while west could declare they 've won cold war . 
  it 's all very controversial . 
  [ vladimir * the great ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_the_great ) baptized kievan rus , but used it to usurp power and to kill his political opponents in the process + it seems he was jewish ( his mother 's name was malka , she was n't `` royalty '' ) so there is some antisemitism around his name . 
  some people does not like figure of genghis khan : he killed almost half of population but mongols can be considered creators of russian state . 
  [ alexander nevski ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_nevsky ) has rejected offer of western states to remove tatars and adopt catholicism but in return tatars turned his dynasty into rulers of newly created russian state + orthodox church declared him a saint . 
  [ ivan the terrible ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivan_the_terrible ) conquered lots of territories but after his rule country fell apart and there was a century of anarchy . 
  [ nikolas ii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicholas_ii_of_russia ) is a saint but lost russian empire . 
  \\* vladimir the great `` technically '' was born on the territory of modern ukraine ( moscow appeared 250 + years later ) . 
  so even his link to rufed can be questionable to some people . 
  must be either * lenin * ( for destroying russian empire and following century of chaos ) or * yeltsin * / * gorbachev * ( for destroying ussr and following decades of chaos ) . 
  compared to these other historical personalities are n't exactly hated - history of rufed is too controversial ( for example tataro-mongols have created/united russian provinces into state - but killed nearly 50 % of population in the process ) . 
  ( stalin can not be considered native to russian federation , he was born on territory of modern georgia ), 
  guys in kremlin are destroying rufed more effectively than any external enemy could . 
  perhaps we should be grateful to them for their hard work ... 
  it 's not `` my '' country - my ethnic roots and location does not make rufed `` my country '' automatically . 
  also from what i 've seen i doubt it can/should be called `` a country '' at all : after annexation of crimea it does n't even operate within internationally recognized borders . 
  what flag would you suggest for ethnic russian living in rufed ? 
  that 's ok , almost nobody has used the roofs anyway . 
  i 'm `` afraid '' dear leader will remove migrants from the country so muscovites will have to work as low wage workers themselves ( it may actually kill the economy because ~ 10 millions foreign migrants are ~ 20 % of work force ) . 
  now i wonder - what sanctions against population of russia will be implemented by dear leader to punish us for this heinous crime against his state ? 
  lenin mausoleum : +500 % glorious leaders ' birth rate in the world ; -2 golds , food , production per turn per square ; negative population growth rate for 100 years ; +80 % happiness ; inability to adopt free trade / capitalism , liberalism , free speech , democracy civics ; +1 free rocket scientist in each city ; double speed of production of military units ; 50 % more food production with serfdom . 
  levada is n't too reliable . 
  often i hear jokes about them like `` it could be nice if their interviewers have started to ask opinions of people * outside * of kremlin walls '' . 
  also `` 80 % approval rating '' in reality means `` 20 % openly disagree , others are n't sure or agree '' - among people i know nobody think `` ukrainian adventure '' will have positive effect for the country but exactly the opposite and most think putin has made huge mistake thinking georgian-moldovan `` peacekeeping invasion '' scenario could work in a country with 45m population . 
  it seems there are separatists in konigsberg / kaliningrad also - which is surrounded by nato countries . 
  not to mention suppressed civil war ( s ) on caucasus + freshly acquired crimea with 200k very unhappy tatars and almost million of ethnic ukrainians + tatarstan itself is somewhat volatile . 
  iraq ? 
  you mean russian federation is n't superpower equal to us - but aggressive authoritarian second world state with ( real ) weapons of mass destruction ? 
  `` see what us did [ so we are allowed to do the same or worse ] '' is a common argument of kremlin supporters . 
  constitution is inherited from ussr - which fell apart . 
  apparently `` multinational nation '' part does n't work - fsb have to kill people daily on caucasus and government pay billions to chechnya every year just to keep rufed in a single piece . 
  interesting information . 
  thanks !, 
  however i 'm not surprised - russia is n't exactly the place where the most disciplined people live . 
  also there is not much respect for the government . 
  like once i was in a police station and said something like `` but putin issued the law '' and got reply `` we do n't care what putin does , we have instructions '' . 
  correct , there is no single nation within rufed . 
  lately even russians do n't want to be in the same state with other russians within rufed - and they demand separate set of laws ( `` federalization '' events in siberia and kaliningrad ) . 
   country-invading nation . 
  while i 'm agree in vodka part ( what happened with your bear ? ), 
  it 's difficult not to use `` country-invading nation '' term for a country which is involved into 4 + military conflicts during just 23 years since its creation ( georgia , moldova , ukraine , civil wars in caucasus region ) . 
  add kiev maybe ? 
  and minsk . 
  russian government use monopoly on tv , newspapers , radio to manipulate public opinion as they please . 
  public is too weak to resist and eat everything this government has to offer including obviously destructive actions which are against everyone 's interests in the long run - like training chechens to fight against georgians in abkhazia just for the very same chechens to become `` freedom fighters '' and kill thousands rufed soldiers few months later . 
  or starting 3 wars in neighbor countries to prevent them from joining more developed nato and eu . 
  or pursuing idea of `` pax ~ ~ communist ~ ~ plutocratic russia '' instead of joining/enjoying `` pax americana '' . 
  russian government was n't democratically elected and does not rely on population in anything so their policies does not reflect interests and opinions of the population . 
  in fact government mostly ignores interests of population . 
  with dashcams . 
  reddit 's opinion about russia heavily depend on amount of newly opened pro-russian accounts and rt propaganda consumed by visitors of / r/worldnews, 
  apparently chess is an extreme sport . 
  ** russia ** , it seems western sanctions have started to work . 
  at least that part which allowed `` rosneft '' to demand $ 45b bailout .

  it has increased from 1500 + cars ~ 1 month ago . 
  ussr as state did n't go anywhere . 
  it was modified - partially to support myth how west has won cold war ( instead of ussr 's management decided to privatize natural resources ) - but right now those modifications are being reverted because government 's goals were achieved . 
  it 's still the same aggressive state as it was 30 years ago - but weaker . 
  at the moment full `` unofficial '' prohibition to leave the country is covering fsb ( ~ 30k people ) , police ( ~ 1m ) , army ( 220k officers ) , president 's `` management company '' ( 100k ) , various bureaucrats ( ~ 1m ) . 
  they will not be prohibited to re-enter the country but their career may end . 
  afaik russian entry visa is among the most difficult visas to obtain . 
  once you are inside it 's not that difficult if you follow relatively simple rules ( carry copies of papers with you and register in new place during 3 days after arrival ) . 
   could you explain why russia would restrict entry into their own country from russian citizens ? 
  it look like the state is preparing for a war while corruption is its corner stone and it 's rightfully afraid bureaucrats will be bought by foreign intelligence if they leave the country for a day . 
   i ca n't comprehend how a country could restrict travel in their own country . 
  it 's actually very easy part : it happens because rufed is not a country but an empire which consist of multiple semi-independent states ( colonies ) without direct bureaucratic communications with each other and very poor informational infrastructure .

christian values ... sure , you are ready that i 'll say : family values . 
  right you are . 
  but this is only on the surface and just one of the consequences . 
  the modern west does not want to now the concept of sin . 
  there are no more sin or sinful . 
  just - legal or illegal - that 's what counts . 
  you are allowed and ok to do everything within the current legislation . 
  but if this is within the leaky law - you 're ok . ( should i continue with very political incorrect examples ? 
  / s ) ( step upper ) what is the sin ? 
  sin in religions - is not obeying the moral rules ( note , all the religions are about the moral rules , this is their meaning and purpose ) . 
  ( one more step ) in classic christianity ( orthodox , catholic - i have to mention , because some of the protestants have rejected the following ) -- man has a free will . 
  it is very important concept for the christianity . 
  just because you have a free will granted by god , it 's for you to decide - steal or not to steal , murder or not to murder - there from comes the difference between the sin or purity . 
  ( without your ability do choose there can not be sin ) . 
  what do post-christian west have now ? 
  it is throwing the ` sin ' out with the ` free will ' . 
  sure , they are closely connected . 
  and free will is not only in doing , also in thinking . 
  and now - smb is even not allowed to have opinions , that differ from the legislation approved . 
  ( or from the majority , excuse my french ) . 
  smb is deprived of his own free will . 
  - resume : post-christianity deprives the people of freedom . 
  not who . 
  what . 
  christian values . 
  ( thus - the european civilization ), 
  influence of the western post-christianity .

  sure , less chances . 
  more money in moscow , so the manufacturers prefer to bring it here .

   oil crash that is the main point , i think . 
  everything imported just became two times more expensive here . 
  the ruble is still tied to the oil price . 
   life changing decisions should not be made by a ( highly volatile ) simple majority that 's right . 
  i fully agree . 
  but it is democracy , alas . 
  elections of some president is the same thing - it can be a life changing decision . 
  and i would go further - the more sophisticated the issue the less people are able to make a right decision , so the majority would be wrong . 
  ( nobody is making a poll on how to heal the person - it 's for doctors to decide / s ), 
  and our troops were entering . 
  name it as you want . 
  i envy czechs . 
   deficit of good one not a deficit . 
  but it is capitalism - so the price depends on supply/demand . 
  they started making hard cheeses here not long ago . 
  much more we have than year ago , but still the manufacturers can afford to keep rather high prices . 
  smuggling is about making profit . 
  you can say that caviar is deficit - with the same reason . 
  smuggling is a sort of business . 
  we have decent food . 
  and cheese also can be good . 
  and can be bad . 
  as in england , us and everywhere , i suppose . 
  depends on the price . 
  about bullshitting - when you have visited russia ? 
  to rely on your experience , not propaganda articles ? 
   the samples of the equipment passed all necessary tests and corresponded to the standards . 
  but later , as the investigators say , the actual head of the company aeroservis llc decided to reduce the cost of this equipment and make a profit , so he went to the trick . 
  implementing the plan , the suspect in the period from january 1 , 2015 to july 2016 organized the production and sale of air purifiers without equipping the above equipment with the necessary cleaning catalysts and other details , in the absence of which their use does not have a bactericidal effect on airborne viruses and bacteria . 
  as a result , in the specified period of time , falsified equipment was delivered to clinics in over 100 cities and other settlements of the russian federation, 
  that 's funny how much more europeans care about navalny than we are / s, 
   even our cheese is much better that the shit the `` superpower '' produces . 
  cheese differs . 
  ( as i am sure it is in ukraine ) . 
  we have good one also . 
  starting from about $ 10 for the kilo . 
   why not just start a company that makes great cheese but many did so after the sanctions begun . 
  really . 
  i can see it while shopping . 
  big difference in three years . 
  even some italians quickly came here and started the local production . 
  sure we would not try to teach ukrainians about smuggling . 
  as everywhere . 
  you can found the same in london . 
  but you can get real and good russian made . 
  it is just two times more expensive . 
  not much . 
  what is causing pain here - are the oil prices . 
  they differs . 
  yes , if you pay 5 $ for a kilo of cheese - it would be bad . 
  the good one starts from about 10 $ .

  : s as for stalin , you seem to be including every prisoner , including those who were criminals and including those who survived the camps , which was the majority . 
  i wo n't go into the famine business as stalin could not control the weather and was not directly responsible for mismanagement by authorities , but i 'm aware that some people still blame him for it . 
  so for the sake of the argument , let 's add the 7 million in as well . 
  i 'm not sure how forced resettlement = stalin kills . 
  so we have : 7 million from famine 1 million executions ( not all innocent , not all political , but let 's keep the lot ) 1.5 million died in camps ( overestimation assuming half of prisoners died ) 300k outside of ussr , again overestimation . 
  ____________ total of 9.8 million ( 2.8 without counting the famine as there is no consensus on how many of those can be attributed to stalin 's policies ) so taking your figures , which i overestimated , 9.8 million deaths for stalin . 
  27 million soviet only for hitler . 
  feel free to research how many more millions from other countries . 
  seems hitler killed at the very least 3 times as many people as stalin , and in reality a lot more . 
  almost 30 million soviets died in ww2 , more than half of them being civilians . 
  stalin most certainly did not kill 12 % of the population , he executed just under a million and sent another 3 million to camps during the purge . 
  some of those were for political reasons . 
  does n't feel very nice , does it ? 
  do n't worry , over time it will be like water off a duck 's back . 
  thats his nom de guerre , real name is mihail . 
  he is a ukrainian with georgian background . 
  i do n't think the war is about pan slavism , the divide is linguistic and political , not really racial . 
  different soldiers . 
  the ones who were captured are later taken to donetsk . 
  no , hang on , it has other videos after it , some contain dead bodies from firefights , then there 's some random `` russia in syria '' news reels . 
  it 's that old video of givi , a ukrainian separatist yelling at ukrainian forces and making them chew their epaulettes . 
  it was terrible . 
  you ca n't use the fight for equality to justify murder of children . 
  what do you think armenia needs to do to resolve the nagorno-karabakh conflict ? 
  are both sides in a forest of denial ? 
  ps : release a new album already !, 
  what is dead may never die . 
  economically , it 's a lot better . 
  but one thing that people often forget about is the overall state of the country in the 90s . 
  criminality was massive , `` mafia '' pretty much controlled everything . 
  in fact , most 90s oligarchs rose up by either paying the mobsters protection money or being heads of various mobster groups . 
  as a result , you could not conduct business , even small business , without being involved with the mob , and the constant power struggles left many people dead , sometimes even civilians as collateral damage . 
  that lawlessness , which i consider to be the worst element of the 90s , has stopped . 
  that was good , funny , without unnecessary xenophobia and hatred . 
  congratulations on your long and often challenging journey to independence , latvia !, 
  -1 for brezhnev failing to kiss latvia on the cheek . 
  whole of russian empire existed as many little states during the civil war . 
  ukraine was divided in parts too . 
  i 'm sure they have rifles available , but the bears are protected , so shooting them is a last resort , if a scientist 's life is in danger for example . 
  in his interview he said that he was a soldier during the second chechen war . 
  then he worked in police for some years and then came to donbas in january 2015 . 
  so a russian volunteer , not a serving soldier . 
  there were nowhere as many western ukrainian villagers in kiev before recent years . 
  they look so alike as well !, 
  so hitler ... did nothing wrong ? 
  the famine was caused by a draught and affected ukraine , kazakhstan and russian ssr . 
  it 's effect was worsened even more by regional officials inflating produce numbers to look good in front of moscow and thus delaying supply of aid to the affected regions . 
  unless stalin controlled the weather , you ca n't blame everything on him . 
  he is responsible as far as failing to control the situations and providing timely aid though , but we ca n't estimate the number of deaths caused by that with any accuracy . 
  as for the rest , he executed almost 1 million people and sent about 3 other million to working camps during the purges , many of whom died either in camps or later in life from poor health as a result of their imprisonment . 
  many of those were indeed innocent , and i even consider those who politically opposed him as innocents as they did not deserve execution / imprisonment for disagreeing with the communist theory . 
  many were just ordinary , non political criminals though . 
  why is n't hitler responsible for combat deaths in ww2 ? 
  if he did n't start the war , those people would n't have died from his actions . 
  he is responsible for every person who died fighting nazi germany . 
  well , holodomor deaths were caused by a drought and economic mismanagement , not by anyone 's intention . 
  but even if you count those ~ 8 million deaths in ussr during that time , that still does n't come close to hitler 's body count . 
   since stalin killed even more people of hitler well , he did n't . 
  hitler is responsible for almost 30 million soviet deaths , and that 's just one country . 
  stalin was nowhere near that . 
  unless you are talking about how many people they personally killed with their own hands , in which case , i guess stalin did kill more due to his terrorist past . 
  it 's good that it clarified that he is russia 's , for a second i thought it may have been liechtenstein 's putin . 
  as the saying goes `` you reap what you sow '' . 
  here 's shariy 's video of the `` siege '' , you can skip the intro if you do n't speak russian or do n't like him : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvpk0h4m24y, 
  you come off as a bitter , unaccomplished person . 
  your anger consumes you . 
  it will be good for the people of both countries to improve relations , it ca n't happen overnight , but it will happen over time . 
  baltic countries did join ussr , under duress and under threat of military action . 
  it 's not occupation , occupation is when a country gets taken over by the military and is occupied without annexing the country to the invading state . 
  in practical terms there is little difference , of course , but if we are debating proper legal interpretation , then that 's the distinction . 
  also , i do n't believe it was illegal at the time under international law , all our current law which deals with such issues came after ww2 . 
  even war of aggression was not illegal before the un charter . 
  i 'm not arguing that the annexation was the right thing to do btw , i think it was wrong and should not have happened . 
  i even think it was against the interests of ussr , but that 's a highly debated topic in itself . 
  in practical terms , ussr annexed baltics . 
  they threatened the governments to let troops in first , then exiled the government officials then held a rigged vote to join them to ussr . 
  yeah it was an invasion and annexation . 
  occupation would be if there was an invasion and no annexation . 
  i suppose in practical terms , an annexation which is not welcomed is not that different to an occupation . 
  we have the great patriotic war and then a soviet-japanese war , it 's appropriate to divide the two as they were not fought at the same time and are different conflicts from our perspective . 
  there 's nothing sinister about it , ussr was n't really affected directly by 1939-1941 part of ww2 , for us the war started in 1941 when we were invaded . 
  and then after we defeated germany , we started another war with japan . 
  we were not at war with japan during great patriotic war . 
  well , ussr lost almost 30 million people in the war , most of them being civilians . 
  every family has had someone take part in the war and most families have lost someone . 
  countries which were not so affected may not care about it so much anymore , but we do . 
  it 's kinda like asking a jewish person why are they so preoccupied with the holocaust or a black american person why are they so preoccupied with slavery . 
  i tried watching the video , but it 's lagging badly at the moment , i might try it later when others are not using the internet . 
  nevzorov is an interesting persona , and has done some great journalism work , but he has his biases which show in his work , so a lot of people have problems with him because of that . 
  he really is polarising , for example he is patriotic and says many things other patriots would agree with , but then on certain issues he goes against the typical patriotic view , for example chechen war . 
  i guess that shows that he has his own views , whether right or wrong , and does not just follow the popular opinion . 
  not really , they were separate wars which happened in the context of ww2 . 
  ussr was at war with neither germany , nor britain or france during that time , so were not in ww2 until 1941 . 
  there was no military alliance with germany , so ussr was never allied with them . 
  you are producing some badhistory content . 
  i suggest you take a step back and look at things objectively because it 's really not doing you any good to hold onto historically incorrect opinions . 
  ussr was never germany 's ally . 
  they opposed each other in the 30s and the pact itself was a way to postpone their war with each other and prepare . 
  soviet invasion of poland and winter war were separate events . 
  ussr entered ww2 in 1941 when germany broke the pact prematurely ( stalin expected war to start later ) , by that stage the war was well underway .

such is the russian mentality are you judging the whole nation just by one girl 's opinion ? 
  really ? 
  not just near border but i was in kiev , ukraine and saw no diffrence at all with my city located far from the border . 
  the same people , surroundings , culture . 
  you really could not distinguish ukrainian from russian . 
  i went with 2 my american friends they have similar opinion . 
  they are n't conscripts , they signed contract by their own will . 
  did anyone actually read the link ? 
  would not eat it raw but cured salmon is totally my weakness . 
  in russia we have a lot of ukrainian , latvian , armenian and moldovanian celebrities - singers , actors , comedians etc. 
  i would even say half of showbusiness are from there . 
  most of them acquire russian citizenship in the process . 
  you guys went totally crazy with your hatred . 
  i guess soon there will no left any russian on this subreddit despite how much it would be liberal and pro-european person . 
  why you attack me with that ? 
  where in my initial comment you saw any approval of such behaviour ? 
  i love germans , though i could also say they have killed half of my family , but i do n't generalize them unlike you do with us . 
   zombifying 90 % russian population that statement could come only from itself zombified person that believes all russians some crazy rednecks, 
  so silly , hope germans do n't take it too seriously, 
  i am still here , it works fine for me, 
  true , it needs repair . 
  well at least it is my own , and hope one day it will contribute to pruchase for my new good apartament, 
  haha , hi drive me crazy so far though when he sleeps he is an angel so i forgive him everything, 
  he waved his paw and said : `` hi , love you too , estie ! '', 
  i believe it is up to individuals decide which and what kitty they want and are willing to adopt and care many years . 
  i am not sure total complete disappearance of purebreed is an option, 
  sorry i dont live in luxury house, 
  do they feel connection with france ? 
  done  is there possibility to create own categories like here with subreddits ? 
  oy you are right , bunny . 
  yeah they look scary , just an example , it is common here to use animals nouns with added diminutive suffixes as endearment words . 
  what are yours ? 
  looks interesting , will try it, 
  lol :d will try to translate to what these words are more similar by meaning : \u041c\u0438\u043b\u044b\u0439 - nice , \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u043c\u044b\u0439 - beloved , \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0439 - darling , \u043c\u043e\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c - my joy , \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043a\u0430 - rabbit in diminutive form , \u043a\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043a - kitten , \u043c\u0430\u043b\u044b\u0448 - baby , \u0437\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0446\u0435 - little gold , \u0441\u043e\u043b\u043d\u044b\u0448\u043a\u043e - sun in diminituve form , \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043a - hippo in diminutive form . 
  it is very board in russian language , there are a lot of endearment words , basically can be any noun in diminutive form or nice meaning adjective . 
  well russian offensive insults go even further, 
  there is a full detalization of cities with exact timing , just scroll down a bit, 
  well that is what i talked about , there is tendency to exaggerate everything related with russia . 
   ones russia likes to cry about the most then from where did you get that ? 
  i would say that is how some media is trying to portray our attituide toward you , i did n't hear that estonia was much circulated in russian news . 
  main russian antagonist is usa . 
  and even latvia - only in context of `` what are russophobic '' in collective term pribaltica . 
  but there are bunch of jokes based on stereothype of estonian slowness % ), 
  serbia is adorable here , 
  as from nation that constantly gets a lot of bashing i feel exactly opposite , because of empathy . 
  hope greeks will find a way from this situation, 
  so are slavs ( poles , czechs , slovaks , serbs etc ) europeans or not ? 
  because majority of russia are slavic people that live mostly in european part of russia , while other land is cold and uninhabited, 
  i saw many times phrase here - something kind of `` if we all are under one umbrella we should bear all together '' in the sense if one country of eu would get trouble ( with aggression , sanctions etc ) so all should back it . 
  so why in greece case it is different ? 
  need to be together in sorrow and in joy , 
  oh those sweet neighborhood feuds . 
  got it , thanks, 
  how so ? 
  i thought we are neighbours with usa via alaska . 
  i would not say that mexica gets tons of benefits from usa still being such poor state with such rich neighbor, 
  in russian : yes = \u0414\u0430 , no = \u041d\u0435\u0442 , and as bonus do n't know = \u041d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e, 
  ukrainian and chechen , how ironic, 
  first what came in my mind it is kid 's song [ the forest raised a christmas tree ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfeiwc81fqu ) . 
  it was very popular on every new year in my childhood . 
   by ethnic russians . 
  it looks like it is [ not true ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yjmruka.jpg ) and in general all caucasus republics are very homogeneous , just simply because of its culture and way of life that very contradicts to windy russian lifestyle , ordinary russian would find those places too conservative and religous/islamist to move there . 
  actually dagestan is one of most `` pro-russian '' republic in russia among others muslim regions . 
  judging by their vk groups they all speak russian as a main language , it is something that make possible communication between various etnicites of caucasus . 
  15 seconds guys , 15 seconds , a moment . . 
  airspace is not a road with straight pathes , roadbeds and signs , it happens when one can just touch other 's space accidently , you knew there was war zone , so jets are flying for a reason . 
  you just killed both of pilots and you hail it . 
  i am not angry or anything i am just deeply frustrated by your reaction . 
  mostly true . 
  there are of course some differencies but they are very distinct and probably unheard of to foreigner 's ear . 
   `` eu national '' i think it is a bit different than european national . 
  eu = / = europe, 
  it is not russia decided first communism could be fun but germany, 
  they are actual . 
  i picked them up from various albums , time and cities . 
  well as a woman i would tend to disagree , in reality i believe problems in our men rather are more in their backward personality than in their appereance . 
  it is just selective perception plus more pics of girls than men on the internet, 
  would be so kind to elaborate ? 
  bad with english :(, 
  here are more : [ instagram of russian police ] ( https://instagram.com/russianpolice/ ) and [ vk ] ( http://vk.com/album-24732375_176961555 ) group, 
  probably need to mention that trend to hire young people and especially give places to women came not so long ago , after police reorganization in 2011 when a lot of old and incompetent employees were fired . 
  i know what are you taliing about , my greatmother was polish ( wierchowski last name ) , and my grandfather was a [ victim of stalin regime ] ( http://nekropole.info/en/person/view?id=1112422 ) . 
  so yes , i do believe russia should find ways try to compensate what it had done . 
  oh i am so sorry i mistook your flair for britain, 
  well you are one of the first in list who should pay reparations to others not recieve them  it is fate of any former empire, 
  i thought there is world practice of it how these reparation things work ? 
  i am not saying that it will cover all bad what was done but if we can find some solution i would be glad . 
  i know but for the katyn massacre, 
  i am actually all for it . 
  but the problem is if russia will agree to pay it the next day all ex-ussr counties will demand the same . 
  and while i would do support decision with reparations to countries such as estonia , latvia , poland and lithuania , but uzbekistan , tajikistan , kyrgyzstan and others in my opinion have no this right . 
  i would say unofficially it is anti-soviet celebration . 
  this holiday was introduced in order to replace the commemoration of the october revolution , known as the day of great october socialist revolution during soviet period , which formerly took place on november 7 . 
  this decision angered some sections of the public , particularly the communist party , who continued with celebrations on november 7 . 
  i love sleep naked, 
  if anyone wonder what [ russian army choir is ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bybtazjb8qm ), 
  kind of weird to see these news after bunch of jokes `` russians tourists on vacation '' . 
  if i was some of haters of russia i could say that it is karma , but ca n't accept that innocents should die for their government . 
  my mom wanted travel to egypt in recent days but fortunately we delayed it . 
  why so rude ?

  can this be called terrorism ? 
  i do n't see why not . 
  berlin is like a black hole that has destroyed brandenburg . 
  a guy from latvia i know says \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e when you should say \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434 meaning `` ago '' . 
  what do * you * call a shop in ukrainian ? 
  it 's * generally * true . 
  russian urbanisation happened during soviet times , and this meant very high horizontal mobility . 
  you did n't end up in a town next to your village , you ended up in a new city halfway across the country . 
  this erased accents very well . 
  you can still find people with strong regional accents , like [ this one from ne central russia ] ( http://youtube.com/watch?v=sigsgj2q2e0 ) , but that 's unusual , you have to look for norms . 
  another exception is the southern fricative g. it 's not quite a ukrainian g , but it 's closer to it than to the normative one . 
  old moscow russian and st. pete russian sound a bit pretentious . 
   sound like pretentious toffs . 
  `` what ho , srinivasam , what ho ! '', 
  people 's democratic republic of free europe, 
  will there be v\u0101cietis in it ? 
  i am getting `` the last airbender '' vibes from it for some reason , despite not having seen either cartoon . 
  i am getting `` the last airbender '' vibes from it for some reason , despite not having seen either cartoon . 
  those g20 leaders are real pussy magnets . 
  yeah , i 'd rather they used suicide ropes or suicide car exhaust . 
   hsh hiljaa sounds like the battle cry of the red angry bird . 
  she would n't look out of place in / r/hardboltons, 
  but why include \u0446 and \u0447 ? 
  would n't they both be pronounced like / ts / by a finn ? 
  i know finnish has words with / ts / in them , like `` sweden '' . 
  so there 's neither [ final-obstruent devoicing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/final-obstruent_devoicing ) nor [ vowel reduction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vowel_reduction ) in serbian ? 
  interesting . 
  seven ? 
  we have / s / , / s ^ j / , / \u0282 / and / \u0255 / . 
  you have to add all / z / - like sounds if you want to get to seven . 
  although all the jokes that go `` finnish man ko to paar and look mopile phone '' make me think there 's no distinction between voiced and voiceless consonants in finnish . 
  so `` beograd '' does n't sound like `` beograt '' and `` kosovo '' does n't sound like `` kosavo '' at all ? 
  and the * das messer * falls on you , and that 's * das ende * . 
  the rules are fine , it 's the exceptions that kill you . 
   the closest an anglophone can get is with the obscure northern european language called frisian they forgot about scots . 
  they should switch to krokodil , it 's much cheaper . 
  or are cough pills a prescription only medicine in serbia ? 
  the diomedes ? 
  russia 's got you covered there as well . 
  we have n't done any tests there in a long time . 
  and many more . 
  it 's probably the second most irradiated place in europe . 
  package tours to turkey and egypt , or to sochi/crimea if your company has a hotel there ( otherwise the price/quality ratio is too low ) , or maybe renting a room from a local resident . 
  bus tours across europe ( you take a train to brest first ) . 
  or just spend your vacation on your dacha because you ca n't afford anything else . 
  that 's what 90 % of european russians do . 
  replace all foreign countries with china for asian russians . 
  you pay your bank , not visa . 
  visa just handles interbank transactions . 
   `` if he even suggests i should kneel in front of him , i will eviscerate him with the very same sword . '', 
  overcompensating for something . 
  there 's `` fa\u00e7ade '' as well , which is * not * pronounced `` fuck aide '' . 
  such last names are rather uncommon in russia . 
  * polyakov is kinda common , and might mean `` polish '' * kazakov is obviously a `` cossack '' * litvinov means `` belorussian '' * cherkasov means `` ukrainian '', 
  well , at least you literally know it \u043a\u0430\u043a '' \u041e\u0442\u0447\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0448 '' . 
  we have n't invaded any new ones , so you can say we 've stopped * invading * . 
  we 've switched to middle eastern ones , thank you very much . 
  more holdings per province , higher tech and you can holy war them without fabricating claims . 
  nah , you should vote us into nato for the lulz . 
  we 'll even man the military bases all the way to rhein for you . 
  so what reloading actions for shotguns are legal ? 
  break action and lever action ? 
  are kashubians considered ethnic poles or pomeranians ? 
  let 's say you have an idea what at ethnic group is . 
  and then we have a subset of people who belong to these group , but are sufficiently different in one of the aspects and who have managed to preserve their semi-separate identity despite living in the same nation . 
  everyone knows about cossacks , and i decided to skip mixed groups like kamchadals and `` entundred peasants '' . 
  russia 's so big we have many such groups . 
  ** pomors ** pomors are the descendants of the first russians who colonised the shores of white and barents seas . 
  because the land could n't support mass settlement , they were left along for a long time and they could n't assimilate local finnic populace completely . 
  they are much more sea-oriented than average russians and have a more self-sufficient and independent culture . 
  ** chaldons ** no one quite knows who chaldons are . 
  they live in western siberia , look more or less slavic , speak russian , but locals know there are regular russians and there are `` yellowbellies '' , there even used to be separate villages in the past . 
  one theory says they 're russians whose ancestors had arrived in siberia well before ivan the terrible annexed the siberian khanate . 
  ** various groups of the steppe frontier ** the lands that are now on our border with central and eastern ukraine used to be a vast no man 's land between the relatively safe principalities of moscow and friends and the steppes of the golden horde . 
  there are multiple groups that live or lived there . 
  some are probably autochthonous , like * ~ ~ super ~ ~ sayans * , whose ancestors gradually pushed the cumans out , but were stranded there when the mongols came . 
  some , like ** tsukans ** , are the descendants of northern serfs . 
  some like * odnodvortsy * , or `` single householders '' , were yeomen who were sent there to settle the newly reclaimed frontier and protect it from the tatars . 
  most of these groups have all but disappeared in the 20th century after collectivisation and urbanisation . 
  ** old believers ** there are multiple small groups of old believers who have first tried to settle in the swampy lands of upper dnieper or the forests beyond middle volga , but were deported to siberia by the emperors/empresses . 
  they now live in the altay mountains and transbaikalia and comprise such groups as ** kerzhaks ** , ** semeyskie ** ( familials ) and ** kamenshchiki ** ( stony river settlers ) . 
  like all old believers , they shun reformed believers , or `` nikonians '' ( they have separate utensils for infidel visitors ) , avoid vodka and are much more industrious than average russians . 
  for that they have suffered greatly during collectivisation , but villages of old believers survive even now . 
  if you take a look at these cossacks ( i think they are kuban cossacks ) , you 'll see a mix of ukrainian and caucasian moves . 
  because they will have to pay the people back for all the cancelled tours . 
  they ca n't exactly tell people `` go ask putin for your money back '' . 
  even if they 'll pay a percentage of the original price , it will destroy their cash flow . 
  our tourism industry is gon na crash and burn . 
  i checked the handwriting exercise book for primary schools . 
  have you been to the mertvovod canyon ? 
  most of russia is hard to reach . 
  [ pupu ner pillars ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikdjffnr8ga ) are a good example . 
  kamchatka trails are beatiful as well , but getting there is oh so expensive . 
  broad-nibbed pens demand special calligraphy . 
  same here . 
  just checked , and it 's the `` official way '' of writing an 8 in russia . 
  refreshing the tree of liberty . 
  glass is american . 
  your national parks are awesome . 
  it is a small , slippery and overheated tourist trap .

   and you paint the situation as if turkish citizens and state is 7/24 on kurdish hunt , not true . 
  no shit it 's not true . 
  this is why my head hurts from arguing with you . 
  did you know for a fact that you can oppress an ethnicity without 24/7 hunting them ?? 
  in fact , you can hunt them only on saturdays and sundays and it 's still oppression !!!, 
  in fact , you do n't even have to hunt them regularly , you just have to curtail their rights to speak their language , gather as political parties , spend less money on education and infrastructure in their regions , carry out indiscriminate massacres at times and a few other things . 
  oppression is n't black and white . 
  in fact , you can even oppress them without killing them at all . 
  i swear , you either never picked up a history book or just awoken from a time before wwi back when people could be so blissfully ignorant of sociology . 
   but your violent freedom fighting solution will not ever work . 
  where have i advocated violence , are you back to your ` put words into the mouth of your opponent ' technique ? 
   you sound so naive , to believe the minorities can not ever cause problems . 
  you sound like a regular old nationalist racist and anyone in the west will generally agree with me here . 
  thing about being a minority is that you 're in a position of very little power . 
  you get kicked around . 
  but obviously the great turks know how to build a country without needing the liberal lies of the west , such as sociology and human rights !, 
   seems like you are living in the 80ies or something . 
  kurds have all the rights like any other person in turkey . 
  you and the other turkish guy who is replying to me in this thread talks like they 've lived in a cave for the last 70 years . 
  it 's pretty rich of you to accuse me of living in the past when you 're living in even older past . 
  who in 2015 can seriously try to make the argument that ` paper rights ' are the same as actual rights ? 
  newsflash : institutionalised discrimination and marginalisation is a thing . 
  go pick up a sociology and history book about the last 100 years of history . 
  black people had the same rights that white people did since 1865 in the united states . 
  * on paper * . 
  then in [ 1964 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_rights_act_of_1964 ) there was a very important piece of legislation passed that took a * great deal of steps * to ensure that black people were equal * even though they were already equal on paper for 100 years in theory * . 
  and guess what ? 
  black people are still not fully equal in the united states today . 
  it 's actually kinda hard to get equality . 
  especially if you 're not even trying . 
  us has been steadily moving forward in granting more and more equality for the black since 1863 . 
  turkey is n't even trying , especially since the start of the syrian war . 
  you think that paper rights are the same as actual rights ? 
  are you a child , do they not have books in turkey or do you just read whatever confirms your pre-existing biases ? 
  you did n't even read the link i put in my previous post . 
  allow me to quote a passage from it since apparently you 're incapable of perusing a very brief wiki article :  the european commission concludes as of 2006 that `` overall turkey made little progress on ensuring cultural diversity and promoting respect for and protection of minorities in accordance with international standards '' . 
  [ 18 ] the european commission against racism and intolerance ( ecri ) reports that ( as of april 2010 ) : `` the public use by officials of the kurdish language lays them open to prosecution , and public defence by individuals of kurdish or minority interests also frequently leads to prosecutions under the criminal code . 
  '' [ 44 ] from the 1994 briefing at the international human rights law group : `` the problem in turkey is the constitution is against the kurds and the apartheid constitution is very similar to it . 
  '' [ 45 ] the economist also asserts that `` reforms have slowed , prosecutions of writers for insulting turkishness have continued , renewed fighting has broken out with kurds and a new mood of nationalism has taken hold '' , but it is also stressed that `` in the past four years the turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdo\u011fan , improved rights for kurds '' . 
  [ 46 ]  however , due to the recurrence of hostilities between the pkk and the turkish government over the turkey -- isil conflict , a resumption of violence towards ordinary kurdish citizens has occurred . 
  a statement by the kurdish national congress ( knk ) stated : `` the mobs are organizing themselves across social media , forming groups and attacking homes known to belong to kurdish families . '', 
  meanwhile , 128 attacks of hdp offices , a pro-kurdish rights party , have occurred throughout the country . 
  perhaps next time try reading the link i put in my post if you have never read more than a single sentence about the algerian war . 
  makes you look more mature when you do n't make idiotic juvenile sardonic quips like that . 
  algerian war resulted in a lot of people and land being destroyed by the french . 
  that leads to refugees going to other countries . 
  algerians spoke french and france is well-off , so many went there to escape the misery of their own country . 
  also a part of [ algerians were loyalists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harki ) , they also immigrated to france ( or tried to , many were not accepted and massacred in algiers by algerians outraged at their service in the french army that tortured and killed algerians ) . 
  france has a lot of algerians because it used to own algiers . 
  notice that france has few libyans . 
  it did not own libya . 
  perhaps if the french did not wish to have so many algerians they could have refrained from colonising and then brutally fighting the algerian attempts to gain freedom . 
  to be fair , they would have algerians even if they let algeria go . 
  such is the legacy of colonialism . 
  you end up paying for what you broke . 
  even if it was your grandfather that broke it . 
  i guess history is a bitch , it has consequences . 
  i am not stalin , yet there are plenty of users ( mostly balts and poles ) on / r/europe who will attack me as if i was stalin . 
  like i said , consequences of history , it does n't just end when the new generation replaces the old . 
  maybe firstly , you get over your butthurt ? 
  there is no ottoman anymore . 
  it 's a derisive phrase that i use for nationalist turks who deny the issues that their nationalism creates , such as denying that there is a problem with how turkey treats the kurds . 
  erdogan 's foreign policy is often referred to as ' [ neo-ottomanism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neo-ottomanism ) ' ( try reading about your country more from international outlets , that will help you clear your mind from your indigenous propaganda -- you wo n't catch me reading russian news about russia because i know for a fact they 're also all propaganda ) . 
  i 'm not sure why you think * i 'm * butthurt when i use the word ` ottoman ' since the 200 years of imperial russia - ottoman empire relations consisted of russia defeating ottoman empire . 
  i do n't have a historical reason to be butthurt , unless the books you read in turkey rewrote history somehow to turn those defeats into victories ...  you lose your credibility when you refer pkk and affiliated organisations as all the kurds . 
  you 're inventing lost credibility in a vain attempt to redirect the argument . 
  what funny is how archaic you sound . 
  your arguments are straight from 1960s american politics , you 're turkish and probably not well-read in history , but i find it amusing as i recognise your arguments , except they 're so old and cliched that you 'd at least do better and start borrowing more modern ukip/fn line of bullshit if you want to explain away how marginalisation do n't real . 
  see , this is especially clear when you say something as stupid as this :  self education , cultural revolution needed among their society . 
  whenever you hear a racist in the us talk about the `` problem with black people '' they always say that blacks need to educate themselves and improve their culture , because `` black culture is toxic '' . 
  plenty of redditors will agree with this . 
  of course , you can imagine how most normal people respond to bullshit of this scale . 
  it 's laughable how ignorant people are to issues of discrimination in the society . 
  education does n't just magically happen . 
  if a minority is persecuted , they have less of a chance to get the same education that a majority ethnicity does . 
  *** kurds are the sum of all kurds . 
  i never said pkk is all the kurds , you 're just putting words into my mouth . 
  it 's a particularly disaffected extremist party . 
  extremism is a product of extreme conditions if it is on the scale of pkk . 
  why do n't the tatars in the russian tatarstan do a pkk-style guerilla campaign ? 
  why do n't the gagauz turks in moldova do a pkk-style guerilla campaign ? 
  why do minorities in some countries manage to stay peaceful and in turkey you still have a war with the kurds ? 
  [ may it have something to do perhaps with how you treat them ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_of_kurdish_people_in_turkey ) quote :  the european commission concludes as of 2006 that `` overall turkey made little progress on ensuring cultural diversity and promoting respect for and protection of minorities in accordance with international standards '' .

   educated kurds do integrate themselves in the turkish society , do find work and get the benefits of a modern life . 
  pkk ca n't convince people like that to go to the mountains and fight against turkish army . 
  i 'm sure that pkk is fighting because turkey treated the kurds so well that they got sick of the astounding generosity !, 
  kinda like chechens were fighting russia because russia was so generous and progressive but the chechens were filthy backwards savages and they hated the glorious russian civilisation , preferring to wallow in their shit . 
  *** btw , does it amuse you that you 're literally repeating the arguments of every 19th-20th century racist colonialist ? 
  `` the natives that take our ways and become civilised are doing quite well , it 's those filthy uncivilised savages that are the real problem '' -- completely ignoring [ the issues ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_of_kurdish_people_in_turkey ) of marginalisation and oppression that are driving some kurds to look for independence and the creation of their own state on their own lands that they 've wanted for so long . 
  yes , you can make the same racist argument about black people in the us too . 
  except it 's bullshit and i ca n't believe the guy i replied to got upvotes . 
  probably because people did n't notice that biji is kurd , it 's kinda obvious what a turk is referring to when they say that sort of a sarcastic phrase . 
  turkey has one of the worst human rights records in europe especially since it is still continuing unlike some other terrible human rights records ( germany , serbia , etc ) .

  of course no . 
  you should watch less cnn/foxnews/etc . 
  nothing is changing really . 
  right after foxnews . 
  of course they will never ask crimea 's people if they want it . 
  so we 're going to have putin forever . 
  noooo !, 
  conspiracy theory . 
  after nemtsov 's death there was a conflict between fsb and chechens . 
  so putin have to choose side . 
  that 's why he was hiding . 
  i hoped he 's dead . 
  why he ca n't stay dead ? 
  what did you expect from american show ? 
  revolution can only bring extreme poverty for decades . 
  and nothing else . 
  but `` west '' wo n't start to confiscate their property that was bought with dirty money . 
  so all that propaganda will be pointless . 
  west likes money much more than `` ideals '' ,, 
  sweden this time ? 
  yeltsin was a scumbag . 
  i really want to piss on his grave . 
  he does n't deserve anything . 
  i 've really liked entire article . 
  that 's strange . 
  stalin 's support have stared to rise back in 90s . 
  basic idea was `` if stalin was alive then those scumbags who stole everything would be all dead '' . 
  that 's basically all the same for me . 
  why ? 
  he just finished what yeltsin have started . 
  he ca n't exist in another system . 
  it never was alive . 
   in 1996 , russian media magnates and the overwhelming majority of journalists united against the threat of a communist takeover . 
  they acted as a united front in support of president boris yeltsin , who was running for a second term . 
  that 's how `` free press '' have died . 
  they all published craziest brainwashing propaganda possible and showed that their `` freedom of press '' worth nothing . 
  i 'm afraid his home is isis now . 
  i do n't think he will have too much choice in near future . 
  nobody would ask me or anybody else about that . 
  you should know who is going to replace putin . 
   segmentation fault, 
  and they totally forgot about little nasty thing called `` trade '' . 
  you ca n't have prosperous country if you do n't have access to world trade . 
  it 's mostly `` if there were stalin those thiefs and corrupted officials would be executed long time ago '' . 
  important thing that everybody always forget . 
  that should have be done long time ago . 
  instead of that stupid war . 
  90 's are back for real . 
  this thing killed a lot of russians too . 
  so calling it genocide against ukrainians means forgetting about everybody else . 
  yup . 
  that 's why you should n't trust usa . 
  ever . 
  it 's just a consequence of this problem . 
  without being good at wars russia would n't exist today . 
  i would like to sponsor them . 
  that 's awesome . 
  not even near . 
  last time i 've checked it they did n't want my money . 
  dump them right into hands of isis recruiters . 
  some north african countries are n't really a countires for some time . 
  just territories . 
  that 's not state busines . 
  that 's pretty simple - you just do n't change registration . 
  they make it hard so that 's their problems . 
  in worst case you need to pay small fine and that 's all . 
  but usually nobody care . 
   and do you really dislike patriotism ? 
  oh yes !, 
  i have better idea . 
  everything that ends on '' - ism '' is a bullshit . 
  and every idealist is a dangerous psychopath . 
  i want your winter . 
  you can have mine in exchange . 
  people did n't reject that direction . 
  yeltsin did . 
  using tanks as an argument . 
  after that people have n't had any influence anymore . 
  most important is that west totally supported that shit . 
  and now they just do n't trust anybody . 
   from the creation of the nato-russia council in the 1990s but that `` council '' was nothing but pointless talking shop without any power and influence . 
  so they did n't want to integrate russia into western world . 
  they tried to create nice illusion instead . 
  and he totally failed to defend them . 
  idiot . 
   how it protected itself to become the world 's largest country and such ? 
  pretty simple really . 
  you have all those nomads around you who love to raid an kill everybody they can . 
  you destroy them and put their territory under control so they ca n't kill you . 
  then you have another bunch of savages right outside this new territory . 
  and so on . 
  that 's a pretty stupid way to waste money . 
  i love how those letters `` kgb '' make everybody shit bricks . 
  would be fun to call that something absolutely harmless . 
  it does n't matter at all . 
  opposition was banned from elections , thrown in jail and just killed . 
  after that tank show in moscow ? 
  of course not . 
  first and last relatively fair elections in russia were in 1989 . 
  and who died exactly ?

  it 's fucking shitty , i know . 
  the gay law is just a superficial thing . 
  we have hundreds of far more pressing problems -- political , economic , societal , cultural , etc. 
  guess what though ? 
  a good deal of americans on reddit love to circlejerk about how much us sucks -- but the moment a euro says us sucks every american seems to fall on them like vultures . 
  criticism of the us is a privilege of the us redditors . 
  i literally tried posting perfectly identical comments , only difference being in one i implied i was an american and in another i said i was a euro or russian specifically . 
  guess what got upvoted highly and what got showered with abuse and downvoted to hell ? 
  also , can all the yanks brigading this from srd kindly go fuck themselves ? 
  this is one subreddit where i can go to and discuss things with other euros , do you goddamn have to have your nose in * everything * now ? 
  of course you do n't -- just keep jerkin ' about how poor and oppressed americans are on this site and do n't even bother reading any counter-arguments . 
  do go back to / r/adviceanimals and / r/pics if long text-based replies are too tiring to you . 
  nobody forced you at gunpoint to barge into this sub . 
  if you do n't have time to read stuff , then do n't reply to it . 
  it 's basic rules of internet debates and respect . 
  it is better not to reply at all than to reply a multi-paragraph post without reading it and making a bullshit reply that is already answered in the original post . 
  when you reply with one-liner crap that does n't even answer the original post , you 're not contributing to anything . 
  and when you 're intruding into a sub that 's not even made for you , then that 's doubly irritating for me . 
  i do n't go into specialised subs myself without reading their arguments and replying to them in full because specialised subs are made for a reason : to escape shitty comments like yours and to focus on a particular like-minded or like-origin redditors . 
  what a surprise , people just read the top part of my comment without reading it all . 
  i write long-winded posts and this happens every time . 
  in the second paragraph , i say : * i mean sure , some americans condemn it when things are n't going so well anymore , but how often do you hear the condemnation when the operations go well ? 
  or how often do americans get so heated and emotional to the point of saying ` fuck you too , you piece of shit ' ? 
  * if you 're going to barge in here as an american in a sub that was made specifically to escape the american circlejerk of the defaults , why not at least show some goddamn courtesy and actually read more than a single sentence of my my reply , rather than reading the first sentence and rushing to reply ? 
  hah , what are you , a butthurt american ? 
  does it hurt when the shoe is on your foot , when it 's not just amis making up ignorant or unfunny shit about europe ? 
  the reddit defaults are at least as bad of a circlejerk , but likely worse i 'd say . 
  to call out this sub for being a circlejerk is a pretty tall order -- you better have a high moral ground here . 
  at least here the vote distribution is very balanced whereas if you go against reddit circlejerk , well , you 're usually gon na have a bad time unless you do some of those bs contrarian stuff that reddit loves to eat up . 
  hmm , let me see , redditinvestigator.com looks up your post history stats by sub . 
  let 's see : askreddit : 170 adviceanimals : 74 videos : 51 funny : 22 todayilearned : 19 wtf : 19 subredditdrama : 19 pics : 12 gifs : 3 aww : 2 europe : 2 askmen : 2 iama : 1 tumblrinaction : 1 gaming : 1 confession : 1 worldnews : 1 ahhh , ok , got it . 
  this sub is suuuuch a circlejerk . 
  unlike fine and upstanding subs of askreddit , adviceanimals , videos , funny , til , wtf and srd . 
  i see you 're likely an american who arrived here via srd link , eh ? 
  better not vote here then , or else you will get shadowbanned . 
  i got shadowbanned before for voting on srd-link threads . 
  they 're very good at meting out those things . 
  in any case , you 're really fucking with me here if you expect me to take your accusations seriously . 
  literally every sub you post in is a gigantic circlejerk . 
  funny , i do n't see many americans get so hot and bothered about their various military excursion or their support of brutal regimes with weapons , sometimes highly illegal weapons ( chemical components for saddam 's poison gas industry , for instance ) . 
  i mean sure , some americans condemn it when things are n't going so well anymore , but how often do you hear the condemnation when the operations go well ? 
  or how often do americans get so heated and emotional to the point of saying ` fuck you too , you piece of shit ' ? 
  edit : ultimately the point is n't that ` americans deserved boston bombings ' . 
  nobody is saying that , except the extremists frothing with hatred of the us . 
  but it is ` international karma ' , if you will . 
  us congressmen support ira terror campaign , primarily from boston . 
  it 's cute for them to masturbate to their fantasies of the ` overthrowing of british tyranny ' by their bullshitted cousins ( * i say bullshit because i swear , everyone in the states says they are part irish * ) with whom they have no cultural connection left ( * sorry , getting sozzled on st patrick 's day is not enough * ) . 
  they do n't see the violence and death . 
  well , now they do . 
  it 's sad that people had to die but there is certainly a ` poetic justice ' element to this . 
  and if america was n't so well-isolated from its dirty deeds , it would be far more hesitant to carry them out . 
  it is easy to want war in the us . 
  there is no real blood price for a war here . 
  soldiers sign up willingly and if they do perish , it is in very small to nonexistent amounts for most operations . 
  people do n't connect the brutality of war with their political views . 
  war-mongering is very common amongst republican party in the us . 
  if us was truly hurt every time it started a war , it would become a lot wiser and avoid unnecessary wars . 
  also , i really loathe the american thinking of freedom  human lives . 
  iraq does have freedom of a sort today . 
  but at what price ? 
  two million orphans , half a million dead civilians ? 
  cities ruined , economy sunk ( starting with the sanctions in the 90s ) , priceless historical monuments driven over by tanks ? 
  did iraq consent to this ? 
  does national right to sovereignty and self-determination mean nothing anymore ? 
  if america sunk deeper into inequality and the eu invaded to create a more equal , more socialised state , would americans have to like it ? 
  even if the eu created a better state in the us , americans have their right to self-determination and they will rightfully hate anyone who invades their soil and interferes with their affairs . 
  oh please , reddit makes far shittier jokes all the time , usually about minorities or women or rape/pedo/abuse and everyone upvotes them . 
  or shit like ` dae british have bad teeth ??! 1 ?? ', 
  that even get gilded and get 1000s of upvotes . 
  of all the jokes to make , we are going to criticise the one about americans being bad at geography ? 
  i call bullshit on this . 
  it 's not even inaccurate - americans are truly really bad at geography , as a russian expat living in the us . 
  they are a superpower and a very insular nation . 
  there is very little incentive for anyone here to learn geography . 
  when i was a kid ( primary school ) in russia one of our favourite games was to play the geography game - i name a world capital , the person next to me has to name a world capital that has the same starting letter as the ending letter of the capital i named . 
  we played this game until someone could n't name a capital . 
  an easier version of this game was with country names . 
  all in all , i could not imagine most american * adults * playing this game , let alone kids . 
  i do n't mean the ussr example to be like catalonia . 
  i really did n't mean to liken the two , but looks like two people already thought that 's what i meant , so i guess my wording was misleading . 
  i was just rambling off topic with the ussr bit . 
  catalonia is a popular movement , yes . 
  i do n't doubt that ( although i read that only a slim majority wants actual independence , iirc ) . 
  i have a friend from spain , he 's told me enough about you guys , heh . 
  he does n't actually care that much for a spaniard , but that 's not the point really . 
  separatist movements in developed countries inherently misguided imo . 
  they all think it will be a glorious change . 
  it wo n't . 
  things will still be the same . 
  spain is a bit of a special case , it went through very rough economic times followed by the hated austerity measures ( that were n't close to being enough anyway ) . 
  catalonia feels like they 're stuck with spanish mistakes , yeah . 
  but i 'm not sure that creating a separate country will solve these problems . 
  i subscribe to the * economist * and read my news daily on bbc . 
  i 'm not reading some crackpot blogs and i 'm not just sitting on reddit . 
  i read a lot and believe me , i read about your situation too . 
  yes , it hurts when you are paying more in taxes than you receive . 
  but i also read that you 're going to be out of the eu for more than just a year likely as such things are n't done swiftly . 
  i do n't know what customs agreements spain will sign either . 
  in either case , it 's not going to look good for trade . 
  i read about the debt in catalonia - it 's considerable and starting off an independent polity with such debt wo n't be pretty .

  i.e. , it 's a very general medal that can be awarded for a variety of reasons . 
  what i 'm saying is - you should probably find a better metaphor . 
  a church is a church . 
  it had its moment in the 13th-15th century , when monasteries moved the science forward , and then it went back to being a political institution . 
  i hope it goes away , but it 's highly unlikely . 
  and i would have gotten away with it too , if it were n't for you meddling trolls !, 
  ad hominem , the troll 's last defense . 
   that also happened right after it was annexed with the osce observers ( mainly german ) forbidden from intereting . 
  you mean the osce observers [ that were invited and declined ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/10/ukraine-crisis-referendum-osce-idusl6n0m73ap20140310 ) ? 
  goalpost mover detected . 
  so , via the wayback machine i 've managed to find that picture . 
  [ that 's a photo from 1977 victory parade ] ( http://www.gettyimages.in/detail/news-photo/red-square-moscow-nov-1977-soviet-troops-march-in-the-nov-news-photo/170982774 ) . 
  how exactly is it related to modern russia ? 
   putin is kissing icons at church putin is an orthodox christian , news at 11 . 
   whilst speaking fondly of the ussr i seem to remember him saying `` whoever does not miss the soviet union has no heart . 
  whoever wants it back has no brain . '', 
   they `` they '' here being the communist party of russian federation . 
  gee , i wonder why . 
  also the bbillboard is celebrating the victory in world war 2 , which stalin was kinda sorta involved in . 
   russia unveils two stalin monuments in single day and those people are also worshiping the tzar and are devout christians ?

  i do n't know how significant that is , because the structure of saudi arabia 's budget is hidden from me . 
   russia would not be able to pay its bills . 
  what , all 46 milliard dollars of debt the state has ? 
  that 's a whooping 2 % of the gdp . 
   instead they have become a white alcoholic saudi arabia saudi arabia - oil export is 45 % of the country 's gdp . 
  russia - oil export is 9 % of the country 's gdp . 
  clearly those two are the same .

  which he admitted that he may have done .

  in the same way i can claim that [ the rumors of obama being a batman villain ] ( http://www.ayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/funny-barack-obama-faces-4.jpg ) are very definitely not true , and are in fact a dirty provocation by the opposition .

  he 's also married to an olympic champion and tv star , whose estimated annual income vastly exceeds the estimated price of that watch . 
   i vividly remember when the court was about to decide wether to give navalny a real prison sentence a bunch of people flooded central moscow and the authorities chickened out .

  no , i enjoy seeing my country improve and prosper over the last 15 years .

  wow . 
  it 's hard to imagine a title more confusing and misleading . 
   so many people went into the street that they backpedalled pfhahaha . 
  the largest movement navalny ever got was the bolotnaya riot , and look how well that went . 
  attention to navalny 's trial was negligible , as is navalny himself now . 
  he had his moment , and he failed . 
   i 'm pretty sure that even calling it `` counter-sanctions '' instead of simply `` sanctions '' already strongly implies that it 's the eus fault . 
  i 'm pretty sure it would be an objective truth , because eu imposed sanctions and russia imposed counter-sanctions . 
   pro-kremlin activists even attached fake , us diplomatic licence-plates to a car and filmed it at a campaign rally , to `` prove '' that the opposition are treacherous puppets of the west . 
  it 's not like they even had to do this , when members of the us embassy admit that they visited kostroma and were seen together with navalny & co, 
  not a clue . 
  i do n't think the bolded/unbolded name actually matters that much , since there 's a handy logo on the left side . 
  `` new '' ? 
  only vocal pro-american opposition is the * real * opposition . 
  do n't you know anything about politics ? 
   as for why some of names are in bold , i have no fucking clue . 
  looks like putin 's `` united russia '' and zhirinovsky 's `` ldpr '' both are in bold , so i assume position parties get highlighted while opposition just gets plain font . 
  no , the [ kostroma 's election commitee has clarified this ] ( http://kostroma.izbirkom.ru/way/1049340/sx/art/1101967/cp/1/br/1049344.html.html ) . 
  it 's literally the same writing as in the party 's charter . 
  the parties that have their names bolded had their names bolded in their charters . 
  edit : it 's also the same reason for why some parties are in full capital letters and some are not . 
  in the same sense as `` wanted '' is a russian movie , i suppose .

  i 'm sure greece 's kneecaps will be just fine after it refuses to pay its debts . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_cyclone pretty much . 
  the guys who survived the afghanistan war went on to become the al-qaeda , armed with us guns and trained by us soldiers . 
   russia made afghanistan a mess . 
  wooooow . 
  revolutionary mood appears in afghanistan , us starts training and arming the rebels , the afghani government requests the ussr 's help , ussr answers . 
  clearly the afghanistan war happened because ussr decided to answer the legitimate government 's plea for help , and not because of operation cyclone or anything like that . 
  well , eu is the germany 's fourth reich , only via the economic control now . 
  read the greece 's loan agreements . 
  the problem i have is with various journalists saying `` russia promised x in minsk 2 . '', 
  this is always factually wrong and biased , because russia did n't promise anything in minsk 2 . 
  it could n't possibly have promissed anything in minsk 2 ( other than cooperation ) , because russia denies its involvement with the civil war/anti-terrorist operation/russian invasion in the ukraine . 
   but do the same things russia do russian state does not support violence against homosexuals , and does n't promote it . 
  `` the netherlands '' is looking down at you . 
  there are several countries which begin with a definite article . 
  it 's `` the congo '' , `` the sudan '' , `` the netherlands '' , `` the bahamas '' , and `` the philippines '' . 
  also `` the united states '' of course . 
  countries get a `` the '' in english if they are a geographical region like `` the sudan '' , if they are plural noun like `` the netherlands '' , or if they are in long form and have an adjective-noun structure like `` the slovak republic '' . 
  they are also given a `` the '' if they conform to all three of those , like `` the united states '' . 
  so it 's `` the netherlands '' or `` holland '' ( no `` the '' ) .

  what would you do ? 
  do you support military actions that will no doubt harm civilians or not ? 
  and people accuse russians of `` what-about-isms '' . 
  the reality of the situation * now * on the ground in the * real world * is that the government in kiev which was placed into power via an armed uprising is trying to disenfranchise a significant portion of the population it seized power over and disenfranchised from voicing its will . 
  unlike a civilized nation worthy of the eu , it chose to use the army instead of negotiations and accommodations . 
  i try to communicate with people such as yourself because you are on the warpath . 
  you support violence and continue to support it out of paranoia and fear . 
  you 'd rather feel safe under the thumb of nato than allow hundreds of thousands of people self determination , and you 're willing to turn a blind eye to the murder of hundreds to get your way . 
  quoted directly from reuters :  i knew that a buk came from luhansk . 
  at the time i was told that a buk from luhansk was coming under the flag of the lnr , '' he said , referring to the luhansk people 's republic , the main rebel group operating in luhansk , one of two rebel provinces along with donetsk , the province where the crash took place . 
   `` that buk i know about . 
  i heard about it . 
  i think they sent it back . 
  because i found out about it at exactly the moment that i found out that this tragedy had taken place . 
  they probably sent it back in order to remove proof of its presence , '' khodakovsky told reuters on tuesday . 
  not * once * does he mention russia . 
  he mentions the rebels of luhansk being in posession of a buk . 
  he is not a member of that group and states so openly , and continues on to say that he * thinks * they sent it back ( to luhansk , the only party mentioned , not russia as you are more than proud of putting in his mouth ) . 
  the article i linked then goes on to take several issues with the ability of reuter 's staff to accurately translate russian . 
   reuters then released the recording of the interview with khodakovsky in russian , which was published by radio free europe/radio liberty . 
  in it , khodakovsky can be heard to say in russian `` ya znal shto buk shol iz luganska '' which would be more accurately translated as `` i knew that a buk was coming '' in the past imperfect , not past perfect , `` i knew that a buk came , '' as originally translated by reuters . 
   he then said `` v etot moment mne skazali shto iz luganska shol pod flagom lnr v storonu snizhne '' `` at that moment i was told it was coming from lugansk under the flag of the lpr toward snizhne '' . 
  he adds a line not included in the reuters quoted excerpt or the rfe/rl translation transcript , `` gde-to nakhoditsya kren ego ne izvestno '' `` located somewhere who the hell knows . '' then `` ob etom buk ya znal , ya slyshal , '' `` i knew about that buk , i heard about it . '' he then reiterates his point that ukraine had the information in advance , so should have closed the airspace -- which was the context for his reference to the news from lugansk . 
  that reuters did not release a full translation of the interview should make you mistrustful enough . 
  journalism 101 is that a person can be made to say * anything * through paraphrased quotes and strategically placed ellipses . 
  try reading a more nuanced source . 
  http://www.interpretermag.com/russian-backed-separatist-khodakovsky-changes-his-story-to-reuters-or-does-he/  the thrust of khodakovsky 's interview appeared to be to imply that a rival separatist group , the `` lugansk people 's republic '' ( lpr ) , could have possessed buks , and also to pin on the ukrainian military ultimate responsibility for the shoot-down of the malaysian plane , because they claimed to have confirmed the presence of buks in the region , and should have re-routed civilian flights accordingly ...  khodakovsky said his unit had never possessed buks , but they may have been used by rebels from other units . 
   `` the fact is , this is a theatre of military activity occupied by our , let 's say , partners in the rebel movement , with which our cooperation is somewhat conditional , '' he said . 
   `` what resources our partners have , we can not be entirely certain . 
  was there ( a buk ) ? 
  was n't there ? 
  if there was proof that there was , then there can be no question . '' he then went on to make his argument for ukrainian military responsibility . 
  ...  so to incite such an invasion -- an outcome khodakovsky actually says the separatists do not want -- russia and the `` militia '' have to be accused of something awful . 
  he reiterates a common notion of soviet propaganda , that nato and the us only get into wars so that their defense industry can have earn maximum profits while ukraine lies in ruins . 
   if this sounds confusing , contradictory and even crazy , it may very well be intended as such ; after all , khodakovsky is an officer in the sbu , trained by the soviet kgb and then later cooperating ( and infiltrated by ) russian intelligence today . 
  disinformation , sowing confusing , maskirovka or covering up of truths -- these are all part of his job description . 
   the strategy of propagandists in moscow throughout the crisis engendered by the malaysian aircraft shoot-down has been to boldly and wildly throw up different contradictory explanations and make fierce accusations in rapid succession , seeing if one sticks and moving on to another as western skepticism grows . 
  perhaps khodakovsky is using the same methods ...  westerners prefer to see the phenomenon of khodakovsky as explained by him being a `` loose canon '' or even `` going rogue , '' but it 's important to remember that throughout the three months of the conflict , he has remained fighting as leader of vostok and never been pushed out of power , like other leaders such as denis pushilin . 
  he is not on the run now , as far as we know . 
  he 's survived a number of internal political battles as well as real battles , and as of this writing , neither col. strelkov or aleksandr boroday have said anything to confirm or deny his claims or counter-claims to reuters ; they are letting nature take its course . 
  ruvesna ( `` russian spring '' ) is the only pro-separatist outlet to have addressed the issue ; it has asked reuters to publish a tape of the interview and `` if khodakovsky lies , '' will publish this ... 
   even if it were ukrainians we know who 's this conflict 's fault is . 
  last i checked kiev attacked the east , not the other way around . 
  it 's the government the maidan installed that sent in tanks , artillery , and jets . 
  it 's the government of the maidan that formed a militia and instituted a draft to supress the very kind of action which put it into power from happening again . 
  the dpr started out as a mirror to the maidan , with clubs and pistols and all the same methodology . 
  viktor yanukovych used riot police and resigned after a few civilian deaths . 
  the new government unapologetically uses outright military force and is n't even phased by the deaths of 300 + civilians in the last few weeks . 
  indeed , they 're liquidating opposing political parties rather than entertain the idea of negotiations . 
  the dpr only militarized in response to * the very same * government violence that led to the overthrow of the last ukrainian government . 
  or do you buy the propaganda which completely robs them of agency , instead choosing to believe that the east is held hostage by a handful of russians ? 
   and if you still support putin you have to put up with it . 
  i support the dpr . 
  stop robbing them of agency and attributing every act to the master-plan of putin . 
  strelkov does n't even have control over every rebel group in the region , and he 's the one leading the resistance . 
  they act for their own self-preservation in the face of state violence . 
  it 's shocking that the media which has lied to you on hundreds of occasions in the past 15 years to excuse wars and invasions and incarcerations and extraditions of every sort and variety now has such iron faith held in it . 
  it is the modus operandi of these organizations to reinterpret the truth through lies of omission and often simply by outright lying . 
  mh17 was politicized and has continued to be politicized from zero hour onward , relying on such sturdy proof as rumors on social networking sites to take political advantage of 300 civilian deaths before their corpses had even cooled . 
  why does n't this arouse any suspicion in you whatsoever , particularly after all the lessons you should have learned in iraq , afghanistan , pakistan , yemen , egypt , libya , syria , israel , et al ad infinitum ? 
  it was called the dissolution of the ussr , and other than the killing of communist party members in moscow it went rather peacefully as far as coups go . 
  it is in any case irrelevant to the situation as it is * now * . 
  what 's next in your arsenal of apologetics ? 
   they 're not ` shelling their cities ' http://ukraine-human-rights.org/shelling-of-lugansk-and-sievierodonetsk-by-ukrainian-army-on-the-18th-of-july-2014/ call it what you want . 
  they 're deliberately targeting civilians . 
  they may call them terrorists , but they know that the city is n't being held hostage , they know it 's actively resisting . 
  and so they 're attacking the city . 
  and they know that just because they label them terrorists , they 'll have a horde of eu apologists on the internet doing their propaganda dirty work for them . 
  all while you 've been decrying the separatists in every which way for killing civilians by mistake , the people you support have been killing them quite on purpose . 
  the russian state has released only one statement . 
  shall we also count all of the hastily compiled accusations flying out of the mouths of the various '' honest '' western news sources , who suddenly knew without a doubt that putin and russia were to blame , before the corpses of the dead had even had time to cool ? 
  see how quickly they politicized the murder of 300 people , before any supporting evidence had even been presented or certified ? 
  that is a disrespect beyond any other . 
  the most they had were claims of hearsay , vague government claims without actual proof presented , and stern warnings from politicians . 
  the russian ministry of defence has released actual surveillance photos and radar records . 
  everybody . 
  you 're just naive enough to think that you are n't . 
   the culprit is the invader . 
  by all means , nobody asked the ukranian military to start shelling these cities . 
  they 're invited to go home . 
   ukraine is trying to get its country back from these terrorists supported by russia . 
  hook , line , and sinker you 've swallowed propaganda . 
  and now from your mouth spews such wonderful hatred and sewage such as :  by all means this is war , and unfortunately innocent people die in wars . 
   also the way you word is sounds like the ukraine army is specifically targeting the civillian population , which i think is highly unlikely ( especially because there is probably still quite the number of ethnic ukrainians there ) . 
  http://ukraine-human-rights.org/enc/informations/murder/ they disagreed with the coup of the maidan , and made their own , if the maidan is legitimate they are as well . 
  ukraine * attacked them * , with grad rockets , tanks , and jets . 
  the * only fucking alternative * is negotiation , not the shelling of hospitals , schools , and apartment blocks . 
  listen to yourself speak !, 
  snipers kill 80 civilian protestors in kiev , and there 's outrage . 
  the maidan 's military kills hundreds of civilians across the east , and it 's just war ; forget self determination , forget negotiation . 
   you could also argue : why are the rebels submitting the civillians there to more suffering by refusing to give up a losing battle ? 
  because the civilians want nothing to do with the ukranian government any more . 
  refugees are fleeing to russia , not ukraine . 
  the people here bite hard on all too convenient and all too rapid and practiced accusations , without even so much as a photograph of actual evidence , and completely ignore it when the russians provide actual photographic evidence to the contrary . 
  it has me very worried . 
  except you 're using rules in a situation to which they do not apply , probably in order to silence dissent . 
  the composition of paramilitary forces attacking civilian populations is newsworthy , their twitter accounts bragging about their actions are newsworthy . 
  these are not reddit users who are being witch-hunted for their unpopular opinions , these are publicly active political figures committing crimes . 
  all relevant personal information in the liveleak article is newsworthy , it 's an exploration of the european origins of some of the nazis in ukraine 's national guard . 
  why is a dossier on [ these men ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/05/06/article-2621367-1d9d130200000578-702_634x443.jpg ) newsworthy , but not one of eu citizens ?

  12th of june, 
  it 's one of the main concerns about this law . 
  people would be assigned according to the area of their previous apartments , not according to the their price, 
  i 'm oversimplifying quite a bit here but it 's a protest * against the renovation law . 
  it will allow moscow government to tear down houses which are in need of repair without people 's approval . 
  the story is much more complex though, 
  it 's not only about khruschevks , according to the law , even the kremlin can be demolished . 
  [ context ] ( https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-moscow-protests-demolition-krushchev-era-housing/28487244.html ) also worth noting that alexei navalny attended the protest but was removed by the police when he approached the stage . 
  dmitry gudkov , a prominent russian politician , refused to give his speech because of this . 
  police says 5k people went there , independent source says 20k people . 
  [ kremlin bots are all over twitter right now ] ( https://i.imgur.com/dkoo5kz.jpg ) , spamming that only 5k attended the protest . 
  yes , it is . 
  it 's forbidden to read extremist literature , especially in public !, 
   i guess that 's because of the decades lasting propaganda . 
  and those are russians outside of russia , now try to imagine what 's it 's like inside of russia where all the media is controlled . 
   that probably are even worse than the putin 's regime . 
  actually , no . 
  the communist party in itself is controlled and just a spoiler for the united russia during the parliamentary elections and the head of the communist party is an asshole , but there are some reasonable individual communists . 
  the most recent case : the communists in the duma demanded to launch a parliamentary investigation into the alleged corruption of the prime minister . 
  their proposal was declined the thing about this year 's protests is that they have widened . 
  there 're protests in the citites where people were quiet just 2-3 years ago . 
  it 's true that there were n't that many people in moscow but remember that this protest was n't sanctioned , as a result 1030 people were detained . 
  we 'll see what will happen in moscow on 14 of may and what will happen all across russia on 12th of june , when navalny planned his next protest ( 173 cities are already preparing for this ) they were anti-soviet protests in russia too . 
  for example [ this one ] ( http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/egaristotel/50675427/109458/109458_original.jpg ) ( approx 400-500 thousands of people ),

  misleading . 
  if the author thinks that all people from the caucasus look like the chechen terrorists , then he 's probably a huge racist  at least some features of democracy .

  interesting is that they have been invited to the state duma with an `` interesting proposal '' on the day of this attack . 
  these idiots are also known for constantly ruining nemtsov memorial . 
  i hope that some people will be kind enough to gouge out their eyes in return because police obviously wo n't do anything about it . 
  edit : one of the attacker confessed that he was there , says `` he was just filming '' . 
  serb denies the allegations but their leader says `` i wish we participated in this '' . 
  interesting is that the other attacker was leading a storm of the kharkiv 's administration back in 2014 in the attempt to create a `` kharkiv `` people 's '' republic '' . 
  also this attacker is literally one handshake away from putin because he had meetings with putin 's advisor glazyev . 
  he is n't . 
  he said that he hires bodyguards only during the protests and during his visits to the regions outside of moscow . 
  he actually takes a lot of criticism from his supporters because he does n't spend enough money for his own protection .

  it 's around 60 % of young people of 16-24 year bracket , the rest are older , according to u/tonygaze 's link , so * a bit * more than just `` sprinkled in '', 
  my bad , i 'm blind , apparently . 
  moscow has moscow river together with a system of reservoirs and canals ( moscow canal , connecting moscow to volga river provides about a half of the city 's consumption ) . 
  history of that system is pretty grim , as it was one of the main gulag projects , so we in a sort owe it to the victims of the great terror . 
  before the hydrotechnical improvements were built , moscow had problems with water supply sometimes , iirc . 
  now , it 's more than adequate . 
  pretty close , but something 's not quite right ( like if he was a russian from some remote region or one of the soviet republics ) . 
  but i 'm not 100 % sure either . 
  plus i had a great difficulty deciphering the `` pickle '' word, 
   1565 did you mean 1569 ? 
  could n't find anything relevant about 1565, 
  definitely !, 
  however , after some further googling , it comes out that the relationship is false , as at least modern etymology traces slavic sladky to the same origins as salt : [ wiktionary ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sladk%c3%bd ) :(, 
   sadhbh  sadhbh ( also spelled sadb , saibh , sadbh , sadhb ; anglicised sive or saeve ) is an irish feminine personal name . 
  derived from proto-celtic * s\u016d\u0101d\u016d\u0101 ' ( the ) sweet and lovely ( lady ) ' interesting : s\u016d\u0101d\u016d\u0101 looks quite similar to our ` sladkiy/sladkaya ' ( sweet ), 
  hey , dublin is okay as it is . 
  just look at lublin . 
  ah , right you are , i thought about it later as well , thanks, 
  thermal expansion would still be proportional to the amount of substance or volume . 
  so , mediterranean , cut off from the atlantic ocean should have lower steric rise than being connected to it , do n't you think ? 
  just a first result from googling : apparently , [ it 's a thing , it 's called steric rise ] ( https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/411.htm ), 
  moscow , love-hate relationship . 
  btw , there was a discussion about the american exceptionalism on askeurope about two months ago , [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5z8ilg/what_do_you_believe_the_term_american/ ) . 
  i believe the answer to your question was quite evident there as well . 
   empty land in the east ahem ... 
  there 's a * subtle * difference between weak and empty ... 
  thanks for the recommendation . 
  i 'll give it a try . 
  he looks like a guy , who 's really in love with polish culture . 
  i hope it does n't take a toll on the impartiality of the narrative , though . 
  period/aspect ? 
  i believe , the formation of the medieval political system of poland is the process i 'd like to understand better . 
  do you mean , the period after grand duchy of moscow became political center of russia and the golden horde was shaken off , but before the russian empire was proclaimed ? 
  or in more broad sense , monarchic autocracy in russia , including all the russian emperors as well ? 
  i really want to read more about history of poland . 
  i feel like there might be some keys to our history as well , given centuries of antagonizing each other and fighting for dominance in the region . 
  next come probably the histories of the byzantine empire and lithuania ( pre-commonwealth mainly ) . 
  and roman history is fascinating as well . 
  ps : it would be great if someone could recommend some main works on polish history : either entry-level overview works , or main chronicles . 
  come on , maybe it 's time to stop killing poland ? 
  we 've done it few times already . 
  well , jokes about killing each other might be funnier for the american states than for the european countries . 
  cause , you know , you can never be sure when they are n't really joking . 
  yeah , moscow is quite hard to appreciate as a tourism destination . 
  it 's a world on its own , with its hidden gems and overrated attractions at the same time , with ugly monsters built in beautiful neighborhoods sometimes , or unexpectedly nice places hidden amidst some dull surroundings . 
  so , you either love moscow ( then , you * might * find it beautiful in a way , and still , not guaranteed ) , or not ( then , you 're guaranteed to find it quite unattractive ) . 
  not sure if that 's a * dumbest * nimby issue , but people protesting against new mosques nearby are quite close . 
  thing is nobody gives about the locals unless it goes along with interests of someone of power , then the opinion of the locals will be supported and presented as the major factor . 
  if i got u/schwertritter right , he does n't say babuszka is a proper polish word , just that it would sound so , * if * it were a polish word ( correct me if i 'm wrong , please ) . 
  anyway , compared to the examples in this post , misplaced stress is such a mild offence that it should n't even bother , i guess . 
  yep . 
  russian cheeses ( not all , but the most of them ) are horrendous . 
  and they got a lot worse after the * countersanctions * ( less need to worry about the competition anymore ) . 
  however , by some definitions of cheese , tvorog could be called a cheese itself . 
  if so , it would be the most eaten , i guess . 
  idk , i 've met a number of europeans for whom that exact word was one of the few words they knew in russian . 
  yes , in that exact pronunciation . 
  and yes , i guess it means for them that stereotypical russian elderly woman/granny in headscarf, 
  you could write every russian word with even the basic latin , of course ( with apostrophe at least ) . 
  thing is , czech alphabet is tailored for czech , and our languages , even while both slavic , are still quite distant . 
  serious discussion within russia ? 
  no , i do n't think so . 
  cyrillic script is an integral part of our language and culture . 
  i ca n't imagine dropping it , as it would mean cutting ties with more than a thousand years of our history ( the way i see it ) . 
  and even while there are many things in it that ought to stay in the past , that would be simply too much to ask . 
  unesco [ atlas of the world 's languages in danger ] ( http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php ) currently names ** 131 languages ** in russia as different levels of vulnerable/endangered/extinct , including : * 20 vulnerable * 49 definitely endangered * 29 severely endangered * 22 critically endangered * 15 extinct that of course includes different varieties of the same language in some cases , and 20 of the vulnerable i would n't call dying at all ( i.e. 
  chechen , ingush , some other major north caucasian languages plus major siberian languages like yakut ) . 
  but even as the higher estimate it shows the scale of the problem . 
  we use cyrillic alphabet , but i believe we have no problems with latin alphabet ( except maybe some old people ) . 
  but we are n't going to drop cyrillic for latin under no circumstances , that 's for sure . 
  however , that 's the english name of it , its russian name can be translated as * tale of the bygone years * . 
  i ca n't say i come across just * \u0411\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f * ( britain ) often . 
  for me , it 's either * \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f * ( velikobritaniya , great britain ) - it 's also used as the official name of the uk in russian ( for example , it 's what the embassy of the uk in russia uses ) , or , colloquially , just * \u0410\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u044f * ( england ) . 
  however , if you read primary chronicle a bit more carefully , you could argue that it would rather be oleg . 
  as when it was spoken about rurik 's period , rus ' there was always mentioned in context of the varangians only . 
  also , under his reign first documents of diplomacy of newly formed state appeared , while rurik never made it to documented contacts with other nations ( ps : diplomatic contacts , as there were documented raids of rus/ros people before oleg 's times ) . 
  need to add that many sources only include two brothers : lech and czech . 
  also , our main chronicle , [ the primary chronicle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/primary_chronicle ) makes no account of that story . 
  i do n't know about ukraine and belarus , but in russia probably nobody would count some legendary rus to be a founder of the old rus ' . 
  that 's a truth nobody really denies . 
  the devil is in the details , as always . 
  there 's a never-ending discussion about molotov-ribbentrop pact , and many of us have thought many times about it and went through multiple discussions regarding it , also not that it is omitted from our history lessons , but a ) it is again a decision of soviet leadership , not the people b ) can be interpreted in many ways , and is quite a difficult historical question as it is , given all the context - demanding an easy answer for it quickly degrades the discussion to shouting and mutual blaming . 
  you can find a [ plenty of related discussions ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/search?q=molotov-ribbentrop&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) on r/askhistorians ( for example , you might find [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/4vm87q/why_didnt_france_and_britain_declare_war_on_the/ ) interesting ) . 
  i hope i did n't sound like stalin apologist in this reply , i understand the grievances and accusations of the nations that were victims of our domination in the region , and can say that i personally feel sorry about the way they were mistreated , but i humbly hope that people could understand our point of view too . 
  but to be fair , most of our muslims do n't wear turbans , so sikhs would probably be recognized as tourists , i guess . 
  or at least , as indians . 
  also , there was an article about sikhs cultural centre in moscow i 've read few years ago . 
  welp , i thought rivalry is something that is supposed to be mutual , also distinct from enmity , more about competition than of being an enemy ? 
  btw , no i do n't think of the finns neither as rivals nor as enemies . 
  i mean , i know we have bad blood but i certainly wo n't count relationship with finland as one of the worst . 
  i think all or almost all of them are capable of speaking russian to some extent . 
  and not enough contacts with byzantium , i guess . 
   the area that is now belarus and ukraine were a country called the `` kievan rus ' '' . 
  plus western part of modern russia , naturally .

  it would be russian pinachet lol ), 
  i understand it , but still not enough for such title . 
  misleading article . 
  he did n't said it , he compared the methods . 
  our country is big and i think it was also the aim to specify each our big region in some sport . 
  siberian teams are traditionally more rich and strong in hockey , f.e. 
  biathlon is very popular in russia , sad that our current results are far from the best, 
  biathlon, 
  i like the idea that we are asians , who is brought up as europeans . 
  khanty-mansiysk is in asia , not europe . 
  should n't be here, 
  the implementation of any russian ideas could led to the misery for them . 
  besides , maybe , the ideas that can completely destroy russia as a country . 
  the problem is not ideas , the problem is big problematic neighbour with big army . 
  by the way , `` nothing but misery '' sounds stupid, 
  until results of these referendums would n't be counterfeit , all is ok . 
  not totalitarian , but democratic . 
  people themselves decided to gave eu power to control market and movement . 
  and they can always change the decision . 
  but eu already united them, 
  and maybe they were right, 
  after what `` that '' ? 
  what changed after this ? 
  gays will unite europe, 
  if to count all surrogate alcohol , that 's right . 
  samogon is still pretty popular . 
   is it discussed a lot in russia as a crises or no ? 
  do n't think so . 
  more wealthy russians usually do n't face with this problem . 
  and , to be honest , they do n't care how much people will die from this . 
  it is normal to find in the upvoted comments , under this news on russian , something like `` just a natural selection '' . 
  less wealthy just do n't find it so unnormal . 
  it sounds overestimated . 
  only poor ended alcoholics drink it , we 've a lot of them , but not 10 % of population , i guess . 
  this shit kills you so fast , that if it is right , we would have become extinct, 
  let 's be honest - you are already happy, 
  ca n't find it in your article . 
  and russia , of course , did n't do it . 
  no reason for . 
  maybe separatists or ukrainan army - facts say that more likely separatists, 
   what the russian army heroes do . 
  brought from russia = / = crashed by russia, 
  maybe they are fight , but to think that all ( or most of the ) soldiers on that side are russian regular army is just stupid, 
  no more :( . 
  now she is just a duma deputy . 
  and her rating fell after several contradictory statements, 
  google translate : access to the site can be blocked on the territory of ukraine . 
  prosecutor 's office of crimea has opened a criminal proceedings against the booking.com website `` for trafficking in stolen . '', 
  this was reported by people 's deputy gregory logvinsky . 
  `` the dutch company booking.com ... actively cooperates with the gang of impostors power , but also openly advertises , makes transactions and sells accommodation in stolen ukraine crimea sanatoriums and hotels . 
  the insolence comes to the fact that sell tickets , even in the '' depressed `` at the verkhovna rada and the . 
  administration of the president of the sanatorium , actually stealing money from the higher authorities of ukraine accordingly , it is an accomplice of the crime under article 332-1 , 191 of the criminal code of ukraine, 
  you really believe that your armies fought only versus russian forces ? 
  how can you even imagine that , i do n't understand . 
  i do n't deny that russian forces play significiant role in this war , but radikal opinions like that are just weird . 
   not sure if ambassador counts as one . 
  should we fear about our embassy in ukraine ? 
  at least two and both are quite big . 
  does n't mean anything , just a tradition, 
  google translate : ukrainian mp volodymyr parasyuk vnefraktsionnyh unexpectedly responded to the murder of the russian ambassador andrei karlov in ankara . 
  on his facebook page , he wrote that the killer - 22-year-old policeman , disgruntled russian policy in syria - can be called a hero . 
  `` when a person with my life is ready to go to extreme measures , for the idea , for the sake of truth , we can say with confidence - hero '' - parasyuk said . 
  later deputy in the comments under the post attributed to that hero is a murderer ambassador for his people . 
  former police officer killed by shots in the back of the charles . 
  he was later killed special forces . 
  it is a prerequisite, 
  that 's the main what we need to know from this news, 
  depend on what do you put in this term . 
  if you used it in philosophy sense , you are right . 
  but i meant far-right directionality of the apf, 
  party against which this protest, 
  but this party looks like real fascists, 
  warplanes should were given in 1999, 
  was it neccesary to break the law for this protest ? 
  99 % of europeans are already anti-fascist, 
  without this system both you and me would have never existed . 
  maybe as a slave of some german, 
  was i wrong ? 
  so ... look at the comments now . 
  and tell me i was wrong, 
  so ... look at the comments now, 
  very convenient . 
  much easier to hate foreign conqueror than to hate your own country, 
  they claim that they were occupied, 
  another post only for discussing how awful was soviet regime, 
  it is oxymoron . 
  `` war crimes '' are the crimes versus western world, 
  of the last 1000 years i can say, 
  to be a woman in russian male prison ? 
  seems not like a good plan, 
  why ? 
  what good is it ? 
  i 'm not argue , but ca n't understand, 
  it 's bad because it prevents to build ideal left-wing world - world with democracy in any state , world without wars and military conflicts . 
  to be honest - we do n't so much talk about estonia and other baltics . 
  as for me , i found out that `` fascists live in estonia '' only recently . 
  and i 'm sure that many of my friends do n't know it, 
  i like how polish ( and other slavic languages ) sounds , but it is too monotonously . 
  i 'm really do n't understand how your can speak everyday on language with too many hissing sounds, 
  i feel like i 'm living in 1984 when only jihadists on the other side can somehow justify authoritarian type of board and war versus separatism .

  if you imply the last part , then its not like this is unprecedented practice to protect your assets/puppets / `` our guy there '' . 
  human rights violators , people accused of serious crimes at home quite often find shelter in the west in general with the help of * money * , 
  good thing you ca n't read comments on russian/ukrainian from ukrainian sources , on ukrainian news or videos then , its quite a spectacle and `` civilized '' conversation  ( but then again youtube comments are generally shit and internet is a place for shitposting , flame wars in some peoples mind ) . 
  as for ukrainian army , i would agree if ukrainians * had an army * , not rag tag nationalistic batallions with no serious military training or knowledge of `` art of war '' . 
  you need time , money and equipment to properly train artillery , pilots and others , ukraine is lacking in that regard imho . 
  france has denounced united kingdom , 
  he is implying that russia in its evil genius has infiltrated azarov , pshonka and yanukovych as sleeper agents in ukraine decades ago and in its `` genius '' russia has said to those puppets to promise ukrainians a deal to join eu trade agreement , encouraged a notion of association with european union ( to become a member state ) , advised to shoot people on maidan , install draconian anti-protest laws etc etc etc. 
  some ukrainians believe that this is true ... 
  if you are a call of duty guy then : `` the numbers , mason !, 
  what do they meaaan ? '', 
  type of thing . 
  * allegedly * blew up a civilian airliner , investigation is underway afaik ( although initially i thought the same ) . 
  i would like to contest the notion that they do n't care who get hurt in the process though , because the downed liner generated a shit ton of attention and pressure on them . 
  prior to the `` event '' no one really cared about ukrainian conflict , after is quite a different story . 
  ukrainian official statement does not automatically prove that this is the doing of `` separatists '' , in fact if previous statements is any indication , its quite the opposite . 
  stop being a victim of information war , ukrainians bullshit just as much as russians . 
  to literally invade other sovereign states you need a considerable occupation force ( not just 100-200k troops ) + broad-wide support from the population . 
  russian support for war in ukraine was ( last time i checked ) ~ 8 % . 
  that is not to say of all the other shit you will need , including ** extremely rapid ** deterioration of trade and political ties will almost entirety of globe ( even less money , goods , technologies etc ) . 
  as of right now , russia is so-so , kind a stupid and weird in its actions with its * somewhat stealthy * war in ukraine , but nothing really that outrageous or insane as in occupation , deportation and all the other stops . 
  there is a difference in support of putin ( i would argue that 85 % number is bullshit in one way or another , but i ca n't prove it and its just a general feeling that the picture which is portrayed by polls is inaccurate/misleading ) . 
  nonetheless russians may see putin as somewhat ok ` ish figure in our * current political climate * , but there is very little support for actual war . 
  last couple things - 1st i would like to give 3dom a benefit of the doubt in his `` forecast/vision '' and point out that he ( in the same way as i am ) is just a random russian netizen , thus he can easily be just as wrong as any other guy . 
  flair does not give an immediate prove that the person who is speaking is in fact knows what he is talking about or has any sort of `` insider knowledge '' of situation inside russia . 
  if its offensive i would like to apologize , but he states that he wrote a blog , but can not provide proof of that because he is in russia ( which implies he is scared for his life , which is fair i guess ) , but at the same time he is leaving russia from what i can remember for at least half a year already . 
  last point , current russian developments * in my personal opinion * has more to do with crushing local dissent in an ** extremely ** troubled economic times ahead . 
  russian economy is in trouble , has been for a while before ukrainian events , there is * very little * faith in possibility of russian government to solve those problems , thus - standard of life will decrease -  dissent will rise -  you need to prepare to crackdown on protests , internet , civil society , hungry people -  you create a shit ton of oppressive laws , raise taxes on everything and follow a general `` hardline '' all for the sake of preservation of power and money . 
  reputational ? 
  whatever the word , no significant damage for european union image on international scale . 
  in case of ukraine , eu/u . s/imf & co had the incentive to back you guys up because people were dieing under flag of european union and for the trade deal with them , so if you bail out on such `` sacrifice '' ( even if it was unwanted for example ) , you loose face in one way or another . 
  that sort of thing . 
  as of right now , nothing outrageous or really interesting happened in hong kong , so eu prefers to stay quiet . 
  if you would remember arab spring even united states initially claimed quite a neutral position and backed `` revolution '' only after significant violence broke out and some `` stuff happened here and there '' . 
  a natural development for pretty much any political or economical event , the smartest thing is to look how things work out and then `` provide statement '' . 
  name of the source is quite funny in my opinion  nonetheless , there is nothing to gain for eu either economically or politically via backing of the protesters , no considerable reputation damage as of ** this moment ** either . 
  cloud storage for anything even remotely valuable/incriminating is beyond stupid . 
  at least cloud storage guys + intelligence agencies would always had access/means to browse the content . 
  scales of economy and problems accumulated are incomparable imho . 
  you could react , restructure , reform and pull out ahead eventually so fast , because you are relatively small , which means its easier to navigate or achieve consensus between parts of population . 
  big countries = big problems is usually the name of the game . 
  kind a ironic and sad at the same time . 
  europeans wonder why shiites kill sunnis and suicide bomb each other in 21st century , civilized european society my ass : / same cave dwellers with tribal system of identification as 5k + years ago . 
  its probably too late to respond , but anyway - out of pure curiosity what did you expect top european politician ( arguably most influential ) to say publicly : `` we are definately , 100 % going to abandon russian energy supplies effective now ! '', 
  ( you can add `` fuck russia ! '', 
  for contrast as well with middle finger showing to camera for threatrics effect ) and a following up on that question , how would russia react lets say in late september to public denouncation and borderline break of trade ties ? 
  sometimes i wonder about the age of commenters here or their image of how international politics work . 
  its not like nato was not expanding prior to ukrainian conflict or did not had plans for that either : / not that russia has any right to complain though , since we lack in terms of `` positive message '' for the world in any way , shape or form . 
  as it turns out criminal oligarchy with complete disregard for freedom of speech , human rights and other `` useless shit '' is not that popular in the world . 
  who woulda thought ? 
  if you come with friends ( 100k + ) obviously - winter , 
  its not like war would not resume after winter : / ( if truce holds until then anyway ), 
  a tool is a tool . 
  no one expects russian liberation !, 
  ( almost as good as spanish inquisition ) ukrainians certainly did n't see us coming :d, 
  how should i put this ? 
  current russian economic model ( sell recourses , produce nothing ourselves , import a shit ton of essentials ) has reached its peak/very close to it , thus russian standard of life will no longer improve . 
  if you take into account annual inflation in russia of 7 + % , it in fact will decline . 
  ofc this is ** extremely oversimplified ** , but russian economy is in deep shit and first signs of that development were seen even in 2013 before any ukrainian events . 
  at first it would be blamed on sanctions/west/insert excuse here , then when excuses will no longer work/fly with population government will crackdown heavily on any dissent ( whats going on right now is pretty much nothing compared to things to come lets say 4-5 years from now on ) . 
  if you need comparisons - authoritarian state with extreme control from security apparatus , qaddafi , assad and others come to mind , maybe a bit `` lighter '' . 
  the reason i am optimisticly pessimistic is that i have seen how russian government and economical bloc works , what sort of reforms are being implemented , their success rate , accuracy of forecasts , general direction of proposed laws , `` professionalism '' of business & banks + a general idea how population will react to any of the `` new great ideas bestowed on population from olympus '' . 
  pretty much zero faith that anything would be reformed in any meaningful way or that population will embrace any of the changes is a political reality in russia . 
  obviously no one is going to reassess our rearmament programs , dozens of billions of $ thrown into world cups , `` mega projects '' by state-run companies and other `` investments '' . 
  thus russia is destined to fail in one way or another , as russia will grow weaker , geopolitical situation inside and outside of russia will dictate significant changes in russian sphere of influence so to speak . 
  first places to look would be loosing grasp on central asian republics and big troubles in eurasian union ( whatever that thing was called anyway ) . 
  after that its a free-for-all , i can see caucasus being on fire again , if you ask will syberia/far east try to breakaway the answer is no . 
  as for event horizon id say next 5 years is crucial for survival of russia in its current incarnation , if we fail , then i can see same problems that plagued russia in xx century making a spectacular comeback and history might repeat itself  ( so overall a 10 year time lag ) . 
  that russia is an eternal monolithic block with hivemind like system and everyone here wants soviet union back . 
  things are complicated here and our current mental image reminds me of america in early iraq invasion ( silence of opposing views via thuggery methods is also a thing , because russia : / ) . 
  propaganda purposes ? 
  to promote `` more balanced view '' among local minorities which is not originating from kremlin ? 
  overall , a precautionary measure against future appearance of `` polite green men and their supporters '' , although i doubt that anyone will buy any of this shit anymore , but you can never be too safe i guess  not bad from political standpoint either . 
  ** a lot ** of russians act online like xbox kids - obnoxious , loud , rude , constant swearing and mums involved , act extremely stupid/retarded and very often try to ruin the fun for others . 
  normal russians try to keep low profile or communicate not as much and generally try to be less associated with `` them '' . 
  this is basically an illustration of russian : `` the main problem of runet is schoolboys '' . 
  ofc not every single one of them , yada , yada , but you should get the idea - the general cultural level of runet is pretty low , flame wars , name calling , people 's moms involvement , constant negativity etc etc. 
  at least this is my understanding of how westerners feel mixed with my own thoughts . 
  it would be nice if this sub had north korean flair so i could celebrate with everyone the direction in which russia currently is going , 
  is this germany without prussia ? 
  pathetic !, 
  maybe we should lend konigsberg to you for a couple of years , so that instincts would kick in and we could get the party rollin , 
  embrace the dark side !, 
  you know you want to !, 
  paging germany and austro-hungarian empire : `` guys , we got some partitioning to do '' . 
  not bashing russia ? 
  not making ridiculous claims or retarded comments by ukrainian `` officials '' ? 
  russia is not portrayed as a stupid barbarian who is hell bent on world conquer and will claim eastern europe tomorrow ? 
  what is wrong with you op , why ca n't you fit in and discuss the best possible ways to split russia , so that those pesky russians will know their place ? 
  i guess this sub is a simple example how quickly even somewhat educated group of people can change and `` peace of our time '' or `` we are so interconnected in global trade , war is impossible and an unreal thought '' is just wishful thinking/delusions . 
  just like pre-ww1 world , 
  as soon as countries will learn about the `` program '' a number of `` incidents '' will occur , with lethal outcomes most likely . 
  people in power who authorized the decision would either loose everything or have an accident themselves . 
  ukrainian nuclear facilities will be closed down and dismantled/cease to operate + no one will provide nuclear materials either . 
  nukes/bio/chemical weapons are no joke and such activities are closely monitored by all parties involved i am 99.999999 % sure about that . 
  this is not mythical terrorists/vials of anthrax in un by mr.powell , this is serious global security risk and no interested `` party '' would want to deal with ukrainian made nukes/chems/bio weapons on the loose . 
  old history with a lot of bankroll/help by major powers during geopolitical tensions/clash of interest ? 
  nukes are a problem , especially in unstable states , ukraine is far from stable as it is . 
  adding up even more headache and variables into equation of mad is hardly a sound strategy or the one with which major powers ( you can argue here that russia is a banana republic and so on , but we still have operating intelligence services and know-how in nuclear proliferation ) would like to deal with in the future . 
  it also would create a considerable amount of `` complications '' with other states , who desire to acquire `` security '' . 
  general rule of thumb is - `` do not make things harder , than they already are '' or create unnecessary security risks in the future .

  so lithuania is supporting russia ? 
  damn , i had better opinion on you ... how dare you country to have any relations with russia ? 
  you 're betraying your own history by doing it . 
   the argument is that ukraine will be fucked , why ? 
  why ukraine will be fucked by ns2 ? 
  there 're no logic behind this . 
  why does ukraine supply money to russia by allowing russian owned companies to operate in ukraine ? 
   i do not blame ukraine for taking gas from the supplies meant for germany after being cut off by russia . 
  but they have been doing it before `` cut off from russia '' . 
  they just plain simple stole russian gas , that was the main reason why russia cut it off in 2009, 
   taking into consideration russia 's aggressive actions and rhetoric towords the entire western world , which words exactly ? 
  why does religion organisation take part in official visit ? 
  is n't georgia a secular country with no state religion ? 
  did georgia pay for they arrive from budget ? 
  not your stranger , tovarishch, 
   until ns was a thing , russia had to find deal with them to transfer to we markets . 
  yeah because ukraine and poland are shitty trade partners who brings history and ideology into business, 
  germany is n't even in un sc, 
   usa did n't get involved in syria lol , us troops are literally fighting in syria, 
   excuse me , what ? 
  have you ever heard of words \u043c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438 ( moskali ) or \u043a\u0430\u0446\u0430\u043f\u044b ( katsapy ) ? 
  the ukrainians love to hate on the russians , your news are filled with how terrible russia is and how everyone here is literally anti-ukrainian and dugin supporter . 
  do n't delude yourself . 
  draw any conclusions you want, 
   nobody hates the ukrainian people , only their democratically elected government is a nazi fascist junta . 
  i 'm pretty sure many ukrainian hate their government too  nobody hates the ukrainian people , but those cretin inhabitants of ukraine - who are not actually ukrainians , because those are beautiful people - must be freaking killed off linking to freaks like dugin does n't help, 
  oh , i have google maps for this . 
  / r/russian, 
   do you even watch tv ? 
  no and i do n't recommend you . 
   have you seen video from samara where alcoholic charges on old lady ? 
  he yells `` bandera '' because it 's first negative thing that takes form in his vodka-flooded mind . 
  no , but i 've seen this video from ukraine https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prlgwpe2o_i  or did you visit any russian youtube video ( non-politicla non-ukraine related ) where in comment sections people start throwing shit on ukraine ? 
  or just randomly open youtube and see videos with '' \u0445\u043e\u0445\u043b\u044b '' in title in suggestions ? 
  i did n't . 
  all i see is \u041d\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 20 ! 8 comment getting upvoted, 
  what 's `` the western world '' ? 
  usa , germany or poland ? 
  4chan is indeed part of modern western culture . 
  so you say it 's obvious but can not prove it . 
  nice . 
   that 's quite a shift from `` factually incorrect '' to `` irrelevant , even if correct '' :d you 're making shit up . 
  both my map and cia map show that article statement is incorrect . 
   ask yourself , why were you bothered that irrelevant details might be factually incorrect ? 
  `` irrelevant details '' in this article are used as facts to criticize russia , therefore `` irrelevant details '' are n't irrelevant , they are essential part of this article . 
  by debunking them , i debunk whole article . 
  you 're whataboutist about whataboutism, 
  i tried to listen to them , hell , i myself was one of them , but then i discovered english speaking internet , 4chan and reddit , and this changed my perception of the west forever . 
  i do n't believe in the holy free west anymore , where everyone is rich and everything is working right , it 's literally the same shit as russia when it comes to approaches and government-people relationships . 
  it 's the same propaganda in media and us vs them mentality . 
  call them whatever you want , but i think most of them are just edgy teens and teen-like adults, 
   the article is from 2015 . 
  thanks for paying attention for it . 
  it 's explains a lot . 
  but still , unemployment rise was n't comparable to 2008 crisis . 
   ahah , i see that all the time on reddit alone and there are plenty of russian articles hating on ukraine and even calling them nazis . 
  hating ukraine is not the same as hating ukrainian people , and calling some ukrainian people nazis is not the same as calling all ukrainian nazis . 
  can you please link some russian articles there all ukrainians are called nazis ? 
  even if it 's true , what does it tell to us ? 
  does it mean what russian authorities are the worst authorities in the world ? 
  does it mean that russians has the lowest quality of life ? 
  no and no . 
  crude death rates do n't tell us a lot , while this article present it like some serious problem . 
  i 've already made 3 comment in this thread after just looking in the middle of article . 
  should i continue ? 
  it 's not my job to disprove any anti-russian shit written in the internet, 
  no because it 's factually incorrect in many nuances and overall of bad quality . 
  there 's a good share of russians who always shit on russia , no matter what, 
  hypocrisy is one of the most used propaganda method by everyone, 
   the country 's mortality rate is the highest in europe , with only afghanistan and sixteen african countries ahead of us worldwide . 
  this is factually incorrect , [ see map of death rate in the world ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/death_rate_world_map.png ) . 
   when , because of our incompetent authorities , prices for consumer goods skyrocket and unemployment grows , [ consumer prices skyrocketed ? 
  realy ? 
  ] ( https://tradingeconomics.com/russia/consumer-price-index-cpi ) [ unemployment ? 
  ] ( https://tradingeconomics.com/russia/unemployment-rate )  and people can not change the government or hold it to account , they direct their frustration at the us president , or the ukrainian people . 
  ukrainian people ? 
  really ? 
  i did n't see any anger on ukrainian people , maybe authors will provide some examples ? 
  ^ ( but they will not , because there 's no anger on ukrainian people in russia ), 
   russian foreign policy is renowned for its focus on the binaries of ` friend against foe ' : our people against the foreigners , patriots against traitors , russia against europe . 
  this formula is the basis for our national ideology , and gives our political elite carte blanche to do away with independent thought . 
  wow , how unice !, 
  clearly russian invention !, 
  these damn russkies always were good at inventing new propaganda methods !, 
  what does `` the real great white north '' mean ? 
  yeah maybe ukraine should stop being shitty trade partner, 
  we do n't know how widespread this practice were, 
  what do you mean by `` really oppressed '' ? 
   you and notreallytbhdesu are claiming that the national languages in the russian empire were not oppressed at all . 
  i 've never claimed such thing , stop making shit up, 
   our language was banned under their rule , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_press_ban  the lithuanian press ban ( lithuanian : spaudos draudimas ) was a ban on all lithuanian language publications printed in the latin alphabet in force from 1865 to 1904 within the russian empire , which controlled lithuania at the time . 
  lithuanian-language publications that used cyrillic were allowed and even encouraged . 
  you also claim that  just writing or owning a book written in the latin alphabet could get you either killed or banished to siberia . 
  which is total bs , of course ( as usual ) :  during the years of the ban , 3,047 people ( 829 smugglers , 859 distributors , and 1,359 persons possessing banned books ) were arrested in connection with the ban . 
  so , only 160 people were expelled , and only some of them to siberia , and about 40 people were sentenced to prison terms . 
  does n't sound like '' just writing or owning a book written in the latin alphabet could get you either killed or banished to siberia . '', 
  if you do n't believe russian wiki because reasons , here 's a quote from lithuanian wiki :  per draudimo laikotarp\u012f caro vald\u017eia sulaik\u0117 vir\u0161 3000 \u017emoni\u0173 , i\u0161 j\u0173 nubaud\u0117 apie 2000 . 
  which means 3000 were arrested , 2000 out of them were fined , right ? 
  [ eastern germany was poor than western since their formation , however , eastern germany had slightly higher grow rates ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_german_democratic_republic#comparison_with_the_west_german_economy ), 
  radislav , that 's how we call them in slavik lands !,

  ukrainians list genocidal stuff against ukrainians , like denying access for peasants to railroad stations , adding some 99 % ukrainian villages to genocidal `` black sheets '' , while russian historians disagree , pointing out that it happened also in other regions , and that it was n't proven that there was any difference in treatment of ukrainian and non-ukrainian territories . 
  ukrainian historians noted interesting stalin 's telegram from november 1932 : `` 15.40 telegram to mendel khataevich . 
  politburo cc vkp ( b ) currently discusses question about ceasing supplying __ ukrainian __ ( underlined by stalin ) villages with food and other supplies . 
  same day . 
  the politbure decided to cease ... '' ok , i got tired translating all this stuff . 
  i got from this discussion that ukrainian side have at least some arguments that the famine targeted specifically ukrainians , and russian historians are not entirely honest and to some extent ideologically motivated , ignoring facts that do n't fit their narrative . 
  but overall it 's not that simple . 
   or is it because the italian government thinks putin 's actions in syria are somehow wise ? 
  lolfuckingwat ? 
  of course , russian actions ( the country is called russia , not putin ) in syria to defeat western-backed salafi jihadists and support the only legitimate power in syria are wise . 
  thanks to russian actions ordinary people in damascus and aleppo would no longer live under constant bombardment from improvised mortars of terrorists . 
  thanks to russian actions ordinary syrian women would be able to walk around without hijab . 
  thanks to russian actions , christians , kurds , shia , etc. 
  would not live under danger of taken over by western-type democrats from al-qaeda . 
  thanks to russian actions , this war actually will end , to the great disappointment for various foreign backers who wanted to create new country perpetually at war like afghanistan . 
  so what is russia doing so evil ? 
  crimea ? 
  it 's not related to italy in any way or form . 
  italy recognized kosovo , so it 's sorta mega-hypocritical for them to not only _ not recognize _ , but _ sanction _ other country for essentially the same thing , but done in clean bloodless way . 
  anyway , the crimean sanctions were pretty light . 
  it 's not related to italy in any way or form . 
  and , ok , i entirely understand these sanctions in 2014 or 2015 -- indeed russia deserved blame for the things it did back then . 
  but since then minsk ii accords were signed . 
  russia respects it , there was not a single offensive of dnr/lnr since then . 
  ukraine on the hand declines to move forward , doing its part of the agreement ( changing constitution , agreeing on elections in dnr/lnr , etc. ), 
  -- but it 's neither sanctioned nor significantly pressured by the eu . 
  so what else should russia do ? 
  russia ca n't adopt necessary amendments to the ukrainian constitution on its own , ukraine should do it . 
  anyway , intensity of the conflict dropped \\* drastically \\* since signing minsk ii . 
  the graph of destroyed armored vehicles gives the general idea : http://lostarmour.info/analytics/ it would be reasonable if russia would get some sanction relief for that . 
  do you know that the georgians recently killed almost 20 % of its population ? 
  in 2013 in georgia lived 4.5 m , in 2014 - 3.7 m. 
  and all they needed to commit this mass murder was just to conduct census , the first one since 2002 . 
  turns out every 6th person was a dead soul , existing just in imagination of statistical authorities . 
  this level of discrepancy is just mind-boggling , but discrepancy of population against estimates is usual , at least in ex-ussr , it happens like every census . 
  state statistic services usually underestimate migration . 
  so comparing ukrainian estimates ( 13 years since last census ) with russian census is comparing apples with oranges . 
   russian only grows about 40-50 ,000 , which i ca n't put down to anything more than natural growth what natural growth ? 
  ukraine is one of the fastest dying countries . 
  population of ukraine dropped from 48.7 m in 2001 to 45.3 m in 2013 . 
  population of crimea ( without sevastopol ) dropped too , from 2024k in 2001 to 1959k in 2013 ( according to ukrstat , which can be an overestimation ) and 1891k in 2014 russian census . 
  so if russian population grew instead of declining , it can be attributed to the people switching their ethnicity , reported as ukrainians in ukrainian census , reported as russians in russian census . 
  edit : note that there is nothing usual in these switches . 
  after the collapse of the ussr , it happened in the opposite direction in ukraine . 
  ukraine 1989 - 37.4 m ukrainians , 11.4 m russians . 
  ukraine 2001 - 37.5 m ukrainians , 8.3 m russians . 
  people want to identify themselves with titular nation . 
  and obviously very few in crimea want to identify themselves with their crazy neighbor , especially after all the ridiculous stunts of the angry loser like cutting out electricity . 
   they did leave . 
  no , they did n't . 
  find me this 200k-strong exodus . 
  [ ukrainian officials ] ( http://www.dsns.gov.ua/ua/mizhvidomchiy-koordinaciyniy-shtab.html ) report 1039k refugees from donbass and 23k refugees from crimea . 
  22768 , so around 1 % of crimean population . 
   large part of the ukrainian population left they did n't leave , they just identified themselves as russians in russian census . 
  very few people actually physically left crimea -- there are few idiots to emigrate from russia to ukraine . 
  it should be noted that these 17 % of crimeans self-identified as ukrainians do n't support ukraine , they are ukrainians of pro-russian sort . 
  they speak russian and support reunification with russia . 
  there were at least two polls of crimean opinions per enthicity . 
  [ in gallup 's poll ] ( https://www.bbg.gov/wp-content/media/2014/06/ukraine-slide-deck.pdf ) 68 % of crimean ukrainians recognize legitimacy of the referendum , in [ the open opinion 's poll ] ( http://openopinion.ru/content_res/articles/oo_crimea_brief.pdf ) 84 % of crimeans self-identified as ukrainians supported reunification . 
  the least supportive ethnicity is crimean tatars , but even they are 50/50 approximately . 
  that 's entirely fine for us , just stupid . 
  you are free to act silly in mutually damaging way , of course . 
  anyway , sooner or later , we will keep crimea and no sanctions . 
  it seems you are busy watching historical movies . 
  the ruble is growing . 
  lol , why the hell would we gift crimea to ukraine again , if more than 90 % of crimeans want to stay in russia ? 
  crimea is a part of russia and it will stay part of russia . 
  you 'd better to suck it up already . 
  yes , it was organized by russia and it violated some agreements . 
  that 's a significant simplification , but it 's mostly true . 
  however , that 's also true that kruschev transfered predominantly russian region to ukraine like it was a bag of potatoes , that crimeans always sought independence from ukraine , that ukraine imposed on crimea some imperialistic ukrainization policies , and that ~ 90 % of crimeans support reunification with russia . 
   the victims were chechen militants accused of the bloody bombing of moscow 's domodedovo airport earlier that year - an attack in which 37 people died and 170 were injured the fuck am i reading . 
  `` the victims '' , really ? 
  well , after support salafi jihadist 's cause in syria by the western press , i should not be surprised . 
   on the morning of 10 december 2014 , an uzbek cleric , abdullah bukhari , arrived at a madrassah , an islamic school , also located in the zeytinburnu district of istanbul . 
  bbc paints him as some sort of dissident ( opponent of the regime !, 
  ) , but in fact he was a jihadist preacher . 
  rfe/rl article on this guy : http://rus.ozodlik.org/a/27814208.html `` he preached that for muslims ( including muslims of uzbekistan ) it 's a holy duty to participate in jihad against assad 's regime '' , `` bukhari openly claimed that if he would be forced to choose between kufr countries and the islamic state that lives under sharia law , he would select the islamic state '' . 
  he was a member of the [ islamic movement of uzbekistan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_movement_of_uzbekistan ) that merged into the isis recently , but then he was kicked out of it , because he stole some money or something like that . 
  the same article claims that hundreds or even thousands uzbeks went through bukhari 's islamic schools . 
  no wonder there are so many uzbeks fighting in syria . 
  [ this article ] ( https://regnum.ru/news/polit/1881046.html ) in russian media says he was one of the key figures in recruiting uzbek fighters for syria and iraq -- i do n't know if it 's true , but it 's pretty easy to believe . 
  obviously , bbc do n't see any problem that turkey is a safe harbor for people like him . 
  i do n't see a link with russia though . 
  no , i totally do n't mind our special services knocking out this guy , it would be nice , but i just do n't see a link . 
  two persons were convicted for this assassination were an uzbek and a turk . 
  russian involvement never was proven . 
   but what interest could russia possibly have in organising the assassination of opponents of the uzbek regime ? 
  mark galeotti says that by `` being a good friend to tyrants in the region '' moscow is able to maintain its authority . 
  putin was such a good friend to karimov that he did n't visit his funerals . 
  relations with uzbekistan never were great . 
  and they claim that russian special forces decided to assassinate personal enemies of karimov abroad just to be good friends with him ? 
  stupid , but good enough for an average bbc reader . 
   but refuse to believe that putin organized 2nd chechen war by bombing civilians oh , not that retarded shit again . 
  yes , i refuse to believe to that , because that 's just an idiotic conspiracy theory invented by berezovsky , when he was kicked out of the country . 
  this theory is not based on anything at all , there is not a single bit of evidence proving it , but conspiratards are going around with it like it 's a proven fact . 
  wahhabi jihadists from caucasus committed numerous bombing attacks before and after apartments bombings , they took children as hostages , they kidnapped and beheaded british engineers in 1998 , they invaded dagestan in july 1999 and beheaded russian pows , and so on , and so on . 
  for some conspiratards do n't care about all this stuff , for some reason they only care about 4 terrorist attacks in 1999 . 
   the evidence of military explosions found in one of appartment buildings that havent been detonated yet ? 
  those were poorly organized exercises .

   yes , and the poles which had the misfortune of remaining on the soviet side of the border after the riga treaty simply vanished into thin air one day . 
  so you just take data from 1926 census compare it to 1939 and the difference - all executed . 
  ignoring important migration processes outside soviet union ? 
  and also people changing their passport data for political reasons , like the jews did in many cases or ukrainians/russians ? 
   and coincidentally , those bodies were identified as belonging to missing since 1939 polish officers taken pow after the soviet invasion of poland . 
  i wonder what on earth could possibly happen to them !, 
  erm ... you are aware that only a handful of bodies were identified from almost 10 000 found . 
  and that there were labour camps with polish prisoners nearby . 
  it does n't mean that soviet army/government ordered to execute them . 
  more likely when they were left behind - germans did the job , and later on when they needed propaganda they ` discovered ' them 2 years later , maybe even added someone . 
  from there even the name ** katyn ** , while it was just a village there , but not the closest to the mass burials , name clearly chosen for polish readers from abroad . 
  also there is the case of the bullets , if you actually read about the case in detail , etc. . .  i 'm glad you at least admit that soviets were the most faithful ally of nazi germany before 1941 , small steps , i 'm positively surprised . 
  soviet union was n't ally , because there was no alliance . 
  non-aggressive pact is not an alliance - france had one with them , and so did poland and much more when czechoslovakia was invaded . 
   precisely , 200-300 thousands would approximately amount to a single wave of soviet deportations . 
  unfortunately , there were four of them . 
  from the documents it is estimated that there have been 80-100 thousands osadniks , they were deportated/exiled to siberia with their families ( also not everyone ) . 
  which would amount to 200-300 thousands i told you before . 
  this is a guess . 
  a million clearly does n't correspond with reality . 
  i do n't support such thing personally . 
  but taking in account posterior events i think that it was n't the worst possible scenario for those people . 
  yey for us !, 
  let 's do more deals like that one . 
   110,000 murdered during the polish operation in 1937-38 that number is invented by anti-communist dissidents . 
  in katyn , or more precisely in koziy gori - the german occupational forces ` suddenly ' discovered piles of bodies 2 years after they took smolensk , just when soviet union started to win the war and started forming polish squads from the prisoner soldiers they had from 1939 . 
  later polish government using economical and other pressure forced russian government admit and repent such act with no factual basis . 
  so called prove of it was an extract from archives that proved that there were executions of polish prisoners . 
  and of course there were out of 600 000 initial captives in 1939 part were given to nazi germany under their listed request , more than 200 000 were let go , other military personnel were subjected to trial ( 1920 invasion and posterior concentration camps for soviet soldiers ) , and it is estimated that around 10-15 thousands were executed , but not in ` katyn ' . 
  the rest are so called ` deported ' , because prison or camps was not the only punishment under those trials , also exile to siberia . 
  not a million obviously ( [ 200-300 thousands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/osadnik ) ) . 
  i see so now polish historiography method is multiply every real number by 10-50 and write it down as if it was like that . 
   and that 's cool , but do n't expect us to perceive you any better than nazi germany then yeah , since we planned to enslave and annihilate you all , like with plan ost . 
  you can perceive us the same / s, 
   belarusians and ukrainians are not russians . 
  and if it was right for russia to claim their land from poland , then so was right for poland had to claim their lands from russia . 
  russians used their shitty claims to fuel their imperialism at the end of 18th century , and poles used their similarly shitty claims at the beginning of 20th century . 
  that 's the point . 
  obviously poland also had claims to those lands . 
  as we did in 1939 , 
   except for this all `` succession line '' thingy . 
  by the line of succession russian dukes from rurik family had 100 better claim . 
  it 's like russian emperor during time of partition of poland would said - i have right to succession to this , cos i have some gediminid blood in me or whatever . 
  the laws of succession applies from the country or region to be succeed , not other way around . 
  and you can not succeed a rurik dynasty while there are 2 other branches around . 
   post-mongol-conquest-rus were n't even conquered by poland in the first place galicia , then union with litwa , then multiple invasions to the east from when jagailo became polish king in 1386 . 
  so those are polish-lithuanian invasions and carvings of russia from that to 1618 . 
  it is also weak argument . 
  because you are saying : * well we did n't carve russia from 1316 to 1386 . 
  however those are our lands now , thanks lithuanians for conquering them . 
  also from 1386 to 1618 does n't count . 
  and galicia does n't count either * . 
   whether those statelets deserve the name `` russia '' is another issue , though i respect your right to see it that way even if i personally find it really silly . 
  because you have been submerged in polish historian paradigm , in which polska is jesus christ of europe , who just suffered from bully russia all of it 's history . 
  while in reality it was xiv-xvii our time to be bullied around , from xvii-xx yours . 
  also we are nation of conquerors and warriors , we do n't lie ourselves about that . 
  is just we ( and me personally ) do n't like that whining about poland in 1920 having some ` historical ' right to take disputed lands from russians/ukrainians , then in 1939 from czechs , then whine how evil soviet union stabbed polska in the back years later . 
   you also ca n't deny that ( excluding wars during the 17th century ) poland itself never `` carved '' any russian , ruthenian , rusyn ( or whichever name you prefer ) territory . 
  what you call inherited -- it is the same . 
  polish kings had no claim to galicia , it was usurped after the assassination of the last descendant of daniil of galich . 
  when a rurik governed city was left without it 's dynasty it was always passed to rurik from another branch . 
  this is the law , galicia law , our law . 
  and polish invasion on russia begun already in 1013 and continued at all times until 17th century . 
  be it as polish kingdom or polish lithuanian union . 
   it was simply called `` rzeczpospolita polska '' since 1791 , and the federal type of government was abolished , so bad shot . 
  it doesnt matter , it the same level of absurd argument . 
  '' * poland never carved russia , because we do not recognize medieval russia and russia that in posterity carved out poland as same state . 
  * '' well i can do the same and do not recognized newly formed poland in the 1920 's as successor and same state with historical poland . 
  same level of argumentation . 
  not that i approve of it . 
   as you have n't mentioned my actual point at all - that the polish state itself did not carve `` russia '' at any point - i 'll assume the impossible happened and my time wasted on arguing with russians on the internet finally paid off by them realizing they were wrong all this time . 
  yes it did . 
  if you can deny the continuity of russian state from 860 's to 1917 , then i can do the same argument with poland . 
  say russia did n't partition poland in 1790 's , because it 's was not the same poland , it was called polish-lithuanian unia . 
  what then ? 
   well , russia itself was created in 1500s by one of the remaining provincional golden horde tributaries , so it would be rather hard for them to become conquered by anyone before they even existed . 
  that is just made up . 
  russia never was a province of golden horde . 
  it 's dynasty comes from rurik himself and is the same that governed russia since 860 's until the death of last male direct descendant in 1591 ( with polish involvement i must say ) . 
  and regarding the tributes . 
  poland also paid tributes -- first to golden horde ( after 2 successful and 1 unsuccessful invasions ) and later to the crimean kaganate , and until partitions of poland to the ottoman empire ( but that was on and off thing ) . 
  even so as you can see in the map northern part of russia was not affected by mongols ( novgorod , pskov , toropets ... ) and some barely affected ( smolensk , polotsk , lvov ... ) . 
  the name itself russia is the latin version of rus and it is used in all chronics and documents at it is . 
  the name kievan rus was used by the contemproraries to denominate the kievan region of rus ( similar to novgorod rus , vladimir rus , suzdal rus ... ) or by some historians to denominate the period that kiev was capital of russia ( 882-1169 ) . 
   duchy of ruthenia , which probably also falls under your megalomaniac definition of `` russia '' was inherited by poland due to simple medieval succession laws ( after the plan of local nobles to kill their ruler backfired on them ) . 
  they just killed all the successors and usurped the throne . 
  by all medieval laws of succession galicia-volyn should have gone to ryrik family in vladimir . 
   nah , unfortunately for you 1772-1795 is where the train stops . 
  the pre-partition poland never took any lands from russia ( alright , we did take some in 1618 ... but you have reconquered all of them by 1667 , and already took some more on top of that ) . 
  indeed poland and lithuania carved russia from 1300 's until 1618 . 
  but you are wrong here , extrapolate those two maps : [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/rus-1113-1194.png/800px-rus-1113-1194.png ) over [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/ribbentrop-molotov-ru.svg/1052px-ribbentrop-molotov-ru.svg.png ) . 
  you can see that in medieval times the division between russia and poland was a line drown directly south from curonian lagoon ( lagoon between kaliningrad and lithuania now ) . 
  and that in 1939 slightly less was taken than that , but again those medieval maps are aproximate . 
   just like the russian empire invaded us about 110 years before the world war one started and annexed those exact same lands for itself . 
  we can go back and forth like that , if that counts as an argument now . 
  and those exact land were taken around 350 years before that from russia by poland and lithuania . 
  i already mentioned it [ above ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3fi50c/ukraine_court_permits_selfrule_for_prorussia/ctpqoxu ) , that does n't account even for 0,1 , maybe 0,2 % of all captives by ukrainian army . 
  if they are who they say they are . 
  you do understand the difference between supplying hardware , specialists and advisers , action which is at best could be called intervention . 
  with actual army being there which is called invasion ?

  ignoring the differences between societies is hardly an evidence for yours . 
  there are hardly any recent researches related to homosexuality in russia , so i ca n't link anything , but before generalising results of research of one society to another society , you should prove that those results can be generalised , that there are no key differences that prevent generalising . 
  and that has nothing to do with some `` russian exceptionalism '' : for the same reasons you ca n't just take and generalise us-based homosexuality-related research on the middle east , or india , or china . 
  not without proving that generalisation in this particular case is correct . 
   you are simply repeating assumptions without addressing the manifold logical and empirical objections i have raised and sourced . 
  and those `` objections '' relate to russian society how , exactly ? 
  or are you going to tell me that all societies are exactly the same , and research results from the us can be applied to russia , where position and view of the homosexuality is radically different ? 
   you do realize that this makes it even illegal to discuss this in a newspaper ? 
  this is a massive restriction of the freedom of expression without the slightest shred of evidence that there are any harmful consequences . 
  say thanks to the people trying to push their ideas through children . 
  this is a defensive reaction of society . 
   there is a difference between the letter of the law and how the law is enforced . 
  then may be pro-lgbt activists should focus their efforts on that , and not on pushing questionable info to children ? 
  maybe create some center for juridical help for the victims of injustice and oppression ? 
  because , you know , that would be a real help - if those issues were significant in russia , of course . 
   here is an idea : why not support families with children more ? 
  more investments into playschools , primary and secondary schools , and recreational activities for children . 
  and of course more support and better training and counseling programs for parents . 
  all of this is already being done , and this has nothing to do with people choosing childless `` gay way '' . 
  those issues are orthogonal , unrelated . 
   people do n't stay childless , because they suddenly feel `` gay '' . 
  they often stay childless , because they fear that children are a poverty risk ( which they often are due to a lack of support ) and that children will kill their careers ( which can happen , because companies are often not very child friendly ) . 
  again , those issues are orthogonal . 
  stable hetero couple can choose to stay childless , it 's their choice . 
  but if some bi chooses to follow their `` gay '' side , being childless is n't a choice ( and no , adopting a child is not equal to giving birth to one ) . 
  those are small percentages , but such factors have the tendency to add up . 
   true , we do n't know the long-term consequences yet . 
  we do n't know the long-term consequences of all the things we have n't tried yet . 
  that does n't mean we should never try something new . 
  yes . 
  that means that we should be careful . 
  and if some issue is affecting an entire society , we should be * real * careful . 
  i mean , what is wrong with russia not wanting to jump lgbt equality bandwagon ? 
   if we followed your logic , we would have never allowed the internet . 
  i mean , no one knew the possible long-term consequences of that . 
  never allowed , maybe not . 
  but having the internet proliferate without control already has at least one possibly negative outcome : we soon will be having to deal with the entire generation of people with seriously reduced attention span . 
  would you like to trust your life to a surgeon who ca n't live without checking facebook like each other minute ? 
   so in other words : no children are at risk , and the sooner lgbt parents are recognized , the better for everyone , including the children themselves . 
  social changes do n't come this quick . 
  imagine lgbt marriage and parents recognized in russia next week , what good can come out from that ? 
  those families and their children will be bullied to hell and back . 
   how exactly do you propose that societies change and progress if it is forbidden to talk about anything that goes against the current mainstream opinion ? 
  but it is * not * forbidden !, 
  all that is forbidden is promoting certain ideas to children . 
  go ahead and promote lgbt ideas to adults , that 's 100 % legal as long as you make sure that no child can access it . 
   this is just about not being discriminated against , harassed , hurt , or even killed simply for being how you were born . 
  all those things you 've listed are already illegal in russia . 
   in the end it comes down to this : no . 
  in the end , it comes down to two things . 
  first , 100 % homosexuals are rare . 
  most are bisexual to some extent . 
  meaning that in the society where a homosexual relationship is promoted as being completely equal to heterosexual one ( which is a lie ) , some people will choose biologically unproductive relationship . 
  second , while in the history of mankind there were all kinds of societies with different views on homosexuality ( some tolerated it , some even considered it natural , etc. 
  ) , i do n't think there were any societies which equalised homo - and heterosexual relationships to the point that there is possible not only to have homosexual family , but also raise kids in said family . 
  do you know possible long-term consequences of that ? 
  no , you do n't . 
  you ca n't , yet . 
   the idea of equality and tolerance is perfectly suitable for children . 
  yes , if it is promoted from within the society . 
  russian society is not ready for the idea of lgbt equality , it is struggling with mere tolerance . 
  trying to push foreign ideas through children is a cheap move , it 's just plain wrong . 
   to reiterate : there is not a shred of scientific evidence that you can `` make '' people homosexual . 
  also , there is growing evidence of genetic factors governing sexuality . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biology_and_sexual_orientation#sexual_orientation_and_evolution this evolutionary perspective is important because it further supports the idea of genetically determined sexuality . 
  it also demonstrates that homosexuality is not a threat to a population . 
  in fact , it might well be an advantage . 
  all of this has nothing to do with equality and tolerance . 
  you 're mixing up biology and social acceptance . 
   using `` propaganda '' to describe a civil rights movement civil rights movement ? 
  they are pushing their ideas to * kids * , for fucks sake !, 
  this is pretty much a definition of unethical . 
  [ propaganda : information , ideas , or rumors deliberately spread widely to help or harm a person , group , movement , institution , nation , etc. 
  ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/propaganda?s=t ), 
   why ban something that is noneexistent [ except it is existent . 
  ] ( http://tguy.ru/news/29/985.html ), 
  what . 
  you 're delusional . 
  this gay thing is n't even a topic , it 's non-existent in the russian media , how the hell it can be used `` to overcome social tensions '' ? 
  no , russians do n't hate gays ( most of us , at least ) , it is just considered unnatural , some kinky thing that is not to be showed to public . 
   his sentence is some public service . . what the ... how is this even possible ? 
  dude , do you even context ? 
    the fact that russia as an independent entity did n't even exist back then  is such a fucking bullshit . 
   c'mon , the soviet union was n't even led by a russian at the time . 
   yes , stalin was such a georgian nationalist that he proceeded to russify minorities in the soviet union . 
  ( implying that stalin was somehow pro-russian , in support of claim that the statement `` russia was n't independent back then '' is false ), 
  about 60 % of men and 20 % of women in russia smoke . 
  so yes , quite fashionable . 
  government tries to control it ( ads are forbidden , cigarettes must not be on the display in the stores , there are fines for smoking in public places ) , but i do n't think that it is going to change any time soon . 
  does n't makes it any better . 
  russians were just as oppressed as any other ethnicity in the ussr , they did not have any say , no more than ukrainians or khazakhs or whoever , so no , equating ussr with russia is just plain wrong . 
  he only used russian language and culture for his need because it was utterly unrealistic to `` georgify '' the entire ussr . 
  statistically , russians were the most oppressed ethnicity : the majority of gulag inmates and stripped of their possessions and relocated `` kulak '' farmers were russian . 
  :p do n't take it srsly , i was just joking . 
  i do n't want to harass you , i 'm asking for source on the quoted statement . 
  both links do not have enough information to support your accusations . 
   ** russian activists ordered stickers of swastikas , went to supermarkets and stuck them on products from baltic countries . 
  ** do you have trouble with reading comprehension ? 
   russian activists ordered stickers of swastikas , went to supermarkets and stuck them on products from baltic countries . 
  aaaand we 're reading source any second now , right ?

  why should women die in the dirt too ? 
  are the lives men give not enough ? 
  such a lust for revenge !, 
  whoooooooo ? 
  well yeah , that 's one thing reunited that had no good reason to be split . 
  additionally , the new entity is meant to become a ministry , which will take some of these smaller agencies out of direct presidential control , which is good .

  what a curious time to be alive . 
  should 've read the local news when ur tried to conduct their primaries this year . 
  the fraud shitstorm was hilarious . 
  i see liberal ideology leading to violent regime changes and civil wars . 
  it 's the same thing under a different sauce . 
  the leaders of the ideology that created this flag would slap putin in silence . 
  try to avoid mixing up the categories of sweet and pointy . 
  well yes , it was an ideology . 
  the research was n't about just any kind of an ideology though , but religion only . 
  that 's one good / s , since the question sounds quite sincere given / r/europe 's usual mindset . 
  shh , we 're supposed to be the big evil theocratic empire . 
  ( user was a magical unicorn for this post ), 
  yes . 
  we 're going to play a little game as well .

  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:full_grown_caucasion_shepherd.jpg https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/caucasian_shepherd_dog more than enough to scare anything that moves . 
  exactly . 
  no shit , therefore `` supposed '' . 
  they will create a martyr out of her . 
   there is no top-to-bottom command and control mechanism , preparation or training in place for the uk armed forces [ to defend home territory ] while this does sound grim if true , the only realistic threat from russia to uk is a strategic bombardment or two . 
  we simply border too many closer targets by land to get distracted building a major offensive navy that 's necessary to ever hope to land in gb . 
  they 're the ones responsible for almost every incident of such kind . 
  it 's supposed to be their job to regulate runet . 
  there are some serious agencies within our government , but rkn is far from being one . 
  * c'mon dude , he 's slavic , it 's okay to be racist . 
  russia is russia , but sadly , stereotypes are stereotypes as well .

  not that i 'm asking to live in a dirty hut . 
  they could 've succeeded at it if it was . 
  they simply need to validate their own importance while staying on hot political topics . 
  and once again i wonder how much more idiotic rkn can become . 
   domestically , putin 's `` managed democracy '' is stalinism thankfully , some of my family members are old enough to remember what the last word means , else wp 's memory hole would 've swallowed it for me . 
  do they though ? 
  it sounds kind of radical when people put it that way . 
  the saudis are their longtime allies , no point in doing so . 
  petrodollars may be worth more than potential arms exports , too . 
  in russian , you do n't even need pronouns to indicate a gender , since nouns , verbs , and adjectives all have gender-specific forms for male , female , and inanimate cases . 
  why not ? 
  destabilisation ensures that no political player above lightweight emerges from the area , as well as secures a weapons market . 
  given your home country is sufficiently isolated from the destabilized region to suffer no damage from primitive weaponry leaking out of it , it can benefit from the conflict endlessly .

  they can , they 're just either scared of the means required to achieve this goal or still believe they can lead people into a bright future with pure good will . 
  the core of his message sounds rational , despite the tolerant fluff around it . 
  homegrown religious authorities and government control over mosques via investments can turn islam from a rogue element into a tool of control over a part of society . 
  of course , such measures are incompatible with basic freedoms , but they work . 
  is fp a pro-putin media outlet , then ? 
  sure , but not the money . 
  i believe a comparison of total gdps shows the same results . 
  nukes , atomic icebreakers , thousands of tanks and artillery , spy networks all require money to sustain , leaving less for the infowars . 
  its predecessor was also quite a bit more powerful . 
  to assume that russia today equals to what ussr was would be disinformation itself , would n't it ? 
  and yet even if it stretches itself to the limit , it will only have a fraction of what its portrayed enemies have to offer . 
  the only thing i did n't quite get was how russia , often lauded as a failed state with a gdp of less than one california or italy , succeeds at informational warfare against a congregation of economical and media powers orders of magnitude more influential than itself . 
  username checks out . 
  edit : i guess an explanation is in order . 
  finding a monument to stalin is a problem . 
  stalin earned a lot of hate in literature . 
  even within the communists ' ranks , he is a controversial figure to say the least . 
  that 's how much russians love stalin . 
  there are some people that do , sure , but there are some people all around the world that love hitler or de sade or michael bay . 
   russia has turned the ukrainians against russia for at least a generation by what , selling them indecently cheap gas and ignoring incidents and statements that deserve an embassy withdrawal at the least ? 
   two wrecked cities that offer russia nothing save for a puny little naval base in the black sea that nato considered important enough for some reason to start screaming about european integrity and all . 
  gives them a break from their usual terrorism antics , i guess . 
  `` whatever it wants '' are your words . 
  do n't put them in my mouth . 
  you mean `` had '' , not `` has '' . 
  we 're talking about a fact . 
  accepted . 
  grand duchy of lithuania is welcome to come and try to take what it considers itself , 
  everyone does . 
  how convenient that history has already shown that a war on ideology is not easily won with steel . 
  reunification of what was whole once . 
  does n't necessarily threaten the central european regions . 
  which would require a disproportionate amount of power to hold on to . 
  where 's the profit in this ? 
  and what would russia gain from an offensive towards europe 's core ? 
  that 's the kind of question i should be asking you . 
  five conflicts in total , all of regional value , important ones compressed in a 30 years long interval .

  oh come on even among the diaspora his popularity is an all time high . 
  i saw what you did there ... 
  i am from russia , i have already the canadian citizenship , right now i am in canada but travel two , three times per month back to russia . 
  the last time i was in ukraine was last year . 
  oh come on !, 
  yes it is bad i admit it ( altough the russian translation is less harsh )  and i meant it might not seem like a big deal to a russian jew , not to you . 
  things are just a mess right now nobody like kolomoisky ( yes an ukrainian jew ) specially us he is basically the one financing halfly far right groups in ukraine . 
  relations are tense between us and them , some leaders in ukraine simply act like they dont have any brains . 
  its politics and no i am not a special case http://www.jpost.com/diaspora/hang-ukrainian-jewish-leaders-says-former-russian-jewish-congress-president-393774, 
  you never wrote something intelligent , the 1932 \u00e9lections is what allowed hitler to have his first coalition governement after the 1932 elections hitler got the largest share of the vote and approached papen ( the current governement in power ) for coalition talks . 
  papen agree and obtained hindenburg 's consent to form the hitler cabinet on 30 january 1933 . 
  this is free and fair from a to z, 
  at the end and i say that as a russian jew , the guy is using rethoric they are no report of opression from what i read on jewish forum and jewish reports in eastern ukraine and the own rabbis say that those people were correct . 
  he use using rethoric sure that is bad but they are no reports and i met plenty of jewish ukrainians in synagogue that say they are not opresss or come close to it . 
  * asked about rebel leaders ' relationship with the jews under their control in february , vishedski 's assistant rabbi aryeh shvartz told the jerusalem post that `` they have acted well toward us . '' *, 
   using paramilitary forces to expel communists from the parliament , manufacturing a majority , is not democratic . 
  there is a reason most european nations have laws against uniformed extremist groups these days . 
  yes it is . 
  using article 48 of the weimar republic wich was perfectly legal, 
   you do n't know what you are talking about ( and no historian would actually side with you on this ) . 
  wich ignorance ? 
  the fact you are not able to grasp a modicus of thing wich is a complete horseshit you just wrote hitler asked for article 48 ( not the first one doing it ) and he got his coalition furthermore he already won election before ( 1932 ) and his party came first . 
  you are sputting nonsenses and waisting my times i am seriously curious to see those sources wich you wont be able to provide at all . 
  his rise was perfectly legal using the democratic institutions from a to z. 
  are you realy trying to argue cold histrical facts that even historians dont bother to argue . 
  the day after the fire hitler ** asked for ** and received from president hindenburg the * reichstag fire decree * , signed into law by hindenburg ** using article 48 of the weimar constitution ** . 
  ( note that hitler was not the frist one using it ) wich was perfectly legal according to the institution of the weimar republic . 
  [ `` revisionism '' can also have a various denifinitions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/historical_revisionism ) dude , you are a romanian guy arguing on something that even the germans accept , that the allies recognize themselves and that modern historians accepted as cold historical fact . 
  it doesnt help that you are carefully trying to castigate russia ( assuming that russia was the only one doing that ) while the expulsion of germans was first push by the polish and the czech but nah it has to be `` kaliningrad '' but not the other territories . 
  russians dont take lightly this kind of crap . 
   and you think people should pay for the actions of their leaders ? 
  i 'd like to see you queue up to repay putin 's crimes against ukraine and georgia . 
  what crimes , genocide , atrocities putin did to the `` ukrainians '' and the `` georgians '' i have not heard of any massacres or crime agaisnt humanites toward both of those peoples . 
  all was done democratically there is nothing to argue here , not even historians bother to argue on that . 
  there was 43,9 % for the nsdap in the 1933 election was the best result any party had ever had in the republic of weimar from 1919 to 1933 ( second best was 37,8 % for the social democrats immediately after wwi ) in march 1933 the german parliament passed what is known as \u201e erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz `` ( gesetz zur behebung der not von volk und reich ) , a law that allowed the nazi/deutschnationale coalition to govern without the consent of the parliament . 
  it was passed with a vast majority of deputies that would have allowed to change the constitution in any case . 
  so , since hitler and the nsdap had more votes than any other party during the republic of weimar and governed on the basis of a law that had been passed by the absolute majority of the parliament is seems reasonable to conclude that he was indeed democratically elected . 
  those are hard true cold historical facts . 
   the atrocities of the nazi regime do not justify destroying the lives of ordinary people in konigsberg , and invading their land those are simply the `` potsdam agreement '' otherwise you better asked poland to give back also eastern prussia . 
   these people had nothing to do with the decisions their leaders made at the end the nazi were elect to power , took the power democratically . 
  `` the germans people bear all the guilt of wwii '' what the allies call `` collectiv guilt '' * the expulsion of germans after world war ii by soviets , poles and czechoslovaks has been sometimes justified as collective punishment . 
  the goal was to punish the germans ; [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] the allies declared them collectively guilty of german war crimes . 
  [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] in the us and uk the ideas of german collective guilt and collective punishment originated not with the us and british people , but on higher policy levels . 
  [ 24 ] not until late in the war did the us public assign collective responsibility to the german people . 
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collective_punishment#expulsion_of_germans_after_the_war keep your revisionism for yourself and i say that as a jew also . 
  its just a fair price !, 
   will you give us your last tank ? 
  please . 
  :3 ukraine problems was never lack of tanks or weapons since the beginning of the conflict . 
  if anything look the iraqi army you stop using your su fighters and attact helicopters as soon they were being shot down easily . 
  good, 
  lol, 
   a russian court can be coerced or bribed into allowing putin to seize random assets in retaliation is preposterous . 
  not only would he not be brave enough to do this http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/25/us-russia-sanctions-law-iduskcn0hk1eo20140925, 
   nice to see russian taxpayers ready to foot the bill for their poor oligarchs . 
  how is kolomoisky doing ? 
   it would make it unlawful . 
  if the russian state wants to behave like a criminal regime illegally stealing assets because it does n't wants to adhere to treaties they signed themselves , that 's their call . 
  yeah yeah right ... right ... http://mobile.reuters.com/article/iduskcn0hk1eo20140925  but actions always have consequences , there wont have nothing at all i was working as a financial trader in london when putin was cracking down foreign companies after yeltsin years left and right . 
  traders and commodity traders where not even worried soon after russia was still in the top 20 of foreign investment . 
  i predict nothing at all, 
   foreign property is protected by several international treaties , among which the partnership and cooperation agreement the russians federation has with the eu . 
  and you think that can a stop governement lol ? 
  by the way i will need links please of you dont mind . 
  exactly, 
   the turkish stream was just a bluff , in recent statement , even the prime minister himself said that they wo n't participate in anything before eu agrees with russia . 
  do you have any sources , the constrcuction are already begin next month at least on the turkish side . 
  tough ?? 
  yes its propaganda , putin at least since 2013 has already launched a massive plan of modernization of the army and the naval air forces and to get ride of the 1980s and 1990s old equpipments . 
  we need to close that gap at least fast . 
   this username is revealing things about this user 's views that match his actual comments . 
  what is wrong with his comment history ? 
   ugh looking at your [ reddit posting profile it 's obvious i 'm talking to someone from within the military industrial complex ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hdjx6to.png ) so i do n't expect your view on this to be anything other than highly subjective and biased ( if not bought ) how did you do that wich website ? 
  look lady , you cant understand a modicus of things oh by the way nice dodge on churchill and the uk keep ignoring it ( ** that was a real case of holocaust ** )  it is you who is spinning the crap out of your `` stalin crimes '' . 
  what ? 
  are you saying that stalin didnt do crimes ? 
  here the thing what happen fall under stalinist crimes , orders signed by him , ** now read below this paragraph in bold carefully * '' ** unlike germans , nobody in the whole , soviets union vote for the soviets regime and were also victims . 
  ** german voted for their crazy governement . 
  ** no wonder since the end of the cold war poland , the baltic states or eastern europe never brougt russia b to courts for apology or compensation . 
  ** why ? 
   instead of actually showing me where that has happened you 're spinning russian 's saying stalin was a bad guy and did bad things as a wholesale coverage for everything - which is simply insane . 
  russia have recognize stalinist crimes this is the last time i repeat , do you understand ? 
   it 's like instead of recognizing , apologizing and reconsiling the holocaust and other atrocities germany had just said `` okay , hitler was bad guy , and there 's that . '', 
  nothing like germany , putin has already recognized that the system was force on the baltic states and nothing like the holocaust and i know what i am talking about i am jewish . 
  if even the west can not even recognize their own , at the exact same period . 
   and then you guys whine because many dislike russia . 
  russia could do with some common decency . 
  i never whine , most people dont care of their opinion . 
  they never had a valid case to bring it to court or ask compensation . 
  basically its all rethoric to s ** ck the hell out of the votes ( ironically they all host cia black site )  over & out . 
  you never brought a single intelligent point  except for this one more stupidity of yours :( :( well you are asking for nonsenses that even western countries dont do and acting like germany was ussr or that the ussr was the only one kicking out and making slave labour in europe at that time . 
  [ the czech did some nasty things ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/forced_labor_of_germans_after_world_war_ii ), 
  here we go , there is no point in arguing with that  merely saying that stalin was bad guy is certainly not the same as actually recognizing * youuuuuuuuuuu are trying to spin ... * * right round * , * right round * the links are pretty clear russia leadership have ** recognized ** stalin crimes . 
   and if all those atrocities have been officially recognised as you claim then please do list them regarding poland . 
  list them right here : they all enter into stalinist crimes nobody is snowflakes specially not the poles . 
  * `` even now you can hear people say that what happened to the many victims was justified by certain higher government aims , '' said a sombre-faced mr medvedev . 
  '' * * `` but nothing can be placed higher than the value of human life . 
  there can be no justification for the repressions . 
  '' * * `` it was vital to remember and mourn the millions of victim '' * - medvedev or saying `` we force our way on other nations '' is not a recognition now ?? 
  those is clearly a recognition , as i told you quit spinning they got pretty far while in uk nobody apologize/recognize the 6 millions people that died under a famine that winston churchill enigneered and the british administration engineered themselves ( roughly the same numbers as stalin and deliberately ) http://yourstory.com/2014/08/bengal-famine-genocide/ http://www.ibtimes.com/bengal-famine-1943-man-made-holocaust-1100525**** * later at a war cabinet meeting , churchill blamed the indians themselves for the famine , saying that they `` breed like rabbits *  irrelevant to what putin said in your link nice cherry picking , that part is * today , cia black sites are not true now ?

  and hitler would hate him a lot more too , not that he did n't hate ussr enough already . 
  before wwii , the west was far more afraid of communism than fascism , communism was like a virus , it tried to spread everywhere and overthrow the ruling order . 
  if not stalin , then wwii may have started out with germany fighting russia and the west not being involved * until it was too goddamn late to to anything * . 
  west never wanted to fight germany anyway , look at appeasement and sitzkrieg . 
  west would have been happy if germany went to kill the communists . 
  jews and slavs would be exterminated and the west would stand by . 
  i know i am starting to sound bitter , but i do love the west , i love eu , i love what europe is now . 
  however , it took us a lot of history to get to where we are . 
  if stalin was replaced by trotsky or if russia stayed tsarist , i am positive history would have taken a much scarier course . 
  perhaps if someone else took power , it may have been different . 
   i actually had a discussion with one russian guy not so long ago and his argument was basically that gulags were just like modern prisons , only prisoners instead of being supported by a country actually work for it . 
  but all of them were convicted criminals and in general it was one of the best prison systems in the world . 
  most gulags were , to be fair . 
  just quite a few of the nazi camps were just labour camps . 
  the nazis had death camps though as well , which were for industrial death and concentration camps , which were aimed to kill everyone in them , work was an afterthought . 
  gulags were in general really harsh prisons where prisoners were put to work on important civic projects . 
  much of the stalinist economic miracle happened in a large part due to gulags . 
  the stalinist industrialisation is what allowed ussr to survive wwii and avoid total annihilation . 
  imagine if russia was still tsarist . 
  1941 germany was a far bigger menace than 1914 germany , and 1941 germany did n't have the western front , it just had the uk barely hanging on to power . 
  hitler would have steamrolled through 1941 tsarist russia and mass-murdered slavs to an unimaginable degree . 
  you and i would not exist , and neither would our parents . 
  **** * here is where he was wrong * . 
  gulags were obviously meant for political prisoners who were by all fair definitions innocent . 
  and for a lot of people who were jailed simply for making an off remark or being too wealthy . 
  my great-grandfather served 5yrs in a gulag , he was a * kulak * , or a rich ukrainian peasant . 
  well , in moldova , but it was northern moldova , briceni region . 
  and here is another problem : russians today are fed bullshit in heaps and they also want to believe some of it . 
  stalin was declared a * fucking asshole * by the soviet union of khrushchev . 
  not publicly , but it was known nonetheless . 
  his legacy was to be buried , not to be mentioned . 
  out of shame . 
  now putin brings him back into the spotlight , a positive one ... 
  i understand why putin is doing it , stalin was a strong leader . 
  however , he was an evil man . 
  putin knows this , but he does n't care , he uses him in his propaganda machine . 
  he whitewashes stalin 's crimes , denies them , minimises them , etc. 
  that being said , stalin did save ussr and by extension eastern europe from the nazis . 
  without his industrialisation ussr would have collapsed . 
  do n't delude yourself into thinking us would come to waste its men to liberate the entire continent of europe if it had no capable ussr to stand by it , a ussr that still held territory west of urals . 
  slavs and jews and all the other undesirable social groups would be exterminated . 
  does he deserve our praise for it ? 
  no , fuck stalin . 
  however , from a purely academic perspective , it 's still worth remembering that we owe our lives to him , as much as i hate the man and the shit he did to soil the soviet legacy into perpetuity . 
  imagine a ussr without stalin . 
  it would be just another run of the mill empire that improved a lot of things whilst committing imperialistic injustices , so not so bad in other words . 
  stalin however turned ussr into 'em pire of evil ' . 
  how the hell is russia just one nation away from being next to germany ? 
  low population density ? 
  i suppose i 'd have to read more into how they measure this stuff , because i do not understand how we are not worse . 
  keep tabs on them presumably and remember these things when giving opportunities for the kids to go to special summer camps or later on , making it more difficult for them to get promoted . 
  at least that 's what was sometimes done in the ussr . 
  even native latvians really ? 
  ussr has n't taught them anything ? 
  i mean , i 'm not exactly in love with the ukrainian gov ' t seeing how i 've spent enough time there to know how bad it is ( roughly yeltsin level ) but i mean , surely an invasion can make even a subpar gov ' t sympathetic ? 
  damn , where do you live ? 
  i was born in soviet chernovtsi just as it was about to become ukrainian , but i do n't have any family there , so have n't really visited since 2004 . 
  was kinda toying visiting ukraine as a holiday , really loved karapati , one of the most beautiful places in europe imo . 
  priorities mate !, 
  bet you 're jealous of our independence and how we 're one of the last two nations who can tell us to go fuck itself . 
  now are you gon na finish that restaurant meal ? ... 
  erdogan could only dream of obama 's sense and honour , or his intelligence ... on the other hand , he does not , his type do n't wish for those things . 
  anybody could do what erdogan did . 
  the question is , how much can you gain from doing so ? 
  if the us could do something that would actually unseat putin from his power , i 'd cheer them on . 
  but what can us do that 's constructive in the case of the su-24 flying over a ship ? 
  us never stopped doing fucky shit in the latin america . 
  after the cuban missile crisis , russia understood that it was us backyard . 
  russia will do fucky shit in the baltics . 
  such is life . 
  screaming about russia posturing in its backyard is naive . 
  calling for a shootdown makes you sound like a teenager with more hormones than brain . 
  what did machiavelli say ? 
  * `` upon this , one has to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed , because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries , of more serious ones they can not ; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge . 
  '' * shooting down a russian plane is a total destruction of relations with russia and one should only do it if they have a good plan of how to dismantle the current regime in russia . 
  otherwise you just escalate things and hurt both sides without gain . 
   `` moldovans '' , which is a stalinist propaganda invention for undermining the bond between romanians in bessarabia and the rest of the motherland . 
  belarusian and pretty much all of the central asian former ssrs are propaganda inventions of the 20th century . 
  ukraine is an invention of 19th century ( belorossiya sorta started in the 19th century too , but that was mostly the dialect being codified , belarusian nationalism was very limited to a few upper class intellectuals ) thing about it though , now that they 're countries , you ca n't really ignore them unless you 're agreeing with putin that crimea was a 100 % just takeover . 
  after all , crimea transfer was a propaganda invention of a 1950s ukrainian soviet dictator who did n't mind giving it away because it was never imagined that they would separate . 
  yeah , amen . 
  when i was in my early teens gryvna was 1usd = 5uah . 
  500uah was 100usd , well , slightly less , but almost there . 
  nice and neat , seeing how americans do n't circulate more than their benjamins anymore . 
  now it 's crazy when i go back to my hometown of chernovtsi ... 
  feels like monopoly money ... before you ask , rubles were always monopoly money to me as a kid , i was very much fixated on values of currency as a kid , even though in reality of course mainly the stability matters , not so much the value . 
  sadly my country is full of nationalistic morons who do n't read their history . 
  : / it 's doubly bad when you were a history major yourself ( but at an ami uni because studying history in russia is a joke ) . 
  we fucked up right where we did n't emulate germans in their treatment of hitler . 
  now stalin was n't quite as bad as hitler as you will learn in history , but stalin had more time so he had more impact . 
  we should have been taught to have been ashamed of him . 
  but he was swept under a rug and now that swept up rubbish is reappearing . 
  too bad communism could not admit one of its failures because now we are paying with dividends for it . 
  u should get a phd in polisci , they cud learn a lot from u. 
  or better yet let them keep their passports thinking they 're fine and then issue a warning to all law enforcement/border force officers to detain them . 
  then throw them on trial and then prison . 
  if you revoke their passport they just get stuck in syria where they will possibly plan more terror attacks . 
  i love how everyone on here acts some minor thing such as monitoring citizens ( which let 's face it , will always happen thanks to modern technology ) is literally dictatorship but literally dictatorship is perfectly okay because ` hurr durr let us kill dem terrorists ' . 
  you know how broad ` terrorism ' definition can become eventually ? 
  there is no reason to strip their citizenship if you could just give them life in prison .

  why else would our authorities need horror stories about `` gayrope '' ? 
  if you can not challenge the standard of living , just declare their living `` immoral '' . 
  there is also a cult of `` european '' goods . 
  everything labeled `` european '' is assumed to be of superior quality compared to russian and chinese things . 
  if it was easy , there would be a lot more russians in the eu . 
  if you have necessary qualification , it is possible to get a job offer . 
  for example , in academia , there 're a lot of russian migrants . 
  another rather easy way is through education . 
  several people i know are getting free education in eu universities at the moment , including one person in finland . 
  there is a difference between not liking putin and actively acting against him . 
  navalny 's brother is in jail , for example . 
  if i wanted only to make money , i would leave science immediately and switch to it . 
  i just do n't want to , science is more interesting to me . 
  i think most scientists are qualified enough to find a job with a better income , but it 's not about money . 
  shame on me , i did n't even know marie 's and pierre 's daughter was a scientist , not only a nobel prize winner . 
  there would be no albert without isaac . 
  classical mechanics is still an example of a wonderfully constructed theory . 
  and it 's still pretty much useful for most applications . 
  with his mathematical principles of natural philosophy , he completely redefined what science is , bringing mathematic formalism into it . 
  truly one of the greatest thinkers in the history . 
  in which way are they forced ? 
  it 's hard to tell which language should be the original one in case of kiev . 
  the city is too old . 
  the oldest source i could find a good digital version of ( laurentian codex of the 14th century ) spells it like '' \u041a\u0438\u0454\u0432\u044a '' ( kiev ) . 
  but i 'm not sure if it is in old east slavic or already has features of old russian . 
  the split between old russian and old ukrainian dates back to approximately this century . 
  spelling `` kiev '' has also been in use in english for centuries , it 's a historic language norm ; `` kyiv '' appeared in the 20th century and started gaining popularity since 1990s with diplomatic efforts by ukraine . 
  i personally do not like when countries decide how their toponyms should be written in foreign languages . 
  if i insisted on changing `` moscow '' to `` moskva '' in english , that would be ridiculous , in my opinion . 
  it 's actually '' \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432 '' in russian , '' \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432 '' in ukrainian , and `` kiev '' in english . 
  `` kyiv '' is a fairly [ recent trend ] ( https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=kiev%2ckyiv&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3b%2ckiev%3b%2cc0%3b.t1%3b%2ckyiv%3b%2cc0 ) which is far from being the language norm . 
  my point was to point out factually incorrect information , that 's all . 
  i believe that sticking to the facts is important . 
  if you want my opinion on this one law , i 've always strongly opposed it . 
  again , which ones ? 
  i know of a single federal law of 2013 , i do n't see any mentions of other nation-wide laws in this article either . 
   one homophobic law after another i remember only the `` gay propaganda '' one . 
  the rest of homophobia comes mostly from the rhetoric of media and officials . 
  the love between estonia and finland is so strong , the russian border connecting them still remains . 
  and we also have a small piece of land near kazakhstan left , yay !, 
  while chechens are russians , the difference between cultures of chechnya and the rest of russia is important in this case . 
  there are many transliteration systems of russian , a single standard does n't exist . 
  some of them are hideous . 
  e.g. , the variant used by our authorities for passports is just atrocious . 
  that 's actually a common problem , people can have slightly different names on several credit cards and in a passport . 
  not to my knowledge . 
  holy shit , his use of singular `` you '' was really disrespectful . 
  i would probably try to abandon the dialog with a person if they treated me like that . 
  churkin was way way better at speaking . 
  he said `` many , possibly most '' . 
  and i might be giving a low estimate , as i do n't have any data , just my impression . 
  i have never seen polls on beating , but 18 % think that gays should be persecuted , and additional 37 % think that they should be treated from illness . 
  [ source in russian ] ( http://www.levada.ru/2015/05/05/nevidimoe-menshinstvo-k-probleme-gomofobii-v-rossii/ ) . 
  i 'm fairly sure at least 20-30 % would openly support beating up gays . 
  the us , of course . 
  i do n't buy mustard . 
  heinz for ketchup , sloboda ( local brand ) for mayo . 
  is russia big ? 
  it was a person from india . 
  i guess [ banya ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banya_ ( sauna \\ ) ) counts as a type of sauna . 
  i 've been to a banya in a village several times . 
  i do n't know the temperature . 
  it was rather small , we visited it with a friend of mine , nude . 
  i do n't remember if there was a heater , probably not . 
  i do n't like hot humid air , i prefer a usual bath or a shower . 
  but at that village it was the only way to get yourself washed . 
  saint petersburg wins by a huge margin , in my opinion . 
  i have seen only few european cities , but i think prague is the best i 've seen so far . 
  no , it has to do with a car . 
  petrol pumps have a protection which should always unlock the pump when the tank is full . 
  however , with some cars , this protection works when the tank is not full because air can not exit fast enough at high flow of petrol . 
  i had such problems with my previous car , but never have them with my current one . 
  russian and english . 
  i can also decently understand spoken and written ukrainian . 
  as programming languages are also mentioned , i can add java , python , and c++ . 
  sure . 
  i 'm just too lazy to copy-paste characters with diacritics . 
  yes . 
  nn is the closest 1m + city to moscow . 
  we are even losing population due to this proximity . 
  i 've traveled to novosibirsk by train , for 40 hours . 
  what if we omit accented characters in czech and transliterate russian ? 
  i think so . 
  i have a feeling czech uses more sizzling consonants and less vowels . 
  `` przhishti zastavka something something '' , `` krtek '' . 
  as nn ( my city ) is very close to moscow ( 400 km ) , there is a single road , but it 's not really a highway . 
  in most parts , it has 4 lanes ( two lanes in each direction ) , without a proper median strip . 
  in some places , it has only two lanes ( one in each direction ) . 
  there are lots of traffic lights and intersections along the road . 
  it usually takes ~ 6 hours to cover these 400 km . 
  a road from my city to kazan , for example , is much worse . 
  it has only two lanes , so you always need to overtake slow trucks which might be rather dangerous at 90 + km/h . 
  i usually prefer to use train , it 's faster ( less than 4 hours ) and less expensive if you are alone . 
  planes are too expensive and inconvenient : airports in nn and moscow are not close to city centers , so getting to/from airports , registration , boarding , etc might cost you ~ 3 hours despite the actual flight taking only 40 min . 
  i use planes only when i have a transfer to a different flight in moscow . 
  highways outside moscow and st. petersburg areas can probably be counted on fingers . 
  in my oblast ' ( nizhny novgorod oblast ' ) , there 's a single 45-km-long piece of highway . 
  the conditions are great compared to most roads i encounter . 
  however , the one in my area suffers from rutting , and i 'm afraid of increasing my speed over 80 when it 's raining . 
  some highways in moscow and st.p are paid .

  but are they factual ? 
  yes . 
  so basically if you imagine yourself on the place of stalin ( let 's simplify it dramatically ) then you have a classical dilemma of choosing between two evils . 
  in this case between two great evils . 
  if you do n't do anything with collaborators you 're compromising your front lines , supply lines , personnel and so on . 
  and it 's a full blown war of annihilation so everything is on stake , just to remind you , but as ukrainian you should know that anyway . 
  or you 're killing many many thousands of people deporting them and solving that problem that way . 
  well , being stalin and making decisions on behalf of one side of the most brutal war in human history he decided it like that . 
  would you decide it differently on his place ? 
  maybe , but you 're not . 
  i just hope that i never will be on that place . 
  yup , it 's / r/europe , reddit 's official club of butthurted by russia :-), 
  what exactly the person who decided to remind me about tatar oppression in `` tsarist russia '' wanted then ? 
  what 's the point of that statement ? 
  and most importantly - what is has to do with me ? 
  i 'm what , representative ot `` tsarist russia '' ? 
  or do i need to fall on my knees and start crying , asking for forgiveness ? 
  so yea , russia is in the long line of countries who were around long enough to do something nasty in their history . 
  thanks for reminding but it 's irrelevant . 
  / facepalm, 
  ussr released 15 states when they wanted independence , you do n't have any problems with that i hope ? 
  but chechnya was different , it was very clear that their `` independence '' has nothing to do with the real independence , they have a criminal enclave there . 
  second - there was a genocide of russians there , if you 're not aware . 
  and third - chechnya was de-facto independent after the first war , but as it was never about independence for them , but about slave labour , maraudering , banditism and building an islamic state while they 're at it . 
  so after some [ painful realization ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budyonnovsk_hospital_hostage_crisis ) what that `` independence '' really means that de-facto independence was taken back . 
  give us a break , what exactly were you expecting us to do ? 
  you do n't mind that now checnya bathes in billions they have n't earned at all , stupidly luxurious palaces are built there , everything is renovated and so on ? 
  not to mention that it 's mostly for the same bandits who were killing russians 15 years ago and who are openly bragging about it , shooting people openly at the streets of moscow and provide a huge source for ethnic organized crime in russia . 
  that 's sadly the moscow way of buying peace in chechnya . 
  so how do you imagine russians look at chechnya now ? 
  we would gladly give you any independence you like , as long as we can elect a 15m steel solid wall with some electricity attached to it on the border first !, 
  i have n't murdered anyone , i just do n't care about your attempts to make me guilty of everything russia done in the past . 
  i 'm still hoping i 'm talking with reasonable people who understand that similar thing can be said for absolutely every country , at least if it exists for more than 200 years . 
  not everyone but most , yes . 
  my point was different , my point was that a lot of countries did various nasty things in the past , and i 'm not exactly sure for how long do we need to feel the guilt for that ? 
  let 's just define the time officially maybe ? 
  and i could 've used any other country , not us , but that native american genocide is one of the most famous . 
  btw , you 're not speaking with russia , unless you 're a looney . 
  you 're speaking with me . 
  jesus christ , i 'm really really sorry for ~ ~ native americans ~ ~ tatars !, 
  on behalf of the whole `` tsarist russia '' !, 
  oh i 'm sure collaboration with nazis is totally fine for him , he 's french after all !, 
  grats !, 
  man , can you get your facts straight for once ? 
  first of all deportation of tatars was not 50 years ago , but in 1944 , so 70 years ago , but that 's minor . 
  what 's not minor is that tatars were far from the majority , it was [ 20-25 % ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_crimea#crimea_in_the_soviet_union:_1922.e2.80.931991 ) . 
  and third - `` shipped in russians '' sentence boggles my mind . 
  noone was shipped from anywhere , your mental model of how soviet union was looking at that period is very far from the truth . 
  the russian population was living there for hundred of years already . 
  can you just educate yourself a little before writing that bullshit ? 
  and what it has to do with independence i wonder ? 
  the history just proves that that region does n't have much ties with ukraine , that 's it . 
  and it was assigned to the ukrainian ssr just for administrative reasons . 
  so what prevents them from declaring independence exactly ? 
  typical / r/europe for you - some dumbass expresses a simplistic but anti-russian opinion - upvoted . 
  russian corrected facts there - downvoted . 
  europe !, 
  i 'm sure the simpsons did it before him too . 
  but i 'm glad godwin 's law still works . 
   as you 're so big on minority rights , do n't you think that crimean tartars also have a say on whether they 'd like to go back under russian rule ? 
   sure , all 12 % of them . 
  and frankly , looking at how putin and kadyrov are the best buddies for life when he 's bathing in millions , i 'm sure putin can persuade crimean tatars without too much problem . 
  ( not that i 'm supporting it , i hope it 's obvious ) about the language - the majority in some regions simply do n't know the proper ukrainian ( \u0441\u0443\u0440\u0436\u0438\u043a - sure ) , because you know what - they 're not really ukrainians !, 
  that being said maybe they 'll introduce a new law solving that problem , i 'm totally fine with that . 
  but so far the only message crimea got is the message i outlined above . 
  and it 's reasonable . 
   we europeans know how to properly interact with russia much better than the americans . 
  [ yes indeed !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_barbarossa ) too bad you did n't quite had the luck last time , right ? 
   hopefully that will make the world safe and peaceful . 
  yup , that always was the intention !, 
  and it 's more than most . . 
  what do you know about russia apart from vodka ? 
  and how good do you think you know it on the scale from 1 to 10 ? 
  how dare you , everyone knows that only russians do propaganda !, 
  noble message ? 
  cheesus christ !, 
  ukrainian nationalists with 8814 on shields , portraits of bandera and shouting `` stab russian with a knife '' , sometimes even with ak in their hands from maidan - those have `` noble message '' apparently , right !, 
  but russians in crimea who want to stay russians in crimea and who are n't happy with throwing their democratic choice out of the window by some nazis - they do n't have `` noble message '' . 
  even more !, 
  they 're `` hardcore ultranationalists '' now !, 
  reddit ca n't produce something more fucked up than that , i 'm impressed . 
  people from crimea are hardcore ultranationalists ? 
  wow , that 's rich . 
  have you concluded it from the flag burning ? 
  no better way to turn russia to the western ways than some degenerate `` artists '' , right . 
  works so well !, 
  the government was about south-eastern ukraine , and they elected yanukovich ( democratically , i may add , confirmed by eu observers ) hoping for the better integration with russia and giving russian language an official status . 
  and janukovich never pushed in that direction too much btw , being a corrupt idiot as he is . 
  but it 's not as if he was the only one , remembering the glorious leader before janukovich which left the office with 1 % approval rating . 
  but as we all know it 's horrible if people democratically elect officials to represent their interests . 
  it 's not how it suppose to work !, 
  it suppose to work like this - violent coup supported by the other half of the country , throwing away anything south-east wants in the trash and the whole world cheers to the new democracy !, 
  yay !, 
  if it 's anti-russian then it must be democracy , as we all know !, 
  so what 's so unusual in people from crimea , which was gifted by ussr 60 years ago purely for administrative reasons and which never was ukrainian in the first place , use russians flags ? 
  because they 're fucking russians !, 
  and do n't really want to be in the country when their wishes are discarded so easily , when even if they do every democratic procedure correctly - some bunch of nationalists from the west can overthrow the government and immediately start fucking with status of their language . 
  what an isightful comment you have !, 
  not sure if i care about having discussions with you , as well as about legitimacy of calling nazi a nazi .

  moreover , if you want to punish somebody first prove it . 
  it won ` t end because nobody else has the numbers you need . 
  in reality you gon na get some portion of it for higher price , is it really in your interests ? 
  guilty of what exactly ? 
  new sanctions seem more like subsides to us energy sector . 
  the problem with automation is that it already happened . 
  number of jobs in production is halved in 50 years or so but unemployment remained stable in healthy economies . 
  new wave of automation will not change it . 
  in reality with the population decline trend like this you gon na have average pension like 25-30 % of average wage . 
  nah , it is for federal budget , in consolidated it is less than 30 % now . 
  ha , if russia was on the map , moscow would be third and sakhalin first . 
  which is sad really . 
  yeah but the [ crimes ] ( http://www.assembly.coe.int/committeedocs/2010/ajdoc462010prov.pdf ) were mostly commited against serb prisoners when nato forces were in kosovo and not yet prosecuted . 
  whataboutism is not childish imho , childish to think that there were good guys in this conflict . 
  i do not care about serbia or anybody in particular , i just don ` t like selective prosecution , which is exactly what happened . 
  nah in kosovo it was mostly against serbs and again under un/nato supervision ... 
  it is the old one , they talk about it from the very beginning . 
  these are different sanctions . 
  you do not understand japan did not support financial sanctions officially , they could lend these money and it was authorized by the government . 
  us did not like it . 
  crimea sanctions are light and not include [ credits ] ( http://asia.nikkei.com/politics-economy/economy/japan-to-launch-new-loan-scheme-for-russia ) . 
  they want the islands back , the are to be friendly . 
  us usually threatens with full compliance , there was a story recently with japanese bank to lend some insignificant amount of money to russian bank . 
  us intervened and threatened full compliance to japanese i.e. 
  the same sanctions . 
  so usually if us implements sanctions to other countries , others will have to follow maybe except russia and china . 
  russia loses 0.5-1 % gdp growth because of sanctions , iran will lose more . 
  it is not `` living fine '', 
  it is more about economy to slow down by higher carbon taxes and power costs i guess . 
  russia is rus ' in greek , it was fashionable to show connection to byzantia at the time . 
  actually the were number of kingdoms at the same time . 
  kiev was one of the centers of rus tribes . 
  my bad , there are indeed only bombs . 
  ok now it is even closer to the border , what difference does it make ? 
  [ yea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pgm-19_jupiter#deployment_sites ), 
  they are also not that easy to intercept so it is still a bargain . 
  they are mostly cruise missiles nowadays , not bombs . 
  the place is the same , they removed icbms and left planes with bombs and missiles . 
  why used to ? 
  they are still in place in germany , netherlands and turkey . 
  sorry i meant kosovo liberation army . 
  in slovenia probably . 
  in russia gdp per capita is the same as in 1990 . 
  10 % of population now is even worse than in 1990 , for 40 % it is more or less the same , some 40 % did improve their life and other 10 % now own everything . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35327494 http://www.assembly.coe.int/committeedocs/2010/ajdoc462010prov.pdf, 
  actually there was real [ genocide ] ( http://www.deltax.net/bissett/a-monster.htm ) of serbian population by kosovo security force , not like some risk . 
  nothing new under the moon , even russians . 
  eu is not a bad idea in general , implementation and empty expectations are a problem . 
  same as post ussr , they were promised to have living standards of us , in reality it did not play out so well . 
  when they say radar cross section of f-35 is 0.0001 m2 , it means front projection - when planes fly nose in front of nose . 
  if you conventional plane flies lower , higher or from the side of the stealth plane it will detect it beyond visual range ( from 60 to 120nm depending on radar ) . 
  it was used together with f-22 , it is not clear whether it capable or not . 
  it is useful from the front only , if you know enemy has these planes you can adapt your tactics . 
  as what you say is true , it is also quite possible that these people were used to engineer a coup . 
  there were two turning points when these protests could end but instead were fuelled first with police violence and than after yanukovich resignation , by blood . 
  from lexicological point of view it may be true , from grammatical point of view it is not . 
  russian evolved independently and later with strong french/general european influence , a lot of words common for ukrainian , serbo-croatian or polish are either archaic or spoken only in the deep country-side in russia . 
  i did not say it was west fault , i said they did nothing to avoid it . 
  and they could avoid it . 
   it 's like saying `` if you did n't wear an expensive watch , you would n't have been robbed , so it 's your fault for wearing that watch , '' rather than saying that the person who robbed the guy was at wrong . 
  more like you now for sure that the guy will be killed or beaten if he goes that path , but you still advise him to do so . 
  the point is if your gdp per capita is low , your goal is to have high gdp growth . 
  you can implement progressive taxation ( which lowers growth and make wealth distribution better ) later , when gdp per capita will be comparable with developed countries . 
  if you do it while still poor , you will never be rich in the first place . 
  i don ` t think it is feasible . 
  putin or not . 
  every guy will become putin like if he stays in power for too long in russia . 
  problem is not him personally . 
  yes and putin sais if you will not welcome them in nato there would no need to agression . 
  my point is why do everything to ignite this agression ? 
  without west supporting nato enlargement , these wars may never happened . 
  they can ` t now according to nato rules . 
  yeah it is not fair , but if you know the consequences why not avoid them ? 
  without west supporting nato enlargement , these wars may never happened . 
  it was a threat , the question is why encouraging them to nato if you know it will lead to a war ? 
  ok in ten , not in 5 . 
  it always a bit of both , in russia it comes from massive oil sector and liberal tax policy . 
  i said growth like in china , not gdp per capita like in china . 
  yeah but i would prefer growth like in china and this level of inequality , than growth like in czechia . 
  in 5 years even poorest will earn more than middle class in czechia . 
  that should be the goal , not to build another ussr with everybody equal . 
  no it is well known fact and i am dead serious . 
  income inequality in theory shall drive growth . 
  if your gdp growth is higher than let ` s say in czechia , who cares about inequalities ? 
  a [ graph ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_socialist_federal_republic_of_yugoslavia#/media/file:eastern_bloc_economies_gdp_1990.jpg ) for gdp per capita growth , it increased 3 times average over 40 years , the same growth as us had . 
  also bear in mind , that it is not ppp figures . 
  czech actually closer to austria than it was after ww2 and was more closer in 1990 . 
  poland indeed did not do well in 1970-s , it may have been better or much better or worse who knows ? 
  as for estonia/latvia i ` ve never seen historical gdp figures for these countries , if you can share it would be nice . 
  i guess estonia/latvia would not be better off economically because ussr gdp growth was generally higher than western europe until the 80-s . 
  which ones , exactly ? 
  west was not growing faster initially , it was one economy . 
  the point is east was poor from the begining , it grew faster but did not close the gap during soviet times . 
  because people have decided they will be better off without it . 
  it is a [ fact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_german_democratic_republic#comparison_with_the_west_german_economy ) not like i am making this up . 
  actually gdp growth of east germany was higher than of west germany . 
  ussr had average gdp growth 6-7 % after ww2 till late 70-s , than there was a slowdown in 80-s . that is higher than western europe on average within the same timeframe . 
  strangely enough gdp growth of east and west germany was practicaly the same 1945 - 1990 . 
  and yes it was lagging before ww2 .

  that 's what you pay guides for - to help you in avoiding dangerous situations . 
  for a lone foreigner without a basic knowledge of russian ? 
  absolutely yes . 
  having said that , moscow is by and large ok-ish but still , there are plenty of bad places . 
  i can relate to that feeling , if we exclude russia from equation . 
  as for what 's going on here ... 
  i would n't be so sure about safety . 
  that was meant to be a dark joke ; by no means moldova is some sort of syria or the likes .

  could we please just stop pretending that the west has ever given a flying one about the people living here ?

  obviously it was not the same . 
  just saying that a foreign support of secessionist / revolutionary movements is not unheard of in history . 
  quite the contrary . 
  the plummeting currency and burning reserves pose no threat to the dearest leader or the governing system that he managed to build . 
  they are massively cutting the social spending together with raising the indirect taxes to compensate the government for the shrinking oil revenue .

  local crime story, 
  hi , thank you for your contribution , but this submission has been removed because the information was recently posted .

  here is what random eu sitezen thinks about us invasions :  if memory serves it was america that invaded all those countries and other nato countries basically tagged along . 
  i kinda know that because i was there during the invasions in the past 15 years . 
  i personally would prefer america gives nato the finger . 
  it also means we can kick the american presence in europe out and we can give trump the finger when he sees the bill when he is forced to invade a country . 
  i speak english and totally fine with never visiting us nor uk . 
  `` dude '' had no appreciation for the russian culture . 
  he was just another soros and got his ass banned finally . 
  http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/27751/49/  is europe under us occupation ? 
  and do n't forget about moon . 
  * living standard if `` produce and consume '' is modern religion , then true . 
  i asked a guy once that he probably finds his job boring . 
  not at all , he said , i just think of god all the time and happy with that . 
  american msm is the last source you can trust when it comes to russia . 
  dude , you 're hardly a credible source . 
  just like your beloved bbc : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bbc_controversies, 
  ukraine itself does `` finance a criminal regime '' . 
  most money they pay for the `` eu 's gas '' go to that particular regime . 
  not only turkey but also usa . 
  they invaded syria . 
  the us should sanction themselves . 
  if they buy from eu , it 's eu 's gas . 
  anyway , most money still go to russia . 
  dude , trump loves usa . 
  he sold overpriced gas/carbon to several puppet eu states already and only `` against '' sanctions because congress will pass them anyway , so he is safe to say now : see , it was n't me . 
  only for ~ ~ idio ~ ~ americans . 
  as expected ? 
  american supervisors , $ 206 carbon , 1st place in corruption ... if that was your plan i salute you . 
  unless you 're gay [ gay prank in georgia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjferzhpxtg&amp;index=2205&amp;list=ll4efyzyt3qpvitvvn1ehtgw ),

  rip . 
  15-20 years ago i had a chat with an brazilian and mentioned brazilian carnival . 
  he said he hates it because `` there are only drugs and bitches '' . 
  perhaps they already knew ? 
  they did check your asshole in the past , ca n't say for now . 
  there could be different checks for officers and privates as well . 
  you can move as well , since you have nothing else to do . 
  no idea on how a lady gon na prove she 's a gay to a doctor though . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kuban  is a geographic region of southern russia surrounding the kuban river , on the black sea between the don steppe , the volga delta and the caucasus , and separated from the crimean peninsula to the west by the kerch strait . 
  krasnodar krai is often referred to as `` kuban '' , both officially and unofficially , although the term is not exclusive to the krai and accommodates the republics of adygea , karachay -- cherkessia , and parts of stavropol krai . 
  if true , what 's gon na happen after his retirement ? 
  i state facts , i do n't care how it looks to you or someone else . 
  yeah , if only they did n't forget gdp in process . 
  easily . 
  so in 41 it should be 168 +6 ( 7 ) = 174 ( 175 ) . 
  explain this : https://www.google.com/search?q=america+financed+nazi+germany, 
  you forgot [ stalin initiated the creation of your state ] ( http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-4737624,00.html ) this is how stalin killed his own people : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_soviet_union#population_2 1920 : 137,727,000 1926 : 148,656,000 1937 : 162,500,000 1939 : 168,524,000 1941 : 196,716,000 1946 : 170,548,000 ( -26 m , thanks to hitler and [ who financed nazi germany ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=who+financed+nazi+germany ) ) 1951 : 182,321,000,

  was fired by putin but magicaly returned back . 
  was `` sanctioned '' but magicaly allowed to visit munich conference . 
  made two ( ? ), 
  unsuccessful attempts to remove putin . 
  just recently russian central bank spent 55b on us federal reserve paper . 
  go tell fr about your great plan . 
  but i was told many russian teenagers support navalny ? 
  cause they are * less brainwashed * ... 
  pretty much now . 
  if you understand russian try to listen to this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xar_hjbhc and if you ca n't get what he is talking about , it 's okay . 
   and all people who watch tv hate ukrainians . 
  my dad even says he would gladly go kill them on donbas . 
  he would kill people of donbass ? 
  interesting .

  4m ukrainians work in russia . 
  what would happen if 4m russians arrived in ukraine ? 
  words like hohol or ukrnazi are n't related to any random ukrainian . 
  hell , all my friends in soviet army were ukrainians . 
  but for whatever reason all of them were from kyiv only . . 
  seems like that .

  they would build a military/naval base in novorossiysk . 
  dumbest thing i 've ever read . 
  russia would n't let to steal crimea from them ever , it has too much of strategic value . 
  never go full retard . 
  navalny was arrested for breaking the law , not for protesting . 
  rights to protest is in the russian constitution , which was written by americans in 90s btw . 
   whether that is his failure to diversify our economy from energy another person from the uk told me putin has fired the economy minister for refusing to diversify russia economy . 
  tell me what have you learned from the brits about [ russia football hooligans ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-38986206/the-secret-world-of-russia-football-hooligans ) ? 
  brits caused most damage to russia .

  ] ( http://image.glavred.info/images/608xx/dec2016/424774.jpg ), 
  except they see it different way than you do . 
  way more . 
  do not confuse putin with the govt . 
  you forgot most corrupt ... oh wait , your country is leader here . 
   he 's the best you guys have to offer great idea . 
  take him . 
  unless you want to stay \u2116 1 in corruption . 
   there is no such word as \u0437\u043b\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f in ukrainian let 's check this out .

  serbia is \u2116 14 . 
  and if the poll was conducted among russian redditors serbia would be \u2116 1 . 
  i said nobody tried and not some tried but got censored . 
  the point is how you discuss things and not what you discuss . 
  mods had enough of anti-russia bias there . 
  ghaleon was shadow banned in r/europe for some time . 
  i guess mods decided to unban him for a balance .

  many words are steadily migrating towards - a plural forms , you do n't say \u0434\u043e\u043c\u044b any more , for example . 
  hm , i ca n't think of many examples . 
  broken * spelling * is much more common . 
  people sometimes use the obviously wrong root for the verb `` to lay '' ( it has two roots that alternate , \u043a\u043b\u0430 in imperfective aspects and \u043b\u043e\u0436 in perfective ) . 
  what about `` the fact what everyone knows '' ? 
  maybe pskov itself is not the worst town , but the whole oblast is reportedly the poorest . 
  not that much . 
  and extraction tax is a federal tax . 
  pskov , dagestan and ivanovo are the poorest . 
  yes , same here . 
   considering their current demographics pechory has been a russian town since the 16th century , it became half-estonian after estonia sent settlers there after the post-treaty of tartu annexation . 
  you could 've written `` their historical demographics '' . 
  and finland and poland . 
  ryurik , who was invited to rule novgorod in 862 . 
   or just mental . 
  or just metal . 
  i do n't recommend eating pigments . 
  like colors red and yellow tasted together . 
  yes , the yellow one tasted like someone added canned orange juice ( not fresh cold pressed one , of course ) to it . 
  the orange one tasted like orange-flavoured candy or gum . 
  a chinese tourist wanted to take a picture of me and my wife in vladimir . 
  it used to be orange here , and unlike the yellow one in europe ( at least in germany ) that tasted of oranges it tasted of color orange . 
  they might 've made the switch to the more natural one , i have n't had it for a long time . 
  what country should he attack next , timurids or crimea ? 
  stopping past the stop line ( in front of the zebra crossing ) on intersections . 
  driving in the left lane on rural roads . 
  we could go to war to enforce the spelling of '' \u043d\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0435 '' and '' \u0431\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a '' . 
  vodka . 
  or shashlyk , if you do n't think vodka 's a food . 
  i grew up next to some overgrown anti-tank ditches that were literally the last ditch measure against the germans . 
  my dacha is relatively close to the former [ uvb-76 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uvb-76 ) source , but i have n't been there . 
  there was a fallout shelter next to my school , but a block of flats was built over it . 
  there are some military bunkers under moscow , one 's even been converted into a museum , but i have n't been to any of them . 
  centralised natural gas heating in the flat , electrocity in the dacha ( space heaters , will probably switch to a thermal pump aka an aircon next year ) . 
   guiris who 's that ? 
  putin speaks russian and german fluently , and also some english . 
  that 's lenin 's lamp !, 
  the most unusual potato crisp flavour that we have is `` boiled young potatoes with dill '' . 
  shashlik and crayfish flavours are nothing compared to that . 
  general population ? 
  i 'd guess germany . 
  vocational education is respected there and food is very cheap . 
  i do n't think anything can beat moscow in a fair fight , so i 'll pick a warm and picturesque place to retire to . 
  maybe some ethnically cleansed place in the caucasus . 
  altai is too continental and remote . 
  maybe crimea . 
  maybe the chalk hills of belgorod . 
  rich fat corrupt hypocrites . 
  most people do n't divide them and those that do divide them into the ones that are like catholics ( lutherans , anglicans ) and dangerous us state dept-sponsored cultists ( baptists , 7th day adventists , pentecostals , jws , mormons ) . 
  the latter are more numerous despite persecution . 
  russian-speaking intruding salesmen must be worse . 
  because that 's a pet peeve of yours , of course . 
  what about `` communists worse than nazis amirite '' ? 
  i 'd say this annoys most russians . 
  are there escalators in austria outside vienna ? 
   when salesmen approach you in the store ; and say '' \u0432\u044b \u0447\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0449\u0435\u0442\u0435 , \u0432\u0430\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0447\u044c ? '', 
  i can imagine this hanging in a rural bavarian 's toilet . 
  no , they start harrassing them about being late , missing deadlines etc. 
  this gives them a valid reason to fire you . 
  very common . 
  our forests are bigger than the rest of europe so it 's impossible to monitor them all . 
  yes-ah , it 's - ah very funny accent-ah . 
  you got me to google that , you can be proud of yourself . 
  turns out that was a charlotte hornets cap . 
  every second boy wore a chicago bulls cap when i was a kid . 
  i think it was because of jordan . 
  i had a green cap with a mutant fly , do n't remember the team name , though . 
  my ancestors were peasants , so i do n't have any concrete data . 
  i can give you a lower bound for some of them , since i know when these lands were settled by russians , but not for the ones from bryansk or vyatka regions . 
  what 's more important , it 's germany now and i speak german . 
  the smallest greater x in the world !, 
  we have bathroom-style lock knobs on our doors that can be opened with a coin from the outside . 
  in russian they are always more polite than positive questions despite having exactly the same meaning . 
  this causes problems when some russians mechanically translate their questions into english , where negative questions sound rude . 
  it 's okay as long as the property remains in use and is taxed upon inheritance . 
  so they skip junkfood to get junkfood ? 
  what kinds of porridge ? 
  in russia , porridges ( rice , oatmeal , semolina , millet ) are the best option . 
  a slice of cheese on white bread . 
  tea ( not very strong ) . 
  dammit . 
  fixed , thanks . 
  it was made popular by americans and most topping combinations were invented by americans . 
  also , pizzas i 've had in italy were n't all that great , even the ones baked in ~ ~ campagna ~ ~ campania . 
  tarusa is nice . 
  it 's small and neat , unspoiled by railroads and factories . 
  sky blue colour . 
  at least it was n't a double rainbow . 
  are you by any chance colorblind ? 
  the name checks out . 
  in russian : - \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 ( red ) - \u043e\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0436\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0439 ( orange ) - \u0436\u0451\u043b\u0442\u044b\u0439 ( yellow ) - \u0437\u0435\u043b\u0451\u043d\u044b\u0439 ( green ) - \u0433\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0439 ( azure ) - \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0439 ( blue ) - \u0444\u0438\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 ( violet ) all seven are common colours , azure is considered a color of its own and not a shade of blue . 
  speaking of money , one foster family here with 8 kids in their care boiled one alive ( they say by mistake ) and was so afraid of losing the rest and the money ( they parented full-time and had no other income ) they came up with an idea of kidnapping a boy that looked like the dead one . 
  what 's the number of the din standard for kitchen dimensions ? 
  i do n't think i can . 
  lack of contraception and sex education would be my best guess . 
  many of them are not really orphans with dead parents , quite a few are abandoned after birth . 
  the number has actually decreased significantly over the past ten years , despite everything you 've mentioned . 
  i have no idea how . 
  in 2014 we had almost half a million orphans , but only about 17 % of them were in state foster homes , the rest were in private foster care of various kinds . 
  only a few thousand get adopted ( as in , you are their parent from every legal point bar biological paternity/maternity ) every year , though .

  * one lgbt support group cited by human rights watch documented more than 300 homophobic attacks last year *  474 cases ** including insults ** in a whole year in a whole city . 
  you can see at least 10 % of that in the video alone . 
  * lets quote * * the maneo report shows that main offences in anti-gay acts of violence are insults ( 26 % ; 2011 : 30 % ) , actual and aggravated bodily harm ( 25 % ; 2011 : 21 % ) , and assaults and threats ( 26 % ; 2011 : 17 % ) * obviously insult is only 26 % while the rest are physical arms . 
  i stil dont know where you get that 10 % number assuming you understand russian or read the translation . 
   dude , really ? 
  are you really trying to prove that being gay is the same in russia i never did that , i asked an original question that nobody did answer yet , the polish guy and he tried to argue me down and the conversation did deflect without backing and making me eat nonsenses . 
   but you guys are definitely half a century behind on that matter and it is pretty fucked up and again more statements without facts or statistics see my reply 4 days ago , the last https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cwrbm/poll_shows_russian_attitudes_to_gay_people_are/ct08jpq?context=3, 
   offences . 
  not crimes . 
  very different . 
  i dont know so lets quote  in london alone , the metropolitan police recorded 1,073 ** violent homophobic offences ** http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/rise-in-homophobic-attacks-in-london-greater-manchester-south-wales-and-northern-ireland-say-police-9885511.html so they were violent  still have n't seen the source . 
  your source did not contain those numbers . 
  i already put the link just do ctrl+f `` more 300 '' http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30477728  making the numbers much more trustworthy ( as in `` not meaningless '' ) i tend to trust `` human rights numbers ''  i have seen 2 assaults in the moscow video alone . 
  wich still prove nothing and by the way one battery as for better sources for berlin http://www.maneo.de/en/news/detail/article/the-number-of-incidents-of-homophobic-violence-remains-high-homophobic-hate-violence-threatens-dem.html by the way none of you answered ** my orginal question ** and this conversation is seriously deflecting . 
  get over it one video can not show for 140 millions people . 
   i do n't see that figure in the link , ( seems awefully low , my guess would be under-reporting ) but ok ... well i mean is clearly written in the article and i quote  one lgbt support group cited by human rights watch documented more than 300 ** homophobic ** attacks last year *  ok , so not 1000 , but 300 . 
  let 's adjust to 360 for the whole year . 
  i took the datas from stotland yard the metropolitan police of london . . and i quote * scotland yard recorded 1,073 violent homophobic offences between january and october , up from 1,007 in 2013 and 1,002 in 2012 * see they are 300 ** assault ** in london but 1073 ** homophobic ** crimes while in st petersburg they are only 300 ** homophobic ** crimes . 
  you need to read better . 
  and fact check seriosuly your ratios . 
   nice fact checking , let 's do it again some time ... no problem , i am always good if you want we can do that again let see berlin * in berlin -- one of the most tolerant cities in the world , at least for gay men -- the percentages are higher . 
  out of 2,150 respondents , 43 percent reported hate crimes , up from 39 percent in 2006 * wich mean 1225 alone for berlin a city of 3 millions people . . 
   thanks for proving my point . 
  * attacks are so rare that when one happens it makes the news . 
  * ok so lets do some facts check i dont know according to the guardian they are around ** 1000 per year ** in london alone in 2014 http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/26/rise-violent-homophobic-crimes-reported-police while lgbt association record around 347 in st ptersbourg http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30477728 in both they are rising . 
  the numbers in uk are borderline schocking did you hear each of those attact in newspaper each day ? 
  i dont think so  also i talked about ** in the city center ** in * broad daylight * against ** random pair of homosexuals ** . 
  only two of my links were at night  the russian video ... not in the city center ? 
  well , sure * you do n't see the kremlin in the background * not really the soviet building clearly gave me a hint and i suggest to take a map of moscow . 
  beside i dont get it are you saying that working class people can not walk in those areas ? 
   besides : what about the second one ( which is much more violent/confrontational ) ? 
  sure it is still represent nothing at all and we dont know the background of the guy . 
  please again refrain to use anecdotes . 
  and you still didnt answer my question   with two of them outside the city center ( and one walking in the middle whatever on purpose ) outside the city center . 
  let see clearly the first one was defintiely outside the city center ( soviet style rise building appartement , air conditioneers in the backgroubd including the tiny corner store on the left  au contraire . 
  the fact that there * was * an attack tells * everything * . 
  ** no its not ** they walked amount a thousand of people 10 hours , it is ridiculous to claims it represent a country . 
   those guys could walk for a week around ( madrid , paris , amsterdam , brussels , berlin , vienna , rome , zurich , copenhagen , oslo , stockholm ) let see ** madrid : ** http://www.towleroad.com/2014/12/gay-couple-attacked-by-neo-nazi-gang-in-madrid/ ** paris : ** http://leplus.nouvelobs.com/contribution/1162129-nouvelle-agression-homophobe-a-paris-cette-violence-est-inacceptable.html ** amsterdam ** : http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/gay-man-beaten-loses-hearing-amsterdam-attack170614/ ** brussels : ** http://brusselstimes.com/belgium/3408/young-man-attacked-with-machete-in-marcinelle-for-being-gay ** vienna : ** http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/06/16/austria-gay-mep-attacked-with-acid-at-vienna-pride-parade/ ** rome : ** http://www.thelocal.it/20140627/rome-gay-centre-hit-by-faeces-attack ** copenhagen : ** http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/trans-woman-attacked-hammer-broad-daylight060613/ ** oslo : ** http://www.towleroad.com/2014/07/gay-man-attacked-with-glass-bottle-in-oslo-after-being-asked-if-he-is-gay/ ** stockolm : ** http://www.queerty.com/couple-attacked-one-stabbed-at-stocholm-europride-20080728 all debatable and anecdotes lets not forget this two gems below http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/26/rise-violent-homophobic-crimes-reported-police http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/muslim-mother-picking-up-children-from-school-has-hijab-pulled-off-and-attacked-by-assailants-10303354.html refrain to use anecdote please, 
   not even the same league . 
  and you still didnt my answer  this video shows two physical attacks in the middle of crowded streets in broad daylight . 
  with two of them outside the city center ( and one walking in the middle whatever on purpose ) outside the city center . 
  this videos is far from being representative both videos are worthless, 
  please i am curious defined `` civilized '' on wich criteria a nation is deemed to call `` civilized '' ? 
  you are right its up to 60 000 !, 
  and what kind of credibility the icps has ? 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_centre_for_prison_studies and you still have not answer my question . 
  no the law was passed it only affect 20 000 people not 200 000 !?? 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25433426 plus there is a chart you can see that the number of prissoners have been fallen since 5 years . 
   because it 's very likely the russian stats , like their old soviet counterparts , are a fabrication . 
  and it is very likely that you are lying without any single proof . 
  do you have any sources on that ? 
  after all this is coming from the icps . 
   you replied to that things are getting rapidly worse ( in terms of hum | an rights for gay people ) . 
  i was replying to his overall situation of the country getting worse ( not only in terms of gay rights ) wich is obviously false , the gay topic has been pretty static in russia since 2012 ( the date where putin pass his laws anyway in fact no new laws are being plan or were passed since 2013 . 
  the only thing i see is a rerun of the same show each year between muscovites and the governement wich obviously foreign media are blowing out of proportion each year [ furthermore i am waiting for the european court ruling on the case of * bayev and others v russia * ] ( https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/37475/en/european-court-of-human-rights:-%e2%80%98homosexual-propaganda%e2%80%99-bans-violate-freedom-of-expression ) so i dont know how he can claim things are getting worse since nothing did happen in 6 years or no laws are being planned right now for lgbt . 
  now one things stand in the `` open democracy '' article wich has directly a link with this current article and i quote  * the majority of russians probably have no opinion at all on gay matters , and only formulate one when prompted by the questions posed by vtsiom or the levada centre *  * the most glaring example was one run in 2005 by vtsiom ( a leading social and market research organisation owned by the state and managed by the government ) , where respondents had no opportunity to express a positive opinion about homosexuality . 
  people were asked the question : ` which of the following actions do you feel can never be justified ; which can be permitted in some cases , and which should be generally acceptable ? ' one example given for appraisal was ` homosexuality ' . 
  so respondents were allowed to choose between three negative options : ` should be banned ' ; ` okay sometimes ' and ` we can live with it ' -- not to mention the fact that homosexuality is described as an ` action ' * this is the exact same poll this dubious article is currently using as a reference to show a shift , how can he show it if the original poll 10 years ago was dubious or didnt ask for more positive opinion . 
   can you explain why you feel that way ? 
  i do n't understand how the video is relevant . 
  if he is truly russian he understand quite well the video and my point . 
  frankly i dont have time to write a wall of text on exactly this circlejerk . 
  i already gave some solid economic explanatation that mysteriously manage to get downvotes despites ** facts ** , people are not here to get fact but to listen walking idiot using hyperbole and sophistries . 
  https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cwrbm/poll_shows_russian_attitudes_to_gay_people_are/cszviyq?context=3 and here ** actually ** how to interpret russian polls instead of blaming putin ( the favorite sport ) https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/alexander-kondakov/do-russians-give-damn-about-homosexuality and additionnal infos . 
  definitely not i am quite serious . 
  big lol you belarussians are the best !, 
   yes , dream on mr. internet economist . 
  go tell the russian pensioners , that ruski econemy is going great : so you use ad hominem and a tiny bit of character assasination lets not forget an attempt to belittle me instead of debunking my points . 
  furthermore your link is from january and is link with inflation , ruble value ( all that i already adress in the two links i put ) furthermore get your shit update http://www.ipe.com/countries/cee/russian-pension-funds-set-for-more-secure-future/10007650.fullarticle http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mobile/business/article/russia-steps-back-from-brink-of-major-pensions-overhaul/519674.html you are not the brithest light in the room i guess huh huh huh , 
   it is not a joke . 
  yes it is  if russia keeps the current economic and foreign policy in place , chances are it will continue to stagnate and might never reclaim it 's place among the ( primary ) world powers . 
  oh boy ** crass economic ignorance ** in a nutshell , but i have already argue down people on that point https://np.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/3cp7yj/russia_is_top_us_national_security_threat_gen/csybdxl?context=3 https://np.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/3cp7yj/russia_is_top_us_national_security_threat_gen/csy9axs?context=3, 
   i seriously hope france is taking their orders from germany on this case . 
  that has to be probably , i strongly doubt at this point that the french can lead something right now inside the eu without germany approval . 
  this is no more the 90s and early 2000s where germany use to play the second fiddle . 
  [ yeah yeah right ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fopyrhhlt3m ), 
  lol big sorry did catch on !, 
  i am surprise you dont know that of course you should know that my dear estonian friend . 
  navalny was the hero of that sub !, 
   all in all not too surprising . 
  russia itself played a big part in the genocide . 
  it was the dutch that were watching all day long, 
  you would be surprise that veto was even backed by liberals in russia . 
  i edited yes and i wanted to talk to the guy in french . 
  yeah i saw the mod that was doing that from what i saw people were annoy with him . 
   while their budget is still in deficit , that deficit is also steadily declining since its highest point in 2010 , they were on path to reach a budget by 2010 before the crisis happened , and have recovered since then est ce que je dois te signaler que sa fait depuis 20 ans que l'italie n ' a pas eu un budget balanc\u00e9 ? 
   this french thing is getting hardcore . 
  what ? 
   there is n't an ideal job . 
  i just want earn enough money to pay bills the day they arrive and buy a nice house for me and my girlfriend . 
  yeah ... maybe not studiyng `` international relations '' would have seriously help ... 
   you mean that former polish-lithuanian territory that was annexed by russia circa 1790 ? 
  volhynia and eastern galicia was annexed by austria not russia, 
  maybe he was making a reference to the latin union https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_monetary_union, 
  ending the conversation by calling me `` a shill '' ( because my comments history certainly does not matter , ya know ... ) i certainly didnt expext that ( roll eyes ) let see what rationnal wiki has to say on that http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/shill_gambit [ of course it also show your weakness ] ( http://www.discussionist.com/101521053 ), 
   ah , you 're right , it 's again your english skills that prevented me from parsing your answer : yet you were wrong no matter the false excuses  so to reiterate : there is old guard , there is liberals and oligarchs club and there is putin and cooperative ozero  ( can we call it the billionaires club ? ) . 
  the billionaires club does not touch we cant call him a billionnaire club if not all them are . 
   the old guard but their liberal opponents are found dead or in prison over past decade . 
  yes you seems to understand  and all this you present as some kind of achievement of russian civilization in your attempt to troll random person on the internet . 
  yet , another nonsensical drivel  well played .

  what 's wrong with that statement ? 
  unless you believe that lukashenko 's socialistic `` paradise '' has been self-sustaining since the fall of the ussr . 
  the `` money in exchange for loyalty '' program clearly does n't work as intended . 
  let them go their own way to moldova 2.0 , for all i care . 
  no , i meant cut off bat ` ka and his cronies . 
  by the way , whining about `` moscow stealing our monies '' is a dead giveaway of a provincial person who has no clue about how the economy works . 
  one can hope that 's not yet another fake news . 
  it 's time to cut off the freeloaders who 've been sucking our money for more than 25 years now . 
   a senior new york city official briefed by the medical examiner 's office says russia 's ambassador to the united nations died last month from a heart attack and no foul play was suspected . 
  [ the latest : official says russian envoy died of heart attack | ap ] ( https://www.apnews.com/1320c69ced004e3694420242436fdb41/the-latest:-official-says-russian-envoy-died-of-heart-attack ), 
  220 years since the death of ekaterina ii , so yeah , it 's kinda correct . 
   sanctions would end oh boy . 
  the western sanctions are n't going to be removed in our lifetime , a regime 's change or not . 
  most russians would n't even notice that , since they tend to use homegrown alternatives , such as ok , vk and mail.ru instead of facebook/gmail . 
  also , it 's always fun to see how you enlightened and democratic europeans are gang-ho about authoritarian measures when it comes to the unwashed masses , but sanctioning any of the russian oligarchs who openly keep their money and families in the west is a big no no . 
  'cause they bring money to your economies , that 's why . 
  maybe we are not that different after all , with all these plebeian knee-jerk reactions to the powerful and wealthy . 
  well , my great-grandma lived through two world wars , two revolutions , czarism , war-time communism , stalin 's purges , khrushchev 's spring and the late socialism of the 1980s , all while residing in the same apartments . 
  and died at the age of 103 ( or rather at 105 , because she most likely forged her papers in 1918 so that she could be a bit `` younger '' , haha ) . 
  people put too much importance on politics . 
   200,000 rubles in 1995 the ruble was redenominated on 1 january 1998 , with 1 rub equaling 1,000 rur . 
  [ [ wiki ] ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/monetary_reform_in_russia,_1998 ) , so this sum of money could be just 200 rub in today 's rubles . 
  the current utility fees , food and medication prices are beyond comparison with that of the ussr . 
  it 's pointless to talk about how it would be . 
  realistically , most pensioners _ were _ better off in the ussr . 
  as of now , the average pension is barely enough to cover the basic needs . 
  that 's the reality . 
  simply put , a lot of people , especially retirees and state employees , would have been better off in the ussr . 
  now , they 're facing poverty with no relief in sight . 
  we have 42 millions of pensioners , and on top of that , roughly a half of the working population are being employed by the state . 
  do the math , 
  `` the others '' are likely creatures of your own sub-consciousness , however , there may be other opinions in that regard  i do n't insist on that , though . 
  i used to use the following technique : p1 , a preparation : you 'll need lay down and flex and then relax your limbs muscles ( without moving said limbs ) starting with your legs , going up from a heel to a buttock , then arms , going from a hand to a shoulder , then abdominals , chest muscles ( no idea how it 's called in english ) , finishing at your neck . 
  rinse and repeat until your body gets fully relaxed . 
  p2 , the hardest part : you 'll need to cross your eyes as if you tried to look at the bridge of your nose and then * roll your crossed eyes up into your forehead * , as if you tried to look at your `` third eyes '' from inside of your head . 
  by the way , it hurts , but you have to overcome this pain , keep your eyes crossed & rolled up and put all of your attention into the process . 
  very soon you 'll start seeing colour spots , flashes and other crap like that and eventually get into a self-inflicted trance state of mind . 
  do n't forget to breathe deeply , almost as deep as during holotropic breathwork . 
  p3 , enjoy the other world ^ tm , be as bad and perverted as possible , it 's , like , a necessary step . 
  once you explored your own perverted and violent nature ( that may take more than one night/session , obviously ) , you may want to explore the dream world and , perhaps , eventually meet the others . 
  having said that , do n't take these last words as an advice , 
  these things are not mutually exclusive . 
  that 's why there are still a lot of people who see him as he is - a brutal dictator . 
  nice backpedalling , man . 
  twisting facts to fit your agenda is always wrong . 
  as for stalin , he likely gets credit for not losing in ww2 . 
  i 'd wager that in 20 years from now he will be seen more positively . 
  rufed is a feminine country at its core , such a brutal guy with a moustache will never fall from grace here , haha . 
  on a more serious note , peter i , for example , was even more ruthless , yet we have a lot of monuments dedicated to him . 
   a total of 46 percent of russians expressed ** some kind of positive view of stalin in levada 's poll ** vs  ** worshipping ** stalin ok . 
  how the hell is usakov 's corrupt ass related to the topic ? 
   the parliamentary faction of the ruling national alliance will soon propose legislative amendments to have public and municipal officials suspended upon repeated violations of ** the rules concerning the use of the state language ** , the latvijas avize daily report on friday . 
  if he is corrupt , bring him to trial . 
  you 've just reinforced my point . 
  `` dangerous ethnicities '' , my ass . 
  except the implication that members of a certain ethnic group are more prone to be traitors to their host country just because of their ethnicity is , in fact , utterly racist , no matter how you spin it . 
  comes as no surprise that you westerners do n't hesitate to put your prejudice on public display . 
  structural bigotry towards the russians , which is deeply ingrained into the western mindset , has always been socially acceptable not to say openly encouraged in your culture . 
  i would n't hold my breath waiting for a `` good guy '' here . 
  such a guy is not coming . 
  i 'm not a big fan of cultural relativism either , but it 's stupid to expect the sudden appearance of a western-type centrist/leftist in russia . 
  the whole country is kinda right wing , jingoistic and violent . 
  navalny is a bit like that dutch dude , geert wilders , in sense that he wants to curb the uncontrolled muslim immigration , but otherwise he is as pro-western as you can get . 
  he is , though . 
  you should n't take wiki as gospel . 
  granted , somewhere in western europe he would be considered `` a far right nationalist '' , but for rufed , he is a very , _ very _ moderate guy , considering the alternatives . 
  and rightly so . 
  in response to numerous requests from the working people , this thread was marked as not safe for work . 
  hooray , comrades !, 
  no unmarked/unannounced gore videos here , please . 
  corrupt officials pose a direct and immediate threat to our country 's sovereignty . 
  here 's why : they keep their money in the west . 
  their families live in the west . 
  therefore , said west efficiently has them by the balls , which makes all of them potential or more likely actual agents of the foreign influence if not straight-out traitors to the russian people . 
  uncle joe would execute people for less , mind you . 
  could you please remind me , what was at stake , exactly ? 
  some corgis ' wellbeing ? 
  it 's baffling how good you guys are at defending of someone who openly spits in your face . 
  on the other hand , every nation deserves its rulers . 
  if i believed in all that spiritual crap , i would say `` karma is a bitch '' . 
  actually , i was there today . 
  and yeah , i 'm bitter about what i 've seen . 
  according to the organizers counter , ~ 15k people have shown up today for the march . 
  a lot of old farts , hipsters and intelligentcia ( or am i being redundant by mentioning this ? ), 
  the weather was surprisingly nice though . 
  looks ghetto as fuck . 
  and depressing . 
  the worst thing is that the neighborhood is not going to look any better for years to come . 
  you 're still forgetting about the time factor . 
  renovating such a huge amount of the housing stock in moscow will likely take decades . 
  in fact , it still works . 
  possible profits could be a tad lower but it 's not like that the construction business as a whole would become a charity , all of a sudden . 
  the neighborhood i live in now was fully made of 5-storey commie blocks as recently as 15 years ago , now it looks much , much better but the average apartment here is still nowhere near to be affordable for the vast majority of potential buyers . 
  itt : clueless westerners with a hard on for the god emperor , mwahaha . 
  the process of renovation has been going on for more than twenty years now and it has nothing to do with `` misusing public funds '' , whatever it is supposed to mean . 
  here 's how it is done : 1 . get a loan big enough to buy new apartments for 80 or so families 1 . move all the tenants to the newly bought apartments within the same district/okrug 2 . demolish an old 5-storey building and put a new 17-storey into its spot 3 . sell the newly built apartments for a gazillion of dollars 4 . pay back the loan , buy a yacht and a cool mansion in miami 5 . rinse and repeat , if you feel that your new mansion is not cool enough .

for putin , yeah , there are alternatives , but right now in syria , it seems , it 's either assad or bloody civil war between different extremist groups , while normal people flee . 
  i do n't . 
  i 'd rather they not do this , because they send people there in secrecy and if something will happen to those soldiers ... well , they were volunteers , who resigned from the army month before they got there . 
  i was writing more in sarcastic way .

  basically tipical russian military shit : they send some people somewhere without written order and later ( if they are caught , killed , or just found ) tell that they were volunteers or that they were never there . 
  even to mothers and wives of those soldiers . 
  like in afganistan , when soldiers came to one of the generals who sent them there and he told them that they can go fuck themselves , he did n't send them anywhere , that they volunteered .

  sometimes it 's about 30 minutes of walking between 2 . 
  it 's hard to explain , really . 
  i myself struggle with self-identification . 
  i feel that i 'm russian , not in terms of living in russia , but in terms of connecting to the past generations ( hell , even my surname is believed to originate in times of kievan rus around it 's christianisation ) , but i ca n't really describe what that means . 
  first of all , 100 years ago russia was mostly and agrarian country , urbanisation and industrialisation were very low and folk culture were concentrated mostly in villages and small towns . 
  when bolsheviks came to power , they were making a proletarian ( urban , industrial ) revolution in agrarian state . 
  they sacrifced peasants to support big cities like moscow and saint petersburg . 
  lots of people died during civil war , starved because of [ prodrazvyorstka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prodrazvyorstka ) and [ holodomor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor ) ( yes , it 's not about just ukraine , lot 's and lots of people suffered , but people here see russia as a continuation of ussr , so criticising it is seen as treason and people do n't care in general , but i 'll talk about it further down this post ) , and were killed in rebellions like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tambov_rebellion ) , let 's not forget the war against church and religion in general - a major part of russian identity . 
  later , during stalin 's rule there were further industrialisation and urbanisation , [ collectivisation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collectivization_in_the_soviet_union ) , [ great purge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_purge ) ( lot 's of people were murdered in this one , generals , party officials , even common people like tram drivers ) . 
  it all had a very strong impact on the population . 
  and there was a lot of communist propaganda . 
  `` old ways and traditions are bad , we need to destroy the old world to build a new one , we need to make a worldwide revolutuion , to erase nations and to create a new soviet man , who will be paragon of all vitues '' . 
  so it was a genocide , cultural and physical . 
  and aside frome couple of people , nobody really cares , really . 
  then the great war came . 
  about 3.5 millions surrendered in the beginning of the war due to surprise attacks ( those who survived mostly went straight to gulags after the war as traitors and untrustworthy elements ) and the war itself was a real bloodbath . 
  nazis wanted us dead and sovit command was pretty incompetent so it just threw wave after wave at the enemy as if they also wanted to kill us all . 
  even if you look at [ wikipedia data ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_casualties#ussr ) you can see that 24 millions were killed ( we still find unrecognised remains in former battle fields ) almost 14 were from russia , 7 were from ukraine . 
  and while there are many ethnical groups within russia , most of those who were fighting were ethnically and culturally russian . 
  if you really want to see how the war looked through the eyes of a simple russian soldier you can read some of [ astafyev 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viktor_astafyev ) work , the only problem - i do n't know anything about translations . 
  he went throught hell and he thought that all those generals with their medals , all those party leaders should stand on their knees and pray for forgivness for what the 've done and how . 
  after the war collectivisation and urbanisation plans were continued . 
  people started to flee countryside , because there were no perspectives there . 
  the city life become a desired one . 
  lots of people were left without their fathers and grandfathers . 
  propaganda was going strong . 
  traditional russian culture started to resurface a bit in the 70 's . 
  but it was seen as a marvelous artifact from the past , as something dead , as tourist attraction . 
  not as something that can be influential right now , be part of modern culture . 
  not that all people thought that way , but they were silenced . 
  just look at solzhenitsyn for example . 
  so now we have people who 's link to the past generations was strongly distorted . 
  we do n't even have our own little home in federation . 
  other ethnic and cultural groups have their republics within federation ( tatarstan , yakutia , buryatia , chechnya , dagestan , etc ) , but we do n't have russia ( i know it 's hard to follow , but what you call russian i actually two different things : russkiy - the russian as in nationality , and rossiyanin - citizen of russian federation ) . 
  if , for example , the next president will be from yakutia , he will be considered russian even if he is yakut , because he speaks russian , he lives in russia , he read the same books in school . 
  so we are even more dissolved . 
  in many countries people have some sort of modern version of national dress , like in japan , scandinavian countries , even in national republics within russian federation . 
  almost none of it here . 
  i talked with lots of people . 
  near me and far away via internet . 
  most see traditional russian costumes the same way as they se japanese ones . 
  as somethin that foreign to them , though they understand tha that is part of their past . 
  same with folk music , for example , it 's almost forgotten . 
  only couple of songs are in use and it 's more due to the fact that they were chosen buy some modern singers .

   very good , why should it be ? 
  have n't you ever heard of the [ european charter for regional or minority languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_charter_for_regional_or_minority_languages ) ? 
   plus , no wonder it became extremely popular after the russian invasion . 
  [ it was always popular ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014#polling ) . 
   closed their assembly mejlis was banned for a good reason , extremist organizations are not welcome in russia . 
  most of non-albanians were expulsed from kosovo after it became independent . 
  it is pretty clear that idea of nato intervention was not to stop ethnic cleansings but to punish serbia . 
  soon after the revolution ukrainian parliament voted to cancel the law on state language policy which meant that russian wo n't be regional language in crimea anymore . 
  people of crimea were not very happy about it , they realized that soon they will be in position of russians in estonia - people of 2nd sort . 
  no wonder that idea to join russia became extremely popular . 
  as for the crimean tatars , their situation at least did n't got worse : their language was not officially recognized , not it is . 
  even if you think that this is just a formality , in ukraine they were not allowed to have it . 
  albanians in kosovo also had albania next to them , but it turned out that it was fine to declare independence of kosovo instead of moving to albania . 
  the same here . 
  israel also sells to azerbaijan . 
  i would like to add that russia sells weapons to azerbaijan because otherwise they will buy from someone else . 
  armenia gets weapons for free to maintain status quo . 
  and this is my personal attitude to this conflict : i think that nagorno karabakh should be armenian because armenians are and were majority there , plus armenia won the war . 
  the problem is that armenia and karabakh do n't have common border , [ see map ] ( http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/files/2016/04/nkarabakh-map.jpg ) . 
  actually small part of karabakh is controlled by azerbaijan and not shown at this map . 
  armenia currently occupies not only karabakh but also significant part of azerbaijan . 
  i believe armenia should keep lachin corridor and karabakh and return other occupied areas . 
  azerbaijan should keep his part of karabakh as a compensation for lachin corridor . 
  the most native population in crimea are crimean greeks . 
  some of them still live there . 
  but some parts of crimea belonged to kievan rus long before tatars appeared there , see [ tmutarakan principality ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a2%d0%bc%d1%83%d1%82%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%bd%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b5_%d0%ba%d0%bd%d1%8f%d0%b6%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%be ) - there 's no english version , unfortunately . 
  it was choice of crimean people to reunite with russia . 
  after the referendum parliament of crimea declared independence and requested the russian government to admit it into russia . 
  russia did n't annex it , it just let crimea in . 
  a thousand years ago [ russians already lived ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/50cy29/map_of_europe_in_1000ad_1640_x_1244/ ) in current eastern estonia . 
  yuryev ( current tartu ) was founded by the russian yaroslav i the wise . 
  crimean tatars settled in crimea less than 600 years ago . 
  and now they are indigenous people in crimea , but russians are occupants in crimea . 
  good example of double standards . 
  funny to hear it from someone from a country where national minorities are treated as `` occupants '' . 
   it 's just a step closer to destroying yet another culture . 
  it is a step to protect crimean tatars ' culture . 
  one example : republic of crimea has 3 official languages now , crimean tatar is one of them . 
  it was n't official when crimea was ukrainian . 
  it does n't make any sense because according to ukrainian law all ukraine must take part in referendum , not only crimea . 
  it is obvious that even all people of crimea will vote to leave , the final result will be `` remain '' . 
  it was a gift to brothers when 300 years of reunification russia and ukraine was celebrated . 
  republics in ussr had no real power , everything was dictated from moscow . 
  those gpd rises and falls are caused mostly by oil price , sanctions are much less important . 
  this video is about a man who criticized kadyrov , not putin . 
  let 's compare amounts produced in decade : 907,3 mln tons was produced in 1982-1991 , 893,6 mln tons was produced in 2006-2015 . 
  116.7 million tons of grain was produced in russia in 1990 [ proof ] ( http://www.gks.ru/bgd/regl/b11_38/isswww.exe/stg/04-07.htm ) . 
  104.8 million tons of grain was produced in russia in 2015 according to your `` fact checking '' link . 
  116.7 is more than 104.8 , it makes me think that i was correct when i sad that grain production in russia decreased , not increased . 
  also it makes clear that the one spreading lie here is you . 
  i meant [ grain ] ( http://history-russia.livejournal.com/160831.html ), 
  do you mean transnistria and gagauzia ? 
  i do n't think that gagauzia is breakaway . 
  it is not an achievement at all , it is a degradation actually . 
  russia 25 years ago ( not ussr ! ), 
  produced more grain than russia now . 
  it had to import because there was a lot of cattle , and cattle consumes a lot of grain . 
  now russia imports more meat , but exports grain . 
  [ edit reason : replaced `` wheat '' by `` grain '' ] . 
  you are correct , but it happened in 20th century . 
  i think he was n't talking about himself personally . 
  is is sarcasm ? 
  i ca n't believe that you do think that the last 25 years was a great time for ukraine . 
  i do n't think that serbia will join eu before kosovo . 
  i expect that croatia will block it . 
  it does n't matter if kosovo distances from albania or not . 
  if we recognize it as an independent country , then we automatically recognize it 's right to host any troops , join any alliance or even unite with any other country . 
  albanians in kosovo also had albania . 
  does it mean that they had no right to tear up serbia 's land ? 
  belarus suffered even heavier than poland . 
  it lost 25 % of the population . 
  why do you think that you were at the level of ghana ?

  * god works in mysterious ways *, 
  only russia . 
  do you know how the problem in this video was `` fixed '' in russia in 90s ? 
  market prices were set and you could buy anything you wanted without any queues . 
  but the problem was that too many people could not afford it . 
  for example , it resulted in huge drop of meat consumption per capita . 
  if you compare modern russia with russia in 1991 , you will see that economy is approximately the same as it was 25 years ago . 
  we have the same volumes of housing built every year , the same number of air passengers , etc. 
  there was no progress during last 25 years . 
  the distance between russia and developed world is only growing , although we had ten years of incredibly high oil prices . 
  that explains why many russians have fond memories of the ussr , not because they are `` dumbasses '' as you said . 
  no wonder . 
  the ussr was [ the 26th by hdi in 1990 ] ( http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/reports/219/hdr_1990_en_complete_nostats.pdf ) ( page 121 ) , in 2015 [ former ussr would be only 71st ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/3s5mix/if_ussr_was_reunited_in_2015_oc_1500x844/ ) .

  it is n't public holiday in moldova and macedonia . 
  correct , they wanted the same status as russia or ukraine , but did n't get it . 
  we both know that it would never happen . 
  ukraine would never let crimea go even if russia would pay entire ukraine 's external debt . 
  you are absolutely correct !, 
  they voted to become a ** separate ** republic , but became only ** autonomous ** republic .

  ) , who was assassinated recently , [ locals ] ( http://imgur.com/a/czd6e ) seems to be very thankful - they do care . 
  yeah , if you run out of arguments , play a ` russian card ' , 
  that 's correct - most of the post-communist countries expirienced economy problems in early 90s ( [ data ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:aze:blr:hun:lva:pol:rus:ukr:est&amp;ifdim=region&amp;ind=false ) ) . 
  main reason for this is n't only social transformation , but the unpreparedness to compete with western goods because of their superior quality . 
  edit : worth to add , that ` poor 90s ' lead to a huge birth rate decrease , which soon will affect economy of post-communist [ countries ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_cbrt_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:blr:hun:lva:pol:rus:ukr:est&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=498430800000&amp;tend=1413579600000&amp;ind=false ),

   what i 've seen for the past 3 years coming out of kremlin and your state media , i 'd call that westernophobia ... see we can play that phobia card as well , your gov ' t and state media are spewing hatred against ` us ' westerners more times than i care to count . 
  that 's true , literally every government is palying this card . 
  naked monkeys tends to unite in a face of danger coming from neighbor tribe . 
  it 's f * cking biology and himmler was an amateur in operating these features . 
  however , there is a point i 'm repeatetly making over here - russian propaganda is clumsy and less represented , so it 's easier for us to ` wake up ' . 
  i do n't want to offend people like it seems , i deliberatly use rude words for extended emotional feedback . 
   your government please kindly accept the idea , that from opposite side it 's looks different . 
  for that reason it 's very important to increase diversity in information sources - both media and people . 
  my government or i should say putin 's inner circle indeed benefits from war/fear mongering , but so does western countries and especially military industrial complex . 
  there are numerous international competitions among students where eastern europeans and russians are doing great .

  yes , exactlly my point : primitive one liners can get upvoted if they fits simple condition - criticize russia/russians . 
  according to your comment history , you spend like 99 % of your time on reddit in russia related posts . 
  it 's ok , but you definetly knew details about those bloger and why this artcile tagged as `` misleading '' . 
  you are not revealing real information to community , but keep mocking russians . 
  why ? 
  - because you get dopamine release each time you get upvoted , and that 's creating rewarding stimulus for your brain ( same for vast majority of people here ) . 
  you may think it 's not too bad , after all you feels good so it must be something good happening . 
  but actually opposite is happening - you are crippling your brain with easy stimulus , just like drug addict or procrastinator . 
  we both aware of communism crimes ( well , i do n't agree with obvious exaggerations ) and we both know about the suffer people 've received from this ideology . 
  however , it seems that you do n't realise that there was something good in \u0441ommunism - it did not allow a person to become an idiot ( / wave eastern european it-guys ), 
  i 've registered on reddit like 4 month ago and it 's 4th ` russia denies invasion of poland ' here in my memory ( and second jerk over that blogger ) . 
  big surprise fellows did n't manage to pass through ` it 's not in their history books - nope , here is their history books ' in 7 hours . 
  what is pernament though is that simple russophobic comments receives highest marks . 
  community simply does n't seeking for historical context or at least details about mentioned bloger - ` russia is bad ' is enough to keep it going . 
  edit : the main point is that subreddit lacks of self-regulation - click-bait article with poor journalism attracts people simply for ` russia is bad ' narrative . 
  the reason for this is high percent of people with low cognitive capabilities who are affected by bandwagon and confirmation biass diseases . 
  just imagine how it 's hillarious when one of the most upvoted posts on a subreddit are fake photo by ukraininan militaries and an attempt to accuse russian for journalist 's suicide in ukraine . 
  ** o ** peration ** i ** raq ** l ** iberation took place between 2003-2011 , so it 's quite modern war with lots of high-end military gear ( and very-very democratic ) were used . 
  so in my opinion it 's remarkable , that western informational field injected with `` russia bombs civilians '' meme , while even pro-rebel sources like sohr provides data with noticeably low percent of civilian casualties . 
  also , note another meme `` russia bombs moderate rebels not isis '' - according to sohr ( who would lower numbers obviously ) ruaf killed up to 2758 members of the `` islamic state '' organization and 2851 fighters from the rebel and islamic factions . 
  that 's close numbers , is n't ? 
  so , once again , be aware of information you receive from your media - it seems it would be good for you . 
  worth to add that according to sohr out of 3915 civilian casualties 2398 are [ males above 18 years ] ( http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=51898 ) old , so do the math folks . 
  in overall , i bellieve that syrian civil war is a nice example why westeners should be aware of their mass media : it comes from a mildly controversial statement that refugee crisis caused by russian intervention , as well as rfom bitching about civilian casualties as soon as rebels come closer to total failure . 
  you do realise that you 've switched topic and originaly we are discussing economy issues in russia ? 
  it quite obvious , that we both could have separate views on the conflict , and for that reason our dispute wo n't change our opinions and wo n't add valuable information about the topic . 
  to be fair , it 's quite important to note that a lot of private russian firms are dodging taxes by paying employee without accounting it in official papers . 
  * one my friend * had official salary four times lower than actual ( = however , it 's not the case for majority of people, 
  ` war on ukraine ' thing is damaging only because of lose of market , which happened to both sides . 
  needless to say , that it 's not only no russian initiative , but we also warned ukrainian side about unavoidable damaging consiquences of opened market for eu goods . 
  respectable acra rating agency reported , that whole situation will cause quite long , but not that much deep recession in a real income . 
  important to note , that recession will look like downgrade in good 's quality , but not as deficit or lack of goods or services . 
  edit : acra articles/researches : - [ russia : economic outlook 2020 update ] ( http://acra-ratings.com/research/88 ) - [ consumption : absence of growth to be offset by quality change ] ( http://acra-ratings.com/research/28 ), 
  voting results in rostov 's election station # 1958 are [ cancelled ] ( https://lenta.ru/news/2016/09/19/rostov/ ), 
  btw , is it widely spread in other countries to show online cameras at the election stations ? 
  thank you , dummy , that 's exactly my point : no matter what - blame russian federation, 
  it 's beyond laughable that western media and organisations does n't discuss revealed leak in a position of fair sport and required reformation in anti-doping authorities , but rather prefer to blame russia for hacker attack of unknown origin . 
  control over energy transit and prevention of eu-rus cooperation . 
  of course i 'll be labeled as putin bot and will trigger rage ... but i definetly advice to read his valdai and last un speeches . 
  inb4 ` it 's important what he does , not what he says ! ', 
  - it 's even more important what informational space you belongs to . 
  o / to be fair , russian oil not so easy to extract , to process and to transport . 
  oil industry have been profitable for so many years , so i believe a lot of top engineering skills/technologies are involved here . 
    russia targets the non-isis rebels , because those are closer to assad , and thus the bigger threat to assad . 
  russia was first to target isis oil business . 
  for some reason , usaf were allowing isis to run huge convoys over the desert , as well as to maintain financial operations with stolen oil . 
  of course , russian priority was nusra because of their proximity to big syrian cities , but it does n't mean that isis [ was untouched ] ( https://futuristrendcast.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/palmyra-russian-orchestra-concert.jpg ) . 
   there 's been a grand total of 161 russian airstrikes on isis since the day russia entered the conflict . 
   in contrast , us ' coalition has conducted 14,800 on isis source ? 
  according to anti-assad sohr , numbers are [ following ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casualties_of_the_syrian_civil_war#foreign_air-strike_casualties ) . 
  so usaf kills about 0,4 jihadist per airstrike ? 
  definetly syria requires more weddings  how comes , that isis has started to lose territory only after russian intervention ? 
   as if it 's not propaganda meant to persuade people with weak cognitive abilities . 
  yeah , look at the numbers you 've provided ( =, 
  i realise that russian airstrikes causes deaths among civilians , but one of the undisputable fact is following : isis had been growing two years under usa lead coalition bombing , and then , year after russian intervention isis becomes waswas . 
  btw , i do n't trust american founded ngo 's - they are spreading lies among people with weak cognitive abilities  baghdad hospital in hreitan was directly targeted on 25 december 2015 and severely damaged . 
  a doctor and another medical worker at the hospital told amnesty international that a ** russian or syrian ** warplane fired ** missiles ** directly at the hospital . 
  russian ministry of defence denies deliberate civilian killings , as well as [ unconfirmed information ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vehv6j0gfho ) related to civilian infrastructure bombing, 
  according to the ukrainian site , which links to russian opposition source , where luzhin is speculating , that whole thing is about this paragraph . 
  actually , it 's lawyer and luzhin who are refering specifically to this fact , because it 's one of the few correct statements in those so-called ` facts about bandera ' . 
  whole situation is beyond comedy : soviet invasion is covered in russian school books ; everybody can google translate luzhin 's statements ; article posted in biased site - still people throwing shit on russia . 
  good thing noone commited suicide . 
  there are full bingo of westener 's delusions about ukraine : - yanukovich was pro-yanukovich , he was trying to balance between west and east . 
  most pro-russian moves by him are : allow russia to ** rent ** sevastopol naval base and official status for russian language in eastern ukraine . 
  - yanukovich was indeed legally elected , because country get tired of pro-west folks . 
  i hope it 's ok that i prefer [ real polls ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/187931/ukrainians-disillusioned-leadership.aspx ) instead of your opinion . 
  - they had a right to remove him by legitimate way , i.e. 
  by election or by impeachment procedure . 
  strange , but western media does n't report , that impeachment was n't successful : only 328 lawmakers did vote for impeachment , while 338 is required . . and constitutional court was disbanded right after the vote . 
  not to mention , that parliament was occupied by people with guns ... so there could be speculations about free will of 328 lawmakers .

seeing so many people eating apples , polish doctors probably are saying to themselves , `` fffuuu ... '' as a side note , it is n't the first time russian government bans import for political reasons . 
  mineral water and wine from georgia was banned for the whole presidency of saakashvili . 
  thanks !, 
  never seen those . 
  they 've ran out of ideas , have you heard their anti-eu nonsense ? 
  it 's funny it was important for many soviet people as almost the only foreign festival translated on tv . 
  its participants were jokingly called `` sanremontniki '' by some , which means `` plumbers '' in russian . 
  shows with such a long history feel like someone greeting you back from the 60 's . 
  that 's all this show is about ? ... how many people watch it ? 
  yeah , on the other hand , if the show is so popular that it as lasted for long , then they could be rich . 
  with additional income from ads and such , it may add up to a considerable sum of money . 
  when i see the word `` klan '' it reminds of ku klux klan . 
  [ its logo ] ( http://imgur.com/0ymaubi ) would look great on a pack of some quality sour cream or cheese . 
  it 's a pity it is , as you say , such an over-dramatic show . 
  i 'm not very familiar with german tv ( i only remember seeing pimp my fahrrad and die toten hosen on mtv when on vacation in croatia ) , although a person i knew once told me that her relatives in germany disliked the tv a lot . 
  actually , there are many shows like that , and i really hate being subjected to some awful scandals and such . 
  these shows feel disconnected from reality , like some emotionally unstable kid playing barbie . 
  the questions were funny . 
  in the category `` furniture '' , the answer could be `` toilet '' , some answers were misspelled . 
  and there was a category `` cool guy '' , the answer to which was `` bashurov '' -- the game 's developer . 
  i do n't know about poland , but i do n't think tv series actors get that much money . 
  it depends on the show , but still considerably less than movie actors . 
  maybe they owe the director a lot of money so they have no right to quit . 
  everybody loves smart quiz show hosts . 
  all hail jordi, 
  cringeworthy and completely unfunny jokes ? 
  we do have it in russia . 
  evgeniy petrosyan has been a comic for around 50 years . 
  an epitome of redneck humour . 
  along with dom 2 , a godawful show where people try to find a partner , he 's one of the figures which even politicians sometimes speak unfavourably of . 
  sorry to hear about your loss . 
  better than crack, 
   meet chris hansen i doubt he is a pedophile . 
  at least , i ca n't find any info about it . 
  there 's never been any scandal , at least . 
  by the way , did you know there was an [ unofficial pole chudes game ] ( http://imgur.com/zihzshm ) ? 
  you made my day, 
  in russia , there are jokes about mongolia similar to the ones about albanian technology . 
  mutation from malnourish, 
  this reminds me of that old image macro : [ imgur ] ( http://i.imgur.com/phpwnm0.jpg ), 
  reminds me of this anecdote : two russian drunks are crawling on the railway . 
  the first one says : `` what the hell is wrong with these stairs ? 
  the steps are so flat '' . 
  the second one goes : `` and the handrails are so uncomfortable '' . 
  the last one exclaims : `` hold on , guys !, 
  i see the elevator is coming !, 
   * `` used to '' * well , our government has revived this practice . 
  our politicians may have offshore bank accounts and villas all over the world , but still they insist that it 's united states department of state which is the root of all evil for russia . 
  next thing i expect from the government propaganda is the return of kuzka 's mother . 
  in the context of the post you 're referring to , i was joking , of course . 
  [ but the matter stopped being funny some time ago ( a picture from some russian article on ukraine ) . 
  the political and social oppression in which they lived would n't leave anyone a choice . 
  i 'm happy for them because they escaped the country which treated them like this . 
  it 's sad that one of the most famous russians with jewish roots , mikhail khodorkovsky , was sent to jail and had his company taken by the state , and yet i know many people who think `` he 's a jew , that 's what he deserves '' . 
  by coincidence , his nickname `` hodor '' has gained a new meaning with the success of the game of thrones . 
   so imagine the circle jerk when portugal lost 4-0 to germany i think there 's never been a higher concentration of schadenfreude in a country in the history of the universe . 
  i should remind you that in 862 , russians got tired of trying to establish order on their land , said `` screw it '' and invited vikings to rule them . 
  rurik , the first ruler of what would become kievan rus , established a dynasty which would last for more than 700 years . 
  sometimes i think we should do it more often . 
  reminds me of this quote : `` in ussr , the states were perceived as some kind of heaven ... everything was better there . 
  it was very hard to get there , and if you made it , you never came back '' . 
  distantly related : soviet cosmonauts are called to the meeting . 
  their supervisor is telling them : `` you 're going to fly to the sun '' . 
  they reply : `` but we 'll die ! '' . 
  the supervisor is enraged : `` do you think only idiots work at politburo ?!, 
  you wo n't die , you 'll fly in the night '' . 
  danes are beautiful , smart , nice and reasonable people too . 
  * and * you created lego . 
  one new russian brags to another : `` i have so much money that i could buy the whole moscow ! '', 
  the other answers , `` buy ? 
  i 'm not selling it '' . 
  large factory in soviet union , 50s . 
  all workers are called for an announcement . 
  the manager takes the stand and says , `` tomorrow , you must come at 8:00 am for your death penalty . 
  you will be hanged . 
  questions ? '' . 
  the silence ensues . 
  one man rises hand . 
  `` yes ! '', 
  -- says the manager . 
  `` comrade manager , will we have to soap the rope ? '', 
  capitalists, 
  it 's exciting how 2 nations which are considered to be beautiful , smart , nice and reasonable people , have jokes about each other . 
  well , i 'm not surprised, 
  just out of interest , what 's the stereotype about russians ? 
  international classic . 
  never gets old . 
  we have the same joke about wily russians who take everything which is n't nailed to the floor . 
  there are many russian anecdotes about jews which are pretty rude . 
  it 's really sad because the attitude to them during soviet years and before was racist ( it 's sad one of the few words that were borrowed from russian to english is ` pogrom ' ) . 
  it 's interesting that there are n't many jews in russia today , and yet the hate towards them still is pretty evident because of the ultra-conservative mentality prevalent in the country . 
  i 'm generally confused when i hear russian jokes about jews because i 've barely seen them and the ones i saw certainly did n't live up to their public image . 
  and not to forget that a lot of soviet scientists and public figures were jewish , heck , even one of ussr 's most famous singers had jewish roots . 
  foreign jokes at least are more relevant , like that one . 
  i laughed out loud . 
  i did n't know swedish jokes were co cool . 
  can you post some more ? 
  yeah , this is a good idea . 
  and the stereotype is really funny itself , estonians are definitely not slow-witted . 
  it 's better to expose a crime than to keep pretending everything 's alright .

   this is never brought up because it does no fit in with the narrative of targeted starvation idk about kazakhstan . 
  their regime is actually pretty anti-soviet . 
  as for russia not bringing up the famine on kuban and don , well , this just tells something about our mass conscience , and it is n't reassuring . 
  i 've heard that the soviets had a hand in defining genocide back in the 40s just to ensure that their own crimes do n't qualify even if/when they become known to the world . 
  have you read * bloodlands * ? 
  according to snyder , the holodomor was all this ( bad economic policies , bad social policies ) , but it has also been carried out as reprisals against the subjects who were not complying with stalin 's policies of internal ( or , in the case of kazakhstan , not-so-internal ) colonization . 
  if old winnie and his gang have seen the bengali farmers as potential collaborators that must be preventively punished , then you can put an equation between the holodomor ( and the famine on the don and in kazakhstan ) and the famine in bengal . 
  uh-huh , i 've forgot the exact name . 
  the golden rule of journalism : if the headline is a question , the answer is ` no ' ,

  i do n't get why companies should n't sue governments . 
  do you like it as we have got it in russia here ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  look at slovakia - it 's still shown as a separate state , not reintegrated into the czechoslovak republic , but the podkarpatian rus is soviet , as irl - and its incorporation was a last moment soviet decision not discussed with the allies . 
  also , bialystok is shown on the soviet side of the border , as it has been in 1939-1945 . 
  there 's no way in hell one can pin it down to any stage of the ww2 - and to any stage of the inter-allied relations , either . 
  ps : nvm , i seem to have found the inspiration . 
  it 's * germany must perish * by one theodore newman kaufmann . 
  it was a really sick manifesto , - advocating forced sterilization of all the germans , among other things - and it features a rough map looking pretty much like this one . 
  and you 've got the prussian ssr ( not the kaliningrad oblast ) with the placenames supposedly taken from the extinct prussian language ( the one akin to the lithuanian and latvian ) , too . 
  it 's a complete mindfuck . 
  where have you found that ? 
  at first i 've taken it for a real propaganda piece of the period . 
  looks like someone on deviantart knows his/her job , because it looks very late 40s to me , with fonts , shades and all . 
  not yet . 
  i had in mind laying wreaths , not the parade . 
  anyway , that would have provided a perfectly valid excuse to not go to moscow . 
  btw , i do n't get why zeman does n't go to the ol & scaron ; any cemetery instead of moscow if he 's so keen on honoring the memory of the soviet soldiers fallen for the liberation of czechoslovakia ? 
  especially if czech republic is probably the only european state where celebrating v day on the 9th makes more sense than on the 8th . 
  did anyone invoked the argument of celebrating locally ? 
  do n't say that you did n't have it coming , man .

  it reminds me of that joke about a cardiologist in the gift shop . 
  such an attitude is grating indeed . 
  people who say these things must be sent to some depressive - or even not so depressive by the russian standards - factory town somewhere in russia to make them understand the difference . 
  what a bunch of stale stereotypes . 
  even that map in the beginning is better . 
  is that site legit at all ? 
  no way in hell i will do a handstand to read this .

  no , it 's poe 's law in action . 
  so the cordon sanitaire does n't hold anymore . 
  holy crap , what have they been at all those months ? 
  deciding whether they are to express ` deep concern ' or just ` concern ' will do ? 
  good on you . 
  seriously , whenever i read of your universities ' senior staff showing some spine in dealings with the state ( like the dean of famu in the tibetan flag affair ) , i envy you . 
  it 's becoming mainstream , and here 's the problem . 
  no , the stuff about round holes is plain wrong . 
  maybe it was supposed to have it according to some obscure production standards , but by early 90s it was a rather generic cheddar-like cheese . 
  basically a cheddar analogue . 
  you know , lately when i see people complaining about rome ( paris does get some flak for this , too ) being dirty , shabby and outright not what its theme park version is , i ca n't help but remember this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_3sna3hpj8, 
  there is some mobster chic in paying in wads of 500 $ notes , is n't it ? 
  and still no working proof of concept , let alone a commercial service . 
  not wishing to rain on the parade , but how are they planning to finance this ? 
  besides , 8 hours looks more like the time it takes to go from budapest to * prague * via bratislava ( i 've just checked this the other day ) . 
  i do n't pretend i know jack about them past the most basic idea ( death squads used for war on terror by an already supposedly democratic government and acting so dirty that they managed to annoy the french on whose territory they operated ) . 
  holy shit . 
  i feel pretty much the same . 
  so it did n't get better after gal stopped operating ? 
  one would have hoped ... 
  eta or no eta , torture is an absolute evil . 
  loved that picture with , what , ten magpies ? 
  on the other hand : * ... and ten for the devil his own self * run away !, 
  i think they just meant that if norway did so ( in a highly improbable turn of events ) , people would n't object because of their trust into institutions . 
  i felt pretty much the same about politico , too . 
  whatever their u.s. branch is , sometimes , the european one reads like what a stereotypical republican would like to hear about the eu . 
  glad ( sorta kinda ) to know that it is n't just me . 
  nothing special about this . 
  the french have always awarded l\u00e9gion d'honneur to visiting foreign dignitaries , it 's basically part of their diplomatic etiquette . 
  it is n't even said what grade has been awarded ( chevalier is the lowest and most common , grande-croix is the highest ) , which is a significant detail . 
  this is what i thought , too . 
  actually , the first stretch of the london underground ( from paddington to farringdon , iirc ) initially served to connect the mainline tracks , too . 
  so if it 's agreed that the lu dates from the 1860s , why not the athens metro ? 
  like i said , it was an urban legend , often used as a cautionary tale against the horrors of consumerism and ` cringing before the west ' , whatever that meant . 
  i heard it when i was a kid from my elementary school teacher . 
  for not entirely sucking up to putin . 
  it 's a matter of expectations vs. reality . 
  ah , that 's a russian urban legend dating from the ww2 times and the lend-lease shipments . 
  people used to tell that american canned meat and especially spam are made from rats , horses and whatever inedible animal the one who was telling the story could come up with . 
  well , let 's begin that the ussr severed all the ties with israel over the six day war and has n't restored them until late 1991 ( just two months before its breakup ) . 
  as for the propaganda proper , pretty much every war waged by the israelis has been represented as an act of pure unprovoked agression , and the anti-israeli terrorist attacks ( even the worst ones , like in munich in 1972 ) were glossed over . 
  all of this was complemented by the low-key soviet antisemitism ( as a matter of fact , the soviet jews were represented * as * jews only if they had to say something against israel ) . 
  thank you for the clarification , i stand corrected . 
  here in russia , at least some of the liberals are excessively pro-israeli just because ( i 'm reproducing this way of reasoning ) the soviet propaganda spared no effort to tell how evil israel was , therefore it must be the real good guys . 
  but then , there are enough russian liberals rooting for pinochet exactly for the same reason . 
  i do believe there is a cover up on the russian side , but it 's the hanlon 's razor in action : the russian ( military ) ground services had things fubar and therefore the russian authorities are unwilling to admit their gross incompetence . 
  you mean the goods produced in the settlements , right ? 
  i 've got a feeling that the cee eu members ( the czech republic , poland , slovakia , hungary ) are much more pro-israeli than the old ones . 
  it must have something to do with the cold war commie propaganda they have been fed and the reaction to it . 
  the `` issue '' you 're speaking about exists only for the police , tax collectors , judges and banks . 
  pretty every average joe/jane will be happy if there is no limit on cash transfer , even if s/he is mostly paying by card in his/her everyday life . 
  money laundering has been made a crime only to make easier the life of the cops , taxmen and judges who do n't have anymore to collect evidence on the suspect 's real crimes . 
  that sounds like a cop out . 
  i 'm speaking of shops that could give change , but would n't just because something something money laundering .

  we can tell kids that having blue or brown eyes are variants of norm or that tuberculosis is a dangerous contagious disease that should be prevented and cured . 
  those things are known . 
   who determines what is propaganda or anti-pc ? 
  we have experts for this . 
  in soviet times it was realized that propaganda is a valuable and powerful weapon . 
  we used it against the , the west used it against us , it 's not a secret at all . 
   the problem is that `` bad '' is highly subjective and always tends to end up meaning `` we do n't like it . '', 
  the problem is that nobody in the whole word understands real causes of homosexual behavior in humans . 
  like : `` mutation in gene x is causing it , it occurs with probability y '' . 
  or `` prion bodies of type z cause it '' . 
  or `` it is a consequence of viral infection with agent g combined with variation of gene h '' . 
  or `` using that kind of hypnotic suggestion cause it '' , i do n't know . 
  in the west scientific discussion on this topic was effectively stopped many years ago . 
  scientific knowledge was substituted with unexplained decisions of political lobby . 
  i suspect that new unbiased studies in the west wo n't start in the nearest future since politicians are scared of finding possible causes and do n't know what to do with this data . 
  especially in case if epidemiological hypothesis will turn to be correct . 
  until then we will have political decisions instead of rational ones . 
  some politicians will state that `` this is ok '' , other politicians will state that `` this is sin '' , third ones will suggest that it is a result of propaganda and so on . 
  think about it . 
   it is natural , it does exist in various species , you do n't `` catch '' gay-ness by being around gay people , you ca n't turn people/children gay by talking about the topic in factual ways etc. 
  what do you think about creationism in school education ? 
  certainly it 's a widespread opinion . 
  our society decided that we should n't teach our children about creationism as a leading point of view since we prefer scientific evolutionary explanation . 
  as of homosexual behavior , saying that `` it 's good , it 's natural '' and so on does n't have a solid scientific base . 
  i mean really unbiased results . 
  currently it 's a belief , like creationism . 
  some people believe in it , some not . 
  we do n't . 
   i 'm curious what you mean by `` hostile '' though . 
  any training of activists which could be used by external forces to ruin our country is hostile . 
  examples of an `` arab spring '' and so-called `` color revolutions '' shows that there is a technology to ruin countries from inside in interests of other countries . 
  this anti-propaganda law is aimed not at homosexuals as i have said already , it 's aimed against foreign technology of instigating revolutions . 
   and those laws are actively being used as excuses for persecuting lbgt people in russia as per hrw above . 
  in russia a lot of people are persecuted for various reasons . 
  is it a big surprise that some of them are homosexuals ? 
  i do n't think so . 
   do you have any non-russian-state affiliated source for this ? 
  for example , [ hacked archive ] ( http://soros.dcleaks.com ) of george soros structures . 
  if you have some spare time , you can search it yourself , most materials are in english . 
  i have n't read it all of course , but really enjoyed search results on `` ukraine '' and `` russia '' in europe and eurasia sections . 
  especially concerning russian ngo 's funding , protocols of soros meetings with ukrainian politicians , budgets of payed articles in western press . 
  very revealing reading . 
  how `` reputable ngo 's '' just serve current political needs . 
  we do n't have `` anti-gay '' laws , we have anti-propaganda laws limiting activity of openly hostile organizations . 
  for a long years a lot of ngo 's funded from abroad existed in free and open manner until it was revealed that some of them had hostile purposes . 
  the law is n't directed at homosexuals , it 's directed at a bunch of activists with foreign funding . 
  as you know , we , russians , are experts in propaganda ourselves . 
  we know how it works . 
  no , we do n't need . 
  to make it happen they would need to capture our territory and make us surrender , that 's how wars are ended if you wish monetary contributions and territorial gains . 
  otherwise , eu as their new patrons pays for the instigated coup and its consequences . 
  ikea meatballs !, 
  to find a solution with our help rhetorics should be changed . 
  their civil war could be ended fully in a week . 
  their politicians do n't need this kind of solution . 
  haha . 
  they are not independent anymore , new potential coup is eu 's problem now . 
   she has received international recognition for her work a jar of jam and a pack of cookies ? 
  right now it 's -8 outside , wind is 7 m/s and it 's late evening . 
  we remember it every year and it would continue until survivors of wwii are alive . 
  almost every family suffered losses , it 's still a vivid part of our life . 
  when those people would pass away , this page of history would be turned , as it already happened , for example , with wwi . 
  what did you think , they 'll replicate your current governmental building ? 
  no  they 'll made a historical park , even with vintage submarine !, 
  when i was a kid , i enjoyed such games at [ poklonnaya gora ] ( https://www.poklonnayagora.ru/?part=8 ) museum in moscow . 
  it was nice to spin a handle of an old howitzer or to climb onto a tank ... 
   i weep for you if you ca n't see the difference between computer games sold by private companies in democracies and a real life theme park kids would play in the fresh air instead of sitting on their butts and staring into monitors . 
  the one that was sieged in 1945 . 
  nice game for kids . 
  instead of playing computer games sitting on their butts , they will have fun at fresh air . 
  [ some in-depth statistics ] ( http://crimea.gks.ru/wps/wcm/connect/rosstat_ts/crimea/ru/statistics/ ) for you . 
  in short , their local budget deficiency in 2017 is just 51 millions euro which is far less than in 2016 ( 315 millions ) . 
  islam , buddhism and judaism are protected also , we have regions where those religions are major . 
  you do n't get it : religious organizations in russia is just big organizations with their own interests . 
  big business corporations . 
  they have enough power to stand for their interests . 
  when some kid download a new film in the west , he could get insanely big fine for doing it , just because some large media corporation thinks that their rights are somehow violated .

  it really depends on conditions of a peace treaty . 
  there are possible variants that would leave ukraine alone in peace , like obligations not to participate in military alliances , not to be associated with other states , to respect new statuses of their former territories and so on . 
  it 's totally possible and realistic , they just dream that their new friends would solve their problems . 
   than to admit that your country is managed horribly wrong this sub is also a place for anti-russian propaganda with a bunch of same users posting articles hostile my country on a daily basis . 
  source sites are not banned , to the contrary , such posts are welcomed since they fit nicely in eu 's propaganda course . 
  i do n't like hypocrisy . 
  political ideas , when stripped out of nice rhetorics , are simple . 
  if ukraine had lost crimea , they 've lost it . 
  claiming it to be their land is the same as taiwan claims on mongolia . 
  no one will help them to take it back - they have nothing to provide in exchange because it would be damn costly and dangerous . 
  if ukraine has an ongoing civil war , it has it . 
  they could blame russia in all their problems of course and even declare a war to us , but they wo n't do it since they need civil war to whine endlessly and to ask for more international aid and loans . 
  if they 'd intended to end it , it 's a matter of a week , no more . 
  sign a peace treaty , establish border , admit that war is lost , live further . 
  instead ukrainian politicians rely on slowly burning conflict which is simply profitable for them . 
  they are businessmen after all . 
  their former president was a businessman also , his mistake was in decision to take russian money while underestimating eu and us power to protect their interests and overturn him like some arabian leader . 
  the same right that gives eu and us politicians an ability to instigate coups , to invade other countries like afghanistan , iraq , libya or yugoslavia , or to proclaim independence of kosovo . 
  the right of power and will . 
  please do n't start again this sad tale about poor occupied ukraine .

  it 's not even putin 's invention - it was used in georgia 10 years prior to his presidency , then in moldova , then in georgia again - and in georgia eu even participated in this crap and confirmed [ it was georgia 's fault that russian federation has invaded them ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8281990.stm ) . 
  of course now some people need to cover up their incompetency ( or maybe corruption ? ), 
  and they declare it 's the first time they see these methods . 
  ( if i were european bureaucrat at the moment i 'd start investigations against those who confirmed version of rufed how government has moved 150 + tanks to georgian border and evacuated nearly 20k ossetians 2 weeks prior to the war - without intention to invade georgia ), 
  if i cut off 7 languages which i know only up to the level of cursing words ( online gaming huehuehue ) - then 2 human languages + 5 programming languages . 
  i heard people who speak different languages have multiple characters depending on the language they speak and sometimes i wonder if i have different character ( s ) when i use various coding languages ? ... 
  no problem , it 's ok - i did n't mean you 've offended me , i just pointed out i still think the fall of ussr was worth it despite deaths of my grandfather and grand-grandmother and loss of real estate . 
  someone had to pay the price for our ( relatively ) free future ( + tbh last 10 years of ussr were crappy with all those goods deficits , suppressed ethnic conflicts , sudden exchange of currency ) . 
  it could be less painful - in more democratic country , maybe - but for a giant communist state it was extremely smooth and i believe next time it will be even more smooth since everyone know how to act and what to do when ( not `` if '' ) it will happen again ? 
  not to mention russian federation seems to be well prepared for this scenario ( separated bureaucratic systems in different regions , regional visa/citizenship system , etc. 
  i would n't call denying quality food for the population and raising taxes `` dick waving contest '' . 
  example of what is happening here : 2 weeks ago i 've purchased meat for ~ 9 $ / kg , now it 's ~ 12 $ / kg . 
  33 % growth in just couple weeks . 
  it is kazakhstan . 
  both people in the video are locals . 
  author of the video has stopped random car and ask its owner to explain - why does he have flag of russian federation ? 
  person explain his wife is from russian federation . 
  author of the video said he see usage of rufed 's flag in kazakhstan ( instead of flag of kazakhstan ) as inappropriate from his point of view ( `` you live here , in kazakhstan , not in rufed '' ) and ask the owner of the flag to remove it and promise to never display it again within kazakhstan . 
  note : kazakhstan state was somewhat friendly toward ethnic russians so far - and it was the only southern ussr republic where russians were n't expelled deliberately ( ethnic cleansing ) or `` accidentally '' ( civil war between locals ) . 
  nope , not sure . 
  it 's still funny though . 
  i like how you are explaining it to one of those refugees whose family members were killed in the process . 
  i assure you - i am ok with ussr fall , it was right thing to do - just like putting down a dog with cancer instead of letting it to suffer for years . 
  if we wo n't allow rufed to fall apart peacefully kremlin will start a lot more wars + in the end it will be either best korea or yugoslavian scenario ( with possible use of thermonuclear weapons ) . 
  clearly a state which participated in / started 6 wars in 23 years can not exist within geographical borders of europe in xxi century . 
  if you 've forgot - it was yeltsin who started wars in chechya , abkhzaia and transistria . 
   it actually made everyone happy . 
  correct , i am in eastern europe and i feel so good about ussr fall ( despite loss of family members ) i want to see it again with rufed . 
  it is the right / good thing unlike pro-longing the agony of this dying empire for few more decades ( rufed * will * start more wars , kremlin has already started 6 wars in 23 years ) . 
  there is no need for `` yugoslavian situation '' since russian federation has its own - much better - `` ussrian situation '' which made everyone happy and went without any major conflicts . 
  both conflicts are exactly the same as in ukraine - artificially created by kremlin to prevent moldova and georgia joining nato ( and later eu ) . 
  allowing rufed to continue ussr 's trend and fall apart again would be a good start to reunite these countries . 
  30 seconds in google resulted in this marvel :  the war in georgia last year was started by a georgian attack that was not justified by international law , an eu-sponsored report has concluded . 
  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8281990.stm it 's very `` funny '' how international laws allowed russian federation to invade moldova and georgia under guise of `` peacekeepers '' in `` ethnic conflicts '' . 
  and it 's strange to see the very same laws do n't allow kremlin to do exactly the same in ukraine . 
  they use term `` civil war '' for invasion of rufed 's army . 
  nice piece of propaganda . 
  by the way , guys , as it is clear now - who are the bad guys in georgia and transistria + how bad are they - is there anything eu is going to do to help moldova and georgia to repel invasions of russian federation disguised as protection in ethnic conflicts ? 
  i remember 6 years ago there was a commission formed by european countries which declared it 's all georgians ' fault , so rufed * had * to invade them . 
  it say these war games are the answer to ( planned ) nato wargames in ukraine , these are extremely big ( 400 mechanized units including fighter jets and icbm carriers ) and their theme is to hide from satellites , to avoid attacks of fighter jets which use high precision weapons ( e.g. 
  to launch icbms no matter what ) . 
  as i said before - it look like the government is getting ready for wwiii . 
  and the best way to prevent it once and forever is to stop buying oil and gas and allow them to bankrupt themselves in couple years . 
   kgb agent not every kgb agent is good agent . 
  also power corrupt people and it look like vladimir vladimirovich is 2nd most powerful person in the world ( if not first ) . 
  ( also i believe vvp does n't participate in debates only because he had lost both attempts when he was right hand of sobchak ), 
  no problem !, 
  i 'm doing this for a year already . 
  however lately i almost do n't read/watch russian media ( except for few sites ) because there are almost no sources of information which do n't look like disgusting propaganda and i 've seen how under its pressure even smart people start to use terms `` mercenaries '' , `` fascists '' , `` nazis '' , etc. 
  toward ukrainians and eu/us and `` jews '' , `` fifth column '' , `` nation-traitors '' towards russians who are n't pro-kremlin . 
  i 'm afraid stupidity and apathy are contagious . 
  1 ) putin is awful public politician with zero to none debates experience , he speaks his mind openly ; 2 ) apparently `` ex-ussr territory is belong to us '' doctrine does not presume there are any long-term allies - only future targets for `` protective/humanitarian invasions '' . 
  after 23 years kazakhs have finally realized that , belorussians probably too .

  i heard south korean border guards use ropes and hold each other to prevent them being snatched and abducted by north korean soldiers . 
  perhaps neighbors of russian federation should start using the same tactics on their borders since rufed is turning into best korea anyway . 
  1 ) content changes hourly as both kremlin and separatists pretend they do n't know exact plan and act independently and 2 ) content does n't matter - result is defined in kremlin already , it 's the same as it was in georgia and moldova ( wasteland with handful of locals and `` russian peacekeepers '' around , readying next invasion ) . 
  right now kremlin is trying to force president of ukraine to pretend separatists are n't the kremlin itself ( and are n't just pro terrorists sent by kremlin but legitimate representatives of non-existent `` nation '' ) and start talking to them instead of kremlin . 
  for kremlin it embarrassing when poroshenko talk to them directly about peace - it `` uncover '' them as the other side of conflict . 
  at least kremlin has decency not to ask `` malaysian airlines '' to compensate cost of `` buk '' missile . 
  no problem . 
  however it should be noted that most citizens of rufed never change their place of residence thus do n't have a clue about actual situation and think it 's just like in every other country around . 
  i myself could n't understand - what is going on with all the excessive bureaucratic procedures ? 
  - till realized country is separated into pieces as if government was readying to a war or revolution ( separated regions still can act if some of them are lost ) and has exploited `` divide at impera '' principle to the point where association agreement with eu result in closer relationships than exist between rufed 's bureaucrats in different regions . 
  except for in russian bureacratic language * registracia * means `` regional citizenship '' and `` property ownership rights '' . 
  i guess it 's kind of sarcasm or doublespeak : * registracia * assumes minor procedure which should be quick and easy , but in reality exactly the opposite is happening . 
  multiple people went to jail in 3 major siberian cities for `` siberian federalization '' event . 
  ( what guy ? 
  where were many ), 
  what kind of information you need ? 
  there is n't much available because publishing articles with titles like `` our regions are less integrated than eu countries '' may result in jail term for `` enticing separatism '' . 
  citizens complain all the time about difficulties of legal ways to obtain * registracia * - apartments with this option usually cost more ( i guess they pay for `` protection '' of police to evict problematic tenants if needed ) . 
   travelling there on a car registered in moscow is a really bad idea i deliberately posted the video from tsukerova balka because these bastards search me each time i pass them + 3-4 times on the road afterwards during like 1-2 hours - no matter if i ( do n't ) have passengers ( friends or family ) . 
  and every time i hear speeches like `` next time use train or airplane , muscovite , we do n't want your kind here '' . 
  these are so-called `` kuban cossacks '' - our `` slavic brothers '' and `` countrymen '' , not chechens , ingush , dagestani . 
  here are speculations of educated insider . 
  if eu and us will provide slightly higher pressure ( some more sanctions + help to georgia , ukraine , moldova ) - there is good chance to see the fall of soviet reunion before world cup 18 . 
  it seems kazakhstan is already moving into this direction after recent phrase of putin how kazakhstan was created on a territory which never had any state on it - and belarus is openly exploit customs union to bypass kremlin 's self-inflicted sanctions and organize government-sponsored `` contraband '' of forbidden products from eu into russian federation . 
  it 's serious but it wo n't lead to new cold * war * - just a couple * cold battles * maybe - because population of rufed is close to boiling point ( it 's obvious kremlin has nothing to offer to develop the country - only prayers for higher prices of oil and gas and invasions into nearby countries ) , government 's bankruptcy and/or severe sanctions may spark explosion of separatism . 
  either rufed will remove putin and its government from control ( and army from ukraine , moldova , georgia ) or there is serious possibility for the `` empire '' to go belly up in couple years . 
  i bet local bureaucrats already have plans what to do as separate countries , in fact [ there are already ready-to-use customs post structures * inside * rufed ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacjjl4wvsu ) + regions of rufed already act as separate states , they have less integration than countries in eu and that is why kremlin was so hysterical about ukraine and georgia signing association agreement with eu - because it 's almost the same level of integration as relations between regions within rufed . 
  another example : when a citizen move between regions of rufed she/he need passport and * visa on arrival * ( a.k.a. 
  `` registracia '' ) which is strongly linked to property ownership rights and act more like `` localized/temporary citizenship '' ( if you do n't own another real estate you can legally live within estate where you have * registracia * indefinitely without consent of other tenants ) so citizens either have to purchase real estate to acquire `` localized citizenship '' or bribe someone to get their passport stamped with local visa - i heard about case where 40,000 ( ! ), 
  people were illegally registered within the same real estate property in sochi ( by fsb itself , mind you ) . 
  anyway i do n't trust any reports which imply 100k `` strong '' abkhazian micro-nation ( half of which has fled to russia almost immediately ) could win a war against 2 millions georgians without direct involvement of russian army . 
  persons who wrote those reports should be checked for mental illnesses and/or bribery . 
  those 100k abkhazian even had `` their own '' fighter jet ( s ) which bombed georgians . 
  also i do n't remember * any * hrw representatives in abkhazia in 90s . 
  i guess if they 'd actually were there it could stop ethnic cleansing when people were killed in queues for bread for being half-georgian ( grandfather of my classmate in gudauta ) or russian ( my grandfather ) . 
  perhaps hrw should take less bribes from kremlin + media are perfectly aware about [ witnesses ] ( http://cyxymu.livejournal.com/ ) , they just did n't give a crap till exactly the same scenario started to work near eu borders . 
  some history . 
  21 years ago rufed offered truce between `` abkhazian rebels '' ( i.e. 
  army of rufed + chechens + handful of abkhazians ) and georgians in abkhazia . 
  both sides were asked to withdraw troops as far as possible from front line + to give up spare parts of artillery which would prevent its usage . 
  later it turned out only naive georgians removed their troops and disabled artillery so `` abkhazian rebels '' took capital of abkhazia ( and the rest of the region ) almost without any resistance . 
  1 ) rufed already does not operate within internationally recognized borders ( after annexation of crimea ) , it destroyed `` pax americana '' ( nobody annexed anything during 70 years ) and i bet us/gb/au / canada will provide a lot of pressure ; 2 ) rufed was n't created by will of its population but rather as a chunk of bigger structure and by will of corrupted bureaucrats , it does not have too much support among population ( up to suppressed civil wars in caucasus region , brewing separatism movements across whole country including regions populated by russians ) and with some pressure ( see 1 ) ) wo n't survive next deep crisis in single piece . 
  good news : russian federation does not operate as single country , but rather as a set of multiple separate quasi-states which have less integration than countries in eu - for example to move between regions ~ ~ you ~ ~ citizens need passport * and visa on arrival * ( without such visa there will be troubles with job search and local police ) - so fall will be almost `` painless '' , just like it happened with 1991 with ussr .

  we 're not trying to become a superpower , mind you . 
  i get that this is a popular meme in the west , but we do n't have the capacity to . 
  russia is trying to fill the niche it has carved for itself historically , namely one of a regional power around the eastern europe , the siberian wastelands , and the central asian deserts . 
  there is no competition on the global scene , as some like to paint it , there is competition where it concerns russian interests in the region . 
  you do n't see us messing around in central africa , sea , or south america . 
  as for the closer ties to the western countries , [ guess how many times russia tried to join nato .

  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/17/russia.iantraynor ), 
  because laws , regulations , and constitutions exist . 
  exhibit 1 , the right to life . 
  in most countries , murder is outlawed . 
  would you call murder a crime or a violation of human rights ? 
  most call it a crime . 
  would you call a death sentence a crime or a violation of human rights ? 
  there 's a country on this planet , a rather important one , where it 's neither . 
  exhibit 2 , the right to freedom of opinion and expression . 
  would you call the persecution of isil recruiters a violation of human rights ? 
  would you call the persecution of people or an organization suspected in attempting a revolt a violation of human rights ? 
  we can continue doing this for every article of the unjversal declaration . 
  all of the problems that are called human rights violations nowadays are regulated by local law . 
  when a government is accused of violating human rights , it 's in most cases a gentle way to state `` we do n't like your local laws '' or `` we do n't like how you execute your local laws '' packed into a fancy lunchbox . 
  `` that country violates human rights '' sounds better than `` look , we have a problem with what that country wrote in its laws '' , because the latter sounds like an attack on sovereignity . 
  ca n't have that . 
   and that 's simply russia pursuing its own interests - it 's just a shame that russia 's interests require holding countries hostage in order to prevent them from joining with russia 's perceived enemies . 
  exactly . 
  that 's what the big politics are all about , pursuing your own interests , measuring the consequences , making decisions , then justifying them to your population . 
  case in point , the second ukrainian revolt in xxi century . 
  russian interest : to retain close political ties with a country populated by people with a similar language , culture , largely shared history , and same religion . 
  nato interest : to further reduce russian influence close to russian borders , preferrably to remove it at all . 
  nato decision : observe ; the eu association process is good enougb for a start . 
  russian decision : exploit eu 's penny-pinching and propose an economic deal undisputably more beneficial for ukraine . 
  consequence : eu association halted . 
  russian reaction : observe . 
  nato reaction : remove the unwanted political force from the picture in ukraine via a color revolution scenario . 
  consequence : yanukovich deposed , replaced by a nato-friendly government . 
  nato reaction : observe . 
  russian reaction : salvage the critical assets in reach . 
  consequence : crimea . 
  it all works on very basic and pragmatic principles . 
  there 's little room for emotion or compassion in intrernational politics , it 's business . 
   i really do n't want to have mix of `` multi-culti '' with `` white man burden '' as you offer oh i dare you point to a specific sentence where i 've mentioned either . 
  you know full well what kind of re-education i 'm talking about here and how much the proponents of multiculturalism , `` human rights '' and other first world constructs hate us for employing it in the past . 
  as for the borders , our southern border with nato . 
  to believe independent `` ichkeria '' and dagestan will stand unaffected by american and turkish influence is naive . 
  you do have some for yourself though . 
  or are you one of those know-it-alls that have a solution for everything , and bail the country when things go sour faster than the euromaidanites bailed theirs ? 
  you 're saying that we should undermine our own national security by weakening our borders , and create at least two hot zones right next to ourselves , all for the sake of getting rid of an ethnicity or two that you do n't like . 
  that is one of the most pathetic ideas you as a russian can come up with . 
  look at our history . 
  in early 1200s , there was an ethnicity more violent and dangerous in our lands . 
  where is that ethnicity now , and where are we ? 
  and yet you propose to shame our predecessors by running away from a smaller problem . 
  the solution is reeducation , which our country has done plenty of times before . 
  i do understand that the current government is ill suited for this task , but secession equals capitulation . 
  that 's what i 'm saying , secession precedent wo n't lead to less misery . 
  if served in a right way , pretty many . 
  not a majority , i 'd guess , but a noticeable amount . 
  what they do n't get , though , is that a single breakaway region sets a precedent . 
  that , and cutting border territories that lie in rough terrain means willingly endagering border security . 
  no whining about human rights , and we have a deal . 
  [ this would be a good advice to our ambassadors , ' :*) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw2kkyju9gy&amp;t=130s ) edit : if we 're talking seriously , it 's not a question of money . 
  take the imperial borders , substract poland and finland ( so better just take the unionite borders ) , and that 's going to be a rough estimate of where most of the people 's border of `` we have zero reasons to spread further '' lies . 
  poland has been too latinized from the beginning of our common history , same goes for other slavic countries within the germans ' immediate vicinity . 
  we do n't have enough in common to form a common country peacefully . 
  even if by some miracle poland ends up within our borders tomorrow , what are we to do with it ? 
  even the communists , with all the mistakes they made about handling nationalities , understood that assimilating it would require an amount of time incomparable to history 's pace . 
  that was 60 years ago , and history has n't been slowing down since . 
  it 's not impossible , there are methods for that , some more effective , some with less collateral damage , but the general order of magnitude is compared to the life expectancy in the assimilated region ( because that 's the measure of how fast the verbal legacy of a culture dwindles ) . 
  i 'm not an expert , i 'm talking out of my ass here , but let 's say that poland 's assimilation takes two full lifetimes , so around 1.5 century . 
  can anyone vouch that europe stays calm for so long ? 
  hell , we 've had two global wars over the course of xx century , and i 'm pretty sure humanity can find a way to circumvent mad and have another blast killing itself in this one . 
  even in such a simplified scenario , anyone vouch that borders stay the same after it ends ? 
  and that 's why integrating anything outside of what 's been proven as a reliable part of the country would be an irresponsible waste of resources at this point in time .

  the article you linked to has nothing to do with the topic , because the us is not a party of the rome statute . 
  but priority of constitution over international law is nothing unusual , you are right .

  photographs of public-domain 2d art are no longer considered copyrighted in the uk . 
  few years ago there was buzz around and accusations about wikipedia `` stealing '' photographs of 2d art from the british library and other british museums . 
  so this loophole to recopyright public domain content was removed -- in the uk . 
   south ossetia and the whole georgian soldiers shooting up the civilian city , then driving through it screaming racial slurs and demanding that women and children come out of the basements since they in there and kill them in their rush for the gori tunnel were a good example . 
  [ ... ] and georgians are more than happy to slaughter all ossetians , who are distinctly different from them in both ethnicity and religion . 
  the amount of nuclear idiocy per word in your post is just amazing . 
  i wonder where you got all that bullshit ? 
  if you are not a mind reader you should probably try to read these little black thingies . 
   the weaponry alone does n't win a war . 
  i do n't see anyone claiming the opposite . 
   ukraine 's military is alone on this one and they already failed even with western support . 
  ukraine did n't receive any serious western backing in that war . 
  neither financial nor military , even the sanctions on russia were pretty light . 
  no lethal weapons , no anti-tank missiles , even non-lethal supplies as radars were very limited . 
  it 's funny that `` moderate opposition '' in syria ( the one that was elected by nobody , is in alliance with al-qaeda and installs sharia law in every city it captures ) received far more western military aid in syria than ukrainian legitimately elected government . 
   yes , they could win , at the cost of a terrible bloodbath 9000 dead is not terrible bloodbath enough ? 
  ukraine can win this war . 
  of course , with serious domestic commitment and western backing ( money , lethal weapons , and so on ) . 
  putin is not suicidal , he will not escalate forever in a conflict that does n't bring anything valuable to russia . 
  russian military is strong , but it 's far from a magic unicorn that can destroy its enemies just looking at them . 
   there are in fact very few states around the world that qualify as stable liberal democracies . 
  [ ... ] if nothing else , europe 's refugee/migrant crisis points to a long-lasting east-west values gap when it comes to tolerance and diversity . 
  i am sorry to interject this guy , but being a liberal democracy has nothing to do with western european weird ideas about tolerance and diversity -- like covering-up rape in fear of being called racist . 
  putin handled the kursk disaster poorly , and major tv channels ort ( controlled by oligarch berezovsky ) and especially ntv ( controlled by gusinsky ) were very harsh in pointing out deficiencies of his handling . 
  he learned his lesson and took control over both of them in a few months . 
  they represent majority of the syrian opposition , on the north of syria , at least . 
  if the `` rebels '' ( in their current form ) will prevail and assad will be toppled , these groups will not be just included in government , they will be the government . 
  with sharia , public executions for weird reasons , women rolled up in fabric head-to-toe , oppression of minorities , and other cool stuff . 
  that 's what already happened on the territories they control , e.g. 
  yeah , it will be better than the isis , it will be more like `` just '' taliban , but it will be hardly any better than assad regime . 
   from all the syrian opposition groups in saudi arabia that 's already hilarious . 
   groups like al-nusra are excluded . 
  al-nusra was excluded , and that 's all . 
  they included other salafi jihadist groups like jaysh al-islam and ahrar al-sham . 
  even without clicking on the article i can guess the user in question . 
  it was long , long overdue . 
  unauthorized one-person protests are legal in russia , you do n't need permission for them . 
  so at first he was detained several times for unauthorized protests while most of them were one-person , _ then _ got 15 days arrest in january for one-person protest , and _ then _ he got 3 years in prison for repeated violation . 
  that 's a pretty crazy sentence for this harmless guy for staying with posters like `` je suis charlie '' and `` freedom to savchenko '' . 
  he is a closeted gay most likely . 
  everybody suspected he is not straight seeing him once -- his voice , mannerisms , he hosted gardening tv show , and so on . 
  he used his position to promote gay rights previously , protested against gay propaganda laws , said things like `` it 's ok to be gay '' . 
  it was writing on the wall . 
   have declared al-nusra enemies of the rebellion and attack them as well do they even have line of contact with al-nusra ? 
  anyway , i do n't believe that russia considers them terrorists or ever called them terrorists . 
  they expressed willingness to participate in dialogue with russia , while russia is ready to negotiate with `` healthy opposition '' . 
  it 's true that there were some bombing by russia in daraa province , but ** absolute majority ** of russian airstrikes were targeted at the northern islamist rebel groups allied with al-nusra & co. . maps of the russian airstrikes by the isw have whooping total of 2 ( two ) russian airstrikes recorded in the southern front controlled territory , see [ sept 30 - oct 28 ] ( http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/russian%20airstrikes%2028%20oct-01_5.jpg ) , [ oct 27 - nov 5 ] ( http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/russian%20airstrikes%2004%20-%2005%20nov%20updated-01_6.png ) , just like [ any ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/world/middleeast/syria-and-russia-continue-coordinated-assault-on-militants.html?_r=0 ) [ other ] ( http://theaviationist.com/2015/10/02/heres-an-interactive-map-of-all-the-russian-airstrikes-in-syria/ ) [ available ] ( http://www.vox.com/2015/10/7/9471271/russia-syria-bombing-map ) [ map ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34465425 ) . 
  yeah , because russia does n't do this . 
  russia never labeled like that the kurds , the only significant truly moderate opposition force in syria . 
  hopefully , the usa will stop to drink that `` moderate rebels '' and `` moderate fsa '' koolaid . 
  i read yesterday one pro-fsa guy , who unironically defended al-nusra as `` moderate wing of al-qaeda '' , fsa supporters with straight face use phrases like `` moderate islamists '' , `` very conservative groups '' ( ahrar ) , and so on . 
  if a group wants to be considered moderate , at the very least they should distance themselves from known jihadist groups . 
  good luck to sdf , hopefully , _ this _ project will be successful . 
  good . 
  that 's what russia is already doing . 
  russia bombs the isis , ahrar ash-sham , al-nusra , jaysh al-islam , other islamist groups and their allies . 
  russia does n't bomb the sdf and kurds , afaik . 
  they knew it very well . 
  that 's why they did n't shoot down russian planes in the previous airspace violation incidents , acting via diplomatic instruments . 
  oh these fairy tales about that invisible moderate army again . 
  too bad russia does n't believe in these dangerous bullshit delusions that led to the current catastrophic mess . 
  it seem the us also does n't really believe in them , too . 
  russia does n't bomb the real moderates , ypg . 
   yes , there are 70,000 moderate opposition fighters in syria . 
  here 's what we know about them faylaq al-sham ( sham legion ) , part of jaf , apparently is a moderate opposition group now , just like ajnad al-sham islamic union . 
  you ca n't make that shit up . 
  these guys are really desperate in searching `` moderate '' opposition . 
  it 's not like they were able to identify journalists on atgm range . 
  they just fired at groups of people . 
  these moderates work in tight cooperation with not so moderate al-nusra front and ahrar ash-sham , designated terrorist organizations . 
  they do things like capturing syrian pows and then handing them over to the less `` moderate '' guys , letting them do the dirty job for them . 
  just today one of the oldest `` moderate '' fsa brigades [ joined ahrar ash-sham ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3ug8iy/one_of_the_oldest_fsa_groups_alfateh_brigade_who/ ) . 
  assad is not a good guy , that 's for sure , but at the very least he is able to maintain somewhat semi-competent secular state in his country -- unlike these moderate guys . 
  that 's simple -- if you hear the war drums , your blood boils , and you start to support your leader even if you do n't particularly like him . 
  in russia there are also plenty of anti-putin people who started to talk about constantinople , recognition of the armenian genocide and so on . 
   futhermore , there was nothing `` clearly non-intentional '' about the violation at the time it happened . 
  you should just look at the map , the border has a twist there . 
  warplanes travel at ludicrous speeds , they ca n't immediately change their direction , and the russian planes worked at targets close to the border . 
  `` a short-term border violation can never be a pretext for an attack '' , as erdogan said after shooting down of the turkish f-4 . 
  of course , there was nothing threatening in the actions of our planes . 
  moreover , most likely they were shot at when they started to leave the turkish airspace . 
   two unidentified fighter i do n't buy the turkish bullshit that they did n't know it was a russian plane . 
  for example the syrian planes do n't operate in pairs . 
  they knew exactly what they were going to do . 
   at the time two unidentified fighter jets had disregarded all instructions to change their course and had failed to identify themselves despite multiple attempts to contact them . 
  those actions do fit the profile of possible hostiles they probably did n't listen that frequency . 
  just like the iran air flight 655 for example . 
  it was also `` warned multiple times '' -- too bad the crew did n't hear a single warning . 
   here 's a simple , common sense preventive measure : russia should simply stop with their airspace violations . 
  sure , the russian planes will be very careful avoiding entering the turkish airspace . 
  just like the turkish planes will be _ very careful _ not to violate the syrian airspace inside of s-400 's operational range . 
  i see nothing good happening with turkish proxies fighting in syria as well . 
  such is life . 
  erdogan shot himself in the foot . 
  they decided to shoot down our plane for clearly non-intentional 10s minor incursion into their airspace , the plane that did n't pose for them any danger . 
  then their so called `` turkmen '' proxies killed our parachuting pilot in violation of protocol i of the geneva conventions and then posed with his dead body .

  actually gdp growth was higher in [ eastern germany . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_german_democratic_republic#comparison_with_the_west_german_economy ), 
  well the ones who ordered this shall be in jail , not the ones who followed the order . 
  you can not really put gorbachev in jail , so there is that . 
  you are mistaken , for french and other resistances except polish ( it was bigger but not that significant ) . 
  supplies from us were important yes . 
  africa was not important for eastern front , because mussolini had no intentions to help on eastern front in any meaningful numbers , also bear in mind that strength of axis forces in africa was only 400 000 at peak - i.e. 
  comparable with casualties of england during the second front operations . 
   without the us cutting off japanese oil eventually leading them to attack the us , and the uk keeping them occupied in the meantime , they may have decided to push into siberia which may have caused the cowardly stalin to capitulate . 
  japanese had plans to invade yes , but only if three quarters of forces stationed in siberia would leave to fight germans . 
  they did not leave on paper , so japanese did not invade . 
  what ` s wrong with whataboutism actually ? 
  why nope ? 
  maybe it was the goal from the begining ? 
  stay with f-16 it is cheaper and basically does the same as the others . 
  if f-16 is not an option , then grippen . 
  it is cheaper in flyaway cost and maintenance and can supercruise . 
  will it help though ? 
  i do not understand how the situation will improve with tax harmonization . 
  just joking really . 
  they are the worst . 
  well if you are bombed by nato members you don ` t care if some article was invoked or not . 
  ha ha so you are implying no fly zone in syria meant the same ? 
  same diplomatic language , right ? 
   the same international `` laws '' russia breaks all the time ? 
  does not mean you could kill someone you don ` t like , because russia does this too . 
  actually russia did not break international laws before iraq and libya . 
  you were first in this development . 
  and you can surely believe they will tell you the truth , yes . 
  actually we agreed for no fly zone only , not bombing libya . 
  bombing was against all laws like iraq . 
  nah this situation is already decreases gdp growth . 
  people talking about robots like most of the industries are not already automated . 
  only like 20 % of people work in production sector in oecd . 
  the share may not even decrease considering automation will return production of many small goods to wealthier countries . 
  let ` s say the share will be 10 % in 50 years , what difference will it make ? 
  robots will pay for elderly ? 
  the problem is not shrinking population , like who cares ? 
  the problem is growing number of older people and shrinking number of youth . 
  maybe , my initial point that tendecies were the same until end of ww2 , including more liberalization and also kickbacks to autocracy . 
  yes , i know . 
  i don ` t why we are arguing actually , number of losses is irrelevant to my initial point . 
  like any other country . 
   5.3 is germany + all its allies in the east already . 
  you are being mistaken 5.3 it is only german losses with germans conscripted from other parts of europe , not including other axis powers themselves . 
  soviet losses higher yes but not like 4 to 1 , like that guy was saying . 
   8.5 million red army dead is a quite disputed number . 
  it is the smallest reasonable one in my opinion . 
  mean estimate is considerably higher . 
  there are differences yes , but 6.5 millions figure of direct combat losses is the same in many independent studies . 
  russian empire had more or less free press in the beginning of 20 century and was a constitutional monarchy with parliament having a lot of power . 
  it was not really different from france or britain at the time . 
  where do you get you figures from ? 
  it is 5.3 million for germany + 500 hundred thousands to 1 million for other axis powers + 80 to 100 hundred thousands for japan . 
  for soviets is 8.5 million dead , 2 millions of which died in pow camps . 
  so military losses are somewhat comparable . 
  anyway it is not the point of the discussion , the point was one regime survived the other did not . 
  it survived , the other ones did not . 
  maybe success not the right word , but you get the idea . 
   you recovered , but the 26 million dead was far more than was necessary to beat them . 
  you misinterpreting figures actually , 25 million is military + civilian losses , if soviets behaved like nazis on german soil , there would be the same losses . 
  soviet military losses are on par with losses of axis powers . 
   uh you rather won despite the regime , tbh . 
  stalin had made the soviet army quite weak by purging the officer core and the wehrmacht mowed through you like the terrible dreadnaught that it was . 
  you recovered , but the 26 million dead was far more than was necessary to beat them . 
  it is not about effectiveness , it is about the regime that survived . 
  in europe the same regimes died because of ww2 . 
   well it would have had a period where it would have been quite autocratic . 
  but that does not mean that the overall tendency for the last few centuries was not more authoritarian in russia than in the rest of europe . 
  these tendencies in europe and in russia were more or less the same until after ww2 . 
  it is because we won in ww2 and regime stayed proving itself somewhat successful . 
  if hitler won , europe would not be so democratic , that is for sure . 
  and i disagree completely about * in any point in time among the most authoritarian states around * . 
  russian empire was pretty liberal in later half of 19 and the beginning 20 century . 
  they are not that crazy . 
  depends on your defenition of an adequate standard of living . 
  ha ha , you do understand possible consequencies of such actions ? 
  noone in clear mind would do it , even us . 
   even if it was a stunt there is nobody else blame than russia . 
  it is a really strange mentality . 
  the point is she was 10 points ahead on polls and finished 2 points ahead in real life . 
  the same can happen with macron . 
  he will be ahead but not much , because everbody is sure he ` d win and stay home . 
  i understand the math , but saying you are winning by 20 points paints a good picture that is not there . 
  clinton was 10 points ahead by this logic and where is she now ? 
  choosing from 2 candidats is a zero sum game . 
  latest polls are 60 % vs 40 % it is not leading by 20 points , it is leading by 10 points . 
  le pen has a protest vote benefiting from low turnout . 
  if some share of his voters stays at home he may even lose . 
  depends on the turnout . 
  my guess he will win , but not with 20 points for sure . 
  i would say close to 5-10 points . 
  also , he does not have 20 points lead see the figure more closely . 
  well low pay for scientists persists in many countries , not many countries have women to fill the gap , that is the difference . 
  my guess , for the most part it ` s because of low pay , not the soviets . 
  men just do not want to work in science because of the wages . 
  same situation with bus and tramcar drivers . 
  tramcar drivers are almost exclusively women because of low pay ( most tramcars owned and operated by local governments ) . 
  it is about share of management jobs held by women , not owners of business . 
  ziggurat is more likely .

  - \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0434 , moskvabad , since there are many central asian immigrants in moscow and - abad is a common ending of place names there .

  well , if a person says that `` there is only dirt in russia '' he 's wrong and as it 's a judgement of a foreigner , he must have based the opinion on something , like websites devoted to negative information about russia . 
  servants of reptilian illuminati , obviously . 
  that 's your indoctrinated mind . 
  there are a lot of nice cities in russia besides moscow and saint pete . 
  for example , [ novosibirsk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt1t1wwut4o ) , [ yekaterinburg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js0a69rieqa ) , [ kazan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvucim6aeee ) - tatarstan ( muh opressed tatars ) , [ samara ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa-avpbhtia ) and so on . 
   but what about rossiysky whatabautism ukranian logic, 
   russians , belarusians , ukrainians , moldovans and probably tatars . 
  we do n't consider them foreigners , though . 
  that 's typical ignorant propaganda of people that judge russia based on stupid photos at the web . 
  immigrants are mostly asians or/and muslims . 
  not for long  , 
  gallup : 82.8 % of crimeans agree that referendum of independence from ukraine represents their views . 
  [ page 28 ] ( http://www.bbg.gov/wp-content/media/2014/06/ukraine-slide-deck.pdf ) . 
   `` the gravity , scale and nature of these violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world , '' if it 's that bad , why would people support the regime for so long ? 
  they are doing it to themselves . 
  propaganda workds during wars , revolutions and times of instability , but nk is a stable place . 
  it 's hard to understand . 
  something tells me , you are n't scottish . 
  i understand that nk is a shitty distopian place . 
  but i 'm wondering how exactly is it worse than ussr or yugoslavia . 
  maybe the reason of their bad life is not a comic book maniak under power that kills his girlfriends and ministers with artillery , but real sanctions and isolation that cripple their economy and make them starve . 
   more than 1 % of north korea 's citizens live in labour camps so in prisons . 
  ( like g.u.l.a.g. 
  is an acronym for prison system , not some crazy `` gulag '' place ) . 
  you say 1 % . 
  then , first , what is the source of the number ? 
  and second , the us the number of inmates is 0.73 % . 
  the difference is not that big , actually . 
   has 3 ( ! ), 
  parties and many independent so if we put away south korean propaganda , the north might turn out a much more normal place . 
  the mem looks so innocent it 's almost pro-russian . 
  western propagandists , do you even try ? 
  draw a drunk bear covered with mauled body parts or something . 
  like in case of referendum on scottish independence . 
  ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ a ^ ^ joke ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ defensive . 
  i believe it will happen someday . 
  but we have to do a lot of work before it is possible . 
  btw putin is 62 , he 's got 10-15 years at max as a leader . 
   all of russia should be developed though . 
  only 25 years went after devastating collapse , and it 's hard to develop everything equally , especially places like chechnya , dagestan and other ethnic republics or harsh climate regions . 
   it 's mind boggling how much is achieved despite the spectacularly bad governance . 
  well , maybe our governance was n't that bad in the end . 
  and all problems were caused by wars , rebellions and revolutions we were forced to deal with . 
   reduced to a petro state and arms dealer do n't forget nuclear power and space . 
  and there is much more than this . 
  it 's how history works , dumbo , look at the size of us military spending . 
  you gain resources , then you secure it . 
  your country leads even more aggressive and egoistic foreign policy , not talking about how you gained your land in the first place . 
  but nobody sanctions you , because no one cares about justice and rights . 
  we were stupid to believe the west in the 90s and it wo n't happen again , we 'd better arm china to fuck you up for good . 
  whites will be minority relatively soon , so the decline of pax americana is near . 
  `` russia is a dwarf '' was said by swedish charles xii , before he was rekt . 
  our internet is rather free , so i do n't see much of a difference . 
   like from ukraine ? 
  read about the history of novorossiya , it was called wild fields before russians came , built cities and developed the region . 
   like it paid when you bankrupted yourself in the 80s trying to match the us in technology ? 
  communism was a mistake . 
  it pays now , having all resources and potential . 
  ahead in what fields ? 
  your culture , military , art , population , science , land , language , wealth , resources and etc. 
  all small not influential and underdeveloped . 
  our standard of living maybe a bit lower because we have great goals , like taking and securing maximum land , or be the first in space . 
  but it pays with time . 
  according to international law they can act as they want . 
  free media does n't mean it 's unbiased . 
   it could be at least twice as good , if it was n't run by corrupt oligarchs .

   polish news site posting an article about poles being blameless victims again . 
  against the narrative as fuck . 
  are you accusing them in spreading unjust propaganda ? 
  also . 
  the article about a monument for poles massacred by ukrainians , a monument that was vandalized by nationalistic symbols and blown up . 
  it happened in ukraine . 
  how can you possibly spin as a polish fault ? 
   yeah , when nazis like you come to power around the world , everything suddenly becomes very interesting !, 
  i do n't even know what to say to that . 
  that 's an interesting statement , based on a thoroughly thought through conclusions drawn from indisputable facts . 
  because ukrainians , any of them , can do no wrong !, 
  i absolutely agree !, 
  it 's amazing , is n't it ? 
  it 's a western media outlet , posting something which goes against the general narrative in a very sensitive topic . 
  such topics are always the best here . 
  sometimes / r/europe is very entertaining !, 
  how does it contradict the article i linked ? 
   nice , did you just deny the russian presence in ukraine ? 
  in crimea , no . 
  in donetsk and lugansk , yes . 
  we keep hearing about the awesome russian invasion force and the brave ukrainian army holding the line , while failing to show a single russian soldier . 
  weapons supplies , some old apcs ( painted for a desert environment , seems like leftovers from afghanistan ) , and advisers are surely there , but troops , not likely . 
   you must be getting mad at me , down voting everything i post . 
  you realize it 's not a private chat , right ? 
  oh right . 
  i forgot . 
  those russian subversion cells everywhere . 
  right next to the troops covered by cloaking fields . 
  roughly 900km through the country . 
  through the border or \\ and a warzone line . 
  with explosives in a bag . 
  does it sound realistic ? 
  do you really have such a low opinion on ukrainian military , intelligence and police ? 
  you honestly have no clue what you 're talking about . 
  you 're free to look into my post history to see that this assessment of my political worldview ca n't be further from truth . 
  however , at the same time . 
  in case of russia , more often than not you can see a very clear general consensus branding its political system , culture , people and history as a monolith . 
  and it 's the case with most other countries as well in here . 
  this is why it 's so entertaining to read sometimes . 
  yeah , i 'm entertained . 
  it 's a very interesting contrast in this subreddit . 
  if something like that would happen in russia , the entire subreddit riles up to accuse russian barbarism . 
  however , with ukraine it goes against the narrative and there is a clear dissonance because of that . 
  on one hand , it 's ukraine , the oppressed victim that should be supported no matter what . 
  on the other hand , they 're not without their flaws either . 
  the reaction even in this thread is very interesting to observe . 
   well you seems to like your leader ... that 's reason enough to think that . 
  some do . 
  most indifferent as long as we 're not living in a complete shit anarchy and poverty , like in 90s for example . 
  many do n't support him , however , apathy is strong and these people do n't even bother to vote as `` there is no point '' . 
  a few actively going against him and ready to support anyone who 's not putin , no matter how messed up this other one is . 
  russians are not the single-minded hive-mind nation . 
  i personally believe that in the start of 2000s his influence was positive to achieve at least some semblance of order in this country , but later this iron grip completely choked out any reasonable political movements rendering our political system dysfunctional . 
  russian democracy was very young when it was derailed like that and because of that , it will take years to restore . 
  now we have a system that is bound to go into a complete disarray when there is no more putin . 
  plus again . 
  the reason many gathered `` around '' putin is because he 's promising to `` protect russia from any attempts of foreign forces to undermine it '' . 
  and your politicians are playing right into his hand by supporting and propping up people like hadarkovsky ( an oligarch from the 90s . ), 
  or navalny ( mostly despised russian nationalist , rich corruptioner pretending to be against corruption ) . 
  these are only a couple of the most prominent examples . 
  there are many more people supported by `` the west '' yet despised in russia . 
   so what if they are ? 
  have you ever lived with communists in charge ? 
  my parents did , they hate them all even 2 and a half decades later . 
  it 's insane and while they might be better than isis , it 's not by a huge margin . 
  edit : a word, 
   obvious russian provocation and you know it how ? 
  or is it a simple conclusion , because otherwise it goes against the narrative , against your political worldview ? 
  edit : typo, 
  no , but denying that there are hardliner nazis in ukraine is as foolish as exaggerating their numbers . 
  all it takes , a couple of radicalized kids . 
   then again , you ** do ** ? 
  and , are we ? 
  we never claimed that we know what 's best for everyone . 
  well . 
  you 're claiming it was done by a random russian as some sort of a diversion . 
  because how could [ the peaceful , all loving , totally not nationalistic ukraininas ] ( https://www.yahoo.com/news/thousands-ukraine-nationalists-march-kiev-193807371.html?ref=gs ) do something like that ] . 
  are you even reading what you 're typing ? 
  by the way , it 's extremely cold right now in ukraine so they 're wasting more gas than planned , will have to buy more . 
  is it a russian ploy as well ? 
  that 's my point . 
   controlling huge part of ukraine really makes it really difficult to get into other parts of ukraine . 
  if this happened in eastern ukraine obviously this could n't be linked to ukranian neonazis right ? 
  it 's 900km away from crimea or donetsk . 
   aliens ? 
  by your logic putins dogs did n't poison litvinenko with radioactive shit in uk too , right ? 
  because how could they get there ? 
  yeah ... [ right ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_litvinenko#russian_criminal_investigation ), 
  totally . 
  russians went to ** western ** ukraine to blow up a monument . 
  tell me , do you believe in aliens visiting earth ? 
  we 're not the ones proclaiming ourselves to be the enlightened saviors of the world , are we ? 
  bravo . 
  it did n't take long to blame russia . 
  i mean , praising upa and all sort of hardcore ukrainian nationalists is totally not a thing in ukraine . 
  it 's all rt hoax , right ? 
  i saw it before in its entirety . 
  and this is why i 'm asking you to support your statements with solid evidence . 
  it 's not hard , is n't it ... ? 
  again .

  ok wiseguy , got any credentials to back up that smugness ? 
  hippie jargon my ass , people were systematically killed off in these countries for us strategic interests , an entire generation of argentinians ' status is still unresolved because of the dirty war , and the regime initiated the falklands war , was that really the end that the means justified ? 
   however quite often it 's not latin america they are criticized about , it 's the middle east by who , redditors ? 
  you made a blanket statement that everyone that criticizes the us is unintelligent , which is just your baltic kissassing to your security guarantee . 
  just because you have a good time under their wing did n't mean others did as well , and vice-versa for the ussr  vietnam was the same ah so the persecution of buddhists by a catholic dictator was clearly all about kicking out the soviets , sure . 
  [ chile ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_chilean_coup_d%27\u00e9tat ) [ guatemala ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_guatemalan_coup_d%27\u00e9tat ) [ nicaragua ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicaraguan_revolution ) [ el salvador ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salvadoran_civil_war ) [ operation condor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_condor ) [ the banana wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banana_wars ) and that 's only latin america , heading to asia we have * the united states backing pakistan [ in its brutal war against bangladeshi independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bangladesh_liberation_war ) , the only reason the indians were able to help was because the ussr sent submarines against the us fleet in the area * support for ngo dinh diem in south vietnam * tacit support for the khmer rouge against a soviet-aligned vietnam * support for suharto 's [ new order ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_order_ ( indonesia \\ ) ) in indonesia, 
   and most people hating on america just are far too unintelligent . 
  tell that to the people that had to deal with their juntas , i 'm * suure * they 'll see it the same way, 
  yea i should 've known better, 
  not really menacing , who does n't like barrel rolls ? 
  harvard boys were too busy fucking up the country , russia back then was also pretty trusting of america , so they had our undivided attention . 
  us actions and endorsements screwed any potential for any kind of us-russian alliance, 
  yo fuck off , russian food is delicious . 
  who are you to talk about what we do or do n't like , your ass ca n't speak for me or any other russian, 
  grandfather was a cleaner , he gets preferential treatment in all state buildings like museums and concert halls, 
  and what ? 
  chinese people will suddenly be flowing in ? 
  into a region that gives nothing of value to china ? 
  use your head, 
  literally the stupidest parallel to be made , considering how crimea was russian even while it was under ukrainian state control , whereas the russian far east has neither a significant chinese population , but also no historical control by either the prc or the roc that preceded it . 
  what is with this weird fetish you people have for mythical support for the prc in the russian far east ? 
  neither ethnic russians nor the mongols and turkic peoples living there want to have anything to do with the prc, 
  pretty sure yea , ren tv imo was always just a pretty silly channel , they 're one of the few that show softcore porn after midnight , it is n't a news channel , it 's an entertainment channel, 
   ren tv  respectable \u0425\u0410\u0425\u0410\u0425\u0410\u0425\u0410\u0425\u0410\u0425\u0410 that 's a good one, 
  in kalmykia , it 's very much a national symbol , but either way it 's unlikely that he will be imprisoned for long , right now he is in pre-trial detention, 
  but this is n't exactly imposition either , they are n't converting himto buddhism . 
  he is being punished for desecrating a national symbol, 
  yet it was still predominantly roman-catholic, 
  so as an example , would you have preferred poland be completely divided between a german-speaking protestant west and a russian-speaking orthodox east after the partitions ? 
  because buddhism in russia is specifically tied to the cultures of the kalmyk , buryat , and tuvan people , who have started to rehabilitate their culture after long years of religious suppression by the state . 
  the dagestani was in kalmykia and desecrated something very important for kalmyks as a people , and the people responded, 
  allegedly , the survey is still out , but there is a strong case for jewish russian and kalmyk, 
  if you read the history of the conflict , you 'll know that there is more nuance to south ossetia , in that the first conflict ended with multilateral peacekeeping, 
  they attempted to become an assr , which as you know is subnational, 
  well schedule of stay can be basic , my trip there was pretty ad hoc and was n't really planned too much , and i did n't have any issues . 
  and yes you need to tell duration of visit for obvious reasons , my visa lasted for only 2 weeks iirc ( i already had a passport replacement since then ), 
  that 's understandable , but it should n't come to a surprise that these people would want to politically separate what they view as their land , especially at an opportune moment like the dissolution of the ussr, 
   dagestani officials [ it was the head ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apbvw0xye2o ) , he looks so uncomfortable standing next to orlov, 
   why does someone has a right to cleanse a region of georgian population and `` self-determine '' at the expense of georgian state and people , taking away our lands ? 
  because georgians were also involved in ethnic cleansing , or did you somehow forget about the shitshow that was the georgian civil war ? 
  a country can exist without recognition , or is taiwan and somaliland a myth ? 
  that 's only when it 's just a c instead of a ch, 
  i had a japanese visa and i do n't really think they needed the daily routine , just contact info , hotel reservation , proof of ability to support yourself , stuff like that, 
   the reason there are no good opposition parties in russia is because of putin . 
  oh please , and how does putin do it , read their mind and have him arrested ? 
  you 're making this out into north korea , which is absolutely dishonest . 
  i 'm saying sometime in the future there is potential for new faces to bring change , as the economy develops and diversifies further , but in the current political climate i do n't expect anyone , because out of everyone who gained power from the soviet collapse , putin really is better than the oligarchs and their puppets . 
  putin is `` our own '' , he worked for security services and established relationships with the economically-liberal lawyers of st. petersburg , not to mention his policy of focusing on the maintenance of a multicultural society rather than just going `` rossiya for russkikh '' like navalny and his ilk, 
  there was plenty of opportunity for someone to arise in 13 years , but nobody did . 
  nemtsov was already corrupt back then , and the oligarchs were siphoning as much of the country as possible, 
  honestly i think any presidential candidate not already associated with some power would have probably been wacked by an oligarch, 
  i never said he could , but it 's not like putin can do anything either . 
  and just because your limited view thinks that putin forces the opposition look so stupid , does n't mean that is the reality . 
  the reality is that people like kasparov and navalny are the opposition , and they are both pretty unlikeable . 
  either way , putin still has his critics , from all political sides . 
  you have a very skewed view of who putin represents politics-wise in russian society . 
  russia belongs to putin not by much more than the us belongs to obama or china to xi . 
  it 's ridiculous to not expect that the job of leading a large and powerful country having pretty serious perks , the only difference is that the economic classes in russia only arose 20 years ago in a very chaotic state . 
  either way russia still very much belongs to russians , you want to see an example of what you are projecting , look at turkmenistan, 
  i 've been over this already a lot , the increase in oil prices would n't mean shit if he did n't bring the resources back under actual state control , and the prices alone did not help restore law in order in a country where people were being killed off in their driveways daily , not to mention his steadfast foreign policy, 
  not equally , putin * is * the improvement over yeltsin , and general consensus is that as of right now , he is still the better choice inb4 `` brainwashed russian '', 
  yea , people think that if we had the glorious opposition in power we would n't have these levels of high-end corruption , which is pretty silly, 
  i do n't really think i even care , considering the fact that it 's being described as a sanctions-evading measure . 
  this does more damage to western countries by simple virtue that this is more or less their domains of influence running these side-shows, 
  northern ireland speaks the same language as the uk in total , flanders and wallonia do not, 
  [ they 're not denying it ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/lifestyle/the-moscow-times-ukraine-bans-russian-films-for-distorting-historical-facts-358380.html ), 
  this conflict arose before either was independent , so international treaties are a shit reason,

   look at the red lines to the left of this box ? 
  the red lines are so you do n't get lost in the file hierarchy , it helps keep track of who replied to who  the inbox icon is hard to see . 
  the div that that 's in seems too thick or somehow strange . 
  yea the icon color choice was a mistake , the width however is weird because i triese to get it to play along with vanilla reddit and res  the constant scrolling images seem to turn the fan on in my computer i agree , it 's a bit of a useless feature  the image on the right is overlapping text .

  this is why places like / r/europe and / r/russia are horrible places to discuss anything to do with russia , because both subs have a bunch of circlejerkers that just spew shit all day , nuance is absolutely dead here and there,

  you do realize in your scenario , you will be nuked to shit right ? 
  [ oh please ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/vladimirputin ) , outside syria the independent very much makes digs at putin, 
  it 's very much pro the russian position , because the joint russian-syrian-iranian position in syria is making significant progress on the ground . 
  if the independent wishes to be respected as a publication , it needs to accept the reality on the ground , there is n't really much of an angle the editorial can push to take a jab at the kremlin . 
  [ it 's essentially vyshivanka , even if english wikipedia calls it only ukrainian ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a1%d0%bb%d0%b0%d0%b2%d1%8f%d0%bd%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b0%d1%8f_%d0%b2%d1%8b%d1%88%d0%b8%d0%b2%d0%ba%d0%b0 ), 
  yep , that guy 's talking out of his ass, 
  said russian oligarch was exiled ( from political power ) and has used his ownership of the independent to attack putin , so your argument falls flat here, 
  on a serious note : not enough of an effort into reconstruction .

  does surrogacy get both genetics or only one ?

  ten walls certainly did a number though, 
  and just how exactly are they able to do that without either an egg and a sperm ? 
  you forgot the organ harvesting, 
  the difference in syria is that they did n't bog down , are still keeping a presence , and secured a ceasefire with the local partner staying strong , which is completely different than afghanistan and vietnam,

  i wonder if we 'll experience a shift in a few decades just as english did . 
   was katyn a part of crating this buffer zone ? 
  no , that 's the part that i said was terrible and evil . 
  i do n't believe you actually read my post , so why do you feel that i should be obligated to even reply to you if you do n't bother reading my replies ? 
  for reference , a quote from my comment that you replied to :  i 'm not getting around it . 
  it was a terrible thing . 
  i 'm not justifying it , though it may sound so . 
  i 'm only saying that it was the least bad choice ussr or any other country in its place would have made . 
  does n't mean that it is n't evil . 
  it is . 
  what was more evil was how stalin repressed those nations once he took control of them . 
  however , the molotov ribbentrop pact is n't some sort of a satanic pact that makes ussr responsible for war . 
  it is a pact that any country would have made in the place of ussr . 
  stalin did n't want the polish military , he had no faith in it . 
  he knew poles would n't cooperate after being invaded . 
  so he disposed of anyone who was smart enough to oppose him in a dangerous way , thus the slaughter of the officers . 
  cut off the head and the chicken flops around . 
  yes , that 's why stalin was a brutal and evil dictator . 
  not defending him . 
  however , you 're wrong here :  one would think having a solid military between yourself and your enemy would be a better buffer than partaking in dismantling the buffer state and murdering its military officers , which meant wiping out the educated class , creating a border with the country you 're allegedly trying to defend yourself from . 
  that reaks of your own imperial ambitions , not defensive ones . 
  i do n't understand in what world you live in , but a proud country with a strong and rich national identity that was just occupied is n't gon na help the occupier . 
  what stalin did was to brutally pacify the country in the only way he knew . 
  once occupied , poland was guaranteed to resist , so he cut off the heads of potential leaders . 
  a logical step , but a brutal one . 
  the only way to avoid it would have been not to invade poland . 
  which was the morally correct choice of course , but stalin was n't interested in morals . 
  he was interested only in what benefitted his geopolitical situation the most . 
   ussr had a buffer against germany and molotov-ribbentrop destroyed it . 
  poland was no buffer , read some declassified archives of the politburo . 
  they expected poland to crumple right away should hitler invade . 
  joint forces of uk and france crumpled quite fast , you think poland would have done better instead of worse ? 
  stalin made a major blunder , he did not expect hitler to invade ussr right after ussr took that part of poland . 
  in that , you 're right , stalin would have been better off leaving poland as it was than invading it but only * if * hitler declared war on ussr and poland at the same time . 
  if hitler invaded poland and took it , then waited for a year and invaded ussr , ussr would unprepared . 
  so in short , stalin needed a pact that would have allied him with uk , france and poland , thus forcing hitler to declare war on all four at once . 
  i 'm not sure why you have n't done so already , but you 're free to google for politburo 's attempts to secure a military pact with france and uk . 
  i do n't come from a deterministic point of view . 
  i come from an educated one . 
  i majored in history in a us university . 
  first loyno , then vcu . 
  antiquities was my focus , but i took quite a few upper level modern history classes as well . 
  wwii was inevitable once hitler took power . 
  everything hitler did was to prepare germany for war . 
  the guy was obsessed with waging war on europe . 
  it is stunning to me that you could be so ignorant of the motives of one of the most evil men of the 20th century . 
  i can understand ignorance about stalin , he was a more secretive and complex man of evil . 
  however , hitler had written manifestos , diaries , personal speeches , private recorded conversations , plans , etc. 
  he has been studied ad nauseum in history . 
  we know his plans . 
  they were to conquer europe and eliminate pretty much all slavs save for a portion that was to remain as slaves until aryans bred enough to replace them . 
  molotov ribbentrop was a cynical result of the ussr 's partial awareness of hitler 's plans . 
  ussr knew hitler would take all of eastern europe up to the soviet borders . 
  the choice was to have hitler right on the border or to get a free buffer zone . 
  are you being intentionally misleading by implying that ussr should have simply let hitler grab all that land because of some conceited 21st century viewpoint of some moralist or do you actually believe that ? 
  what choice do you think any other country in the place of ussr would have made ? 
  hitler wanted war and the pact was just a temporary time-buying device . 
  stalin was wrong however in his incorrect estimate of how much time it would buy . 
  i 'm not getting around it . 
  it was a terrible thing . 
  i 'm not justifying it , though it may sound so . 
  i 'm only saying that it was the least bad choice ussr or any other country in its place would have made . 
  does n't mean that it is n't evil . 
  it is . 
  what was more evil was how stalin repressed those nations once he took control of them . 
  however , the molotov ribbentrop pact is n't some sort of a satanic pact that makes ussr responsible for war . 
  it is a pact that any country would have made in the place of ussr . 
  if you have the time you can read about politburo 's efforts to secure a pact with france and uk . 
  which failed . 
  ussr was a pariah state from day one , invaded by the west during the civil war to uphold the monarchy which kept us feudal . 
  but even a pariah state needs to make some agreements with its neighbors , if the west was n't going to guarantee joining ussr in a war against hitler then ussr would have to buy time to prepare for the war alone . 
  uk had the channel , that was its buffer . 
  france * wished * it had buffers , but they had to make do taking alsace and lorraine as well as creating the maginot line whilst depending on belgium and netherlands to serve as speed bump buffers . 
  sweden was a minor power , now you 're just arguing in bad faith , being intentionally dense . 
  if you wish to see how touchy nations get when their own buffers are violated , check out us in cuba . 
  after us placed offensive missiles in turkey it flipped when ussr put some in cuba , that only recently survived an invasion . 
  powerful nations tend to do this all the time , because they can . 
  this is n't a justification , it is a statement of fact . 
  historians do n't write history by framing each geopolitical ction of a historical power in moral terms . 
  keep in mind i am talking about wwii history here , not modern day which is a somewhat different situation , where nato is nowhere comparable to nazi germany . 
  historically big countries divide small countries , have you never picked up a history book ? 
  no big country with power in history has ever stayed polite and peaceful , that is n't how it works . 
  especially when you 're in a shit situation and you are expecting a major war soon , this necessitating carving out buffer zones to protect your proper . 
  one of the main reasons for the failure of ussr to get the military pact with france and uk was that the latter two were still deluded enough to believe that war could be prevented . 
  they miscalculated hitler . 
  they knew his plans , sure , he wrote of them in mein kampf , but they believed he would go east and take poland , then ussr . 
  ussr knew this too , which is why it wanted a strong military pact that would ensure an attack on both fronts of germany . 
  poland also wanted a strong military pact and it had it , except that uk and france were perfectly content wiping their arse with that agreement in gopes hitler would n't touch them and stalin was perfectly content wiping his arse with poland 's sovereignty because the politburo had no faith in poland being able to stand up to wehrmacht . 
  you can act sanctimonious all you want from your high moral pulpit or you can accept the reality of the brutal state of 1930s euro geopolitics . 
  swallow others or be swallowed . 
  now , putin is a different case . 
  he 's bullshitting hard . 
  but when this sub starts to downvote historical realities in their blind hatred of anyone russian even when the russian is n't a putinbot is when i simply laugh and understand that we 're all the same really , people are equally dumb in all countries . 
  russia is swimming in propaganda while eu has free media but it 's ok because people manage to be equally ignorant in both places . 
  why is it that after 70 years of scholarship this bullshit is still trotted out ? 
  if you 're a country that has a first choice of having an expansionistic nazi regime right next to you or having the second choice of a buffer zone , what do you pick ? 
  second one of course . 
  especially since the world was a crazy place in 1938 and a war was brewing ? 
  your modern bias is evident here , 1938 was a scary time , not peaceful like our days . 
  countries and regimes could disappear in a blink back then .

footage of the new ukrainian `` national guard '' out on maneuvers ? 
  seriously , which movie is this from ? 
  it looks like a battle scene where cossacks are fighting pollacks ( red and white flag in there ) . 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  ukrainians should stop hating russians and start hating pollacks again . 
  we will help you destroy those catholic degenerates once and for all . 
  well , you obviously changed it . 
  if you can manage being the only black guy in ukraine , you can manage that . 
  you can not separate russia from its god-anointed emperor . 
  i do n't think that you watch ukrainian news . 
  two small recent examples of ukrainian propaganda at work : 1 . 
  a couple of days ago , ukrainian msm reported that their spetsnaz had recaptured two of the armored vehicles which were `` captured by the separatists '' earlier . 
  two things false about this : a. 
  the vehicles were not `` captured '' , but were handed over by ukrainian soldiers who did n't want to fight their own people and have either switched sides or disbanded . 
  the glorious ukrainian spetsnaz never recaptured any of them , because the very next day the `` separatists '' paraded all six vehicles , still `` safely '' in their possession . 
  early last week , the ukranianian msm reported that their glorious army had `` fought off '' an `` armed separatist attack '' against their base in mariupol , killing one `` separatist '' , wounding three and capturing sixty . 
  in reality , multiple pieces video evidence shows that the ukrainian troops opened fire on a crowd of unarmed protesters who were gathered at the base 's gate . 
  they did n't even have sticks , much less firearms . 
  both pieces of propaganda was picked up by the western msm and reported in the same manner as the ukrainians reported it , without questioning . 
  they have also been caught producing many fake videos , such as the one where a `` russian colonel '' is instructing the `` separatists '' . 
  the colonel in the video was later identified as a two bit alcoholic actor . 
  also , every few days , an article from kiev post or somethings , supposedly once-and-for-all proving that the russians are controlling things on the ground in eastern ukraine , makes it to the top of / r/worldnews they have all been subsequently discredited . 
  any way , the point is , the very same top western pr firms who won the propaganda war for tbilisi in 2008 , are currently spinning things for kiev . 
  russia is still terrible at propaganda compared to those spin-masters . 
   no , he did n't . 
  the person from belgo said exactly that . 
  you are right . 
  it 's not in this video though and i failed to remember it from the original broadcast . 
   no , you are lying . 
  this is the full broadcast on the official channel of rt. 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=lz1b8o9p0ts#t=7418 or maybe rt edited video to make putin weird as well ? 
  no lying . 
  i just remembered it differently . 
  however , it 's would n't have been out of repertoire for banderovtsy to do something like this . 
  in this case , just showing putin 's attempt at humor and not the rest of his perfectly reasonable and compassionate reply to the guy that did the trick of making him look bad . 
   this term originated from the ussr , when having a personal car was considered hubby . 
  edit : after the second thought , \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c ca n't be translated as `` auto enthusiast '' at all , \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c used there as amateur , non-professional , not as `` enthusiast '' . 
  if you are not a professional driver like taxi driver , etc. , you are \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c . 
  tl ; dr. you are full of shit . 
  yes , it is a very quaint soviet term and it personally makes me cringe a little and smile every time that i hear it used these days . 
  vladimir vladimirovich probably had the same reaction . 
  any way , i was wrong about several things in my post , but that does n't change the fact that this was putin 's attempt at `` kgb humor '' ( which was used several times during this call-in ) , that might seem callous to the westerners , but appears as perfectly innocent to me and every other russian , especially in the context of vladimir vladimirovich 's full reply and the fact that the guy is getting his road . 
  i might have been `` full out shit '' in my post , but the fact remains : this was a cheap attempt at smearing our leader posted by a ukrainian fascist . 
  that drunk guy was obviously a terrorist fsb operative . 
  no uproar when you talk about exterminating russians and your own russian-speaking population though . 
  awesome . 
  god forbid you mention `` federalism '' in a tv interview or the rightsec thugs will be waiting outside of the tv studio in order to beat the shit out of you . 
  in the glorious , free ukraine ... 
  `` sometimes people get sick and you ca n't even take them out of the village because the road is just terrible . '', 
  you made this part up . 
  also , this video is edited weird , like to make putin more `` callous '' , laughing in inappropriate places . 
  it 's not from the official broadcast . 
  the real thing was a lot more innocent and was clearly just an attempt at humor . 
  the guy did n't just say that he was a `` car owner '' . 
  he presented himself as a an `` auto enthusiast '' . 
  that 's what made it sound absurd and almost comical . 
  any way , nice job , kiev propaganda bot . 
  keeping scumming . 
  did you actually watch the `` propaganda show '' ? 
  most of it was uncomfortable questions about poor utility services , corruption , etc. 
  i am ex russian military and special forces . 
  when i saw the `` polite green men '' in crimea , i instantly recognized them as our guys - most likely professional ( contract ) paratroopers . 
  however , i do n't see any of ours in eastern ukraine . 
  sure , there are a few russian volunteers here and there , but there 's no russian military or spetsnaz on the ground . 
  i see a lot of former ukrainian military , lead by afghan war vets . 
  more moronic anti-russian propaganda . 
  growing by 1.3 % is considered shrinking now ?!? 
  yes . 
  the russian economy has slowed down after years of excellent growth , but you have to remember that russian per-capita gdp is way ahead of other brics as it is . 
  also , russia does n't even claim to be an `` assertive global power '' . 
  they were send there to develop these territories : teach at the universities , run science research labs , do skilled factory work , etc. 
  unlike the western imperialists , the soviet union did n't pursue a policy of forced russication . 
  children had to learn the russian language in schools , but every republic also got to keep their own language and cultural traditions . 
  it 's also ridiculous to compare these soviet `` settlers '' to those other ones , as they had no choice in the matter - you were sent to work in the baltics , western ukraine or ( god forbid ) one of the `` stans '' ( with kazakhstan being a notable exception ) . 
  yes . 
  they should be treated diffidently . 
  i 'm sick of people using those putin quotes out of context . 
  the catastrophe and tragedy that he 's talking about were nagorniy karabakh , ossetia , abkhazia , chechnya , georgian civil war , tajikistan civil war , etc. . . tens of thousands of people dead , hundreds of thousands of refugees , tens of millions of russians finding themselves living in foreign countries , families separated ... putin has no love for the soviet system and has repeatedly condemned it . 
  stop with the libel . 
  finns are funny little people . 
  you know what russians think about finland ? 
  we do n't . 
  however , if your little invasion fantasies and reminiscing about the good old days of mannerheim and white death make you feel better about your little selves , keep at it !, 
  poles really are ungrateful , vile people . 
  i avoid them at all costs , because whenever i see one , i get a strong desire to punch him out and i really do n't want to get in trouble with the law again . 
  you are a victim of years of constant `` blame everything on russia '' type of russophobic propaganda , but you will come around when the eu shows itself for what it really is - the fourth reich and begins to destroy your cultures . 
  we 'll have to come there and save your asses ungrateful assess from the blood-thirsty westerners ... again . 
  it is a rather empty gesture by a small bunch of ostracized malcontents . 
  you 'll still say goodbye to crimea tomorrow , bandera . 
  50,000 people in `` not '' massive for moscow ( a city of over 10,000,000 ) . 
  this is just a bunch of `` hipster '' opposition kiddies , protesting because it 's cool and hip . 
  typical moscovite elitist arrogance . 
  so , it 's a bunch of traitors ? 
  half of my family lives in crimea . 
  why do these people want them to continue living in an impoverished , not self-sustainable , clearly failed state that is ukraine , which is now ruled my a russophobic right-wing junta ?!? 
  by the way , big lol at the `` ukrainian army '' repelling anything . 
  they do n't really have a single combat-ready regiment and their troops are still equipped with soviet-afghan war era shit . 
  thanks , brothers . 
  wish that we could have done more for you in 1999 , but we had a leadership problem back then . 
  however , we will help you take kosovo back from the islamist terrorists yet and make those nato dogs pay for bombing your country too .

  the fuck are you talking about ? 
  vyborg is still a vibrant russian city and one of the most beautiful imo . 
   this is a first , a russian telling others they live in their own world ... :d you have lied your way through this entire conversation and have completely ignored most of the facts and rebuttals i have posted . 
  typical finnish behavior . 
  i do not think it is a coincidence that most of the finns i have met irl and on the internet are historical revisionists . 
   might be true but the families that stayed were mostly never to be heard of again . 
  like , you do n't have to leave but if you do n't ... 
  i 'm living proof that shows that you what said is a load of bs . 
  my great-grandmother was a karelian who stayed happily with her russian husband and karelian-vepsian family . 
  hes not wrong we are always here always watching always downvoting your posts always asking for proofs there is no escape now if you will excuse me , i have to go talk to my manager about a raise . 
  i 'm sitting here for hours upon hours developing carpal tunnel syndrome and i 'm getting paid chump change for each post . 
  unfortunately , hes from mars and only speaks judeo-lizard . 
  so i will need a translator . . again . 
  oh and a tinfoil hat to protect me from his telepathic radioactive mind-control powers . 
  ( which is generated by american chemtrails ), 
   decided to risk their lives to save jews . 
  yea , that was what ww2 was about . 
  totally had nothing to do with preventing the extermination/enslavement of half of europe and the destruction of european civilizations . 
  you do know pretty much no one cared about what was happening to jews , especially in the uk and us . 
  a lot of people even refused to believe the holocaust happened shortly after the war and during the war the allied governments did n't have a full picture of what was going on . 
  you are saying they were needless . 
  from whose perspective ? 
  do you know anything about ww2 ? 
   poland this has a lot to do with the polish-soviet war and polish attempts to expand their borders as far as possible between germany and the soviet union . 
  the liberation of soviet nationalities living in the polish borderlands was also part of the reason why stalin decided to invade alongside the germans . 
  however , the most significant reason why he decided to invade poland was to create breathing room for the soviet union in the case of german invasion . 
  so , it was not `` needless '' . 
   finland very similar to what happened with poland . 
  leningrad ( st petersburg ) was very close to foreign countries that were hostile to communism . 
  this was the second most significant city in all the soviet union . 
  capturing the karelian isthmus and karelia ladoga would have provided sufficient defense of leningrad in case of attack from the north communist internationalism also had a big role to play in the motivation to invade those states , but when it came down to it all that was really just soviet rhetoric . 
  we do not invade countries for no reason , as if we have some barbaric dna or something that compels us to do so . 
  get your head out of your ass . 
   ukraine not even going there . 
  what the fuck are you even talking about ? 
  this is probably the 16th time i 've seen this argument come out of this subreddit - the idea that we invade countries purely out of tradition . 
  really funny . 
  what does ukraine or the cold war ( we started that ? 
  lmao ) have to do with this ? 
  you are now bringing up irrelevant topics in order to divert the conversation to an area where you think you have the high ground . 
  really pathetic . 
  the winter war ended with the moscow peace treaty . 
  violating peace treaties , invading territory that was never part of their state , and attempting to commit ethnic cleansing - but hey , finland did nothing wrong . 
  oh , so its our fault that finland decided to cleanse karelia of russian people ? 
  good to know . 
  lets get something clear - you use the word soviet . 
  yes , these people were soviet citizens . 
  however , they were not targeted because they were soviet . 
  they were targeted because they were slavic/russian and not finnic . 
   you also showed maps of finnish karelia taken over by ussr . 
  no , i fucking showed you a map of the territories held by finland before and during the winter war and a map showing the territory of the soviet union which was occupied by finland during the continuation war . 
  the maps clearly show that the majority of the territory finland occupied was never part of the country . 
  `` not comparable to our suffering '' the vast majority of finnic people who left karelia left willing or were forced by the finnish government . 
  the treaty that ceded those territories did not require any relocation of populations . 
  either you stop being a muppet or stop replying to my posts . 
  you obviously live in your own fucking world . 
  we all got something to worry over . 
  you guys have vietnamese communist sleeper-cells in soup shops in warsaw . 
  i just showed you maps of areas finland seized and tried to cleanse and were never part of finland . 
   the east karelian camps are the same as the pows camps . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_prisoners_of_war_in_finland#winter_war [ no they are not ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_karelian_concentration_camps ) . 
  men , women , and children - anyone of slavic ethnicity ( mainly russian ) were confined to camps by the finnish military administration . 
  my grandfather was just a child and was confined behind those fences with my family . 
  m  and the mortality rate was not due to execution like the soviet union , it was due to famine and disease . 
  the purpose of the detention was allegedly to secure the area behind the front lines against partisan attacks . 
  and through the course of the detention camps unlike the soviet camps finland actually let alot of them go when they judged areas to be clear of partisan attacks . 
  what is this bullshit you just typed up ? 
  the only reason why those people died of disease and starvation was because they were confined to fucking concentration camps and mistreated . 
  the karelian camps were part of a fucking ethnic cleansing operation , what in the actual fuck are you talking about ? 
  are regularly whippings and beatings normal to you ? 
  my great-grandfather was whipped , severely beaten , and thrown into a pond by finnish soldiers . 
  my great-grandmother , a russophone karelian , had to pull him out . 
  he died of starvation while interned . 
  all written down in my grandfather 's journal . 
   i would argue the detention camps were justifiable . 
  of course the deaths that occurred due to famine and disease were not and are a sad fact . 
  finland became increasing a target for partisan attacks from the soviets . 
  go fuck yourself . 
  those partisan attacks that you poor-little finnish victims had to endure were a direct result of the ethnic discrimination in the occupied parts of russia and internment of russian civilians . 
   soviet union took over finnish areas , naturally occupied by finns , not vice versa . 
  there was no `` finnish occupation '' , just finns living in finland , before the soviets stole the land . 
  finland ceded those territories ( ladoga karelia ) to russia after you guys lost the war . 
  re-invading it and taking the land and more of east karelia is occupation . 
  east karelia has been inhabitated by russians as well since the novgorod republic and several wars were fought over it with sweden . 
  internment and concentration camps are synonymous . 
  one is pejorative term and the other one is n't , but they are more or less the same thing . 
  go ahead and deny all you want , live in ignorance like the americans who deny the existence and nature of the japanese internment camps . 
  ( which had far better living conditions and treatment ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_karelian_concentration_camps [ finnish territory that was fought over during winter war ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/winterwar-december1939-soviet-attacks.png ) [ territory occupied by finland during ww2 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/finnish_advance_in_karelia_during_the_continuation_war.png ), 
  you 're post is a combination of whataboutism and white-washing . 
  your country put people in concentration camps where they died , and you try to justify it by listing soviet crimes and `` we wuz here first '' claims . 
  i 'm talking about the east karelian camps , not pows which is another story . 
  25,000 russians were interned in camps during finnish occupation and 7,000 of them died including my great-grandfather . 
  ( starved ) you keep talking about the gulag as well , and link to it more than once . 
  why ? 
  you do know that solzhenitsyn is standard reading for russian school kids ? 
  how am i trolling ? 
  much better in russia than it ever was under finnish occupation . 
  i 'm sure most of the elderly who experienced ww2 in the republic prefer their homes over the concentration camps finland had to offer . 
  edit : downvoting because i 'm pointing out inconvenient historical facts . 
  sad .

   a coup d'\u00e9tat , also known simply as a coup , or an overthrow , is the sudden and illegal seizure of a state , usually instigated by a small group of the existing government establishment to depose the established regime and replace it with a new ruling body . 
  a coup d'\u00e9tat is considered successful when the usurpers establish their dominance . 
  if a coup fails , a civil war may ensue . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coup_d%27%c3%a9tat )  also maidan was not a coup in any normal definition of the word . 
  maidan itself ( as in the peaceful meeting of people protesting against president ) was n't . 
  storming the government buildings and toppling the government , which was later replaced by people who already were a part of the government , was . 
  you might argue that it was closer to the [ revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolution ) than a coup , but i fail to see complete restructuring of the country that follows the revolution , and for all intents and purposes , for russia coup or revolution were the same beasts . 
  if russia would react to an unfavorable outcome  i simply reject as an absurd piece of propaganda that maidan was a `` coup '' or that good relations with post-maidan ukraine were impossible ( that is until crimea and the war in donbass ) . 
  your rejection nonwithstanding , good relations were possible , of course . 
  crimea is a very , very special case , which is really hard for foreigners to understand . 
  and even after crimea , if ukraine reacted to donbass separatism movement with negotiation ( like it actually did in odessa and kharkiv ) and not with tanks and helicopters , i 'm fairly sure the relations could 've been more amicable . 
  first 6 months neither the separatists nor the ukrainian army wanted to fight , and there was no sight of the mysterious russian reinforcements . 
  nowadays - yea , russia supports donbass , i have no doubt there are some special forces and a lot of russian military materiel there , but at first the seps were effectively alone . 
  of course the separatists ' absurd demands of complete separations were bullshit , but giving them at least limited self-governance that did n't allow secession would 've cooled a lot of hot heads - and instead they received artillery shelling of civilians . 
  but i digress . 
  the whole donbass situation is pretty nasty , especially after that plane that the separatists have downed . 
  but claiming that toppling of government as a result of maidan was lawful change of power is a complete delusion . 
  do you imply that any politician who is generally positive towards your country is deeply in your country 's pockets ? 
  russia reacted that way because he was still friendlier than new government , and because he was a legitimately voted president . 
  the elections were 6 months away , and he even agreed to conduct earlier elections - but maidan crowd somehow decided that waiting for 3 months is too long . 
  russia always viewed whatever happened in kiev after maidan as a coup , so that was their reaction . 
  and yes , yanukovich was more in favor of russia than the people coming after him . 
  most loud voices of maidan who subsequently filled the parliament were the remnants of the orange revolution ( like yulia ) or people having the same views . 
  but all of that does n't mean that he was a kremlin agent or bought by putin . 
  he was a ukrainian crook , stop shifting blame . 
   ukraine was in the hand of russia for decades under janukovic . 
  if yanukovich was so deep in russia 's pocket , ukraine would 've been in eurasian economic union ( putin 's pet project ) long time ago , along with belarus and kazakhstan . 
  yanukovich actively resisted that , trying to sit on two chairs , getting cooperation with both eu and russia at the same time . 
  if he was just a pawn , he 'd follow kremlin 's orders much , much more . 
  the only master yanukovich had was his own money . 
  he was a crook and a corrupt piece of shit , but he certainly was n't exclusively pro-russian , he was pro-yanukovich . 
  3 posts above :  the bear wanted the entirety of ukraine now :  i did n't say russia wanted to occupy the whole of ukraine . 
  you really did say that . 
  unless you meant some other ` bear ' . 
  i do n't support him , but thanks for your input , your frenzied point of view is appreciated . 
  i actually agree with this statement . 
  we ourselves do it all the time , and only brainfrozen guys like / u/psilokinesis have an issue with that . 
   go after his cronies and his money they did just that with sanctions . 
  did n't work . 
   instead of building new north streams , look for alternatives to russian gas and oil to embargo russia first , north stream is not only profiting russia , it 's profitable for eu . 
  noone likes to have the goods they paid for not appear just because some middleman decided he was n't paid enough , which is why this pipeline was initially created , to decrease the role of transit countries on the safety of the gas shipment . 
  second , the alternatives are scarce . 
  main alternative would be middle east , mostly saudi arabia . 
  i understand that ukrainians would rather fund the devil than russia , but i strongly suspect that not all eu people would like that . 
  being dependent on russia 's supply and dealing with it from time to time is much less problematic than being dependent on middle eastern supply and dealing with them . 
  remember the oil crisis of 1977-78 ? 
  saudis are in position to do much more damage to eu than russia ever will be upon the countries that rely on their fossil fuels . 
  so while i understand your intentions , it 's not that simple - and mostly it 's not that fast to implement all those changes . 
  it 's not enough to issue a trade embargo on russia and watch it collapse , because it will have a huge cost for eu itself , and why would they want to hurt themselves only to damage some bully ? 
   estonia has a very recent history of it 's own language taking precedence that was only supplanted at the behest of soviet bootheels . 
  this gives them a vested interest in maintaining the integrity of their country against a state which explicitly practiced cultural cleansing and mass deportation to ensure the subservience of it 's conquered people . 
  i completely understand that . 
  but the methods they chose to enforce that are akin to apartheid , and not really suitable for a modern enlightened democratic country . 
  that 's the difference . 
  do you really think if that exam is so easy as the baltics state , and if the people will learn it as a part of earning their citizenship , they would really speak it in day-to-day life ? 
  no , people will still speak english and russian . 
  this exam changes nothing for preserving the language , but it does irritate a lot of people . 
   the soviet occupation of the baltics began 70 years ago and involved intense and recent repression of the occupied nations culture , government and language . 
  occupation of the baltics was really mild in comparison to what brits did to ireland and scotland ( unlike the stalin repressions later ) . 
  there was no prolonged war , there were no constant rebellions - and there was no even equivalent to ira . 
  i also remind you that the baltics did n't suffer stalin for 50 years - after his death it was a pretty good place , generally better than the rest of ussr , without repressions or deportations or any other horrors . 
  yes , russification took place , and i do n't support it , but now they are doing baltification instead - simply said , they follow in the steps of the culture they hated so much . 
  and in the end the baltics also were let go non-violently , much like ireland you spoke of . 
  and seeking peaceful solutions does n't work if only one side does it . 
  there never was any intent , however distant , to rectify relations from the baltics , their whole external policy for the last 20 years was to distance themselves from russia as much as they can ( not that i blame them , but it 's not a friendly gesture , do n't you think ? ), 
  - why can russia maintain really amicable relations with , say , finland ( which we had wars with and which supported our arch-nemesis ) , armenia and khazakhstan , but not with the baltic states ? 
  because it takes two to dance tango . 
  of course , i do n't imply that russia was really forthcoming , but the intent of the baltics is crystal clear ; if they tried to mend relations , i 'm fairly sure they would 've been much better now . 
   if you refuse to accept estonia 's rights to do as it pleases because it opposes your politics but support 2 provinces in ukraine 's right to secession because they 're sponsored by the kremlin i do n't refuse to accept estonia 's rights `` to do as it pleases '' ( though i do n't see anything inherently bad about it - various countries always meddled in other countries ' affairs , just look at the clusterfuck in the middle east now , or british colonies before , or spanish colonies even earlier ) . 
  i do n't support it , but accept it - i simply highlight why it can be seen in such a negative light . 
  in my opinion , any immigrant must follow the rules of the country he/she lives in , however stupid those rules are - but that does n't mean that you should keep silent about that stipidity . 
  and actually i do n't support 2 provinces right to secession . 
  i think the whole donbass situation should 've been avoided - and it could 've been avoided like it was in kharkiv and odessa provinces , by simple negotiation . 
  though i still support , and will support secession of the crimea , because it was effectively stolen from russia ( not without our own president participation , of course ) in 1991 , and its pleas for even some level of auto-regulation were unheard for 20 years . 
  and northern ireland joined uk peacefully ? 
  or scotland ? 
  they were completely separate countries before britain bulged in , no difference apart from the age . 
  yet you support spreading english language . 
  is n't that incredibly disingenuous to simply sweep away your own conquest and denounce others ? 
  anyway , forcefully taken or not , the baltics were a part of ussr . 
  if you follow all the conquests , then western half of ukraine must not follow ukrainian rules and conform with ukrainization just because it used to be part of poland . 
   no , i said it 's understandable if you want to force your own citizens to speak a language , and not understandable if you want to force somebody else 's citizens to do so . 
   i 'm not sure what was confusing about `` russification was a problem for a number of reasons but principally because it was russia forcing it 's language and culture on other nations over which it held influence . 
  this is estonia forcing it 's citizens to learn an acceptable level of estonian . '', 
  estonians were soviet citizens , thus your point does n't make any sense . 
  if it is ok for estonia to demand knowledge of the official language from their citizens , it 's also ok for ussr to demand knowledge of the official language from their , is n't it ? 
  we 're not talking about russification of poland , which was never in ussr , we 're talking about one of 15 soviet republics . 
   it 's because russia was forcing it 's language , culture and entire system of government and doing things on another country . 
  again , it was not russia forcing another country . 
  it was ussr forcing its own citizens . 
  i actually agree with you that forcing the culture on people is bad , and i do n't understand why other countries do n't learn from our mistakes . 
  your other points also talk about how russia influenced other countries . 
  but ussr was a single federal country . 
  baltic states , ukraine , belarus , kazakhstan , armenia and others were akin to your wales , scotland and northern ireland , not countries outside your border . 
  i repeat , if we 'd talk about russification of poland , hungary , bulgaria or romania , i 'd agree that your point is correct . 
  but we 're not . 
  demanding language knowledge for certain positions is something i fully agree with - if you 're going to work with people , you damned better know the most widespread languages in the country . 
  see how canada has most of the job offers only for bilingual people . 
  demanding that you know a certain language just to vote for the government is another matter entirely . 
   russification was a problem ... because it was russia forcing it 's language and culture on other nations over which it held influence  i 'm in favour of stricter language requirements on immigrants to learn and practice an acceptable level of english .

  misunderstood and misinterpreted . 
  sincere or expressly ? 
  let me explain . 
  this was an ** open ** poll . 
  participants were asked to name ** any ten ** names of influential in history people that would come to their mind . 
  quickly !, 
  by phone , in a minute . 
  there was ** no list ** to choose from and/or to compare . 
  try yourself  what does it mean as you look at the results ? 
  only 38 % of voters mentioned ( and not necessarily at the first place ) stalin at all . 
  just remembered . 
  and just 38 % . 
  relaxed ? 
    your government goes crazy whenever someb i do not see it, 
   instead of making the lives of russian people better . 
  the joke is that we began to live better only after stopping to fulfill western advises and follow their politics . 
  grand-grand dad of my wife was a faithful soldier of the empire . 
   never in the history o why never ? 
  opposite . 
  almost ever . 
  but we used to . 
   short period while we have some rose hopes about it has ended . 
  the western world does not need an independent and strong russia . 
  may be , too scared ? 
  it is your right though . 
  no  just using the same common arguments . 
  if it looked this way - i have received my goal . 
  you know better , i 'm serious . 
   stop playing the victim . 
  that is it !, 
  we are the only who do not  too proud , may be . 
  everybody like to have a scapegoat to blame  and here we are - very handy for half of europe . 
   latvian rifleman regiment suppressed anti-soviet uprising in moscow . 
  dzerzhinsky was polac , stalin was georgian , kruschev ukranian . 
  and nobody is allowed to speak of a role in revolution of some unmentionable nation . 
  baltics are counting their people that were send to gulag as if they were send there for their nationality . 
  completely forgetting to compare the number of russians already there . 
  and nobody in east eur . 
  is remembering their own communists . 
   the latin alphabet is not well suited to slavic languages exactly . 
  ( or should use 4 letters instead of one , like in polish , 
  western ( and our opposition ) media makes a big fuss about it , but no . 
   russians suffered more and for longer time during communism ? 
  exactly . 
  but common opinon - to blame not communists , but russians . 
   and also refused to fight the russians , the americans or the british . 
  they declared the war to us and uk . 
  was bombed by allies . 
  but - true - did not declare the war to the ussr . 
  really ? 
  i bet that we had much more children suffering the same way . 
  and for much more time . 
  btw grand-grand dad of my wife was killed at plevna . 
  voluntereed . 
  we use their alphabet . 
   suffered from them in another when ? 
  good for you . 
  you mean , that you have not closed your ignalinos atomin\u0117 elektrin\u0117 , losing energy independence for joining eu ? 
  and similar ... 
  the difference ( from now ) is that with yeltsin russia really gave up . 
  russia was giving everything trying to be liked . 
  all in vain . 
  ( look at kozyrev , foreign minister of russia under yeltsin . 
  mister ` yes ' . 
  sold all for nothing , have not received anything . 
  now lives in miami - surprise ! ), 
  point me the russian hitler everybody here is so concerned . 
  yes . 
   second point is visible in the op . 
  billboards like that are forcing . 
  the thing is - i , living in moscow have a chance to see such poster and stuff - only here . 
  but majority in reddit sincerely think that they now better ( sure , due to the immaculate western media , 
  the question is - why everybody has the right to be himself . 
  french - being french , american - being american , and so on . 
  but russians ? 
  not for them . 
  never . 
  they owe everybody , as i can see here also . 
  yes . 
  he became named czar in 1947 . 
  and before that he was grand duke of grand duchy of moscow . 
  and would we say that just renaming means new state ? 
  we tried . 
  unfortunately . 
  during yeltsin . 
  thank you , no more . 
  it just became obvious - that never russia would be liked . 
  unless disappeared . 
  that is the point . 
  your opponent have lost two times - first , when after you have pointed him the sources - and he more then ignored them , second , when he insulted . 
  ps have you seen ` niekas nenor\u0117jo mirti ' with great donatas banionis ? 
   something nice about russia but such would be politically incorrect !, 
  thank god !, 
   nothing new just russia being russia damn right !, 
  and why russia should want to be not/less russian ? 
  yes !, 
  and no ukraine at all , 
  support for navalny hear is marginal . 
   does this battle even hold a prominent place in the russian psyche  no . 
  they have been forcing it for the past couple of years , no .

   ppp is useless when comparing two different economies to each other . 
  are you insane ? 
  economy is not the number of empty digits on your pc screen , economy is real stuff you can afford/buy/produce / etc. 
  for those numbers , using those numbers - that 's exactly what ppp is : `` purchase power '' . 
  nominal . 
  ppp matters . 
  and all those recent reports of `` 39 % being in grey economy '' ( which are really ridiculous , as up to 300 % are there ) , etc. 
  haha , why, 
  you probably tried to completely ignore the article , otherwise would notice :  `` the really devastating news for ` our western partners ' ( as putin likes to refer to them ) must be -- which we are the first to report -- the extraordinary decrease in the share of oil & gas revenue in russia 's gdp . '', 
  :d omg , they are like having a party there, 
  not so soon . 
  ca n't you read english ( are you an ukrainian immigrant in the uk ) ? 
  playing a fool has never been a good answer or generally a good option in life . 
  i have asked : how do you know it 's ukraine ( read - that crimea is allegedly a part of ukraine ) ? 
  have you ever been to there yourself or you are living in some lost media/papers ` reality ' which does n't coincide with objective reality and that 's why so often called like `` fake stuff '' ? 
  have you been to there ? 
  how do you know it 's ukraine ? 
  eternity ... sounds sweet !, 
  check this and all the other albums there vk.com/album-101373101_220631836 , get `` deeper '' a bit , so to speak . 
   making a picture of a person she does n't like why is this assumption ? 
  obviously it 's on the contrary , she `` likes '' him or whatever . 
  it is populated by ca . 
  2 mln . 
  people . 
  people are n't really a thing `` to steal '' or whatever like that , if someone does n't have your way of thinking , of course . 
  you are n't used to bear responsibility for your random fake words , i understand it well , but nevertheless , would n't you be afraid to ever say this to any of those people right there - to be like a man , reasoning you know , coming to the `` stolen '' place and `` rescuing '' it like `` hey , guys , did you know you are stolen ? 
  this your peninsula is stolen ? 
  i found this stolen thing here , i am going to bring it back to its owner '' or all you can do is to type fake empty words which are worth literally nothing , not making any slightest sense ?

  a memorandum is signed !, 
   the truth is , we do n't care about you at all , russia is very rarely in then news in estonia . 
  that 's why all you generally do ( and you generally do n't do a lot , here i agree ) is `` complaining about bad russia threat '' and thus `` begging for more subsidies '' and stuff ? 
  poland , hello !, 
  why are you so angry making me report you , did n't trump inspire you ?

  singling them out as `` migrants '' , `` temporary residents '' , `` permanent residents '' whatever else but never as citizens , who can vote and have all the rights/duties/obligations a country grants , and who make up a `` population '' which generally matters as a population of a country for this country , - not as a patient in a nusring home and for a department that hires migrant workers to be nurses . 
  stay a nurse , man !, 
  i feel no hope there , even for a good education changing anything there as it 's either too late or just impossible in principle . 
  `` butthurt '' ?!, 
  you just try to read what you are writting ( \u261e \uff9f \u2200 \uff9f ) \u261e !, 
  :d i of course understand that `` making sense '' has never been among estonian priorities ( unlike being `` so sensitive '' and `` getting so offended '' , also `` playing an eternal victim '' in a bid for some eternal subsidies ) , but oh , well , i am not an estonian . 
  meybe because it 's not 2015 , 2014 and even not 2013 ( but in fact 2011 , 2012 , 2013 ) - the gruesome ukranian years , heh , a steady decline - but 2017 , instead ?

  ask europe : how is it generally called in the eu - `` bad corruption '' or `` good lobbying and stuff '' to be counted in good statistics ? 
  it 's hard to understand what `` real life '' of an estonian in a permanent search for jobs in finland is , sorry . 
  usually people count the ones able to vote in the legal sense of the word and who generally has all the rights to say : `` it 's my country , i am the man of this country ! '' . 
  what trifling matter of internal management is , is interesting only for certain accountants in a nursing home . 
  you really make no sense . 
  i am not really interested in a discussion for the sake of discussion , and must acknowledge you as a not-interesting-interlocutor and hence leave you . 
  low energy !, 
  vagueness !, 
  nonsense . 
  i have no idea , obviously something similar to what is in front of/opposite to it :d, 
  `` fewer '' , what ? 
  it 's the increase of population which came out of `` change in the calculation methodology '' obviously starting to calculate not citizens but whoever and for whatever reasons came to the country and is `` living in '' . 
  please , educate yourself , and let me , mister democratic estonian , trust to and rely on the world bank more than on the estonia statistics , who also admits itself : ** the increase in the population figure was also influenced by changes in the calculation methodology **, 
  they do , for domestic `` use '' ( mainly economical , managing social and work stuff ) . 
  but when speaking of `` population '' in general : `` what 's the population of that or this country ? '', 
  - they count citizens . 
  who among any more-or-less significant entities except this wiki-aricle and estonia statistics seeking to make it look nice does operate it in that way ? 
  yes . 
  astrakhan oblast , mistyped there a bit , in english it 's `` astrakhan '' . 
   population is usually counted with people living in the country , not citizens , `` usually in estonia '' , as usual . 
  got you , little mister . 
  thanks !, 
  the world is used to do it in the other way though - exactly by the number of citizens and counting the `` migrants '' , etc. 
  `` living/working '' singled out in a separate category . 
   see people , this is a golden example of a brainwashed person !, 
  really , you speak like a worst communist agitator , mister , haha . 
  better if you learned and loaned nukes and spaceships from the ussr instead of that . 
  this you mean :  in 2015 the country experienced population growth . 
  the population mainly increased as a result of net immigration of european union citizens . 
  ... with the reference : [ `` the population increase was influenced by external migration '' ] ( https://www.stat.ee/277564 ) . 
  4 may 2016 . 
  statistics estonia . 
  retrieved 14 june 2016 ? 
   the population figure decreased by 1,336 persons due to negative natural increase , but increased by 2,410 as a result of positive net migration . 
  the increase in the population figure was also influenced by changes in the calculation methodology , resulting in 1,599 persons being added to the population . 
  a methodology trick , most lickely . 
  like counted `` migrants '' and `` retired pensioners '' from the eu as `` living in '' to make it look nice , while `` population '' is usually counted by the number of citizens of a country . 
  otherwise russia 's population , for instance , would be of a ** vague ** figures like between 155 to 185 mln . 
  ( more ? ),

  same with cargo trains filled with cheap ukrainian stuff that people buy when they have no other choice . 
  it 's too bad that ukraine decided against introducing visas for russians , meaning that our government wo n't introduce visas for them either . 
  `` donbass war veterans '' . 
  i thought it 's a counter-terrorist operation , not a war !, 
  considering this entire clusterfuck started with eu disregarding russia utterly and completely , moving further down the same path can only end well . 
  you do realize that what 's going on is that eu tried to snatch a huge market of 40 million people under russias nose knowing well that russian trade standards and rules are fundamentally incompatible with those of eaa , right ? 
  wait wait wait ... 
  i though all of the russian tv is fake . 
  why do you suddenly believe it ? 
  also , still no answer whose tanks ?

  what did you expect them to say ? 
  `` thank you '' ? 
   use google - there are a lot of photos . 
  if there are so many of them . 
  post a few here . 
  because `` use google '' is n't an argument . 
  you make an accusation , it 's your job to support it . 
  also `` i only posted a link '' is not an excuse either as you 're clearly engaging the opposing view in the comments . 
   dnr lnr has 700 tanks - it is more than germany . 
  source ? 
  also whos tanks ? 
  [ ukraine had 6500 tanks at it 's disposal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armed_forces_of_ukraine ) after the fall of ussr . 
  exactly what my post says . 
  avdyivka is almost 100km deep in the ukrainian territory . 
  i see a destroyed city filled with ukrainian military personnel . 
  where are the pictures of the russian units marching through the country pillaging all on their path . 
  it 's not about the crimea annexation it 's about `` oppression and genocide of tatars and ukrainians '' . 
  therefore , comparison to kosovo is actually very relevant . 
  some russian actors will be found guilty on all accounts while those on the ukrainian side will be whitewashed or ignored . 
  because shelling a civilian city is only bad when russia does it , even when there is no evidence to support the claim russian troops did it in the first place . 
  can we finally see those advancing russian troops ? 
  i mean there are so many of them they leveled a city . 
  would be nice to see the actual troops marching towards it as well !, 
  moar fearmongering , need moar fearmongering !, 
  fun stuff , i have n't heard a thing about `` russia being outraged '' about this in the local media . 
  in fact this ukrainian , totally legitimate news source , is the first place from where i heard about this development . 
  go on ... how is it oppression ? 
  edit : heh . 
  ok , i guess downvotes tell me that prime-time tv ass humping ban is anti-gay . 
  alrighty then . 
  edit 2 : i mean , have you even read the link provided yourself ? 
   article 1 of the bill amended on protecting children from information harmful to their health and development with a provision classifying `` propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships '' as a class of materials that must not be distributed among minors . 
  the term is defined as materials that are '' [ aimed ] at causing minors to form non-traditional sexual predispositions , notions of attractiveness of non-traditional sexual relationships , distorted ideas about the equal social value of traditional and non-traditional sexual relationships , or imposing information about non-traditional sexual relationships which raises interest in such relationships insofar as these acts do not amount to a criminal offence . '', 
  article 2 makes similar amendments to `` on basic guarantees for the rights of the child in the russian federation '' , commanding the government to protect children from such material . 
   article 3 of the bill amended the code of the russian federation on administrative offenses with article 6.21 , which prescribes penalties for violations of the propaganda ban : russian citizens found guilty can receive fines of up to 5,000 rubles , and public officials can receive fines of up to 50,000 rubles . 
  organizations or businesses can be fined up to 1 million rubles and be forced to cease operations for up to 90 days . 
  foreigners may be arrested and detained for up to 15 days then deported , or fined up to 5,000 rubles and deported . 
  the fines for individuals are much higher if the offense was committed using mass media or internet . 
  so basically gay propaganda towards minors is a sufficient ground to be ... fined by staggering $ 80 , or $ 800 if done by a public official . 
  except he was arrested not for the flag but because the broke through the fence \\ crowd line and tried to run towards the olympic fire . 
  [ here are more pictures of the event ] ( http://imgur.com/a/pfsfx ) , not cherry picked by euronews . 
  especially [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uw62cqr.jpg ) clearly shows the moment before he was arrested . 
  if you can find a law like this , then yes , cite it . 
  this is the case when the phrase `` citation needed ! '', 
  is more relevant than ever . 
  can you please cite the russian anti-gay laws ? 
   your country has anti gay laws by popular choice . 
  * grabs popcorn * now tell me the relevance between ass humping in prime time tv and a twitter post . 
   bring in thousands of these africans bring in ? 
  really ? 
  cybernetics . 
  or head in a jar !, 
   dude what she did is illegal . 
  do i think that that law is kinda retarded ? 
  sure . 
  you do realize this is a political move . 
  nothing else . 
  right ? 
  i mean it 's fascinating how this sub is all up in arms when our governments does something similar , even when justified but in this case it 's just fine . 
  is it because you do n't like her political views ? 
   on another note , imo you should n't push your political agenda using victims . 
  left or right . 
  you should n't tell that there are victims of a violent death cult encroaching onto your country . 
  shhh ... everything is juuuust fine !, 
  fair ? 
  so , she posted pictures , not redacted , showing reality . 
  she 's prosecuted by telling the truth . 
   ** european union legislators ** have `` overwhelmingly '' voted to lift the eu parliamentary immunity of french presidential candidate marine le pen for tweeting pictures of isis violence . 
  so basically the people who stand to lose the most personally in case of the eu failure . 
  what a surprise !, 
  tell me . 
  what do you think about freedom of speech ? 
  not only you failed to understand the post , it 's frankly amazing how you see the world . 
  everything is good or bad and in opposition to each other . 
  can you spot what 's wrong with this logic : ` putin is bad , hence everyone opposing him is good . 
   campaigning journalist that 's called an activist . 
  if you 're pushing an agenda , you 're not a journalist , as you 're no longer reporting facts . 
   her work has been recognized by both amnesty international the same organization that [ says that trump is literally hitler ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2017/02/22/amnesty-international-compares-trump-hitler/98255936/ ) ? 
   and the russian union of journalists but russia does n't have free journalism !, 
  or does it ?!, 
  because if it does n't then this organization ca n't exist and commend an activist . 
  more so from the article :  open russia , an opposition platform funded by millionaire mikhail khodorkovsky with whom svetova has worked , has said that there are currently two fsb officers and 10 investigators in her home . 
  also worked with the person who [ literally scammed russians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_khodorkovsky#yukos_acquisition ) in 90s and engaged in [ illegal tax evasion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yukos#tax_claims ) later but playing a victim now , campaigning for a violent coup in russia while living abroad . 
  how wonderful . 
   gibraltar seizes russian 's superyacht over german debt claim how is it `` russian '' ? 
  it 's a private yacht owned by a russian oligarch ( read criminal from 1990s ) who keeps all of his assets in cyprus . 
  and the yacht is n't even registered as a russian vessel . 
   valla yachts ltd , a bermuda company , is the yacht 's registered owner right in the article .

  so your solution is to believe anything that comes out of ukraine instead ? 
  the title itself is bullshit even though the article does a much better job of explaining it . 
  i lived in chernivtsi , there were many jews there for a long time , now there are none and my parents always told me to never tell anyone that i had a jewish grandmother on my mother 's side . 
  antisemitism still exists , it 's just not the antisemitism that russia claims is happening . 
  jews are n't in danger in ukraine , but nor are they accepted in ukraine . 
  my father worked personally with yatsenyuk in the late 90s when in the ukrsotsbank in chernivtsi , my father was one of the head corporate attorneys in their chernivtsi branch and yatsenyuk visited them quite often from kiev and the bank he was working with . 
  one thing he remembers about him was that yatsenyuk was either jewish or had at least one jewish parent and yet curiously enough , he was also pretty much making a secret of it , hiding what was a fact of his life . 
  in short , things could improve . 
  as the article notes ( i do n't know how much you or others here read of it ) the antisemitism is n't disputed to not be prevalent in ukraine per se , but the important difference is that antisemitism is not institutionalised officially . 
  the ukrainian gov ' t is not antisemitic and it will not run pogroms as the russian media possibly alludes ( i have no idea what they allude , i do n't listen to them at all , honestly ) . 
   not the highest quality one that 's interesting , most vodka drinkers are very nationalistic about their national vodka :p what is good vodka in your view ? 
  you 're an econ major and that was your claim , are you serious ? 
  one country richer = we should trade with it ? 
  have you literally never read anything about ukraine ? 
  to call that a ` scientific observation ' is an absurdity , everybody knows it , but it is n't that simple . 
  why did n't ukraine trade more with eu already if there was so much money there ? 
  because it was easier to sell on the russian market . 
  * eventually * moving trade to the eu is a good idea , but at this current moment , trade ties with russia have to be strengthened , not weakened . 
  once the ukrainian economy stabilises , then you can begin to switch trade partners . 
  you can not simply retool the entire economy in the depths of a crisis to compete in a far more competitive market . 
  half the industries ( conservatively ) in ukraine gave to be scrapped , they would be entirely uncompetitive on the eu market . 
  a crisis is a good time to switch governments and policy , but to pull yourself out of a hole you have to create jobs , not eliminate half of them that are still existing , and then reshuffle the rest . 
  well , granted , you can do it the brutal way too , but remember , politicians will be at the helm of ukraine , not economists . 
  even imf wo n't be able to force ukraine to kill most of its industry right now . 
  it 's not that simple , ukraine does n't trade nearly as much with the eu and russia was offering a sweeter trade deal with no tariffs , instead of decreased ones . 
  and the ukrainian economy is already basically tooled to sell to russia . 
  it is n't very competitive worldwide , it is still a lumbering construct dependent on russia . 
  it is n't stem-logik simple , you ca n't reduce it down to such simplicity . 
  there are many more factors , such as the fact that ukraine simply does n't have much market presence in the eu . 
   surely i know about `` they have authority , they are n't fools '' argument . 
  i do n't believe it . 
  why not however ? 
  the west has every interest to criticise russia . 
  if they found a way to legally implicate russia as the aggressor in georgia , they would . 
  i appreciate your skepticism of russian leadership , i 'll be damned if i trust them myself , but i think you 're going too far with conspiracies here , this one does n't even make sense  _ < there were tensions prior to the start of conflict , yes , these things are n't completely spontaneous . 
  us privately warned saakashvili multiple times not to attack , but he still did it . 
  you know , self-hate goes only so far , you can criticise russia on many things , but you 're coming pretty close to making a spectacle of conspiracies here ... russia was ready for the eventuality of georgia doing stupid things , but nearly every reputable source credits georgia with the honour of starting the war . 
  saakashvili was a bit deranged on foreign policy , much unlike his astute domestic policy . 
  expecting help from the us was foolish , us wo n't get dragged into wwiii over georgia onteh caucasus . 
   for me it was pretty easy since russia `` did not invade georgia '' in 2008 . 
  that 's true though , georgia broke the treaty it previously signed , shelled tskhinvali , injured some russian peacekeepers ... 
  i mean , did putin benefit from it ? 
  yes . 
  but are you going to say that the legal burden of guilt rests on him for starting the war ? 
  and even during the war , georgia actually managed to get themselves no less dirty , which is no small feat when competing with the russian military . 
   joining russia voluntarily during this period is n't wise - to put it mildly . 
  politics are high above most people . 
  the impending economic collapse and/or austerity in ukraine is very real , however . 
  so are jobs . 
  people will worry about putting food on the table , gas in the heater , a flat to live in and a job to pay for it all before they will worry about politics . 
  if the economic situation in ukraine gets any worse , i do n't see why one would n't want to choose russia . 
  that is , provided putin does n't tank the russian economy . 
  however , i do n't think he is that stupid . 
   i could n't believe in pro-russian protests because when i was in kharkiv locals were n't even considering idea/possibility of joining russia - it was non-sesual right , but situation changes . 
  nobody thought that was possible . 
  nonsense was the perfect word to describe it . 
  now we have crimea . 
  nobody i know ever dreamt of joining with russia . 
  now some do , others hate the thought of it . 
  depends on which one of my friends from back home i ask . 
  most of the ones who would n't mind a union with russia want one for the jobs . 
  a lot of people go to work in russia , more jobs there , better pay , easier to get a work visa then in eu ( or especially the us ) . 
  but most of the people i know live in western ukraine and northern moldova , so it is n't even an option for them :p ( not that most would want it ) . 
  however , just about everyone i know does n't want the enmity between russia and ukraine , the trade between the two countries is too close . 
  ukrainian economy is tanking and it has also always been closely linked to russia 's economy . 
  hurting trade with russia is a bad idea . 
  if only the leadership was more sensible , it is possible to have eu in mind as an eventual goal without cutting trade and burning all the bridges with russia . 
   probably because both russia and ukraine was equally poor back then . 
  an interesting fact that a lot of people on this sub do n't realise is that while russia is n't very rosy , it actually got a bit better in terms of raw gdp per capita since the ussr . 
  ukraine is still somehow worse off . 
  ukrainian economy is literally worse than it was in the stifled soviet days . 
  and the corruption is insane . 
  yet a lot of people think here for some reason that the crimeans would n't want to join russia because ` hurr durr russia sux ' . 
  well , it is true , we 've seen better days , but frankly speaking , ukraine is in a really bad situation right now , for purely pragmatic reasons i would cast my lot with russia . 
  preferably not permanently though , god knows what path russia is heading with putin ... 
  i thought i knew the man , we all thought we knew the man , but after crimea it is hard to predict him . 
   ca n't believe urban population can create pro-russian riot being just few years away from joining eu i do n't discount that russia bussed in some agitators ( probably did ) but the east of ukraine is perfectly capable of this on their own too . 
  still , i think that particular quote is false , i 've lived in chernivtsi and kiev -- and yes , those places are quite pro-ukrainian , it has gotten so bad lately that i will get dirty looks from some cashiers if i speak russian or get beat up by a drunk gang ( i am talking like 4 years ago ) . 
  especially chernivtsi . 
  kiev is a mix , and it 's huge , so shit , you can get beat up there for just about anything . 
  on the other hand , i 've been in kharkiv and donetsk ( only transit however , did n't really live there ) and you will get dirty looks at times if you speak ukrainian . 
  i ca n't confirm how the situation is in the east of ukraine exactly , maybe someone here can , but east of ukraine is n't really quite ukrainian in the same sense the west is ... you * really * do n't want to speak russian in lviv for instance . 
  i mean , it 's mostly ok , but you do run the risk of getting jumped by some youths . 
  speaking of getting jumped , i am in the uniquely wonderful situation of potentially getting jumped for being gay in russia or for speaking russian in ukraine , and i lived in both countries ( to further compound this , my family is in moldova and these days most of the youths there do n't speak russian that well ) . 
  it was n't always like this ... 
  i remember in the early 2000s it did n't matter what you spoke . 
  and for older people it still does n't . 
  but if a younger person speaks russian and other younger people hear them , it does n't always end well . 
  my point is that i do n't believe your quote and i am not sure if you ever lived in ukraine . 
  well , that is , i believe a part of the quote . 
  villagers or hired goons is likely , but at the same time , an urban population can be quite pro-russian if you are looking at kharkiv or donetsk . 
  wars with the ottoman empire ( granted , by that point we were doing most of the invading , though only because ottomans were n't powerful enough to invade us anymore as in the past ) ? 
  only the united coalition of western euro countries , plus also turkey during the crimean war ? 
  fears of further invasions that prompted russia to drop alaska for a penny because the tsars did n't think they could hold it on the event of a british invasion from canada ? 
  and in the 20th century , the great war , aka wwi where the russian empire was split apart ? 
  i am sorry , was that a joke about russia did not suffering invasions in that time period , or do they literally not teach world history in sweden ? 
  *** do n't be naive , if poland was powerful enough , it would create one . 
  the reason other nations ` let ' a powerful nation have a buffer zone is because it is more convenient to do that rather than to bear the big stink of a larger nation throwing fits . 
  in fact poland tried to create a buffer zone anyway , they [ got a war with the ussr post wwii by trying to grab ukraine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war ) . 
  pilsudski was a courageous and sharp-witted leader , even as he failed he still gets credit for making a good effort .

  ussr worked on uprooting identity except russian identity which was promoted . 
  oh come on , this is bullshit . 
  how much in common does the ussr have with the russian empire ? 
  it 's as much `` russian '' as it is georgian or kazakh . 
  / u/kinmix explained , while i can explaine the reasoning . 
  international standards . 
  it 's up to the captain to make a decision to prevent the airports from getting in cahoots with certain airlines and refusing their competitors . 
  i ca n't quite tell if you are being sarcastic or not . 
  well , that would be insane , because i do n't think 319 has ever been used in relation to president ( though it could be used for that ) . 
  it 's used when someone insults acting police officers or judges or people like that . 
  the proposed law is silly . 
  but if you have an idiotic law of your own , you do n't get to point fingers and scream bloody murder . 
   another thing is that which countries really go out for looking those people who are talking shit about the leader of their country and who are not . 
  so , when was the last time someone was judged for insulting putin ? 
  article 319 is primarily used when someone is attacking police or judge , since they count as government representatives . 
   these laws are new . 
  they are enforced . 
  they are not enforced because they do n't fucking exist yet . 
  the article is about a law proposal , not an actual law . 
  i 'm still not sure what you are trying to argue . 
  there are laws against insulting the head of the state in most european countries . 
  that is a fact . 
  there 's a law against insulting president of germany . 
  there 's a law against insulting spanish royal family . 
  you are being hypocritical when you are trying to hold this law * proposal * as an example of horrible totalitarian state of russia . 
  this law proposal is stupid , and i hope it does n't get through . 
  but you need to stop lying :  you can ( and people do ) insult the head of state all the time both publicly and privately in any western democracy . 
  and you are trying to equate the law that was actually used with a proposal by a regional pm in russia . 
  [ how about people being fined in spain ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7092866.stm ) ? 
  and look at the downvote brigade rolling in ...  public figures should never be beyond a common man when it comes to law . 
  i agree . 
  this law is stupid , and i hope it wo n't be passed .

  i know poroshenko is bad , but `` a tyrant and a despot '' ? 
   good guy putin , raising consumption in the us [ i hope not ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tuberculosis ), 
  so when will ukraine declare war with russia and stop fighting `` terrorists '' ? 
  it 's stavropol :p also togliatti is a valid english spelling of \u0422\u043e\u043b\u044c\u044f\u0442\u0442\u0438 alongside tolyatti . 
  hughesovka , i guess , would be the most correct . 
   st. petersburg in florida named after the hometown of one of its founders . 
  russian donetsk is the oldest , and is called that because it 's on the river don . 
  ukrainian donetsk was originally called usovka after its founder john hughes . 
  it got renamed into `` stalinov '' after the revolution and in donetsk in the 60s ( after the river donets , which is nowhere near ) . 
  ukrainian ssr was weird . 
  i do n't know what 's up with the kazahkstan 's donetsk village . 
   first , respondents may be lying . 
  in a [ recent study ] ( http://kommersant.ru/doc/2897562 ) , levada center showed that 26 percent of russians are afraid to express their opinions in surveys . 
  asking whether someone supports war in putin 's russia is pretty sensitive ; some may feel lying is safer . 
  so perhaps more russian muslims disapprove of putin 's intervention in syria than we know . 
  it 's like no one bothered to read the third goddamn paragraph of the article they are linking which very clearly states the opinion of the vice-director of levada :  \u0418\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438 \u0432 \u0441\u043e\u0446\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0430\u0445 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u043b\u043e\u044f\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043a \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 , \u0447\u0435\u043c \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u044f\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a \u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435 , \u043d\u043e \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441-\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441 \u043d\u0430 5 %  sometimes polled people speak about the government more positively than they really think , ** but in reality the evaluation error is more or less 5 % ** . 
  it 's actually worse . 
  there 's another donetsk in kazakhstan . 
  and there was also another donetsk in luhasnk region of ukraine many years ago . 
  same in russian : `` sobaka layet , karavan idet '' . 
  i think the phrase actually originates in azerbaijan . 
  we have both of those sayings exactly . 
  * the apple does n't fall far from the tree . 
  * make the fool pray to god , he 'll bust his own forehead . 
  * seven fridays in a week -- about a person who changes his mind constantly * you made the porrige - you eat it -- deal with the consequences of your actions * grey gets in the beard , devil gets in the -- old people be crazy, 
  believe it or not , but stalin is also remembered for industrialisation and victory in wwii rather than for gulags . 
  i must be missing the op 's point . 
  5th of march is when stalin died , so people ( most likely organised by the communist party ) gathered to put down flowers for him . 
  is that supposed to be a horrible sign of evil russia being evil ? 
  are we supposed to revile stalin and burn down all images of him ? 
  sealiously ? 
  indeed !, 
  this all worked out swimmingly . 
  phew . 
  navaly avoided the crisis here . 
  i seal what you did there . 
  cool story , bro . 
  economical mismanagement and us being better at the cold war definitely had nothing to do with anything . 
  ussr fell purely because of terror . 
  because countries and alliances do n't last forever . 
  ussr fell apart after 70 years of existence . 
  why would anyone assume that eu is where we hit the perfection , and that alliance will totally last until the heat death of the universe ? 
  guessing what will happen 25 years into the future is pointless , because geopolitical landscape could be completely changed by that point . 
  russia too . 
  quite a few countries , including every single ex-ussr country . 
  at least someone did n't add `` because they were destroyed by glorious stronk russia '' to the text . 
  okay ? 
  what does russia have to do with anything ? 
  in 20-25 years russia could very well not exist either . 
  ussr existed for all of 70 years . 
  talking about things 20 years into the future has all acuracy of reading sheep guts . 
  considering that in 20-25 years nato , ukraine and eu could very well not exist - pretty much , yes . 
   holy shit , this sounds like every post-revolution government ever there , i fixed it . 
  i 've never been so disappointed by the article . 
   i thought that that was just because of tradition . 
  it was because kirza boots used by the russian army were nearly impossible to wear with socks .

and maybe this article is bullshit . 
   the police are corrupt and inefficient . 
  of course this is going to lead to a rise in vigilantism vs. a perceived and/or real threat . 
  caucasians are often involved in organized crime and standing up to them and attempting to arrest one will lead to revenge and the policeman in question is definitely risking hsi life and health . 
  of course this is the fault of a shitty and corrupt investigation of organized crime , but the individual officers are often simply helpless . 
   this happens in many countries and it works both ways . 
  still does n't excuse the immigrants in any way . 
  this guy knows what 's up . 
  10/10 can confirm . 
  jesus , is russia is literally * hell on earth * , why not go back to the ivory coast ? 
  i 'm sure a black man is pretty safe in africa or even america . 
  oh wait ... now i 'm sad . 
  zero action ? 
  i 'd say the sanctions have been pretty effective so far if we can trust the current predictions for russian economy . 
  also , the reaction has been quite strong . 
  not a day goes by that the baltics along with poland do n't ask for help because they are afraid putin comes for them next . 
  every other week an article headlines international media , dealing with how putin has a big ego and a small dick and a rusty economy or something along those lines . 
  and this argument `` yeah the western coalition fucked up some wars and brought thugs and extremists to power , but hey , at least we did n't annex those countries ! '', 
  gets repeated pretty often . 
  i do n't see how it matters , aside from the obvious standpoint of international law . 
  if i were a citizen of egypt , i 'd be pretty mad right now . 
  there used to be a corrupt president but now they have sharia law . 
  they went from bad to way worse . 
  how great for all the women , gays and people with more than two braincells . 
  and the worst thing about this : either the western leaders did n't know who they were supporting or they did n't care . 
  i do n't know which version is worse . 
  the west set a precedent in that time that you can do whatever the fuck you want if you want it bad enough , while putin was protesting on the sidelines . 
  and now europe likes to present itself as the peaceful incorporation of innocence but come on , that is just not true . 
  and while i disagree with the annexation of crimea and the whole ukraine situation , i wish people in the west were a little more self-conscious and realized that the world where putin does what he wants because he believes in the right of the strongest was created by their own hands . 
  aw shucks , it 's so fun to see you frothing at a simple question . 
  no need to lose your temper though . 
  the arab rebels are related in so far as that the west massively supported them , calling them `` freedom fighters '' and dropping bombs on kaddafi 's head . 
  nobody gave a shit that they were power hungry islamists mixed with various mercs from saudi arabia and other shady factions . 
  and now look how great that turned out for the libyan people , they are an islamic emirate now . 
  now russia is supporting a rebellion that it 's interested in and everyone loses their shit , `` the red menace returns '' . 
  this is hypocricy in its finest form . 
  the west can do whatever the fuck they want to brown people , but if russia , who has a comparatively clean record for the last decades when it comes to foreign involvement , tries to influence what used to be its territory 20 years ago and is culturally still russian , they call it `` invasion '' and the shit hits the fan . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm not a friend of putin and his whole deal ( i fucking hate that i always need to state that ) , but this whole situation and the way it 's reported is way misrepresented . 
  already corrected . 
  these subs are very similar when it comes to uneducated overreaction , forgive me . 
  the nato is n't shitting its pants though . 
  they just report the data . 
  they said it 's nothing unusual . 
  but people in this thread are freaking the fuck out . 
  the red scare is back in this motherfucka like it 's 1956 again . 
  and let me ask a hypothetical querstion : nobody invaded the ukraine . 
  while there may be russian soldiers there , the seperatist movement originated in the ukraine . 
  * ukrainians * started this shit . 
  while the west has supported rebels in libya , egypt etc. , what 's wrong with russia supporting their rebels of choice ? 
  read the previous comment . 
  international airspace . 
  nothing was violated . 
  it 's hilarious seeing everybody shitting their collective pants over this , especially teenagers from poland and the baltics . 
  but this is / r/europe , a kneejerk circlejerk , aint nobody got time to research shit . 
  who in their right mind translated `` otechestvo '' as motherland when it * literally * means fatherland ? 
  otec = father . 
  many of today 's jews are descended from the askenazi jews who used to settle in central europe and in german territory . 
  hence their german last names and the yiddish language , a weird mixture of german and hebraic . 
  i 'm pretty fluent in german and i kinda understand some yiddish words . 
  no , that 's not what i 'm telling you and he probably should . 
  in that vein , the anti-putin side is also pretty damn rabid . 
  if you dare to make up your own mind without subscribing to all of their agenda , you are a vatnik retard and communist pawn with a slave mentality . 
  as i said , shit is really hitting the fan over here . 
  what i 'm telling you is that one should n't always confuse street thugs being street thugs with any political context without knowing wtf happened first and my experience tells me that this were probably 2 dumbfucks looking to cause trouble , no matter what the reason . 
   brainwashed `` patriots '' watch road rage videos from russia . 
  this has a reason , some people are really comfortable using vilence to settle disputes . 
  people often look for reasons to vent their anger . 
  seeing some anti government guy is very convenient because he 's 100 % not affiliated with cops or any influential people and that means there is little risk in trying to fuck with him and possibly mug him . 
  there need n't be any political motivation here . 
  it may be his fault for being the current president and czar . 
  of course , the whole political climate right now is far from good so that may have contributed because people are very divided on these issues . 
  however , the point i 'm trying to raise is that the tradition of violence unfortunately has a history here and some people really just need a reason to let out their anger , no matter what . 
  it 's naive to instantly link everything to putin without any insight on russian mentality . 
  some people just need an excuse to beat someone up , especially in russia . 
  it sucks but it 's true . 
  also , the general public frowns upon public display of idealism , no matter for which side . 
  probably remains of old soviet mentality , i do n't know . 
  i 'm not defending putin . 
  any form of loud political opinion has always been frowned upon in russia , long before the recent ukraine trouble . 
  10 or 15 years ago it may have been something else , but getting in trouble with strangers for publically stating your opinion unfortunately is an integral part of life here because to every opinion there will be violent supporters and opposers . 
  this may be remnants of soviet mentality , i do n't know . 
  but people generally do n't like others being all out there with public messages . 
  it does n't mean someone sent or paid them . 
  this is not an indicator of fascism , just a mentality difference . 
  if i go on the street and wave a flag supporting gays , a bunch of idiots will kick my ass . 
  if i wave a flag against gays , some other idiots will try the same ( probably not as many because there are less gay supporters but the violent percentage is always there , i swear ) . 
  that 's just part of life . 
  again , nobody here is from russia and you probably do n't care because this is an echo chamber . 
  sooo , 2 gopniks assault a guy , so it must be putin 's fault ? 
  jeezus . 
  if i wear a `` fuck nazis '' patch and get my ass kicked by 2 skinheads ( actually happened ) , is it still hitlers fault ? 
  or maybe just stupid people being stupid ? 
  if you have a football shirt and fans from the opposing team kick your ass ( happens all the time everywhere ) , whose fault is it ? 
  when in the us cops shoot another black guy , is it obamas fault ? 
  or maybe the local pd needs to weed out the shitty cops ? 
  putin has lots of support among the less literate people and the guy probably knew what he was getting into when he wrote that message on his car . 
  in fact i bet he speculated on the fact that he 'd get in trouble so he could generate some public reaction . 
  the point of the previous comment was : we are rightfulyl scared that russians will come and fuck up our country . 
  barely any of your criticisms explained that fear . 
  you people are afraid russia will come to poland/baltics because of fucking homophobia ?

however , the outflows were matched by illegal transfers of money into russia . 
  almost 2 trillion was funneled into the country between 1994 and 2012 , the report said . 
  it works great in eu because dacia is essentially the cheapest option available there , so the name does n't really matter that much . 
  on the other hand , in russia it 's priced slightly above lada and some chinese brands . 
  and i imagine in this case it would be rather hard to sell a romanian car with an awkward name , that sounds like [ `` dacha '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dacha ) in russian . 
  avtovaz ( lada ) , as well as dacia , is owned by renault-nissan . 
  they also produce your regular [ renault-branded logan ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0fi3nnj.jpg ) and sandero at the same plants here . 
  as far as imported parts go , renault is actually quite efficient . 
  for logan they source [  70 % of the parts domestically ] ( http://www.autostat.ru/application/includes/uploadimg/10054.jpg ) , more than some of the ladas own models . 
  something [ like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mctcyoi.jpg ) , relatively close to the city , 400-500m2 .

  they should probably start with banning porn on vk . 
  i think , after collapse of the ussr , nato should 've been either dissolved ( and possibly replaced by some kind of eu-only alliance ) or reconstructed ( maybe under another name ) to include russia . 
  doing that would 've killed , once and for all , the retarded idea of a ` multipolar world ' , and all of the problems we have now would 've probably be avoided .

  they have some very questionable data there . 
   median wealth ... 871 usd per adult ... what ? 
  well , they saw how western media/politicians reacted , they saw mccain and nulland in kiev shaking hands with the opposition and that was basically it . 
  also , putin had to blame somebody for the revolution . 
  the obvious choice is us , simply because the eu in the eyes of the general russian public are mostly seen as us puppets .

  because despite some occasional lame rituals , the majority of russians are still only culturally christian/borderline atheist . 
  sure , putin uses the church in his propaganda war , but it is n't getting far enough to actually meddle with people 's lifestyle . 
  russians hate gays because they think it 's `` gross '' or whatever , not because the bible says so . 
  i would imagine the majority have no idea what the bible actually says about gays ( or in general ) , and the church are n't the ones pushing that issue . 
  or maybe because it costs you nothing and actually makes the city better ? 
  corruption or not , most of these were really really ugly , and i 'm glad they 're gone . 
  even if some of the freed space might be used for new developments it will still be worth it .

   oil + gas accounts for ~ 70 % of russia 's exports , more than 50 % of budget , well over 30 % of gdp . 
  i think at this point it 's like 50 % of our exports , maybe even less ( there is also some hefty trade surplus though ) . 
  and as far as budget goes , for 2016 they plan to get around 40 % from oil & gas running 3-5 % deficit . 
  apparently they thought paris attacks were over-hyped compared to the plane , with all the french flags and everything .

  because they want to appear `` moral '' and the church is one of those institutions that are still somehow viewed in a positive light . 
  at the same time very few people can actually be bothered to be religious .

  well , this particular one was hardly random . 
  the guy has 250k subs on youtube and in that video he was basically `` testing '' the law ( it worked , obviously ) .

  or , which is more likely , nothing will happen and it would be just yet another law ignored by everybody , but occasionally used for selective prosecution . 
  they watched too many english hooligan movies and decided to show them how it 's done . 
  it was the anti-protest law in this case . 
  they were holding a big sign ( `` love wins '' in english ) and police officers assumed they were going to protest something rather than just leave it at the memorial . 
  then kazakh government gave up on supporting their currency and switched to a free floating rate ( same as ruble ) . 
  that 's way too expensive , should be around 5 $ in any half-decent retail chain . 
  still overpriced though , and i guess that 's why it seems to be always on sale whenever i see it .

  there 's also a possibility the entire thing was made up by the source ( liberal newspaper , novaya gazeta ) that 's have been at various times suspected of colliding with the security apparatus ( aka the fsb and friends ) who happened to hate kadyrov ( for good reasons ) . 
  that 's hardly surprising considering that mcdonald 's joints in russia are disproportionately concentrated in major cities with nearly half of them located in moscow .

  but i 'll give you that , uk and france did have a military pact with poland and they decided to honor it . 
   at that time the soviet union was co-operating with germany to divide up eastern europe . 
  i know that bashing ussr is fashionable right now , but at that time uk and france cooperated with germany to solve the `` czechoslovakian problem '' ( direct quote from chamberlain ) . 
  czechoslovakian industry and arsenal were a major factor in the following growth of germany . 
  and at the same time us was selling massive quantities of oil to germany and financed nationalist movement which led hitler to power . 
   `` they asked me why i did n't have any children , '' she remembers .

  that 's hardly the biggest problem with ttip .

  over asia usa has economic power via oil dollar and its muppets ( like japan and south korea ) . 
  you mean when georgia was the agressor and even osce reported that ? 
   in fact that 's true , russia nationalised over 250 private companies in crimea as of february as well as all of those owned by ukrainian state . 
  most of those belonged to kolomoyskiy , so i ca n't feel bad about them .

  but you have to agree that `` no evidence of world cup corruption found '' is a worse headline than `` russia & qatar may lose world cups '', 
  and so the propaganda attack begins . 
  all three of those things are `` in case of russian invasion '' . 
   does n't matter if nato or anybody is actually `` afraid '' or not of course it does matter . 
  if nato is afraid of russia invading , then saying `` nato is afraid of russia '' invading is not patronising . 
  and if nato is n't afraid of russia invading , then why does the us promise to install those new military bases in europe and screams how eu is n't spending enough on military ?

  the big question is : is this support , or is this a token gesture for the eu ? 
  the evidence points to the latter , as the parade members were asked to disperse after they walked for 500m . 
  so then you agree that two out of three points in the bellingcat analysis are wrong and we no longer need to discuss them , we can just focus on the `` reference analysis '' part of the bellingcat report ? 
  i never understand why people need a parade to celebrate where they stick their dicks . 
   ok , so the dutch report is finished ?

  most asian migrants i 've talked with in the last years ca n't even string a coherent sentence together .

  however , the active fighting in ukraine is limited to a tiny area in the easternmost part of the country , so i imagine it would n't be affecting the number of migrants .

  just for example : a ukrainian friend of mine who has lived in moscow for a decade or more was denied re-entry at once and had to marry a moscow girl to get a russian visa back . 
  plus the general attitude towards the ukrainians is currently not as rosy as it used to be .

  #recep tayyip erdogan seeks limitless power ## the turkish president has wilfully cut himself off from any free flow of critical information * may 11 , 2016 by : david gardner * president recep tayyip erdogan last week pushed out ahmet davutoglu , the prime minister he himself had handpicked , seemingly to clear his way towards the untrammelled one-man rule he has sought since he moved from the premiership to turkey 's presidency two years ago . 
  conventional wisdom says mr erdogan is surrounding himself with loyalists . 
  but the man he has just defenestrated is a loyalist . 
  he joins a long list of those jettisoned from the president 's inner circle over the past two years , in a processional purge that is starting to look like standard political procedure . 
  the ruling justice and development party ( akp ) , a conservative coalition with roots in political islam , came to power in 2002 as cautious and wary outsiders . 
  they scarcely had a toehold in a secular state built by mustafa kemal ataturk from the rubble of the ottoman empire . 
  initially , they relied on the shadowy islamist movement headed by fethullah gulen , a us-based imam , which over three decades had inserted its cadres into the judiciary , the police and then the intelligence services . 
  over time , and swept forward by mr erdogan 's electoral triumphs , the new akp establishment supplanted the old secular elites . 
  with the help of the gulenists , and by fair means or foul , it elbowed aside generals and judges who , as late as 2008 , were trying to get the akp banned . 
  all this helps explain why , even now , the akp often behaves more like an opposition than turkey 's paramount party . 
  this paranoia grew exponentially after the mid-2013 demonstrations nationwide against mr erdogan 's intrusive and increasingly authoritarian rule . 
  after the gulen network launched corruption probes into the erdogan inner circle later that year , the then prime minister treated the crisis as existential , shutting down the investigation and launching a purge of gulenists that continues today . 
  it is also something of a paradox that mr erdogan has cocooned himself among courtiers . 
  he had , after all , created a genuine mass movement , widely seen at the time as a muslim analogue to european-style christian democracy . 
  before first winning power in october 2002 , the akp spent 22 months interviewing in depth 42,000 people across the country . 
  by 2013 , it became clear that the feedback loop of this well-oiled political machine had been short-circuited by sycophants . 
  mr erdogan evidently feels more comfortable surrounded by ciphers . 
  at the time of the 2013 turmoil , abdullah gul , then president , a co-founder of the akp and a more emollient foil to mr erdogan 's abrasive personality , assured turks that `` the messages with good intentions [ from the protests ] were received '' .

  [ 4 ] [ 3 ] the second largest religion in germany is islam , with between 2.1 and 4.7 million adherents ( 2.6 % to 5.7 % ) . 
  good . 
  the west is yet again is trying to use the unsc as their soapbox to make the bad guy out of russia . 
  however , all vetoed resolutions on syria ( except one ) were vetoed not just by russia , but by china as well . 
  the ceasefire works : * stats of destroyed armored vehicles of both sides per month : http://lostarmour.info/analytics/ after march 2015 it just vanishes . 
  * ukrainian side casualties per month : http://memorybook.org.ua/indexfile/statmonth.htm ( height of columns is misleading ) . 
  in august 2014 alone ukrainian army lost more people than in the whole 2016 . 
  a lot of these 2016 casualties are non-combat casualties , like drunks playing with firearms , own mines , brawls , or sickness . 
  * civilian casualties are down , see ohchr report , page 11 : http://www.ohchr.org/documents/countries/ua/uareport16th_en.pdf and _ ukraine _ mostly kills civilians , nowadays , not the rebels : `` 23 . 
  shelling from various artillery systems caused over 60 per cent of all civilian casualties : 13 killed ( three women and ten men ) and 88 injured ( 37 women and a girl , 48 men and a boy , and an adult whose sex is not known ) . 
  20 percent of these casualties ( three killed and 18 injured ) were recorded in the government-controlled territories , while ** 80 percent ( 10 killed and 70 injured ) were recorded in the territories controlled by the armed groups . ** '' . 
  * there was no significant offensives or territorial changes since minsk-ii after the end of the battle of debaltsevo . 
  and in those few movements that did happen it was the _ ukrainian side _ that tried to advance , tried to take control over gray area or rebel strong points . 
  ukraine got the second par of shirokino , gray zone here and there , the rebels did n't advance anywhere . 
  the ceasefire works , intensity of the current conflict is just non-comparable with intensity of 2014-2015 war . 
  and when _ it does n't _ work ukraine is very far from being innocent . 
  overall , i do n't see a single legitimate reason for ukraine not to implement article 11 . 
  they are probably do n't feel much of external pressure and they are sure that eu/us still will support them no matter if they are going to implement minsk-2 or not . 
  and having permanent war is not bad for local ukrainian political elites . 
   if everyone in crimea is so happy to be back , let 's have another referendum . 
  fully planned , with the support of opposition parties ukraine and the west would never agree on such referendum , exactly because they know very well that the result will not be good for them . 
  it 's an illusion that larger preparation period or fair electoral campaigns for both sides , or independent vote counting will change anything at all . 
  no , it would not be 97 % ( it 's the result of vote fraud ) , it would be 90 % , or maybe even 80 % support . 
  okay , let 's imagine 70 % support , which is on extremely unlikely side . 
  there is no way it would be lower . 
  these numbers change nothing , it 's still supermajority . 
  and why should n't they support reunification with russia ? 
  crimea has russian majority , russia is significantly more developed country than ukraine -- why in the world would they want to get back to ukraine ? 
  especially after all ukrainian friendly tricks like cutting electricity to crimea , banning trade and so on . 
  according to several opinion polls ( including polls by western pollsters ) , idea to return to ukraine has 2-3 % of support in crimea . 
   then have international observers present at the voting booths so there can be no doubt and the question is settled for good . 
  russia invited international observers . 
  osce and other international organizations declined to participate . 
   having a legitimate referendum is the logical next step and since all of crimea apparently wants to stay as part of russia , then the result will come out the same and russia will have nothing to lose !, 
  second referendum would not be accepted by the west just like the first . 
  at the very best it will be pointless . 
  hmm , it 's strange that you forgot much closer historical example :  1991 : crimea is ukrainian and never will be russian again !, 
   2014 : oops ... 
  considering sudetenland -- yeah , i remember . 
  it happened when the nazis attacked russia and got their asses whipped after slaughterhouse with  50m total death toll . 
  just to transfer crimea to ukraine against the will of crimean population ? 
  absolute majority of crimeans consider themselves part of russia , absolute majority of russians consider crimea part of russia . 
  it 's very unlikely that russia will give up its integral part . 
  there is no politician in the entire russian political spectrum to propose such inane thing as gifting crimea to ukraine again -- at most navalny proposes new referendum ( with predictable results ) . 
  actually , all the soviet republics ( including baltic soviet republics ) had the right to exit the soviet union . 
  check any soviet constitution . 
  ah , sweet dreams  too bad that in our harsh reality crimea is not ukraine and will never belong to ukraine again . 
  however , crimea is indeed the most ukrainian territory in russia , the op is n't wrong . 
  it has slightly more ukrainians ( 16 % ) than sevastopol ( 14.2 % ) and yamalo-nenets autonomous okrug ( 9.7 % ) . 
  tragic to whom ? 
  that 's how the `` tragic event '' looked like for crimean population : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo2cwldet-4 crimea returned to its home , for the most of the crimeans it 's one of the happiest events in whole their lives . 
  indeed , it 's a truly tragic event for banderites , ukrainian nationalists and their western puppeteers . 
  they were slapped so hard that their head is still spinning , kicked so well that they still feel severe pains in their rear -- it 's evident from this very thread . 
  but somehow i do n't feel really sorry for them , 
  the right way to read / r/europe comments -- from bottom to top . 
  the most informative answer usually is the most downvoted one . 
  it was fabricated , it was a politically motivated kangaroo court and navalny was indeed involved in some really shady schemes that look like ordinary fraud through shell/mailbox companies . 
  looks like a duck , walks like a duck , and probably was a duck . 
  but the investigators were incompetent or lazy , or maybe there were other reasons , but in the end they managed to fuck up even when they had royal flash in their hands . 
   1000 is enough for statistics ~ 3 % sampling error with 95 % confidence interval . 
  wow . 
  that shit is hilarious . 
  are you seriously that delusional ? 
  honduras has the largest murder rate in the world and like 1/5 gdp ( ppp ) per capita in comparison to russia . 
  but i am not even surprised that in your imagination nothing ticks as wrong , when you see honduras higher than russia in the index of `` fragile states '' ( whatever does it mean ) . 
   russia is more fragile than honduras hmm , i always wondered about the point of these bullshit ratings coming from silly-named organizations like `` the united states think-tank fund for peace '' . 
  i mean nobody can be that stupid to take them seriously ? 
  now i see that they can be used to prove that your country is better than other countries in internet discussions . 
  just in some irrelevant ratings , but larger numbers are still larger numbers . 
  you are just pulling shit out of your ass . 
  you invented _ ad hoc _ theory not confirmed by anything whatsoever , just because the facts were inconvenient for your worldview based on western propaganda . 
  [ there ] ( https://wciom.ru/index.php?id=236&amp;uid=115770 ) [ were opinion ] ( http://openopinion.ru/content_res/articles/oo_crimea_brief.pdf ) polls done in 2016 , they confirmed results from older polls . 
  ~ 90 % support reunification , 2-3 % dislike it . 
   were expecting the annexation to bring higher pensions , more jobs , higher wages and everything was hugs and promises yeah . 
  and that 's exactly what really happened . 
  even if russia is in state of financial crisis , the gap between ukraine and russia was too large , and it probably even increased since 2014 . 
  most of people notice improvements in the quality of their life -- and these are the results of opinion polls , not just your imagination . 
  actually crimean level of satisfaction is higher than russian average . 
  feels bad , is n't it ? 
   russia is as shitty as a shitty country can be it 's truly golden to hear this from portugal . 
  \\ ^ geopolitical wisdoms from / r/europe posters . 
   defending crimea no , it 's just western world leaders are not as terminally dumb as ordinary / r/europe users , and did n't want to start war against russia to defend crimea from crimeans . 
  me reading this thread https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48h34ukfe8g / r/europe never disappoints :d, 
  russia is a great country . 
  you may dislike this fact , but bitching in / r/europe about it will hardly change it . 
  it would be awesome if these clowns will indeed try to continue attack on polish sovereignty from the eu . 
  ca n't wait for further weakening and deconstruction of this shitty globalist behemoth . 
  that feel when even censor.net.ua ( crazy nationalistic ukrainian shithole ) is more truthful than western propaganda . 
  i have to say , it 's an achievement of some sort , congrats to bbc . 
  http://censor.net.ua/blogs/4667/smena_rastet_ili_pochm_nynche_para_veder_soldatskoyi_krovi ukrainians attacked rebel positions on their own initiative and took control over one rebel strong point . 
  donbasians counter-attacked and encircled the attackers , and now nationalists are crying about their high casualties in the failed blitzkrieg blaming incompetent generals and poor planning , while ukrainian officials are bragging about `` repulsed rebel offensive '' and western propaganda outlets uncritically reposts them . 
  if you read russian , i recommend reading transcripts from 2007-2008 roundtables in moscow state university between major russian and ukrainian historians on this very topic -- `` genocide of ukrainians vs common tragedy of ussr people '' . 
  * http://www.hist.msu.ru/labs/ukrbel/obrukr-golod.htm * http://www.hist.msu.ru/labs/ukrbel/golod_final.htm position of russian historians -- it was a man-made famine , unlike other major famines of 1921 and 1947-48 , but it was n't planned , it was a `` social genocide '' if you like , but it was n't a genocide against ukrainians . 
  kondrashin , one of the top russian scholars on 32-33 famine , summed up the general points ( he is also member of the united russia and deputy of the federation council , so that 's almost official russian pov ) : * [ ... ] population contracted in kazakhstan by 30.9 % , in volga region by 23 % , in ukraine by 20.5 % , nothern caucasus - 20.4 % [ ... ] * the famine happened in a result of anti-peasant policy of the stalin 's regime during the first five-year plan , its mistakes and anti-humane measures against peasantry that lead to destruction of agriculture and famine . 
  * it was n't planned , but stalin 's regime used it to force peasants to work in _ kolkhozes _ and enforce the chosen political course . 
  * the famine had regional specifics that defined its scale and results . 
  it hit first on zones of total collectivisation , in areas where the state met with active resistance against grain procurement . 
  * situation in ukraine was defined first and foremost by grain specialization of the republic , high population density in zones of total collectivization , scale of resistance of peasantry and response to the resistance by central and local authorities , measures to suppress resistance and protect _ kolkhoz _ system . 
  * famine of 1932-33 and overall crisis of ukrainian economy , just as famine of 1921-22 , let stalin 's regime to solve other problems ( in 1921 it was destruction of opposition in the russian orthodox church , in 1930s it was suppression of potential growth of national movement in ukraine ) . 
  but the reason of the tragedy in the ukrainian ssr , just like in other regions of the ussr , was n't national question , but problems of strengthening of _ kolkhoz _ system , economics overall , political regime , solved by stalinists with methods from their arsenal , linked to the nature of victorious regime and person of its leader .

  it 's a shame that attack on privacy is a global trend though . 
  you link to a modern polish word . 
  the correct link contains two meanings and is https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reconstruction:proto-slavic/krajina edit : i should also point out that the comment by / u/sclonelypilot was not about `` kraina '' . 
  i 'm not suggesting this . 
  if you have read my messages , i 'm not suggesting that either of the versions is true . 
  unlike you , i 'm not pretending to be qualified enough to have any independent view on this matter . 
  i merely point out that your approach is anti-scientific . 
  e.g. , in addition to those `` likely '' , for some reason you find your silent assumption that `` ukraina '' is derived from `` kraina '' obvious . 
  it 's not . 
  your support of one version of etymology is completely fine , i never had any intention to oppose it . 
  however , your inability to acknowledge that there is an open dispute in etymology is not . 
  your attempts at disproving actual research behind one of the versions with fancy wordplay and without digging into historical documents are irritating to me as a scientist . 
  i 'm sure that historians and linguists whose version you support did a much better job at contesting the another hypothesis . 
  i also find the further discussion rather pointless , as initially i wanted just to point out a false claim about communists . 
  do you really intend to use `` most likely '' and `` there is no reason to suspect '' as serious arguments in linguistics ? 
  that 's utterly anti-scientific . 
  frankly , a lot of researchers of different times and countries have reasons to suspect that it is not the case . 
  btw , using ad hominem and claiming that i have an agenda is not a valid argument either . 
  you initially made two statements which i ca n't consider as valid arguments because 1 . 
  invented by communist -- simply false . 
  `` but it was used by communists '' does n't make it less false . 
  usage by communists also does n't affect the validity/invalidity of the version . 
  meaning in modern ukrainian -- true , but not relevant for the question of etymology . 
  thus i objected , not because i wanted to disagree with your position on the etymology . 
  the argument about word `` kraj '' is fair , so i do n't object it . 
  i 'm focusing on this meaning solely because you did n't acknowledge its existence and also made a false claim that the version based on this meaning was invented by communists . 
  i 'm not a qualified linguist to have an independent opinion on which version of etymology is true , but i still can point out some fallacies . 
  do you understand what etymology is ? 
  it 's about history of language , it does n't matter what '' \u043a\u0440\u0430\u00ef\u043d\u0430 '' means in modern ukrainian whatsoever . 
  upd : regarding the word '' \u043a\u0440\u0430\u00ef\u043d\u0430 '' . 
  proto-slavic '' * krajina '' was derived from `` edge '' , see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krajina ( there 're quite a lot of references ) . 
  meaning of `` kraj '' or `` krajina '' as `` area '' seems more recent . 
  facts ? 
  this version of etymology was definitely known before communists . 
  see , e.g. , polish slownik geograficzny of the end of the xix century or small brockhaus and efron encyclopedic dictionary . 
  hrushevsky also supported this version , but he can barely be called a communist sympathizer . 
  edit : by the way , meaning in modern languages is irrelevant when we 're talking about etymology . 
   the whole borderland bullshit is invented by fuckheads who ca n't see difference between u/v and o letters . 
  considering the slavic word was `` oukraina '' and contained both of these letters , this argument does n't sound very good . 
  i do n't know what the hell you 're talking about , but russian troops took over crimea at least as early as february 26-27 , while its independence was declared on march 17 after the `` referendum '' . 
  there was no second referendum , by the way . 
  the very benefit of the tourist industry . 
  i bring money from my country into your country and help create jobs in the tourist industry . 
  it can also positively influence relations between countries and cultures in the long run . 
  for me , schengen visa usually adds about 10 % to the cost . 
  not that big of a deal , but it 's still not a negligible sum of money . 
  the process of applying for a visa also wastes time ( especially for people outside big cities in which you can apply ) and ensures that i ca n't just spontaneously decide to buy airplane tickets for the next weekend . 
  edit : i also think that visa requirements can be a put-off for those who have never traveled . 
  collecting all documents , filling in the visa form , standing in a queue in a visa center is just not a very pleasant experience . 
  the most obvious benefit is more tourists . 
  fame is often a historical thing and should be judged after a couple of decades . 
  what about howard behrens , rob gonsalves , joe dowden ? 
  painting has also became less popular because of photography and cinematography , so it is expected to see way less big names . 
  what a joke . 
  why would you compare an actual restaurant to a kebab kiosk ? 
  compare things of the same level . 
  have you never seen a good chinese/turkish restaurant ? 
  we have kiosks with pancakes and pierogi here , are they somehow related to multiculturalism ? 
  comparing historic center of prague to new york chinatown , really ? 
  what is the message here ? 
  do you expect breathtaking architecture in a not-that-old district populated by an ethnic minority ? 
  or that poor advertisement regulations are somehow a multicultural thing ? 
  do we really need to limit african dance culture to twerking ? 
  comparing art on the basis of technical difficulty seems extremely narrow-minded . 
  that reminds me of khrushchev being angry at an avant-garde exposition . 
  do they call everything above the sea level a mountain there ? 
   the term kievan rus ' was created by weatern historians for a purpose . 
  you have to note that western historians tend to be unbiased , where the same ca n't always be said about russian historians , especially soviet ones . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  according to wikipedia , as well as google books ngram viewer ( which shows statistics of phrase usage in books ) , the term kievan rus ' dates back to russian historic books of the 19th century . 
  the first reference in english is of the early 20th century . 
  by the way , in soviet history books , `` kievan rus ' '' was the most widely used name for that country . 
   russia could comfortably be split into many states with at least 5-10-20 million inhabitants and a ton of natural resources on top of that does n't seem that simple . 
  inhabitants and natural resources tend to concentrate in different parts of russia . 
   written in russian i would n't call that russian . 
  it 's written in a mixture of old church slavonic and local spoken dialects . 
  it 's almost impossible to read scans of laurentian codex or any other close to original version ( btw , the original is lost ) without translation into modern russian or at least some adaptation . 
  kaliningrad oblast is missing in 1991 . 
  i 've been very surprised to find one souvenir shop in tallinn with tons of staff glorifying putin and russia . 
  it 's not like you have to choose only one of them . 
  having three systems seems better than having two . 
  how am i supposed to unsubscribe after it 's blocked ? 
  south american countries have a lot of visa free partnerships . 
  russia does n't . 
  there are not that many countries to which i can travel without a visa as a russian citizen , and similarly citizens of few countries can enter russia without a visa . 
  to be fair , statistics for the first 29 missions is a bit better for falcon 9 ( 2 +1 failures/partial failures vs 2 +2 ) , so they still can manage to achieve similar results in the long run . 
  strangely it does n't happen to me . 
  maybe , just maybe , it has something to do with what you write . 
   true , and thus belarus is hardly a good example of democracy and prosperity so is russia . 
   and even they are not russia-level despotic . 
  debatable . 
  lukashenko has been a president for 23 years already , it 's the only country in europe still having death penalty , recently they 've introduced a tax for being unemployed , they are constantly lower than russia in [ press freedom rating ] ( https://rsf.org/en/ranking/2016 ) , etc. 
  several years ago , there was no doubt that belarus was more authoritarian than russia . 
  however , russia has been gaining a lot of momentum in the recent few years , so now it 's quite hard to tell . 
   gee , i wonder why that happened . 
  what could have possibly motivated contractors to forego profit and not install equipment for an anti-government protest in russia ? 
  what a coincidence !, 
  likely they were pressured by the local authorities . 
   you do know it is only in russia that anti-government protests face that many nonsensical undemocratic bureaucratic obstacles selectively enforced only against them so as to obstruct any dissidence , right ? 
  compared to most of europe , yes , sure .

  we do n't even borders ( lol , if we would translate our troops to kaliningrad it would be noticed ), 
  your are nevertheless in eu , nato . 
  it is hard to protect themselves for the small counrty , especially in times , when russian empire was created . 
  now you have allied commitments and can be sure that nobody will injure you , in the past it did n't guarantee you this, 
  behavior of their majority causes this . 
  i do n't blame them ( it is stupid to blame people for their natural behavior ) , we need more control at the border and stricter migration rules, 
  anyway novgorod had different serious problems , because of the climat and poor soils maybe you are right but this despotism created the empire . 
  do n't think this is regrettable, 
  you just did n't see arkhangelsk http://cs630027.vk.me/v630027392/185ed/agxittie6fq.jpg, 
  russia 's too . 
  so what ? 
  okay we are not the first, 
  do n't think that it is important . 
  important to believe the west lies , to believe we do anything in law, 
  do we earn enough friendly points to annex somebody else ? 
  yes , free elective leaded by their coach ( not for this contest only , as i heard ), 
  i 'm studying at the same faculty that these guys, 
  did you read the defenition ? 
  i do n't want to justify anyone , i want to understand what the article says, 
  it can be the revenge on racial grounds . 
  it is diffrent from racism, 
  racism assumes dominance . 
  if it did by musim or black people , it is not correct to call it `` racism '', 
  why do n't leave people wave the flag against human rights ? 
  same reason, 
  we do n't pick anything , we are just forced to fight, 
  is it an only one a true view on the world ? 
  hmmm . 
  someone commented 5 of my commentaries, 
  lie about what ? 
  we need more levels, 
  all of our history we were behind in that, 
  they have russian coach  all that i know, 
  ni leader flag is also red , mb they are merge ? 
  mmm enough to look how eu refers to the various types of revolutions . 
  we do n't want to another one . 
  sufficient to divide on the small regions, 
  we do n't want to lost our country ? 
  like a ukraine, 
  funny that you ca n't find most of these article about russian agression on russian sites . 
  even on the opposition resources ( we have enough of them ) on the front page . 
  sure that nobody knows about it in my surroundings, 
  hockey invasion, 
  do you want to say it is not ? 
  did n't notice watermark, 
   the us 30 years ago was just as homophobic as russia is now . 
  but their society needed to fix that ( it was expressed in the human-rights activists ) . 
   fundamentally we 're pretty much the same people , regardless where we 're from . 
  sure it is completely not . 
  on every level . 
  `` special '' ? 
  you calls every not-europian civilization `` special '' ? 
  nice, 
  theory that it prevents crimea war, 
  occasion in georgia have different interpretations even in your press crimea is a base of the black sea fleet . 
  different people, 
  what for ? 
  each country has their own social progress . 
  and progress is to modernize national fundamental values for the present context . 
  when the usa legalized gay marriages in each state , it was their progress . 
  if russia would do that it would be something weird that does n't suppose to be . 
  common people that should be mobilized for so big war . 
  ( i am ~ ~ afraid ~ ~ forgot that you claims that nato would n't support baltic countries ) i think they would support , why not . 
  if it would indeed happens , it would be a much more danger agression that listed examples, 
  why do we need it ? 
  people can just refuse to war . 
  it would be hard for propaganda to justify such war . 
  do n't believe in social progress too . 
  but your position is clear, 
  only because of a reference to my flag . 
  any russian is wrong a-priory ? 
  second variant . 
  i have nothing against gays . 
  so what ? 
  is it disrespect to gays ? 
  do n't support it too, 
  because of the reference to the flag, 
  where did i disrespect somebody ? 
  i just only said my world view, 
  our financial elites keep money in europe . 
  they would n't allow to unleash the senseless war . 
  in addition , my fellow citizens not so aggressively tuned, 
   dictatorship of one opinion, 
  your are in nato , it will be suicide for us, 
  do n't believe in human rights , sorry . 
  you should have as much rights as your government gave it to you . 
  if it is not your and your countymans tradition , so change the government . 
  maybe the system , that is worked in the most civilized countries , the most efficient . 
  but imo it is silly to think that your can modernize in that way any country . 
  to force people to respect gay it is a violence, 
  it is a dictatorship of the one opinion . 
  as a right-wing , i do n't support it . 
  it is worthy of respect ? 
  they just please us and gb, 
  our opposition sucks because they are engaged unclear what . 
  instead of strengthen its position in the regions , they are fighting with putin ( war , which he does n't notice ) . 
  and do it with silly rusofobic ritorical , which ca n't convince anyone to support them ( even to hear ), 
  it always has matter . 
  it could not be saved from the crisis , but it could reduce losses . 
  not to mention the fact that the current authoritarian putin 's rule is on the basis of the yeltsin 's changes of constitution .

what a shame . 
  that 's why you should n't help us or nato . 
  ever . 
  why should they care ? 
  yes . 
  you should provide all sides or you 're engaging in propaganda . 
  my own backyard is perfect . 
  then eu must tell libya officials about it , give all the data and evidence . 
  and then libyan police will arrest smugglers . 
  but human rights are universal !, 
  and what about human rights and so on ? 
  and they still do n't have any chances to win . 
  they must cut all connections with all politician from 90s and declare all of them criminals . 
  money talks , bullshit walks . 
  those `` protestors '' just had too much money and free time . 
  i do n't want to touch that shit . 
  deal with it . 
  i ca n't vote for putin 's party because i do n't want to do it and never will . 
  i do n't want to vote for zhirinovsky because he 's a moron . 
  i ca n't vote for liberals because they still did n't break all ties with 90s scum and consider criminals like gaidar or yeltsin as good guys . 
  so i have only communists left . 
  oh , and i feel kinda guilty because i 've read propagandist paper '' \u041d\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u0439 \u0431\u043e\u0433 '' in 1996 and even trusted it . 
  if you 're from russia you know what i mean . 
  current communsits have nothing in common with soviet . 
  communists . 
  why ? 
  because fuck you , that 's why . 
  there is 3 possible ways : 1 . 
  europe will become failed state . 
  any kind of welfare will be removed . 
  return of nazi . 
  that is n't a reason to destabilize it more . 
  bandits there have a lot of us weapon and training . 
  sometimes authoritarian regimes are better than bandits . 
  there is no silver bullet . 
  if you had known it better then why would n't have you commanded that operation ? 
  you ca n't rescue hostages without wiping out the terrorists . 
  best show ever . 
  there are people who hate russans for historical reasons . 
  no , they did n't . 
  jeffrey d. sachs wrote about it here : http://jeffsachs.org/2012/03/what-i-did-in-russia/  to summarize a long saga succinctly , russia never received much in grant aid , stabilization support , [ 33 ] or debt relief . 
  what little did come was far too late to save the collapsing initial momentum of reforms , as most of the reformers were long gone from the scene or at least from the center of power . 
  a very senior u.s. official , lawrence eagleburger , told me bluntly in the spring of 1992 : `` jeffrey , you must understand . 
  assume for the sake of argument that i agree with you . 
  it does n't matter . 
  do you know what this year is ? 
  it 's an election year . 
  there will be no large-scale financial support . '' i had heard that before , many times indeed , in bolivia , poland , and elsewhere . 
  in those earlier cases , persistent persuasion had made a difference . 
  i did not take eagleburger 's statement at face value , though perhaps i should have done so . 
  he was , of course , proved accurate in subsequent events . 
  u.s. policy on aiding russia was indeed intransigent , and wrongheaded . 
   push democratization of russia this part will be really hard . 
  people have very bad memories from 90s . 
  chances to build liberal democracy in russia were destroyed by yeltsin in 1993 . 
  and he had full western support . 
  of course . 
  and almost all western actions in past 25 years confirm it . 
  and that 's why nobody will go against putin like in 1991 . 
  they can kiss my vpn . 
  not really . 
  right now regions are giving most of their own money to moscow . 
  and then moscow is giving some of them back . 
  and behave like it 's moscow 's money . 
  that 's the main problem here . 
  regions do n't want to leave russia . 
  they want their money back from moscow . 
  people do n't give a fuck about putin mostly . 
  they 're like `` putin ? 
  is he a president ? 
  ok , i support him . 
  now i have much more important things to do . 
  it 's better than chaos . 
  long time ago alchemy was a thing too . 
  but nobody take it serious now . 
  everything . 
  and that 's good . 
  communists did at least one really good thing : tried to destroy religion . 
  our clients are people who are paying for f2p games . 
  most of them in russia . 
  if they do n't have money they i wo n't have money too . 
  and so ? 
  i should prefer poverty in sake of what ? 
  nobody needed those planes despite they were faster than subsonic . 
  why somebody would need something even faster ? 
  i , my parents and almost everybody who i know were really poor for more than decade after ussr fall . 
  so yes , i 'll be grateful enough if i do n't need to care about food and place to sleep too much . 
   there have been dozens of examples of societies moving from dictatorship to democracies in 20th century i have seen one of them from inside during that transformation . 
  i prefer authoritarianism to that kind of `` democracy '' . 
  you ca n't eat ideas or freedom of press . 
  yes , two : concorde and tu-144 . 
  do n't play dumb please . 
  people with power and money will start fighting with each other for more power and money . 
  what else ? 
  if people will remove putin by some way then result will be the same as after ussr collapse . 
  lots of problems , total chaos , poverty and no help from anybody . 
  nobody wants that again . 
  there is no war where i live or at least in 2000 km from here . 
  why people should prefer total chaos that they still remember to relative stability ? 
  hypersonic jets are so xx century .

  nuclear warheads , aircraft and aircraft carriers and etc. 
  before becoming russian protectorate , which you asked for ( treaty of georgievsk , also `` forever with russia '' ) you were at constant war with turks and iran . 
   they also hate us . 
  actually not . 
  why would we hate you ? 
  for stalin ? 
   this exercise shows that it clearly is not actually , the reaction over the exercise shows that it is . 
  i understand that . 
  but ppp is the only way to take difference of salaries and costs into consideration . 
  $ 1000 can buy you very different amount of work and production in different countries . 
   gdp smaller than italy 's . 
  russian [ gdp ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.pp.cd/countries/1w?display=default ) according to world bank is bigger than german . 
  $ 3,623 bln vs $ 3,539 bln . 
   he 's crazy enough to pull a crimea on any eu countries the main thing it would n't work . 
  none of european countries have loyal ( to russia ) population . 
  why bringing up the past every time ? 
  at the time of molotov-ribbentrop pact poland invaded and occupied part of czekoslovakia . 
  the problem with hitler not that he invaded countries ( it was adequate to the period of history ) , but that he was a genocidal maniac that thought ( and acted ) like it was normal to eradicate whole nations to nonexistence . 
   wanting to purge us by nuclear fire . 
  never heard of that . 
  your media oversensationalize things . 
   there 's never going go be any neutrality . 
  you can be secured , but neutral , like finland . 
  do n't convert your land into military playground of offencive foreign alliences , that threaten the security of your neighbor . 
  it does n't give you more security , but draws a huge target instead . 
  and btw russia did n't occupy any nation after the dissolution . 
  abkhazia and ossetia are occupied with ethnic abkhazians and ossetians that do want to be independent , just research it . 
  the same with crimea . 
  why would we even need to occupy baltic people if they do n't want it ? 
  what we would do with them . 
  what do we gain except huge problems ? 
  it 's nonsence . 
  the real question - why did n't you live your peaceful neutral lifes after 1991 . 
  but what 's done is done . 
  you get confrontation when you seek it . 
   you do not attack nato . 
  and why is that ? 
  nato have n't defeated anyone . 
  poor sand people from underdeveloped countries does n't count . 
  the us is the only strong part of nato , but they wo n't start nuclear apocalypse over some minor issues . 
  reading comments like yours only convinces me that peacefull dissolution was a stupid move . 
  nobody appreciated it . 
  russians gave you independence , not the hilarious `` human chain '' and you continued to shit on us , instead of feeling the slightest gratitude . 
  the same with our `` brothers '' in ukraine . 
  so do n't be surprised we act the same way as you . 
  it reminds me of cromwell and the difference of his perception in england and ireland . 
  how many schoolbooks were written by nazis ? 
  he is percieved as a controversial figure which he really is . 
  [ 69 % ] ( http://www.levada.ru/31-03-2015/stalin-i-ego-rol-v-istorii-strany ) of russians are against renaming volgograd back to stalingrad , while it was a turning point of the war . 
  46 % ( majority ) think that stalin 's death is the end of terror and mass repressions . 
  only 7 % think that the `` great goals '' of stalin 's era definitely justify victims and suffering . 
  30 % respect him , but only 2 % admires , and only 7 % feels sympathy . 
  it also depends on the age and level of education . 
  more educated and young feel way less sympathetic to stalin . 
  germanics are more angular , slavs have rounder features . 
  a lot of actual little boys were killed by bombs . 
  they were busy shelling cities of donbass .

   but with some time we could 've done something .

  why ca n't canada have a referendum ?

  [ foreign operations appropriations law 101-513 ] ( https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/house-bill/5114 ) is a fact , though . 
  you said nato was only reacting to genocide ( ethnic cleansings ) . 
  but the fact is that the us was involved and promoted the dissolution before the actual balkan wars . 
  '' [ a year before the breakup ] ( http://www.iacenter.org/bosnia/origins.htm ) of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia , on nov. 5 , 1990 , the u.s. congress passed the 1991 foreign operations appropriations law 101-513 . 
  this bill was a signed death warrant .

  closer to 99 % , actually . 
  their education system is in russian . 
  culturally , in a context of history , poland is closer to western europe , because catholicism is a major connection factor . 
  and speaking of modern world , european countries are pretty unified . 
  the remaining factor is language . 
  what do you think of the czeck ? 
  they seem pretty western to me . 
  that 's an interesting intersection with [ y-dna map ] ( https://nonpundit.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/y-dna_haplogroups_europe_genetic_map.png ) . 
  so basically you consider western only european people with r1b markers . 
  but it 's even more interesting that both r1a and r1b genes came from russia . 
  `` r1a and r1b are the most common haplogroups in many european populations today , and our results suggest that they spread into europe from the east after 3,000 bce . 
  two hunter-gatherers from russia included in our study belonged to r1a ( karelia ) and r1b ( samara ) , the earliest documented ancient samples of either haplogroup discovered to date . '', 
  no , it should be in the united states .

  i often come across the point of view that the evolution is real but humans are the only ones who did n't evolve from other species .

  actually , no . 
  plants and cyanobacterias are responsible for the rapid ( in geological sense ) increase in atmospheric oxygen .

  judging by the impact it had on people , it should be called a genocide . 
  although , to what extent it was intentional or what initial intentions were - that is still debatable . 
  there 's a broad range of opinions on the topic : from `` a punishment for fighting for independence '' , then to `` the intentional ethnic cleansing of ukraine '' , after that to `` a lack of competence of the soviets , resulted in a wide-spread famine '' and from there to `` the rapid development of industry required more working hands , that 's why the soviets pushed country people to the cities and starved a surplus of peasants to death '' .

  there 're [ many different ethnic groups ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_groups_in_russia ) .

  i hope you 'll get an idea . 
  turks and caucasians are not my type , i 'm not quite aware of how they live here . 
  yes , it 's pretty common . 
  historically , people from the north have been more eager to marry each other , the same goes to southerners , due to the cultural differences . 
  however , it 's a fading trend . 
  muslim minorities are more traditional than others and tend to marry within their own religious / ethnic group . 
  it seems you 've already made up your mind in the matter . 
  every assimilated ethnicity had a significant impact on society , though to a less extent in case of the northern caucasus . 
  my guess is there are certain tensions between the different branches of the state security services . 
  not a war yet , of course , but a fight under the carpet .

  yeah , the do it all the time intentionally shelling residential areas with mortars and grads to put the blame on ukrainian army and win international sympathy . 
  hundreds of civilians were killed in these attacks already . 
  it 's sorta novel terrorist tactics , and it 's quite effective . 
  western press ( and hrw ) happily swallowed the bait and started their `` ukrainians indiscriminately use grads in civilian areas '' song .

  yes , absolutely no evidence , it seems that buks , tanks , grads , russian-only produced arms just materialized on the territory of ukraine out of nowhere .

  it 's neither neutral nor correct ( ` rebels ' arrived from a foreign country , controlled by a foreign country , armed by a foreign country , oh yeah ) .

  it was an accident that this particular boeing was shot down . 
  it was n't an accident that a civilian plane was shot down .

  read [ this tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/lugansk_today/status/483223304770453504 ) by @lugansk_today from june 29 :  idiots from the lnr fired from manpad on a flying over civilian plane kharkiv-tbilisi . 
  they shot near to the vnu [ east ukrainian volodymyr dahl national university ] and it was far from the only case . 
  it was a crime to give buks to these people . 
  what about operators of the buk -- of course , they were professionals . 
  also , separatists bragged about support from russian side after shooting down an-26 themselves -- that the target was `` lightened '' by radar on russian territory , and it was confirmed from ukrainian side . 
  putin gave to a bunch of murderous crazies a weapon of incredible power . 
  result -- rain of dead bodies of innocent people , like in breaking bad . 
  moreover , most likely the buk was operated by regular russian armed forces servicemen with support from russian army from russian territory under direct orders of russian government ( putin ) . 
  he is personally guilty in this murder . 
  oh , do n't worry about him . 
  he is directly responsible for far more deaths of innocent civilians . 
  it seems that people here do n't understand how bad these guys are . 
  strelkov 's people intentionally shelled residential areas of sloviansk , kramatorsk , luhansk , etc. , killing hundreds of civilians , it was and still is part of their tactics . 
  the only thing they are sorry in this incident -- that it has devastating effect for their image . 
   russia beyond the headlines is a news and information resource sponsored by the rossiyskaya gazeta publishing house . 
   rossiyskaya gazeta is the russian government 's official newspaper of record and provides the official publication of all laws and government decrees , for which it gets compensation from the federal budget . 
  seriously ? 
  so people upvote state sponsored russian propaganda in / r/europe nowadays ? 
  edit : according to the very same federal migration service , [ in march there were 1.6 million of ukrainian citizens on the territory of russia ] ( http://ria.ru/world/20140307/998661922.html ) . 
  according to the link , there are 1.8 m of them now . 
  how they got this 500 thousands figure ? 
  _ some _ acts of _ some _ maidan protesters were borderline terrorist , e.g. 
  like arson against the office of the party of regions . 
  acts of the thugs on donbass are terroristic by a mile . 
   i 'm guessing they just go underground and radicalise . 
  it will not happen . 
  age of 2/3 of people who vote for communist party of ukraine is higher than 50 years , almost half is older than 60 years . 
  they would not radicalize or go underground ( well , ... ) . 
  also , there is a _ huge _ difference between communism and parties like communist party of ukraine or communist party of russian federation . 
   former communists former members of communist party . 
  it 's not enforced however , they have former members of communist party . 
   yes of course . 
  you may be interested in the dictionary definitions of `` racism '' and `` xenophobia '' then . 
   deputies from the parliament are elected . 
  sure , just like svoboda mps . 
   so you do n't agree they 're racist and xenophobic , as claimed , despite what i just quoted from their official website , disciminating against e.g. , atheists and communists . 
  huh , are you even serious ? 
  anti-communist and religious party does n't accept communists and atheists as its members , and you consider it an example of `` racism and xenophobia '' ? 
  yes , words have all kind of meanings . 
  for example , they have legal meanings . 
  for example , in ukraine `` terrorism '' is defined by [ article 258 of the criminal code ] ( http://kodeksy.com.ua/ka/ugolovnyj_kodeks_ukraini/statja-258.htm ) . 
  google translate :  the terrorist act , the use of a weapon , an explosion , arson or other acts that endanger human life or health , or cause significant property damage or other grave consequences if such acts are committed for the purpose of violating public security , intimidating the population , provoking a military conflict , international complications , or to influence the decision or act or omission of action by state or local governments , officials of these bodies , associations of citizens , legal persons , or to draw public attention to certain political , religious or other views culprit ( terrorist ) russia and other countries have similar definitions . 
  it 's cool that you have your own definitions of words , but it does n't mean that words suddenly lost their meanings because of that . 
  your comment where you blame svoboda for hate speech -- try to find an example of real hate speech on their site . 
  and of course the eu parliament ( some strange organ that 's filled with all kind of nazis itself ) resolution . 
  oh , not again this svoboda nonsense . 
  * attacks on civilian objects on their own territory to blame ukrainian army . 
  sounds crazy , but that 's what they actually do -- at first in sloviansk and kramatorsk , now ( since the flight of separatists from sloviansk ) [ in luhansk ] ( http://www.citynews.net.ua/news/35050-ubivshaya-8-iyulya-v-luganske-passazhirov-marshrutki-mina-byla-vypuschena-terroristami-a-ne-ukrainskoy-armiey.html ) . 
  dozens civilians ( maybe even up to a few hundreds ) were killed in these pointless false flag attacks . 
  * random killings , kidnappings for ransom , etc. 
  often for minor reasons or no reason at all . 
  10 month old kid was killed in antratsyt from a grenade launcher , person was killed in luhansk ( if i remember correctly ) for recording separatists on his phone , 3 road police officers were killed in donetsk few days ago , and so on -- on the territory controlled by separatists that happens daily . 
  * intimidation ( kidnapping , beating , etc. ), 
  of people who do n't share their views . 
  two popular pro-ukrainian microbloggers were identified by separatists and forced to close their twitter accounts yesterday . 
  if you wear ukrainian symbolics , you are going to have bad time . 
  * sabotage on the railroad , blowing up bridges , damaging railways , other destruction of infrastructure , etc. 
  yes , they are terrorists .

  i 'm yours to command . 
   false equivalence is a logical fallacy which describes a situation where there is a logical and apparent equivalence , but when in fact there is none . 
  it would be the antonym of the mathematical concept of material equivalence . 
   whataboutism is a term for the tu quoque logical fallacy popularized by the economist for describing the use of the fallacy by the soviet union in its dealings with the western world during the cold war . 
  the tactic was used when criticisms were leveled at the soviet union , wherein the response would be `` what about ... '' followed by the naming of an event in the western world loosely similar to the original item of criticism . 
  it represents a case of tu quoque or the appeal to hypocrisy , a logical fallacy which attempts to discredit the opponent 's position by asserting the opponent 's failure to act consistently in accordance with that position , without directly refuting or disproving the opponent 's initial argument . 
  yup . 
  i know the meanings of these words . 
   but i 'm sure you can prove me wrong . 
  sure , i can . 
  the journalist was killed in the provocation staged by separatists , read [ the article in russian forbes ] ( http://www.forbes.ru/sobytiya/obshchestvo/261363-pozyvnoi-gyurza-kto-podstavil-zhurnalistov-pod-puli-v-donetske ) of another russian journalist who was there during the clash ( in russian ) . 
  itt : whataboutism and false equivalences .

  in the first video he 's asking some : `` so you are a fascist ? '', 
  ( ~ 2007 ) , in the second is a squabble between chechen and dagestan wrestler fans ( which also happens at many sports events regulary ) . 
  third is a fight between football players ( the teams there are absolutely international ) , omg . 
  the forth it 's even written there : 1 ) no civilians involved ; 2 ) no casualities ; 3 ) the conflict was n't about ` national hatred ' . 
  you , boy , visit at least one football game in your life , not to mention serve in the army , to know what life means , instead of watching old videos on youtube :d that 's all you can do , to send me 4 outdated as hell videos for the 145 mln . 
  country ? 
  you need a dramatic update of your life . 
  you are n't an interesting interlocutor , hence it 's time to leave you . 
  ' 08 , ' 13 , good cnn ; where are good for you early '90s ? 
  you need to update yourself dramatically . 
  no wonder . 
  except for being quoted on cnn & co. it has never and nowhere been popular . 
  it follows the fate of dozhd ' , a good media who used to be good on the internet and also providing cnn & co. with good materials , but then reduced itself to a ` paid subscription only ' , selling caps with own logo for a year or so , before such a dramatic decision was made . 
  it 's a great catholic achievement !, 
   these statistics run against the kremlin 's triumphalist narrative , in which strong leadership and shrewd investments allowed russia to decisively turn a demographic corner . 
  it does n't run against ; for the last four years it looks like +30 k. , +30 k. , +30 k. , -3 k. . ( after being like -150 k , -200 k. , -550 k. 
  respectively back ) calculate it yourself . 
  you are one of the `` degraded & low quality so-called ` minorities ' in the eu '' demanding some `` crooked worship '' ? 
  thanks . 
  but somehow i could n't care less , you know , naverstivay dalshe wherever you nest in :d, 
  \u033f\u033f \u033f\u033f \u033f\u033f \u033f ' \u033f ' \\ \u0335\u0347\u033f\u033f \\ \u0437 = ( \u2580 \u035c\u035e\u0296 \u2580 ) = \u03b5 / \u0335\u0347\u033f\u033f / ' \u033f ' \u033f \u033f \u033f\u033f \u033f\u033f \u033f\u033f chechens also build well - work as construction workers - and even have auto industry established - take a look at `` chechen auto '' - https://vk.com/album-101373101_242427429 ( or re-established , not sure about whether it existed there since the ussr times ) , besides ordinary russia 's lada models they make there . 
  agrocultural/food stuff and energy/chemistry facilities are also there . 
   i mean , there are also chechens fighting for the ukraine , and unlike kadyrov people , they 're there by their own will and not for the money . 
  do n't think that a ukrainian is stupid enough to not see things in the rf either . 
  well , there are bastards everywhere , no doubts , ca . 
  10 k. of russians ( russian-speaking , from the former-ussr altogether who also have visa-free with russia ) are fighting for is in syria ( have been fighting , now obviously their number is significantly reduced ) , various jihadi-toliks and such scum . 
  `` chechens fighting for the ukraine '' are the run-away terrorists from the `` is '' once having a hold on the russian soil in chechenya with all the `` sharia '' stuff and so on , since they were defeated some of them ran away in bad pain to europe mainly ( to where else ?!, 
  bad russia , persectution , bear , bomba , stalin , give me a refugee status , i am the `` freedom fighter '' ; not only such chechens are in europe surely , many ran away just from the very fact of the war and destruction , and many also from those very terrorirsts ) , and from then on , some of the most pained are trying to oppose russia . 
  also , `` not for money '' is a bit of exageration too , especially regarding the `` good qatari/saudi/turkey funding of the freedom fight in chechenya '' which instantly ceased once the funding lines were cut . 
   and unlike kadyrov people what unlike kadurov people ? 
  fighting for money ? 
  you know , they 'd make some money out of you for such words once heard in real , i think . 
   it 's just , weird . 
  no , it 's just pathetic - they are still stuck in the outdated paradigm of their good saudi/qatari sponsors of early '90s in their desperate hope to sew feud and nationalism in russia/caucasus - and also perfectly illustrating their intellectual and other capabilities , what they generally are worth and what they `` see '' ( being totally blind , putting it mildly , with their brains too mild , melted down ) . 
  and a big pain as a result of it all leads them to such `` weird & absurd madness '' like that helpless comment full of spite and wishful illusions . 
  i have explained the situation as a whole so to speak , in details . 
  on the contrary : whatever makes math happy , - regarding the majority of the people , i underline this , - and maybe even including these tiny farmers who can afterwards get hired to those big farms and earn 10 times more than if they were doing it on their own in an inept way . 
  basic common sense and pragmatism instead of crooked worship of degraded & low quality so-called ` minorities ' as in the eu . 
  read the russia 's constitution or at least some wiki :  chapter 1 . 
  the fundamentals of the constitutional system  article 1  the russian federation - russia is a democratic federal law-bound state with a republican form of government . 
   ** the names `` russian federation '' and `` russia '' shall be equal . 
  no , only on the internet ( the foreign segment of it ) by such random pained persons , it 's highly likely a terrorist or a pained ukrainian - even much more insane things one can hear from them , as they are n't really in touch with realities because of their poor education , pain , fears , and such things , they need an urgent & dramatic update of themselves from early '90s - are lagging behind for a couple of decades . 
  it happens all over the world . 
  for everyone , who are not those certain 20 small farmers . 
  first of all for big farmers ( big bussiness , of course ) but also for everyone else through taxes and jobs . 
  it 's optimisation of efficiency , which - just as anything else - never lets absolutely everyone be pleased . 
  there are no `` wheat-oligarchs '' in russia , it 's not really a field to become an oligrach , ask poland . 
  big farmers taking lands from small farmers using certain legislation tricks , is not really a big deal . 
  it happens . 
  russia has become the first wheat exporter in the world 2015 , remained that in 2016 and grows the volumes in 2017 , plus incredible rise in other agricultural positions . 
  so , for russia as a whole it must be good all in all . 
   why anybody should be afraid ? 
  hm , not anybody , but you . 
  ask yourself this question as you are obviously too afraid to visit it and to see : it 's really russia , a really great region of russia , - only you can know it why you are so afraid , i have no idea . 
  maybe because you are n't russian ( nor chechen ) ? 
  oh , i see , you post a lot at r/siryancivilwar , prolly you 're so much pained by the russian ( and in particular certain chechen ) units acting in syria ? 
  many terrorists are pained by this , so you are n't alone in this ` grief ' , do n't be sad . 
  the russian psyche includes helping own people , not only using them as slaves , trading them or whatever else of that kind . 
  truth and justice over any laws and money , that 's exactly what russian psyche and culture are , that 's why the west is so shocked and helpless in the realms which go beyond its very narrow narrotive . 
  when you follow the ** real ** and ** worth it ** needs of your people instead of viewing your and any other people as a trading matter , geopolitics and all the rest go well and just perfect , naturally . 
  it 's a tiny region of russia , open the map or better just visit if you are n't afraid of course . 
  belorussia does n't !, 
  :d and this year russia did not prolong something there or so , does n't care about it , for a long time already . 
  formally in , but actually does n't care . 
  two or three years ago adopted certain amendments giving the decisions of the state court priority over the european court decisions , then did n't pay some fees , and also does n't prolong something . 
  i did . 
  and you seemingly did n't finish it ? 
   the council of europe urged it to be adopted by other european organisations , and in 1985 the european communities ( ec ) adopted it . 
  that 's where it starts and where it ends :d vague !, 
  does n't coincide with geography , realities and basically with common sense . 
  who the hell cares what the eu ( and all its councils together with communities ) `` adopted '' , `` designed '' or `` urged '' there , except for the eu of course , who obviously cares . 
   the eu flag is the flag of europe , not just the eu but the whole of europe who told you such a funny thing ? 
   the flag of europe , or european flag is an official symbol of two separate organisations -- the council of europe ( coe ) and the european union ( eu ) . 
   the flag was designed in 1955 , and officially launched later that year by the council of europe as a symbol for the whole of europe . 
  the council of europe urged it to be adopted by other european organisations , and in 1985 the european communities ( ec ) adopted it . 
   lol you think i 'm a ukrainian nationalist . 
  first of all i see that you are poorly educated , that 's the point !, 
   like really dude , you do n't know what a nationalist is . 
  you seem to know it well . 
  enjoy . 
   i 'm from xar ` kov . 
  did you come to there from rural galicia in a permanent traditional search for jobs ? 
   also the whole debacle going on in ukraine makes for a opportune time for putin to take crimea with less backlash . 
  and a `` pro-russian '' ( in what way was he pro-russian ? ), 
  president was a poorer `` opportunity '' promising more backlash ? 
   no , and i never said that . 
  i am asking you , following your crooked logic . 
  russia decided to listen to crimean people 's cry for the reunification only when their lives were in real danger . 
  learn your history ( not the one in which you are convincing yourself of preposterous things like you were the ones who excavated the black sea and taught egyptian pharaons ukranian mova , but a normal one , a real ) , galicia , make an investigation of the struggle of crimean people for independence from ukraine which has a solid history from the very 1992 . 
  all the rest is just too incoherent to even comment on . 
  exactly !, 
  but all in all the same . 
  a withdrawal . 
  and finally an independence . 
  in those times - from the burden of the american colonies , now - from the vague eu . 
  democratic peaceful decision is also a great favorable condition !, 
  that 's quite shady !, 
   if i jump off a skyscraper wrong premise , wrong example . 
  in such a case even this low energy fakenews would n't have such a wording as `` could be '' , would n't make such a vague random phrase ( tweet ) a news , as well as any more-or-less serious person ( that is - having something more-or-less serious to say ) would n't put it in this way `` in possible branches of the future '' . 
  that 's just pain ... and an entire factual mistake .

  smaller country , less ethnic diversity , a lot more monetary injections , different economic culture . 
  in the end , a very different situation . 
  western propaganda was supportive of chechen islamists , that much is certain , the whole `` freedom fighter '' buzzword and all . 
  the cause of the conflict is centuries old , it 's not like the west created it , but it did add fuel to the fire . 
  putin is friendly with new oligarchs , people who gained their wealth at the end of , or after , the 90s . 
  some 90s oligarchs , like abramovich , fell in line with putin and spent some of their wealth on developing russia and were let off the hook in the end . 
  others , like khodorkovsky opposed putin , and ended up losing everything . 
  mal for president !, 
  well , brexit and trump were always gon na be a close call , but i think fillon is a pretty solid outcome , unless something drastic happens . 
  why ? 
  communicating with both china and taiwan is a right step forward , perhaps it will even lead to some sort of a diplomatic solution for their differences , or at least encourage it . 
  i am happy with any candidate who wants to improve relations with russia , things can only get better with cooperation . 
  he has my vote !, 
  le pen has little chance of winning . 
  france is set to go fillon at this stage , without any russian backing . 
  you got ta remember that aleppo was always mostly pro government , the rebels who took aleppo were not locals . 
  being a russian nationalist , navalny does not support crimea returning to ukraine . 
  thanks , taras . 
   occupied russian soldiers there are by agreement with moldova : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joint_control_commission, 
  i think people are just so desensitised to propaganda , they see right through rfe . 
  best propaganda is based on truth , it might be exaggerated , but it 's still there somewhere . 
  rfe does n't have that foundation of truth , so it 's quite shaky . 
  my opinion though , i just do n't think such an experienced organisation can be so incompetent . 
  oh , i agree , i think it 's a great shame that russia does not do the same with prednistrovye and south ossetia . 
  i guess those two are more or less stable , so allowing them to join now would rock the boat and cause more instability , it should have been done when the conflicts were first heated up , but russia had enough problems of its own back then . 
  heh , radio free europe has been running propaganda against ussr and then russia for the past half a century iirc , you 'd expect them to be very skilled at doing what they do by now . 
  it ca n't just be incompetence that it 's failing miserably , surely there 's a different reason for that , wonder what that might be . 
  do you actually believe that russia is planning a war in eastern europe ? 
  like , with full honesty and a cool head , you think that 's the plan ? 
  feel free to hack some russian politicians then and set up western media in russia . 
  but western media has been in russia for decades now , so it 's pretty even , no ? 
  see how effective it proves , you never know . 
  why are you lumping all the regions with completely different circumstances into one ? 
  russian peacekeepers in prednistrovye and south ossetia are there by agreement with moldova and georgia , they are joint commissions . 
  chechnya is a part of russia and russian forces in syria are there on request from the government . 
  ukraine is complicated , but probably the only one from the list on which you have a point . 
  you have a fair point , i 'd disagree on kosovo , because i think the two situations are comparable on legal grounds , but apart from that , yeah , perhaps . 
  but while all that may be true , crimeans still overwhelmingly made their choice , so what do you do , disrespect the wishes of 2 million people or bend soft law to your cause , much like soft law often is . 
  no , of course it would n't . 
  i highly doubt there would even be a chance of that happening . 
  chechnya would not agree to that , and russia would n't allow it to happen . 
  just to confirm , is your position that the referendum was invalid because of how it happened , or that the majority of crimeans did not want to join russia ? 
  97 % is not really surprising since a lot of people who would have voted no boycotted the referendum altogether . 
  pew and gallup polls both found over 80 % of crimeans happy with the referendum results : http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/05/08/despite-concerns-about-governance-ukrainians-want-to-remain-one-country/pg-2014-05-08-ukraine-russia-1-02/ http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/20/one-year-after-russia-annexed-crimea-locals-prefer-moscow-to-kiev/#3c0845795951, 
  the west sponsored candidates in russia get like 1 % vote , do n't think declaring anything is necessary . 
  also , i love it how every time i see your posts , you are encouraging a war with russia . 
  / r/russia would like to encourage all sides to keep calm and uphold peace . 
  to show our commitment to peace , we hereby sign a non aggression pact with / r/de .

  jihadists , on the other hand , have these kinds of hospitals : https://np.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/5gp77k/footage_from_inside_of_aleppo_national_hospital/,

  saakashvili estimated it at 20 years . 
  crazy that ussr had to withstand pretty much the whole of europe back then . 
  soviet union definitely brought more equality to everyone , including ethnic equality . 
  most leaders of ussr were not ethnic russians , interestingly . 
  russian empire was a lot more nationalistic than ussr . 
  funnily enough , a large number of bolsheviks were jewish , plenty of jewish chekists as well . 
  ussr was the first country to legally recognise the state of israel . 
  it was n't until stalin started getting more and more paranoid and israel was warring with arabs that relations deteriorated . 
  you can buy good cheese in russia .

  well fuck , do n't buy the cheapest cheese you can find . 
  abkhazia is a sovereign state actually , the title is sensationalist . 
  they were in real life though , not on paper . 
  completely independent from georgia . 
  it 's not georgia 's territory , they split off from ussr , south ossetia split off from them , that 's how nations form . 
  what does that have to do with georgia starting the war ? 
  they have been living as independent since early 90s . 
  they were independent in the practical sense , in the real world . 
  russia only recognised them after the war . 
  georgia 's escalation was completely unjustified , it was a land grab . 
  the regions have been independent since early 90s bro , putin was chillin somewhere back then . 
  and throughout the years , there were shots fired in both directions . 
  georgian forces moved in to recapture south ossetia in 2008 because saakashvili got a big head and thought he was a conqueror for a second , went bad for him . 
  eu mission accepted the truth that georgia started the war . 
  you should too . 
  derailing like a ukrainian champ , 
  it 's pretty funny though . 
  the war started when georgia invaded , before that there were small exchanges of fire since the war was over in 1992 , nothing to warrant a full scale war . 
  russia had no troops in the area apart from the agreed upon peacekeeping troops , who came under fire from georgia and some were killed . 
  it took russia 2 days to get enough troops in to equal to georgia 's forces , at which point the tide turned and georgia was pushed back .

  i want her to be my wife .

  when i say that franco does n't deserve desecration , they say `` yeah , what about putin , you bastard ? '', 
  it seems , i really must not think about franco . 
  it is like a crime . 
  no one good man would ever do . 
  no way .

  you could , for example end a neutrality pact and it would n't have consequences . 
   the japanese were willing to accept peace , and the americans and british were willing to enter into peace talks , but the ussr continued to stall them . 
  men , you are making shit up . 
  go read at least some book about that period . 
   defend everything but a ** small path straight to the german border ** . 
  * poland ?!, 
   pew found that 61 per cent of russians believe there are parts of neighbouring countries that rightfully belong to russia . 
  would it be at least relieving for you , if i say that nobody wants a piece of poland ? 
   with this logic , one could argue `` yeah , the holocaust was bad , but hey at least they did n't kill all the jews '' . 
  are you seriously comparing genocide and taking over 4 small islands that were disputed since xviii century ? 
   no , it was his agreement to the terms of the yalta conference which were in direct opposition to international law that make the ussr 's involvement in the pacific theater illegal . 
  international law , what that international law you are talking about in august 1945 ? 
   that 's why the usa wished to finish the war with japan as soon as possible before the soviets could get involved . 
  what ? 
  have you read at least one book involving that period of time ? 
  soviet union was forced to be involved by usa . 
  usa provided landing operation ships that soviet union just lacked in the pacific . 
   furthermore are you implying that the allies and the japanese should be grateful to the ussr that they only took those territories ? 
  how psychotic is that ?!, 
  why is that psychotic ? 
  japan was the aggressor in the war which attack soviet union allies ( uk and us ) . 
  also japan in 1905 against all pacts and without declaration of war attacked russian empire took kurils and sakhalin massacring local population . 
  also the victory would be impossible without soviet union operation in china , as i told you japan lost around 1/3 of it 's army in just a week . 
  but not just army , the strategic region and their lines of supplies . 
  probably without that defeat us would keep bombing them with nukes for some time before they would surrender because of that . 
   today most russians see the islands as retribution for the war with japan , even though this was an offensive war the ussr declared retribution for 1905 , i 'd say . 
   ah yes , because persecution and genocide is ok as long as its in your own country . 
  you must really look up to stalin . 
  are you talking about the genocide of ainu people by the japanese ? 
   his acquiescence at yalta was therefore invalid . 
  it is not acquiescence at yalta , is is acquiescence under japanese capitulation act . 
   furthermore , the soviets were definitely interested in taking land . 
  stalin could have taken hokkaido , nobody would have blinked an eye . 
  usa were the ones who gave soviet union the ships for the land operation in enough quantity to take all of japan . 
   after occupation of the islands , the ussr went further with the illegal actions of deport all the residents there , not only japanese colonists abut also the indigenous people who made those islands their home for over a 1000 years . 
  very bad , should have taken hokkaido after all and created ainu ssr . 
   i do n't think estonia is hated . 
  there is also hated and `` hated '' . 
  if we are talking about real hated , then maybe russia would be the only country by far which is hated by some in / r/europe . 
   does germoney hate belgium or luxembourg ? 
  i consider that / r/europe has some class . 
  so people usually think before shit-talking about their neighbours . 
  while i frequent / pol / and know more or less what people would say if not contained by some limits . 
   well , the day when the ussr seized the islands was when they themselves broke the treaty of non-aggression with japan and invaded , hoping for a quick land grab before the evil ` muricans could have it all . 
  soviet union prepared not a land grab , but full-scale invasion of japanese territory under what was agreed in yalta . 
  and su offensive was probably the main reason why japan surrendered : see defeat of kwantung army and landing operations in sakhalin and kurils . 
  with joint effort of red army ( su and chinese communists ) japan lost between 1/4 and 1/3 of it army in just a week . 
  in any case it is not relevant for the modern international law . 
   but i for one would strongly suggest japan receiving these islands so they may be actually developed into a 1st world standard of living rather than be a russian ego-boost . 
  it 's too late for that now . 
  but `` they launder money/help in taxation for our corrupt politicians and crooks '' circlejerk would disagree . 
  eesti is hated by snobbish nordics , nationalist russians and quietly by other baltic states . 
  iceland geographically is not in europe . 
  big strong countries - are hated because of the history of aggression and oppression of their neighbours . 
  small irrelevant countries - are hated by their neighbours or ex-oppressors because of territorial claims . 
  microstates - are hated because of their money laundering . 
  northerners are hated because they are snobs . 
  southerners are hated because they are lazy . 
  easterners are hated because of their backwardness . 
  westerners are hated because of their egginess . 
  i 'd say slovenia is the least hated . 
  japan has no claim under 1855 treaty because they themselves broke it in 1905 atacking and annexing islands that under that treaty were part of russian empire . 
  they also accepted unconditional surrender after ww2 , meaning that they have no legal grounds for such claim whatsoever . 
  during cold war soviet union purposed to give 2 islands back in exchange for complete us military forces removal from japan . 
  they denied it . 
  right now those islans are part of russian federation , but japan under it 's revisionists policies insists in retriving them . 
  it may not end well . 
  at least we did n't have to sell it , 
  i know , ukrainian govenrment has [ blocked the canal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjyrld_onwg ) of fresh water from river dnieper to crimea , and i have seen it barely mentioned . 
  do n't worry , money is being poured . 
  meh , soviet nightvision devices always were a decade behind , so more than probable , that for initial tests and prototypes western devices will be used . 
  could you point out the story twisting lines from the rt article in this case ? 
  wow , so many downvotes . 
   mfw russian tries to always bring up the usa as some ridiculous justification for bullshit behaviour . 
  erm ... it were the baltic states who took away rights of russian minority in the 90 's . 
  so again how this is our bullshit behaviour ? 
  yes , i suppose it is the same as in russia . 
  muslim tatars lived with us for the last 500 years . 
  mostly no problems in recent time . 
  caucasus muslims - were conquered by russia 200 years ago but keep trying to pull the same shit because of which they were invaded in first place : [ slavery ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/slaves-russia-dagestan-brick-factories-escape ) , [ kidnappings ] ( http://womennewsnetwork.net/2015/01/14/truth-about-bride-kidnapping/ ) and robbery . 
   the perception of grave injustice was a product of russian-speaking mass media mfw live in dallas , usa . 
  mfw pro-mexican group wins the elections mfw texas quits usa mfw when only spanish-speaking population get to be citizens , while all ` gringo ' become second-class humans who are invited to leave and go north . 
   yes , it 's terrible here , that 's why almost nobody leaves from estonia to russia every year and about a 1000 russians immigrate to estonia every year . 
  90 's , 90 's , 90 's , 90 's , 90 's , 90 's , 90 's , 90 's ...  estonia and estonian people have nothing to answer for , russia on the other hand yes , now i clearly see why those people i talked about hate estonia . 
  it is an argument of reductio ad absurdum . 
  russian 's civil rights in baltic states ( latvia and estonia ) were infringed and many were cleansed based on ethnicity . 
  just in a not violent way . 
  people like you are trying to justify that , but there is not justification . 
  just accept it and move on . 
   calling it discrimination is disingenuous and they got passports , but not citizenship . 
  passports of non-citizens . 
  you know , like jews a golden star . 
   they 're not celebrating the nazis , they 're celebrating people who fought for latvian freedom against soviet union . 
  there are no nazi salutes , or swastikas or anything present , it 's a lie spinned by russian propaganda . 
  precisely my point . 
  people who killed russians , jews , suppressed rebellions in other regions occupied by nazis and was used as cannon meat during siege of leningrad -- are now heroes who fought for latvia . 
  people who fought against those ` heroes ' are war criminals . 
   well , russian people should have other things to worry about , but the propaganda never stops see , commentaries like yours make the problem snowball even further . 
  you can spin the story however you like . 
  it is people with your narrative and conduct who are causing , like strukkstar said : '' * russia to have such a problem with estonia * '' .

  what exactly he destroyed, 
   around 15k from 250k . 
  only those who deserted, 
  we are haunted by a ghost , the ghost of communism, 
  just to make you sure that you are bad in cycling, 
  why ? 
  what 's wrong with him ? 
  what will changed ? 
  nah , facebook is horrible, 
  i found [ this ] ( https://vk.com/live_ukr ) page . 
  propably this site under foreign occupation . 
  we should close it, 
  show me russian propaganda on banned sites, 
  when you and your friends are the only power in the world , all of your actions would be legal, 
  for the 20 years the usa was way more agressive than we . 
  nobody cared about it . 
  do n't prevent us from expanding our zone of influence , you wanted to say, 
  eltsin , then putin , then medvedev tried to imrpove relations with west . 
  what did we received in exchange ? 
  all of eastern europe in nato , west leaders support russophobic laws and arrange revolutions near our borders, 
  good relations ca n't exist without mutual respect . 
  russia tried a lot , but it was always one-sided will, 
  it 's like `` do n't mistake putin and united russia for russia '', 
  the most stupid thing that eu should do now - to quarrel with its members, 
   edv\u012bns \u0160nore ( born 21 march 1974 , in saulkrasti ) is a latvian film director and politician . 
  very unbiased view . 
  consume this shit if you want, 
  just repeat `` russia '' and things will change for your will, 
   the maidan popular movement thus began . 
  yanukovych , urged on by putin , quelled the uprising with brutal violence , which left more than 100 dead in the streets of kiev . 
  every day you learn something new on r/europe, 
  actually ukraine started this war, 
  shock, 
   shit what do you prefer ? 
  i tried to use fb ... and i 'm not sure, 
  you are so funny guys , maybe at least check what is banned, 
  28 million people from ukraine are registered in vk . 
  1.3 million are currently online ( almost the same % as for russia ), 
  sometimes rt is the only source that can qualitatively translate some important local news, 
  [ this is ] ( https://vk.com/live_ukr?w=wall-55297091_1026358 ) how directly control looks like, 
  so important information . 
  do n't know how our military will live without it . 
  i doubt that posts that are currently on the bottom of page are downvoted . 
  for new posts the script is different here , i suppose, 
   wow , they downvoted you to oblivion in like a blink of an eye . 
  how do you know it ? 
  rt in banned on r/europe , nobody find it wrong, 
  they ban an resourse , not a possibilty to expess some opinions, 
  what does it mean `` controlled by kremlin '' . 
  the have some influence on it , yes . 
  but you still can find here groups like [ this ] ( https://vk.com/live_ukr ), 
  who cares about these blocks - it is easy to get round them, 
  5 $ is really cheap even for us . 
  if we talk about decent hairdresser, 
  swiss flag always triggers me, 
  really ? 
  it reminds me either flag of extremist organisation or flag of african country . 
  red + black looks very agressive, 
  union jack , for sure finnish and estonian are awesome too, 
  how did he ruin it ? 
  ~ 50 % were against brexit . 
  it is far from `` no support '', 
  in vain did you write it here, 
  so you do n't ask me anything , you just want to tell all us about how much you hate the ussr . 
  keep in touch, 
  because it is funny that 10-15k protests get 1000 upvotes here, 
   do n't you think russia should abandon the usage of communist symbols nowadays i would be really ashamed of this . 
  i 'm not a communist and i think that communism did n't bring russia anything good . 
  but ussr period is still our history , still something that our ancestors built and it should n't be forgotten . 
  if my country will do this , i would stop consider myself as russian and would n't care about anything that is going on here . 
  this country would be dead for me, 
  why do you care, 
  ok thanks , i 'll delete, 
  propably 59 %, 
  is it ok to show russian signs ? 
  i do n't know , maybe it is already forbidden too, 
  upvoted, 
  most russians that i see on this sub can only apologize for their stupid countrymates, 
  why belarus is red . 
  i understand nothing, 
  so stupid, 
   and let 's be frank , we can all name a number of very active users with ru-flair that are far from being friendly to europe and/or ukraine it is more of a myth . 
  serbia can not into eu, 
   how many times it ruled in favor of the russian opposition ( e.g. 
  navalny ) and the russian government basically ignored it ? 
  zero times ? 
  russia fulfills all the requirements of the european court, 
  i can say that `` similar laws to russia '' means nothing , cos problems in russia not with laws , but with its implementation, 
   sometimes nicknamed parasha very quality article, 
  not many . 
  currently he has 320k abstracting from the incident , he is pretty dull schoolchildren-orientated `` cynical '' blogger . 
  and what did you do to stop this war ? 
  the only side that does n't accept negotiations is ukraine, 
  and after that people here talk something about stupid putin trolles, 
  http://usa.mfa.gov.ua/en/legal_aspects downvote yourself, 
  where did you find propaganda, 
  what, 
   georgia triggered, 
  okay maybe it will help ... in 20 years, 
  minor benefit .

  and now i feel exhausted . 
  apathetic . 
  40 people died here , 100 people died there , a truck , a suicide bomber , a fucking machinegunner , 300 dead in iraq , you soulless racist scum , a psycho with a daddy 's .45 , cannibals , 20 beheaded students are found in mexico . 
  the popular blogger is torn to pieces in bangladesh . 
  whatever . 
  turkey 'll be ready soon , you just need to endure some spain of time . 
   contestants will each sign a waiver acknowledging that they might be raped or killed but the rules also state that police are free to arrest anyone who commits a crime on the show . 
  `` you must understand that the police will come and take you away , '' the rules state . 
  it just has no sense . 
  i am already allowed to rape and murder anywhere with the condition that the police will come and take me away . 
   because here he will not get justice vigilantism, 
  no , no , it is de jure allowed as it is written in the constitution , but suspended because russia is a member of council of europe . 
  it can only be used when russia leaves the council of europe , there 's nothing in the constitution about banning death penalty . 
  why do you think he is a cocaine dealer ? 
  done . 
   or are you just projecting because life sucks in siperia ? 
  yeah , we all suffer here and dream about moving to gulpia . 
  someone stole my phone . 
  i silently looked into his life for weeks and started to feel sympathy to him and guilt about what i did . 
  i made an anonymous payment to him . 
  when he disconnected , i visited his home , he looked at me about two seconds and he was hairy and smelling . 
  i said nothing and left out to not make him worried . 
  the end . 
  i think , this film can get its popularity in finland . 
   in what sense is this not a genocide ? 
  in that sense there is no such an ethnicity - kulak . 
  a kulak is a peasant rich enough to hire additional labourers for his farm . 
  in this sense the progressive scale of taxes can be called genocide . 
  does it target specific group of people ? 
  of course , it does . 
  and the most of them are jews !, 
  damn you , france , how could you even become so nazi ? 
  and to this i must add , that while peasants of south russia starved in collectivization , urban dwellers of intellectual professions were been torturing in prisons and executing directly , without any your `` deportation '' or `` enslavement '' . 
  somehow though nobody does call it genocide - probably , because while there are countries that equal `` repressed peasants '' and `` we '' - there is no country yet to equal `` we '' and `` repressed teachers '' . 
  baltics , you are very cultural people , i think it 's your turn to defend people who were destroyed and murdered only because they were as smart as estonians . 
  coffee is a noble democratic western drink , it 'll annihilate any cunning bizantine metal with the flaming sword of freedom . 
  but he drinks coffee . 
   but when chechens want independence thats a `` no no ! '', 
  it 's really not so much about chechens wanting independence , the problem is when chechens want independence , they usually try to solve this with murders , hostage takings , tortures and slavery . 
  well , then read the alphabet , please . 
  it is basic for all russian schools . 
  not some conspiracy . 
  i wonder , how it is even possible . 
  you read the books about roman history , you read th books about etymology of latin , you read the books about greece , and about persians , and about scythians , and about spartacus and damned etruscan , and gracchus , and nero , and early christianity , and ellinistic egypt , and so on , and so on . 
  then some guy comes . 
  he just recently opened the prophet for himself . 
  he read the book , he is exalted . 
  the worlds are opening before his eyes , the truth mercilessly invades his mind . 
  he says : `` read mommzen , you are so pathetic '' . 
  the wrong one is that who does n't understand history as any science does n't end on someone 's opinion , and there 's no the book with absolute truth about everything . 
  well , you are wrong on so many levels about jews and holocaust . 
  really need to read something like climov . 
  it is not true . 
  tatars origin form turkic tribes , not mongols . 
  they created islamic states and fought with russians long before the mongolian invasion . 
  and i always thought the spaniards are the most greedy people of europe , because one old wizard making gifts is not enough for them , they also need mage kings for this . 
  i must realize long ago , there was some mistake in conclusions . 
  it is stylistic , you can capitalize any words as long as they are important . 
  though ignoring commas in verbal adverb phrases demands someone 's blood , definitely . 
  it is the seccessionist movement in its development . 
  in catalonia , bretagne , bavaria and california after all it will be totally the same . 
   have completely supressed any secessionist movements ? 
  there is ukraine , there is mongolia . 
   what about the people of catalan origin in other parts of spain ? 
  they are traitors who betrayed perfectly greatest and greatly perfectest catalonia by collaborating with spanish occupants . 
  their vote does n't matter . 
  because life with phimosis is painful . 
  english . 
  one million words . 
  still not enough to evade words with 20 meanings . 
  well , i will give all my billions ( except one ) to anyone who will prove some billionaire is my father . 
  who are those barbarians with negative opinion about roma ? 
  crush them , kill them , turn them into slaves . 
  how it does not count ? 
  of course it counts , a lot !, 
  estonia , you are counted . 
  two things make me believe there was a plan and the world was created by a smart designer : how one liter of water weighs exactly one kg and how moldova 's economy fits exactly one moldova 's economy . 
  actually , violet is on the opposite side of the spectrum and purple is a mix of red and violet that lies out of the spectrum at all . 
  but english messes all the stuff , as usual . 
  stop this shit !, 
  why do we even need talk in a language of lazy bastards , who think there is no problem because everybody must learn their own language ? 
  let 's learn the language of cultural understanding people appreciating european cultures , let 's go dutch . 
  well , some of them are definitely anti-slovak , some have troubles with hygiene and there 's always a probablity some of them have been working as prostitutes before . 
  all is clear and understandable . 
  just another proof french origins from russian . 
  female prisons are n't such violent . 
  this - u - is just a british provincialism , pure american does n't have it . 
  imagine how great it would be if instead of states there were billions of microstates of one man . 
  old russian . 
  church slavonic language is ... well , it is church . 
  and origins from bulgarian , not russian . 
   if us will fall into two halfs , it 's the eastern part ( where the statehood core is ) that would become the successor of current us california is in the west . 
   blackmail is a crime so you could report it to the police before they dump something with your name on it . 
  though you still can spoil life to people you do n't like without warning them about it . 
  so , either you give me these pathetic $ 500 , or in a week your name will be found on some country road in a trash bag . 
   i 've surely miss something along the reasoning path , lol hitler was a pole . 
  and a jew . 
  if he has become a king now , then ... who was the king before ? 
  ... his father ? 
  but his father 's chosen people are jews .

  you 're either ` defensive ' or not . 
  there is no ` just a tip ' in this notion . 
  serbs posed no threat to a nato member but they were attacked by nato nonetheless . 
  end of story . 
  if nato wanted to keep their ` defensive ' status intact , they prolly should have made it in a different manner , not as an alliance . 
  are you really _ that _ mad at rufed taking note of its only ally in europe getting bombed by the existential enemy of its predecessor ? 
  except rogozin said it in ** 2009 ** then putin expressed his disappointment ( ? ), 
  that 's what i 'm pointing out in response to your ` antagonise nato out of the blue ' . 
   russia was even contending to join it , but they refused , and started to antagonize nato out of blue sky . 
  living in alternative realities must be fun  [ soviets tried to join nato in 1954 | the guardian ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/17/russia.iantraynor )  a year after stalin died in 1953 and a year before the warsaw pact was established in 1955 , the kremlin asked to join nato , according to a secret file which president vladimir putin unveiled last night , writes ian traynor . 
  < . .   a mischievous putin pointed out that he suggested russian membership of nato a year ago but was rebuffed by madeleine albright , then the us secretary of state . 
   and while it was stressed that russia and america could be ` allies ' , colin powell , albright 's successor , made clear that that was ` allies with a small `` a '' ' . 
  if your relatives have grown dumb , this is your job to educate them . 
  do n't leave it to tv . 
  duly noted though , i agree , tv can really be a destructive force . 
  time will tell though how really popular rt is , i think i read the other day that they 're exaggerating the number of viewers . 
  if two million euros ( correct me if i 'm wrong about the actual figures ) thrown into your political system could have inflicted such a massive damage , then there is something terribly wrong with the aforementioned system . 
  but that 's only two millions . 
  whereas it is thought that more [ than $ 100 billion have been spent on exporting fanatical wahhabism ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-yousaf-butt-/saudi-wahhabism-islam-terrorism_b_6501916.html ) to various much poorer muslim nations worldwide over the past three decades . 
  while we 're at it : this is news to me that le pen has any chances to become a president , seriously . 
  so far , her party has only got 2 ( or 3 ? ), 
  seats in the french parliament , iirc . 
  to be fair , the saudi-funded mosques and imams dotted all over europe pose a much bigger threat to european stability , at least , in the long term . 
  spreading of salafism may be detrimental to the pan-european security . 
  meanwhile , you can stop watching rt ( or any other news channel with agenda for that matter ) at any moment , and bam !, 
  you are no longer exposed to kremlin 's propaganda . 
  this is a matter of personal choice , after all . 
   president is responsible for everything going on in the country this is an extremely idealistic point of view . 
  from what i 've gathered from your words , you wanted a true hero from marvel comics on the throne of ukraine and now you 're getting disappointed . 
  which was bound to happen with that attitude . 
  there should be no tsar , no boyars , and no throne to begin with . 
  if you looked closely at western europe , you might find that for many high-ranked politics out there , their position is just a job , not some sacred mission in behalf of their countries . 
  that would be a good start , i mean , trying to change your own mindset and stop setting the high expectations . 
  ` euronews ' is still available for free throughout the territory of russia , just saying . 
  the military 's honour code , some people might take it too seriously . 
  a high ranked military officer blowing his brains out , be it out of a failure at work or any other good reason , is a normal occurrence in the former soviet states . 
  at very least , they are _ expected _ to do so in public 's eyes . 
  immigration might be the answer to that . 
  and 1.78 in 2015 . 
  it 's hard to say anything for certain . 
  the public opinion can be easily shaped to any desired result . 
   if stepanova or klishina win gold medals , wo n't they still be welcomed home as heroes ? 
  no , they wo n't . 
  if anything , klishina has already become a target of online harassment . 
  one politician even suggested that she should participate in the olympics as part of the team of ukraine , because she is a ` traitor to her country ' and all stuff like that . 
  this is one myth i 've yet to heard of to this day . 
  projecting much ? 
  he got to hold the sceptre and utterly failed . 
  that means he is a bad economist , no more , no less . 
  why on earth should i take his words at face value ? 
  ^ written by egor gaidar , a failed economist and one of the most hated politicians ever . 
  his views on the collapse of the ussr are well known . 
  honestly , i did n't even bother to read this crap . 
  you must 've missed the moment when about a half of a million of muscovites were protesting on ussr 's actions in the baltic . 
  we left because we wanted to , not the other way around . 
  that 's correct . 
  the reserve fund has kinda been a rainy day fund . 
  so , the rainy day has finally come and now they 're spending that money . 
  i do n't think you understand the meaning of the word ` opposition ' while making your categorical judgement . 
  no siree , there is an opposition in rufed , except said opposition , in comparison , leaves the dearest leader 's government somewhere in the liberal side of the political spectrum . 
  admitting this ` wrongdoing ' can and does land people in jail , so it 's kinda late for regrets and excuses at this point . 
  there are already a number of people who got jailed for hitting ` like ' on a wrong webpage . 
  way too many f-yous and f-offs . 
  could you please express your thoughts in a less aggressive manner ? 
  thank you . 
  as the old saying goes : ' a crow does n't pick out another crow 's eyes ' . 
  no spoilers , please . 
  or else !, 
  speaking of abusing the law : in order to fulfill the necessary requirements , russian isps and telecom companies will need to spend about 2/3 of the country 's gdp on building new data centers . 
  how do you think , is it possible to be done in the next 100 or so years ? 
  hence the fuss about the law that efficiently makes everyone guilty by default . 
  the era of cheap broadband internet has just come to an end in rufed . 
  so did the lion 's share of it industry . 
  i just ca n't wrap my head around this . 
  memes are n't _ that _ bad per se . 
  it 's just a thing that clogs up discussions . 
  hence the heavy-handed approach . 
   mr. obama embraced a disputed method for counting civilian casualties that did little to box him in . 
  it in effect counts all military-age males in a strike zone as combatants , according to several administration officials , unless there is explicit intelligence posthumously proving them innocent . 
  [ `` militants '' : media propaganda | to avoid counting civilian deaths , obama re-defined `` militant '' to mean `` all military-age males in a strike zone '' ] ( http://www.salon.com/2012/05/29/militants_media_propaganda/ ) i mean , no wonder their numbers are lower . 
  it depends on how you count them ` civilians ' . 
   likewise , the eu should devise ways to support civil society , students , researchers , and small - and medium-size enterprises in russia , as they struggle for freedom , democracy , and prosperity . 
  yeah , guy . 
  we 've been waiting for 25 years for you to start making steps in that direction . 
  i 'm fairly sure it wo n't take another 25 years until you finally begin to do it !, 
  oh , wait , it 's the eu we 're talking about . 
  not gon na happen in our lifetime then . 
  what is telling here is that soros is universally hated by both the european right wing and russian conservators . 
  his pro-democracy ngos has been somewhat active in rufed for the last two decades until they were deemed ` undesirable ' and eventually banned from the country . 
  neither do we . 
  i 'm not arguing that the law is not draconian and unjust . 
  it is . 
  i just hate that the gay card is being played by the west in its push to a regime change in rufed . 
  believe me , being a lgbt person here is difficult enough without all those western propogandeurs capitalizing on misery of the people they do n't give a damn about . 
  the blame should be put where it 's due . 
  ask yourself , how come that other people did manage to left flowers and notes at the us embassy building ? 
  by the way , aside from state sponsored rallies , i 've yet to witness many people condoning russia 's actions in ukraine . 
  i know , that must be a miracle of some sort , but i 've been at anti-war rallies here . 
  your attempts to belittle the russian opposition movement , doing this from a comfy chair , are just disgusting , to put it lightly . 
  well done , congrats .

  \u041e\u043e\u043e is that refreshing !, 
  join our discussions at / r/geopolitics , i believe it will pique your interest !, 
  commonwealth is n't puerto rico 's status-defining title , it 's a territory of the united states , much like all other pre-statehood lands west of the mississippi . 
  massachusetts and virginia are both commonwealths , but the title is a formality not a status title like statehood is, 
  * you 're welcome *, 
   not even the order of magnitude close to you , even in modern times ( example : chechnya ) . 
  this has anything to do with ukraine because ... ? 
  it was ukrainian artillery bombarding donetsk , and it was ukrainian citizens who suffered , or are they not your people as well ? 
    yet everytime russia makes a foreign policy decision  what foreign policy decision are talking about ? 
  being shot down by turkey ? 
  did you decide that ? 
  more like everytime russia meets western europe on syria , smugness is n't your strong suit, 
   well , good luck transporting electricity by the sea . 
  that 's not being blockaded , that was just vandalized  could n't give two fucks about russian decisions , unless they involve taking our land or killing our people . 
  you guys did a great job of killing your people on your own  that is exactly right . 
  get off our territory and stop trying to influence our politics . 
  then do whatever you want - we do n't care . 
  yet everytime russia makes a foreign policy decision , ukrainian media somehow tries to tie it to ukraine . 
  the fact that / r/ukrainianconflict has posts on syria only proves it . 
  the court pays , not russia, 
  you actually believe that blockade matters ? 
  ships are a thing , all it did was partially block a market for ukrainian businesses and show that that nationalists do n't really want crimea back . 
  it 's the equivalent of shooting yourself in the foot screaming ` take that ! ', 
  what is it with ukraine that it wants to have to do with every decision russia makes ? 
  i thought you patriots want ` independence from moskali ', 
  was pretty real in crimea , and it 's backed by polling by gallup . 
  just sounds like denial, 
  says the guy who unironically posts paul gregory opinion pieces, 
  boy are you in the wrong place for that ... 
  i want to know what pipeline is going to deliver all of that oil from the western hemisphere to you edit : although apparently shipping is n't as big of an issue anymore for crude, 
   syrian rebels have amassed multiple manpad models since 2012 , and the islamic state has generally had little trouble acquiring any weapon used by syrian rebels either through purchase or capture , military analysts say . 
  though the pentagon 's central command acknowledges this concern , it said it had no conclusive evidence yet that the islamic state had such weapons . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/world/middleeast/missiles-of-isis-may-pose-peril-for-aircrews.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=homepage&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;wt.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0 the pentagon acknowledges the issue but wo n't actually confirm it to be true since they are also helping to supply the rebels, 
  we have 1 recently refitted aircraft currently in the barents sea area : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_aircraft_carrier_admiral_kuznetsov of course , that obviously is not enough, 
  the uk has nuclear weapons , no one would attack them anyway . 
  countries with significant defense industries and nuclear weapons to use are a big nuisance for any attacker , it would have to be some serious shit going down that is worth taking a nuke to a major city . 
  nobody is like that right now, 
  they in fact are not even fighting the mispelled group , turkey has decent relations with iraqi kurdistan, 
  government is actually taking seriously in public , putin condemning the dopers , ria novosti talking about it , etc it 's definitely something the gov wants to fight, 
  ah yes , our dear friend yuschenko , rehabilitator of upa and bandera , herald of nato , russia 's bestest friend . 
  even under yanukovich anti-russian hysterics managed to annoy the shit out of many people east of the dnieper , and act as a great scapegoat against problems in the country . 
  how did alarm bells not start ringing when you were all voting him in ? 
  he is an oligarch , and the only response i could get was `` we have to give him a chance '' , which is absolutely ludicrous !, 
   maybe if after some more years ukraine does n't have any jurisdiction in donetsk than we can consider crimea as an independent entity . 
  it 's hk now apparently, 
  i thought you meant wwii , although major moves into america usually had to do with the stability , especially now . 
  the myth of the `` american dream '' is definitely not as strong as it was before, 
  inb4 the russians did it, 
   cant find your car keys ? 
  yeah , fucking russia took them dead, 
  it 's there for the same reason lapti are : souvenirs of russia as a state/souvenirs integrated from other groups into russian culture . 
  not exactly surprising, 
  it 's cheating to bring it up in this case , because the us was extremely isolated away from the events in europe at the time . 
  no shit everyone would try to move to america , nazis could n't swim that far in large numbers, 
  lol sure, 
  how about instead of choosing to be an ignorant fuck you actually read about the bloody war ? 
  you 'd think simon would at least provide context for how south ossetia and abkhazia gained their de-facto independence ( hinthint : georgian civil war ) , but no , russia is evil and south ossetians and abkhazians do n't real . 
  ostrovsky 's reports have went down in quality so much from the ukrainian episodes, 
  more like they stood back because saakashvili was imagining support he never had . 
  simply sucking up to the us is n't going to make them help , especially in a direct war with russian troops, 
  that 's such an obvious provocation that it 's not even funny . 
  transdniester and gaugazia already exist, 
  they really do n't , due to the length of time they have spent living with a more prevalent russian culture , with the same religion only encouraging it , most finno-ugric people have gone through varying stages of assimilation , especially since the physical differences are n't that big, 
  actually mari people have started to develop a new form of nationalism that focuses on unity with russian culture . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cooelkabxwa ) . 
  wikipedia does not provide the necessary nuances that define the relations between finno-ugric peoples and russians , it is unfair to call it forced russification when it is much more along the lines of integration of a smaller ethnic group into a more prevalent culture , examples can be also found in the far east where a smaller indigenous siberian group will merge into a larger one . 
  and it is n't like these ethncities are marginalized from society , the mayor of moscow is of mansi descent for instance . 
  that 's because their pride and identity is for themselves and the federation , not for rfe/rl . 
  buryats , tatars , bashkirs , etc are all rossiyani,

  that 's exactly what 's happening with the third ring and the existing line expansions , the system will still be under a lot of pressure considering everyone tends to go towards the center, 
  that 's because you portray yourselves as the purveyor of democracy or some shit, 
  black sun empire and noisia man, 
  he is an oligarch, 
  khodorkovsky is a fucking oligarch , he put on such an innocent look when in fact he most certainly belonged in jail . 
  he 's a berezovsky that got away with acting innocent, 
  the problem here is 1 ) his arrests did not involve exile to siberia as you claimed and 2 ) navalny is not an example of a viable alternative , considering his ties with ethnic nationalists , shady power plays within the opposition , and his appeal to populism within opposition circles . 
  navalny is absolutely one of the worst choices for president , let alone mayor of moscow as he tried before . 
  if navalny is what you consider a serious candidate , then the ` serious ' part of ` serious opposition ' is pretty skewed, 
  give me one example of a politician literally sent to siberia , i 'll wait, 
  it 's not like he eats them or anything , they just do a good job on their own being fuckbois . 
  it 's not news either , any actual serious research on russian opposition points to how out of touch they are with the rest of the country, 
  hence bubble, 
  probably , just do n't base these things off of reddit . 
  people here sometimes do n't understand why online polls could be innaccurate, 
  exactly , it 's not like anyone else in the region is fighting because ` terrorism ' , everyone is funding their own proxies in this war in order to gain influence in a pretty strategically located state . 
  turkey and the gulf states each fund their respective non-isil militant group , iran and russia fund and arm assad . 
  meanwhile the syrian kurds are looking for anyone to help them out with dealing with turkey in the north and is in the south , and they have expressed interested working with assad , seeing as they have a working relationship of sort with the government . 
  i think the kurds will continue to fight for their own behalf until the point where they can proclaim autonomy in whatever government will be in control in the future , which is a smart play given their limited resources, 
  it 's funny hearing anything about brainwashing from someone who manages to devote his time solely to articles trying discredit a country . 
  people tend to have interests in many fields , the only time you go to a sub outside worldnews or europe is to post something attacking russia that is somewhat related to the sub in question . 
  all you do is spam and shitpost , i really do n't care for what you have to say . 
  i have better things to do than read shitposts all day , the novelty wears off quickly, 
   well then i hope i can change what a typical poster is . 
  i 'll be frequenting these threads as russia is one of our bordering nations and i 'll do what i can to bring levelheadedness to the discussion . 
  thank you , that 's quite nice to hear on a sub like this  so , what do you envision putins russia looks like ? 
  i imagine russia will push on in the north trying to lay the path for future endeavors ( like the test of the artic nations ) . 
  with global warming , russia will definitely secure the new sea lanes that will appear in its waters for shipping .

   the us navy 's most technologically advanced warship broke down while transiting through the panama canal , the second setback for the $ 4 billion ship in the last two months .

  lithuania does n't . 
  why should russia interfere in the internal matters of chechnya ? 
  this is a homogenous , mono-ethnic republic ; they have had their own police , courts and clergy for more than a decade now . 
  from a practical ( and cynical ) standpoint , i consider the chechens to have won both wars , b/c now they 're enjoying both self-rule ( and practical impunity for chechen nationals ) _ and _ the inflow of russian money . 
  they should be left to their own devices .

  ** macron marches into the breach of eu overhaul ** * arguably his boldest idea would establish a eurozone budget overseen by a eurozone finance minister * ^ by ^ simon ^ nixon ^ updated ^ may ^ 14 , ^ 2017 ^ 3:42 ^ p.m. 
  ^ et the symbolism could hardly be clearer : emmanuel macron will spend his first full day as president of france in berlin visiting german chancellor angela merkel . 
  the man who campaigned as an ardent pro-european , who greeted the crowds at his victory rally to the strains of the european union anthem , and who pledged at his inauguration on sunday to `` reform and relaunch the eu '' is signaling that this work starts immediately . 
  yet mr. macron may find the challenge of overhauling the eu even more daunting than reforming france . 
  his ambitions for the eu extend from defense to border control , to climate change to tackling so-called social dumping -- the attempt to gain a competitive advantage through looser fiscal , environmental and labor-market policies . 
  but the most eye-catching aspect of his european agenda is his proposal to create a eurozone budget overseen by a eurozone finance minister . 
  in seeking to deepen eurozone fiscal integration , mr. macron is n't short of support . 
  there is a broad agreement across the eurozone that something must be done to restore public confidence in the single currency following a series of shocks that have left much of the continent suffering from high unemployment and stagnating living standards . 
  berlin and brussels also recognize that mr. macron 's election has created a political imperative to show a willingness to engage with the new president 's agenda . 
  but it wo n't be easy . 
  the european commission was tasked by eu leaders two years ago to come up with proposals for deepening economic and monetary union , and the commission is due to publish its proposals at the end of this month . 
  yet these proposals have become the subject of wrangling between national governments with no certainty as to what will emerge , brussels officials with knowledge of the process said . 
  two major ideas are under discussion , both broadly in line with ideas floated by mr. macron and his allies . 
  the first is to use the eurozone 's bailout fund -- the european stability mechanism -- to create so-called european safe bonds , securitized bonds that would be issued by the esm and backed by a pool of eurozone government bonds . 
  initially , governments would remain responsible for their own liabilities , but ultimately esb 's could be guaranteed by the esm -- and therefore jointly guaranteed by eurozone governments -- transforming them into genuine eurobonds . 
  the second proposal is to create a common european-wide unemployment insurance fund , which would allow countries hit by an economic shock to reclaim part of the cost of higher unemployment benefits . 
  both ideas are problematic . 
  it is n't clear there will be any market for european safe bonds without an esm guarantee , which governments are in any case unwilling to allow . 
  and with or without an esm guarantee , there are growing concerns that the creation of a large pool of esbs could trigger a collapse in demand for the nonpooled bonds of the eurozone 's weaker credits , leaving those countries facing higher rather than lower funding costs . 
  the problem with the unemployment-insurance idea is it would require the politically challenging harmonization of the eurozone 's highly divergent labor-market rules and welfare systems . 
  what both proposals show is that it is very hard to find a halfway house between the current eurozone setup , in which there is limited risk-sharing , and a full political union that would allow brussels far greater oversight of national budgets and labor-market and welfare policies . 
  this task is made harder by the need to avoid changes to the eu treaties , which might trigger referendums in many countries , where public appetite is limited for the transfers of sovereignty needed to underpin deeper fiscal integration , let alone any willingness in germany and other northern european countries to pool debts . 
  that could limit the overhauls to little more than german finance minister wolfgang sch\u00e4uble 's current proposal to turn the esm into a european monetary fund with increased powers to enforce the eurozone 's existing rules . 
  would this be so bad ? 
  in economic terms , perhaps not . 
  the contrasting fortunes of postcrisis spain and ireland with the sluggish recoveries of italy and portugal should caution against blaming the eurozone 's problems on a lack of fiscal transfers -- as opposed to weak domestic policies . 
  evidence from the u.s. suggests the importance of fiscal transfers in stabilizing a currency union can be overstated : private capital flows help smooth around two-thirds of shocks to regional output , compared with 13 % by fiscal transfers , according to the european central bank . 
  that suggests the eurozone 's priority should be strengthening its banking systems and delivering overhauls that would improve cross-border investment flows . 
  nonetheless , mr. macron 's political imperative remains , and the fate of the eurozone may now hinge on his success . 
  no wonder he is beating a path to berlin . 
  just in case : ----- ** defiant orban encourages hungarians to say no to brussels ** * prime minister hardens anti-eu stance despite country 's reliance on bloc 's funding * lajos nanassy is sick and tired of what he sees as western european hypocrisy . 
  the 77-year-old hungarian folk singer , who sports a thick moustache , says the eu is soft on refugees , holds too much power and should stop pushing hungary around . 
  `` germans , belgians and french ; they all accuse hungarians of racism and yet they have the most notorious records in history , '' he declares . 
  mr nanassy was attending a crowded public meeting in support of the multibillion forint `` stop brussels ! '' campaign launched by hungarian prime minister viktor orban . 
  a publicly funded billboard advertising blitz and questionnaire sent to more than 8m hungarians has warned them of an `` unholy alliance '' of eu bureaucrats , human rights groups and the billionaire investor george soros , all intent on killing jobs , raising taxes and flooding hungary with migrants . 
  `` they dream of a world without borders , '' szilard nemeth , a senior government mp told the audience at csepel island -- a post-industrial budapest suburb , dotted with abandoned communist-era factories and apartment blocks ringed by overgrown fields . 
  mr orban late last month promised his centre-right political allies in brussels that he would end the `` constant attacks on brussels '' -- and a crackdown on foreign universities that has sparked an eu lawsuit . 
  but the increasingly populist prime minister , who has sparked controversy with his illiberal reforms , has shown little sign of reversing course . 
  this month , he has instead intensified his anti-eu campaign , but rather than leaving the eu -- an idea most hungarians oppose -- mr orban insists he wants to recast the bloc in a more conservative form . 
  analysts say he hopes to halt a slide in approval ratings by mobilising his core voters against meddlesome brussels elites . 
  ahead of parliamentary elections due by next april , he hopes this rhetoric will help his fidesz party see off a threat from nationalist rivals such as the far-right jobbik party . 
  in this environment , politicians in brussels who criticise mr orban directly run the risk of playing into his hands -- by increasing his appeal to nationalist voters . 
  last week , frans timmermans , european commission vice-president , in an interview with die zeit accused mr orban of using anti-semitic tones in comments about mr soros at the european parliament . 
  hungary 's foreign minister in return called on him to resign . 
  `` george soros is a speculator and it 's not anti-semitic to say that -- it 's the truth , '' mr nemeth told his grey-haired audience , which spilled out the back of the csepel community hall and into a car park . 
  he pressed a button and up flashed a picture of european commission president jean-claude juncker embracing mr soros with a kiss on the cheek , prompting a chorus of boos and groans from the audience . 
  at first glance , csepel appears to be an unlikely hotbed of eurosceptism ; what little new development has come courtesy of brussels . 
  a new harbour , roads and a municipal water treatment plant were built with hundreds of millions of euros in eu grants and loans . 
  but attitudes have shifted dramatically since 2003 , when 83.8 per cent of voters supported hungary 's entry into the european union . 
  although hungary has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of eu funds , incomes have failed to converge with western standards . 
  mr orban rejects the idea that lucrative eu funds -- worth $ 5.6 bn or more than 5 per cent of output in 2015 -- mean he should support eu decisions he disagrees with . 
  [ infographics ] ( https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3a%2f%2fcom.ft.imagepublish.prod.s3.amazonaws.com%2f996e76d2-3653-11e7-99bd-13beb0903fa3?source=next&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;width=601 ) for his critics , hungary 's reliance on eu financial support makes his attacks on the bloc , and his illiberal reforms , all the more galling . 
  `` we ran out of patience some time ago , '' says frank engel , a luxembourgish mep and orban critic . 
  he says members of the european parliament will this week invoke an `` article 7.1 resolution '' -- a procedure designed to halt a breach of the eu 's founding democratic values , one that could ultimately lead to the suspension of hungary 's voting rights . 
  the procedure is an unprecedented step , and would almost certainly be vetoed by poland , which is the subject of a separate `` rule of law dialogue '' with the commission . 
  mr timmermans has cautioned against invoking the procedure prematurely . 
  he wants the eu to find new ways to harness relative high public support in its eastern members and has released a four-page rebuttal of the hungarian government 's claims , available on the commission 's website . 
  istvan hegedus , president of the hungarian europe society , wants the commission to go further and launch its own advertising campaign to rebut mr orban 's claims . 
  but eu officials shy away from such a public confrontation with a member state , meaning few hungarians hear the brussels perspective . 
  among fidesz ' core supporters , like those at csepel , eu criticism of mr orban only makes them more committed . 
  `` we should n't care what the west says about us anyway -- soon it will be a crime to say we are even hungarian , '' said one woman in her sixties . 
  mr nemeth urged the attendees to channel their energy into filling out some of the eight million surveys that have been sent to households asking them how to respond to `` attacks '' from brussels . 
  `` vikor orban defended hungary in brussels , '' he told them . 
  `` now he needs you to strengthen his hand . '', 
  public housing but individual apartments are either privately owned or owned by the municipality of moscow ( i.e. 
  social housing ) . 
  it depends . 
  a lot of first gen 5 storeys ( the ones that were built of concrete plates ) are in terrible conditions . 
  on top of that , really , really bad design . 
  stalin 's era brick buildings , on the other hand , are way better and , imo , simply should be fixed / renovated . 
  that 's the funniest part . 
  they ( as in the gov ` t ) do n't go into details . 
  seems like that as of now it remains a purely political decision . 
  short answer : nobody knows it yet . 
  hence the fuss . 
  edit : a bit longer answer : the renovation program is nothing new , actually . 
  old concrete 5-storeys ( `` kruschevkas '' ) in moscow have been demolished non-stop for more than 30 years now . 
  from time to time it becomes a problem . 
  for instance , most people do n't want to be relocated to more distant districts ( because of the property prices that may significantly vary from district to district ) . 
  the government has laid out a massive renovation plan that potentially may affect up to 20 % of moscow households . 
  many people are not happy with that , b/c they expect abuses of all kinds and rightly so . 
  i could n't care less about whoever said it , it is simply not true .

  ------ exxon mobil corp. . xom 1.06 % is suffering from sanctions on russia .

   free trade is harmful and not wanted in russia ? 
  it is . 
  just like north stream 2 is considered harmful and not wanted in eu . 
   why western products are really popular in russia i do n't see them anymore in the supermarkets that i use to visit . 
  i just realized that 90 % of the food i use to buy is russian and 10 % - are fruits from china , east and asia . 
   products that despite being banned are still being smuggled in and bought please check the facts . 
  a year ago they started just destroy forbidden food by handreds of tons . 
  no one in their right mind would continue to lose their money . 
  western food was successfully replaced , mostly by russian . 
  and i can tell you i like russian food even more . 
  edit : you probably mean that westerns ** cheat ** trying to avoid ban ? 
  just have read they started to * modify * their `` perfect quality '' products . 
  yet another reason for me to stay away from those if i ever find them . 
  i heard your country netherlands may exit eu to lift anti-russian sanctions ? 
  you can tell them do not bother . 
  it really seems like russia does n't need you anymore . 
  have a good day . 
  not sure what they 're expecting now . 
  if i had a pork business in russia , i would n't mess with putin anyway . 
   the fact that you actually argue about it , like , `` i do n't understand anything about this i actually work as an engineer in power production industry and do everything : hardware , software - both low and high level . 
   analog switch , is a switch . 
  it 's either on , or off i see . 
  it 's actually called `` diskrete '' . 
   but that 's exactly your goal as a consumer i 'm a human in first place . 
   putin 's sanctions on all the normal russians i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  stores are full of goods from the countries that do n't support usa & co. 
   as opposed to going through lines of text on a monitor there are visial presentations on monitors these days . 
  you ( not you exactly but some engineer ) can draw a picture just like operator wants . 
  google for wincc pictures . 
  let alone descriptions . 
  but i never worked on nuclear power stations , maybe they have good reasond for the different design , i just do n't see why . 
  i did , i only buy necessary stuff now produced by russia and countries that do not support sanctions . 
  ahh right . 
  totally forgot . 
  they sanctioned our industry , military , banking etc and expected us to buy their goods . 
  thats why . 
  there are russian food , clothes , furniture , houses , consumer electronics etc. 
  but hard to fix or upgrade anything . 
  personally i have no idea on why such a design . 
  it 'd be a pain in the ass to work with something like that either for operator or engineers . 
  well there is a network , but it 's a solely technology network not connected to even office network of the power station . 
  i mean , on some random power plant . 
  comprehensive test means : under full load . 
  source : i work in power plant industry . 
  have you even tried to read that ? 
  it is russian ** responce ** to the foreign sanctions . 
  ( just in case ) foreign sanctions were first . 
  i used to buy foreign hi-end consumer electronics stuff and wanted to build a 3rd computer for home . 
  now those are 1,5-2 more at price , i stiil can buy them , but why would i do that ? 
  it 's time to hold on and think - do those toys make me happy ? 
  can consumption make me happy at all ? 
  long story short : i shifted the focus of my life to really important things like personal relations , health , traveling , education and communications with people . 
  i still have a lot of spare money and i invest them in building industry . 
  lol , putin is not that stupid . 
  west is . 
  they are those who are suffering the most . 
  usa does n't care , russia only benefits . 
  it 's really simple . 
  russians were tired of reforms and putin had to feed them first . 
  and the simpliest way to achieve that was oil and gas selling . 
  now oil price has dropped , but we can benefit even from that and i explained how . 
  and the most interesting part is that price drop ( and national currency drop ) in people minds was developed by usa . 
   then 99 % of population would have to starve to death we definitely do n't want that . 
  and here industrialisation comes to rescue . 
  but industrialisation is just a tool and production + consumption should never be our goal . 
  `` they '' - those who sanctioned you . 
  personally i do n't care about your money . 
  feel free to kiss their asses as much as you want . 
   who made the device you wrote this on ? 
  what about the operating system , web browser ? 
  geez . . who told you human race needs those to evolute at first place ? 
  you really need * that much * of industrialisation to make a family , raise kids and be happy ? 
  i can tell you that i 'm smoking . 
  should i be grateful for that too or i am a victim ? 
   calling for an end to sanctions sanctions is a godsend . 
  russian industry started to raise without competitors and wo n't be happy to meet those foreign hungry sharks at the moment . 
  bacause they made it pointless to spend much money on their useless foreign goods ? 
  recently i was in europe and barely spent 1/3 of my cache money . 
  expensive foreign goods got 1,5-2 pricey ? 
  keep them , i better spend my money on something russian now . 
  well , original poster recently got good portion of criticism in / r/russia and now i see why . 
  thanks , but the role of gazprom foreign partners in all of this stll is n't clear for me . 
   the overall numbers of troops in germany has dropped i see . 
  and that obviously had nothing to do with your chances to get german gold back . 
  usa just stepped back like they were told with no question . 
   it is pure idiocy to believe that usa would ever attack russia ... i mean what kind of stupid person regarding your last words - ever heard of proxy wars ? 
   we got rid of the american military that proves nothing . 
  perhaps americans did n't need that base or more likely some kind of trade happend as it use to be . 
   why ca n't gazprom understand oh , so now gazprom is on their own and all their european partners including germany just disappeared ? 
  i see . 
  goog luck with getting german gold back from the usa . 
  i would n't hold my breath though . 
  i do n't . 
  even more : i said sanctions and oil price drop is godsend for the russian economy . 
  but still those considered . 
  not to menton thousands of deaths . 
  is that true ? 
  the coup in ukraine , sanctions , oil price drop , nato expansion to the russian borders , that whining from poland and baltic states , russian athletes ban etc. 
  and no , i 'm not going to prove you anything . 
  apparently , obama would be happy to provide any information about anything , but i 'm just too lazy to ask him , sorry .

  yeah , it must be the reason hundreds of thousands of non-chechens flew from there before/during the first chechen war . 
  chechens were more or less problematic during the last two centuries at least , the only thing their society understands is overwhelming force . 
  ( * individual * chechens can be very nice people , and i know several myself . 
  but their society is pretty much stuck up in medieval times . ), 
   i do know the details . 
  unless you were there , no , you do n't . 
  i 'm not trying to white-wash russian media or black smear the western , no . 
  both are lying and ca n't be trusted . 
  but there is just not enough publicly available information to cross-reference the event and to figure out what exactly did happened there by comparing the info from different sources and figuring out the lies . 
   there is a long pattern of russia breaking up countries by arming separatists on their border . 
  there is a long patter of countries bordering russia to fail to solve their ethnic problems . 
  abkhazia , south ossetia ? 
  it was started by georgians who seceded from ussr but somehow ` disliked ' ( with army , heavy weapons and all shit ) when their minorities tried to secede from georgia in turn . 
  look up the history of those conflicts , there were no russians at their ignition . 
   meanwhile they literally obliterate parts of their own country when they want to leave you 're obviously talking about chechnya . 
  you should educate yourself about caucasus caliphate that chechen extremists tried to install there . 
  basically , they were doing just the same isis doing now in iraq/syria . 
  beheadings included , if you 're really lucky to go this easy . 
  ( this is the reason russian army was heavily criticized , our soldiers were not used to those new levels of brutality and often retaliated disproportionally . ), 
   but you are concerned with `` hypocrisy '' ? 
  yes , i am concerned with hypocrisy about the international law . 
  it obviously is being applied ( and even mentioned ) very selectively . 
   what next , you are n't aware of russia abducting people from neighboring countries in the baltics either ? 
  do you know any details of that event besides what media fed you ? 
  i do n't , so i restrain from judging it , and so should you . 
   soviet just meant russian . 
  no , it does not . 
  srsly , it 's just absurd . 
  you know nothing about actual ussr history and its inter-ethnic mechanics , go educate yourself . 
   russia flat out tried to erase other ethnic groups . 
  if you 're speaking about crimean tatars , most of them died in uzbekistan . 
  why not accuse them of poor management ? 
  ( well , * i * do know why it would be incorrect . 
  do you ? ), 
   i can easily point to quotes from russians on this website that prove my point . 
  and i can easily point to quotes from eu citizens who state that russia must be dismembered , destroyed or incinerated in the nuclear fires of hell . 
  so what ? 
  i 'm very concerned with the hypocrisy of the west . 
  i can accept the law , the international law , if it works all the time , like any law should do . 
  but apparently it works only when it 's convenient . 
  let 's take the strongest kamaz truck - [ kamaz-65225-22 ] ( http://www.kamaz.ru/ru/vehicle/cars/primemover/6522522/ ) . 
  according to specs , it can carry the load of 22 tons . 
  buckweat has the bulk density of about 660 kg/m ^ 3 . 
  hence , 22 tons of buckweat will take about 33 m ^ 3 of volume . 
  i must remind you that this is absolute maximum of what this particular truck can carry . 
  i do n't know exact size of trailers they 've used in this convoy , but [ this ] ( http://www.toptruck.ru/trailers/134869/ ) looks pretty similar in size , give or take , and according to specs it has the volume of 60m ^ 3 . 
  so , the buckweat will take only about half volume of this trailer while taking maximum possible weight . 
  add to this that only complete retard will load trucks to their max capacity if it is known that the road is quite tricky ( potholes from the shelling and the shelling itself ) , and you 'll get trucks loaded by may be 1/3 of their volume . 
  and do n't compare apples with oranges . 
  tractors are not build for 80 + km/h travel . 
  please show photo of one voting post in crimea where were ` russian military ' with guns . 
  if anything , russian military were holding guns to ukraine 's head , figuratively speaking , because somehow the west did n't cared when ukraine back then in nineties scrapped the autonomy of crimea , ignored crimean referendums ( the referendum of 2014 was * third * , ffs ) and annexed sevastopol which never belonged to ukraine . 
   source ? 
  only sources are in russian . 
  osce only says that trucks had arrived with ` rear cargo tailgates open ' , strangely not reporting what did they saw through those tailgates . 
  considering that there was only one case of baseless accusation from some ukrainian official without any attempt to push further , i think the accusation was indeed baseless . 
   they werent checked before entering and the one showed to the press were strangely half empty . 
  they were checked before entering by red cross and border service ( although border service did their best to make it last as long as possible ) . 
  the press not only fail at physics ( kamaz truck fully loaded by weight with grain or other food will be less than half loaded by volume ) , but they were also biased as hell ( there are videos that document red cross guys checking trucks , on those videos trucks are quite filled ; but most media showed two or three ` convenient ' photos ) . 
   repeating what the first `` aid '' convoy did . 
  speaking out of your ass much ? 
  first aid convoy was checked by ukrainian border service on their way back to russia . 
  trucks were empty . 
   your leadership and far-right nationalists like you worship ussr whenever given the chance . 
  you mean , like when putin said ` whoever wants ussr back , has no brain ' ? 
  also , why the fuck i 'm suddenly a far-right nationalist ? 
   and you are claiming to know ussr history ? 
  the irony . 
  i do n't see any irony here . 
   no sane person in the world would want to learn anything from russian textbooks . 
  well , if you say so ... oh wait , you 're some nobody on teh internetz with nil scientific weight . 
   so russia was n't what ussr was based around ? 
  russification was n't a thing ? 
  russian culture and language was used by communists as a glue of sorts in an attempt at creating a super-ethnic state . 
  ussr was about being soviet , not being russian . 
  actually , russians were the most oppressed ethnicity in ussr , both absolutely and relatively . 
   putin is n't currently abusing interpol to make lives hell for people in the baltics for refusing to join russians in killing people in the baltics no , he is n't . 
  i did n't heard anything about interpol , for starters , and we do n't know any details because , well , they were n't reported . 
  another attempt to say that you do n't know jack shit about the history of ussr and how it functioned . 
  communist party run ussr , not russia . 
   why would tatars want to return to a country that did ethnic cleansing of crimea in the first place ? 
  the country that did forced deportation ( and not ethnic cleansing ) was ussr . 
  both ukraine and russia were parts of ussr , and leader that ordered it to be done was not russian nor ukrainian but georgian . 
  article basically states that the name ` novorossia ' was n't used before putin ( except for centuries-old historical events ) , that putin somehow ` invented ' it , gave that name to that region . 
  simple google search proves this statement completely wrong , that the name ` novorossia ' was used before putin quite recently , it was used in modern ukraine to name certain region . 
  what 's hard to understand about it ? 
  borders of novorossia ( it is actually incorrect to translate it as ` new russia ' since geographical names are not translated ) shifted over time . 
  `` take novorossiya [ ... ] the term is plucked from tsarist history , when it represented a different geographical space . '' different geographical space ? 
  i 'm sorry , what ? 
  `` nobody who lives in that part of the world today ever thought of themselves as living in novorossiya '' thanks to google , such cringeworthy attempts at propaganda can be easily debunked . 
  just search for '' \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f '' from 01.01.2001 to 31.12.2012 , it was frequently used .

   russian government has pissed off russia 's biggest business partners . 
  russian government has pissed off western governments .

  i mean , i do n't know much about how people feel there . 
  i know the difference between french and non-french flanders though , maurice druon 's novels were hugely popular in russia , they 're one of my favs :d for instance , i was born in soviet ukraine to parents who were both born in soviet moldova , but i consider myself russian as i speak russian and identify with russian culture and nation . 
   words like genocide or totalitarism are politically misused and it only create problems like guys calling the katy\u0144 massacre a genocide . 
  so if you argued with technical arguments that the holodomor was n't a genocide and get crucified , that is only pure circlejerking . 
  for two months i argued about stalin 's legacy on this sub and gotten over 500 net downvotes , no kidding . 
  i wrote essay-long posts but ultimately got downvoted because while i called stalin a horrible murderer , i argued that ussr did not engage in genocide vs poles , even though we killed at least 100,000 of them . 
  i never argued that holodomor was n't a genocide though . 
  i just do n't like it when people equate holodomor to the holocaust and say hitler = stalin . 
  i do n't have anything against calling holodomor a genocide . 
  even if i am willing to call both genocides , implying there was equivalency in hitler 's and stalin 's plans in incredibly disingenuous . 
  i was just using it as a hypothetical in this thread . 
   i am not stating that the congolese murders were not an horrible crime and i am not whitewashing it at all . 
  i am just saying , the numbers do not make a genocide . 
  but see , if i say the same thing about holodomor , this sub will crucify me . 
  do you see what i mean ? 
  it 's somehow ok for westerners to say this , but not for a russian . 
  i mean , you 're not technically wrong in the sense that congo did not appear to be a concerted effort to eradicate an ethnicity . 
  the issue is , these days were are calling a lot of mass killings as ` genocides ' . 
  words are what the make of them . 
  however , i can guarantee you , nothing looks worse than someone of the aggressor nation trying to white-wash a historical crime . 
  it just looks bad . 
  if i try to white-wash stalin 's crimes , it will look really bad too if i say that holodomor was n't a genocide . 
  either way i call it , a lot of ukrainians were murdered . 
  so if they want to call it a genocide , i think the victims deserve some recognition , even if it 's not a technically correct terminology . 
  holodomor needs more recognition , russians need to face their historical crimes more , it will help us mature as a nation . 
  they were semi-deliberate . 
  they made the situation worse but the excuse was that the famine started itself . 
  same story in holodomor . 
  started with a typhoid epidemic at least where my grandparents lived . 
  then bad harvest two years in a row , epidemic kept raging , then it went into holodomor . 
  they remember eating tree bark ground up to make flour with grass ` salad ' . 
  terrible times . 
  in both the indian and the ukrainian case , the authorities made the situation much worse by diverting food supplies . 
  for that matter , yes , the irish famine was also like that , there is a chilling similarity in the irish and ukrainian famines -- the uk/ussr both kept vigorously exporting food from both countries to make even more money , all the whilst people were falling left and right . 
  if one is genocide , then all three are genocides . 
  or conversely , if one denies one of these being genocides , then none of them were genocides . 
  irish one had the least fatalities , as emigration was a possibility for many . 
  a little known fact , early 19th century ireland had twice the population of modern ireland . 
  insane fact considering how massively the world population across the globe exploded in the mid to late 19th century and especially in the 20th century . 
  ukrainian one had many more fatalities , but the indian famines were beyond compare , they were stretched over a period of * three terrible centuries * of the british deliberately starving indians . 
  just in the late 18th century famines , estimated 10mil died as the british kept diverting foodstuffs . 
  the last one happened during wwii . 
  all three cases are equally reprehensible . 
  however , for political reasons , only holodomor is mentioned . 
  so holodomor was n't a genocide either ? 
  how about the congolese genocide ? 
  estimated 5-10mil dead . 
  apparently in the past thread where i had the discussion , many euros do n't consider that one . 
  or the genocidal policies of the british in india , specifically the bengal area ( tens of millions dead , even churchill was in it , he famously declared that the indians ` will breed like rabbits anyway ' and asked ` if gandhi was dead yet ' . 
  now , you can argue that neither one wanted to fully exterminate the local people . 
  i guess that means holodomor is n't a genocide either then , because stalin certainly did n't wish to kill all of ukraine , just kill enough to pacify them . 
  so which one is it then ? 
  will european nations own up to their genocides , or will they simply point fingers at russia whilst keeping their own stuff quiet ? 
  it 's all or nothing . 
  either admit to those being genocides , or stop pointing fingers at others if you can not come to terms with your own history . 
  can confirm , i shot 3 ukrops this morning !, 
  then the soviet actions in poland and ukraine were n't genocide by that logic , except the majoriry of euros in / r/europe are big , rotten hypocrites who whitewash their history and then self-righteously rail at russia . 
  if i said holodomor was n't genocide i would be crucified on a cross of downvotes, 
  wow , let me take that argument and teach / r/europe why holodomor was n't a genocide !, 
  i bet you guys would totally upvote and agree with me !!!, 
  let me just edit a wiki article , because we know that a wiki article is the final arbiter in any argument  btw , just so we are clear , the nazi mods are on wikipedia . 
  read about it , it 's a big issue . 
  i mean nazi in the figurative , not literal far-right sense . 
  although some are far-right too . 
  the point is that wikipedia is curated by mod who all have their pet issues . 
  so when 100,000 poles are killed by ussr , it 's a genocide . 
  but when millions of congolese are killed , it 's not . 
  some estimates of dead congolese reach over 5-10mil even . 
  **** edit : i love the bias of that allegation btw . 
  the guy you quoted has a ba in history . 
  fun fact : so do i !, 
  we seem to have equal credentials . 
  neither of us have submitted our statements to a peer-reviewed journal either . 
  funny how the bullshit machine works ? 
  you know how many people have a ba in history ? 
  millions . 
  his words are oddly quoted too , clearly by someone with an agenda . 
  `` red herring '' is a word that you will rarely find in historical journals , that 's argumentum ad neckbeardus . 
  arguments by logical fallacies only win arguments online , in history or in law , logical fallacies are n't the end all arguments , you can call anyone 's argument logically fallacious by throwing out some lists of logical fallacies , but that will never win you an argument . 
   there was no concerted effort to exterminate the congolese people - the belgians just brutalized them and killed them wantonly . 
  i can say that about ukraine and holodomor , but then i 'd get downvoted to hell on this sub ( for a good reason ) . 
  there was n't an concerted effort to wipe out the ukrainian people at all , stalin desperately needed ukraine because it was an economic powerhouse . 
  he just wanted to batter it into submission . 
  ukrainians were not racially discriminated against ( in a meaningful way ) either , so you could say it was a pretty good situation . 
  but was it ? 
  i do n't think holodomor was very good . 
  / r/europe needs to agree on definitions . 
  if holodomor is a genocide , so is the congolese genocide , even more so . 
  definitions of genocide vary . 
  i tend to be on your side - i believe genocide has to be a concerted effort to exterminate a people . 
  otherwise it 's just mass murder . 
  still evil of course . 
  however , recently it has come into fashion to describe mass murder as genocide , especially when it is politically convenient . 
  so when 100,000 poles die at soviet hands , it 's a genocide , but when maybe a million or more russians die , it 's not . 
  i 've had quite a few people insist russians were n't genocided even though ~ 20mil died in wwii and then maybe 1-2mil died under stalin . 
  i guess that was all accidental deaths . 
  i really ca n't tell you what is genocide anymore . 
  so in order to be fair to all , i will take the stance that * everything * is now genocide . 
   i understand the reasons but they are all soft/ambition/sentimental reasons and non of the one i 've heard are economical . 
  and i find this particularly disturbing .

  i only heared about some activists from united russia who tried to report stores for selling sanctioned products , but generally everything is still on shelves , kind of . 
  in my city most of finnish butter or lithuanian cheese is sold out already as people bought those in bulk . 
  * a vice-minister of economy development wrote on his facebook how stupid russian economic policy is and apologized to the citizens for ruined economy , and was immediately fired . 
  also illegally , the law forbidding criticism of government for officials was found unconstitutional by constitutional court .

  ] ( http://www.mintrans.ru/news/detail.php?element_id=22538 ), 
  soviets ' goal was to simplify and all the written languages to optimise mass-production of books , i 'm sure they had problems with arabic script . 
  they simplified russian also significantly , some characters were liquidated even to save on paper and ink literally . 
  looking from the inside i do n't see any person who considers stalin or chernobil as something foreign at a time , this all and many other soviet problems are taught in schools as ours problems and it ca n't be different as we all are affected . 
  though i can imagine you 're talking about people making counter-agruments when they see someone accusing russians as ethnicity in all the troubles in ussr related history , in this kind of arguments both sides are typically backwards nationalists . 
  and `` obama started maidan '' type of thing like the most of recent propaganda inventions are not a representation of what russians think , it 's made to influence what we think and at this scale of media control it works very effectively . 
  actually most of post-soviet nuclear projects are largely dependent on western technology like french turbines or german automation . 
  any event related to russian military is covered everywhere now and that 's reasonable . 
  though even your link says this event is usual and is planned in advance . 
  i would expect a larger than planned scale of the training if it 's related to current events but i do n't know what was planned and there 's nothing about that in the article . 
   mobilization of reservists i thought it 's a mistake in your translation , but you 're probably serious . 
  it 's not a mobilization but a [ military training ] ( http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%92%d0%be%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b5_%d1%81%d0%b1%d0%be%d1%80%d1%8b#.d0.a1.d0.be.d0.b1.d1.80.d0.b0.d0.bd.d0.b8.d0.b5 ) which are ran yearly no matter of current conflicts . 
  you make a very good news coverage , and you see what a terrible things are going on in russia , you do n't really need to exaggerate the neutral ones . 
   i do n't connect how this list of events and sources leads to russia 's willingness for a big war see / u/3dom 's previous news compilations , he loves to add tabloid style summary before the news , in sarcastic way . 
  i do n't watch russian tv news for a very long time , i did n't know about alternatives when i first became interested in news somwtime in 2000s and already all that was available on tv then is putin in multiple reports in every single news block , during the duma and president elections in 2011-2012 it was already impossible for any sane person to watch tv news because propaganda went crazy to the point of news host calling an opposition candidate hitler and putin calling people who do n't support him monkeys ( banderlogi ) in prime time news show on the most popular tv channel . 
  so i ca n't objectively tell you what 's going on in tv recently , that shit can give nausea and make you concerned about your mental health . 
  unfortunately it 's hard to avoid tv completely since my relatives watch it so i can tell you that any prime time show now is interrupted several times to tell urgent news in special voice which is typically used to dub classified experts to not reveal their real voice , and they tell mostly about ukrainian events , numbers of deaths and what bombs ukraine shot where . 
  all the other news in russian i get on internet in reddit-like community of people who share my views so most of new kremlin propaganda inventions discussed there are already discussed here as well . 
  by the way some of those truly propaganda-free shows were maximovskaya 's work back on old ntv until it was closed , then on tvs until it was closed , and even though her rentv show was clearly ( self ) censured it still was the best news show on mainstream tv . 
  i hope my impression of her did n't turn wrong since recent events , did n't watch the show for long time . 
  how turning the basket away can help when playing football if it 's higher than the goal and the pole is still in place ? 
  anyway i 'm more concerned about windows right behind the goals . 
  because terrorism threat you know ? 
  also you 're not allowed to take any photo on train stations or inside of a train , terrorists can use them to learn the location . 
  seriously , that 's the official motivation . 
  well i 'm ethnic russian and i was stopped , sure anecdotes do n't make statistics though . 
   russians are extremely racist against other russians from different regions it 's only a thing in moscow , less in st.petersburg , the reason is the state supported inequality . 
  if simplified all the state giant enterprises pay taxes in moscow , all of investments and social support goes to moscow , it 's the only city with decent wages ( average 2-5 times higher than average in other big cities ) and all of needed infrastructure , so people from all over the country relocate to moscow because they have no opportunities in their local cities and muscovites hate them for overcrowding the city . 
  also apartments in moscow are insanely expensive so locals who privatized apartments given by ussr are practically millioners and that does n't add sympathy of people whose property in other cities worth nothing in comparison , they think all of locals are rich , lazy and exploit all the other country , and muscovites think newcomers are poor because they are lazy and dumb . 
  it 's not required but police may harass you illegally if they think you 're suspicious and detain you for made up reason ( `` you look like a reported facial composite '' ) until you prove your identity . 
  never happened to me in other cities until i visited moskow and was questioned for papers on the 2nd day , officer not only wanted to see my passport but also a train ticket . 
   ukrainians are mongols never heard that , on the contrary `` russians are mongols '' is quite a popular narrative . 
  original referendum was scheduled too quick either . 
  troops on streets seriously frightened people and cutoff of ukrainian tv channels along with propaganda on russian ones was the most important violation . 
  most of people do n't care about politics and ca n't make an informed decision in such environment . 
  the same is true for elections in russia by the way . 
  i think the result could have been different . 
  russia had permission to have troops on the navy base , not to deploy troops on the streets or to capture administrations . 
  i beleive that many of crimeans liked the idea of joining russia but there were no referendum . 
  you ca n't just place troops on the streets , capture local government , make a million blanks on office printers , announce a vote in a week , run it without a proper observation and call that a referendum . 
  apparently it 's not default in russia and uk . 
  i 'm from samara and we did n't have any arthodox ` activists ' messing in our city , it 's just the artists were discouraged from visiting us by their previous experience in russia . 
  i mostly talk about random people on internet so i 've no idea if they learned this lesson , fortunately it was already obvious for my friends . 
  the sad part is no matter of our political beliefs we have ho say in the current policies , no matter if you talk about a concert or a war . 
  russia is in desperate need of lustrations , even late would be better than none . 
  though the author in some points tries too much to manipulate the facts under his theory :  the only one that has as such support is navalny - but that 's only because it sometimes happens to him snarl on `` black '' , mention something about a great russia and throw meat . 
  one would think a person with author 's ideas wo n't cite the kremlin propaganda inventions ... 
  behemoth concert got cancelled in my city , now i 'm looking forward the cradle of filth concert in autumn . 
  hell i know some fellow metalheads who made fun of madonna or elton john fans for their problems with orthodox activists , i hope now they understand how important it is to stand for civil rights even when it 's not your personal rights were violated .

  i share your attitude to modern usage of swastika like this but it seems you did n't read or understand the article you linked , your quote does not state that swastika is not a part of slavic culture , it states that the word `` kolovrat '' as a name for slavic swastika is n't authentic .

  unlike buses marshrutkas belong not to municipality or to a company but personally to the driver and he can do whatever he wants with it . 
  your numbers are way too low , number of all state workers is [ about 33mln people ] ( http://www.kp.ru/daily/26032.4/2948855/ ) ( link in russian ) if you count all state owned enterprises . 
  allegedly there were not enough time in dmitry kiselev 's 134 minutes long weekly news summary on a state owned tv channel with the biggest audience to tell anything about that moscow subway train accident . 
  political suicide only makes sense in democracies and not when you rig elections like putin used to . 
  also political suicide does n't happen by itself , it only happens via the media and since putin effectively controls all the media with significant audience in the country that 's not gon na happen . 
  having his resources you can convince majority of citizens in anything and without risking political suicide kill your opponents politically or phisically .

  for me it 's clear that the point of this video is not `` no to war '' but `` usa is enemy '' , `` putin do n't want war '' , `` war is necessary '' , `` russia is not currently involved in lugansk and donetsk actions '' , `` crimea actions are ok to the point of not being worth mentioning '' , `` simple people have a say in russia 's foreign policy '' , `` all of patriots want putin to go war on ukraine '' , none of which are true . 
  also it 's not a `` single guy from vk '' but a youtube account with no videos but high quality anti-ukrainian propaganda , with a link to vk group devoted to pro-putin , anti-western , anti-ukrainian and anti-opposition content which was created right after maidan . 
  i imagine game devs pay not nearly as good as our ministry of truth . 
   better than those mutilations-propaganda it 's not better it 's just targeted on youth internet users while tv propaganda is for conservative adults and hence made differently . 
  that 's too little to say about russia .

  ukraine is a word meaning `` borderland '' and thus refers to the actual region that the country is on rather than to the corporate entity of the country itself . 
  so properly speaking , in english it has a `` the '' . 
  ukrainian nationalists get their jimmies ruffled when they see `` the '' is added for a large number of reasons . 
  that is wrong , and the people who flip their shit about putting a definite article on the ukraine are blowing smoke . 
  it fits the english usage pattern of a country that gets a definite article , so it gets a definite article . 
  there is no shame attached to countries getting a definite article in english , or the united states and the united kingdom probably would have done something about it long ago . 
  remember , it 's `` the united kingdom '' , but there is no `` the '' in `` great britain '' . 
  and there 's always going to be a `` the '' in `` the ukraine '' . 
  i must have missed all the communist terrorist activity that happened in the last fifteen years .

  the problem is them constantly lying and twisting information for the purposes of propaganda .

  yes yes , onishenko is an idiot for saying that , * and also for not reading the material before making comments * . 
   but its still a ridiculous ban . 
  it 's really not . 
  protectionism is a reasonable policy , and this particular restriction does n't majorly affect the russian population . 
  it 's for medical clinics . 
  you yourself can buy whatever you want . 
  this is a continuation of the broken phone antics . 
  the consumer use condoms are neither banned nor restricted . 
  import of condoms ( and many other medical items ) for medical clinics is restricted . 
  so for example the ultrasound tests will be using localy made condoms .

  ` communism ' that you read about was never successfully implemented in the soviet union . 
  there are quite a few young people in russia who never experienced life under the soviet union who like to romanticise and idolise it . 
  i think communism caused the death and stagnation of eastern european culture to which we are still heavily recovering . 
  millions of people all suffered immeasurably for a meaningless facade of an ideology . 
  i think those who glamorise communism are naive ... 
  it is hard to say regarding the ussr . 
  i am proud of the actions of soviet citizens , such as their efforts in ww2 to which we all owe our lives to . 
  however , i recognise that stalin and lenin are psychopathic dictators who treated life as if it had no worth . 
  your anecdotal experiences are still not enough to generalise an entire country . 
  i 'm sorry that these experiences have affected you so deeply that you have so much mistrust and hate for russians , and i hope one day you will realise that there is far more that unites us than divides us . 
  russian people are not their government . 
  `` doublethink thrives in russia '' ? 
  how can you make such huge generalisation on a country with a population of 140 million inhabitants . 
  i know no russians who would cheer for dead ukrainians and as a russian myself i think whoever does that is morally abhorrent . 
  i feel sympathy for all deaths because people like choir singers are n't government officials . 
  they have no say in foreign policy . 
  they ca n't be held responsible and you 're a hypocrite for condemning russians for supposedly disregarding human life when you 're doing the exact same , but applying that to russian life . 
  the two are n't mutually exclusive . 
  it 's political foreign policy - they 're not government officials and they bear no responsibility for what 's going on in syria whether you agree with it or not . 
  beautiful . 
  may your souls be at peace countrymen, 
  it 's not my interpretation . 
  when people say that this death is their karma , they 're essentially stating that their affiliation in the russian government is enough to morally warrant death . 
  people who say `` karma '' are implying that they deserve to die , though . 
  people do n't deserve to die merely for being affiliated with the government . 
  irregardless they do not deserve to die because they are promoting a political stance that you do n't agree with . 
  what 's your point ? 
  did i claim they were apolitical ? 
  they have no involvement in what goes on there . 
  did i say they were apolitical ? 
  they 're the red army choir . 
  they represent their country - but they have absolutely nothing to do with what happens in crimea and syria . 
  anyone who tried to justify these deaths due to their own personal political agenda is disgusting . 
  these were n't government officials or soldiers - they were choir singers and volunteers for the homeless . 
  may they rest in peace .

   russia would fight corruption a day that i can only dream of . 
  this is barbaric . 
  however , i understand the difficulties of reversing cultural traditions - i used to learn spanish and my teacher ( who is from colombia ) revered the event as great fun and expressed wish to join in .

  some of you really have to learn what `` per capita '' means . 
  you are correct - sorry , i conflated the two . 
  but how do you get free movement of goods without free movement of people ? 
  it 's hyperbole , and in my experience i 've been treated with hostility when i said this , and on one occasion ( someone obviously thought i was a russian immigrant ) said something like `` if you 're going to live here speak our language '' . 
  nothing too bad but for some people it can be a touchy subject . 
  yeah did n't you know ? 
  we russians come out the womb hating ukrainians , raging war and invading georgia !, 
  it 's in our blood !, 
  it 's called hyperbole . 
  i obviously do n't hate all ukrainians considering i am ethnically part ukrainian and have family there . 
  but okay , disregard that part of my post .

  this is something i feel that is pertinent yet underlooked . 
  when we hear about attacks , we often classify them by severity by the number of dead . 
  however , we do n't take into account the individuals scarred physically and mentally for life . 
  so lucky to be born in such a beautiful continent . 
  with the corruption inherent within russian government , it is only logical to assume he did . 
  how else did he fund his multi-billion dollar black sea holiday home ?

  i said , `` is that it !? 
  what a modest man ! '', 
  outstanding the amount of money he has stolen from the russian people whilst masquerading as a `` patriot '' . 
  white people in europe !,

  it mostly contains factual information with exception of :  it is established beyond reasonable doubt that stalin intentionally starved to death soviet ukrainians in the winter of 1932-1933 . 
  soviet documents reveal a series of orders of october-december 1932 with evident malice and intention to kill . 
  by the end , more than three million inhabitants of soviet ukraine had died . 
  it forgets to mention : a ) that independent of the way of calculation of the victims ( statistics of deaths rarely use ` hunger ' as the cause ) . 
  twice as many ethnic russians died as ukrainians . 
  b ) the main reason for the hunger was bad harvest caused by drought . 
  c ) once it was known about the hunger - aid was supplied . 
  but in many cases too late ( the hunger started in autumn 1932 , but the aid started to arrive in spring 1933 ) . 
  how did hunger happen ? 
  the government took the quotas for land use ( which belonged to the state ) in kind . 
  the quotas were established based on the results of the cooperatives . 
  prior to the drought in summer 1932 already a strong black market for flour existed . 
  the individual farmers who did n't join the cooperatives were incentived to hide most part of their harvest so they can quern it later and sell the flour in the black markets . 
  the harvest of the cooperatives in 1932 was less affected by the drought because they had irrigation systems , pumps , tractors and other machinery . 
  so that caused local governments to set unrealistic quotas for the local farmers -- effectively taking away their food supply . 
  individual farmers starved causing soviet union population loss between 5 and 7 million people . 
  that fact led to investigation which finalized in 1939 , the culprits of the mass starvation were the leaders of the republics , among them ( in case of ukraine ) : [ stanislav kosior ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanislav_kosior ) , [ pavel postyshev ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pavel_postyshev ) and [ vlas chubar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vlas_chubar ) -- all executed . 
  was the soviet government responsible of the deaths of millions in this case ? 
  yes was it done on purpose to kill any specific group ? 
  no , at least there no facts that would sustain such affirmation . 
  i have read dozens of articles about that matter , the main argument i see in ukrainian internet , is that number of ukrainians in the census reduced , while number of russians increased very much . 
  which is while true forgets to mention , that many of those who were censed as ukrainians choose to be russians , because of the korenizatsiya program which imposed them to learn in ukrainian ( language that many of those who considered themselves ukrainians did n't know ) . 
  that is widely documented fact which is normally silenced in the modern ukrainian propaganda . 
  i also say that it is a propaganda peace , because it uses fact spinnings to place a sign of = between soviet regime and nazi germany . 
  which even tanking in consideration all the crimes against humanity during soviet union is not the case . 
   but the atomic bomb ended the war . 
  have you ever heard of [ manchurian operation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_invasion_of_manchuria ) ? 
  as you say :  did you know that the fire bombing of tokyo had more civillian casulties ? 
  the conventional bombing was just as powerful , as we can see in well documented bombings of dresden , for example . 
  the common opinion in russia , is that japanese army got crushed everywhere and the opinion about the nukes was done with no military but political purpose : 1 ) show the soviets ` new toys ' ; 2 ) ensure that rendition of japan will be to the us and not to soviet union , after our forces would have taken tokyo . 
  and that is to what i refer about trigger happy idiots . 
   that political agreement was n't formalized into memorandum . 
   i do not know of any formal memorandum . 
  do you have a source ? 
  there was no memorandum , the issue was supposed to be handled similar to how we retreated nuclear weapons from cuba , and then us did the same towards nukes in turkey . 
  as a source , read the [ words of gorbachev himself ] ( http://www.bild.de/politik/2009/bild-medienpreis/die-deutschen-waren-nicht-aufzuhalten-7864098.bild.html ) ( one of the last questions ) . 
   this is one view . 
  another view could be that russia is n't an adversary . 
   looking back with how the situation is now you may come to that conclusion . 
  putin certainly wants you to . 
  this is his interpretation . 
  but at the time , things were different . 
  russia was on it 's way to join nato , not towards a new cold war . 
  that view predominated in russia as well , until the colour revolutions and the missile shield with complete russian exclusion from talks . 
   to accuse foreign ngos of working against a country could be pure propaganda and would be in line of putin trying to accuse foreign countries of aggression , in order to justify his actions . 
  it could but imagine one of those environment organization that takes money from the outside at critical moment [ rises it 's head ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yevgeniya_chirikova ) and protests against putin regime . 
  so does some organization that helped children with cardiac problems . 
  and now under investigation is ` dynasty ' the most important russian science ngo , that secretly funded the non-system opposition . 
  in all cases it 's same scheme - us buys political capital through ngo 's by doing some activity good for pr . 
  later that political capital is used in us interests . 
  exactly the same situation i say happen in ukraine . 
  [ us gives money to ngo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dexrp27mmdu ) , that money is transformed in political capital ( through activities that are good for pr ) . 
  later that political capital is used to promote politicians , get people out in the streets , etc. 
  i 'm not saying that foreign involvement was the only factor that caused euromaidan , but it made it possible . 
  in bad faith . 
  for example , when yatsenuk says in agitation for aa with eu that [ wages and pensions will be 5 times higher ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azfc4cgihz4 ) - why no one stands and says that he is lying ( note : when he said the mean wage was around 500 euros in ukraine , which translates in promise a mean wage of 2500 euros ) . 
  another example , when yanukovich was overthrown , there was that [ document signed a day before ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agreement_on_settlement_of_political_crisis_in_ukraine ) by frank-walter steinmeier , your foreign minister . 
  why nobody stood by his word and demanded the complacency to the document by the opposition ? 
  as i said before , russian propaganda bases it self mostly on true facts , but with far-fetched conclusions . 
  it means , that our media spins the facts ( which in 95 % of cases are true ) , silences others and give them their own interpretation . 
  but those facts which are true do n't come from nowhere . 
   this was always the pipe dream of dangerous sociopath generals . 
  take out the other side first . 
  then they ca n't retaliate . 
  are you really sure that a us president would take that gamble ? 
  maybe get a mirv warhead or three or five on major us cities , just to take out russia ? 
  we are talking about a billion possible victims of a first strike . 
  with unclear consequences for the rest of the earth 's population . 
  i 'm sure you have seen that sketch about ' [ salami tactics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix_d_vmkswe ) ' . 
  if we do n't insist in maintaining the nuclear parity today , then tomorrow it will be something new , like laser aa-weapons in the orbit , ultrasonic drones with nukes , communications interference systems . 
  we miss one step and then we will be a dozen behind , like it happened with computers , it took russian labs 2 decades to reduce gap to 5 ( ! ), 
  years with intel . 
   we talked about that . 
  think of what a `` first strike '' would entail . 
  who would do that and why ? 
  the same trigger-happy idiots that bombed hiroshima and nagasaki . 
  the security policy matter is not take any chances . 
   but my points above stand . 
  with everything bad nato and the eu stand for , aggression towards russia is not on my list . 
  this is something putin came up with , to justify his aggression . 
  yes , putin found a mean to justify crimea and much more . 
  but it was n't on completely empty grounds , that 's my point . 
  and i stand by it , but i agree to disagree with you . 
   you think 15 years is enough to gain the trust of the west ? 
  if 15 years is not enough -- no amount of time will never be . 
  because interests of eu and russia in economic sense were , are and will be conflicting with each other , unless russia joins eu ( or eu -- russia , haha ... joke ) . 
  because in the first 15 years of russian federation existence as a country we had given up so much of our interests to the west and got nothing from it -- we wo n't try that again . 
  instead russia and eu will go their separate ways , conflicting that is . 
  and maybe , maybe in a couple of decades the world will become less hostile place and therefore common ground might be found . 
  or russia breaks on it 's way , or eu , or both . 
  never know . 
   your interests will be ignored as long as your country acts like a rogue state . 
  was russia rogue state through the 90 's to 2005 ? 
   everyone was . 
  9/11 was a game changer . 
  new york is home to the un . 
  many saw this as an attack on modern civilisation itself . 
  except russia was n't formal ally of usa , it had no duties or obligation to aid nato operation in afghanistan . 
  putin could have expressed his condolences and do nothing like china . 
  or even oppose invasion of afghanistan .

  well at least one of us is . 
  that was an example . 
  there were daily negative news like i mentioned 3 times already ? 
  you guys are fun . 
  you asked for an example and when i give you one you downvote me or want another one . 
  i bet you can use google as well as i can . 
  plus : i never said it was `` propaganda '' , stop putting words in my mouth . 
  i 'm not blaming the baltics actually , because i can see why they 'd feel treated . 
  i 'm just saying that the whole invading scenario is excuse my wording : bullshit . 
  anyways i 'm out ca n't have too much of this sub at once . 
  there are nato troops more or less all around russia and only really few in the baltics . 
  plus that ` buffer zone ' would be tiny , weapons those days have a pretty big range mate . 
  what would that be ? 
  getting the whole nato against you for some ports that do n't really matter , a few more habitants of whom 3/4 will hate russia, 
  point is : the us is flying in syria and bombing isis , al-nusra etc. 
  so they 're ` flexing their muscles ' . 
  i was n't talking about any regime changes or anything on that matter . 
  thank you . 
  i 'll probably just stop commenting on that topic , people either do n't want to get the point or they 're trying to troll me or something . 
  i feel like i 'm talking to a wall . 
  are you trying to troll me ? 
  or you do n't get the point at all . 
  are you serious ? 
  there was crap on a daily base about it . 
  i 'm not going to dig around for those news , but for example some famous us moderator showed a clip about a wolf in a hotel lobby being filmed by a american olympia athlet and they reported it as a happening in sochi . 
  he later said that it was a fake made by them , but it still got posted on quite a few news sites and other ridiculous stuff like that . 
  for showoff reasons , the same way the us does it in russian airspace etc. 
  has nothing to do with invading . 
  plus most of those cases happen in international airspace , just close to the nations airspace , they just still get reported ( like many international water cases ) . 
  or do you believe greece is about to invade turkey because they violate their airspace ( and vice versa ) . 
  i do n't say that it 's okay to invade non nato states . 
  serious guys , not sure if you just do n't want to understand me , or if you 're just acting . 
  you agree that there 's a way bigger risk for a country to invade a nato state to a none nato state , right ? 
  i 'm not pro any wars . 
  i 'm just naming facts . 
  hm so russia did n't gain anything ? 
  okay , if you say so . 
  list of european countries that have invaded european countries in the past 4 years without any possibility to gain anything in it at all , but a good chance to lose a lot : - you 're welcome . 
  i know , but they 're the same people , just that those in azerbaijan had some turkification going on in the past . 
  so they may be like turks , but are still kind of not , if you know what i mean :p, 
  i understand czech better than i do ukrainian ... but i get what you mean . 
  i do n't even want to hold a conversation with you . 
  all you say is : putin lies . 
  so ... what does it change about the fact that there are still no benefits in invading the baltics ? 
  erm that 's not my `` world view '' . 
  i 'm not saying russia really needs those things . 
  but some things are of obvious benefit to a nation while others are not and there is nothing of benefit for russia to gain in the baltics . 
  you can talk around it all you want . 
  ps : i have no clue how my comment made you believe that would be my world view, 
  okay , okay . 
  but they 're not . 
  that 's like saying portuguese and spanish are the same language . 
  actually you 're not . 
  azeris are more persian ethnic wise . 
  it 's not . 
  those are different scenarios . 
  you ca n't compare ukraine to estonia . 
  you would n't compare mongolia to japan either or would you ? 
  sorry with ` you ' i did n't mean you , but the person who did it . 
  erm i was talking about their airstrikes not about a full on invasion . 
  the exactly same thing was already answered by me a minute ago . 
  was crimea part of nato ? 
  are there any cruicial things for russia to gain there ? 
  russia already has ports in kaliningrad and around piter etc. 
  serious mate , there 's nothing to gain for russia . 
  azeris and turks like each other . 
  was crimea part of nato ? 
  do the baltics have anything to offer to russia that it needs like any special ports ? 
  no , there 's kaliningrad for that ( and others ) . 
  there 's nothing to gain for russia . 
  ps : whoever is now downvoting all my comments : you 're hilarious . 
  you need to check some of the polandball comics about hungary and romania, 
  why would you consider german worse ? 
  i know it 's more a personal taste thing , but still d :, 
  such is life in / europe, 
  compared to most nato states you 're actually quite capable ( us excluded for obvious reasons ) . 
  do n't know about lithuania , but in germany for example a verbal contract still counts as contract . 
  ( why would you downvote this comment ? 
  that 's a fact . 
  german law and stuff ( `` m\u00fcndlicher vertrag '' ), 
  us was flexing their muscles in syria way before russia 's intervention tho . 
  that 's not true , as a russian living in the `` west '' , i can tell you that the west has been shitting on russia ever since i can remeber , not as much as now ( because of the crisis in ukraine , georgia etc. 
  ) , but still . 
  just a little reminder as example : how much invented and completly false bullshit was on the news about sochi ? 
  there is nothing to gain for russia in the baltics and a sh * tload to lose . 
  i have no clue why you guys still serious believe in russia trying to invade you . 
  that 's a classic for me , not that i 'd like it , but i used to gift it to friends lol, 
  so do i , even tho i know there 's only crap in it , but it 's sooo good, 
  there are also some romanovs ( or relatives ) living in germany , because they were pretty german mixed . 
  ah okay , thank you mate !, 
   i assume you would hate everyone in europe i do n't think so . 
  would probably be a lot of gray . 
  see poles for example hate us ( for well known reasons ) while most russians do n't really care about poles ( expect for some who might see them as somekind of us vassal ) . 
  why are hungarians their `` cousins '' ? 
  serious question . 
  i mean they 're not even slavic , or did you mean something else ? 
  ( again , i 'm not trying to insult anyone at all , just curiose ), 
  because commies, 
   most murderous regime in the history of mankind ?!, 
  yes way worse than being conquered by the mongols or others similar to them .

  and then everybody will remember putin as a nice guy in comparsion . 
  i do n't see them punishing putin and his band . 
  they still have their property in london for example . 
  west ukraine ? 
  really ? 
  and ? 
  it is n't hate . 
  not even near . 
  every media is lying . 
  that 's their nature . 
  west supported yeltsin and his gangsters . 
  that 's why it ca n't be trusted ever again . 
  and this way give putin really strong support . 
  nice idea . 
  and western world do n't want to save them from evil putin ? 
  too bad , next time next guy is going to think before telling everybody the truth . 
  and think really hard . 
  who ? 
   there are those who seek to make out the ussr purely as a beacon of cultural beauty , industrious progress and might . 
  and there are people who paint ussr and everything that was there as absolute evil . 
  as far as i remember baltic counties became idependent in may 1990 , more than 26 years ago . 
  best way is to leave baby boomers in their country and move somewhere else . 
  that would mean some problems but what you have earned stay with you . 
  i think it 's possible to calculate optimal way to do it . 
  never . 
  soon . 
  nuclear-free world is the world where usa can terrorize entire world without any hope for better live for anybody else . 
  just because they can do that and nobody can do anything about it . 
  so no . 
  those who tried that have lost and gave up back in 1996 . 
  it 's absolutely pointless . 
  nope , in 1941 . 
  my grandfather lost one of his lungs . 
  my grandmother never meet her ex-classmates and friends because they all died in first days in that war . 
  and now some brain-dead idiot dares to say shit about it . 
  so he totally deserves it . 
  is it something bad ? 
  ca n't be done . 
  clones will be totally different persons . 
  west never wanted to be friends with russia . 
  that was just a stupid myth . 
  do n't expect any politician in russia be any different from putin . 
  they just represent different groups of oligarchs . 
  no point to apologise if nobody even listen to it . 
  katyn massacare is a good example . 
  and west will never apologise for supporting yeltsin and his `` reforms '' . 
  germany must be happy that they managed to get away with it so easily . 
  especially after what they have done in russia . 
  i know about all those rapes and shit and i do n't give a damn fuck . 
  because europe is an us colony . 
  if they do n't want to be with russia - they 're free to go and stab each other as much as they like . 
  most likely his family is from group ( or tribe ? ), 
  that opposed kadyrov 's group . 
  yeltsin fought it . 
  everybdy else were totally ok with letting chechnya go . 
  traditional taxi is aids . 
  that 's why almost all taxi in perm works in same way as uber . 
  i havent ' seen `` normal '' taxi for years . 
  yes . 
  russia was n't out of war in that moment . 
  all politicians are corrupted anyway . 
  we need a superintelligence ai . 
  most of corrupted politicians would be killed in stalin 's time . 
  that 's why . 
  you have to have place to live at least , most likely from ussr time . 
  it just is n't possible to live on 22k rubles if you pay market price for rent . 
  or i just do n't know how to do it . 
  teacher in russia is a low-paying job . 
  they do n't have choice but to tell what they told to say . 
  otherwise they 'll lose their jobs and only one source of income . 
  it would mean that european values means something and it 's worth supporting it . 
  and do n't forget which side you supported when russian people tried to get rid of corrupted government in 1993 . 
  but right now you help putin to stay in power . 
  your banks allow him to have secret police , propaganda , support from his circle . 
  and in eyes of russian people your `` values '' worth nothing because your only real value is money . 
  simple . 
  imagine that putin is gone , russia is now democratic and so on . 
  and try to explain why the hell you helped those bastards to stay in power here . 
  and why we should be friendly towards you after this shit . 
  i do n't see any of those `` european values '' while your banks help putin 's cronies to hide stolen money . 
  yup . 
  and when putin will be replaced someday nobody will return any money . 
  people tired but then yeltsin happened . 
  any movement towards democracy ended in 1993 . 
  putin did n't destroy democracy beacuse it was already dead . 
  absolutley . 
  and i do n't care . 
  basically exactly what happened with those who run against yeltsin . 
  no real difference . 
  why should i care about union of any sort ? 
  i 'm saying that i do n't care about how good or bad it was for other countries because i do n't live there . 
  after 2000 , yes . 
  but not in 90-s . 
  problem was that some people became filthy rich by using shady schemes while government used not less shady schemes and direct force to put people down . 
  and all of that was called `` democracy '' and `` market economy '' . 
  worst thing about it is that those people still considered as `` opposition '' or `` liberals '' or `` democrats '' by people outside russia . 
  why should i care about them ? 
  i do n't live in satellite states of the ussr . 
  pretty simple - ussr was shit but new russia was shitter for most people . 
  they have n't seen anything good from democracy or from market .

  what the hell are you talking about ? 
   many independent trustworthy and impartial organization parties have verified it they * interviewed * . 
  this is very different from verification of what actually happened . 
  it 's sad you ca n't understand the difference . 
   also a blog is your counter ? 
  so , if the questions are merely in a blog , they do n't qualify ? 
   so unless russian federal government recognizes them as victim are they victim to you . 
  and now you 're putting words in my mouth . 
  not good , not good at all . 
   because they are untrustworthy : convenient . 
  no , because what i have already said : not enough facts . 
   here testimonies those are not testimonies . 
  how do i or anybody else could verify those ? 
  they are anonymous . 
  should i just simply trust journalists ? 
  no , i should not , because there are numerous cases of them mis-presenting information or simply lying . 
  you should n't too . 
  for instance : `` small details that anzor did n't want to make public led the police to believe that he and one of his friends were gay , he said . '' what `` small details '' could possibly lead to this , huh ? 
   credible seems i think i have already defined what credible * is * , there is no need to guess what it may * seem * . 
  credible means having enough hard facts that could be verified by independent parties . 
  and no , by the way , if authorities ( russian or otherwise ) just say something without any facts , there is no reason to believe them too . 
  standards are the same . 
   only criminal convictions are good enough for you an actual investigation would be good enough . 
  no , what fbk did is not enough , [ there are too many questions ] ( http://oleglurie-new.livejournal.com/316667.html ) and not nearly enough answers . 
   so to convince you i need to go to russia myself , run an investigation myself and present all that to you personally . 
  no , just link some credible news report which reports * facts * . 
  like [ this . 
  ] ( http://v1.ru/text/newsline/652465.html ) ( there are no names here due to the obvious legal implications , but there is enough information to believe it actually happened . 
  address , date , time , name of the police officer , etc. ), 
   the testimonies of the victims are not facts ? 
  no , unless there is enough information to believe they are indeed victims . 
  hint : simply saying `` i 'm a victim '' is not enough . 
   so people saying the armenian holocaust did n't happen are true when people ca n't say names , dates personally that is . 
  there is actually a ton of information about this event ( including names and dates ) , and nobody sane is arguing about if it happened . 
  the argument is about it being an intentional genocide . 
   funny from a man who is himself widely seen as corrupt yet again , exactly zero facts presented , just empty accusations . 
  this is getting tiresome . 
   murders can be a hate crime . 
  they can be , but a hate crime is a much wider definition . 
  sweeping a black eye under the rug is very , very different from sweeping an entire body there . 
   anyway chechnya is russia right ? 
  still no concrete facts . 
  names , dates and such . 
  also , hrw is * not * related to un in any way , why are you repeatedly trying to present it as such ? 
  why do you call a letter * to * un as `` un responding to russia '' ? 
   corruption is done on a massive scale and condoned by the authorities . 
  [ fighting corruption is an interesting way to condone it . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_anti-corruption_campaign ), 
  hate crimes = / = murder . 
  please show me one case when murder was `` swept under the rug '' . 
  oh , and please do n't use `` sources '' without any factual material . 
   further i do n't think i need to explain to a russian the level of corruption in their country ... what you do need is to understand what corruption is , apparently . 
  nobody would break the law just for the sake of it . 
  or for some ideas . 
  basically , a ton of money should be involved somehow . 
   it is condoned . 
  many things are illegal , but condoned in russia . 
  it would be nice to have some source behind both statements . 
  i 'm not your comrade , mate . 
  because pretty much every family in russia has lost someone in this war . 
  tatars are rather nice people , actually . 
  they are quite secular , though , and well-integrated in our society . 
   there are much better russian culture subs . 
  do tell . 
   the overthrow of yanik was a neo-nazi led western supported coup funniest thing is that this is correct , if only technically . 
  well , there is quite a lot of new vestas and xrays around here ( tambov region ) , so there 's that . 
  i 'm not sure how showing up * at work * on sunday is related to voting * at the voting station * . 
  this one though is something completely different to what you 've described : `` all of them will be loaded onto buses and we should all vote for the united russia party '' . 
  namely , an attempt at voting fraud ( an attempt since nobody could catch them voting for a different party ) . 
   in russia , voting often happens during lunch time in factories - and if you vote wrong there is a chance you get fired . 
  hey from the parallel world . 
  in our russia , voting happens during weekends , and nobody is watching you . 
  ( that does n't mean that there is n't an election fraud at least in some places , of course . ), 
  i see you do n't get the difference between backing your own words with credible sources , and providing a wall of text that could or could n't be related to them . 
  this is sad . 
  next , you 're evading the question , which is what exactly norwegian soldiers forgot in afghanistan ? 
  next , fascism is far more specific than just a `` form of authoritarian corporatism under one strongman leader '' . 
  and if you get in the details , it would be obvious that possible similarities between contemporary russia and fascist italia are rather superficial . 
  next , there is no `` demonization '' of sexual minorities and/or liberals in russia . 
  finally , i 'm still waiting for the specific data about russia 's `` irrelevance '' . 
  cyclists in our city used this day as an excuse to have some [ fun ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pb8chdp.jpg ) !, 
  not a very good photo , this is probably a 1/20 of people who were participating . 
  sadly , i was n't there myself , so that 's the only photo i have , thanks to a fellow photographer . 
   abysmal human rights record towards lgbt , drug addicts , hiv positive , journalists , political dissenters etc. 
  it is good to back one 's words with sources . 
  please do . 
   us is the only country that is comparably aggressive and even it has stopped from outright annexing territory yeah , annexing territory is so much worse than bombing countries on the other side of the world and killing thousands of innocent people in the process . 
  oh , and us is not the only country doing this . 
  one word : nato . 
  what [ those guys ] ( https://ivarfjeld.com/2010/10/06/norwgian-soldiers-in-afganistan-told-to-be-wild-animals-for-viking-gods/ ) forgot outside of their country ? 
   putins ideology is pretty much classical fascism in the vein of mussolini because you say so ? 
  classical fascism is n't compatible with a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural coutry which is russia . 
   compared to pretty much any other developed and industrialized state russia is the largest european state by population and is nearly twice the size of germany yeah , because the size of the territory is what matters the most . 
  disregard that 3/4 of it is barely habitable , disregard that the size itself is a great strain on the infrastructure , disregard all those pesky little details . 
   but look how irrelevant you are in comparison . 
  ok , let 's look . 
  i 'm waiting for data about our `` irrelevance '' . 
  please do show where exactly we are on the scales . 
   even the small and comparatively irrelevant nordic countries have brought many more good things to the table . 
  like those vikings from the link above ?

  but even that does n't really matter - your government structure is way , way less potent than in russia . 
  your country is not ruled by politicians - politicians are simply hired managers , akin to ceo of a company who answers to the shareholders - yet the shareholders are not the citizens , but corporations and wealthy families . 
  remember how obama promised change and hope ? 
  do you really think that if he was free to act , he would involve the us in lybian & syrian wars ? 
  so , corrupt politician being punished in the usa is really not a big deal . 
  and the fact that hsbc only got a mediocre fine for blood money laundering , and noone even got jailed is telling far , far more about american corruption . 
  we tolerate putin 's corruption the same way you tolerate huge banks and companies corruption . 
  i mean , apple and google are very popular , as they bring the whole world new toys - who cares that they use tax havens ? 
  your system is far sneakier , and is actually really brilliant . 
  our corruption is out in the open ; yours is hidden behind proxies . 
   because to me the difference between putin and erdogan is nonexistant . 
  actually i too seem to see quite a lot of similarities . 
  they are alike , even if the power source is a bit different ( military vs religion )  i think the people can handle it and sooner or later they will . 
  yea , but not quite now , anyway . 
  and , well , the thing is not about a strong leader is that it 's easier to manage sneaky entities like international banks if you have that one . 
  i do n't find the american way of meaningless leaders that only decide some internal questions while external policies are dictated by corporations , and with untouchable companies , any better - while the strong leader can be jailed after a revolution or even just a change of power ( as you can see with a lot of strong leaders from the eastern europe ) , a company can not . 
  ah , ok , that clears it out a bit . 
  dunno why did i expect a constructive dialogue from / r/europe , really . 
  you expect to only talk to shills , it seems , as it 's so far easier to simply exchange insults . 
  i must sadly inform you that i 'm not that easily offended . 
  try ` yo mom ' joke next time . 
   being friendly does n't mean that you have to bend down and accept our values as your own . 
  yet , the west is not really friendly towards russia . 
  at least the media is not - and i 'm not only talking about the newspapers or partisan talk shows ( though those do n't help ) , but even on the more basic level . 
  for us , the west is personified by the usa , and that state was never friendly with us , apart from a short time right after the collapse of the su . 
  hell , just check the sheer amount of movies depicting russians as dumb brutes at best and corrupt criminal villains at worst . 
  and really , hostilities ? 
  there 's no war with the west that i 'm aware of other than the whole sanction thing . 
  we do n't view the west in general as the enemy , though usa is certainly an opponent at the least - and their meddling with ukraine that arguably led to maidan turning violent just proved it thoroughly . 
  i remember putin saying something along the lines of `` if we wanted to start a war , our tanks would 've taken warsaw in two days , but we 're not going to do that , it 's crazy '' - and european newspapers brimmed with `` putin claims russian tanks will take warsaw in two days !, 
  '' , which caused poles to demand for heavier nato presence . 
  that 's how hostile russia is and how amicable the west is . 
   we do n't want to destroy russia , we want a friendly neighbour who we can trade with , not one who threatens us every now and then . 
  yea , ideally . 
  yet the eu put the sanctions on russia , using that peaceful trade as a weapon . 
  i do n't mind sanctioned individuals , they deserved it - but sanctioning access to the banks ultimately punished the common people without even touching the government . 
  did you hope that we 'd start the revolution ? 
  bad miscalculation . 
  and why ? 
  because you ca n't stand bloodless takeover of the crimean peninsula , while waging real bloody wars in the middle east for decades ? 
  was that , i dunno , jealousy ? 
  ukraine was n't even part of the eu . 
  and the eu does n't even want it . 
  yet you are eager to start punishing us ... did noone really see what was coming afterwards ? 
  our propaganda used this to utmost effect - it really fueled the whole `` us vs them '' attitude . 
  were those sanctions really worth it ? 
  where was the eu when ukrainian economy was supported exclusively by russian infusions ( that 's not our propaganda , that 's what [ head of imf actually said ] ( http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/imf-chief-lagarde-hurdles-blocking-economic-growth/ ) ) for 15 years ? 
  where 's the whole `` russia is hostile to us in the west '' when referendum on eu association with ukraine failed ? 
  it seems to me that the eu is ready to exert its power to punish russia over ukraine , but not to actually help out ukraine when it 's in dire need . 
  i do n't deny that our current stance towards the west is hostile . 
  yet it 's mutual , not a one-way street . 
   furthermore , yes , ukraine right now is in a bad place . 
  but you ca n't deny that the annexation of crimea and the proxy war in the east has nothing to do with it . 
  annexation of crimea did n't influence ukraine all that much . 
  most nationalists were actually elated to have the `` unproductive drones with russian slave mentality '' removed , they just wanted the land back . 
  the ato in the east , on the other hand , does influence its economy . 
  it also shifts the power structure . 
  yet both these events do n't prohibit the country from initiating reforms or lustration , as the current government proclaimed . 
  only enemies of the current government are punished , and corruption is so huge , the baltic-born minister of finance just retired to not deal with it . 
  can you also blame the rebels ( ok , with russia , if you want ) for that ? 
  the failure of ukraine is not because of rebellion in the two small regions , but because nothing at all has changed in its power structure - some crooks were replaced with different ones . 
  if there were at least some positive changes in the ukrainian government , which failed due to lack of money or shifting the country to military rails , you might 've had a point - but they 've not even been started . 
   i wo n't lie , i do n't like putin . 
  as far as i can see he has led russia in a very hostile manner for the last few years . 
  i do n't like him too . 
  i might have liked him in his first two terms , but not nowadays . 
  some of his internal policies are heavy-handed , and someone else could 've handled it better . 
  his decimation of the journalists will have a long-term negative effect on the country , as well . 
  but i do n't think anyone could handle the western hostility ( see what i did here ) without sucking up , as was usual . 
  and anyway , he 's not as bad as most alternatives - the mildest guy who had a chance to replace him peacefully ( prokhorov ) was a diehard capitalist in the worst sense of the word , favoring 6-day work week for proles . 
   if you were a good little sheep that did n't make a fuss then you are right that it was n't that bad with a little oversight here that over 99 % of the population were those `` good little sheep '' . 
  you really , really overestimate the number of people prosecuted by the state , especially after the stalin era . 
  at its peak , gulag system had 1.6 million people convicted - and not only political prisoners , like many assume , but common criminals , from swindlers to bandit murderers . 
  just as a comparison , right now usa has over 6 million prisoners . 
  yes , you ca n't compare the conditions , soviet prisons were actual hell - yet it was not by far as widespread as media makes it . 
  and after the gulag system was dismantled , the number of prisoners sharply fell . 
  so actual people who were thrown to prison to rot for their views were not that common , just by sheer numbers . 
  after stalin 's death , in a group of 1000 people , maybe one was convicted for political reasons ; there were other ways for the state to show its displeasure - by inhibiting promotion or shuffling to menial jobs , disallowing participation in international or state-wide activities , public shaming ( which was a really big thing then ) etc - and it 's not something altogether different to an american announcing himself a communist in the 60s . 
  was it intimidation of people for their political views ? 
  yes , it was , and it was shameful . 
  was the prison term possible ? 
  yes , it was . 
  yet unless you actively sought confrontation with the state , you were generally left alone . 
  of course there were outliers , of course there will be anecdotal evidence of people been framed etc. 
  but stalin era was not the whole soviet union . 
   the problem people have nowadays with putin is that he 's emulating some of the behavior the ussr had and that worries a lot of eastern europeans . 
  and again , russia is not ussr , and does n't even strive to be . 
  there are almost no signs of going that way other than desire for a large powerful state , whatever the rednecks might say . 
  i do n't see what kind of behavior emulating the su you see - propaganda fever , maybe ? 
  i see nothing else that can be construed as `` back to ussr '' mode . 
  russia is a pure capitalist state . 
  even evil putin does n't go around in military uniform , he wears a business suit - for a good reason . 
   there is no reason to not be a pro western ally . 
  uhm , there are many reasons not to . 
  starting from having different set of values to being put off by consumer society as a whole . 
  i 'd say there are less reasons not to be than to be , and in the spirit of your answer that 's true . 
   there was no reason to attack ukraine during their inevitable change to a pro western country other than to try and keep the old world order alive . 
  inevitable change to a pro-western country ? 
  we might talk about different ukraines here . 
  ukraine now is more corrupt than 3 years ago .

  russia is the territory marked as `` here be dragons '' and `` inhabited by dog-headed people '' on my map . 
  i 'm half-joking , of course , but such a separation is one of the main problems nonetheless . 
  he 's right on this one . 
  i expected to see varg vikernes in here . 
  speaking seriously , if i were google i 'd rather choose one between thor heyerdahl , nansen or amundsen as the right answer . 
  maybe it 's just me but these three names come to mind first . 
  easy there , cowboy . 
  take a deep breath and calm down a little . 
  as far as i lived through the 80s , 90s and 00s , i feel confident enough to have an opinion and share it from time to time . 
  do n't even get me started about siberia . 
  have you ever been there ? 
  since the fall of the ussr , many places turned into complete shitholes , as they were n't needed out there from the start . 
  meanwhile , the oil-rich regions are doing just fine . 
  it 's not a coincidence , that is how the economy works . 
  whatever it was , the russian north are slowly dying , regardless of efforts to put it back on rails . 
  as for dictatorship ... omitting the fact that any dictatorship shows a worse result in the long run , one of the problems is that human behavior is not predictable . 
  once your dictator lost touch with reality and the country is rolling down the hill . 
  so it goes . 
  and that 's what is going on now . 
   he stole $ 500 000 from the russian people you fucking idiot !, 
  phew . 
  that 's the price of good apartments in moscow . 
  even though it were true ( which i doubt ) i could only conclude that he 's awful at stealing and would make a good president . 
  he has n't done enough to prove his relevance . 
  what did kasparov do apart from talking ? 
  perhaps , he did but i have n't heard anything about that . 
  it 's a bad sign , considering that i 'm at least somewhat interested in the political scene in russia , making certain efforts to find the info . 
  i think that kasparov has about zero credibility left . 
  imo , of course . 
  he fled the country anyway , so his political activity is n't worth bothering about . 
  in the best case it would be navalny but taking into account our famous ` luck ' it would n't rule out strelkov or someone like him . 
  try google translate . 
  2 ) maybe i put it in a wrong way . 
  he remains a nationalist but it 's not the main field of activities anymore . 
  his struggle against corruption is well-known and this is that attracts a lot of supporters . 
  i keep going to these `` racist marches '' ( which are called as russian marches ) , although , for the most part , it 's just a tribute to the past . 
  at least , the last one was clearly disappointing . 
  perhaps , you should read more [ about him ] ( https://navalny.com/ ) . 
  he ceased to be just a `` right-wing guy '' a long time ago . 
  he is the most prominent and promising leader of the opposition , who 's got 27 % of votes in the moscow mayoral elections without a single appearance on tv , by using only the internet and street promotion . 
  in [ a video you 're talking about ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ilxqieemg ) , he simply proposed to ease gun control laws ( it is an idea which i wholeheartedly support ) and made it in a comic style . 
  obviously , he had in mind aggressive men of north caucasus origin , supposedly muslims , who are widely hated for their violent behavior . 
  risking to cause an uproar on this sub , i dare say that the role of the person in charge is quite exaggerated by the west in case of the present-day russia . 
  personally , i 'd like to see navalny as a president , although many others would disagree with me , but that 's not the point . 
  i 'm much more concerned with how easily the power was usurped by a person who appeared out of the blue . 
  our dear leader can rightfully take a latin ` veni vidi vici ' as his motto . 
  so far as we see , it 's completely wrong that the structure of governance has allowed it to happen in the first place . 
  it should n't happen like this , but it does . 
  i 'm almost sure it 's a common practice everywhere , given the technical possibilities . 
  they `` do this just in case '' . 
  could you please refrain from speaking in such a manner ? 
  i merely stressed that you compare apples and oranges . 
   leave their phones at home it mostly goes to state employees or those who 're going to get a job like this in the future . 
  as for the rest ... 
  i do n't think it matters . 
  they can put anyone in jail , regardless of the protest activity or collected evidences . 
  re-read my comment please , then type \u0421\u0418\u0417\u041e in google images search . 
  that 's exactly why i compared the latter to \u0413\u041a\u0427\u041f , not with gorby ... 
  yeltsin was a huge step ahead as compared to gkchp . 
  anyway , * that * country was already ruined . 
  if you see no difference then you clearly have no clue about conditions in the russian jail . 
  once arrested , you may never return back home . 
  even though you were innocent from the start . 
  it certainly makes a difference . 
  some placards were directly accusing our glorious leader ... 
  cops do n't need ids , they gather information about participants by using data of the cellular network . 
  the same thing happened in ukraine , when authorities were sending sms to the people whose phones were within the recieving range of the mobile base stations around the maidan square . 
  edit : a word, 
  we had around 100-200k back in 1991 and this number was enough for success . 
  call me snobbish , but moscow ( and spb for some extent ) has an upper hand here . 
  you 're wrong . 
  there was the [ `` russia '' hotel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rossiya_hotel ) , by now demolished . 
  hello guys !, 
  here are some [ photos from the rally ] ( https://imgur.com/a/a7omd ) . 
  also , i just finished editing [ a short video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh--hjzjirw ) . 
  edit : 50k seems a plausible number . 
  edit2 : had to wait in queue for more than an hour before went through the security checkpoint . 
  it was n't cold today but all that waiting out there was a bit boring . 
  ps : i heard a lot of people around me joking about `` we all are nation traitors and enemies of the russian people '' . 
  like , we 're a `` fifth column '' and that queue was barely moving because the cops had to check the id and make a photo , in order to make it easier to find us in the future . 
  it was weird but funny . 
  pps : oh , just noticed i got gilded . 
  thanks !,

  nice generalizations you have there . 
  i could n't care less about what russia said . 
  it 's a joke , dude . 
  great video , thanks a lot !, 
  the shtick with the boxes deserves `` oskar '' . 
  perhaps , my confusion stems from the fact that many countries , from which europe currently takes the migrants , are deeply religious . 
  by the way , in regards to the birth control issue , the hardline christianity is just as bad as the hardline islam .

  yes , they are , the redheads . 
  unfortunately , a bear stomped on my ear , and sudden urges of this kind are now punishable by imprisonment . 
  there 's a [ localized version of `` vesti '' ] ( http://www.gtrkmariel.ru/news/conduct-of-mari-el-in-the-mari-language/news-of-mari-el-mar-25-09-2015/ ) being aired in the mari language . 
  sadly , it 's a gov ' t propaganda channel ...

  but other people notice , that at the every remembrance of the word `` russian '' this man by some reason starts to choke with saliva and intensively shake his head . 
  not very convincing . 
  let me explain it in simpler terms . 
  do n't feel sorry for russia , feel sorry for you . 
  liars are bad people , people do n't like liars . 
  do n't be a liar , be a good boy , always say truth . 
  millions of people live in suburbs , it does n't stop them again . 
  even the absolutely unqualified force like guards and street cleaners gets more . 
  i do not said that you lied in the comment i first replied too . 
  i said that you need to stop lie because of political agenda if you want your opinion would matter something . 
  an opinion can not be a lie , neither yours nor anybody 's . 
  the problem is that you also write facts that do n't correlate with the objective reality . 
  that 's what is called ` lie ' . 
  people who are ready to work for 8k do n't deserve better . 
  majority still somehow manages to find normally paid job . 
  you need to stop lie because of political agenda before your opinion matters . 
  it was the nuclear war of 1880 that burned all the trees , but now they have grown again . 
  the old good `` no , you '' argument . 
  everyone who stood at euromaidan is a useful idiot . 
  the financing supposes other spends and outcomes than buying cannon fodder . 
  how ? 
  countries want nothing . 
  you need a brain to want something . 
  countries are abstract things , they have no brain . 
  so it presents truth . 
  even though it looks like socialistic shit , it is an almost inevitable thing for the age of robots and all the countries will start it soon or later . 
  in my games there are always ten-twelve states in those territories . 
  or , if i play as muscowy , one , but it 's not some `` commonwealth '' . 
  start it on ukraine . 
  wait , wales is a country ? 
  is n't it an english county ? 
   fake account . 
  no this account is pretty real . 
  and russia is far from the only thing i post about i wonder if they write in your instructions `` try to look like real men , write something about portugal between propaganda posts '' . 
  as i understand , he means it was the worst russian movie on imdb in the common rating of all films , thanks to americans who saw that on mystery science theater 3000 , without understanding even basic things , like why the hut has chicken legs and what the sorceress lives there . 
  ps still shit film in my opinion . 
  because norway never had the dutch disease . 
  of course , if to remember that arabs are semites . 
  navalny does n't exist after the crimea question . 
  in political sense he is dead meat . 
  josef stalin is a name of the series of heavy soviet tanks of wwii years . 
  stalin played hoi . 
  do n't true croatians use `` chai '' ? 
  well . 
  russian writer paustovsky was really a soviet writer paustovsky , and like all soviet writers , was a big prostitute . 
  so , there 's no wonder , he imagined some yunkers with eyes full of cocain ( maybe in cocain delirium himself ) . 
  sergei ivanovich mamontov , who despite ` russian writer ' paustovsky wrote his memoirs in the truly free country , has the other opinion about authorship of the phrase . 
  what is satire ? 
  `` hit jews - save russia . 
  khokhols listened and said that the idea is ok , but the target sucks . '', 
  by the way , it is not `` a russian proverb '' but the sentence of nestor ivanovich makhno , the ukrainian anarchist who tried to create his own state on the territory of modern ukraine in the age of russian civil war . 
  those penis wookiees . 
  it is not some good and wise politicians . 
  it is some cunning and sly politicians that promote themselves with scandalous obviously stupid projects ( while adding popularity among some fundamentalists and other marginals ) . 
  [ here ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/41orrx/crimeans_want_more_love_from_russia/cz46uu6 ) is the link to the comment where i tried to explain how much exactly it does and why . 
  there are shortages . 
  crimean morning peak of power consumption is 1100mw , it normally produces about 20 % of its own consumption , so about 220mw . 
  currently all the generators that were contained exactly for the situation like that are on and generate about 200mw . 
  in december 2 2015 one power line from kuban to crimea was opened , it gave 220mw . 
  another one with the same power was opened in december 15 2015 . 
  so , the current power budget of crimea is 220 + 200 + 220 * 2 = 860mw against 1100mw of consumption on the peak . 
  those 240mw of deficit were covered by ukraine 's supplies through the old lines ( after one of them was repaired ) . 
  but ukraine stopped it , broke the contract with russia and demanded new one , where it will be written that crimea is the part of ukraine . 
  putin ordered the poll of crimeans about the choice of two : signing the contract in the way ukraine wants it or suffering from those missing 240mw until july 2016 when another two lines will be opened , both 220mw . 
  now , about what is suffering . 
  as 1100mw is the morning peak , really it is a bit lower . 
  the government started the power economy program and stopped electric vehicles like trolleys instead doting petrol ones . 
  as the witnesses say it is about 2-3 hours of blackouts per 2-3 days . 
  it can be checked , for example , there : http://sevstar.net/article/3890 ( one of sevastopol providers uses its own hardware to create an interactive map of power access in sevastopol ) . 
  i do n't know if russia would , but i would easily . 
  ten referendums , a hundred , a thousand , only pay . 
   say you live in uk your entire life but you have dual citizenship . 
  if you get arrested , you have no rights to contact the consulate because you are russian . 
  sounds very fascist . 
  i thought the uk is a democratic country . 
  of course . 
  i would n't mind it too . 
  if people want to see 90 % thing again they can see it , the only problem is money any state spends to hold such a big act like a referendum . 
  so , why not ? 
  there are also another ideas for referendums . 
  for example , will the us be a federation or a confederation ? 
  is slavery forbidden in the us or allowed ? 
  the important question , what if some minorities in the us have their own opinion about it ? 
  we * must * know . 
  however , it ai n't gon na happen . 
  it is the example of how the information war goes . 
  this article is formally right , though it chooses the facts to show and shows them in the specific order to create the opinion that is totally opposite to reality . 
  i can repeat you again , electricity is up and running since december 20 , 2015 , you can find as much links to articles of honorific western newspapers that prove the opposite , but reality will be the same . 
  what i said is fact , it can be easily checked . 
  this article just has no facts that relate to the topic and it can be easily checked as well . 
  it is good when you know what you are talking about when you talk . 
  once you are russian you can have another citizenship . 
  sadly , almost all comments in this thread ( including that one that started the branch ) have the same correlation with reality as your one . 
  electricity is up and running since december 20 , 2015 . 
  gladly , if the us will pay for it . 
  it 's probably because of the role rivers ( and riverboats ) had in medieval russia .

  a broken clock is right twice a day . 
  lots of second , third and fourth sons of gediminid princes served the grand prince of moscow as civilian administrators or military commanders . 
  several famous dynasties like golitsyn , kurakin , trubetskoy were started by lithuanian expats . 
  because it 's one of the worst crimes you can commit . 
  nah , it does n't exist any more . 
  russia worked hard to ensure that . 
   though i wonder how many countries/people germans have fought ? 
  all of them , probably . 
  i would consider austria to be the successor of hre , since modern germany was formed by brandenburg/prussia that inherited the lands of to . 
  i wonder if the panhandle would be militarized heavier than panau . 
  and your surplus princes served the rulers of moscow well .

  kalashnikov is not a russian rifle . 
  it was designed by an ethnic russian for the soviet union . 
  even aks produced in the su were n't assembled exclusively by russians . 
  soviets were n't just russian . 
  most of them were russian , since russia was the biggest country in the su , but stalin was n't , beria was n't , dzerzhinsky was n't , mikoyan was n't , chernyakhovsky likely was n't either . 
  those chechens who came back as decorated veterans to their emptied villages and had to follow their families to flat and dry kazakhstan were soviets as well . 
  step 1 : put a human on mars step 2 : put a living human on mars step 3 : put a living human on mars and return to earth step 4 : put a living human on mars and return to earth with the human step 5 : put a living human on mars and return to earth with the human still alive, 
  * sigh * russia must apologize for the soviet crimes because we 're the legal successor of the ussr , inheriting both its perks and its bloody past , but i strongly object to calling soviet crimes russian crimes . 
  maybe because you were a bad student and skipped history class that day ? 
  stalin 's deportations are well covered in the books , except for the polish operation , for some reason . 
  what ? 
  not gold , myrrh and frankincense ? 
   there 's not the same level of panic as there was in late 2014 , which is a positive sign , among others . 
  we 've run out of fucks to give . 
  my biggest disappointment is that renato does n't actually have a big moustache . 
   guerilla warfare gorilla warfare . 
  it 's a cat we 're talking about . 
  metalworks are important for defense . 
  a few well-placed bombs would isolate the city completely . 
  sorry , you can not join our club . 
  some are dead . 
  some have n't been empires for so long they 're no longer butthurt . 
  i do n't know if portugal is still butthurt , maybe just about goa ? 
  now that 's a good candidate . 
  no , this empire is gone . 
  italian state does n't consider itself a legal successor of the roman empire , or does it ? 
  i think ukraine should be renamed \u039b\u03b5\u03bc\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 to match \u039b\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 better . 
  we should start a butthurt former empires club with them . 
  is there anyone else we can invite ?

  many russians know that [ lenin was a mushroom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lenin_was_a_mushroom ) , so who knows how many of * questionable personalities * in history were secretly mushrooms ? 
  give me cause , profligate !, 
  true to caesar !, 
  be careful not to make a sound !, 
  in addition to what reineblanche suggested you could try ( depending on your tastes/interests/weather at the time you 'll be here ) : * kolomenskoye museum/reserve/park * tretyakov gallery * pushkin museum + art gallery of the european and american countries of the xix-xx centuries ( if you like impressionists ), 
  caucasus maybe ? 
  * mountains ? 
  check !, 
  * beards ? 
  check !, 
  * not very tall but pretty broad ? 
  check ( more or less ) * love to fight and to trade ? 
  check as well , i guess, 
  no , it just divides your flag into * four * red ones, 
   thunderous applause do you want prequel memes ? 
  cause that 's how you get prequelmemes, 
  and therefore very gorgeous !, 
  i 'm not arguing that we have n't or that we did get something from it ( that 's a different discussion , and i 'm pretty sure how would it end up ) . 
  plus , i do n't really like the comment above you . 
  but two questions : 1 ) as a person , do you only admit mistakes and apologize , when you get something from it ? 
  2 ) nazi germany existed from 1933 to 1945 , the germans are feeling the echo of the past even now , why do you feel that if we as a nation wanted to take the same path , it would n't be even harder to gain trust , considering that soviet union lasted much longer than a single decade ? 
  a ) i 'm not sure i can make a valid estimate on all ( at least the main ) state mass-media in russia , as they 're a toxic cesspool i 've been trying to avoid at all costs for a long time . 
  however , from my point of view they never even tried to carefully represent '' * why * you feel this way '' . 
  b ) i wonder actually if there was a way they could have handled it , even be they the most benevolent mass media russia had . 
  c ) i think part of it comes from a failure to find a new identity and a new way of looking at it positively . 
  a random thought `` okay , maybe we were assholes and they hate us for reason '' would stop in a deadend of a question `` ok , now what ? 
  what should i do with that knowledge '' then come questions `` was that really that bad ? 
  what choice did we have ? 
  [ insert some generic whataboutist questions too ] etc etc '' . 
  i believe lack of moral authorities left people alone with this questions , and made them somewhat deaf to arguments about `` why they feel that way '' . 
  d ) in some cases this indeed might turn to `` abusive ex-husband '' ideology . 
  however , i believe it 's more the case of russia-ukraine relations and i 'm not sure how many people would relate to it ( trying to get an honest answer even from a close person on this might be like walking on a minefield ) , but i 've got some hope left that this might be quite a marginal point of view , still . 
  as for baltics , i do n't think we ever regarded our relations with you as a `` proper marriage '' . 
  thanks again !, 
  ha , so i guess that 's what you get when you send poor pioneers by land , instead of rich naval trade expeditions . 
   \u9102 was the other one attested , meaning `` startled '' ha , * suddenly * \u4fc4 does n't look that bad after all !, 
  better be unexpected pita ( after all , that 's not so far from truth ) , than startled weaklings . 
  unfortunately , i ca n't read much of chinese ( recognize a few characters , is the most one can expect from me ) , or at least , i need a webpage to feed to chrome translator . 
  also , wiki mentions that before those conflicts there was an expedition by [ ivan petlin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivan_petlin ) in 1618-1619 , who reached ming dynasty china , but unfortunately failed to establish proper diplomacy ( as he was not prepared , and by the time he reached the capital , he did n't have a good tribute to be allowed to meet the emperor ) . 
  it 's stated though , that they managed to make contact with some officials and even brought back a document from the court , which could n't be translated for years to come , until russia became serious about china . 
  from [ this discussion ] ( https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/53932/how-does-found-in-a-cabbage-patch-look-look ) , variations of it can be found in english ( `` found in a cabbage patch '' ) and french ( `` les filles sont n\u00e9es dans les roses et les gar\u00e7ons dans les choux '' ( `` girls are born in the roses , and and boys in the cabbages '' ) ) . 
  in russian , we have it the same way as in polish : either brought by a stork , or found in a cabbage / among the cabbages ( * v kapuste * ) . 
  no gender differences . 
  thank you for your clarification , that makes sense . 
  so , if the old form is used for modern russia , it means that either a person does n't know/care about all this stuff , or is using it out of courtesy/flattery , right ? 
  and no , i could n't care less about this `` true \u56fd '' stuff myself ( i mean greatness and all that ) , i prefer normal name anyway . 
  also , think about it , \u4fc4 is a remnant of a junk sound that mongols added to make it pronounceable for them , it 's not even part of our real name . 
  now that 's humiliating , a bit . 
  however , come to think of it , we still have n't changed russian name of china from kitay , so that makes us somewhat even . 
  well , tidder-wave explained the chinese variant , but there 's a story about old japanese name for russia , which was rather offensive ( now only kana name is used , roshia , \u30ed\u30b7\u30a2 ) . 
  iirc , they basically followed the same scheme as the chinese ( taking first syllable and adding \u56fd character , koku ) . 
  so , ro character in rokoku was written as [ \u9732 ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%e9%9c%b2#japanese ) bare/naked , so basically it was smth like `` barren land '' ... no wonder our relations never were too nice . 
  thank you !, 
  i was wondering where on earth did that e come from , and why are we not just luosi instead of eluosi . 
  btw , if i understand correctly there were many variants how initial `` e '' could be rendered in chinese characters . 
  i also see that the \u4fc4 character means `` suddenly , ( very ) soon , presently '' according to wiktionary . 
  is there any story for why this character was used ? 
  may i ask , are you a native speaker or do you have anything to back your claim ? 
  because if that statement is based merely on google suggestions for \u4fc4\u56fd , then i believe you might have misunderstood the reason for it . 
  anyway , there are few reasons why i doubt your version . 
  first one , if you type \u4fc4\u56fd ( eguo ) in baidu , which is an actual chinese search engine , you 'd see the results refer to modern russia , not russian empire ( plus , baidu has its own wiki , baike , which [ happens to clearly refer ] ( http://baike.baidu.com/item/%e4%bf%84%e5%9b%bd ) to modern russia/russia in general for \u4fc4\u56fd / eguo term ) . 
  second , even linguistically \u4fc4\u56fd refers merely to russian country ( \u4fc4 / e = first syllable of eluosi and therefore shorthand for everything russian ( `` e '' nation ) , \u56fd / guo = country/state ) , as u/beaglers already explained . 
  therefore , even if \u4fc4\u56fd is a more archaic form , and was more in use in the imperial time , it 's just because that was more customary back then , especially for major trade destinations . 
  finally , why google gives you russian empire articles for \u4fc4\u56fd is because it finds them related to \u6c99\u7687\u4fc4\u56fd / shahuang eguo/tsar [ ist ] russia and \u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u5e1d\u56fd / eluosi diguo/russian empire which are the actual terms for the russian empire . 
  this was what i 've found on subject , by googleing , baiduing , wikiing and trying to understand the information . 
  if an actual chinese person would correct me , i 'd be happy to admit any mistakes . 
  however , i 'm pretty confident , that i 'm right on this one . 
  plus , my arguments still stand . 
  i 've lurked a bit through your post history . 
  so , i understand that you 're living in beijing now , so you must know chinese pretty well . 
  so , i might be wrong in the end . 
  it 's just that i 'd still trust a native speaker from mainland china more , however . 
  32.5 kk for e luo si vs 21.8 kk e guo ( simplified characters ) on baidu, 
  i 've heard that variant , e luo si , too before ( even though i 'm not a chinese speaker ) . 
  at least , google fetches 214kk results for \u4fc4\u7f57\u65af ( e luo si , simplified spelling ) , plus 30kk for \u4fc4\u7f85\u65af ( e luo si , as well , traditional chinese ) , while only 15.3 kk for \u4fc4\u56fd / 5.3 kk \u4fc4\u570b ( e guo ) . 
  maybe , this variant is used to appease gullible russian statesmen/businessmen , that they are respected ? 
  at least , no one calls higgs boson `` god particle '' these days . 
  that triggered me much more back in the days . 
  also , i 'm pretty sure lots of guys at cern liked steyns gate , so why not ? 
  actually , that applies to flags mostly . 
  many of those on the map are not flags but coats of arms , really . 
  different genre , different standards . 
  i 'd say , concept of skyline ( in its american sense ) is pretty foreign for moscow architecture in general , with a few exceptions maybe . 
  i believe , they pretty much make a noticeable skyline landmark for a lot of places in the western direction ( szao , zao , yuzao and western part of tsao ; here 's [ panorama from vorobjovy gory ] ( http://mosprogulka.ru/pictures/one/smotrovaya_ploshadka_vorobievih_gor_2.jpg ) , here 's [ cathedral of christ the savior ] ( https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/25407/84525178.c3/0_b45c9_44011fba_xl ) [ [ original post here ] ( http://anothercity.livejournal.com/1369800.html ) , with some more nice photos from moscow roofs ] with city in the background , for example ) . 
  just the whole city-planning of moscow is not so skyline-centric , so a lot of views are obstructed . 
  yeah , just the concept : dark above and beyond , light in the middle . 
  speak for yourself !, 
  and please , mind '' [ no true scotsman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_true_scotsman ) '' fallacy . 
  it 's not like a dozen of muscovites have the same opinion on each subject . 
  and i 'm definitely not even sure we can speak of a majority opinion here . 
  as for the other arguments , it is moscow now , i do n't think they 're going anywhere . 
  plus , with how many times moscow was ruined and rebuilt without any regard for stylistic/architectural coherence , it 's safe to say that `` moscowness '' of architecture is a very vague concept . 
  it reminds me of the latvian flag this way . 
  you need to squat better to see them !, 
  that 's why username benjamin-cat should always put you on guard on reddit , heh, 
  some say it 's even more reliable than words of a nigerian prince !, 
  on a more serious side , here 's [ reuters article ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-france-iduskbn19c2e7?il=0 ) on topic , if you 're interested, 
  just from r/europe , searching by term * slavery * : * https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5z08mz/raped_beaten_exploited_the_21stcentury_slavery/ * https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2stu28/i_was_sold_into_sexual_slavery_guardian_article/ * https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/64c227/saving_russias_brick_slaves_were_taking_them_home/ and many many more examples . 
  now ** that ** is modern day slavery . 
  not really far from its millenia-old meaning : complete loss of personal freedom and liberty while being physically , cruelly exploited .

  its pretty simple , eu wanted ukraine in its sphere of influence , they got them . 
  now if things would go smoothly and in a non-retarded way , there would be 2 parallel branches of power existing up until presidential elections on 25th of may . 
  the possibility of a pro-russian candidate victory is minimal , so ukraine will get someone like yatsenyuk/klichko ( with a probability of timoshenko giving support to one of them ) -  anti-russian president -  no deal , no better gas prices , increased economic pressure , no restructuring of loans and so on . 
  so ukraine will need money to simply not default until 25th of may and then depending on who won , they would need even more money . 
  if eu treaty would be signed , i believe commentators even here acknowledged that a lot of ukrainian industry would fall apart and closed down , so european union would need to fund educational programs as well ( if you destroy someones job , its a good idea to give them another one or skills to get a new one ) . 
  there are of course other problems like infrastructure etc , but its not critical . 
  i think the sooner you start educational programs with grants and whatnot , the better . 
  more time -  more opportunity to learn and not end up like greece or portugal . 
  all this ofc if russia would just sit there and watch , without trying to do anything funny . 
  so far i have n't really seen any serious russian involvement even though euromaidanpr twitter almost daily claims otherwise . 
  for 3 months the best they could do is to get some kind of ribbon , which is funny , caz today i 've read on lenta.ru an article where journalist in a conversation with `` activists '' saw hand-made press badges ( while they obviously were not ) . 
  i 'm not sure why u are being downvoted , i understood your message as that of a compassion and not judgement ( as of things to come ) . 
  basically i assumed it being just softhearted from your side : / we are living in the 21st century and people are still killing each other by thousands , caz they do n't like `` that other guy and what he believes in '' . 
  its just a fact . 
  declare state of emergency . 
  get army on the streets . 
  either arrest yanukovych and his family or let them flee ( dunno who would want them though , maybe some kind of stan or belarus if russia would ask really nicely ) . 
  announce early elections in like 1 month and give a lot of air time for politicians to promote themselves , especially independent ones . 
  all this should be done by high ranking military/intelligence officers and ** negotiate ** with either russia or imf or eu or us an immediate financial help package to avoid sovereign default . 
  basically pull of an egypt style coup to stabilize situation and get this situation defused . 
  that is if ukrainians want to keep their country as a whole and stop the violence . 
  in other case , ukraine will fall apart and level of hatred and violence will skyrocket . 
  also worth mentioning that the divide between pro-european western ukraine and pro-russian south-east would still exist and everything that comes with it . 
  unfortunately human history indicates that as a species we are not that good at negotiating or understanding the other side , we rather prefer `` submit to my point of view or fuck you '' style of approach . 
  in this very thread you suggest war with my country , give ideas about some kind of vunderwaffe and preach about democracy and everlasting peace after ww2 ( which is a whole lot of bullshit in itself ) . 
  not to mention remarks about women just waiting to be liberated by `` big nato dicks '' , waiting to get fucked . 
  reminds me of muslim preachers as well with all the virgins talk . 
  there have been plenty of interference from both european union and u.s. as of late , including officials visiting anti-government protest and giving them support . 
  just fucking imagine russian mps or iranian or chinese , preaching in the middle of washington . 
  this is ridiculous . 
  yet it happen in kiev . 
  well , in 2004 opposition came to power ( by whatever means ) and disappointed `` the people '' , so `` the people '' voted for other candidate , who as it turns out is just as disappointing . 
  if yanukovich is russia 's man , then why the fuck did he throw fuel into the fire with all the eu association talks , constant promises and so on ? 
  it seems like this idiot tried to sit on two chairs and as it is quite often happens , failed miserably . 
  you remind me of this fucking douchebag http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se32hateivw stop being a douche and get your head out of your ass you self-righteous moron . 
  edit , typo *, 
  i am not sure i understand guillotine clause correctly , basically if swiss refuse to vote the way eu wants , all previous treaties might be reworked ( which would fuck up economy as far as i understand ) ? 
  is this correct or am i missing something ? 
   the association agreement would not suddenly prevent trade , market opportunities and trade agreements between ukraine and russia to their mutual benefit . 
  not even a eu membership would do that : even if ukraine someday decided to apply for a eu membership there would be benefits and new opportunities for russia and russian businesses too . 
  it will not completely stop it , but i thought russia already made several hints how it will start to treat ukraine . 
  when you benefit from non-market based relations with someone , its not exactly wise to ignore that someone and do as you want . 
  if russia is holding a significant amount of power over ukraine and its financial stability , what makes you think that such power would not be exercised ? 
   it 's not a zero sum game . 
  but with the all or nothing approach your question seems to assume it is . 
  your model implies substantial economical growth , when afaik eurozone is in crisis and there is no light in the end of the tunnel . 
  demand in stagnant economies is finite , in shrinking it is lowering . 
  no one can buy shit when he has no money , i think it is obvious for everyone . 
  when you have no job , you do n't have any money . 
  what is worse is that demand was artificially boosted by reaganomics and debt issuing . 
  so unless you know a way to erase all the government and private debt accumulated over the last 20-30 years , there is no solution in the current system . 
  that is , if things remain the same and there would be no another global meltdown . 
  all i 'm saying is if russian officials ( putin oligarchs ) decide to restrict trade with ukraine to put them under pressure , they can do so and in that case europe would need to step up its game ( support ukrainian products ) . 
  but in doing so , they would have to replace european products with ukrainian . 
  if you buy `` freedom cheese '' , this means you do n't buy a normal dutch or french one , which in the long run , hurts their respective manufacturers . 
  this is why markets are so important , they keep jobs and cash inside the country . 
  i will not comment on imf , because for a russian this is an organization which `` advised '' shock therapy , privatization and all the other wonderful things that happen to my country during 90s . 
  i 'm not exactly objective here and have a hard time seeing any success stories from imf . 
  but as a westerner , i 'm sure you see the other picture . 
  regarding conditions of the loan , google gives this http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-31/ukraine-vows-to-curb-reserves-plunge-as-imf-repeats-loan-demands.html or ** even better ** this http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/10/31/ukraine-imf-idinl5n0il1ti20131031 sounds more like `` citizen , pay up '' , rather than `` comprehensive economical reforms to boost investment and whatnot '' . 
  also , does not address the fact that * european * demand for both steel and chemicals is not that high ( difficult to pay back to say the least ) . 
   the association agreement means even more trade than the existing trade agreements with the eu ( e.g. 
  the deep and comprehensive free trade area ( dcfta ) gives ukraine a free access to the eu 's over 500 million consumers and market with a combined economy of 12.9 trillion euros - while russia 's customs union has only 170 million consumers and a combined economy of 1.4 trillion euros . 
  giving access does not mean you can sell anything though , ukrainian products are not that competitive or in high demand , european on the other hand ... 
  there is one seriously competitive asset ukraine has , which is its farmland ( china kind a confirms my words ) . 
  again , demand for steel and chemicals is not that high in europe and whats more important that you need ** energy ** to produce both steel and chemicals . 
  guess who controls energy prices and who can make prices even less competitive ? 
  as a side note i am actually quite interested in ukraine success story , since i consider them as a somewhat more poor brother , so if they can do it , so can we . 
  i would like to hear what are they planning to do with all the oligarchs who control ~ 80 % of their economies though , i have not heard ** anything ** about them from euromaidan activists , but they seem to me as an `` elephant in the room '' . 
  yes , i understand what power and control means , but i 'm talking about next thing in line which is * consequences * . 
  in any given scenario in which europe is embracing ukraine , there is one * universal * outcome - such move would be seen by russia as ** extremely ** unfriendly . 
  hard to tell exactly what russia would do , but it would be quite unpleasant and eu-russia relations would be ruined for decades . 
  to clarify , 10 billion is this year only ( there would be plenty more to come ) to avoid default + you would need to compensate a loss of russian market for ukraine ( buy more ukrainian farm goods for ex , less european ) . 
  lets say klitchko ( or yatsenyuk ) has won and become a president and tyahnibok magically disappeared with his ultra-nationalist agenda . 
  as far as i remember their political platform initially was `` away from corrupt russia , embrace new hope in form of eu '' . 
  regardless how much i read various opinions of `` experts '' or just folks from livejournal and whatnot , there is a constant theme of `` bad russian influence '' . 
  so the question is - `` why would russia give ukraine any money , any debt relief , any market opportunities or any better deal on gas , if your political elite ( and it seems a huge portion of your population ) is openly anti-russian ? '', 
  and a follow-up question to fellow europeans - `` would you support giving ukraine a loan of at least 10 bln $ and buying more of their products ? 
  ( more agriculture stuff i guess ? 
  doubt anyone would buy machinery , when you have germany ), 
  do you have any proof of that or are you just pulling `` facts '' out of your ass ? 
  the reason im asking is because i 've seen plenty of cherry-picking footage with zero follow-ups , sort of like implanting information in people subconscious to manipulate them into your pov . 
  otherwise you are no better than any other asshole who screams left right and centre about zionists , cia and so on . 
  when this started i thought of this as an early electoral campaign to get some votes for opposition and interested parties , now its spiraling out of control into full scale revolution with capturing of local administrations and such . 
  i just hope ukraine wo n't turn out like sudan in the end . 
  be safe and try to sort things out in a non-violent way . 
  maaaybe bulgarians , but doubt so . 
  things like that do n't happen overnight , its been brewing for decades . 
  when soviet union collapsed , a lot of local politicians were like `` its all russia fault , we ourselves are awesome and will succeed 100 % ! '' . 
  or had somewhat similar train of thought . 
  20 + years has passed since and results are mixed . 
  some stans ( mostly with resources like kazakstan and turkmenistan ) are doing ok , some turned into a third world shithole with no future prospects . 
  there is also baltics who always were somewhat different , but its still funny to see pr attempts from tiny estonia to posture itself as an it-giant and cutting edge in innovation or poland 's `` invest in eastern poland '' commercials . 
  one would think that if things were great , there would be no need for such things , but i 'm no estonian or polish and overall they are definitely doing better than others ( or at least they look like they do ) . 
  and then there is ukraine . 
  i ca n't really describe whats wrong with it , but it feels like a girl who tries to live with 2 boyfriends and play them against each other for her own benefit . 
  she 's been `` dancing '' with both russia and eu for quite some time , taking monies from both sides and accepting gifts and whatnot . 
  main problem is , she is financially insolvent and unwilling to do anything about it . 
  recent russia-ukraine relations went sour after orange revolution in 2004 i think , when tymoshenko + yushenko came to power and started basically shitting on anything that have to do with russia , russian language , russian bases , schools , commemorating questionable ( from russian point of view ) `` heroes '' . 
  before all that , ukraine had a pretty good deal on energy , you can say even `` friendly '' .

  the general consensus is that the evil us and the eu control it, 
  and after this you expect me to write anything of value back at you lol, 
  i see no reason in writing anything of value to you because you do n't write anything of value either , you are just spitting out half truths and general narrative driven talking points . 
  about the book . 
  i really like novodvorskaya and i respect her but when it comes to history she 's on the same level of trust as nikolai starikov . 
  she 's no historian and she 's heavily biased . 
  i 've read a part of this book but did n't complete it . 
  and galleon is n't my friend . 
  he 's a very silly vatnik who constantly talking shit in all threads regarding russia and ukraine . 
  just like you do . 
   russian educational system that has already explained you why it was neccessary and right thing to do to collaborate with golden horde damn , i must have missed this part during the history course !, 
  the more you keep saying false and narrative-driven talking points , the more it 's obvious how little you know about moscow duchy . 
  they are slav traitors russia best slav orthodox and holy !!, 
  that 's quite a good shitstorm you have here , guys, 
  lol, 
  i thought i 'd share this well-made video from the arzamas projekt . 
  the original russian version got popular and gathered around 800.000 views . 
  there is also the [ `` ancient rome in 20 minutes '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46zxl-v4qwy ) video . 
  it 's worth watching . 
  it looks so modest, 
  worst day of my life, 
   the relationship of nato and russia deteriorated recently due to russia 's annexation of crimea well that 's just not true . 
  there were big scandals since the 90s . 
  okay , that was a good one . 
  you earned your upvote, 
  damn son , what a snappy comment , you owned me :( (, 
  i 'm going to shock you but the history of the mongol empire ( of which the golden horde was just a part ) is taught pretty well . 
  it depends on the region though . 
  a lot of regions have their own local history courses in addition to the general history course . 
  that 's pretty simple . 
  kiev was the capital of the predecessor state of modern russia , ukraine and belarus , hence the story of kiev is taught at schools, 
  because people generally remember only the biggest duchess which were on the territory of modern russia ( moscow , novgorod , vladimir , maybe ryazan ) . 
  galicia is taught of course but moscow is the biggest focus obviously , hence all the confusion i believe, 
  well you 're saying that rf is parasitizing on other 's history . 
  whose history is it then ? 
  yep . 
  it 's always funny to see how idiotic russian or ukrainian nationalists are trying to claim a 1000 years old state exclusive for themselves, 
  lol . 
  please try to explain rationally how rus ' history is exclusively ukrainian ( you ca n't ), 
  [ it 's so ... beautiful ] ( https://i.imgur.com/fnhphms.gifv ), 
  i really like our list of mandatory literature in school . 
  it really has everything : from dante to gulag archipelago . 
  if only i was n't so lazy during my school days and actually read at least most of these books so i would n't have to catch up with all of these later . 
  i doubt it , but still i think this news should stay based on the following remark in the `` local crime '' rule : `` however , we reserve the right to approve funny , interesting and/or unique crime stories '' . 
  it 's local but it 's an interesting case , imo, 
  he also wants to kill all caucasians , he is paid by the cia and the fsb simulationsly and he stole every single centimeter of forest in kirov !, 
  are you talking about the word `` siloviki '' ? 
  if so , then it 's a widely spread term for one the kremlin 's clans , there 's no error in that . 
  according to the fbk investigation , restaurateur prigozhin stole approximately 8 billion rubles on contracts with the ministry of defence . 
  navalny asserts that fbk managed to documentary proof the cartel agreement between the structures of an official and the ministry to the value of 23 billion rubles . 
  businessman yevgeny prigozhin monopolized the market for servicing military towns in russia through a group of companies controlled by him and received 23 tenders of the russian ministry of defence for a total of over 23.5 billion rubles , according to an investigation by the navalny 's anti-corruption foundation ( fbk ) . 
  in total , according to fbk , 180 billion rubles have passed through the cartel . 
  the politician asserts that `` putin 's cook '' prigozhin `` having agreed with the officials of the ministry of defense , stole the money of the defense orders '' . 
  `` in total , more than 23 billion rubles were disbursed , at least one third of which , according to our estimates , was stolen '' navalny said on his website . 
  he called the prigozhin cartel the largest in the russian history , pointing out that before that the largest case , considered by the federal antimonopoly service , concerned 3.5 billion rubles . 
  according to the investigation , a number of prigozhin 's companies have branches and offices in an off-limits areas - military bases of the ministry of defense . 
  fbk also claims that the russian ministry of defense allowed prigozhin 's companies to work without a valid access to state secrets , although it was necessary under the work conditions . 
  it is also noted that the monopolization of the market for servicing military towns became possible due to the intentional consolidation of lots ( state contracts ) at the ministry 's auctions , the connection between the structures of the ministry of defense and prigozhin 's companies was established under loan agreements , which they entered into with each other after the signing of state contracts . 
  `` facts indicate that the ministry of defense simply gave contracts to prigozhin 's companies directly , by participating with them in the collusion , '' the publication notes . 
  lawyer of the fbk , lyubov sobol , reported in january 2016 that fbk filed an application to the federal antimonopoly service about a possible collusion from the companies affiliated with prigozhin . 
  in august , fbk appealed to the fsb with a request to initiate criminal proceedings against prigozhin . 
  as navalny notes , the fas decision on the cartel of prigozhin will be announced on may 22 . 
  `` there is a possibility that the fas will become frightened and will greatly soften the decision , will exempt the main prigozhin 's companies from a fine or something like that '' the politician suggested . 
  yevgeny prigozhin is the head of the `` concord management and consulting '' . 
  this is the managing company of the restaurant holding `` concord '' from st. petersburg . 
  the company owns several restaurants and a chain of boutiques `` the museum of chocolate '' . 
  `` concord management and consulting '' acted as the organizer of a series of celebrations for high-ranking russian officials , including on the occasion of the inauguration of russian president vladimir putin in 2012 . 
  according to the investigation of rbk , prigozhin is financing a `` troll factory '' - the largest media holding in russia with a monthly audience of 36 million people . 
  at the end of 2016 , the us introduced a restaurateur to the sanctions list . 
  it has everything to do with the text . 
  there are dozens of these kind of images on the internet but only this one with this particular text was banned . 
  and do you really think that it was banned by some federal court because it pissed off putin so much ? 
  it was banned 1,5 years ago by some local court in some unknown town . 
  this image was just added to the federal registry a few months ago , hence all the fuss . 
  it is n't though . 
  banned image has an inscription which says : `` putin voters are like faggots , there 're many of them around , but none among my friends '' , which is why , i believe , the picture was banned . 
  fight me, 
   the russians invaded and occupied crimean under catherine the great . 
  their only claim to the land is based off imperialism . 
  well yes , so what ? 
  crimean tatars were pillaging moscow for decades and even burned down it one time and crimea was a big slave port because of all the russians they abducted . 
  that 's why it 's silly . 
  everyone were doing horrible stuff back in these glorious days . 
  russia conquered crimea out of imperialism , crimean tatars were selling russian slaves to turkey . 
  these things does n't matter , it was 300 years ago . 
  well , yes , i agree , but you speak as if all of the crimean tatars were fighting against the soviets . 
  this was n't the case , which makes the deportation of all crimean tatars even more terrible, 
   why were they under the occupation of the kremlin because the reds won the civil war  as well as occupation for the 150 years prior soviet union did n't occupied them 150 years prior , russian empire did . 
  it 's very silly to bring up the stuff which happened before the civil war as if crimean tatars were some saint people fighting against the evil russian conquerors . 
  crimea was conquered in 1783 . 
  i 'm not sure that there was stalinism around those times, 
  his brother and also an actor yuri kuliy was sentenced today, 
  yes , because some of them of them sided with the nazis , they all should be killed . 
  by your logic all russians should be killed as well , because of the russian liberation army . 
  i guess he was also very merciful to the chechens and the ingush because he did n't kill them all too !, 
  late stage capitalism memes are the best memes, 
  it 's a shame that there were no `` no step on snek '' flags . 
  they would look great in a context of this protest, 
  but ukraine is n't a cause either . 
  yeah , only one person was detained as far as i know .

   the west is not the same thing as nato , mind you define your understanding of the west , then . 
  would you care to elaborate ? 
  we 're on a collision course right now , but i 'm fairly sure we still identify as ourselves . 
  for a country that 's currently basing its identity on opposition , look a little bit to the southwest of our borders . 
  swedish news : `` the russians are seeking to overtake belgium militarily . 
  they tried the same here with marines loaded onto invisible submarines , but we warded them off with gay signs on buoys and a feminist foreign policy . 
  take notes ! '', 
  finnish radio : `` russia 's existence is a threat by itself . '', 
  baltic politicians : `` the bombings served to create chaos in which putin 's sleeper cells inside belgium would awake and bring the country under a communist rule . '', 
  ukranian officials : wait , they 're not even in eu . 
  turkish pm : `` the bombings were carried out by russian long-range stealth bombers . '', 
  french , british , and german news agencies ( together ) : `` the uproar we see today was intended to give boost to the far-right parties in belgium , which putin can fund and control later on . '', 
  all : `` putin is an autistic sociopath indulging in pedophilia . 
  such fiend is most likely to order an atrocity like yesterday . '', 
  do you mean something like the above ? 
  same place where your desire for serious conversation is . 
  i 'm not about to take an accusation of bullshit from someone who immediately dismisses events he forgot about as made up . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/siberia_airlines_flight_1812 ignorance , you say . 
  oh , you by no means have to do a single thing , love , but i was under the impression that you came here for discussion . 
  discussion usually implies being familiar with the subject at hand . 
  see , this is the exact kind of reaction i 'm talking about . 
  i like the following part the most :  dude , are you out of your mind ? 
  what 're you talking about ? 
  google is an easy tool to use , and `` sbi1812 '' is not a search term that 's likely to bring you irrelevant results . 
  read up , then we can talk . 
  the only solution i can recommend is to grow a thicker skin . 
  he 's not stopping anytime soon , since there are some people of voting age around who think the same things he says , but seriously . 
  do you feel the same way about stand-up comedians as well ? 
  there is a difference between a parliamentary and a jester . 
  he is our jester . 
  sometimes a brawler , too , but he 's more entertaining as a jester . 
   i think the silent majority feel just like you said - they do n't really care . 
  does n't that sum his behavior up ? 
  he was more vocal about not caring , sure , but silencing him is hardly going to change the fact that millions have read the same news article , thought the same thing , and then condemned him for having such an awful opinion . 
  you 're pretty much the first who admitted that you care about as much as he does in this thread , right ? 
  this was all i was asking for , some honesty . 
  what else do you propose , ignore everything and just blindly believe that someone out there hopefully cares ? 
  this is n't kindergarden anymore . 
  do you think people over here care ? 
  do you believe swearing he 's an exception will fix it ? 
  are you convinced that many on this subreddit or around europe , hell , around the whole western world care about dead russians ? 
  let 's review some instances of that explicit european solidarity with the russian people preceded by european reaction in similar circumstances , but when the victims lived closer to home . 
  from around day 1 , there was a global sentiment that the russians did it , that this crime would not go unpunished , that innocent lives were sacrificed to feed hitl - err , stal - err , putin , yes , putin 's bloodlust . 
  everyone and their grandmother expressed their sorrows on the social and regular media and wherever else not . 
  yeah , i believe russia got some official apologies . 
  ha , the man who was ousted in 2004 ( 2003 ? ), 
  under the excuse of being a `` russian puppet '' outright stated that worse things happen , get over it lads . 
  ukraine has still not admitted responsibility . 
  was there any substantial reprehension of such behavior ? 
  israel made a statement , i guess . 
  a couple of chechens bombs a marathon in boston , killing three . 
  the news go nuts . 
  the russians bleed for something like a decade trying to put down a major revolt . 
  the news brand them as barbaric tyrants oppressing the glorious freedom fighters . 
  an organized terrorist cell delivers a number of acts of terror to paris in a single night . 
  130 dead . 
  we all remember the atmosphere clear enough to warrant no explanation , i hope . 
  nord-ost , 130 to 174 dead ; beslan , 330 dead in a bloody school ; several apartment buildings straight up demolished . 
  what was the reaction ? 
  oh , let me refresh those memories : `` you guys killed your own ! '', 
  this is how much the europeans care . 
  you can deny it , sure , but a tiny number of people will feel like your promises that this latvian does not represent the silent majority are worth as much as his apology . 
  inappropriate my ass , it was 146 % appropriate from his point of view . 
  look , i 'm just a bitter russian tired of getting lied in the face . 
  i do n't ask much , just for people to be honest instead of politically correct . 
  you 'll have to do better than that , a professional clown with an electorate of people creatively flipping the bird to every other candidate is n't much of a carreer . 
  oh , i guess they do n't show his calm interviews over there in lithuania since it 'd damage an otherwise perfect image of a russian aggressor . 
  and then the outsiders worry about the evil xenophobic russians . 
  how dare they persecute someone they accuse of criminal conspiracy against their own people . 
  call your congressmen and demand to bomb moscow right now . 
  for 17 years and counting . 
  that is true . 
  our world is just beginning . 
  hell , i 'd prefer the outside world to know anything about the meaning of the word ` nineties ' over in russia . 
  too few people know what it stands for . 
  well , there 's al-qaeda . 
  power play ? 
  lewd !, 
  operation snow storm soon ? 
  the question is not whether it 's wrong or not , it 's about title editorialization . 
  the rule was made for a reason . 
  well , as long as they were n't flying above them and opening the hatches , it 's not that bad , eh ? 
  maybe one day people on the other side of the barricades will understand there 's much less of a difference than they think . 
  that 's called ignoring the market . 
  because even in democratic countries , the government 's line of thinking is that people should see only what they need or want to see . 
  transparency is not the step on which our budget bleeds money . 
  it happens a bit later , when the powers that be use their own plans for ass-wiping . 
  they 're not nearly as effective at it as specialized platforms though , and likely several times more expensive . 
  i doubt getting a point or even a topol to kola would be a problem . 
  should they magically transform into awacs , strategic bombers , ballistic missiles or other high-value military equipment , yes . 
  s-x00s are an overkill for hornets , they exist mainly to neutralize nastier potential and real threats . 
  thanks , never thought that `` french anti-extremism caesar '' could be a real job . 
   anti-extremism tsar what, 
  it 's more than a right , it 's an obligation which requires its subjects to die if necessary . 
  i see a problem with making more people die . 
  equality over self-preservation ? 
  that 's one hell of a dumb wish , and i say this having served my time . 
  because people already pay a high enough price for national ambitions . 
  might as well spare the fairest part of humanity a fate like that . 
  for what reason ?

  in ukraine , there is nothing like this . 
  ** we have seen repeatedly how the elderly who moved to their children from russia ( where they had status and benefits ) to ukraine , lost all rights . 
  this is direct discrimination . 
  there were many attempts in which we also participated , to compel the parliament to pass such laws , there were more than a dozen bills , and one of them even passed the first reading in 2010 . 
  but this all stalled . 
  the law on the rehabilitation of victims of political repression in ukraine since 1991 has not changed at all . 
  this category of people - the children of the repressed , as well as their widows or widowers - are not at all covered by law . 
  in fact ukraine just did n't give a fuck about the crimean tatars when crimea was a part of ukraine . 
  they started to use the crimean tatar card for political gains after 2014 . 
  yes , the deportation of the crimean tatars is officially recognized as a crime . 
  the victims ( including people were born after the deportation ) receive benefits and privileges , e.g. 
  they pay 50 % for utilities , drugs , can use public transportation for free . 
  they did n't get shit in ukraine . 
  there were large official ceremonies commemorating the deportation today : * ceremonies in bakhchysarai with top crimean leadership : http://crimea.ria.ru/society/20170518/1110423871.html ( i know people here dislike ria , but it contains photos ) * [ armyansk ] ( http://1tvcrimea.ru/pages/news/063982-v-armjanske-vspominajut-zhertv-deportacii ) * [ students in simferopol ] ( http://1tvcrimea.ru/pages/news/063983-bolee-2000-studentov-vozlozhili-cvety-k-monumentu-v-krymskom-inzhenerno-pedagog ) i do n't why the person on the pic was detained , but he was n't arrested , he was detained for a few hours ( or probably even less -- maybe even not detained at all ) . 
  well , it 's not hard to me to apologize to poland right here for atrocities during soviet-polish war , repressions against ethnic poles during the great terror in 1937-1938 , for 1939 ( lwow is the rightful polish clay ) , katyn , warsaw 1944 , and soviet occupation . 
  i know very well that russia was n't always a good guy , a victim or a liberator , it was a perpetrator as well . 
  katyn is officially recognized by russia as a stalin 's crime , it 's in school textbooks . 
  but these regular five minutes of hate against russians , these regular comparisons with the nazis in this sub are still pathetic . 
  without us , orcs of mordor , in a likely course of event the poles would just cease to exist . 
  unlike the nazis the soviet union never planned to exterminate the poles and it never considered the poles as some kind of second sort people . 
  stalin killed a lot of poles , but he killed a lot of ethnic russians as well , often extremely random people like astronomers from the pulkovo observatory . 
  i agree . 
  ukraine unfairly occupied the western ukraine . 
  you should fix that terrible historical error . 
  yeah , we all see how _ you _ decided to stop that shit with kosovo . 
   now that the shoe is on the other foot , are you going to support that as a universal precept ? 
  that would be a perfect solution . 
  i do n't care about chechnya , if they would contain themselves inside of their borders . 
  russia accepted the chechen sovereignty in 1996 , [ the peace treaty was signed ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%94%d0%be%d0%b3%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%be%d1%80_%d0%be_%d0%bc%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%b5_%d0%b8_%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b8%d0%bd%d1%86%d0%b8%d0%bf%d0%b0%d1%85_%d0%b2%d0%b7%d0%b0%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%be%d0%be%d1%82%d0%bd%d0%be%d1%88%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%b9_%d0%bc%d0%b5%d0%b6%d0%b4%d1%83_%d0%a0%d0%a4_%d0%b8_%d0%a7%d0%a0%d0%98 ) . 
  but then maskhadov 's government collapsed , and salafi islamists basaev , khattab & co. started to build their caucasus emirate , invaded dagestan , blew up shit in russia . 
  at this point it did n't matter if they were a separate country or just a part of russia , it was just self-defense . 
  afghanistan was n't part of the us , but the us went there after 9/11 . 
   what happens if some portion of your country -- especially , say , a town on a river , something that cuts off access to upstream russia did n't cut access to anything , it did n't poison the ukrainian well , it did n't destroy some ecosystem . 
  it was ukraine who blocked electricity , water and goods for crimea . 
  what did the ukrainians lose exactly from the `` annexation '' ? 
  they are still free to travel to crimea visa-free like always . 
  the main ukrainian port is in odessa , not crimea . 
  just some borders were moved on the map . 
  the only thing ukraine really lost were 2 millions of people who voted for yanukovich and did n't care about ukraine and hated its european projects . 
  crimea is not just a town ( some go further and compare it with one house or flat wanting independence ) . 
  crimea in independent ukraine was an autonomous republic with almost 2m population , it 's larger than some eu countries . 
  they had their own constitution and certain autonomy , an autonomous republic was just one level lower than a soviet socialist republic in the ussr . 
   i do n't think that russia , as a country , would support that . 
  their _ support _ does n't matter . 
  they need to be realistic and _ accept _ that . 
  it 's not going to change anyway . 
  and start to act pragmatically without doing stupid emotional tricks like suddenly cutting electricity to crimea -- it 's not doing anything good to anyone . 
   we do n't know what crimeans we know what they want very well , because there were tons of polls , including polls by western pollsters like gfk and gallup , all of them show ~ 90 % of support of reunification with russia . 
  it does n't mean that 10 % wants to get back to ukraine , most of the rest just do n't care . 
  it was n't similar to brexit or trump 's election when few percents decided the winner . 
  with this overwhelming support of russia , small details just do n't matter , any fair referendum would bring the same result . 
  btw , one of the polls was ordered by taras beresovets ( pro-poroshenko ukrainian political `` consultant '' ) , and he did n't get the results he wanted . 
  check his interview with rf/erl : https://ru.krymr.com/a/27129465.html -- of course , it 's full of bs , but even according to him 82 % of crimeans supported joining russia . 
   even if you claim there was no real/intentional intimidation , just seeing those soldiers there when you vote is an intimidation . 
  2014 presidential and parliamentary elections in donbass were not legal then . 
  also , they had ridiculously low turnout , unlike turnout of _ at least _ 75 % of `` intimidated '' people in the crimean referendum . 
  and this intimidation -- it 's just an excuse to not recognize crimean 's will . 
  they are intimidated , had to vote under barrel of gun . 
  they are zombies , tv told them to vote , they voted . 
  they are brainwashed by putin 's propaganda . 
  they are rats , who betrayed ukraine . 
  the referendum is null and void , because both answers were the same . 
  no , they just do n't want to live in ukraine . 
  there is not a single rational reason , why the crimeans would prefer ukraine over russia . 
   why was there not a protest movement after 1954 up to the dissilution of ussr to make crimea russian ? 
  there were protests against it . 
  see the crimean referendum of 1990 , the [ declaration of state sovereignty of 1992 ] ( http://zakon3.rada.gov.ua/krym/show/rb001d002-91?test=4/umfpegznhhi8p.zinijbx/hi4ias80msh8ie6 ) and the [ crimean referendum of 1994 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_referendum,_1994 ) for greater sovereignty ( supported by 78 % ) . 
  ukraine in response just scrapped the crimean constitution and deposed the crimean president . 
   russians outside of russia proper had no concept that they were in a different country when living in the baltics or ukraine until 1991 . 
  i agree . 
  these issues had to be resolved during the dissolution of the ussr -- majority russian crimea should have never been a part of independent ukraine , or mostly armenian nagorny karabakh should not be a part of azerbaijan . 
  sadly , with the alcoholic in the seat of the leader it was the mission impossible . 
  luckily , the problem with crimea was fixed 23 years later . 
   there were foreign troops on ukrainian soil who stole the land . 
  without these foreign troops , the referendum would be forcefully suppressed by ukraine . 
  do n't forget that the referendum was declared by legitimate at that moment ukrainian authorities of the autonomous republic of crimea . 
   german of the sudetenland also applauded the anshluss . 
  i do n't think the annexation of sudetenland was entirely wrong . 
  things that _ followed _ the annexation were entirely wrong . 
  sudetenland had like 90 % of germans , it was a recipe for disaster that eventually really happened . 
  stage 1 . 
  denial . 
  i even cited the sources used for the map -- similarweb and alexa . 
  * http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/ee * https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/estonia, 
  savik shuster 's show in russia was closed in 2004 for some phony reasons . 
  savik shuster 's show in ukraine was closed in 2016 for some phony reasons . 
  so some parallels are obvious . 
  but full russian model in ukraine is unlikely , because poroshenko has no power of putin . 
  some lighter model -- maybe . 
  i 'm not sure that oligarch-owned media ( russia of 1990s and modern ukraine ) is much better for a country , however . 
  it 's both . 
  article 1 of the russian constitution :  the russian federation - russia is a democratic federal law-bound state with a republican form of government . 
   the names `` russian federation '' and `` russia '' shall be equal . 
  it 's up to the crimeans to select their way , not to a bunch of ukrainian nationalists in kiev . 
  if crimea ever was stolen , it was stolen from russia in 1954 by khruschev who ignored opinion of the crimeans . 
  the thing that happened in 2014 is called `` self-determination '' . 
  crimeans ca n't steal from themselves . 
  could you finally realize that the crimeans just do n't want to live in ukraine and never wanted to live there ? 
  and why should they ? 
  at this point ukraine is worse than russia in every thinkable way .

  to answer your question , no , those people live in their own version of reality . 
  eh , bittorrent ? 
  your point being ? . . 
  the sources are everywhere . 
  estonian white book , for instance . 
  yet death rate amongst the deported was about 7 % . 
  that 's bad , but that 's not `` extermination level '' bad , nowhere near . 
  and why should russian army `` defend '' gagauz or bulgarians ? 
   every person who want 's to live in russia  journalists have organized the movement `` people 's rada of bessarabia . '', 
  it had as its objective the protection of interests of national minorities in odessa region bro , do you even read ? 
   gulag was certainly a death sentence . 
  first , no , it was n't ( it was quite close to it , but many people survived ) . 
  second , deported people were not sent to gulag . 
  third , nowhere near the 50 % of the baltics ' population was deported . 
  er , what now ? 
  we ( or rather , the soviets ) never exterminated that much . 
  ussr was formed by russian , belorussian and ukrainian soviet republics , if i remember it correctly . 
  those three nations agreed to dissolve it in the ninetees , too . 
  ( \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0436\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f , ca n't translate it right now on the mobile ) . 
   no i 'd rather we escalate our sanctions against russia , thanks very much . 
  too bad you do n't have any say in that matter . 
  you need more bold . 
  caps too . 
  on a more serious note , a britain guy accusing a russian of some crimes against humanity ? 
  that 's rich . 
  we did wrong upon chechnya . 
  we also amended that , to the extent it was possible . 
  move along , that 's none of your business . 
  worry about millions of indians who died because of your rule . 
  did you also watch how we poured billions of rubles there and rebuilt it completely , even better that it was ? 
  nobody 's perfect , you know . 
  no , i 'm dismissing it because it is simply not a source . 
  the claim is pulled out of thin air : `` in a country that lost more people defeating the nazis than any other country , there are now an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 neo-nazis , half of the world 's total . '' estimated by whom , and how exactly ? 
  there is no information on that , there is no link to the actual research , there is nothing . 
   they are also in russia , which is home to more than half the world 's neo-nazis . 
  ... as one lonely newspaper tells us , citing an unnamed `` research '' . 
  sure . 
   there was a vote of 96.77 % to join the russian federation . 
  dude , in a democratic system like voting , use common sense either falklands islands referendum was fixed too , or your argument about impossibility of such high percentage in `` a democratic system like voting '' is invalid . 
  you choose . 
   the referedum was illegal in the first place under what law , exactly ? 
  please cite . 
   the mayor of the crimean capital even said there were gangs going around stealing passports from people who voted for ukraine . 
  too bad no factual proof was provided . 
  literally `` he said , she said '' . 
  that 's not a very strong argument . 
  well , at least you 're not lying anymore about `` intimidation '' and `` international observers '' that `` were not allowed to enter '' , that 's a progress . 
  eh , google it up , dude . 
  as far as i can remember , there were some ( far ) right mps from some european countries , nothing major . 
  nobody wanted to ruin their reputation , something like that . 
  anyhow , the referendum was open to anybody who desired to observe it . 
  as for its recognition and related problems , it really says volumes about how western world treats democracy . 
  it 's not about what people want , it 's about what they are allowed to want . 
  point in case : earlier crimean referendums , where the mainland ukraine basically said `` u want more autonomy ? 
  fcuk you then '' . 
  somehow nobody cried about how ukraine forced its will onto crimea in the ninetees . 
  except we do n't . 
  current decline is nowhere near the crisis of 2008 , let alone the nineties . 
  here are some examples : * [ inflation rate ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=rucpiyoy&amp;v=201606141716n&amp;d1=19160101&amp;d2=20161231&amp;h=300&amp;w=600 ) * [ gdp per capita ppp ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=rusnygdppcapppcd&amp;v=201606141716n&amp;d1=19160101&amp;d2=20161231&amp;h=300&amp;w=600 ), 
   i 'm still in awe , how putin and his gangsters have so much support among russians . 
  that 's because you know jack shit about life in russia . 
  during putin 's rule , russians experienced massive economic growth , especially visible because it came right after the catastrophe which were the 90s . 
   what international observers were there ? 
  there was an absence of un and osce observers . 
  because they refused to go there , not because they were n't allowed to . 
   no serious country even recognizes the referedum . 
  so what ? 
  that 's their political stance , nothing more . 
   where there was widespread intimidation false . 
  contrary to what people say about `` russian soldiers observing the vote process '' or something like that , nobody managed to produce actual evidence of that . 
   no international observors were allowed in crimea during the voting false . 
  there were international observers ; probably not the kind you 'd like to see , but that 's your problem : no international observers were prohibited from , ah , observing . 
   do you really think russia would of let crimea rejoin ukraine after they put military troops there and already dissolved parliament ? 
  actually , i do . 
  both options were acceptable for russian government : old crimean constitution gave it enough autonomy to keep business with russia ( like , you know , allowing that military base ) even if mainland ukraine was against it . 
  on a side note :  would of how about not hiding behind other country 's flair ? 
  this kind of error is very typical for ( not very well educated ) native english speakers who first learn to talk and only then learn to write . 
   russia not russia . 
  that 's modern russia , ukraine , belarus and about ten other less influential countries combined . 
  a day after parts of russian empire are returned , i 'd guess . 
   some of us have n't forgotten the videos of armed russian soldiers watching on as the crimeans cast their easily visible giant-checkbox votes , depositing them in transparant boxes . 
  please provide * one * such video . 
   independent dagestan dagestan never wanted independence . 
   chechnya happened in 2003 . 
  you were probably too young to notice , though . 
   and in 1917 tsar russia actually signed finnish independence too bad you do n't even know your own history ( assuming the flair is true ) . 
   96.77 % , really ? 
  are you saying that [ falkland islands referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falkland_islands_sovereignty_referendum,_2013 ) was fixed too ? 
   restore crimea to the 1992 consitution powers , which both de facto mean crimea is an ` independent state ' wrong . 
  the second option explicitly stated that crimea remains `` a part of ukraine '' . 
  too bad your joke is 20 years old . 
  congrats on the successful thawing , though . 
  you first . 
  said who ? 
  eh no , you 're not . 
  you 're so close culturally that people from the states , for instance , see no difference at all . 
  the problem with your argument is that while / r/europe goes ape-shit crazy about relatively minor violations of the free speech in russia , people get actually killed for their sexual identification in some other countries , and it goes almost completely under the radar . 
  those `` some other countries '' , by the way , are kind of allies of your own country , directly or not ( hey , usa ! ) . 
  do n't you think that criticism should be pointed at what requires most immediate attention ? 
   it 's like saying that there exist a distinct way for russia ( i.e.

   he did n't say anything to media , `` anonymous friend '' did . 
  oh , i did n't notice that in the article . 
  but this makes the story even more suspicious . 
   the article mentioned he asked for help from committee for torture prevention , they could show him photos for identification of previously known torturers serving locally . 
  okay , but the article says that it was in march 21 , i.e. 
  today , and the article was published at 11:01 . 
  i do n't know , but ot seem were strange too : let 's imagine the committee start to work at 7:00 , how many time it would get to identify these people and than phone call your friend and tell him all the details including surnames of the agents , and then for the friend to call to media-zone and tell them whole story in details ? 
  also is it the site site of this committee ? 
  http://pytkam.net/o-komitete.obschaya-infomacia if so , then i find strange he came to them , because they focus on nizhniy novgorod and some other regions . 
  but yes , they claim to have an office in moscow with 2 people in it - would it be enough to collect images of all fsb agents ? 
  i doubt . 
   people are quite careless on social media , even if they work in fsb . 
  just search for your local ( police ) district , look at the faces . 
  fsb does n't have local district sites with faces of agents . 
   and forced to write a note that he is willing to work for fsb as an informant . 
  he identified one fsb officer and an anti-extremism police officer among the torturers really ? 
  not that i want to play devil 's advocate , but these details seem made up . 
  why would they force him to became fsb informant ? 
  how was he able to identify officers ? 
  did he know them before or what ? 
  something is not clear in this story , and there 're also no confirmations apart from articles on russian opposition sites ( which is not good source of information ) . 
  i do n't understand why would this student write about it to media , but do n't write anything in his social media and make a couple of photos of himself . 
  you ca n't be serious . 
  these eyewitnesses were n't even collected by officials , lmao just admit that you tried to made shit up . 
  why are you talking about officials when i said eyewitnesses ? 
  is blaming everything on the russians also the national character of estonians ? 
  yeah it 's interesting that there 're thousands eyewitnesses of massacres committed by nazis in belarus , and not a single one eyewitness of massacres by rkka or nkvd . 
   russians probably did n't use bombs , did n't shell anything , did n't even shoot or destroy infrastructure , needed for survival , while they retreated . 
  such a good guys these russians are . 
  first of all , rkka and soviet union were not russian , in fact ( i think well known to you ) , russians made only about 60 % of soviet population in 1939 , so it 's unfair to attribute soviet achievements only to russians . 
  second , most of civilians in belarus died because of nazi atrocities , and not because of combat in civilian areas . 
  yeah , nazis were so kind and mercy to oppressed by bolsheviks belorussians , that they killed around 30 % of belorussians, 
   by claiming that irreligious people are irrational or that life for them is irrational ... that 's not exactly that i said . 
  what i try to argue is that * all * people are irrational , religious or not . 
   why should i care ? 
  well , that 's perfectly fine irrational position - nothing to be ashamed of . 
  [ moscow is not as flat as you may think . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wb4ehuw.jpg ) add trees and buildings to the picture , moscow was surrounded by forest back in 1940s, 
  maybe he was metaphorical, 
  [ it 's false . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_moscow )  on 2 december a reconnaissance battalion came to the town of khimki -- some 18 km ( 11 mi ) away from the kremlin in central moscow reaching its bridge over the moscow-volga canal as well as its railway station . 
  this marked the farthest advance of german forces on moscow . 
  lmao germans never entered the city , and were able to see kremlin only from aircraft . 
   your religiously indoctrinated mindset how is my mindset `` religiously indoctrinated '' ? 
   other people see a reason to live by default . 
  i do n't , and so were and are many others . 
   all creatures live . 
  that 's the whole point of life . 
  yet god is an invention . 
  no no no , what 's the * rational * point of life ? 
  because living because you can is irrational . 
  it does n't follows from any logically correct reasoning . 
   next you 'll say religion is pointless and prove my point ... 
  i never said religion has any point , nor claimed opposite . 
   i do n't think you understand what those words mean . 
  then tell me what you do imply by `` rational '' . 
  haha , i actually asked my question to detect people like you , to detect ignorant people who even refuse to discourse and think about the problem . 
  if anything , you 're much closer to classical religious mindset than i , because you just state dogmas and throw insults on those who do n't follow them . 
  but your point is n't * rational * . 
  your statements are just like axioms with no arguments to support them . 
  like :  because life on earth is the only chance we get for living how do you know ? 
  what if some kind of reincarnation exists ? 
  it 's not rational to assume it . 
   so better spend ... again , it 's just your personal irrational preference . 
   if life has no meaning , the meaning is what you give it . 
  but this means that our lifes are irrational . 
  but your will to live is irrational , because there 's no point of life . 
  your will is as irrational as a will of a religious person to believe in god . 
  your family feelings do n't matter too , because their lives are as pointless as your life . 
  arguing with religious people does n't help too , because this argue is pointless too and therefore irrational . 
  so , by even not committing suicide , you make yourself irrational . 
  if you 're so rational , what do you think is the reason not to commit a suicide ? 
  because you know , we all are just tiny bits of matter in the infinite universe , so all our lives are pointless . 
  there 's no reason to to live , at least by committing a suicide , we will explore something new , we will know first handed what happens with our minds when we die . 
  ayn rand counted as russian really cringed me, 
  he also forgot like half of europe, 
  good genes , very good genes , ok , very smart, 
  i do n't know any eastern european country beside poland that banned abortions, 
  more ukrainians fought in the red army against hitler than collaborated with him, 
  i like how cases from your links got zero evidences of russia involved . 
  so basically swedish line : shit happened , we suspect russia , no proofs , but let 's blame russia anyway . 
  we are too lazy to add eyes ), 
  ussr was an experiment too ... 
   latvia continued to exist legally not more legally than yanukovich is legal president of ukraine . 
   no they were n't . 
  tovarish in denial, 
  compensations and repression museums are on paper now ? 
   soviets invaded again when nazis lost the war stop this bs plz . 
  latvian did not existed under nazi occupation , ussr invaded occupied by nazi territory , not latvia . 
  or should they just left this territory occupied ? 
  nobody pretends everything is fine . 
  compensations for victims are paid . 
  names of nkvd agents has nothing to do with rehabilitation . 
  admitting = !, 
  reparations . 
   are you saying that russians admit :  causing artificial famine in ukraine with millions deaths . 
  how is it described in russian school books ? 
   signing molotov-ribbentrop pact and occupation of poland . 
  what do russian pupils study on history lessons about this ? 
   occupation of estonia , latvia and lithuania , mass deportations there .

  obviously ussr did n't to it to help poland , i 'm not saying you should be thankful to the ussr for that , fuck stalin , he deserves to rot . 
  even if he did some good , there is no need to thank him . 
  but it is wise to be mindful of what could have happen and what did not happen and why . 
  like i clarified , i meant liberating from nazis , not stealing from romania . 
  i know , i know , but ask my grandparents and they have a very different opinion . 
  and i meant , ' * liberate from the nazis * ' . 
  not the part where ussr stole bessarabia from romania . 
  they say that when romania ruled their land , times were shit . 
  schools were reserved for the rich , the rich did whatever they pleased , they killed the village boys in brawls and raped the village girls . 
  people lived in mud , shit and straw huts ( made from cow dung , river clay and straw from the fields ) . 
  people went through times of hunger every 5-10 years , not to mention never having enough food anyway . 
  my grandmother had no schooling . 
  my grandfather had only primary education at a priest 's school , he was a son of a wealthy peasant and the local butcher . 
  then the ussr came . 
  they loved it . 
  they got free schools , free education ( free even up to uni level to my parents ) , they got class equality , they got laws that protected them from rape and murder ( but of course , did not protect them from stalin 's brutality , my great-grandfather , the rich village butcher spent 5 yrs in the gulag ) . 
  my grandparents do n't seem to mind that gulag part anymore though , as surprising as it was . 
  they are so grateful for the quality of life that they got compared to the romanian regime that they have a very rosy view of the ussr . 
  my grandmothers even got pensions for being housewives ... how neat is that ? 
  obviously the gdp and the economy was kinda shit , but it was far better than what they had . 
  they had equality ( everyone got not too much , hah ) and stability . 
  they had guaranteed healthcare , guaranteed education , guaranteed jobs , guaranteed retirement . 
  to them , it was the most they could want . 
  my parents are different . 
  they grew up in the 60s-70s and their view is a bit more complex . 
  they agree that the stability was very nice , life was much more worry free . 
  at the same time of course , we 're quite well off now compared to back then , so we ` won ' so to speak after the collapse of the ussr . 
  however , many people did not ( in russia at least ) . 
  different countries are different . 
  poland and czech republic got really fucked by the ussr . 
  baltic countries even more to some degree . 
  romania , well , it depends on which part i guess . 
  i think the comparison on the chart is a bit disingenuous . 
  ukraine or belarus or romania would n't magically become as prosperous as western euro nations simply because of no communism . 
  different cultures and all . 
  however , yes , most of romania would be better off , especially without an idiot like ceausescu . 
  edit : btw , my grandparents hate romanians with all their soul . 
  our town berlintsi was in briceni raion . 
  our town was mostly jewish , everyone had some jewish-german ancestry . 
  most of us were massacred by the nazis . 
  but guess who did the dirty work ? 
  romanians of course . 
  rounded our village up to the bathhouse and shot everyone . 
  nazis watched , romanians did the dirty work . 
  my father 's grandparents escaped , my mother 's only partially escaped . 
  my father was n't jewish , my mother was however . 
  my father 's father recounts how he watched the romanians execute his best friend 's family and then finish his best friend off with rifle butts after the first volley blew his arm off . 
  the screams ... 
   i do n't think it 's specifically white privilege though , it 's just the human condition . 
  it 's a human condition , yes , but the reason why the term ` white privilege ' exists is because whites hold the position of power and wealth . 
  a citizen of maghreb also emphasises more with his kind , but he has little to no power or wealth . 
  it 's the sociological theory that racism = power + prejudice . 
  yes , blacks can be also prejudiced , but it is a bit inaccurate to call it ` racism ' because black prejudice does n't have any real societal effects on whites that hurt whites to any noticeable extent . 
   there 's nothing wrong with being human and people should n't be shamed for that , as long as in their actions they try to overcome the unfairness of the way their brains work . 
  i see where you 're coming from , but i 'd like to add a little correction : there is something wrong with this and we need to not only to make actions to overcome that , but to also admit that we have that and that it is wrong . 
  reddit is a good example of a demographic that 's largely in denial , i have doubts as to how well most redditors will integrated with a diverse community . 
  i understand that poles have no reason to be thankful , unfortunately russia fucked up poland far and wide ( for which i am deeply sorry , i hate stalin too , he fucked ussr up too ) , but i find it amusing how all the poles pretend that jews do n't exist . 
  a good portion of poles and balts on / r/europe say that stalin was worse than hitler , again , a very selfish comparison . 
  fucking infuriating at times , because of how bloody single-minded it is . 
  whilst my people got genocided until they nearly did n't exist , you had your gnp hurt , boo fuckin ' hoo . 
  i realise stalin also killed a lot of poles , but this thread is about gnp and there was no polish genocide ( not one perpetrated by the soviets anyway , nazis planned to eventually kill 2/3 slavs and enslave 1/3 , a fact that poles have a hard time grasping and also hitler planned the same for balts eventually , a fact that balts * never * seem to grasp ) . 
  i would be marked thrice for hitler : once for being jewish on my mother 's side , twice for being slav on my father 's side and thrice for being gay . 
  i can assure you , i have a very different opinion of nazis and the ussr liberating berlintsi , the town in northern moldova/bessarabia that ussr liberated . 
  well , sure , i know that 's how it works , but that 's really bad . 
  it 's a fundamentally racist thought pattern . 
  if you do n't emphasise with blacks as much as whites , you wo n't emphasise with them when they 're born and have lived in your country too . 
  they 're people like you too , but subconsciously they 're worth less to you . 
  reddit ( though not always / r/europe ) likes to deny that racism and white privilege exists , but only a cursory look at how most of us think can easily prove that wrong . 
  that 's funny , you 're gay too ? 
  what a coincidence 0_0 i do n't live in russia anymore though , us now . 
  personally , while i am sad that i can not be openly lgbt in russia , the situation in russia is hardly unique , i would n't think of being openly gay in ukraine either ( my mother is ukrainian , some friends of ours live there ) . 
  same goes for moldova , where my grandparents live . 
  being openly gay is a good way to get beat up really hard in all three countries . 
  of course , nobody on / r/europe mentions this , you 'd think ukraine is lgbt heaven and russia is mordor . 
  to be fair , i feel that ukraine will get better soon in terms of gay rights , ukraine is looking westwards after all , eventually some of the western liberal social values will rub off on it . 
  who knows . 
  doubt it will get much better . 
  ** note ** : i do n't necessarily agree with you on blaming the russian lgbt community however . 
  smells of victim blaming . 
  i know reddit loves to do that in regards to gays ( i 've given up on explaining why gay pride parades are important ) but there is a fine line to walk here . 
  yes , i think the russian gay community could find slightly less ` in your face ' ways to achieve its aims , but at the same time blaming them for situation is n't fair . 
  though i also agree that it is n't really a particular fault of putin here , in this case he 's only reflecting what the people feel about gays . 
  a shame too , ussr felt a bit more open in this regard , at least all sexuality was repressed , hah . 
  pfft , they 're not white , so they 're basically subhuman savages who do n't deserve our pity !, 
  only good , german lives matter . 
   it could be that without nazis stalin 's armies would go much further than germany ... the idea of exporting the revolution was n't dead before invention of nuclear weapons . 
  yeah , only if you ignore the whole history behind stalin and trotsky and their respective ideals about the future of the ussr ... trotsky may have made a much better leader , more liberal and possibly less repressive -- however he also favoured a worldwide revolution and that would have led to more wars . 
  stalin was more pragmatic , he only cared about revolution in one country , his personal fiefdom/torture chamber , aka the ussr . 
  he would expand to form a buffer zone perhaps , but not any farther than conquering poland and romania quite likely . 
  he knew he had to be careful not to piss off the west , i even wonder if he would have went as far as poland really . 
  he took poland in 1939 along with hitler because he had only two choices : let hitler do all the work and get a border with ussr even closer to moscow , or make a pact with hitler and get an extra buffer zone against hitler , also conveniently taking back what was lost in brest-litovsk , a sore point for russia . 
  i know a lot of poles will rag on how stalin was worse than hitler or the same as hitler and how the molotov-ribbentrop proved that he was just as bad of an aggressor as hitler , but a fact that mostly everyone here seems to overlook/deny is that ussr actually desperately tried to make a defensive pact with the west against hitler right before molotov-ribbentrop . 
  too bad the west actually hated stalin far more than hitler , a funny fucking fact when you consider how self-righteous the euros on this sub get about not supporting hitler and stalin supposedly supporting hitler . 
  west only wanted to steer hitler east , let him conquer poland and then ussr , thereby diverting his expansionist lust and taking out a communist ussr , which was deemed a bigger threat to the west . 
  sure , stalin was a mass-murdering maniac , i wo n't defend him at all there . 
  but the history of wwii is n't as simple as some people here make it . 
  west sold poland for a twopence , a false hope that hitler would devour you and move onto ussr instead of bothering the profits of the west . 
  fortunately the west is much better now , i 'm a very ardent eu supporter myself . 
  however , west was n't always as it is now , in the 1930s they were a bunch of pricks playing a cynical game of bleeding hitler against the east with no regard for the western allies in the east . 
   soviets did n't make 22 thousand tanks before the war just to defend themselves well , again , if you do n't read history at all it 's a lot easier to make assertions like this .

  that 's not political criticism , the article in question was n't banned for its title . 
  stomakhin is an entirely crazy guy who supported ideas of extermination of the russians , nuclear bombing of russia , terrorist attacks by caucasus emirate and so on . 
  in his article `` crimea is ukraine '' ( [ the article on his site ] ( http://stomahin.info/articl/krym.htm ) ) he wrote that russia must be defeated and then erased from the world map , and that he does n't care if the russians in crimea who voted on the referendum would be drown in sea or burned in ovens . 
  stomakhin serves the second term in prison for incitement of hatred currently , because the first term was n't enough and he continued to do his thing like nothing has happened . 
  i doubt he would stay free for a long while saying similar things in any western european country . 
   a poster-collage depicting three people , two of them ( in the form of soldiers of the third reich ) look like the the pic in question : https://i.io.ua/img_su/large/0093/87/00938724_n2.jpg i agree with you on this one . 
  the opinion of linguistic expert ( `` the humiliation of the honor and dignity of an individual person or a group of persons on the basis of their relationship towards religion '' ) looks very far-fetched here . 
  they just analyzed a lot of pictures at once from tsvetkov 's vk , most of them really contained hate speech , but with some of them they went overboard . 
  however , these `` gay putins '' and other funny stuff form a very small minority of the list of extremist materials . 
  [ that 's the breakdown ] ( http://www.sova-center.ru/racism-xenophobia/publications/2017/03/d36630/ ) by independent anti-xenophobia watchdog sova center of 785 new entries added to the extremist list in 2016 ( google translate ) :  * materials of modern russian nationalists - 604 ;  * other nationalists - 6 ;  * classics of racism - 2 ;  * islamist militants and other appeals of political islamists to violence - 69 ;  * muslim materials ( said nursi 's books , materials of banned organizations , including hizb ut-tahrir , and much more ) - 18 ;  * orthodox fundamentalists - 3 ;  * religious materials ( materials of jehovah 's witnesses , etc. ), 
  - 5 ;  * radical anti-russian statements from ukraine ( we separate them from `` other nationalists '' ) - 11 ;  * materials of the ukrainian media and the internet - 13 ;  * materials inciting to unrest and violence - 27 ;  * peaceful opposition materials - 2 ;  * a large heterogeneous array of texts , blocked entirely - 1 ;  * parody materials , banned as serious - 2 ;  * materials that are banned explicitly by mistake - 2 ;  * materials created , in our opinion , by people in an altered state of consciousness - 2 ;  * non-identifiable materials - 18 ( including 4 excluded ) . 
  by a huge margin the courts ban content created by russian ethnic nationalists and islamists . 
  amount of legitimate political content wrongly added to the list is negligible . 
   everything i see on here would be constitutionally-protected free speech in the us . 
  oh , sure . 
  the first amendment is something the us can be incredibly proud about . 
  it 's not that easy to copy it though , even the western europe did n't copy it . 
  overall so far the `` hate speech '' laws seem to be necessary in russia , considering that russia is a multi-national country , there should be some way to fight against ethnic tensions . 
  the recorded hate-motivated violence in russia is lower than ever . 
  in 2000s there were nationalist gangs who were mass-murdering immigrants , but the police seems to resolved that disbanding nationalist movements , jailing its leaders and ordinary members . 
   the moscow times fake news hit again . 
   in the photograph , putin has red lips and painted eyelashes , and a suggestive caption reads , `` they say there are many of them , but there are n't any among the people i know . '' the moscow times missed the first sentence entirely . 
  there must be a lot of them , but none of them are among my friends '' . 
  that 's why that _ particular picture with text _ was added to to the list of extremist materials , not just any generic suggestion that putin is gay . 
   officials have not provided a copy of the image , but it likely resembles the photo at the top of this story . 
  oh , i am sure that a nazi with account full of swastikas , ss , attacks on jews , democracy and immigrants will share poster with caption `` stop homophobia '' . 
   so less than 30 % actually want it brought back only if 0 % of remain voters support these measures . 
  support for death penalty in britain overall is around 50 % too : http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32061822, 
  i am still uneasy about it . 
  vedomosti discuss some ways how this law can be abused : https://www.vedomosti.ru/economics/articles/2017/03/20/681812-biznesmeni-nalogovogo-rezidentstva and it 's impressive how fast these laws pass -- laws in the interests of selected few , or maybe even a single person . 
  a ** paid shill ** is a person who disagree with me in the internet . 
  thanks !, 
  at least 2 killed were not even russian -- a young woman from azerbaijan and a student from kazakhstan . 
  also st. petersburg and moscow are the regions with lowest putin support and highest support of liberal parties . 
  thanks to them . 
  to be honest , i did n't expect that . 
  good riddance , indeed . 
  i still have warm feelings to soros , because in 1990s when russia was piss-poor , his grants to talented students in russia were very helpful . 
  kudos to him for that . 
  but this training of agents of influence controlled from outside has no place in an independent country . 
   http://gtlodz.eu it seems this site gives only thumbnails when linked from outside . 
  nice trams . 
  i do n't care , i did n't give a single fuck after the recent terrorist acts in europe either . 
  shit happens , all over the world . 
  they did n't lit up anything after boko haram terrorist attacks in nigeria either . 
  the west did n't give a fuck when the terrorists blew up apartment buildings in moscow in 1999 , while it was our 9/11 . 
  instead they pushed conspiracy theory that russians bombed themselves and actively tried to obstruct the second chechen war . 
  i long time used to this hypocritical shit , so i would care only my city , russia and our friends . 
   that 's historical fact . 
  old ukrainian language in 11th century ? 
  yeah , it 's approximately as historical as other bs you told here . 
  and it was n't `` ukraine '' , it was a _ ukraina _ , meaning just borderlands . 
   you were called ` provocators ' at the time . 
  no , they were called ` historians ' at the time . 
  term ` kievan rus ' started to be prevalent only in the soviet union , but [ other terms still were in use ] ( https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=%d0%94%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b2%d0%bd%d1%8f%d1%8f+%d0%a0%d1%83%d1%81%d1%8c%2c%d0%9a%d0%b8%d0%b5%d0%b2%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b0%d1%8f+%d0%a0%d1%83%d1%81%d1%8c%2c%d0%94%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b2%d0%bd%d0%b5%d1%80%d1%83%d1%81%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b5+%d0%b3%d0%be%d1%81%d1%83%d0%b4%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%be&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=25&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3b%2c%d0%94%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b2%d0%bd%d1%8f%d1%8f%20%d0%a0%d1%83%d1%81%d1%8c%3b%2cc0%3b.t1%3b%2c%d0%9a%d0%b8%d0%b5%d0%b2%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b0%d1%8f%20%d0%a0%d1%83%d1%81%d1%8c%3b%2cc0%3b.t1%3b%2c%d0%94%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b2%d0%bd%d0%b5%d1%80%d1%83%d1%81%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b5%20%d0%b3%d0%be%d1%81%d1%83%d0%b4%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%be%3b%2cc0 ) . 
   ` ukraine ' in old-ukrainian is dated back to 1187 . 
  i loled . 
  that 's ancient ukrs-tier . 
   referring to ` kyivan rus ' as ` old-russia ' is a sign of olgyno shill who really needs a bit of integrity . 
  til there were olgino shills since 19th century , because that 's when terms `` old rus ' '' , `` kievan rus ' '' and `` old russian state '' were introduced . 
  yeah , i really have poor english comprehension skills . 
  i did n't know that single `` lel '' can possibly mean that much of stuff . 
   by saying crimeans are happy about their decision , implyies that crimeans decided to become russian . 
  when in fact we know that 's not true . 
  of course , it 's not true . 
  they did n't decide to become russian . 
  they were russian all the time . 
   first was russia taking crimea from ukraine , and afterwards the referendum . 
  eh , what ? 
  the referendum happened at march 16 , crimea joined russia at march 18 . 
  you should get the most basic facts straight . 
   what part do you not agree what part ? 
  you 've quoted my `` crimeans are happy about their decision '' and added `` lel '' . 
  i disagree with 1st , 2nd and 3rd letter . 
  crimeans already voted pro-russia in 1994 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_referendum,_1994 in response ukraine scrapped crimean 's 1991 declaration of sovereignty . 
  they never wanted to live in ukraine in the first place . 
   your metodichka is been outdated , my retartded comrade oh , you are so buttmad after being confronted with facts . 
   that 's expected , but still nice . 
  you did n't even notice that i am not even denying the involvement of russian military . 
  i question the scale , but not the fact of intervention . 
   funny video with kobzon and burned buryat . 
  the video is only funny if you do n't think about all ukrainians he killed before getting injured . 
  yeah , i read his interview and he was pretty successful in blocking debaltsevo 's road . 
  is that scary russian army you are always talking about ? 
  one buryat against 42 million strong nation ? 
  ukraine ( 42 million ) vs buryats and chechens ( 2 million combined ) -- and you still managed to lose . 
  that 's some pretty pathetic performance of ukrainian military then , i would be ashamed of that fact instead of talking about it all the time . 
   rostov 's cemetary you really used these photos of cemetery of unidentified people as a proof . 
  lol . 
  there are a lot of such cemeteries both in russia and ukraine , you have to bury hobos somewhere . 
  oh , that denial . 
   they ca n't genuinely like living in russia , they must be wanting to get back to ukraine deep inside , because ... hmm ... 
  i do n't know . 
  for some reason . 
  the size of shadow economy is estimated using indirect methods and included into official gdp estimates . 
  at least that 's how it happens in russia . 
  reading his biography in wikipedia : * he was a candidate from sps+y abloko in electoral district n204 of moscow during parliamentary elections 2003 . 
  he lost , got 2nd place with 8.6 % . 
  * he initiated nomination of dissident [ bukovsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_bukovsky ) as a candidate for 2008 presidential race , bu the electoral committee refused to register him as a candidate . 
  it 's the first time i hear about the whole affair , bukovsky was an absurd candidate , because he lived in the uk and was nobody in russian politics .

  i would probably confuse czech with it . 
  i have never heard slovak . 
  :( written bulgarian is obvious , i could probably recognize it being spoken as well . 
  serbo-croatian is also easy , but do n't expect me to identify macedonian or slovenian . 
  english and german are easy to recognize , as i speak both . 
  i might recognize dutch as well . 
  scandinavian germanic languages are one big mess to me . 
  speaking of accents , i ca n't tell russian - and romanian-accented english apart if the accent is not 100 % broad . 
  they 're very similar to me . 
  the uk is much smaller than russia . 
  you also do not need an id here in russia to buy a short-distance train ticket . 
  if your ticket has a seat reservation , then you require an id . 
  russian intercity buses are even worse than russian intercity trains . 
  right now there 's a moscow-wide crackdown on them in the name of counter-terrorism , since many of the buses are semi-legal and you do n't need an id to buy a ticket . 
  now i 'm getting into the realm of fantasy , but * easing * visa restrictions simultaneously with implementing sanctions against the political elite would show even tv-fed russians that the sanctions are not against them . 
  the other idea from the same realm is eu pushing ukraine towards federalization . 
  that 's a separate problem . 
  has putin tried to solve it in any way ? 
  no , he sent `` totally not russian soldiers '' into crimea instead . 
  i do n't know what happened behind the closed doors , but he should 've pushed the eu not to accept the outcome of the uprising . 
  or flood the country with eu/russian peacekeepers as soon as the deal was signed . 
  what he did instead has already overshadowed the actions of the protesters in the eyes of ukrainians . 
  i support sanctions . 
  but they should be well-targeted ones . 
  arrest the bank accounts and seize other assets of our mps and members of the cabinet . 
  send their kids and wives ( even if they had a tactical divorce ) back to moscow . 
  my only fear is that our government will as usual retaliate with something that hurts russian people worse than europe . 
  the whole russian government system depends on one man . 
  his life is the weakness . 
  they asked him if there 's a point of holding one : will he agree to annex or not . 
  i do n't watch russian news , actually . 
  i 've changed the designation of the right sector to a less controversial one , but i still view people with `` totally not inspired by a swastika '' insignia with suspicion . 
  i 'm not talking about their own emblem , but the ones of its constituents . 
   her clothes were itching and she longed to take them all off and just lie on the bed . 
  she had turned the air conditioning way down to its bottom temperature setting , way up to its top fan setting . 
  what she wanted more than anything else in the world at the moment was goose pimples . 
  then a hot shower , then a cool one , then lying on a towel , on the bed again , drying in the air conditioning . 
  then reading the message . 
  maybe more goose pimples . 
  maybe all sorts of things .

  mostly harmless * every single russian would 've died from that . 
  cold wind + wet hair is to us what fans are to koreans . 
  but their complete winter kit consists of a single scarf , no jacket , no cap , no winter boots . 
  should 've reformed your spelling to make more sense . 
  taoiseach should be pronounced ta-oi-sea-ch . 
   brits are migrating back to our lakes too early by several weeks , people are scared we might get a cold snap and they 'd all die my first thought after reading this wrong was `` but brits do n't feel the cold ! '', 
  oh , the famous concrete bomb . 
  did you know the radius of the damage caused by one is equal to 1/2 of the diameter of the bomb itself ? 
  is n't that amazing ? 
  also , til real concrete bombs [ exist ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/concrete_bomb ) . 
  i propose the safest route , along the eurasian coast : norway , russia , north korea , china , vietnam , etc. 
  those who 'll manage to reach the black sea can rest and recuperate in the olympic village . 
  latvian riflemen are offended by your insinuations . 
  edit : oh , you meant fighter * planes * , my bad . 
  is n't it also famous for its cats and goats ? 
  ** russia ** it 's st. petersburg , the capital of russian empire . 
  it 's often called the cultural capital of russia , it is the birthplace of the revolution , the survivor of the leningrad blockade and the city where mr. putin and many of his friends come from . 
  the aforementioned mr. putin has transferred the constitutional court and iirc the navy command there , but it 's not a city that matters in national politics . 
  everyone of note has moved to moscow , and it 's a passive city , unlike yekaterinburg , for example . 
  petersburgers are widely considered intellectual snobs that speak a pretentious , but incorrect dialect of russian . 
  they themselves consider us muscovites a bunch of uneducated villagers . 
  because she 's glib like 10,000 used car salesmen . 
  you can lustrate them without banning them . 
  enough dirty laundry , and no one will vote for them again . 
  right now it does n't look like they 're trying to unify the people . 
  they 've proposed to ban the cpu and the por , they 've repealed the regional languages law . 
  they 're pushing as hard as they can to destroy any opposition from the east before the elections . 
  do you think repealing the regional languages law was a wise decision ? 
  i do n't think it did anyone any harm , but this can be used to further brand you as russophobes . 
  yes she is , we 'll probably hear more of them if she wins the election . 
  neither is okay . 
  a complete victory should n't mean the other side is destroyed . 
  for example , south africa would be much worse off if not for the truth and reconciliation commission . 
  it 's ok to occupy a central square and throw firebombs at the police , not a big deal . 
  it 's not a good idea to prosecute either side at the moment . 
  what do you propose ? 
  arrest everyone who shot at the protesters and threw molotovs at the police ? 
  uk should 've been forced to pull a germany : deport all unionists from ni and hand it over to roi . 
  since we finally won eurovision a few years back , we have relaxed our collective sphincter and can enjoy the show instead of bitching about the latest failure of our nominee or the anti-russian eurovision conspiracy . 
  it probably had an automatic gearbox . 
  shafted ? 
  do n't worry , you 'll get all the land east of the elbe for your troubles . 
  and lose all the land east of the vistula ... 
  along with the sound guy who screwed up the first verse of the olympic anthem . 
  i 've drifted downwards since the last time i took the test ... http://www.politicalcompass.org/crowdchart.php?showform=&amp;newname=orthoxerox&amp;newec=-6.62&amp;newsoc=-2.31, 
  the rules of succession demand an election . 
  will , for example , sechin let medvedev run unopposed ? 
  i think the fight for the seat will destroy the system , unless we have gone 100 % byzantine . 
  vikings and the great northern war of peter the great . 
  that 's probably it . 
  why do you think the vertical of power will survive after the death of putin ? 
  it basically depends on no one amounting to anything . 
  what kind of barbarian would wear a hat indoors ? 
  or the holograms !, 
  or washing your hands !, 
  or the ~ ~ von ~ ~ neumann architecture !, 
  seems like our cultures have a lot in common , not just sprinkle-happy priests . 
   you would be hard pressed to name one nordic comedy show the ylvises , or what 's their name . 
  the fox and kygyzstan guys .

  i 'm a liberal by us marks and i 'm a part of this system too . 
  no more mind-boggling than the naivete of the american public or / r/politics ... 
  i know you 're not saying that those two are n't naive , but when you make a specific jab at this sub you act as if you do n't share the same problem . 
  if you simply call us out for being a black pot when you 're an equally black kettle ... 
  it just seems a tad stuck-up without extra context . 
  americans have a long history of dismissing europeans just as europeans have a long history of calling americans names . 
  yup , same here , minus the coulter thing . 
  evil , powerful , outspoken women -- my thing as well . 
  but the amanda knox one is the one where i can really identify . 
  i was very fascinated with her . 
  but do n't worry , she might not be really innocent for all we know , 
  speak for yourself , you 're norwegian  you never experienced it . 
  of course , neither did i , as a russian . 
  but whenever a non-russian mentions the word ` federalists ' i snort , because we 're a federation of a sort too . 
  it 's just that we are that sort of a most brutal hellish scenario that a eurosceptic would have you believe is being cooked up in brussels . 
  well right , but it was n't really a question . 
  it was more of a statement . 
  phrasing it as a question helps ease people into accepting the statement , but most people can cite several reasons as to the american insularity . 
  ah , nola too , eh ? 
  i went to loyola new orleans . 
   right on st charles , with the audubon park right across the street from our campus . 
  fun city , very nice to walk around ( unlike every other us city i 've been to ) . 
  mardi gras was pretty neat - it gave the city that sort of euro identity you do n't see in the rest of the cities here in the states . 
  lot of interesting stuff about the city in all . 
  ultimately , it was too small for me though . 
  i loved living in it , but finding work in it is n't the same as in a big city . 
  many more opportunities in an actual metropolis . 
  see , i think you just described how i feel . 
  everyone is racist , merely in different ways and it is in the nature of humans to be racist . 
  there are some pretty damning studies proving that [ children are by default racist ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2566511/ ) . 
  extended analysis :  in fact , even babies have a distinct preference for faces of their own ethnic background . 
  this has been extended beyond just african and caucasian faces . 
  this effect is not observed in newborns , but it is in three-month-olds . 
  the reason for this makes sense . 
  we have a cognitive bias called the mere-exposure effect  which makes us like things just because we 've seen them before . 
  babies are mostly exposed to people of their own ethnic backgrounds , so they start to prefer them . 
    an analogous effect can be observed in adults using implicit attitude tests . 
  by measuring differences in reactions times associating different groups with positive vs negative vs neutral words , you can see that your brain is faster at associating certain groups with certain emotions because there are stronger connections between those groups and those feelings . 
    this effect is measurable in perfectly nice , non-bigoted people . 
  even black people have been found to have an implicit negative attitude toward black people due to societal conditioning . 
   here 's a link to a bunch of implicit attitude tests if you 're interested : https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/demo/selectatest.html   the point of all this is that our evolutionary history has biased us to favor those who are similar to us . 
  it helped us form cohesive social units . 
  human cultural evolution with cities , states , countries , etc. 
  has advanced much more quickly than our biology . 
  therefore we need to use culture to overcome our own inherent prejudice . 
   so in a way it 's kind of depressing , but only by recognizing the problem can we hope to solve it . 
    the initial racial preference causes you to only surround yourself with people of your own ethnicity so you never interact with different people . 
  if you never interact with them then it 's much harder to empathize with them and much easier to believe that they are inferior . 
  there 's a tendency to think of them as ` other ' and therefore ` not-human ' aka a racist ideology . 
  when you view people as ` other ' then you do n't feel bad when you do things that harm them in order to help yourself . 
  yes , but the thing is that the ` worldly ' view puts things into perspective . 
  russians who do n't travel much are very similar to americans who do n't travel much . 
  both exhibit similar patterns of thought in relation to this issue - the excessive emphasis being placed on small differences . 
  the differences do matter , you are correct of course . 
  but if your threshold for those said ` differences ' is so minute , then almost every country is wildly diverse by that marker . 
  yep , the latter point is the truest one you have made so far . 
  american cities are indeed more mixed and you are indeed more likely to interact with other people . 
  that is very much true . 
  but why do americans seem so strangely insular then ? 
  i have never met a developed nation as insular as the us . 
  the rest of the world hardly seems to matter whenever i am spending time in the us . 
  it 's like a magical land , not really a part of the globe . 
  people back home often regularly cross borders and clash with * actual * different cultures , ones that speak different languages and are n't assimilated at all . 
  ones that do not assume a sort of a ` submissive ' stance of accommodation that immigrants are more likely to pull off than tourists or other international travellers . 
  people back home are acutely aware of other nations and what it 's like to be of a different nationality . 
  people in the us ask me the dumbest questions possibly on a daily basis , ones that stun me with their naivete . 
  my favourite one so far ? 
  that foreigners think in their own language . 
  you do n't get this in russia . 
  this is n't people being smarter or dumber . 
  it 's a result of the us being a superpower surrounded by two oceans . 
  the american culture is so dominant that there is no heavy exposure that americans receive of truly independent foreign cultures . 
  it 's interesting to note that from a perspective of someone who majored in the study of the antiquity , the romans were described by greeks almost * exactly * as i describe the americans . 
  almost every stereotype is similar . 
  but the point about americans/romans being the dominant culture is the strongest one . 
  which actually applied to the greeks themselves too . 
  persons who were the products of the greco-roman culture often lacked that intrinsic understanding of things being done many different ways in various lands that other ` lesser ' cultures were painfully aware of . 
  almost every white i know is ` iffy ' about black one way or another , some very openly racist and some not , but still uncomfortable in certain situations , or mindful of race where it would not come to me to notice such distinctions . 
  it 's a consciousness only they have . 
  a russian can ` catch ' it , i suppose , but it 's not a default amongst us . 
  russians are plenty hateful , but there is a certain ` racialist ' mindset that you have to have . 
  we do n't have too many blacks outside of moscow and we do n't consider asians to be different from us . 
  though the lack of distinction that russians make between ourselves and asians may be an indicator of a sort . 
  sure , we have our neo-nazis too , but a regular person does n't see asians as any different . 
  *** anyway , these were n't very good examples , but if you are asking about racism in the us because you do n't think americans are racist , then that 's quite amusing to me , because racism has been a deeply-seated historico-cultural feature of the american society . 
  there are lots of small examples everywhere that i see , but it 's pointless to go over each one . 
  people are n't racist to the point where they will disregard a ` good ' black man but it does n't stop them from disregarding blacks in general or a black person without knowing them . 
  i think you really , really , really overestimate the cultural differences of the different americans . 
  that 's ok though , i usually see this effect happen to people who did not live in several countries for at least a year . 
  now , i do n't know where you actually lived for extended periods of time ... 
  but i lived in five countries for more than at least a year and in six different states for at least more than a year each . 
  that gives you a very nice perspective ... 
  the differences in the us are so small and superficial that it hardly matters on a global scale . 
  it 's most definitely a different experience growing up white and black in the us but so is growing up in different cities in russia . 
  our cities vary rather dramatically unlike the homogenised cities of the us ( though as usual , the soviets attempted to rectify that problem with their [ famous cookie-cutter industrial-style architecture ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihdfd2rkrsi ) [ animated intro poking fun at that form one of our most classical films ] ) . 
  and i 've lived in some very unique cities here , such as new orleans . 
  that was perhaps the only us city that i felt had a ` soul ' like the ones i felt in europe . 
  nola is a very special metropolis . 
  too bad it shrunk so much after katrina , which is when i got there . 
  it 's barely half of what it used to be .

  last time i checked the public support of nato was only growing . 
  apparently the strategy has n't worked so far . 
   i would prefer if europe , us , and russia put aside differences and worked together as friends instead of russia vs west/us cold war . 
  so would i. 
  but that 's not gon na happen . 
  neither of these are ready to `` put aside their differences '' . 
   a better strategy would be to strengthen the eu < . .  about your edit : the dearest leader is not a strategist , as it can be seen from the long ass string of failures and fuckups in the economy and politics . 
  plus it 's impossible for russia to get any serious advantage on the eu . 
  so , there 's really nothing to discuss . 
  you read way too much into that . 
  the gov ' t economic policies are reactive , not proactive . 
  just like the dearest leader has always been a sprinter , tactic , instead of developing any coherent strategy for dealing with the soviet legacy . 
   it seems he is making a high risk strategy of trying to break apart the eu by scaring civilians out of syria granted , i do n't know jack about the syrian conflict , but , as a rule of thumb : once you allow armed men in camo to roam freely in your country , be sure you will see civilians leaving in droves . 
  it 's , like , a fucking law of nature . 
  works everywhere , no matter what side you like more . 
  so , i do n't really buy into these sobbing stories about peaceful syrians being purposely bombed in hospitals . 
  if they stopped shouting what they always shout while waving aks above their heads , i might be less suspicious . 
  sorry if it sounded harsh . 
  my point is that the gov ' t stopped burning reserves after the near fiasco in 2014 . 
  imo , the economy is tanking because the most valuable assets , such as gazprom and the likes , were overpriced before , due to ridiculously high oil prices . 
  now it 's just getting back to normal . 
  back to the sad reality of non-diversified economy , i might add . 
   russia burns through the last of its reserves that 's not entirely correct . 
  russia 's foreign currency reserves have been [ growing for the last year ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/foreign-exchange-reserves ) .

  i just reminded you of the fact that russians have lived there for three centuries . 
  i know , some facts do not fit into the comfortable narrative . 
  except it was you who first raised the issue of the recent annexation and accused me of trying to justify that . 
  how is it not a strawman argument ?

  nope , i just pointed out that a significant russian population in crimea was not `` artificially created by the soviet union '' . 
  they 've been living there since the 18th century . 
  so did ukrainians . 
  i did n't say a word about the annexation . 
  meanwhile , your response a textbook example of a strawman argument . 
   does n't affect the legality that goes without saying . 
  you 're making a strawman argument .

   anyway , my general thought is that you can not fix russia by applying european or american solutions because its neither . 
  you ca n't force people to choose someone else by making life harder because life in russia has been hard for the past 1000 years . 
  well put , could n't agree more . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=2726191&amp;tid=109524 ) the story did n't get much coverage on tv in particular . 
  former resident of chertanovo checking in :d, 
  you can read the whole article if you are interested . 
  the thing is , the crimean khanate was a ** turkic ** vassal state of the ottoman empire before the annexation by the russian empire . 
  ukraine had no business down there . 
   does n't make sense . 
  it does . 
   moscow has the largest muslim population in europe , with estimates suggesting that between [ 1.5 and 2 million ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/moscow-largest-muslim-city-europe-faithful-face-discrimination-public-authorities-2020858 ) of the russian capital 's population are of the faith . 
  my guess is that it 's about [ one past incident ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7resf5xira ) that remains vivid in memory . 
   but none of the major television networks -- including channel one , rossia-1 , ntv and moscow 's tvts -- made a single mention of the incident in their newscast well , that 's not entirely correct . 
  [ ntv 's '' \u0427\u041f '' report ( video ) ] ( http://www.ntv.ru/sobytie/%d0%a3%d0%b1%d0%b8%d0%b9%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%be%20%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b1%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%ba%d0%b0%20%d0%b2%20%d0%9c%d0%be%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b2%d0%b5 ) ; the people 's gathering [ at the crime scene ] ( http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/1610336 ) ; muscovites brought [ flowers and toys to the metro entrance and victim 's house ] ( http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/1610317 ) . 
  that being said , 1tv and rossia-1 once again failed to deliver , as expected . 
   ukraine 's russian majority areas were artificially created by the soviet union through a state-organized famine and russian immigration .

   jan sjunnesson , a reporter for local news service ** avpixlat ** , which partnered with nine on the story , wrote that the nine crew ran into the trouble before reaching rinkeby when a man approached asking why they wanted to film in rinkeby . 
  he then deliberately drove over the cameraman 's foot .

  it 's cool to be square in here . 
  everyone who wanted democracy moved to other countries , while private businesses were being destroyed with corruption and raiding . 
  the result ? 
  death of the middle class . 
  hordes upon hordes of uneducated white trash . 
  all they want is to prove that they are superior to anyone else . 
  you know why i 'm on reddit ? 
  because i 'm sick of those people . 
  i apologize -- it 's not nice to call them out , and i 'll probably make an impression of a hateful person , but it 's true . 
  i 'm sick of that disgusting homophobic crowd who live by laws of jail inmates . 
  i 'm sick of that brash behavior from people born with a single purpose in life to be the biggest assholes possible to everyone . 
  i never even reply to russians on the internet anymore , it 's pointless . 
  it 's like arguing with a monkey -- you 'll just get shit thrown at you . 
  they are like savages -- and you 've seen our dashcam videos , people climbing god knows what , 37 million dollar watches on politicians . 
  the worst of reddit does n't even compare with those people . 
  but the biggest testament to their arrogance is that many of them firmly believe the propaganda . 
  you have to be completely stupid and kicked in the head to do this . 
  but they do . 
  and until they do , you 'll likely wo n't have many friends from russia . 
  it 's sad , really . 
  i see it as clear as you do : you meet those people with a greeting and a smile , but all you get is a suspicious evil look . 
  and i understand what you feel . 
  not all russians are like that , but most are . 
  the environment here is incredibly hostile towards nice and educated people . 
  but the best people i know come from st. petersburg . 
  probably the most progressive city in russia . 
  try people from there -- they are not that far from europeans . 
  best of luck . 
   just some fun stuff . 
  ussr/russia has occupied estonia more than once . 
  so one time when they came here , they burned all the estonian books . 
  then they printed out their own to replace the burned books and claimed that before they came here , we had no culture , nothing in writing . 
  under this statement they basically tried to destroy our culture ( and largely succeeded ) . 
  unfortunately i have no links . 
  ah , i wish you had any links ... but this is ... this is just below what you 'd expect , even from ussr . 
  of all things , i hate fabrications of history the most . 
  but that is just beyond that . 
  to destroy people 's culture and claim they did n't have it is what i 'd expect from some dark sci-fi . 
   russians here did not watch the estonian news , despite there being a russian version on estonian tv every day . 
  they watched the russian goverment produced stuff . 
  and those swine have a nerve to protest ? ... i think there 's no cure for being russian . 
  pardon me , but stuff like this just enrages me . 
  either you learn to live like a citizen of a civilized country , or go back to your shithole motherland . 
  `` reconsider the the apology '' reminded me of george constanza taking back the tip from a waiter . 
  it 's the same degree of awkward . 
  you know , there was a great quote from one russian writer : `` taking back crimea was considered by russian government to be a an internal affair . 
  because everything happening in russia and in the world has been an internal affair for russia , since stalin . '', 
  i admit i have n't laughed at something political for a long time . 
  but this is spot-on . 
  you know , russia does n't act like a civilized country . 
  it acts like mafia , like a criminal mob . 
  apparently , everything it does is not to be judged or interrupted by anyone else . 
  it 's somehow a law that once you 're russian , you can be targeted by fsb or whatever in any country , and that country must just take it as it is . 
  russia continues to act like it 's the only country in the world which has to be considered with . 
  yes , i noticed that too . 
  i think poles are an incredible nation really -- very optimistic and friendly . 
  i still have great memories from my trip to poland . 
  never did i feel a hint of any hostility from people at all . 
  thank you . 
  i really wanted to learn about the soviet occupation of baltic states from facts , not from propaganda . 
  these events are continued to be denied by russian government . 
  thank you . 
  i 'll be sure to read these , saving for later , because it 's already night here . 
  these topics are taboo in russia . 
  the important part about the russian relationship with baltic countries is that today russia does n't even view itself as guilty of anything . 
  look at germany : everyone is cool with it today . 
  it has apologized , perhaps some would say that it was even more than necessary . 
  nobody in their mind will blame germany for wwii today -- in worst case they will blame nazis and hitler . 
  but russia ridiculed any attempts by baltic countries to receive any compensations for what happened to them , or at least just simple acknowledgement of what happened . 
  it did n't change much from soviet times at all . 
  i just meant to say that it 's very said and unnatural state of events . 
   i dont have a problem with people writing `` to berlin '' on their cars , whatever . 
  what i find less funny is this in the current days . 
  i do n't follow russian news because they are 90 % propaganda . 
  but when i do , i still regret it , because things like that happen more often then you might know . 
  russia has gone out of its way in the recent years to embarrass itself in any way possible , but this ? ... sometimes i just wish it all was just a bad dream . 
  we just ca n't have so many inbred people in one country ... or can we ? 
   fun fact : you probably know this picture - this was actually a very early retouch job , in the original version , the right soldier was wearing a second , looted watch did n't know that . 
  the irony . 
  i bet you 100 euros that if approached about it , russian politicians would say that 2 watches were needed for monitoring both moscow and berlin time . 
   my government has done lots of shit things as well . 
  maybe , but i 'm yet to hear about anyone from mi8 going to russia to ` silence ' a russian citizen because he was dangerous to the crown . 
  and yeah , i 'm basically asking for the criticism of my country , so it 'd be very dumb of me to get angry at people . 
  your comments are very interesting , thank you . 
  well , glad to know ussr did n't get its hands at least somewhere . 
  i really wish russia just stayed within its 17 million square kilometres of land and tried to actually solve its own domestic problems for once . 
  this was honestly the kind of post i was hoping to see . 
  thank you very much . 
  poland has suffered so much from russia , that i doubt my country will * ever * have enough shame to face it all . 
  as you noted , it started long before xxth century . 
  you know , there 's a joke : '' -- what was your sweetest revenge ? 
  -- i lived incredibly well '' . 
  of course i do n't say that poland is in any way having it easy -- but on my trip to the country , i saw that it was far better there than in russia . 
  the irony : years of hyper-profits from oil trade , and my country still is poor and full of inbred people . 
  it 's 2015 , and we are still playing ussr . 
  did n't know at all about the population transfers . 
  that 's the kind of things i wanted to learn about . 
  thank you again for making this comment . 
  thank you , did n't know about that . 
  yeah , i get that people in uk , for example , probably were n't really bullied by ussr in any way .

  have a fun winter !, 
  i support china , and have long done so . 
  the russian elites should purge themselves of their idiotic zapadnophilia once and for all . 
  russia today has two choices , and i suppose its better if these were to be made clear ( i.e. 
  via sanctions ) sooner rather than later : ( 1 ) join china , the future global superpower , and serve it from a relatively privileged position ; ( 2 ) piteously beg the west for the honor of being a slave to it and fighting china to the last russian . 
  idiot russian liberals seriously prefer the latter , but any reasonable person will pick the former . 
  if there are sanctions from europe and the us , i do hope russia retaliates in a like manner . 
  remember that agreement to not sell s-300 's to iran ? 
  invalidated . 
  nasa is reliant on russia for human spaceflight capabilities . 
  that 's just too bad . 
  supply routes to afghanistan depend on russian support to a considerable extent . 
  close them . 
  if the us/europe go so far as to sanction russian companies , well , there are opportunities here as well . 
  seizing foreign assets will hurt russia much more than the west , so that is a bad idea . 
  there are better methods . 
  i would recommend blocking google and facebook , for the purely humanitarian reason of protecting russians from nsa spying . 
  let yandex and vkontakte take their market share . 
  mikhail dobkin had resigned as head of the kharkov oblast state administration to run for the coming presidential elections . 
  he is now in a pre-trial detainment center of the sbu ( the ukrainian version of fsb/kgb ) . 
  `` i will hurt you for this . 
  i do n't know how yet , but give me time . 
  a day will come when you think yourself safe and happy , and suddenly your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth , and you 'll know the debt is paid . '', 
  there are more fascists per capita amongst the banderites . 
   they are allowed to study in moscow universities without any entering exams for free and so on . 
  while most of / u/bargerofhate 's points are true , this is a russian nationalist myth . 
  in theory , i would support a referendum in chechnya , for the reasons given by most of the other russians here . 
  in practice , the two times that chechnya assumed de facto independence ended catastrophically ( no pensions , criminalization , wahhabi camps , return of slavery , mass ethnic cleansing of russians that western human rightists could n't care less about ) . 
  will this time be different ? 
  i doubt it . 
  so realistically i think the status quo , imperfect is it might be , is much safer than renewed political experimentation . 
  here 's what a dagestani thinks about chechens : http://darussophile.com/2013/07/why-pugachev-residents-are-angry/#comment-19061 the cultural differences probably stem from the lowlander/highlander thing . 
  so i take it all the afghani and iraqi elections after 2001 and 2003 , respectively , were illegitimate ? 
  truly a heroic stand that is rightfully being applauded throughout the western media . 
  just like the [ resignations of al jazeera journalists ] ( http://rt.com/news/al-jazeera-rebels-phones-lebanon-281/ ) in 2012 over its syria and bahrain coverage . 
  truly marvelous to behold the consistency and high universal principles at play here . 
  they do n't arrest anybody when protests are sanction , and do n't beat anyone when they are peaceful - as in the rest of the civilized world ( aka not ukraine ) . 
  [ all 1.5 % of them ] ( http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/news/2014/03/02/n_5986737.shtml ) . 
  and that 's excluding the south/east oblasts . 
  it appears you 're right . 
  the rt article i read did n't make that explicitly clear . 
  for the most part , i do not understand the reasons for making this ... so overt . 
  with a referendum scheduled for may 25 - one that the russian crimeans were sure to `` win '' - things were coming along swimmingly as they were . 
  any overly visible military involvement would diminish the credibility of russia 's narrative ( of aggressive banderists ) , and besides provide a point around which ukrainians could rally around as opposed to being distracted by factional infighting and economic collapse . 
  government porn headquarters, 
  i try . 
  it 's a sure thing as / r/europe is dominated by liberal fanatics . 
  apparently , the russian flag has also just been raised . 
  unless recent events have drastically changed calculations , it would take decades for ukraine to join up - and that 's comitant on there being steady support for euro-integration across multiple future administrations . 
  you are not incorrect , of course , but as i said above , i just do n't think this issue is * critical * . 
  who constitute 12 % of the population . 
  short of them having chechen-like demographics , and i doubt that , they are just not going to be make a big difference . 
  ukraine has less than a third of russia 's population ( of which many are abroad anyway ) , about a tenth of its gdp , is a financial basketcase , and the western areas would be a net liability rather than an asset anyway in any integration scenario . 
  so in terms of international power , ukraine is a `` nice to have , '' but very far from `` must have '' so far as russia is concerned . 
  actually crimea has pretty good demographics by ukrainian standards - the fifth best birth rate by oblast , and the 8th best death rate . 
  `` over those 11 minutes or more he was fighting for breath , and i could see both of his fists were clenched the entire time , '' wrote father lawrence hummer , the catholic priest who gave mcguire his last rites and witnessed the execution . 
  `` there is no question in my mind that dennis mcguire suffered greatly over many minutes . '' - and his victims did n't ? 
  * let the downvote frenzy begin *, 
  in fairness , total medals is more rational . 
  are they also going to be sending yarosh and the other militant opposition leaders to the hague ? 
  or did the dozen or so policemen who died in the riots shoot themselves ? 
  [ no ] ( http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/nationality/crimea ) . 
  `` quite a large percentage '' = 12 % . 
  i support this , the more the west spits on russia 's face , the greater will be the stimulus for russia to consolidate itself and ally itself with china , the wave of the future . 
  fuck europe . 
  russia 's future is eurasia . 
  probably not . 
  yeltsin had balls , even if he was a stupid alcoholic . 
  yet another reason to support belarus . 
  if europe wishes to give its breiviks free five-star accomodations for 20 years , more power to them . 
  normal countries do n't understand this and do n't need it . 
  here is [ a graph ] ( http://akarlin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/industrialized-transition.png ) showing the resounding failures of belorussian dictatorship against the unparalleled successes of ukrainian democracy . 
  how could ordinary normal people possibly support lukashenko ? 
  so the russian liberal 's criterion for truth is for three `` serious '' people to claim it as such ? 
  thanks for the info !, 
  think of all the conspiracy theories that are now qed ` ed !, 
  iraqi wmd 's really are real , who could have imagined ? 
  russia attacked georgia first !, 
  global warming is a fraud , and the kyoto protocols are a conspiracy to undermine russia !, 
  ( because illarianov says so ) . 
  also , please stop putting words into my mouth . 
  i am not asking you to stop speaking , but to stop speaking in the names of `` russians '' ( of which you and your ilk are a vanishingly small subgroup ) . 
  russia 's productivity lag is all because of putin and has absolutely nothing to do with the legacy of soviet central planning . 
  just look at latvia or georgia , countries that opted for the euro-atlantic choice , and how much more productive than russia they are ... oh wait . 
  seconded . 
  / u/3dom , please stop speaking for `` russians . '', 
  the only ones who think its fascist are you and your gaggle of shenderoviches and illarianovs . 
  they are . 
  [ mighty and majestic ones ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/goldeneagle-nova.jpg ) . 
   democracy and the rule of law would already be well-rooted in ukraine if it were n't for constant , significant russian interference . 
   it would be more like the liberation of france from the nazis in wwii than of the liberation of aghanistan from the taliban in 2003 . 
  there would probably be victory parades and ukrainian women throwing themselves at us soldiers . 
  you have an apt name . 
  only a `` thinktank fairy '' could possibly believe that . 
  [ and the americans are n't ] ( http://www.ukrainebusiness.com.ua/news/11217.html ) ? 
   however , this sort of thing may set a dangerous precedent . 
  let 's imagine these dolphins reproduce like mad , and become essentially `` pests '' by destroying their environment , eating all the other sea-life and ressources . 
  if they have `` human rights '' , we ca n't use pest control against them , although pest control is also a way to protect their species as well , ensuring that they do n't eat all of their own food . 
  was pest control used against human populations when they destroyed their environment ? 
  no , famine took care of that , every few centuries or so .

  ahrar ash-sham is a moderate group for you ? 
  but at this stage i am not surprised in any insane claim of western apologists . 
  [ vice news ] ( https://news.vice.com/article/exclusive-meet-the-syrian-rebel-commander-in-the-besieged-city-of-madaya ) :  the 47-year old former baker never attended university , and , apart from some lessons at the mosque , he has no formal islamic education . 
  ** but he now leads the local branch of ahrar al-sham , perhaps the largest islamist rebel group in the syrian civil war . 
  ** for the past six months , he and his men have been under a brutal hezbollah siege in the syrian city of madaya , located about 28 miles northwest of damascus . 
   now surrounded by his mercenaries and hizbollah , all approaches mined , people starving . 
  ah-ha-ha , dirty assad mercenaries against brave rebel freedom fighters . 
  too bad assad is supported by majority of syrians , unlike your bearded sunni jihadi friends . 
   weathering hizbollah attacks and putin 's recreation of guernica must seem preferable to assad taking his revenge . 
  you forgot to compare it with holocaust . 
  of course , you do n't care that 1.5 million of aleppo citizens that live in assad-controlled territory under `` rebel '' shelling , you do n't care about any warcrime or massacre committed by the rebels , you do n't care that the `` rebels '' from aleppo attack not only gov-controlled territories , but also kurd-controlled area in sheikh maqsood . 
  you do n't care about anything that does n't fit to your worldview , just retelling black-white propaganda against ebul russians . 
  state-funded deutsche welle in russian exists . 
  and of course it has pretty clear agenda . 
  i would not call it `` propaganda '' , though . 
  for example , their interviews with poroshenko and klimkin went viral among pro-russians , because the interviewer asked tough questions , and ukrainian functionaries looked weak . 
  but still -- they have agenda . 
  they certainly dislike competitors . 
  it 's blatantly anti-russian . 
  they sacked top journalist babitsky , who worked on rfe/rl since the soviet union , when he supported self-determination of crimeans and tried to report on warcrimes of ukrainian paramilitaries . 
  how is it different from voice of america or rfe/rl ? 
  i can read rfe/rl in russian and i can tell you it 's pretty much blatant propaganda . 
  what a bunch of inane bullshit . 
  that 's exactly what russia does in syria . 
  russia does n't fight kurds or moderate groups like southern front . 
  point on the map these `` non-fundamentalist rebel groups '' bombed by russia . 
  which cities they do control ? 
   they are there to make sure their puppet stays . 
  aww , `` peaceful protesters '' narrative again . 
  assad has majority popular support . 
  why should he step down because of demands of \\* violent \\* rioters ? 
  he had every right to crack down on `` protests '' , and you sorta has to use violence when `` protesters '' start to set buildings on fire and kill police officers . 
   like the kurds ? 
  russia does n't bomb the kurds . 
  quite the opposite , the kurds are being shelled by us-supported aleppo moderate head-choppers . 
  google sheikh maqsood shellings -- entirely ignored by the most honest and impartial western media . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ypg%e2%80%93fsa_relations#clashes_with_other_fsa_groups_in_aleppo_.28november_2015_.e2.80.93_present.29  and russia is not cleaning up . 
  it is targeting doctors without borders facilities and causing a massive humanitarian crisis . 
  so it was russia who created `` a massive humanitarian crisis '' . 
  good to know . 
  why `` in general '' ? 
  french motivation is entirely inside of scope of this topic . 
  france [ funded these moderate terrorists ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/07/france-funding-syrian-rebels ) to change regime in sovereign country without un permission . 
  they helped to turn this conflict in the huge bloodbath it currently is . 
  france is not some neutral third party , they are knee-deep in blood of syrian people . 
  so may they gently shut the fuck up , when we are cleaning up the shit after them ? 
  the only irrelevant thing here is french blabbering . 
  rules should be same for everyone , or they are not really rules . 
  video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v71cjf_9ekg the dress was demonstrated as part of forum `` geopolitical challenges of modern time and spiritual mission of vladimir putin '' ( [ link ] ( http://www.forsmi.ru/announce/350030/ ) ) organized by bahrain 's embassy in putin 's birthday . 
  this dress `` face of tsar '' was designed by [ mona al mansouri ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mona_al_mansouri ) . 
  if `` peaceful protesters '' respond to violence with violence , it 's not a peaceful protest anymore . 
  it 's a riot or uprising . 
  and every non-failed government , any authorities will try to forcefully suppress it . 
  of course , assad is a brutal dictator , no doubt about it , i do n't argue against it -- but i do n't trust this `` peaceful protest '' narrative . 
  it 's a fact that hundreds of syrian police officers were killed in first few months of unrest/protest/uprising phase , and it was barely mentioned in the western media . 
  assad used excessive force and gunned down protesters . 
  sure . 
  but looking around i see countries like [ nigeria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/killing_of_pro-biafra_protesters_ ( 2015-2016 \\ ) ) or [ ethiopia ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36546917 ) that kill protesters at factory scale , but it seems nobody really care about them . 
  while in case of syria the us went full mad , `` assad should go '' and so on . 
  peaceful protests . 
  i have heard about these [ `` peaceful protesters '' already somewhere ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm1nkqspsvm ) . 
  do you realize that these `` peaceful protesters '' set on fire several buildings ? 
   20 march , president assad sent a delegation to offer condolences to the families of those killed in the clashes in daraa . 
  [ 29 ] thousands gathered in and around the omari mosque in daraa , chanting their demands : release of political prisoners , abolition of emergency law , and : `` no fear after today '' . 
  [ 29 ] [ 30 ] as the protests heated , the police sprayed tear gas , further angering the protesters who started tearing down a poster of assad ; then the police opened fire into the crowd , witnesses said . 
  [ 29 ]  protesters then burned the local ba'ath party headquarters , the town 's main courthouse and a branch of the syriatel phone company owned by rami makhlouf , a cousin of president assad , a symbol of corruption for the anti-government protesters and considered syria 's richest businessman . 
  [ 22 ] [ 29 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] on the same day , ** seven police officers and four demonstrators were killed in daraa . 
  ** [ 22 ] if the protesters were so peaceful , how these 7 police were killed ? 
  did they shot themselves ? 
  misconduct ? 
  10 spetsnaz soldiers were killed during the storm , including three commanders of storming groups -- two lieutenant-colonels and one mayor . 
  those were the largest special forces casualties in the russian history in a single operation . 
  they had to go in attack even without bullet-proof vests , because the terrorists suddenly started to kill hostages . 
  these people are heroes . 
   russia and assad are bombing hospitals , this is a war crime [ hmm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kunduz_hospital_airstrike ) :  a final report , released 29 april 2016 , reaffirmed the incident as an accident , and said it thus did not amount to a war crime . 
  [ 57 ] sixteen members of the u.s. military were disciplined as a result of the investigation , though none were criminally charged . 
  you forgot a little thing . 
  evidence that russia ** intentionally ** bombs hospitals . 
  because hospitals get bombed for a lot of reasons like in every bombing campaign everywhere . 
  and comparison with other bombing campaigns does n't show that russian bombing is any different in terms of civilian casualties . 
  there would be much higher casualties among civilians would they be really deliberately targeted . 
  i see you are trying to say something . 
  go on . 
  what ? 
  well , i just copied that from wikipedia . 
  it clearly attributes the claim to serbian sources ( obviously biased ) . 
  ok , i edited it out . 
  but my point was that in the end we have 1000 killed combatants and 500 killed civilians , that 's 1/2 ratio -- the same as in this case , if the `` sohr '' numbers are correct . 
  i know that feel . 
  when you accidentally walk out of your cozy echo-chamber and meet with opinions you do n't agree with . 
  how so ? 
  france never called up to for similar investigation against the us or other countries . 
  and i strongly doubt that if e.g. 
  the north korea would blame the us for human right violations ( well , they do it all the time , just read rodong sinmun ) , people would seriously discuss their accusations . 
  russia is not perfect , i do n't know how you get that from my words . 
  neither is the us pure evil , i did n't claim it either . 
  the us greatly helped the kurds in their offensive against isis and so on . 
  maybe they honestly believe they do the right thing and promote democracy ( tm ) , helping the rebels , i do n't know . 
  but in fact they are helping extremists ( see the brave new world of idlib ) and fucking up this poor country . 
  compromise and agreement with russia is certainly possible .
