  however , with that said , three recent pieces of news : * you can now see / r/europe 's traffic stats [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/about/traffic/ ) . 
  * thanks to some of your suggestions , starting next week we are introducing two new weekly series . 
  the first one , round table , is a weekly poll and serious discussion on a relevent topic of interest . 
  the polls will always be very short , just asking for nationality and your stance on the topic at hand . 
  but more importantly , while the discussion is happening , the poll 's results will always be viewable and hopefully this will add some flair to the discussion . 
  this thread will run every monday , and the first topic will be scotland 's independence . 
  topics are chosen by users in / r/europe 's irc channel ( information in the sidebar ) . 
  * the second one , melting pot friday , is silly and just for fun . 
  posted every friday , it 's a light-hearted and general discussion thread where you are encouraged to post in your native tongue . 
  for those of you studying another language , it could be a good way to practice what you know !, 
  thanks once again to everyone who participated !, 
  greetings , and welcome to the first ever / r/europe round table !, 
  every monday , a new topic of interest is debated and discussed in detail . 
  while this is happening , users can vote in a very short poll about that topic . 
  the polls remain open for about a week , and close shortly before the next round table topic . 
  all results are live , and viewable at any time . 
  the idea is to paint the community 's opinion on a particular topic . 
  if the discourse in the thread changes your mind about something , it 's encouraged that you update your thoughts accordingly on the poll . 
  while the goal is to see what the community thinks , it 's also a great opportunity to learn . 
  topics are selected by the good folks over in / r/europe 's irc channel ( information in the sidebar ) . 
  if you have an idea for a topic , feel free to drop by and let us know !, 
  this week 's topic is scotland 's independence .

  welcome to the first melting pot friday !, 
  a fun and silly weekly thread . 
  every friday , we post in our native tongues or in any other language that is n't english . 
  there is no overall topic , so feel free to talk about whatever you want !, 
  it 's also a pretty good opportunity to see how well you know another language . 
  and if you only know english , well , then i suppose that 's what you 'll have to use . 
  this week 's round table topic , as chosen by the irc users of #europe , will be eu foreign policy regarding israel . 
  if you have an idea for a topic next week , feel free to drop by and let us know !, 
  if you are new to the round table , every monday we discuss a relevant and interesting topic , while also polling the users of / r/europe for their opinion . 
  the idea is to paint the community 's opinion on a particular topic . 
  if the discourse in the thread changes your mind about something , it 's encouraged that you update your thoughts accordingly on the poll . 
  while the goal is to see what the community thinks , it 's also a great opportunity to learn . 
  ** most recent piece of news : ** * [ israel blocks eu aid to west bank palestinians ] ( http://www.voanews.com/content/reuters-israel-blocks-eu-aid-to-west-bank-palestinians/1710759.html ) [ take the poll ] ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1geo9lke_paendy1_oobi4c4g84mit7urqnikbumaytw/viewform ) | [ view results ] ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1geo9lke_paendy1_oobi4c4g84mit7urqnikbumaytw/viewanalytics ) | [ csv ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0aper9ltkdyh-ddhnvmnsvwxavg1wtwfydvcxohbhugc#gid=0 ), 
  same rules like last time . 
  talk about whatever you want using any language you want ... although a language other than english is encouraged . 
  hello , and welcome to this week 's round table !, 
  this week , as chosen by you , the uk and its ban on online porn . 
  recently , prime minister david cameron has come under fire for his stance on online pornography . 
  the majority of uk-based isps that provide internet access to almost 90 % of uk homes , have agreed on having `` family-friendly '' internet filters . 
  when asked for his reasoning , he was quoted saying , `` this is , quite simply , about how we protect children and their innocence . '', 
  he further went on to say , `` put simply -- what you ca n't get in a shop , you will no longer be able to get online . '', 
  the filters , while optional , still have privacy-oriented groups such as the org ( open rights group ) worried . 
  in addition to the filters , it will be illegal to possess rape porn , and according to the org , the filters will [ likely be extended to include ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/29/uk-internet-filter-block-more-than-porn_n_3670771.html ) `` violent material '' , `` extremist and terrorist related content '' , `` anorexia and eating disorder websites , '' and `` suicide related websites . '', 
  websites that mention alcohol or smoking , and other esoteric material will also be censored . 
  whether or not you live in the uk , is this something to be concerned about ? 
  is this the start of a heavily government-controlled internet , or are we just being paranoid ? 
  after all , apparently this will all have an off switch .

  welcome to another melting pot friday !, 
  same rules like last time -- talk about whatever you want in whatever language you want ( although something other than english is preferred ) . 
  it 's that time of week again !, 
  where we pretend you 're on your country 's subreddit , and not on / r/europe by only posting in your native tongue . 
  ... and if english is all you know , well , that 'll have to do . 
  while discussions are usually free-form ( they 'll stay that way ) , this week if you have a * funny commercial * to share , please do !, 
  it 's that time of week again , where nobody uses english and the thread reads like someone nuked the tower of babel . 
  it 's melting pot friday !, 
  same rules like last time , you 're encouraged to post in your native tongue * but * if english is all you know , it 'll have to do . 
  every week we try to have a theme . 
  you do n't have to talk about it , but if you do n't know what else to say , it could be a good start . 
  last week 's was funny commercials , ** this week it 's jokes ** . 
  looking forward to some really good ones . 
   have fun !, 
  it 's that time of week again , where nobody uses english and the thread reads like someone nuked the tower of babel . 
  it 's melting pot friday !, 
  same rules like last time , you 're encouraged to post in your native tongue but if english is all you know , it 'll have to do . 
  this week 's theme is all about ** cursing ** . 
  so , get out there and give me your country 's worst . 
  ^ ^ ^ alternative ^ ^ ^ theme ^ ^ ^ title : ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ serbian ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ romanian ^ ^ ^ language . 
  it 's that time of week again , where nobody uses english and the thread reads like someone nuked the tower of babel . 
  it 's melting pot friday !, 
  same rules like last time , you 're encouraged to post in your native tongue but if english is all you know , it 'll have to do . 
  this week 's theme , is ** music ** !, 
  so , share the best of what your country has to offer . 
   it would be nice if we could avoid anything that 's sung in english ( unless you 're british ) . 
  so anything from traditional songs everybody in your country knows , to some obscure pop song you love is game !, 
  ( note : i 'm also going to make a request due to the nature of this particular topic : if you see that someone with your country 's flair already posted a song , hit reply instead of posting normally . 
  this way we can group languages , and it 'll make things easier to browse . 
  you do n't have to follow this , but it would make everyone 's life a lot easier . ), 
  it 's that time of week again , where nobody uses english and the thread reads like someone nuked the tower of babel . 
  it 's melting pot friday !, 
  same rules like last time , you 're encouraged to post in your native tongue , but feel free to use english too . 
  this week 's theme , is ** movies/films from your country !, 
  ** due to the nature of this particular topic , try not to recommend something for which you know * no subtitles * exist . 
  if you 're not sure , a cursory glance at any online subtitle database will give you an idea . 
  contest mode is enabled for this topic , so everyone 's recommendations get equal exposure . 
  ( side note : i 've been receiving a few pms with people liking the one country per top-level comment , so while it 's not enforced , if you could follow that , it would be great . 
  * a whole bunch * of you also complained about american top-level comments `` sharing '' their culture , and i 'm inclined to agree to an extent . 
  reddit is american and we 're all exposed to american culture on a regular basis . 
  this series is supposed to be a nice break from all that while learning something about our fellow neighbours . 
  with that said , it would be appreciated if our american friends could be a little more mindful of this fact . 
  if i get more pms or it becomes a huge issue , then barring a huge backlash , i will be removing top-level american comments in all future threads . ), 
  cheers !, 
  it 's that time of week again , where nobody uses english and the thread reads like someone nuked the tower of babel . 
  it 's melting pot friday !, 
  same rules like last time : it 's * strongly encouraged * to post in your native tongue but if english is all you know , it 'll have to do . 
  this week 's theme is ** shit your countrymen say ** . 
  whether good , bad , or just downright hilarious , share some of your country 's more common sentiments !,

  there are also many , many pictures and caricatures ridiculing the government . 
  really , i do n't understand what it is that you want . 
  do you want hungarian newspapers to show the government eating shit , with a huge title `` they all suck cock lol '' , to believe that criticism of the government is possible and allowed ? 
   but the police are being instructed to arrest everyone doing it and accusing them of sleeping on the streets . 
  you 're making the hungarian police look like the gestapo , but the truth is the homeless people still continue to sleep in the metro stations , even now when it has been made illegal . 
  i do n't really understand how you imagine hungary , do you think homeless people are hiding in dark corners scared that the ss will discover them ? 
  or that they 're forced to sleep in the snow ? 
  the hungarian police is so lenient they 're even being made fun of that they 're cowards . 
   the constinutional court can give opinions - but not being able to reject constiutional laws is the exact definition of a non-democracy that has nothing to do with democracy , you 're confusing it with the rule of law . 
  the constitutional court 's job is to interpret * laws * and see if they are allowed under the current constitution . 
  it 's not their job to interpret the constitution itself . 
  the role of the constitutional court might be different in romania , but i do n't see why that would matter . 
  in the us the constitutional court can not change the constitution , so are you saying the us is a dictatorship ? 
  i could answer you but from experience i know that i 'll get downvoted . 
  / r/europe hates the current hungarian government and does n't care when lies are posted . 
  it 's not illegal to beg on the streets , it 's illegal to sleep there . 
  this was invented because some homeless people do n't want to go to shelters , they 'd rather sleep in the metro stations and shit and piss on the staircases , spreading disease , attacking little children , and i swear that i 'm not making this up . 
  press is not limited 3 . 
  constitutional court may indeed give opinion about laws , it may only not reject constitutional laws . 
  they need to derive their opinion of laws based on the active constitution , not change the constitution itself as they like ( which is what they have been doing , rejecting its articles one by one in the past year ) . 
  there 's a populist/nationalist party in the parliament and sometimes they like to make lists of jews or call roma people animals ... these are not the same people who constitute the government . 
  we also ca n't just ban them from saying what they want in the parliament . 
  you 'll agree that brain surgery is harder than history , so not all studies are equally hard , not all professions are equally valuable . 
  on the other hand , there are many who finish comp.sci . 
  and end up being testers because they ca n't write a line of decent code . 
  u jelly ? 
   they 're essentially unskilled , unsuitable for any other sort of work apart from football . 
  that goes the same for most sportsmen yet they do n't get money thrown at them the same way footballers do . 
  i 've recently been at a presentation of an athlete that won a gold medal at the olympics , besides 6 hours of intensive training he also goes to school . 
  also if the protests are spontaneous ( is n't reported ) but are n't causing much trouble , then the police wo n't interfere . 
  `` birka '' means sheep in hungarian . 
  i read that as `` sheep girl was probably not swedish '', 
  listen to the fucking radio & stfu, 
  i see , trust not what you hear but trust what the article says ? 
  i wonder when will foreigners be able to buy lang in croatia . 
  there are all these tiny islands that swedish old people are dying to die on . 
  yeah that 's what real burek looks like . 
  no offense but i never liked the [ bosnian burek ] ( http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4932411800_437d6cb35a.jpg ) , it has a fake taste . 
  my favorite contemporary one is `` no greek that is of bad idea ''  ), 
  tell us more about what you think of sweden , it always lights up my day , 
  wait , i do n't get it ... if klubradio is banned , then why the fuck can i listen to them on the 95,3 frequency ? 
  is it somehow possible that the article you 're linking is not true ? 
  or perhaps my ears are lying to me ? 
  here , this website lets you listen to various radio stations including klubradio , i wonder if you will hear a sound too or maybe it 's just my imagination : http://tunein.com/radio/klub-radio-953-s15873/ i bet it was too hard to type `` klubradio '' into google and find this link yourself ... better post some shitty article and believe everything it says , than check for the truth on your own . 
  p.s : fuck you downvoters !, 
  before downvoting why do n't you check the facts ? 
  which radio stations are not allowed to broadcast 24/7 ? 
  you learn something new every day . 
  time to delete my posts then ... 
  it 's sensational how they 're lying to their children . 
  i 'd really like to know which radio station has been banned from broadcasting because they were anti-government . 
  surely the german public tv is not teaching the german children to spread lies without checking facts first ? 
  you guys should take 100 % of the money that milosevic and his family stole from serbia and deposited in cyprus banks . 
  it 's estimated it might be up to $ 2 billion . 
  should give you a nice start towards repaying your debt , and hopefully milosevic 's family will starve to death . 
  what do you think a yemeni tourist needs when he wants to visit the friendly paradise of eu ? 
  not just a visa and letter of invitation , but proof of funds , proof of no criminal background , etc. 
  yep , just ask the slovaks how they feel about hungarian signs . 
  that 's the eu for you . 
  awesome , let 's push today 's problems onto our children , just like how our parents did . 
  there 's a greek downvote brigade working on this subreddit , i 've noticed this some time ago . 
  if you criticize anything that 's greek , prepare to have -10 posts . 
  if the greek guy makes fun of your nation , he 'll get +10 . 
  too bad reddit karma wo n't unmake the catastrophic mismanagement of their economy . 
  how would it destabilize anything ? 
  is n't their economy something like 0,5 % of the total eu ? 
  right , so even assuming a 7 % loan , they could 've avoided that if they implemented austerity 3 years ago . 
  reduce the average salary by 7 % for example . 
  their competitiveness would increase and even if it did n't they would n't be piling on debt . 
  it 's win-win . 
  and now we 're here and today they need to give up 10 % on average anyway , which they could 've done before , so what they have done is they 've just postponed the decision . 
  they were living beyond their means , and now when it 's reality time they 're throwing a tantrum . 
  in the end , they will have to face with the consequences of their shortsightedness . 
  i refer to the fact that their debt ratio increased from 40 % to 70 % in 3 years . 
  i do n't know what the interest rate on those previous loans are but i 'm guessing it 's less than 5 % ? 
  life is a struggle , not a fucking dream . 
  get a job , hippy . 
  is that a good response ? 
   i do n't believe that rats are part of the icelandic cousine , either . 
  iceland 's population density is 37 times lower than cyprus ' . 
  but i agree , they wo n't starve , they 'll just move to germany in search for work . 
   if no other plan is proposed by the eu-imf , yes , they are pretty much forced to go down this road . 
  as far as i understood , the eu only wanted the cypriots to find 5 billion `` anyway they like '' , and left it to the cypriots to handle the details . 
  the cyprus pm wanted everyone to share the burden , not just the rich people . 
  it 's ridiculous to blame this proposal on the eu-imf , or saying that this is against the spirit of the eurozone , when the cypriots came up with the plan . 
  no one forced them to do this , they could 've just taxed the rich 75 % like the french did . 
  that is to say , of course there are other plans . 
  some people will have to pay , it 's up to the cypriots to decide how to balance the burden . 
  i personally favor an egalitarian approach , but from / r/europe 's history i 'm sure this is unpopular and instead most people think the rich should pay more . 
  the cypriots themselves most certainly do think so . 
  cypriots . 
  lol ur so funny . 
  at least those prostitutes work for their living , not borrowing other people 's money and then throwing a tantrum when they need to pay back . 
  why should i worry because they 're doing legal work in the nl ? 
  i agree with you 110 % . 
  it 's their decision , and their responsibility . 
  they decided that they wo n't make the sacrifice to bail out their own country . 
  now they 're responsible for the consequences of this decision . 
  i think that rejecting this plan will lead to one of the following : 1 . they go bankrupt 2 . they accept the plan a few weeks from now if they do go bankrupt and are forced to eat rats , i just want everyone to realize that this is what they democratically wanted . 
  no one forced them to go down this road .

  all minorities can get education in their native language . 
  unlike kosovo albanians , these minorities consider serbia their home and do n't have separatist tendencies . 
   the legal requirement is so high to ensure that only the truly guilty , ie beyond doubt , are given hadd punishments . 
  i believe in the ottoman empire hadd punishment was rarely given out . 
  there is some what sensible reasoning behind it , but it is seriously flawed as we often see here . 
  it is very flawed , but unfortunately it 's impossible to make a system that would completely eliminate false rape accusations . 
  western system is seriously flawed as well , you can end up losing your friends , family , career and reputation because of a false rape accusation . 
   but we all know rape of a male is rarely reported , even in the west , so i 'd be surprised if it has ever happened in a sharia run state . 
  there are a lot of cases of men raping men in the middle east , especially locals raping asians . 
  but those cases remain unreported because victims would be punished for being homosexuals , while perpetrator wo n't face any prosecution . 
  saudis have to drive all the way to bahrain just to get wasted . 
  yeah . 
  football stopped being sport long ago , now it 's just pure business and nothing else . 
   i do n't get why many european women go to arab countries to work as prostitutes . 
  money . 
  a lot of easy money . 
  but what happens if a woman who is a rape victim is n't an infidel ? 
  i think i 've read somewhere that you can be locked up for saying `` hi '' to a woman in the street if she reports it to sharia police . 
  it 's impossible to find a ride from balkans to any baltic state except in july and august , when people from russia and belarus are traveling to/from bulgarian coast . 
  nah , it was only a hypotetical question . 
  i 'd like to present you a hypothetical situation and i 'd be happy if you could take time and give a honest reply . 
  let 's say your so wants to marry you . 
  you love him , you love his personality and his personal qualities . 
  his material situation is like this : he lives with his parents in a big house in suburbs , built in 70s . 
  his parents live on the ground level , and he wants you and future kids to live on the 1st floor . 
  he has university degree , a decent job , which is n't paying much , but is pretty stable , works 40 hours per week and has no debt . 
  he owns a used car from late 90s/early 2000s . 
  he can not afford going anywhere for winter vacation , but can afford 7 days of summer vacation every or every other year . 
  he buys clothes mainly on discounts and second hand shops . 
  all he 's expecting from you is to take care of household and kids , and maybe do some part time or temporary job if such opportunity comes along . 
  with the situation presented , would you accept your so 's proposal ? 
  huge mountains can help ( i guess ? 
   worst thing is most people go `` so what if the majority is kurdish ? 
  we just need to get along : dddd '' yeah , getting along with an ethnic group that * does not want * to get along is a bit tough . 
  \u0160e\u0161elj will fortunately never come to power . 
  he is respected because he managed to beat hague tribunal , but majority of people are tired of his pro-war rhetoric and would be happy if he could just retire and never hold a microphone in his hand again . 
  damn . 
  that 's a disaster waiting to happen . 
  we had the same thing in kosovo . 
  in 1948 . there were 733.000 people living in kosovo , and in 1989 . there were 1.889.000 . 
  serbian families had 2 , sometimes 3 kids at most , while albanians had 6 - 7 and more . 
  looks like kurds are applying the same tactic in turkey . 
  at least . 
  serbia will never enter eu without recognizing kosovo first , and imposing sanctions on russian federation . 
  pro-eu politicians here ( especially the ruling party ) are silent about it , because they are using eu accession as a distraction from real issues . 
   i do n't really see how would croatia and serbia go to war currently , and over what . 
  there 's still an ongoing border dispute . 
  but it would be an incredibly stupid reason for any kind of armed conflict if you ask me . 
  big and diverse unions do n't work . 
  they fall apart sooner or later . 
  soviet union fell apart . 
  yugoslavia fell apart . 
  that 's because nationalism prevails . 
  further federalization of eu would lead to collapse . 
  even with current situation in eu , a lot of countries are dissatisfied . 
  a lot of stuff does n't work . 
  brexit , migrant quotas and fences are result . 
  i think that eu is unsustainable in this form . 
  it will have to either transform or it will collapse . 
  violent revolutions are not a solution for anything . 
  we had our maidan back in 2000 , got pro-eu government , politicians filled their own pockets and regular people got nothing . 
  muslims do not want to assimilate . 
  there 's no way you can save the system . 
  enjoy the decline . 
  whenever i 'm asked if i still live with parents , i reply that parents still live with me . 
   you do n't go to greece to stay 2 weeks on a beach or to get some cheap booze . 
  i do . 
  deep web ? 
  here in serbia 3 years is minimum sentence for any amount of weed . 
  how about in christiania ? 
   it 's not doomsday yet , unless you happen to live in the rural regions same problem here . 
  male : female ratio in small towns and villages is crazy . 
  once girls finish school , they move to belgrade in order to study/get a job/marry and you do n't see them ever again . 
  guys on the other hand tend to stay in their hometown and live with parents , thus creating this huge gender imbalance . 
  wow , that 's super weird . 
  i do n't know anyone here with that kind of problem , is it common in croatia ? 
   when it comes to internet, 
  how 's that possible ? 
  your native language is not croatian ? 
  same thing here for latin diacritics . 
  serbian keyboards are qwertz but most of the keyboards that are sold are qwerty . 
  so people type s , c , dj , z instead of \u0161 , \u0107 , \u010d , \u0111 , \u017e . 
  especially in sms . 
  you had to google it ? 
  someone 's got ta do it . 
  i do n't think so . 
  commieblocks . 
  sure , you need some initial funds , but that 's far from any significant amount . 
  studies are free with eu passport , you need to pay dorm though , but you can work and study at the same time and make yourself self-sufficient . 
   you can apply for romanian passport and go clean toilets in germany with romanian passport or enroll university in any eu country and get a decent job after graduation . 
   what i 'm trying to say is that serbian government never gave a shit about kosovo , before or after the 1999 war kosovo was receiving huge amounts of money during the time of sfr yugoslavia , which accepted a lot of immigrants from albania and people in kosovo never paid any utilities or taxes . 
  fertility was highest in europe . 
  and even during the time of tito , more than 10.000 serbs were leaving kosovo permanently every year since tito did everything against serb interests . 
  1974 . constitution is one of many things he did against serbs . 
  during 90s , milo\u0161evi\u0107 conducted some extreme measures to fix things , which eventually made situation for kosovo serbs even worse . 
  after milo\u0161evi\u0107 , all governments in belgrade were brussels puppets that do what brussels says . 
  but what they have in common is they do n't care much about kosovo serbs . 
  almost every serb family in kosovo now has a house or apartment in central serbia , in case shit hits the fan like in 2004 . 
  they know there 's no one to rely on but on themselves . 
  how old was his mother ?

  because they do n't give up . 
  the skill difference it very noticeable , english player control the ball a lot better , but when an icelandic player gets passed he runs back to try and get the ball again . 
  over and over again . 
  iceland had 6-7 players in attack and 10 players in defence because they ran . 
  they ran and did n't give up . 
  got latest ep spoiler, 
  that i know of , yes . 
  each phoneme/sound has a corresponding letter in the alphabet and there are n't prolongued/differently accented/very similar phonemes . 
  so you learn what sounds there are , learn which letter corresponds to each sound ( 30 sounds , 30 letters ) and you 're ready to write . 
  you hear a word with 6 sounds , you take your pen and write them in the order . 
  same goes for reading - you see the letters written and just pronounce sounds . 
  2 letters cant make 1 sound ( example : english meet has 4 letters , yet 3 sounds . ), 
  kids as young as 1-2 grade can write and read 95 % of the words i think . 
  i think german is easier for slavic and germanic speakers , but french should be easier for romance speakers . 
  german being easier for slavic speakers is arguable though , but i think phonemes , accenting and grammar of german is closer than the french one, 
  yes but neither it is a romance language, 
  it 's not really similar to any of the slavic languages though  . , 
  i nominate serbian as it has the best/easiest spelling system of european languages !, 
  unlike the one in turkey only water had been spilled in belgrade . 
  i am not talking about citizenship , im talking about acceptance into their ethnicity and culture . 
  in the usa you can learn good english , learn about their history live for a while and call yourself an american . 
  british ppl have shown its not the same case in the uk, 
  would you wan na live in a country whose citizens only tolerate you because of your education and would banish you in any other case scenario ? 
  and how would you feel if people around the eu had started talking about banishing the british people as soon as the results appeared on 24th ? 
  i personally dont care really , as ive never intended to even visit the uk , i dont know anyone that has migrated to the uk and as there are barely a few serbs living there , but to me it seems that brits want the best of the 2 worlds and i dont think thats possible . 
  well i 'm of an opinion the circumstances have changed . 
  in the last century the economy was booming , so all the immigrants could 've been employed and that enabled them to integrate quickly . 
  now during the economic crisis not even the citizens have high employment so immigration becomes more noticeable . 
  i could be wrong though , not really familiar with post 2000 immigration to be honest . 
  started by acussations of brain damage ended up with an agreement on a portion of an argument . 
  hope brexit ends up at least similarly, 
  actually a lot of ppl from europe immigrated during the 20 century too . 
  thats why the usa emerged to be a superpower after ww2 . 
  post war booming economy paired with additional work force empowered their position . 
  almost all of the ppl of balkan descent and most of the polish and russian descent migrated during 1950-1990, 
  shouldve pointed out i was refering to 20 century immigration, 
  welfare system does tend to attract poor people with no education , true , but animosity from the local population will deter the educated immigrants . 
  im not experienced with immgrating , to be honest , but i do know i wouldnt wan na live in a country i was n't welcome in . 
  that 's why i jumped the gun and drew a paralel between the usa and uk because the former one built itself by warmly accepting immigrants and integrated them into society . 
  you 're right , no need to be rude , i 'm sorry . 
  was just in a league of legends game so my attitude transfered from there . 
  anyway i refered to the usa immigration during the 20th century which brought them where they currently are . 
  are you that braindead to understand ? 
  no doctor/engineer/programmer / chemist of polish/romanian/pakistani / indian/arabian descent would want to live in a country where his countrymen were banished from knowing the only reason he 's accepted because of his level of education . 
  learn something from the usa system , there 's a reason they 're a world power and the uk is n't . 
  the ironic thing is those people who keep demanding that immigrants get deported are in a lot of the cases less educated than the people they wanted deported . 
  way to dig your own grave, 
  umm i do n't understand your post ? 
  are you 13 ? 
   russia commentates on something `` oh boy they 're spreading the propaganda again ''  russia does n't say shit `` oh they 're silent so they do n't make voters vote against the result they would want '' you have an issue man, 
  you kinda did a 180 degrees in that argument by starting claiming i ` ts most viewed in russia and ended up bingoing his point it 's most viewed in england as it 's in english lol ... 
  democracy is n't voting on something until you get a result you want or is better for your country . 
  for reference `` ja '' means `` i '' in slavic languages, 
  but there 's a problem with the 52 % majority that has voted to leave the eu . 
  if the uk bowed after the referendum and ended up in an even worse position in the eu there ** will ** be riots and instability in the country . 
  those 52 % were already quite vocal , imagine how would they be after a decision they made by making up the majority was n't respected , and they even ended up more `` tied '' then they were before the referendum . 
  the uk is on a really thin ice and one wrong step could make it break so i hope your politicians do n't fuck up . 
  it was only a prank guys, 
  well i think germany wants the same thing, 
  denmark , finland and sweden ? 
  oh it 's kinda hard to spot sarcasm on the internet . 
  im not talking about your right to commentate on anything , and i in fact encourage it . 
  it 's the `` this is american website yadda yadda '' i have a problem with . 
  who gives a damn who 's site it is . 
  so british people can post shit about american politics and you woulnd ' t be allowed to complain about it because they language you 're using is theirs ? 
  you have to trigger it in under 2 years . 
   this is an american website , get use to it this comment is among the stupidest things you can say . 
  english is an european language yet no one forces you to follow it 's rules of spelling and vocabulary and say `` this is an european language , get used to it . '', 
  too bad considering the ticket for now is 500 usd for both ways : /, 
  i 'm pretty surprised by that map too as i know some danish people , and i 've seen pictures of danish celebrities and i could 've sworn brown - light eyes was about 50-50 . and 28 % seems a bit too low for serbia . 
  green + blue number is close to brown eyes number here based on my observation, 
  umm the colors are only used to differentiate the lang families , not to indicate which of them are close because in that case baltic languages should be colored more similarly to slavic than the uralic ones are . 
  anyway pink ( uralic ) and red ( romance ) are similar colors yet the language families are nothing alike . 
  we have a similar saying that goes :  i vuk sit i ovce na broju which roughly translates to : the wolf is sated and all the sheeps are at count . 
  casualties statistic is n't really reliable when it comes to siegeing a city as the wounded and captured civilians count while the attacking side has no civilians at the battle ground . 
  the legions have been formed around 150ish bce and from then until 3-4 century ad they have numbered between 4000 and 7000 men . 
  if i recall correctly during the times of barbaric invasions in 4-5 century ad number of men in a legion decreased , but legions numbers were increased so they could defend the border more efficiently . 
  after the western empire fell , legions continued to be used in the eastern empire until 6 century . 
  not only have they recognized it to be superior , they based a lot of their culture on the greek one . 
  mythology , myths , clothing , way of life , art , philosophy , science , music , literature , goverment etc. 
  were all either imported or influenced by greece . 
  though romans were inspired by greeks on a lot of subjects , they also improved stuff they ` borrowed ' . 
  roman architecture was influenced by the greek one , but they improved it drastically . 
  same goes for law and military . 
  well played !, 
  if it means anything most serbians are cheering for you and think you can win it . 
  i am not claiming it 's predestined to succeed , i 'm not agreeing with your claim it 's predestined to fail . 
  big difference . 
  neither does your claim two countries will fuck up a cooperation agreement in 2016 . but sure . 
  two can play that game : knowing the history of the usa you guys will have a civil war soon , in which black people will rebel against the white people . 
  in serbian `` sloveni '' are n't slovenians . 
  sloveni are slavic . 
  slovenians are sloven ** c ** i, 
  what do you mean ? 
  south slavic languages are really smooth and generally have gentle accents unlike other slavic languages . 
  he 's so salty about that tax lol, 
   i 'm not sure if you have free press there in serbia no we do n't have printing paper yet . 
  actually we are still living by the tribal system  but there 's something here in the west called `` opinion pieces '' there 's something here called `` kolumna '' which is basically that . 
  i 'm not refering to this post in particular , i 'm refering to the medias publishing misleading data , articles , claims etc to support he `` out '' campaign . 
  this is getting ridiculous .

  mmm , please explain where i denied that army of republika srpska was doing wrong by sieging a city for so long time ? 
  i do n't get why guys like you instantly go full rage when i prove that not only serbia fucked up the balkans . 
  since nato is supposed to be a competent organization were their focus is granting freedom and civil life condition for every one in the world , tell me , how do you explain such competence by using depleted uranium ammunitions on 40 years old bunkers and tanks built in the ' 70 ? 
  cause if you google for like 10 minutes you will be amazed to discover that military equipment that needs to be hit with such ammo 's to be destroyed must be at least being built in the ' 90 . 
  and none of army of republika srpska equipent was that new . 
  ah , last thing , army of republika srpska was completely out of control from serbian government and army during the siege of sarajevo , since radovan karad\u017ei\u0107 and ratko mladi\u0107 went full retard not listening anymore to anyone if not for their mad ideas . 
  so army of republika srpska siege on sarajevo ( where i was born ) is wrong but using depleted uranium ammo without considering the consequences for * fucking decades or centuries * on civil population from radiation contamination was the correct way to resolve the whole situation ? 
  and yes , army of republika srpska in not the only `` army '' involved on sarajevo siege , muslim paratroops and terrorists were also there having fun with population , not to mention foreign mercenary snipers getting paid for every kill shot . 
  serbia ? 
  and what about muslim , croatian and albanian military/paramilitary troops abuse , tortures and genocides ? 
  serbian leaders and military troops who did all these known terrible things they had and have to be judged and sentenced for their crimes . 
  and the same fucking thing must be applied on every other balkan countries/region involved in such things . 
  no , it 's shameful and disrespectful for all dead and suffering civilians ( of every ethnicity , religion , nation ) to justify nato actions on population cause they had to give us some taste of `` freedom '' . 
  but wait , serbia actions in balkan wars have been judged as supreme evil by all media and propaganda from west , so for sure all the things are black and white , am i right reddit ? 
  and what about using depleted uranium ammo 's during air raids against artillery positions around sarajevo ? 
  it 's not nato fault if the rate of leukemia increased over 75 % in children in the town ? 
  also contaminating with radiation every agriculture field and water sources in the mountains around sarajevo . 
  edit : downvotes ? 
  for saying proved facts ? 
  always amazing me r/europe . 
  for fucks sake , reposting a thing not even one week old ? 
  i guess georgian government will accuse russia for training spy lions sent to terrorize the country . 
  sooo the thing that albanian population in kosovo and macedonia is increasing much more than serbian and macedonian has been proved ? 
  the fact is that they do n't pass via border check points , most of them sneaks in the forests and woods , as we know the number of frozen dead people found in serbian mountains had a big increase the past winter . 
  is this dream ? 
  still no one has said serbia !, 
  at least you are better of your fat brother . 
  yes but no . 
  i disagree , giving the whole responsibility for all to milo\u0161evi\u0107 is bullshit . 
  especially if we look at what karad\u017ei\u0107 and mladi\u0107 did not giving a single fuck when milo\u0161evi\u0107 was nearly able to stop the continuation of war after peace meetings in greece . 
  alright , let 's be clear . 
  i hate the nationalism of milo\u0161evi\u0107 , karad\u017ei\u0107 , mladi\u0107 , tu\u0111man , gotovina , izetbegovi\u0107 and all the other guys that destroyed jugoslavija . 
  i do n't have any bad feeling toward princip because he wanted what the majority of people in balkans wanted , freedom . 
  we have been dominated by ottoman empire for centuries and when we had the chance to be free we got dominated by austrian empire . 
   madness nationalism these are your words , these words are accusing serbian government to be mad , to be extreme natiolasist and overall bad . 
  and since now serbian government is not any of these things you should consider to think and inform yourself better instead of writing wrong things . 
  all this because we had nationalism and madness in the past of our country and no one want it anymore . 
  and building one metal statue is the last thing that can ruin serbia even more of how is it now economically/socially . 
  wait i 'm agree with a kebab ? 
  something must be wrong !, 
  my troll detector is off charts !, 
  if you really believe that princip actions lead to wwi you really should start learning history from books and not the internet . 
  discussing ? 
  every time there is a submission about russia or putin the whole comment section goes full retard , people who tries to have a fair discussion are forced to hide how many points has their posts cause they will be downvoted to hell . 
  every . 
  single . 
  time . 
  russia and putin submissions are basically become hate circlejerk , on every manner . 
  jesus christ guys , you really do n't have anything better to do instead of constantly spewing shit on russia and putin every day ? 
  whit such trash articles ? 
  this subreddit its starting to become hilarious . 
  cause putin is the supreme evil mastermind of every bullshit happening around the world , do n't you know that ? 
  honestly i think that isis do n't want in any possible way to poke russia . 
  it can be a country with a lot of problems ( what 's happening in ukraina ) , but when it 's time to deal with terrorists they are just an oiled extermination machine . 
  if some of the leader of isis will have the brilliant idea of doing terror attacks in moscow ( like what happened years ago ) , or to invade russia frienly countries , i bet isis will be deleted from earth . 
  mfw armenia do n't give a fuck being in the middle of major muslim countires . 
  do you want the third balkan wars in 20 years ? 
  because thats how you get third balkan wars . 
  well yeah , beside ww2 . 
  uhm , have you guys wondered for a second that this video has been made in 1990 , in the worst storical period of ussr/russia ? 
  also known as soviet union fall ? 
  where the entire nations went in full anarchy for a lot of time ? 
  do you realize that you folks are just shouting that this was sovietic union from 1917 untill its end ? 
  are you guys serious ? 
  wait what ? 
  i guess i would change all the presidents and prime ministers of serbia , croatia and bosnia from 1989 - 1995 with people with some brain matter and no extreme nationalism ideas . 
  i wonder how much drunk are these journalists to write trash articles like this . 
  i agree , personally i would slap the asses of these terrorists but in reality leave serbia and serbian people outside from this . 
  the only thing that i see there is kebab being pushed back home . 
  it can be !, 
  it 's sorcery !, 
  devil 's work !, 
  heresy !, 
  do n't force me to put away my new pitchfork pls / s, 
  thanks obama . 
  in balkans wars nobody did something wrong . 
  also , thanks clinton and blair for all the uranium in the terrain , water , vegetables , fruits . 
  and this kids , is why our country is a joke . 
  * socialist * for fucks sake . 
  not really . 
  they might have done something but still no very big changes beside the new controversial election law . 
  since the government has no big majority and its formed by various parties ( cause it 's the third non-elected government ) every new law or reform ends being butchered by the demands of every political party . 
  and you forgot the last report tv program where they unveiled all the completely absurds cost of the high speed rail roads , due to the less or more 40 % corruption in all organization to build this immense thing . 
  basically italy has spent 6 to 7 more times per kilometre of rail road compared to every other european country . 
  since r/europe it 's literally a minefield you risk to create another balkan war circlejerk every . 
  single . 
  time . 
  precautions must be taken always here . 
  bois its happening !, 
  kebab is threatening the mighty serbia !, 
  pack up folks , time to restart the party in the balkans / s, 
  i suggest to improve the kidneys market to lower the losses . 
  speaks the one from the country that for almost 500 years drew border of nations using a pencil on map not givinig a single fuck about religions , ethnicity and culture of people . 
  this guy just won the internet . 
  aaand some one compares us to turk genocide of armenians , did n't see that coming . 
  for once is not about balkan nations killing each other , kek . 
  holy shit mongolia !, 
  well , the movie has some of my favorite actors and when it will come out in my country ill go to see it , but andrey chikatilo is something really really important culturally in russia and i would be pissed of too if i would be russian . 
  for example , how do you think us government will react if russia or iran will make a movie about a story of ernest hemingway but it will be completely butchered/distorted from the original ? 
  really r/europe ?

  latin is 3rd foreign you get in ( some ) highschools . 
  i learnt a big deal of it in school school . 
  we start english at age of 6 and by primary schools ending ( age 15 ) i had knowledge of most of the grammar and a wide vocabulary . 
  whatever i needed to learn in highschool i already knew because i started using internet more . 
  more like , no one in serbia that does n't visit reddit has n't heard the song . 
  it 's used for respect purposes . 
  basically here we use the formal speech towards all older people , so in highschool you use formal you to address the teachers , while they use the informal you to address you . 
  and in college we still keep using formal you , but college professors use it back at us and also they use `` colleague '' when addressing you . 
  mutual formal you in college signifies we 're adults now and are being treated as such even by the most educated people in the country while the `` colleague '' thing is to signify professors think of us as academic citizens which they accept and regard as their professional peers . 
  finnish, 
  estonian , sami languages , v\u00f5ro, 
  here we use a formal `` you '' between each others and the word you use to address them is `` professor , '', 
  she looks a bit like olga kuzmina ( which is amazingly c u t e ), 
  bmw - bemve , bembara mercedes - merdza , mecka,

  having looked at a few other of her photos , they seem more blue to me, 
  pernille skipper looks a bit like sansa stark from the game of thrones . 
  schulz is n't even average ... 
  i totally agree with your post , but , is n't that ebba lady a blonde with blue eyes ? 
  lol i always found it weird that people ca n't pronounce words like `` hrv '' where r is a vowel . 
  like , we even have harder stuff i would love to see some of you guys trying to pronounce `` obra\u0161\u010di\u0107 '' ( \u0161 - sh , \u010d - ch , \u0107 - italian ** c ** iao ) , `` kaldrma '' - 4 consonants, 
  it 's quite interesting - hungarian and finnish are even farther relatives than russian and english ( 8000 years vs 4000 ) but the former two retain more grammatical similarities with each other , than the latter two . 
  i actually have no idea . 
  we 've had cable since i can remember, 
  lol we have those sweet pizzas too . 
  hijacking , cause lazy to type . 
  same except for 8.00 or 14.00 start depending on your shift . 
  burek is from turkey tho, 
  it 's not about the dish itself it 's about what 's according to some , the correct way to call it . 
  some people insist that burek is only the thing with minced meat and onions , so according to them , burek with cheese has no sense and instead is called pita with cheese . 
  it 's eh not popular but it 's known . 
  everyone has tried it at some points ( usually at 17-18 ) and never drank it again . 
  most popular mix with wine is sparkling water , with white wine . 
  to me it sounds like someone knowing 10 words is trying to improvise, 
  eh you mean stack overflow ? 
  football , basketball and volleyball, 
  there will never be a correct % of population able to speak fluent english stat . 
  also numbers on that link are overblown for some countries . 
  ~ 12 % for our two right wing , pro russia parties . 
  yup . 
  the worst thing is that unlike in the early 2000s , people here have seemingly given up . 
  back in the early 2000s when the nationalistic regime had fallen people were full of hope and we actually had improvement - now everyone is like meh . 
  i 'm not . 
  i 'm talking about veganism which is a more restrictive form of vegetarianism . 
  vegans are very rare here which does n't come off as surprising because we 're traditionally a very carnivorous country . 
  almost all of our dishes include meat or other animal products . 
  those that are vegans are seen as weird , or pretentious if they talk a lot about it . 
  fifa a bit less because it 's sometimes seen as a thing you do with your buddies when you 're drunk . 
  but games which you play solo in your room are seen as `` you have nothing better to do , eh ? 
  same as in finland , except it applies not only to adults , but to everyone who 's over 16-17 really . 
  feels like being stuck in a limbo, 
  in a way that yours is one of the few that invades other countries in 21 century . 
   although it 's only seems brutally effective when it 's deployed in the sort of `` get there , get rid of the enemy , get out '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vietnam_war, 
   yugos  malcziki ( our version ) oh god make it stop . 
   they wo n't cause it would be ilegal , since they would break the art 1 of the spanish constitution  so was kosovo 's independance declaration :p, 
  there was like 15 years ago . 
  also this guy is a blast : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvez7xadjse https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32mjtu7nof8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmpdzqyq6ki, 
  here we have to take a first aid course , then we have 40 classes of theory about various traffic related shit , then we have to pass the theory test with at least 90 % , afterwards we have 20 hours of practical driving classes with your instructor and then you have to pass the driving test in front of your instructor and a police officer with almost no mistakes . 
  all of that costs around $ 600, 
  so ... what color is it ? 
  so estonian shares about 1/4 of the words ' roots with finnish ? 
  ( assuming they kept those words as well ) also what is the relation between the words with estonian root and their appropriate finnish counterparts ? 
  i maybe do the ` t ' sound , i 'm not quite sure , but i do [ \u00f0 ] and [ \u03b8 ] differently ( most of the time ), 
  also hard gs, 
  yump ( jump ) , yacket ( jacket ) etc. 
  i bring my tongue to my upper front teeth kinda blow and say something that resembles 'd ' . 
  the current version is from 2006 .

   green eyes are quite popular in france good to know , 
  women having fat asses ? 
  - height ( especially for men ) - being fit - being white those are what most of us would agree i guess . 
  hair , eye colors , facial traits etc are different from person to person . 
  hahah it looks like he 's playing with children, 
  serbia is around 183 which is 6 feet . 
  the tallest region i know of is surely south - eastern part of republika srpska . 
  everyone i know from there is 2-3 cm around my height ( 193cm ) this is all about the male height , i 'm not sure about female, 
  your 48 000 town in 2m slovenia is a much bigger fraction than his in 80m germany . 
  indeed, 
  4/5 , not bad, 
  ice hockey is canadian , according to the wikipedia page, 
  basketball, 
  reasons : 1 . 
  young people do n't really understand war and some might even get warm to the ideology 2 . 
  it 's not a good literary work . 
  it simply has no elements which will improve kids ' literature skills . 
  it 's as good as reading a random novel from a book store . 
  pro : 1 . helps kids view the story from the other angle and can bring some critical thinking for them . 
  what 's the point of political correctness ? 
  if someone tells me we need to introduce a dozen more genders and say `` gender is not binary '' i am not gon na agree with them , despite it hurting their feelings and even though they 'd think i hurt their rights . 
  despite you thinking you 're `` gender fluid : changing between male and female '' or you thinking you 're `` dragon-kin '' , a dragon stuck in human body , we 're not adding those to gender lists . 
  there are n't any sjws here . 
  first time i heard about `` kin '' , `` spiritual animals '' , 10 + genders etc. 
  was on reddit , and for a while i thought it was some sort of a joke/meme, 
  geopolitics is a bias thing : if 1 strong guy bullies someone you were about to become friends with you sanction him , if your strong friend bullies some other kid from another school you do n't give a crap . 
  now apply this methaphor, 
  though that 's based on wikipedia page views, 
  yea i do n't doubt you , but around the bombing of serbia there has been a lot of stories about serbia , a big chunk of which were untrue/speculations/taken out of context just to justify the bombings and so your people can say `` destroying their county in 3 months of bombing is fine , they had it coming '' .

they can be hilarious too . 
  today i saw , , ubi baliju da siptar nema avliju '' ( kill a bosniak so that albanian does n't have a backyard . 
  anything that rhymes eh ? 
  favourite : if we exclude montenegro ( serbian moldova ) and macedonia ( child of serbia and bulgaria ) then [ beautiful romania  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/payfabf.jpg ) . 
  i 'm still amazed how we never went to war with you guys . 
  least favourite : hard to pick , but croatia and albania are the top two, 
  hah , you crack up my joyless heart, 
  how much experience did you have with the serbian people ? 
  i suggest you visit serbia and meet them . 
  that 'll probably change your mind, 
  so much romanian love in this thread !, 
  why would you think that ? 
  because croatian army was superior , and their other adversaries were not as weak as the serbian army of krajina ( there are likely even more factors influencing this , warfare is anyting but simple ) . 
  krajina could have stood a chance with the help from srpska or fry , but both of them failed too give any . 
  they were betrayed and sacrificed, 
  i disagree . 
  i think the serbs were to blame for expulsion of croats from krajina , and croats and mpri are to blame for expulsion of serbs from croatia ( krajina as well as other parts of the country ) . 
  the idea is the same i think . 
  both poland and germany had their people inside czechoslovakia 's borders and both percieved it as wrongfu/unjust . 
  they both seized oportunity to take back those lands too . 
  yeah pretty dickish move from all three countries imo . 
  ah and now the eternal question : who was ( has ) the biggest dick ? 
  something to declare , croatia ? 
  i agree . 
  i just wanted to point out , that , when it suits them , great powers will allow or even legalize ethnic cleansing . 
  a more recent example would be expulsion of krajina serbs from croatia . 
  on both sides , serbian and bosniak . 
  it was no genocide , but a massacre of about 8000 bosniaks . 
  prior to that 3300 serbs of srebrenica and surrounding villages were killed, 
   i know that czechoslovakians occupied it i think that nazis said the same thing for sudety . 
  guess you were annexation buddies , briefly . 
  then the same thing happened to you, 
  as someone mentioned in the comments it had been decided on potsdam conference by allies, 
  simpsons are n't dubbed in serbia since they are mostly adolescent/adult oriented , altough kids watch them too . 
  same with south park . 
  only children cartoons and animated movies are dubbed . 
  if the translators are good and do n't translate jokes literrary , they can be pretty awsome and give a unique vibe to a cartoon . 
  sponge bob and tmnt ( 90s version ) are good examples . 
  in my opinion dubbing for younger audiences is ok , but for adolescents and older , well not really . 
  ah , i wrote the comment then saw the edit . 
  clearly not biased at all, 
  no , i mean write ( type , whatever ) your responses in a slavic language you use . 
  bellow write a translation of your response in english, 
  say that in slovakian . 
  in the first three rows i see nothing but squares . 
  angular glagolitic alphabet eh ? 
  this is more or less a known fact but i 'm gon na present it anyway : today the eastern orthodox churches celebrate saint cyril and methodius . 
  cyril did n't create cyrillic but the glagolitic alphabet . 
  cyrillic was created by his disciples saint clement and naum . 
  in old church slavonic the terminology used is different . 
  the glagolitic alphabet is called cyrillic and cyrillic is called climentic, 
  chicago too, 
  :p wazit y u no use slavic languages ? 
  you know at least three of them . 
  what does this one look like :p, 
  let 's try speaking slavic languages when we can understand each other :d, 
  nope , all cyrillic-using slavic countries celebrate it , and probably some non-cyrillic . 
  [ here 's the starting page of the google search in bulgaria today ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/128544/google+with+starting+page+in+cyrillic+for+bulgarian,+slavic+culture+day ), 
  yup , and there is historical basque country further south . 
  this is just the autonomous region . 
  i love editing maps , i can expand it in the morning if you wish . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/906pewk.png ) , have a revised iberia map i made, 
  i absolutely agree, 
  i see myself as serbian first ( national identity ) , then comes my town and province ( subnational ) identity , and after that supranational : european , slavic and balkan . 
  anti-christ ? 
  no , no , no , no you got it all wrong . 
  everyone knows putin is literary hitler, 
  [ gyros ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gyros ) ( or pork kebab if you will ) from greece of course , altough there are fine ones in serbia and in immigrant restaurants across europe, 
   i do n't see anything surprising in the fact that ethnies regrouped after there was a damn war between them ... 
  this was n't willing regruoping , it was in most cases violent forced relocation , in many cases people 's ancestral homes have been burned to the ground , so they have nowhere to come back to . 
   , but what it could do is make it harder for them to kill each other , and it did just that . 
  no it did n't . 
  kfor did nothing to prevent the organized murder , arson and ethnic cleansing in march of 2004 , and on numerous other occasions . 
  yup , just replace pro-russian with anti-russian, 
  have you noticed tons of anti-russian comments which are heavily voted up , which seems awfully suspicious . 
  oh wait , it does n't . 
  this is / r/europe of course, 
  the nato bombing ans subsequent occupation did stop the war , but it did n't stop ethnic conflict . 
  quite the contrary , it accelerated ethnic cleansing . 
  look at the ethnic maps of kosovo [ 1991 ] ( http://www.kosovo.net/ethnicmap_91.jpg ) and [ 2005 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:kosovo_ethnic_2005.png ), 
   you mean the un intervention that put a stop to the ethnic war ? 
  you mean a [ un non-authorised nato agression on a sovereign country ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_bombing_of_yugoslavia ) ? 
  stoping an ethnic war ? 
  that 's either naive , intentionaly misleading or just plain uninformed . 
  [ check this out ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_unrest_in_kosovo ), 
  smooth move ignoring my comment and instead rambling how i am brainwashed by the state . 
   why is war the health of the state ? 
  well , because war strengthens and emboldens the state in ways that are not possible without war . 
  in war , `` patriotism '' i.e. 
  reverence of the state flourishes , leadership decisions are not questioned , population is galvanized against a `` common enemy '' , the institutions of the state are free to tighten their grip on the productive output of its population through increased taxation and regulation , plights of the common people can be safely ignored in the name of `` national unity '' or `` national security '' and ideally , borders are not changed or they are extended . 
  i trust the second quote is self-explanatory . 
  i agree . 
  external threat can often serve as an unifying factor , history has showed this many times . 
   unfortunately , you seem to be heavily entangled in the propaganda of the state , in this case the serbian state which seeks to shift your anger from itself and instead deflect it towards `` the enemy '' . 
  i am not angry at the serbian state itself , but merely at it 's incompetent ruling class/politicians as well as economic hardship and deterioration of morals and values in serbian society . 
  everybody who denies operation storm was an ethnic cleansing is a neo-ustasha too me or ustasha apologetic . 
  same with srebrenica deniers/neochetniks . 
   the only way to move beyond what happened is to first start seeing your `` enemies '' as normal people , motivated by same everyday things as yourself , and not some genocidal maniacs nationalist propaganda would have you believe . 
  the only way to move beyond what happend is to remember what happaned and learn from previous mistakes . 
  ndh genocide was covered up by the communists and what was the result ?

  i do n't think i could qualify as a high skilled worker . 
   higher professional qualifications are :  qualifications attested by evidence of higher education qualifications ;  attested by at least five years of professional experience of a level comparable to higher education . 
  do you know any good websites to search for a job in poland ( like monster.de for germany ) ? 
  how difficult is it for a young non-eu guy , with bsc degree ( not in it ) but very little work experience and no knowledge of polish language to obtain a work and residence permit in poland ? 
  so far i had zero luck with job applications in western europe , i get rejected as soon as they find out i do n't have eu passport . 
   a video that is actively being censored at the moment in turkey : turkish soldiers throwing a pkk member and executing another one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj1jkxeh_ak this kind of stuff has been proven to be counter-productive at fighting terrorism , and will actually just encourage more and more young men to join . 
  if this was n't turkey , i 'm sure they 'd already been getting democracy thrown at them from 10.000 meters . 
   i guess it depends on what people are buying instead of vodka . 
  maybe they make their own moonshine . 
  our government statistics count you as employed as long as you worked at least one day per year . 
  clever way to manipulate with voters .

  no to globalist tyranny . 
  it is young women that flee the most from east germany . 
  http://i.imgur.com/0w3dr5m.png [ entire study can be found here ] ( http://siteresources.worldbank.org/intwdr2009/resources/4231006-1204741572978/vollmer.pdf ) moldova would turn into giant sausage fest in no time after unification . 
  export ? 
  $ 549 with or without utilities included ? 
  how much does it go for utilities ? 
  or a young male in east germany ( except berlin ) looking for a partner . 
  i have no doubt that many people in turkey vote for erdogan because they think they 're doing the right thing . 
  controlled media is doing wonders . 
  it 's much easier for young women to move out and find a job , than it is for young men . 
  i 've recently read this interesting study which gives explanation why are there way more guys than girls in east germany in 18 - 29 age category . 
  people here rent apartments to couples ( or guys who want to bang an escort ) for around 10 eur per day . 
  they make more money that way , than if they would rent the apartment to a student . 
  it 's not surprising if you take into consideration what 's happening in turkey in recent years . 
  my assumption is some balkans country , except slovenia and maybe croatia . 
  we have a lot of guys like him here . 
  young women will always have more options than young men . 
  that 's the reason behind that fact . 
  i do n't think so . 
  no more mr. nice guy is a must-read book on the manosphere . 
  that 's good . 
  here you can even smoke in a bakery . 
  same thing in serbia . 
  with all the taxes , registration and mandatory insurance , it 's not affordable to have more than 1 car per family . 
  government is doing this in order to rob people , there are no other reasons beside that . 
  still better that , than 1000 articles on the front page about refugees . 
  is smoking in restaurants and clubs allowed in turkey ? 
  that 's what i find super annoying as a non-smoker here . 
  i have to throw all my clothes into the washing machine after a night out . 
  i can bet the article author is frequent on the manosphere . 
  / r/europe is default for european accounts . 
  coalition is in a grey area in syria . 
  but as long as they 're not attacking saa or ypg , everything 's fine . 
  i 'm living in a town , lack of young women and jobs is the biggest downside ( among many ) . 
  we have private clinics as well , but they do n't offer services like brain/heart surgeries , transplantation and many other . 
  so if you need any of these listed , your options are either bribing or dying waiting . 
  okay , i 'm adding that to my tinder profile . 
  here you can skip waiting lists if you 're ready to bribe enough . 
  looks like even serbia is ranking slightly better than us . 
  i 'm 175 cm tall , am i more immune to mutations ? 
  pre-referendum/election promises are only for suckers , to be honest . 
  just look up some syrian rebel combat footages . 
  and i thought they 'll at least learn how to hold a rifle properly after 5 years of fighting . 
   the problem is enormous and i do n't really see a way out .

  who told you that , cnn ? 
  or you 're just trolling . 
  milo\u0161evi\u0107 was fighting for unity of sfry in 1991 and 1992 . 
  after it became obvious it 's hopeless and there 's no way sfry can remain united without huge material and human losses , he decided to withdraw jna troops to serbia , disbanded jna and formed a federation with montenegro ( fry ) . 
  serbs in bosnia and croatia were acting on their own accord from that point , milo\u0161evi\u0107 had no control over them . 
  milo\u0161evi\u0107 was pressuring karad\u017ei\u0107 even back in 1993 to accept peace proposal and end the war in bosnia , which karad\u017ei\u0107 refused . 
  in 1994 milo\u0161evi\u0107 imposed sanctions on republika srpska in order to make more pressure . 
  milo\u0161evi\u0107 was strongly against ethnic cleansing that republika srpska army was conducting in bosnia . 
  learn some facts before commenting . 
  both republika srpska and republika srpska krajina wanted to be a part of sfry , and then fry , but slobodan milo\u0161evi\u0107 did n't want them . 
  you mean istok . 
   they were supposedly repeatedly asked to speak polish , when one of them actually did , he got punched . 
  what the fuck . 
  i do n't agree . 
  what 's your plan ? 
  no worries , they 've imported 1m of engineers and doctors last year . 
  beautiful . 
  we can only speculate , since there are no hard evidences . 
   in 2013 , rebels were not interested in any negotiations . 
  now in 2016 nothing is different . 
  they keep insisting on us intervention . 
   you mean when assad used chemical weapons ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ghouta_chemical_attack perpetrator is unknown . 
  maybe it was assad , and maybe it was rebels who hoped it will trigger us intervention . 
  us had their chance in 2013 to intervene in syria . 
  now they ca n't do much except sitting and watching . 
  ca n't tell if serious or just seriously trolling . 
   white women do enjoy foreign men because they 're new and exciting . 
  however their interest only goes as far as a fling or a short term relationship . 
   when it comes to long term relationships , white women tend to far prefer white men .

  google it . 
  how do you meet women in sweden ? 
  would they call the police if you 'd start hitting on them at the bus stop ? 
  sound pretty much like serbia outside of belgrade . 
  everyone , and especially young women leave their hometowns and head towards the belgrade . 
  due to female migration we now have ghost villages , and in some decades we 'll have plenty of ghost towns as well . 
  toss a coin to decide . 
  australia and new zealand as well . 
  there was a map a few months ago which was showing a huge lack of young women in east germany . 
  low birthrate after reunification therefore makes sense , when so many young women leave the entire area .

  in slovenia for instance an immigrant only gets health insurance if he 's working and then this benefit goes over to his family . 
  in my opinion it would be fair that those who pay taxes get benefits , while those who do n't pay taxes do n't . 
  it should n't matter whether you ' r a citizen or an expat . 
  it 's a very interesting article but i disagree with its conclusions . 
  the us is spending more money which is why its economy is growing faster . 
  it 's doing this by increasing their debt and with an 8-12 % deficit . 
  as you can see in the charts , us debt increased from 70 to over 110 % of their gdp , while eu debt went from 70 to 95 % and stabilizing . 
  and our deficit is at around 4 % . 
  the productivity of the eastern european countries is increasing steadily , while in western europe and the us it 's more or less stable . 
  overall this means the productivity in the eu is increasing . 
  in the longer run this means we can do more with the same amount of money , there wo n't be a need to increase our debt . 
  i 'm no expert but i predict that in the long run , 10-20 years from now , the us will struggle with a 200 % debt which will force austerity on them the kind we see in greece . 
  at the same time the eu will have a 50 % debt and a stable outlook for the future . 
  in the near future , possibly in 2014 , the us will experience another severe recession . 
  the eu wo n't . 
  it 's a beautiful sunny day in budapest . 
  funny how these little things can make people happy . 
  i disagree , there are several dialects and many more outside the borders of today 's hungary . 
  often it 's difficult to understand people from another region , for example it 's really hard for me to understand people from the region around kaposv\u00e1r . 
  also , many times when i 'm in budapest people ask me if i 'm hungarian or they just start speaking to me in english ... but where i come from the dialect i speak is considered normal and the budapest accent is considered gay  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_language#dialects, 
  interesting how communism did n't affect your work ethic . 
  when i grew up in serbia the popular saying was `` they ca n't pay me so little as little i can work '' . 
  the attitude changed since with the introduction of capitalism , but still many consider it a life success if they get a government job where they work for a few hours only . 
  i had a boring job where i had to work only a few minutes a day and pretend to work for the rest . 
  they paid well , but after half a year i was starting to go crazy and quit . 
  i do n't know how some people can live like that for decades . 
  is this news 2 or 3 years old ? 
  today politicians in serbia are drinking milk as a show of support to the minister http://www.blic.rs/vesti/drustvo/370032/zrenjanin-gradonacelnik-popio-mleko-u-znak-podrske-ministru, 
  he probably mistook germany for hungary . 
   thus less easily sympathized with are you saying people in the 50 ` es sympathized with the germans ? 
  or that what the greeks had done is worse than what the nazis did ? 
  i ca n't decide if this is the most stupid comment of the week , or the year so far ... 
  sajt is iranian ? 
  wtf ? 
  also interesting : in greek it 's turos , while in hungarian goat cheese is called t\u00far\u00f3, 
  learn a slavic language , then you 'll be able to understand almost all of eastern europe . 
  i 'm biased towards serbo-croatian since i speak it and think it would n't be difficult for a german . 
  the sounds are almost the same as in german , so it 's easier than hungarian or french . 
  the grammar also is n't very difficult , the language is pretty regular , once you learn the rules you 're set . 
  if you learn serbian then the added bonus is you 'll have to learn cyrillic , which means you 'll be able to read russian and many other languages from ex-soviet union . 
  [ wikipedia says ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_in_europe_by_monthly_average_wage ) a normal salary in italy is 2000 euros . 
  1100 would be too low . 
  i was making more than that in slovenia , which is considered poor by italian standards . 
  also , slovenia has 41 % taxes after 15000 euros , while italy has 43 % after 75000 . 
  if i was living in italy and earning 1100 euros like you say , i would be paying only 27 % tl ; dr ; stop whining like a pussy and pay your taxes . 
  you probably get furious at all those immoral criminals who do n't buy bus tickets, 
  it is if you 're not a student and ca n't get an isic card . 
  you could fake an isic but people tell me it 's an old idea and some security guards can notice .

  also with isic you sometimes only get a discount , while with a press card you go in for free . 
   we have a rule that says you can camp in the nature as long as you are well away from any buildings hi , is this true ? 
  could you back that up with some sources ? 
  i seriously want to visit norway but was always taken aback by the prices . 
  if i could camp for free that would be awesome and i could start planning my summer vacation right now !, 
  please reply , 
  just print a fake press card , attach your photo , put it in a plastic cover and go with that . 
  google `` press card '' to find some samples . 
  you can design your own in photoshop . 
  the press agency does n't have to be real , just invent a name that sounds real like `` global news agency '' .

  liver p\u00e1st\u00e9tom is very common here . 
  there 's also the fish variant but it makes me puke :(, 
  yeah this paragraph here is totally hard to understand :  financial market conditions in the eu have ** improved substantially ** since last summer . 
  but economic activity has been disappointing in the second half of last year . 
  however , leading ** indicators suggest that gdp in the eu is now bottoming out and economic activity is expected to gradually accelerate ** . 
  the pick-up in growth will initially be driven by increasing external demand . 
  domestic investment and consumption are projected to recover later in the year , and by 2014 domestic demand is expected to take over as the main driver of strengthening gdp growth . 
  this should be on the top of / r/europe . 
  just yesterday i got downvoted to hell for arguing that the european economy is doing fine and that better times are ahead us . 
  read this you pessimist assholes hahahaha !, 
  like most developed countries , slovenia has a shrinking and aging population and it needs more people to expand its economy . 
  i do n't say they absolutely must have immigrants , they can also make more children to solve the problem . 
  like i said , my opinion changed when i actually met romanians in person . 
  i even learned useful words like `` sugi pula maimutele '' , 
  you have no experience but do you have qualifications ? 
  without a degree you should n't expect much . 
  i do n't know how it would work for a portuguese guy but you probably have some community outside portugal . 
  find their website , for example `` portuguese in dubai '' and get in touch with those people . 
  in any case , if you go to a middle east country , never ever accept a job doing physical labor . 
  you 'll be working 12 hours a day on 60 degrees and earn $ 100 a month , unless the boss finds vietnamese who would work for less . 
  i really hated the slovenian system where they require you to know the language but provide absolutely no assistance . 
  only in 2009-2011 was there a program for immigrants that lived more than a year in slovenia and have a new visa for another year * - and that was financed by the eu ( so when the financing ended they cancelled the program ) . 
  i agree that people should learn the language but if you 're a tiny country with a language that no one knows , then at least make some effort to teach people !, 
  ^ ( * in my specific case my visa was valid for 10 months so i did n't qualify ), 
  i agree , i think relations between ordinary people are a lot better than what the media portrays . 
  i was actually surprised when i met some romanians at a concert and they seemed very happy when they found out i 'm hungarian . 
  this was completely contrary to what i 've been told by books and the media which basically say `` the romanians are the devil '' . 
  [ euro stoxx 50 rose 1,5 % ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/sx5e:ind ) compared to this time last year . 
  that does n't sound like recession to me . 
  also 2012 was a pretty good year for me , i 'm sorry if you had a bad year but it does n't mean everyone else has . 
  yesterday the s&p index was at its 5-year high , that 's just one positive news ... uhm look , if you want to see bad news , go ahead and search for bad news . 
  the reality is the economic situation is quite positive , 2012 was a great year and it 's expected that 2013 will be even better .

  after some unprofitable time you 'll be forced to close your booth and i 'm left there with your ex customers , and ability to control the prices as well as the unfair subside from john enabled me to easily remove you from the market .

  the same reason weed is popular in the usa - it 's socially acceptable . 
  i 'm pretty sure the biggest reason is the price . 
  ee does have a bit more smokers , but considering the pack price is 2-4 times lower than in we it 's not surprising . 
   in canada any adult can buy cigarettes . 
  no one is stopping you . 
  you can go to any grocery store , or any gas station , and get a pack . 
  the only difference is there 's basically no advertising for it , and the cigarettes are kept behind the counter so children do n't see the packages as easily . 
  they 're pretty much impossible for youth to shoplift . 
  the result is far fewer people smoke . 
  that 's how it 's here too . 
  that list does n't show properly how widespread smoking is because average cigarettes smoked per smoker could be higher for some countries and that would bring the whole average up even if their smokers ' numbers are n't as proportional . 
  this can be caused by habits and especially the cigarette prices . 
   and 1 $ - coins should be replaced by bills .

  `` one ** such ** fact is that the rs army committed the vast majority of war crimes '' - no , you said evidences are the facts , rs army thing is a `` presuda '' ? 
  ( how do you say it in english ? ) unimportant . 
  `` what 's `` blurry '' about 90s ? '', 
  - `` fact is that the rs army committed the vast majority of war crimes , ** which is probably why you dismiss it as political . 
  was it political when it freed seselj , may i ask ? 
  '' ** you still presume , like those young manipulated people in the 90s , that serbs worship chetniks , are chetniks etc. 
  judging from your other comments in the thread also . 
  a person who sees things clearly wouldnt do that . 
  `` one such fact is that the rs army committed the vast majority of war crimes , which is probably why you dismiss it as political . '', 
  - of course , im just a chetnik :d did you even doubt ? 
  the topic of the conversation between me and you is whether you were using whataboutism . 
  now you are using it for the 4th or 5th time . 
  so i guess this conversation is concluded . 
  `` i didnt , stop making things up '' - you said : - `` also lets also forget all those muslims killed in podrinje region by serb royalist chetnik bands . '', 
  - `` and that is excluding other crimes commited in montenegro . '', 
  he was talking about muslims/fake muslims attacking serbs and you started pulling out your papers with the list of serbs attacking muslims . 
  the way you described it doesnt suggest that whataboutism wasnt your primary goal . 
  even in another comment you say : `` so that absolves the serbs of their crimes in ww2 ? '', 
  whataboutism again , even when he is just stating facts , not excuses . 
  you can tell yourself that , repeat it for the rest of your life if you want . 
  but in your heart you know . 
  the court was a political one . 
  and even if we say the court is legit , still doesnt make 90s more than just blurry . 
  besides , a judge and his investigators are not time travelers to go and see what actually happened . 
  its all just guessing based on investigations . 
  so events and facts cant be '' confirmed at '' a court . 
  he was talking about serbian victims and you started saying `` but what about ... '' literally whataboutism . 
  typical for this kind of conversation . 
  `` what about what you did to us ? '', 
  that is actually how this comment chain started . 
  i cant , the amount of manipulation of historical documents in the last half of milenium of balkans is stupidly high . 
  nobody even knows what happened in the 90s !, 
  she is not considering ukraine a country obviously , just a region to be bargained with . 
  and she is not wrong unfortunately . 
  `` but nothing that happened to you is ever able to be questioned ? '', 
  - he never said that . 
  whataboutism . 
  `` one act does not justify the another . '', 
  - where did he say that that ? 
  `` what the croats did to the serbs in ww2 was the same what serbs did to the croats . '', 
  very wrong . 
  part of the indentity is freeing themselves from the slavery under turks , which i dont see anyting wrong with , but part of it is also from medieval `` information '' , for the most part it is neither though . 
  americans had their civil war , other countries had their struggles . 
  all part of their identities . 
  serbian `` nationalism '' ( you are talking about ethnicism ) is built upon being butthurt that their ancestors were too stupid to secure a better country for serbs , and allowed world powers and surounding peoples , like croats , to screw them over . 
  it has nothing to do with treating muslim population badly , in fact , this is proven by the fact that expulsion of albanian from southern serbia during ottoman collapse was all hush hush , and denied . 
  and that anyone today would be too ashamed of it to even consider it being true . 
  so treating bosniaks or albanians badly is certainly not part of serbian identity . 
  if it occurs naturally , then fine , but unfortunately , it is occuring because of bad economy , people want to stay but cant survive , and have easy acccess to hungarian passport , so why not leave , same with romanians , croatians etc. 
  and there are efforts from ( our ) hungarians , for example , to keep traditions alive and have people come back . 
  sorry , nothing then . 
  its late here . 
  and i wouldnt waste my time on a subject like yugoslav wars anyway . 
  i agree . 
  it is sad that people here are so primitive , but it is a fact . 
  so the borders should be rewritten : ** croatian ** majority parts of bosnia and montenegro to croatia , ** serbian ** majority parts of bosnia and montenegro to serbia , montenegro majority parts can choose to stay independent or join serbia . 
  ** bosniak ** majority parts of serbia , montenegro , croatia to bosnia - it would include exclaves , but if a proper agreement is made about free travel i dont see a problem . 
  ** albanian ** majority parts of montenegro , macedonia and serbia to albania ( with kosovo and maceodnian part as autonomous provinces just like vojvodina within albania or majority serbian and macedonian municipalities as exclaves to their countries . ) . 
  also have a free travel agreement among the countries , so people can visit their relatives , that are now in a different country and similar situations . 
  it would work like in the eu , which is where we are all headed anyway . 
  * vojvodina however not to be touched , there was never trouble here and we are not in the balkans . 
  unless we could gain bilaterally agreed independence , that would be neat , although kinda contradictory . 
  could you do a summary ? 
  `` but everyone just dismisses it as propaganda . '', 
  and downvotes it , it seems . 
  because there are serb enclaves deep into kosovo , not just the north . 
  im thinking , creating those special municipalities , recognising kosovo by serbia , some kind of free travel between kosovo and serbia would be the solution . 
  there are also gorani people who want to rejoin serbia but are at the very south part of kosovo . 
  ** also to be noted is that this is actually a fight for natural resources as kosovo is rich with all kinds of minerals and fuels . 
  this is actually the most important part . 
  `` i mean , i 've studied the work a few times over , and it explicitly states that those of the muslim faith are traitors to the montenegrin people and must be killed . '', 
  - that doesnt make it a manual for killing . 
  but yeah , its agressive , meant to rally the people against the sick man of europe , the ottoman empire . 
  '' ** other ** bosniak academics believe it played a key role in milosevic 's ideology . '', 
  other ? 
  are you one yourself ? 
  and it doesnt make sense that it played a role in milosevic ideology , his ideology was just keep yougoslavia as serbia , montenegro and if the bosnian winning side wanted to stay as well . 
  ( which he tried to help with supplies ) dont see much similarity . 
  in fact , milosevic was the only patriot in the whole conflict , every other leader was a nationalist . 
  those are not bad words . 
  just putting it into persperctive . 
  really ? 
  i dont remember a word from it . 
  could be , never read the damn thing . 
  it was not about genocide i would guess though , more about politics , montenegrins wanted the capital of serbia to be podgorica so they were rallying people on their side kinda , and vojvodina * / sumadija were doing their own lobbying for them to be the new center of serbia . 
  that is how petrovici were brakeing up into serbian and montenegrin ones . 
  ** vojvodina * was the actual centre of what could be considered serbia , all the serbian scientist and intelectuals came from here , until tito forbid us from doing anything other than farming . 
  i think you misunderstood what they told you and they are obviously biased . 
  from what i remember at school , gorski vijenac is not recited on school slava . 
  gorski vijenac does say something `` like you traitors of serbian kind blabla '' and when i went to school we analyzed it as any other poem ( or whatever the hell it is ? 
  ) , it was not sung in joy and celebrated . 
  just another poem saying whatever . 
  i guess to muslim children whose parents fill their ears with mythology and history ( which is common in this region for everyone ) it might be noticeable and make them feel bad because their parents made them feel like they are the same people as quoted in gorski vijenac . 
  however , `` ceremonies where orthodox priests call them bastards and filthy degenerates as they quote gorski vijenac at them . '', 
  this sounds like something not even a cheap hollywood movie scriptmaker would make up .

hey , maybe we could also join ?!, 
  i 'd love us to have a normal-ish school system again . 
  among other things . 
  not to mention this has a very high chance to make smaller isps go bust . 
  just like they did with some language schools ... 
  let 's see whether it still works today ( i sure hope so ), 
  yep , hung out on reddit a bit today still at the commission . 
  i would n't know what to do otherwise , sometimes it just gets * so * boring !, 
  hungary cooks its books by implementing a controversial community service/labour scheme . 
  to me , a foreign-born hungarian , it really looks like the tito-era yugoslavia where basically everyone had a job , but barely anyone did anything substantial ... 
  this made a sharp dent in unemployment numbers in the poor eastern regions , but oftentimes the positions are doled out at the whim of the mayors , and some people do n't get paid ( and the pay is quite bad , around minimum wage , which is de facto not enough to sustain a living minimum anymore ) ... as soon as the governing party 's system starts to show cracks , these numbers will skyrocket . 
  also , no government on the horizon yet again !, 
  edit : seems like you may have one after all . 
  why is n't luxembourg included ? 
  for all i know , they would be so deep red that it masquerades as black . 
  ( moving there tomorrow for a few months , do n't hate , i hate it enough ), 
  i think i 'll pitch it up to some of my meteorologist/weather-crazy pals and see whether it gains some traction ... 
  the site actually looks amazing !, 
  well , it 's exactly what the uk has done for centuries in the past ... karmic retribution may be slow , but ... 
  i 'd like to know where that portal is located and whether m\u00c1v / bkv / vol\u00e1n has rides there . 
  i 'd like to visit the abba museum sooo bad !, 
  refugees / migrants are n't eu citizens , though , so the comparison is out of place . 
  same here . 
  i 'm mostly left-leaning , and gay , but owing to my minority background i 'm also fairly nationalistic when it comes down to it ( yes , it does cause a little bit of cognitive dissonance , if perceived through the looking-glass of contemporary politics ) . 
  i still do n't think that we should really accept * everyone * , at least not those people who would actively seek to destabilise/deconstruct/destroy what had been hitherto achieved . 
  it 's not so much of a problem if there were n't any brains to begin with : /, 
  yup , it 's elte for humanities/some sciences , bme for engineering ( indubitably ) , and sote for medicine . 
  all three are universities in budapest , elte offering the broadest range of programmes . 
  though in the international rankings szte ( szegedi tudom\u00e1nyegyetem , in the southern town of szeged ) now outclasses even elte according to the metrics used . 
  which fills my little heart with pride ( did ba at elte , ma in szeged ) . 
  right . 
  our people at the subotica `` inti '' also went shooting to some strange shooting range , but i ca n't remember what was so strange about it . 
  it 's been some years now . 
  was it the high school dorm of subotica ? 
  here in budapest , even most turkish places sell gyros , as it rolls easier off the tongue ... dunno how they look into the mirror day after day , but the crunchy huf 10,000 bills must make them feel better ( it 's a bit difficult to wipe tears with the shiny new ones , though ) . 
  eh , i rather prefer mexican anyway , though i 'm yet to discover such a place in budapest ( there 's an excellent one in szeged ) . 
  no no no , the ode to joy would mean that turkey were put into an eu-context . 
  i mean , we 're good , but we 're not * that * good . 
  i know , we 're masters at that . 
  though going to work on m4 is actually quite nice . 
  31st , so technically they could still complete it on time ... 
  visited one of our twinned towns with my parents , 's a good thing we got two days off for the holiday . 
  food was passable , the organised events were ... well , normal for a rural little town . 
  need to get my serbian id done today , i 'll look shit as usual ( they make the photos without glasses for some reason , and i look shit without them ) . 
  and above all , i 'm still super annoyed that i caught the sziget virus and had to leave out the last three days cause i was pretty much constantly on the loo . 
  * `` smrt '' means death in serbian . 
  so yea , you are pretty much it . 
  or even \u010dvrsto\u0107a !!, 
  we should do some eszperente too !, 
  it is a playful way to speak hungarian , using * only * `` e '' as the vowel in words . 
  or  comfortable place , where you can eat enough as you please , but in this particular place you can spend all your salary . 
  you can do better than that , brate !, 
  yes , notice us , we 're drowning in migrants !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ send ^ ^ ^ ^ help ^ ^ ^ ^ pls, 
  oh dear , i can barely keep myself from a ) laughing out loud at the office b ) sending it to portuguese ex-colleagues of mine . 
  i doubt they would approve . 
  especially as they could not really retaliate . 
  they are !, 
  you call them like that ? 
  how nice . 
  they 're haso and mujo here around . 
  i much prefer the montenegrin jokes , though . 
  hungary reporting in , never heard or read about anything else than the richter scale in the media . 
  we have a very similar problem in hungarian ... 
  the english/international abbreviations lt and lv are exactly the opposite to their hungarian equivalents ( latvia/lv is lettorsz\u00e1g , with no v , and lithuania/lt is litv\u00e1nia , with a v ) , and it just means a world of hurt if you 're handling any of them ... 
  thing is , for luxembourg , where many of the eu 's linguistic services are located , that salary is actually around average , if not even somewhat low , taking into account the insane rent prices ( let alone real estate , which can easily run into millions of euros for a family house ) and the high price of living overall ( not counting gasoline , cigarettes , and alcohol , which are quite cheap ) . 
  brussels is better in this regard . 
  commuting can be painful in both cases . 
  : eu trainees receive $ 1050 monthly in both brussels and luxembourg . 
  for the brussels people , you can rent a comfortably sized room in a shared flat , and actually spend money on leisure stuff above your daily needs from that amount . 
  good luck with that . 
  the central link for permanent positions can be found [ here ] ( http://europa.eu/epso/apply/jobs/index_en.htm ) . 
  for maltese , there 's only openings this year for interpreters , which requires specific qualifications . 
  if rumours are to be trusted , next year there will also be a call for translators . 
  not for maltese , though . 
  they are hurting ( and hunting ) very bad for basically anyone who can fulfil a maltese position at eu institutions . 
  i 've interned at the european commission 's dg translation , and it was a rampant rumour among all translators that the maltese got off easy at the epso . 
  because of the low number of qualified people applying , the cutoff threshold was also super low ( artificially so , and probably against the general rules ) . 
  and though they work with machine translation quite a lot , their overall quality scores were somewhat low compared to other countries . 
  ah , good old / r/tumblrinaction never fails to amuse me . 
  yep , especially ( but not exclusively ) in central and eastern europe ( the newer member countries ) , this feeling of `` european-ness '' is taking on really slowly . 
  most of the educated population has adopted it more or less , but the masses of less-educated people are not really bothered by it . 
  the reasons are of course quite self-explanatory for this . 
  until these layers of society do not get elevated to somewhat higher levels of welfare and prosperity , the only common feeling will be jealousy , which begets hate . 
  as is demonstrated in this genious [ comic ] ( http://extrafabulouscomics.com/comic/160/ ), 
  could you link said trianon cry thread ( s ) ? 
  ever since m\u00f3nika-show ended , i 'm at a loss for quality butthurt . 
  thanks for bringing tears of laughter in my eyes . 
  after the clusterfuck @w \u00f6rk i really needed that !, 
  we have ... we were in a somewhat similar situation during the yugoslav wars , and then the kosovo war ... we do not * hate * them , nor do we actively try to harm them or anything . 
  we often even show solidarity if possible ( my parents and many people bring food to the migrants hiding in the little woods not far from the village ) , but the little things just annoy us too much to be able to cope with it for too long . 
  the only thing we feel by and large is * resentment * towards the powers that be both in the eu and inside the country . 
  we receive no help from outside or inside while the migrants harm our infrastructure and environment , and blame always gets shifted more and more outwards ... `` inner '' europe ( or as i call it , europa superior ) tries to tow them to border countries like hungary ( europa inferior ) , then hungary in turn tows them even further to our place , which is already outside the eu , and then they ( or we , as i am hungarian and live there myself ) put on a straight face and say it 's not their problem or competence anymore to help/support the migrants anymore . 
  i feel really sorry for the migrants as really no-one wants to care for them or help them in any real way , but in the end it 's the little fishes that get to muck up all the remnants ... and everyone else plays the saint and washes their hands . 
  dunno how understandable this was . 
  edit : grammar, 
  ahh superb ... 
  i 'm from a small hungarian village just south of the border , and we 're already inundated with migrants , even though they usually do n't stay more than a few days before heading straight for the border ... 
  unless of course the smugglers do n't tell them which way to go . 
  some even started logging the parks and the riverside boughs for firewood , the local council is furious , but we 're powerless ...

the funny thing is once you take religion away , the mentality and culture are very similar . 
  i know romania is a few centuries old but that does n't mean that there were n't romanian kingdoms and duchies . 
  wallachia and moldavia have existed for a long time in one form or another . 
  well romania was ruled by tatar groups for a while , and they may have some connection with sarmatians and scythians . 
  according to serbian news , not sure if it 's true , it was the albanian pm 's brother . 
  if verified , this is unbelievably idiotic . 
  i hope you are n't serious . 
  we tolerate them somewhat . 
  like it helped in poland ? 
  mirko , long time no see . 
  true, 
  once you start labeling people as civilized or not civilized you begin sliding down this long slippery slope . 
  english , decent french , serbian/bosnian/croatian / montengrin ( so 3 or 6 depending on who you ask :p ) also learning extremely basic german and i understand spanish decently . 
  well the main argument is that kosovo was never a yugoslavian republic . 
  are you serious ? 
  why ? 
  is this supposed to be a problem ? 
  except when it comes to muslims or africans right ? 
  hungary , serbia , romania have a lot of dry , smoked meat . 
  hungary . 
  yes but why do you keep sneaking in these shitty , xenophobic , nationalistic , 90 's songs into many of your posts ? 
  how do you keep getting top comment every time . 
  south stream has a possibility of getting redirected entirely . 
  look at progeda 's link . 
  look at progeda 's link , even the uk has a 22 % illiteracy . 
  according to that 17 % is pretty good . 
  how does serbia have a 98 % literacy rate then ? 
  what is the difference between the two statistics ? 
  i 'm not sure if you believe the video , but what she says is n't true . 
  plus she moved out pretty early from yugoslavia . 
  i really have no words for that video . 
  montenegrin albanians are pretty chill . 
  ( the only albanians i 've met ), 
  they helped us in the same way that the west is helping ukraine . 
  attempting to gain influence , but really not particularly caring for the country . 
  oh no , i do n't think britain and austria-hungary were much better . 
  i 'm just saying this feeling of love for russia that is often popular is kind of stupid . 
  since when have we mixed with gypsies ? 
  i would have rather become a german subject then have 58 % of our army just die , and hundreds of thousands of civilians due to typhus , and other diseases . 
  i would rather that the entire leadership was n't required to retreat all the way to corfu because of the loss of the war . 
  living under austria-hungary would not be as bad as you would think , and i think would have been a better alternative to losing many lives in the war . 
  downvote away if you want . 
  people in vojvodina had managed relatively fine under austrian rule for a long time . 
  i am 183 and compared to us , i am short . 
  compared to foreigners , i am often the tallest . 
  also i hope you 're not being serious . 
  the thing you posted as an usta\u0161e symbol is the flag of croatia . 
  no worries . 
  what you say is all valid . 
  i agree the crnaruka is an idiot . 
  one thing that you are wrong on is that slavs , at least south slavs , were n't forcefully christianized . 
  bulgaria , and serbia gradually converted due to missionary efforts from eastern rome , while croatia gradually converted as well due to efforts from rome . 
  there was no force involved . 
  also , valens seems to disagree with you . 
  i 'm not saying you 're wrong or he 's wrong . 
  also , i have this guy downvoted to -30 [ imgur ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f89f4xj.png ), 
  wwi would have been better off never happening , as we lost an extremely large portion of our male population not to mention the casualties in many other nations . 
  support during the war in yugoslavia and kosovo issue was simply due to their own interests opposing nato and the west . 
  they really did not do that out of a sense of brotherhood with serbia . 
  there was recently a poll done in russia where citizens were asked to name countries they consider as allies of russia , serbia was nowhere on the list . 
  the feeling of brotherhood is oneway for the most part . 
  but they 've never done anything outright positive for us either without wanting something in return . 
  yet people still think russia and serbia are allies to the end for some reason . 
  serbia and albania are also part of the dinaric alps :p, 
  likewise the love for russia from serbia is also silly . 
  a slav from the south . 
  so slovene , croats , bosniaks , croats , serbs , montenegrins , macedonians and bulgars . 
  i should start doing this too . 
  yes you are right . 
  i 'm just saying it did happen , i did n't mean to say that persecution was the main cause . 
  yeah we fucked up . 
  seriously , we did , and i 'm not saying this to mock . 
  i never understood why kazakhstan is part of europe . 
  do you not think the song is at all ridiculous ? 
  i mean , on one hand i feel like croatia really should allow these cyrillic signs because there is no harm in it but on the other hand it is just an alphabet . 
  serbians get along fine without cyrillic and in some places use latin more . 
  honestly , basically yes . 
  montenegrins and serbs are extremely similar to each other , and one 's affiliation is very fluid . 
  my mother 's side of the family , for example , is all born and raised in montenegro as have their ancestors . 
  however , some of them identify as serbs , some as montenegrins even while living in montenegro . 
  even brothers can identify differently from each other despite being raised in the same family . 
  yep , people think unification with serbia would be good , but i think it would actually be an economic disaster . 
  serbia is already pretty shitty economically , and the addition of a large , new , even poorer , entity would make the situation worse . 
  moldovia uniting with romania would be a somewhat similar situation . 
  if you see , yes some areas became more serb than before due to genocide , etc. . . however the same thing had happened in the west , albeit to a lesser extent . 
  you might laugh or think it is archaic or whatever , but they are determined by religion . 
  you 're literally a bosniak if you are muslim no matter where you are actually from , serb if orthodox and croat if catholic . 
  it 's how ethnic groups are formed in the region and it 's really weird . 
  for example , there are a bunch of muslim serbs in a region of serbia and only recently have they begun to identify as bosniaks , despite having no prior relation with them other than religion . 
  if you look at the same map , bosniaks were killed/expelled from the east , while serbs were killed/expelled from the west . 
  flyingorange is hungarian :p, 
  free dacians is excellent . 
  crnaruka is a new serbian troll account i think . 
  if the szekely area got independence though , the entire area would be surrounded by romania . 
  there is no feasible way to draw borders for that region . 
  also , if you support redrawing of territorial borders due to majorities in border areas , then do you also support the independence of northern kosovo and republika srpska ? 
  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_vojvodina http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvania#historical_population i can not find info on slovakia but it is safe to say that slovakians formes a majority in their own nation . 
  in neither vojvodina or transylvania was there any clear hungarian majority but people are downvoting me anyway . 
  you think serbs , slovaks and romanians wanted to live under hungary ? 
  if you do , read some history regarding the relations between them .

  it really makes me wonder how much time will have to pass until we 're out of stock . 
  [ here 's the passport photo without watermarks ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nbsbnxw.jpg ), 
  he did what other migrants did . 
  good way to avoid any suspicion . 
  and he did n't care about leaving traces as he knew he will be dead in a month , he never wanted to hide after attack . 
  surprise akbar . 
  same for 200 kids in syria . 
  i agree . 
  illegals can sneak in unnoticed , while cops are busy harassing legal people . 
  here in serbia we get up to 400 migrants from bulgaria every day . 
  they hide in mountains and stay away from roads , and show up randomly along the border . 
   hope it wo n't be ~ ~ as interesting as ~ ~ the last one . 
  ftfy, 
  there will be less and less need for workers without higher education , nothing strange about it . 
  very interesting indeed , thanks for the link . 
  i would have totally missed that ama . 
   would n't that make them economic migrants then ? 
  it would , but they would never say that . 
  instead , you can say that you were forced to be drafted into assad 's army and that 's why you fled . 
  you 'll get political asylum because eu perceives assad as a dictator and persecutor of his own people , and not a legitimate syrian president . 
  is swedish government still granting permanent residence permits to syrians ? 
  i agree . 
  europe needs an offshore center for failed asylum seekers asap . 
  it 's a misdemeanor , but it 's not enforced and nobody cares . 
  they 're stealing your fence so they can put it on serbian border . 
  ^ lol, 
  that city is relatively safe in a comparison with northern albania , kuk\u00ebs for example . 
  here you can buy cigarettes and beer even if you 're 10 . 
  i 've read somewhere that the fee you pay is actually a `` punishment '' from your own bank because you use atms of other banks . 
  not sure if this is correct . 
  i actually like american football more than regular football . 
  croatia will build a fence on serbian border , it 's just a matter of time . 
  luckily it will take a few months for hungary to build a fence on romanian border , but after all borders are closed chaos is imminent . 
   i 'm guessing that most people who have arrived since then are probably still in the process/most probably have n't gotten their decisions . 
  i 've read that migrants are now waiting several weeks to even apply for asylum in germany , they 're camping outside some building and waiting for someone to read their number . 
  i do n't think it 's money here , maybe they 'll make some demands from libyan government to release some prisoners or something ? 
  isis did that in egypt with croatian worker they 've kidnapped . 
  why are serbian officials still there in libya ? 
  what 's that tiny red dot in austria ? 
  thousands of years ago there were n't jihadists with explosives . 
  if pyramids would be left unattended , they 'd soon become a target for extremists and treasure hunters . 
  you saw what isis did with monuments in palmyra . 
  pyramids in egypt would n't have any different faith . 
  pyramids in egypt would be long gone if they were n't so popular , bringing so many tourists and profit . 
  montenegro ? 
   apparently syrians do n't fall under the un convention . 
  that might be because there are still parts in syria that are not under threat from isis . 
  yeah , but majority of these guys from syria do n't claim they 're persecuted by isis , but by the government and therefore seek political asylum . 
  german government severed diplomatic relations with assad , and does not consider him a legitimate syrian president . 
  civilians in rebel held areas are bombed by regime constantly , there are indisputable evidences about this . 
  it gives them a legitimate reason to seek political asylum . 
  we should stop removing ourselves , there are 150.000 - 200.000 abortions every year , which is crazy . 
  must be asylum seekers in germany . 
  i guess that number is with kosovo and metohija included . 
  educated and skilled people leave , politicians stay . 
  it must be some mistake in the article . 
  30.000 people disappear from serbia every year due to low birth rate . 
  only 2500 eur ? 
  and did not ask for money in advance ? 
  legal immigration in germany for non-eu citizens is ( almost ) impossible without knowledge of language , university degree and work experience . 
  nurses can legally immigrate easier , but wages are small , and with current situation in germany , they 'll probably have to work in hospitals with migrants , where native population does not want to work . 
  illegal economical migrants who seek asylum should n't be allowed to stay and should be deported back to their home country as soon as possible . 
  legal economic immigrants are okay , someone needs to pay taxes . 
  wow , you 've got an ancient reddit account . 
  there 's no way to keep them in eastern europe . 
  even if you give them residence and work permit , a place to live and food , they 'll abandon it all and jump on the first train to germany . 
   sweden will pay for their own bad policies tax payers and children of tax payers will . 
  government will keep ruining the country and gifting tax money to migrants like it 's something that grows on trees . 
  and when they need some more money to give to migrants , they 'll just raise taxes . 
  illegal entry is not punishable by law if offender seeks asylum asap . 
  however , migrants illegally enter in 6 countries before they reach germany , with no consequences . 
  build a fence around serbia and make it a processing camp . 
  i 'm sure our government will happily agree if merkel promises that it will get them some eu accession points . 
   the eu migrant crisis has been one of the most problematic and complicated global issues of 2015 , with millions of people leaving war-torn countries like syria , afghanistan , and ** kosovo ** kosovo war-torn ? 
   i did n't compare coffeine `` addiction '' with e.g. 
  heroin or crack addiction , but with e.g. 
  the typical recreational hallucinogenic drugs , like e.g. 
  lsd - which is much more dangerous , but has an even lower addiction potential . 
  lsd dangerous ? 
  i would n't say so . 
  the fact there are people selling nbome claiming it 's lsd is the real danger . 
  because you can get od with nbome . 
   one of the main benefits is that drug addicts need help to battle their addiction problem . 
  by having injection rooms , it 's easier to approach the addicts and offer them that help . 
  this is so true . 
  i 've witnessed once that a pharmacist refused to sell needle to one addict , and she kicked him out of the pharmacy , with a lot of insults . 
  dumb woman is basically making addicts re-use old needles and get infected with hiv . 
  people wo n't stop doing drugs if you refuse to sell them a needle . 
  vote for the party that is the least likely to ruin the country . 
   what does lunch cost where you live ? 
  depends on how fast can you run . 
  ferrying them directly to lesbos would save lives and eliminate smugglers . 
  but it would also mean that even people with a couple of euros in their pocket can afford the journey . 
  and less risky and less expensive journey will result in tens of thousands of people coming to europe from all over the asia , regardless if it 's winter or summer , every day . 
  transit countries will not be ready for this situation , and germany neither . 
  imho , any kind of open borders with turkey is harmful . 
  no idea about ghosts , but ufos do exist . 
   they will move asap , like everybody else , move to the bigger cities where the chances for employment and education are alot higher . 
  bigger cities are also attractive for a bit different activities ... 
  according to letter written by czech doctor in germany , there are cops with k9s in every hospital where migrants are , and also in big pharmacies .

that 's just impossible . 
  it would take a lot of shit to happen to cause russia to join the eu, 
  `` small serbia '', 
  some of you croats simply cant go a thread without shitting over serbia , can you ? 
  it already is on 4chan as poortugal, 
  the reddit secret service thanks you for your cooperation, 
  what were you banned for ? 
  and what was your username ? 
  hitler and napoleon approve, 
  have you thought about the possibility the data is incorrect ? 
  why not ? 
  you should read the article twice before any rash posting . 
  i wonder where is this data collected , because if i had to guess id sad serbia is on 5-10 % max, 
  finno-ugric people, 
  you 're incorrect ... 
  typical `` nikada do 90tih nisu imali drzavu '' person, 
  same here . 
  there were two drops actually - a lighter one after the crimea situation , and a massive one after the refugee crisis . 
  it could also have to do with the fact it 's been made a default sub not so long ago . 
  regardless , the sub used to be far better . 
  i didnt bring religion onto this, 
  putting serbia in the same category with albania and turkey is just stupid . 
  bih higher pp than montenegro , serbia and hungary ? 
  yeah , no way this is correct . 
  few years ago our girls ana and jelena were place 1 and 2 on the wta ranking, 
   i 've seen at least one estonian user argue here on reddit that we have nothing at all to do with the other baltics . 
  pretty crazy . 
  oh , i think that guy argued with me and a lithuanian guy . 
  the only pro russia parties are dveri and radicals . 
  radicals are around on 6-7 % and dveri are around 4-5 % . 
  two of them are the only right wing parties . 
  are you serious ? 
  they are even called `` zveri '' here which means beasts . 
  probably among the worst parties in this elections . 
  it will change the tide a bit against him , as a lot of young undecided voters are huge fans of theirs . 
  they have 4 million views in 4-5 days after all . 
  if all of the pro russia and anti eu parties made a coalition , they woulnd ' t have more than 20 % votes . 
  serbia is n't close to the eu because of the political reasons * cough * kosovo * cough * . 
  difference between serbia , romania and bulgaria are n't that big to be honest . 
  and we 're definitely way more developed now than you were when you entered the eu . 
  why not ? 
  a lot can happen in 14 years . 
  +1 i get that its a black mail , but you people do n't realize how fucking rich the corporations are . 
  also you get the skilled work force from the countries with high taxes , not from the tax havens , so they should kinda repay for it . 
  small businesses should have smaller taxes than corporations . 
  they have austria and germany ... 
  in most of the middle eastern countries women are forbidden to drive under the sharia law . 
  most common 3rd lang is german , then followed up by russian and french . 
  in some elementary schools there is no choice , and in some there is , depends on its teacher capacity . 
  in highschools in most cases you can choose your preference . 
  also majority of highschools have latin as well as 4th language . 
  i 'm sorry but , however politically incorrect it seems , the fundamental teachings of islam do n't really comply with `` european values '' . 
  there is no way i 'd consider someone to be an european if he thinks women should be covered entirely in public , should n't drive cars or are in any way valued as anything different but a birthing organism . 
  there is no way i 'd consider chopping someone 's hand off for a theft or stoning someone because of his sexual orientation is european . 
  so , how much of a muslim someone is * does * matter , no matter how politically incorrect it is . 
  also , culture and religion may be different things , but religion is part of one 's culture and it defines it greatly . 
  and in dota and cs go . 
  you seriously do n't understand what gdp is and what it represents then . 
  why are there so many removed comments ? 
  this is probably the most fitting one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njtmtsxts_i chorus version with english translation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cko9mbwjqa this is a close contender : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcntqnxunee it 's a song about serbian and bosnian knights which fought the turks on kosovo field in 1389 in the battle of kosovo . 
  the translations : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/himna_kosovskih_junaka, 
  i only agree with the 2nd one being ` representative ' of serbia . 
  i can guarantee that most of the serbs have n't ever heard the other 3 . though i do n't understand why have you put a version of `` hajde jano '' sung by a foreigner ? 
  the accents sound way off, 
  i 'm becoming more and more certain that / u/da _ zna_bula is a \u0161e\u0161elj-bot . 
  what he literally does for the whole day is spread pro russia and anti eu propaganda on serbia related threads . 
  firstly , most of the young people look up to western countries and most of us think russia is a cluster fuck . 
  it 's not a secret that serbians like russia/russians for helping us in various crisis , but to go and say we want to be like russia is hilariously stupid . 
  rusophilia is mostly prevalent with uneducated and hillbilly people here tbh , and it 's not even as great as certain posters here portray it to be . 
  after all , `` rusi su nas prodali '' ( the russians have sold us ) is often used saying here . 
  also lol @ the source - pravdareport.ru kek cheers, 
  well thank god your opinion does n't count in these matters , otherwise half of the eu countries would n't be accepted on the same grounds . 
   we call people who are extremely pro-eu as eu talibans you 're either a diaspora serb or just flat out bullshiting , beause i 've never even heard of that term . 
  because no one made it ? 
  how this thread usually goes :  someone says hurling  someone posts a video of it  someone says `` omg hurling is so amazing , i will start giving it more attention '', 
  it participated for the first time last year . 
  vampir is actually a serbian word , and the legend primarilly originated here . 
  the first `` recorded '' attack was in kisiljevo i think, 
  the problem with making burgers imo is that they have so many different individual ingredients so when looking at them and the whole process , i get like `` fuck this , ill just buy one , its easier '' . 
  thx for sharing though , if i ever force myself ill try it out, 
  people are kinda driven away from it because it 's inhabited by 15ish people who know each other and quite often make internal jokes in the comments that do n't really add up to the discussion . 
  having lurked it for a while i realized they 're nice people , but i understand why other lurkers hesitate to post . 
  things got better after they added the casual sub i think , but it may have been too late . 
  this is effect is further increased by it not receiving auto subs from redditors with serbian ip address . 
  then you do n't get that much from it as your trade with the uk is already kinda big . 
  canada wants this deal to trade more with germany , sweden , italy , france etc. 
  to be honest , serbian - croatian relations have become a way to pick up some easy political points . 
   serbia is trying to join the eu  croats do n't really like serbia  block their chapter  get more votes also works vice versa, 
  done in paint 100 %, 
  please ... [ pin\u0111ur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pindjur ) is the masterrace, 
  tbh i think serbian \u010ce\u0161ka ( pronounced as cheshka ) is pretty neat, 
  jersey is a tax haven so it 's not comparable, 
  i 'm sorry if you ca n't handle it , but that 's just how almost everyone feels , how it 's being classified by the eu , by politicians and by the encyclopedias . 
  ** this ** serb just follows the standards everyone has set on this subject , rather than ** this ** estonian 's aspirations . 
  how can you be certain other nordic countries see you as nordic ? 
  because on this sub i 've got the impression that they do n't . 
  you 've not even given a single compelling argument on this subject , but instead procceeded to call my opinions stupid as `` i 'm not estonian '' . 
  therefore i 'm done with this argument . 
  i 'm pretty positive this guy was the lead role in a german movie called `` final race '' or smth like that . 
  estonia is baltic geo-politically , but not ethno linguistically .

  i hope you are a troll, 
  you sound like an islamic extremist , except christian . 
  ignore him , he is a bigger failed troll then one i met an hour and half ago, 
   russians , romanians , and moldovans have a nearly identical culture . 
  do you know literally nothing about the countries you are judging ? 
  romanians and moldovans are nearly identical , but russians are not even close . 
  i really congratulate you on how you pulled this troll out . 
  now get out and stay in your home and judge other countries without visiting them nor reading a few facts about them . 
  i am afraid you should do that first before judging other nations about their problems . 
   every single day you have protests like that in europe from the muslim population . 
  we do ? 
  yeah , you are right , the rest of the usa is completely crime free !, 
  safe society forever !, 
  europe is uncivilised and nobody there has rights and people shoot each other on every corner !, 
  both western and eastern media say otherwise . 
  and before you criticise other nations for their problems , please fix yours . 
  crime is way more abundant in your country than in pretty much anywhere in europe . 
   a country which is the perfect example of how a multi-cultural nation should operate lel `` perfect example '' not even close, 
  nobody should think about traveling to the usa at this point of time ( where daily 7 black people are killed ) . 
  better ? 
  independence to catalonia !, 
  of course you do n't , being serious sounds like your only personality, 
  you do realize it was a joke , right ? 
   bosna ( sometimes bosner ) is a spicy austrian fast food dish , said to have originated in either salzburg or linz . 
  it is now popular all over western austria and southern bavaria . 
  does n't sound even close to bosnia ?? 
  are you hiding something ?

  you are right . 
  a few days ago i submitted links , the entire page in the `` new '' section ( with my link ) had under 10 votes , including my own too ( which got 0 but later got to just a bit bigger ) . 
  pls no 1999 again, 
  but they are completely innocent . 
  they probably want peace too , and it is not okay to have them hated and booed at because they are , in this case , russian . 
  maybe we should take a peaceful measure , but banning their people from entering a singing contest not related to politics is not a ` quite nice peaceful measure ' . 
  just because their government is acting like the ruler of the world does n't mean we should ban them from a friendly , family singing-contest show that is n't supposed to be related to anything political . 
  i heavily disagree with russia 's government 's actions but i do n't think they should be banned from a song contest . 
  yeah , the joke is so good i laughed 4 times, 
  you mean the opposite ? 
   and the russians who think that sweet baby jesus putin is the holy saviour of their plight are idiots . 
  this is literally how a majority of serbs here act as well ( take putin as if he was a `` holy creature '' ) , and it makes me sick : /, 
  the spanish government really wants to start a full-scale revolution ... 
  we need your vote !, 
  i like the dutch song .

  ** serbia ** * [ a new alliance was formed between serbia , romania and bulgaria , called the craiova group , with the purpose being furthering the three countries ' european integration , as well as economic , transportation and energy corporation between each other .

  silly , south stream is no more , is only turkish stream now, 
  meh , i would include azerbaijan and kazakhstan under somewhat european too .

  the only reason it lasted as long as it did were its great defenses and geographical location , which made the turks want to go after all the surrounding balkan states first . 
  the conquest of constantinople was just the icing on the cake . 
   he was of mixed greek and bulgarian descent . 
  how do you know that he was seen as a greek his grandmother was half bulgarian half greek . 
  that makes him 7/8 parts greek . 
  and he had his troops with him when they took the city ... 
  evrenos was also a greek who converted into islam and led the ottoman armies in many campaigns . 
  he was there at the battle of kosovo and led the sack of serbia in 1409 . 
  and let 's not forget john vi kantakouzenos . 
  he was the first one to actually summon the turks into europe because he needed help to gain the imperial throne . 
  his extensive use of ottoman aid directly led to their conquest of gallipoli and all others that followed . 
  janissairies were n't voluntary members of the ottoman army . 
  the ottomans took healthy male children from the balkan christian peoples ( serbs included ) and raised them in the islamic way so that they could serve as elite soldiers and statesmen one day . 
  serbs , as a people , did not cooperate with the ottomans , outside of a few regional lords who were forced to act as vassals for a period of time . 
  your comment is a vulgar generalisation of history . 
  it 's written in the italic font , that 's why it looks like an 'm ' . 
  i like how you all downvote without giving a source or an explanation . 
  lmao . 
  it only shows how dumb and ridiculous all your claims are . 
  the icty conducted a separate investigation from the rdc , thus the numbers we posted are different . 
  they seem to be in accordance , more or less , when it comes the total number of civilian and military casualties . 
  the numbers differ when it comes to the bosniak and serb victims specifically , even though they used more or less the same sources . 
  the rdc is based in sarajevo and an inpendent institution , which obviously makes it prone to be less objective . 
  i would n't trust an institute based in the city which suffered plenty during the war to give me completely accurate results . 
  it 's similar to how in serbia researchers claim that 700 000 serbs were killed in jasenovac alone , while the truth is that the total number of serb victims in the entire ndh was around 320-340\u00a0000 . 
  anyway , the number of people who died in the war was n't even 100k . 
  the population before the war , according to the census , was around 4,3 million , which means that around 2.5 % of the population perished . 
  if you compare that to the other conflicts in balkan history , it does n't seem even remotely as massive as most people are making it out to be . 
  that makes any comparisons to the holocaust a complete joke and , honestly , a complete insult to everyone who perished both back then and in the 90s . 
  it 's just as dumb as people comparing putin to hitler ... it has no basis other than the bias inside the minds of the individuals making such claims . 
  now , i want to set one more thing straight . 
  i 'm not saying what happened is n't a tragedy . 
  even one life lost to an ethnic conflict is pointless . 
  all of that could have been avoided it were n't for certain individuals and their delusions . 
  i 'm just saying that this thread is full of insane exaggerations . 
  edit : messed up the percentage, 
  what is the source of that claim ? 
  serbia and all the other republics of yugoslavia had their own separate constitutions . 
  this constitution removed kosovo and vojvodina as separate entities and changed the name of the republic so it was no longer ` socialist ' . 
  it still remained a part of yugoslavia , as you can see here : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_republic_of_serbia where the hell did you even dig up that ? 
  even google shows nothing relevant when i type in ` serbia was the first country that de facto broke from yugoslavia ' . 
  again you bosniaks lie about the number of victims . 
  this is the offical concensus :  according to the icty demographic unit , an estimated 69.8 % or 25,609 of the civilians killed in the war were bosniak ( with 42,501 military deaths ) , with the bosnian serbs suffering 7,480 civilian casualties ( 15,299 military deaths ) , the bosnian croats suffering 1,675 civilian casualties ( 7,183 military deaths ) , ... 
  i do n't see how this is in any way comparable to the holocaust , where millions of people were killed . 
  how can you say the territories were ethnically cleansed when such a low percentage of civillians died ? 
  they did n't get annexed , the montenegrin parliament made a decison to unite the country with serbia . 
  tesla is the name of a tool used for wood carving : https://sr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0422\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0430_ ( \u0430\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430 ) or , in english : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/adze it comes from the verb ` tesati ' : https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/tesati the surname only appears vlahic because it ends with an ` a ' . 
  not all serbian surnames end with ` vi\u0107 ' . 
  anyone can edit the pages , but more prominent articles are usually kept under watch by the moderation team . 
  so if it were the offical opinion in romania , it would be represented accordingly in the article . 
  similar how in serbia there are certain people who believe serbs are an ancient race and have always lived in the balkans . 
  the wiki mods have to constantly prune the ancient/early medieval articles of their crap . 
  he winks, 
  what 's funny is that one of your fellow romanians is claming the same thing in a post above the same thing , except he 's actually serious ... 
  now if you could share with us the document where it says his father 's name is ` milutin teslea ' or a source where tesla talks about his supposed romanian ( lmao ) origins , that would be great . 
  stop spreading misinformation . 
  even your wikipedia does n't mention that crap, 
  he was n't of romanian descent . 
  there is no source that can back that claim up . 
  if you google ` milutin teslea ' all you will find is some romanian forums mentioning it . 
  it 's intresting to see how many people upvoted his outrageous post even though he refuses to name any sources . 
  people will believe almost anything you serve them , lol . 
  slavs settled the entirety of the balkans in the late 6th and early 7th century . 
  there were many diferent tribes of slavs and those in modern day serbia ( except western serbia ) did not call themselves serbs as far as we know from the sources . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sclaveni later on as the serbian state spread , so did the serbian identity . 
  that 's how it was . 
  it 's based on the work of the emperor constantine vii porphyrogenitus dubbed de administrando imperio , which , among other things , serves as the most important source on early serbian and croatian history . 
  whatever you say , i trust my own eyes more than the hallucinations of some random redditor . 
  the next time you see a thread about serbia , please take your pills , schizophrenia is a serious illness . 
  have a good night . 
  well , i 've been to greece and so have tens of thousands ( or more ) of my countrymen . 
  there 's a reason why so many of us like to go to your country , it 's because that 's one of the countries where the people make us feel at home the most . 
  and the greeks on reddit also disagree with you . 
  i suppose , then , 90 % of greeks vote for the golden dawn and go to chruch every sunday ... yeah right . 
  stop trying to paint your own fringe opinion as reality , it 's making you look like a schizophrenic . 
  why has there been such a surge in the amount of conspiracy quacks claiming vaccines cause autism ? 
  was there any major event/scandal that triggered this shitstorm ? 
  most of them only know about the uk , france , germany , spain and italy out of all the european countries . 
  and you thought correctly . 
  it 's just one guy venting for whatever reason in every thread about serbia . 
  the problem is he likes to speak in the name of all greeks , so if out of all of them you read only his posts , your perception of reality would be drastically skewed . 
  there are many black players here in both football and basketball . 
  almost none of them went through any racial abuse . 
  in fact , the players that do get insulted are the local ones . 
  sometimes even coaches , presidents of clubs and their families suffer verbal abuse . 
  sadly that 's just the way things are in the balkans . 
  we did n't deny anything . 
  all of our media is buzzing about . 
  the only one turning a blind eye is fc rad , the club that was responsible for all of this . 
  that view is just as common in your culture . 
  just ask jamie foxx , 
  he said rad , not red star ( crvena zvezda ), 
  yeah , i do n't remember such a huge incident ocurring here before . 
  though tensions are high in serbian sport right now . 
  for example , two days ago a man got hit in the face by a torch that one of the hooligans threw from the other side of the arena in the finals of the serbian basketball cup . 
  if rad ( the racist fans ' club ) does n't get punished severely , this sort of thing might happen again one day . 
  not in the balkans , that 's for sure . 
  he does n't even write those messages . 
  they just bring him a piece of paper , tell him it 's something important and he signs it . 
  trump could n't give less fucks about the balkans .

  not sure if the latter is true ... 
  it 's really more of an indifference . 
  i have met very few people who actually * dislike * russia . 
  i never denied collaborations . 
  i only denied the level of comparison , let me quote :  to claim that the chetniks were nazi collaborators ** like the ** ustase ... meaning on the same level . 
  yes , i know all of this . 
  i only really had issues with you equivocating the level of nazi collaboration between the two groups . 
  i 'm not supporting any side . 
  i 'm just pointing out a very big false comparison . 
  you make it sound very one-sided when it was anything but . 
  and yes , i expected international law to be followed , but * geopolitics * . 
   like usta\u0161e in croatia , chetniks were nazi collaborators , and as such are historically `` on the wrong side '' . 
  what ... you 're kidding right ? 
  to claim that the chetniks were nazi collaborators like the ustase , is laughable . 
  only one of the groups were aligned with the nazis . 
  stop being a revisionist . 
  for anybody that 's curious , [ here is the wikipedia article for ustase ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usta%c5%a1e ) for your perusal . 
  and [ here is the one for chetniks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chetniks ) . 
  even a simple search for `` nazi '' on either page will show you that / u/huntruder38 is full of it . 
  that 's incorrect . 
  `` crimes against humanity '' took place against both sides , ** years ago ** . 
  when kosovo declared independence , nothing of the sort was going on , and had n't been for years . 
  everything will be okay , i promise . 
  i think it 's almost a winter olympics tradition now for something to break during the opening . 
   regardless , absolutely stunning intro . 
  i was floored . 
  ... i 'm so sorry . 
  yes , it can actually take 5 minutes , but i gave a very good reason for the delay , and hopefully an even better one soon .

  that 's not too much of a problem because we also ask where they 're more active : / r/europe , or their country 's subreddit . 
  so we can weigh answers based on that . 
  last survey it was the belgians , this survey , the poles ... 
  the former had the survey linked on / r/belgium , the latter ... well , i 'm not sure what 's up with poland this time around . 
  in any case , we 'll probably end up involving sister subreddits , / r/sweden , / r/greece , etc.

  i 'm well-aware of that . 
  we have a thread [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1vyaa6/euromaidan_thread_1_discussionslinks_regarding/ ) for updates of this kind . 
   why do the serbs want back a province with a huge majority of albanians ? 
  would an acceptable compromise to serbians perhaps be , like in our history , a plebiscite which would return the serb majority areas to serbia ? 
  or a greater deal of autonomy for kosovo-serbs ? 
  it 's more complicated . 
  kosovo was already an autonomous province . 
  but i think as time goes on , the compromise you mention at the end is probably the way things will happen . 
  the problem is that the current government in kosovo does n't want this to happen for some reason . 
  in my mind , this is the * only * solution . 
  also , thanks for the small history lesson for denmark . 
  it 's actually good to know . 
  nuh-uh , you started it !, 
  it is n't a debate because you 're the biggest icj parrot i 've ever witnessed . 
  i shudder to think if the icj should vanish , how you would stumble through the dark , afraid now that someone is n't telling you what to think . 
  the thought of having holding your own opinion must frighten you . 
  there , there . 
  cheers . 
   that is your statement in this debate . 
  hardly in line with you being for kosovo 's independence ... 
  please try to keep your train of thought at least somewhat coherent . 
  this is n't a debate and that was said in context with the consistency thing i brought up . 
  things are n't going to seem coherent if you take them out of context . 
   nato  serbia never going to happen . 
   could you tell us what proof was actually provided and some things about op 's position ? 
  it 's not that i do n't trust you / u/metaleks , but i have no idea who you are . 
  for all intents and purposes you 're just as alien to me as op is . 
  fair enough .

well all of us did , i 'm just saying that greece had basically all of europe at their backs when fighting for independence, 
  you had plenty of help from western romantic emo hellenophiles , all we had was our flintlocks and good ol' serbian know how . 
  ^ jus ^ jokin ^ bro ^ u ^ know ^ we ^ love ^ u ^ 4eva, 
  there was a film on the politics behind wwi on viasat history recently . 
  i ca n't quite recall the name , but palpatine from star wars was in it , and so was meryn trant from got . 
  okay so the thing is there were quite a few scenes i found amusing , for example kaiser wilhelm being on vacation in norway at the time austro-hungary declared war on serbia as planned , just expecting the austro-hungarians to roll over their tiny enemy like truck in a couple of days , and for it to be all good and over by the time his holiday ends . 
  i mean ... 
  i know it 's wwi after all , but i really feel like the film took every opportunity to take a jab at the germans and austrians , and undermine them at every turn . 
  was n't trying to offend , wwii was n't great on anyone . 
  you gon na take wwii shit from a romanian ? 
  more like completely the opposite , imho . 
  seldom do americans even know where we are , let alone consider us the good guys :d, 
  no , literally , i 've never heard anyone here hate on albanians because of religious differences . 
  many , many other reasons , i am not going to deny that , but religion is not one of them . 
  it is . 
  no , religion has very little to do with it in this case , since albanians are n't exclusively muslim , a lot of them are christians , and a lot are atheist . 
  this is a territorial dispute , which a war was fought over not so long ago , so there 's still bad blood among some . 
  of course , i 'm not justifying this savagery , just explaining the `` reasoning '' behind it . 
  agreed . 
  it 's funny bordering on terrifying . 
  well ... by the modern definition yes , technically , but barely . 
  as i said , the definition has changed quite often , the first one would put macedonia almost entirely in today 's greece ( and a little bit spilling into albania ) , but for example , the byzantine definition came nowhere near the others , considering the land surrounding constantinople on the european side macedonia , excluding kosovo , albania , serbia , fyrom and ancient macedon completely . 
  by the roman definition it included macedon , fyrom and like half of today 's albania . 
  what has been considered `` macedonia '' or `` macedon '' has drastically changed over the centuries depending on who ruled it . 
  today it 's accepted that the region of macedonia encompasses parts of fyrom , greece , and south western bulgaria iirc . 
  sorry again , my mistake . 
  oh , and i 'm not your buddy , pal !, 
  no , no , no , dude ... 
  nothing against you guys , but the main comment said `` portugal can into slavic '' , so then when lithuania was listed with belarus and poland i thought the commenter implied you were slavic as well . 
  my bad d :, 
  well ... 
  i mean ... 
  they are n't a slavic country ... one could argue that there 's a balto-slavic family , but lithuanians are n't slavs afaik . 
  well if we 're talking slavic , the lithuanians do n't really count anyway, 
  nah , we were all cool in the first one , for the second one we flipped our shit out on bulgaria, 
  he 's a dick , imho . 
  popular - very , but supported , mostly by old people , who freaking idolize him ( seriously , i can not joke about vu\u010di\u0107 around my grandparents or i get dirty looks and various snarks ) and to some extent the young who view him as the lesser evil . 
  i mean , on the one hand , he 's a massive lying prick , but on the other , every politician is , the difference is vu\u010di\u0107 is not a stupid man by any means . 
  actually his popularity is almost irrelevant , he 's got everyone in his hands . 
  google belgrade 's most recent protests , check the demographics and numbers - that should give you a clearer picture if i failed to . 
  it is . 
  our great lord and saviour vu\u010di\u0107 has held a firm stance that he 'll never give up on kosovo and the serbian people . 
  it 's also anticonstitutional to present serbian territory without kosovo . 
  [ never stopped him before ] ( http://www.espreso.rs/images_arhive/original/1455538836_vuciccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc.jpg ) . 
  well he was n't wrong ... we put up a good fight for as long as we could , but ultimately it was russia that was a threat to them , not us . 
  hmmm ... makes me think , though russia 's hardly ever helped us directly and without catches , would just being associated with them make us valuable to the eu , like the croatian guy says ? 
  well i would n't say i 'm pro ... just that i could live with it , 
  then we finally understand each other :d i believe the first comment was aimed more towards the balkan nationalities , since the poster has the serbian flair , and not turks ( yeah , their territory extends to a part of the peninsula as well ) , so that 's probably what caused the misunderstanding . 
  i was n't talking about the turks , but yes , with most turks the difference is very noticeable . 
  but the peoples of the balkan peninsula also look very obviously different from most turks . 
  sure , you 'll have a tough time passing a croat or a serb off as a stereotypical norwegian , but you could n't tell him from a random frenchman or a random czech or a random german either - that was my point . 
  not sure if sarcasm , or bigotry ... 
  i do n't know how different you think our skin is to yours ... we 're as white as they come !, 
  unless gmo food has given you supervision and your eyes can detect more shades than a serb 's eyes can , 
  there are some who do n't care , but not because it does not concern them , but because they 've given up and came to terms with the fact that it 's albanian now . 
  which is n't to say it never will be serbian again , but as you said , i agree it wo n't be any time soon . 
  personally , i do care , about the history if nothing else . 
  i 'm okay with albanians living there , i 'm okay even with it becoming it 's own country , but i am not okay with them desecrating monuments and churches and forging history . 
  take it , but at least admit it used to be ours and respect that fact . 
  but then again , the opinions of some serbs do n't matter , the formal attitude of the government does , and the government says that kosovo is serbia , which is the biggest thing between us and the eu currently . 
  interesting . 
  no ... attacks ? 
  stoning ? 
  sounds too good to be balkan ^ / s, 
  given the state we 're in , i doubt we 'd pose any kind of a threat even if an eu - russia conflict were to break out and we were on russia 's side , which is n't that certain either . 
  and you forget the kosovo issue , my balkan friend . 
  that 's one thing they wo n't give us . 
  well we would if we could !, 
  it 's `` slaveni '' in croatia , so it 'd probably have a slightly nicer ring to it there, 
  they think they 're germanic probably, 
  if they evade turkish taxes by submitting themselves to allah you get bosniaks, 
  oh we have those douches east of the river too, 
  when did they invade us in the first place ? 
  serbia and montenegro that is . 
  and the tracksuit thing pertains to all slavs , not just russians, 
  i ca n't say i 'm as well - traveled as i 'd like to be , not yet , but this is the most enchanting building i 've had the pleasure of seeing so far . 
  i 've heard that linguists consider slovak to be the easiest language for all other native slavic language speakers to learn , since it shares a lot of characteristics with all other groups . 
  having been to slovakia once and having heard slovak on rtv for the slovak minority here , i sort of see why . 
  ahhh , makes sense . 
  though i seem to remember seeing kr\u010dmas when i was in bratislava couple years back edit : my bad , thought you said that meant ` pub ' in czech . 
  btw it means something along the lines of ` tavern ' here . 
  fuck , understood everything except for the other guy 's response, 
  nothing on the level on hollywood , but it does certainly have sayings , inside jokes and the capacity for puns . 
  another cool thing is the intuitiveness of it all , making knowing one word a gateway to all its other forms , compound words , antonyms ... 
  but that 's not what you meant , i suppose , and even though i am a proponent , you did point out one of the biggest weaknesess of esperanto - while it has a very warm , educated , welcoming speaker base , it lacks an underlying history and culture to attract learners , making the few speakers there are almost exclusively language nerds and their kids , 
  they are sort of burek-purists . 
  not even that , because their dumb made up burek regulations are dumb and made up !, 
  they do n't sound bad ... 
  it 's difficult to explain what i feel towards them ... 
  the sounds they produce are pleasing i guess , but they lack soul , it 's sort of empty, 
  the other commenter elaborated on that , so i 'm clear on that fact now . 
  however , now i wonder why such a normal thing was something to point out about france in particular, 
  was n't there an episode of house md about this very thing hahah anyway , thank you for clearing things up !, 
  ah , alright then . 
  the thing that was sort of interesting to me is that they said it can affect people 's behaviours . 
  and i was like : `` whaaat ? 
  and people just go along with this ? '', 
  well it 's not a rare occurrence by any means , but i do n't know if i 'd go as far as to say that it 's a majority, 
  huh , alright then . 
  thanks for the info .

  pay your debts , \u017di\u017eek !, 
  why are crazy people given space in newspapers ? 
  i can also write crazy stuff and blame x on y. 
  so this guy has a degree in philosophy , so what ? 
  does that make him an expert in financial crises ? 
  this guy is a self-admitted marxist , a follower of a theory that was proven wrong in the 19th century , only a decade after it was formed . 
  i 've noticed articles by \u017di\u017eek posted on / r/europe several times already . 
  why are people even paying attention to this charlatan ? 
  they 'll do it , if not now then in a couple of decades . 
  the generation that fought the wars in yugoslavia is now 40 years old , so another 30 years till they die , and perhaps serbia can join the eu . 
  where 's opera ? 
  in hungary a portion from your gross salary goes to healthcare , a portion goes to pension fund . 
  there are also options to send some of that money to a private healthcare or pension fund . 
  if you lose your job you may apply for social security and i 'm not sure how it works but i think you 'd get only 80 % of the minimum wage for no more than 12 months . 
  you would also need to pay for your own healthcare , which is around 20 euros/month . 
  if you do n't pay for healthcare you 'll still get free treatment at the doctor/hospital , but eventually you 'll get fined through taxes . 
  even if you 're employed , you wo n't pay for the healthcare benefits of your spouse . 
  she has to pay for herself in case she 's unemployed . 
  your children are covered until they finish university or begin to work . 
  also , a woman will get some benefits if she 's pregnant , it 's around 100 eur/month . 
  i 'd go with amsterdam because i hate northern cities due to the weather . 
  there was a danger of romania going `` yugoslav style '' and if i remember correctly the hungarian and romanian parties sat down and decided that it 's best to talk and settle things so they would avoid a bloody conflict . 
  this was in 1990 or 1991 , when the war already started in croatia , so everyone could see how horrible inter-ethnic conflict can be . 
  so you see at that time neither hungary or romania were in nato/eu etc. 
  and war was very much possible because there were wars everywhere in the former soviet block so it would n't be a big deal . 
  but it did n't happen . 
  why do you think anything like yugoslavia can happen now when both countries are in so many common organizations ? 
  you just do n't like hungarians , do you ? 
  just admit you 're a nationalist and you do n't care about valid argument so that i wo n't have to waste my time with you in the future . 
  yeah just like how the czech republic can put pressure on britain for oppressing its citizens living in the uk . 
  totally valid argument . 
  slovakia * right now * is discriminating its citizens , hungary complained to the eu , and the eu said it 's a sovereign matter . 
  how do you think hungary can put pressure on anyone if the eu wo n't even protect basic human rights ? 
  if you do n't like this news source then pick one of the other ones that are also reporting the same : * http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/130401/cyprus-did-president-urge-laws-withdraw-bank-deposits-bailout * http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/23036/52/ * http://news.gather.com/viewarticle.action?articleid=281474981865228 * http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/04/02/cyprus-controls-idindee93108r20130402 * http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2013/04/02/18734576.php * http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-rt-us-cyprus-bailoutbre9310dm-20130402,0,4643880.story and according to google there are 504 other news websites reporting the same thing . 
   as an anecdote , my 50-year old mother always brings up how the government gave young families interest-free loans on apartments , but she has nothing to say when i ask her if she thinks people right across the border in austria were homeless all this time since they did n't have the glorious party to give them housing . 
  my mother ( who was born and grew up in yugoslavia ) also says this same thing , how everyone got housing for free , while today the reality is there are many homeless people . 
  in this matter communism was indeed better than the current system . 
   49 % of romanians state that life before december 1989 was better in romania , while only 23 % think it was worst , and 14 % think it was the same . 
  is this serious ? 
  i was only 7 at the time but i do remember my parents talking about romanians like today we talk about north koreans . 
  no way people can seriously say it was better under ceausescu than now . 
  i do n't know much about the internal affairs of russia but i do remember 2 cases which proved that it 's not a democracy : 1 . 
  putin won in chechnya with 110 % of the votes 2 . exile.ru was shut down by the government regarding # 2 , they did n't silence them by arresting the editors and throwing them to jail , but by harassing their creditors . 
  they soon ran out of money and had to shut down . 
  you can read more about this [ on their website ] ( http://exile.ru/blog/detail.php?blog_id=19265&amp;author_id= ) . 
  it 's debatable if the slovak government had the right to bring a law which discriminates based on ethnicity 10 % of the population . 
  i do n't think it 's prevailing , perhaps the view is dominant among some old people . 
  their view is also biased because the system they lived in did n't provide for their old age , so if they live in a bad situation now they blame it on the current system , which is just stupid . 
  they had elk lasagna ? 
  all i could see is swedish meatballs . 
  are you romanian ? 
  does n't romania have this exact same law too , and is giving citizenship to moldavians ? 
  you should stay quiet , you 're embarrassing yourself . 
  more like , the socialist government did everything they could so that the hungarians outside the borders of hungary would not get citizenship . 
  the new citizens remember this very well , it has nothing to do with them being more/less nationalist . 
  s\u00e1rk\u00f6zy means something like `` area of mud '' , perhaps a swamp . 
  szark\u00f6zy would mean `` area of shit ''  so yeah , originally it 's pronounced sharkeuzee . 
  you can vote in the elections ? 
  the slovak law is special and is meant to target hungarians living in slovakia . 
  [ if you 're a slovak citizen living in the uk and you apply for british citizenship , you 're not going to lose your slovak citizenship ] ( http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/slovakia-hungary.8jz ) because you have a residency in the uk as well . 
  in case of hungarians living in slovakia , their only residency is in slovakia . 
  if they move over to hungary , establish residency and apply for citizenship , then they wo n't lose their citizenship . 
  this law was specifically introduced as a * response * to the hungarian citizenship law . 
  they introduced it i think only 24 hours after the law was voted in at the hungarian parliament . 
  what 's hypocritical and discriminatory in my opinion is that [ people with slovak ancestry * not * living in slovakia may still apply for permanent residency visa ] ( http://www.diyexpat.com/immigration/slovakia.html ) , which is just a stepping stone away from gaining slovak citizenship . 
  for example , there are ethnic slovaks living in serbia , and most of them have slovak citizenship since the 1990 ` es . 
  is n't it s\u00e1rk\u00f6zy ? 
  like i said , the logic is similar to turkish or indonesian , so they do n't have trouble understanding this . 
  it 's only weird if your native language is different . 
  i myself am fascinated by arabic , i tried learning it a bit but it 's just too different . 
  it 's more different than chinese is . 
  imagine a language with no words , just a series of patterns . 
  what i 'm trying to say is , the troika is n't some shadow organization of evil aristocratic bankers drinking champagne in their castle and laughing at poor people 's misery - yes there are probably some people like that in the crowd but there are also people like me who bought sovereign bonds for whatever reason . 
  we bought the bond , we knew the risk , that does n't mean we 'll just give up our money without a fight . 
  the troika is not pressuring greece because it wants power but because they are under pressure as well , for example by investors and the general public . 
  if they do n't represent my interests then there will be some consequences , i 'm not sure about all the details but the management of the imf can probably be sued for mishandling funds , and they might end up in jail . 
  the eu politicians would only suffer politically . 
  this all would n't have happened if they just let greece fail right at the start . 
  but once they loaned them money , they became liable for the return of that money . 
  like i said , i do n't hold greek bonds , but as part of the whole deal i did pay , like everyone else , around 500 euros through taxes that went to greece . 
  if that money does n't get returned then it means a lower level of development for me and my country ( spread out over a long period of time so it 's not noticeable but it 's nonetheless there , for example displayed by a road not being built ) . 
  but then it 's a question of whether we really need more development if the people in greece are suffering , and since the eu is supposed to be all about solidarity etc. 
  ben_je_gek said it perfectly . 
  you hijacked a really nice story with your nazi bullshit , and your posts will most likely be deleted once the mods wake up ( i 've reported your posts do n't worry ) . 
  like i said , take your nazi provocations to a subreddit that cares . 
  before the crisis every eurozone bond was of the same grade . 
  they can of course go bankrupt and suffer the consequences . 
  there 's also that scenario which is happening with argentina right now , where they went bankrupt in 2001 and then some vulture fund bought the worthless debt from the creditors and sued argentina at a us court . 
  now a decade later they demand the money back again + interest , if they do n't pay the us could freeze argentina 's assets in us banks which would cause another bankruptcy . 
  not sure how that will play out , but anyway that is another possible scenario if greece decides that it wo n't pay its debts . 
  the troika is just a bunny rabbit compared to vulture funds . 
   and why all this hate for greece ? 
  i love the macedonian people . 
  i do n't hate greeks , i hate people that offend macedonians . 
  just because you 're a moron it does n't mean i hate all greeks . 
  no i do n't hold greek bonds ( i never buy below-investment grade bonds ) . 
  but if i did own greek bonds , i would want my government to pressure greece to pay up its debts . 
  they live in a territory called macedonia .

  also extremely corrupt and with a humongous amount of red tape everywhere . 
  on this sub , yes . 
  the general population is probably not even aware of them , with the possible exception of the euro and schengen . 
  what does that sentence even mean ? 
  but what makes you think that the state being immigrated to ends up being broken ? 
  there are people immigrating to western europe for decades now , and those countries are most certainly not broken , and are still undoubtedly one of the best places on earth to live in . 
  i would even argue that japan is maybe the only advanced economy that does not have a significant amount of immigration , and their economy suffers because of it . 
  i have never said that . 
  i have n't followed remain campaign closely . 
  with that said , i am not aware of any lies they tried to push through , but the spotlight is not on them as they lost anyway . 
  maybe because they lied less ? 
  that paints a very sad picture about the uk 's political discourse . 
  he did introduce quite some uncertainty to their lives , though , by the campaign based on lies . 
  the booing is well deserved . 
  so you replaced certain money with a potential money that will only happen if barnett formula changes , which according to most people here from the uk is n't likely to happen . 
  also , you say most people are fine with losing that funding , but i wonder if they will still be fine when the effects of that loss start being felt . 
  but that will only happen a few years down the road of course . 
  that is simply not true . 
  there are way more common interests than there are divergences . 
  each country alone , europe is a bickering mess . 
  as a single market , it is a world power . 
  well they do make uk specific cars . 
  there are definitely vetoes when the issue is important enough . 
  for example , greece solely vetoes accession negotiations with macedonia for a whole decade now due to their naming dispute . 
  i really ca n't imagine ireland being overruled on something as important as this . 
  that last statement is very debatable . 
  ireland can simply veto any agreement that would introduce actual border . 
  eu negotiatiors know that . 
  why do you think the things would be cheaper in separate currencies ? 
  i do n't see why would this be . 
  that is really sad if true . 
  it 's the rules . 
  it 's a slippery slope if we stop following them . 
  do n't forget that over 48 % of people voted remain . 
  why not both ? 
  one does n't necessarily exclude the other, 
  `` instead of * together * with the french and germans . '', 
  i think you ca n't do the former without provoking a war with the owner of the said shore . 
  the latter , yes , fully agree . 
  does frontex have a mandate to do it ? 
   time to change some laws ... what would you propose as the solution ? 
  i was not aware of all that , thank you !, 
  fully agree to giving more powers to the parliament . 
  but are n't national governments the main blockers for this to happen ? 
  why getting rid of the commision rather than the council ? 
  those wars lasted for years and were merely stopped/contained , and not prevented . 
  inside the eu , there was a total of 0 days of armed conflict . 
  somehow pax americana stops working outside of the eu borders , though . 
  ok , come on . 
  `` between member states '' is what i should have used and what i meant , in the unlikely event that was n't clear . 
   it is clear though the eu needs to improve itself to become more democratic . 
  i hear this so often , but this is so much easier said than done ( even if it is true , which is debatable ) . 
  how would you go about it ? 
   it 's been barely week since the referendum actually , tomorrow it 's two weeks already . 
   what people do know is that remaining in the eu gets you nowhere yeah , just the longest period without wars on the continent , among other minor things . 
  no , it just means that this is a lose-lose situation for both uk and the eu . 
  same in serbia . 
  it 's complicated . 
  the eu ca n't officially request any recognition from us as long as it is not united on the matter . 
  yet , some deal will have to be reached before we join , that is for sure . 
  it is being worked on , but i do n't know if it will be enough . 
  there is still much animosity . 
  personally , i 'd like it if we 'd just recognize kosovo tomorrow and be done with it . 
  the fact is , though , it would not be fair or democratic towards the people in the north who overwhelmingly do n't want their towns to be in independent kosovo , but in serbia . 
  i feel your last paragraph is true even if the country is still a candidate . 
  getting a corrupted member inside the eu is a disservice to the bloc itself . 
  also , in countries like serbia and bulgaria , it is not the highest government officials that are the biggest problem , the problem is endemic corruption that is simply everywhere . 
  that takes a lot of will and pressure to solve . 
  romania is doing great recently , and making great strides in fighting corruption . 
  bulgaria , seemingly , less so . 
   nobody can successfully and effectively tackle corruption while being on the outside of the european union . 
  being legally bound to a supranational entity is what creates the necessary conditions to deal with high level corruption which typically resides near the top of the political hierarchy . 
  actually , the joining process itself can and should be used for that purpose as well i think . 
  once the country is in , the motivation becomes hard . 
  romania being the exception indeed . 
  i just hope serbia wo n't be admitted until we completely clean our act , starting with corruption and authocratic tendencies of the current government . 
  otherwise we will indeed be another bulgaria . 
  while i do agree , there is no reason that the negotiations be put on hold during the introspection time , as the joining process itself is incredibly useful for the country and it would be a real shame for that to stop . 
  plenty of time for introspection anyway , none of the balkan countries will be ready in the next 5 years at least . 
  italy will do no such thing , check the [ top comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4r83td/renzi_ready_to_defy_brussels_and_bail_out_italys/d4z0pjs ) . 
  at least here in twente my experience is completely different . 
  if you know how to program , you 'll get a job , companies are really looking hard for people . 
  in the netherlands the market is sorely lacking it personnel , and you can get along in english perfectly fine . 
  i would hope not indeed . 
  actually they sort of do it in china . 
  one does n't just move to beijing or shanghai . 
  i fully agree that is not the best solution , but what would you want them to do ? 
  open fire if the boat does n't start turning back ? 
   honestly the internet hurts my view of other europeans more than most other things/forms of media . 
  a lot of stereotypes become facts . 
  i 'd really like to hear some examples , i 'm curious . 
  my live experience is ( almost ) completely opposite . 
  it is a very good pr for the government to open negotiation chapters . 
  personally i would have liked it as well . 
  even if kosovo does prove to be a permanent blocker in the end , the negotiations themselves act as a very desirable monitoring and corrective process for our administration . 
  do you have working class in mind ? 
  everything currently points out that they will suffer the most from brexit . 
  = 4 years and 10 months . 
  and in the west even . 
  they are supposed to have their shit together .

country without military equipment , great beaches , communicative people and pretty much conservative . 
  well that 's called stupidity , they had to protest in that primitive way instead of just leaving the room . 
  they should be hooligans not politicians . 
  nazi salute ? 
  you 're so triggered , it 's kinda cute tho . 
  that was fair . 
  slovenia deserved it and yeah , finally a fair court decision . 
  not yet . 
  by whom ? 
  by everyone . 
  serbia would be the next syria . 
  superpowers would have indirect fight on serbian territory . 
  keep in mind that almost every country on balkans is in nato , except serbia , macedonia and bosnia , between these three countries russia has only interests in serbia . 
  `` the outcome would be more in our favour '' what the hell ? 
  serbia would be literally destroyed and there would be a lot of dead civilians . 
  greece land . 
  it 's pretty nice and warm there , definitely a good place to visit . 
  wait , they claim to be responsible for 30 % of victims ? 
  so their fault is death for about 300 victims . 
  lol whats up with that kekistan type flag ? 
  russians ? 
  lol, 
  do n't do things that you would n't like others do to you . 
  noup . 
  this time is just a conspiracy . 
  i 'd like to see him in turtle 's position, 
  yeaaah right sureee, 
  thanks for the correction i really appreciate it, 
  please speak english , this is / r/europe if you did n't noticed . 
  soros paid them to keep their mouths shut hehe, 
  nothing important . 
  terrible . . it 's a shame . 
  i am not saying that they were the only victims , but they also the victims . 
  actually serbia had nothing to do with war in croatia , people keep saying otherwise and it 's wrong . 
  croatian serbs started to get discriminated when tudjman got elected as a president , people started to get fired from their jobs and to get molested on the streets and boom . 
  oh dear , i remember kosovo , people going to defend their land , to fight terrorists , i 'm proud of them . 
  dear desireux do you know anything about jasenovac ? 
  they got killed by croats !, 
  no one is talking about that and no one is talking about burning monastery on kosovo , dead kids laying around without heads . 
  i am not saying that they were the only victims , but they also the victims .

  serbia is not a good guy here but croatia is n't too . 
  croatia keep denying ethnic cleansing and that 's the main problem here . 
  that was just for their safety , that was n't forced . 
  people who did n't evacuate and leave their home they were killed ( mostly old people and disabled ), 
  dude , they were charged in croatia , they have been like 2 days in jail and that 's it . 
  you need to go deeper in that . 
  44 dead civilians ? 
  haha , oh my god , i should n't laugh but this is so wrong . 
  they literally published their names and you still do n't believe ? 
  stop lying and acting like ethnic cleansing did n't happened . 
  the fact that battler were not lead in serbia does n't change anything . 
  so that 2500 + people who were killed are nothing to you , just propaganda ? 
  croats peacefully entered villages and polite asked people to leave ? 
  oh dude , you got serious problem in your head if you believe in that . 
  we will never forget 200 000 serbs who were forced to leave their home and more than 2500 dead serbian civilians . 
  say whatever you want , you ca n't deny the facts . 
  oh , we got one butthurt fella here !, 
  you 're wrong , actually only a few people were punished , but the rest did n't , for example take gotovina . 
  first , get your facts together and then comment you uneducated prick . 
  we need justice . . 
  is this that chick who posted picture on twitter that glory bombing and killing innocent people in serbia ? 
  good job morons , they should be in jail by now . 
  throwback to the good old days, 
  europe is my country . 
  we 're waiting for you !, 
  beautiful country . 
  she has that sad face , kinda make me sad too . 
  actually they stole what they wanted from mexico ( texas ... ), 
  i wo n't tell you , that 's secret . 
  just extradite him and let the justice do the rest . 
  he would be isolated . 
  too soft move . 
  it would be funny if russia put its troops on mexican-us border, 
  of course it should n't be left ignored , but that 's not job for one individual , it should be removed by some authorities, 
  it 's just wasting time . 
  she could do better things instead , maybe start visiting orphanages and talk to kids and help them understand nazism, 
  stupid thing to do . 
  always hated to see that . 
  pretty much saying bunch of stupid stuff like he always do and wiping vucic 's ass . 
  he probably yelled `` long life jesus '', 
  man , i 'm going to write my side of the story and my view of everything , especially about bosnia . 
  serbs are guilty as much as others . 
  there was one guy named arkan , who went to war just to steal and kill , not alone , but with his group of people . 
  in my opinion he deserved to be killed . 
  but , let 's be real , he was n't the only one , there were people like him on both sides . 
  sarajevo used to be multi - ethnic city where all people used to live together without any problems ( serbs , croats , bosniaks ) and when the stupid , very very stupid politicians started to motivate people to kill each other everything has changed . 
  i blame them . 
  without them people wo n't do such things to each other . 
  and the thing i said about arabs in bosnia , yeah , now if you go to sarajevo there are bunch of arabs who are ruling the city . 
  there is no sarajlija anymore . 
  here , in serbia people love russia and russia does n't give a fuck about serbia . 
  ` beograd na vodi ' is another stupid decision of our corrupted government which will end unfinished . 
  i 'm just tired of seeing everyone talk shit about serbia and serbian victims , it 's like they are not important , every victim is important and we shall not give any nationalist any power if we do that we are going to lay in blood again . 
  i talked about sarajevo because my neighbour was from there and we used to discuss about that .

  if yes , then the current article 14 is good for fooling the dumb masses , but in reality serbia agrees to let kosovo join any organization that are a precondition to the eu . 
  why would you agree to that ? 
  i bet it was / u/radegar , he seemed nervous the other day . 
  thaci says that it was agreed to let kosovo join the un . 
  is this true ? 
  without wanting to spoil the fun for everyone : it 's not over till both parliaments ratify the agreement . 
  2013 : when all of those people were dead . 
  good choice , hitler was a patriot too . 
  no wonder you support mass deportation of other ethnicities . 
  best thread ever !, 
  does this mean our gdp is actually 22 % larger than it is officially stated ? 
  are you saying you 're not a nationalist ? 
  hahaha czech nationalists are so silly , 
  hmm yeah it 's possible that i 'm wrong . 
  i 'm using the slovenian layout for latinic letters . 
  i know , my point is that saying `` the germans deserved it cause they voted for the nazis '' is not the right argument to explain why they got ethnically cleansed from the sudetenland . 
  the right argument is saying they lost the war . 
  to be honest , they could 've just given sudetenland to germany after ww2 , that would 've solved the conflict as well . 
  for serbia it 's wrong , it should be qwerty + non-latin , not qwertz + non-latin . 
  [ brutal assault ] ( http://brutalassault.cz/en/ ) , you can see the weirdest people in europe all in one place, 
  `` what are the big stories in your country '' threads . 
  there were a few posted lately , it makes me think someone is doing some research or homework . 
  i did notice lately someone ( probably you ) posting these threads . 
  what 's the point of it ? 
  cool , you guys have jihadists, 
  i remember a couple of years ago i planned to take a shortcut and enter serbia from osijek . 
  at the time i would arrive there would be no buses , i looked at the map , saw that it 's only 10 km to the border and thought `` oh well , i 'll walk '' . 
  my friend looked at me and said `` are you crazy ? 
  there are minefields everywhere ! '', 
  as someone who was used to hitchhiking and sleeping at strangers ' places this was definitely a new kind of experience , something you do n't see in american movies like into the wild , 
  the major highway connecting serbia with greece ( and the port of thessaloniki ) goes through bujanovac , one of those bordering cities . 
  it would be economic suicide to give that up . 
  fucking cagots , i hate them so much, 
  this guy knows what he 's talking about . 
  it 's really tiresome listening to all the pessimist complaining about doom and gloom . 
  the eu economy has been doing great for 2 years and the best times are still to come !, 
  i do n't agree with the serb pm . 
  kosovo has the upper hand here , why would they ever give up a land rich in minerals ? 
  i do n't like cabbages but there is some truth in what you 're saying . 
  i 've heard people say cabbages are a national meal here . 
  as an atheist neckbeard i believe the government should do something against the genocide of neckbeards that is currently underway, 
  hooray !, 
  borrowed money !, 
  according to wikipedia it 's 13 % , which is more than romania ( 9 % ), 
  south of sava = balkans, 
  yeah but you 're a student , i 've got a family to support . 
  imagine if 10 years from now you still spend 70 % of your income on a rent , how will you buy diapers for your kid ? 
  with that being said i now spend 20 % of my income on rent , but i had to work a lot to reach that . 
   i 'm talking about no cheaper accommodation in the whole country , you said  unless you go find yourself some flat in some village in the countryside i know that luxemburg is small so perhaps you do n't have a countryside , i really would n't know , but you should n't contradict yourself . 
   by your description , i have low quality as i 'm paying 1100 $ rent ( ~ 82m \u00b2 with utilities ) on a household income of ~ 2500 $ with two persons , myself being a full-time student . 
  yep , that sounds like low quality life to me . 
  how will you ever afford to buy your own home if half of your income ends up in someone elses pocket ? 
  also , the period i mentioned living in that 19m ^ 2 apartment , i was n't a student anymore . 
  when i was a student i was making 350 euros/month and was living with my parents . 
  right now * you * as a student are having the quality of life that a junior professional with a degree has in eastern europe . 
  i do n't think you understood . 
  there is also no cheaper accomodation in ljubljana . 
  me specifically i lived in a 19m ^ 2 studio , in a building filled with immigrant laborers , covered muslim women and children that do n't speak the local language , and paid 350 euros/month and my net salary was 1000 euros . 
  in my opinion your life becomes low quality if you pay more than 1/3 of your salary on the rent . 
  that 's what 30m ^ 2 studios cost in ljubljana , slovenia . 
  where the income is less than in luxemburg . 
  philosophers and sociologists are not on the list :(, 
  it 's disgusting how people treat her . 
  there 's an unwritten rule that you should say only good things about the deceised during the funeral . 
  if you 've got nothing good to say then keep quiet . 
  the british society is degenerate if they behave this way . 
   i do n't see how kosovo would work as an independent country maybe it should join albania ? 
  they should take your advice and have a referendum , i wonder how many % will vote yes , 
   start respecting people who were defending your ass hahahahahahahahahahaha if you are not a troll i do n't know what are you . 
  people like you do n't know how to speak english or write with latin alphabet , so i do n't think you 're real . 
  this is an eastern european country , it does n't need to do austerity because the government is not as bloated as western european countries are . 
  the problem with slovenia is that they rejected attempts by foreign banks to buy their largest domestic banks , those banks now got into trouble and there are no multinational banks to fill them with their cash . 
  instead , the population will have to fill them up . 
  til there are hungarians in kosovo, 
  i was hoping that vucic is the guy who realized this ( how you feel , not the average serb ) and would go ahead and finish the kosovo story . 
  i do n't know , maybe he got the latest polls and it showed him it would not be good for his ratings , so he went against it ? 
  his behavior disappointed me ... you know , i did n't think anything but the worst about him based on his past , but last year he arrested all those people and i thought hmm maybe there 's hope in him yet ... and then he fucks it all up by yelling at a meeting with catherine ashton . 
  just how primitive can you be to yell at a meeting with the eu ? 
  you know , these people are all cultured people , listening to opera , driving electric cars and having gay parents . 
  you ca n't treat them like this , you 'll hurt their feelings !, 
  it 's without doubt now that the eu joining date wo n't happen anymore under the current government , so i 'm not sure what else can they do for the remaining 3 years . 
  better to just have elections now ... ... and i 'll say another , perhaps stupid thing . 
  i think that , if dacic wins the next elections and his party becomes the strongest , that dacic will recognize kosovo 's independence and be done with this agony . 
  not because he has strong will or because he 's some genius who know 's what 's best for serbia . 
  i think it 's maybe because he 's drunk all the time . 
  i think that , had only dacic went to the meeting last week , without vucic , that he would 've signed the agreement . 
  perhaps because catherine ashton would 've supplied him with a never-ending stream of whiskey . 
  he would 've signed it and it would be in the long run good for serbia . 
  but then that asshole vucic turned up and ruined anything . 
  i would like dacic to win the next elections so that he would be drunk 24/7 and just agree to everything the eu says , then perhaps this hellhole of a country can finally move in the right direction for the first time in 20 years . 
  i know how the average serb thinks and it does n't really matter , the reality is serbia is becoming a worst place to live every year , and it 's because of the politics of always delaying and opposing the eu . 
  it 's really time to start not opposing the eu . 
  let 's try it out and see what happens . 
  he 's not even a well-known philosopher . 
  if i would go full-nerd-mode i 'd say that the paper his theories are printed on are n't worthy to wipe anthony gidden 's ass . 
  or habermas ' . 
  for those not familiar with the subject , these three are the most recognized and most influential people in modern sociology . 
  and not surprisingly , these three have a completely opposing view of the eu to \u017di\u017eek . 
  most likely cause they 're not demented yugo-nostalgic retards . 
  it 's really sad that nowadays everyone can be a professor .

  of course not , our overseas friends imported ` freedom ' to us , with the help of domestic idiots . 
  and no , i 'm not a conspiracy theorist , in the last few weeks cia was removing ` top secrect ' labels from their documents on yugoslavian war , in those documents you can clearly see how they controlled the course of war , it was all over the news here , if you are interested i can find it .

  conclusion : our fathers were jealous fuckers that did n't give us food when we were young :(, 
  i am the only guy i know who is shorter than his father d : i 'm 178cm and he is 182 . 
   i do n't think the people of the us or britain ( or france - do n't forget about them ) would tolerate any sort of protracted conflict that involved anything more than a few limited missile strikes . 
  of course you would n't tolerate that , i know that 95 % of people everywhere hate war , no matter the color of the skin or nationality . 
  and that 's why your governments lie to you . 
  i witnessed it personally - 1999 nato bombing of serbia . 
  it lasted for few months , and nato told you that they were helping albanians on kosovo . 
  and how they helped them ? 
  by boming the shit out of serbia , i live in a second largest serbian city and i remember that like it was yesterday , when they bombed my civilian neighborhood with [ cluster munition ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cluster_munition#yugoslavia.2c_1999 ) in the middle of the day with all the people and children running around . 
  lol . 
  i hope that at least people of britain/us do n't believe bullshit from their government . 
  and i hope that they do n't think that britain/us would go to war just to ` help ' poor syrians . 
  wtf you have \u0161 and \u017e too ?

  so when you see a word , let 's say `` ku\u0107a '' ( house ) , you just say the ` sound ' of each letter , and you are done , you read it properly .

  it was pretty popular here , too ... 
  i remember i somehow felt sad when i watched it as a kid , it had some crazy stuff and kinda mature content with that hitler crow and shit like that . 
  edit : wut again , is his name really alfred ** jodocus ** kwak ? 
  because in serbian dub they called him alfred ** jonathan ** kwak :d, 
  til i am in the 53 % and i am the 87 % . 
  here is why only 53 % of the serbians support eu : step 1 ) eu sets some conditions to our politicians , they give them actual work that needs to be done . 
  step 2 ) our politicians do n't do it , or do it sloppy , or take million years to do it . 
  step 3 ) eu responds to that with negative actions . 
  step 4 ) politicians do n't blame the eu directly , but they keep reassuring the people how they did everything correctly , how they tried their best , and how it 's really strange that eu gave them negative answers . 
  rinse and repeat . 
  so now average serbian thinks : `` fuck eu , all they to do is constantly make some requirements and give us crazy tasks , once we do that , they respond with more terms , we do n't need eu , they obviously hate us . '', 
  aaaand now i wan na play sim city , but i am sad that sim city 5 is shit and i played too much sim city 4 that it bored me fuck #firstworldproblems .

  \u00a1 genial !, 
  i know about that emperor ( or was he king ) mindaugas and i know that vilnius is capital and i know that i always loved to watch serbia ( yugoslavia ) - lithuania basketball matches . 
  most electronic devices are cheaper in us , not just the ps4 . 
  why ? 
  i guess it 's because of taxes .

  except that they do n't ... 
  it 's the best food in the world, 
  is this a restaurant for millionaires ? 
   nope , it was n't top priority , no clue where did you find that information . 
  they brought the law 1 day after removing yanukovich from power . 
  do you see the `` occupied '' people protesting against the `` occupation '' ? 
  where did they find this idiot moderator ? 
  `` despite his accent , he 's the president of estonia '' ? 
  you were n't born and raised in europe so your mentality is as foreign as that of a vietnamese national . 
  instead of meddling in our affairs you should look into going back to your country , founded on genocide by convicts . 
  you 're not one of us , jeff , and you never will be , no matter how long you claim you 've been in europe . 
  and quoting an american source does n't prove shit in this case . 
  exactly , too bad we ca n't have a un resolution condemning israel , because the us will veto it . 
  i agree with you , the eu should do more to stop israel violating human rights . 
  the palestinians are the victims in this conflict . 
  those assholes should be court marshalled !, 
  i just hate injustice and hope an independent palestine will be a reality soon . 
  i actually agree with you , we should impose sanctions on israel and their friends in washington . 
  the eu and japan built that airport for the peaceful palestinians and the israelis bombed it to the ground . 
  i think that 's enough proof . 
  i hope israel returns the territory it stole from the palestinians and then repays all the damage it has done . 
  it happened due to israeli provocations and the oppression of the palestinian people . 
  am i right ? 
  thanks for that article , to sum it up : israel attacked palestinian civilian infrastructure for no reason at all . 
  that 's the israeli logic for you ... some people just do n't make sense . 
  i agree , the eu should do something to stop israel violating human rights . 
  i do n't understand why is the world tolerating this !, 
  we should impose sanctions on israel and recognize an independent palestine asap !, 
  i wonder how will this reflect on the russians living in the baltic states . 
  afaik they were also stripped of their citizenship since they did n't take the language test ... 
  this is a bad idea , somebody might send offensive postcards or pictures of penises . 
  no , i 'm angry because relevant news is getting downvoted in this forum , which means it 's not the best medium to follow the news . 
  one attraction of reddit is that you can get news faster than any other website . 
  if my posts are getting downvoted this way , then it 's happening to others as well . 
  [ meta ] [ i posted this same news a day ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20tzvm/ukrainan_mps_assault_and_physically_force_the/ ) and it got downvoted into invisibility . 
  it 's disgusting what this forum has turned into .

  your general attitude and your post history shows it, 
  you seem to have a really sad obsession disparaging russia , too bad you know so little about the region .

  it 's been posted on this forum at least 693921760003356331 times,

   however considering possible `` iranian '' sanctions against russia ( prohibition of `` luxury '' export into the country - including cars ) i wonder how will this affect serbia 's economy . 
  i think exporting cars to russia is one of the big parts of the gdp , and it comes from the fiat factory . 
  although serbia is not part of the eu , fiat is an italian company , so who knows ... 
  well i expected a more interesting presentation :(, 
  nice but useless , unfortunately . 
  the epp is the largest party in the eu parliament while here it came out 4th , so based on that these results can not be used for any useful extrapolation . 
  yes i think it 's probably the rural areas . 
  in budapest it 's suicide to drive a bicycle . 
  that 's the point . 
  i was replying to suicidemachine 's comment about how the nato war games are justified because poland is afraid russia will attack . 
  when in fact there 's 0 chance that 's going to happen . 
   which is worse than someone close to an ex-kgb spy close to a neighbouring militaristic , authoritarian country how ? 
  the kgb spy was elected , the nazi thug got his chair through violence . 
  that 's basically my answer to the rest of your comments . 
  these people are * worse * than the old government in that the old guys won the elections fair and square , the new guys only manage to come to power through force . 
  and btw . 
  these `` new '' guys previously came to power through the orange revolution , another violent affair . 
  they never managed to win democratically . 
  which sets the question , if these guys lose the elections again in 2018 , and a yanukovich-party guy comes back to power , then will there be another `` revolution '' in 2022 ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances  the memorandum was originally signed by three nuclear-powers , the russian federation , the united states of america , and the united kingdom . 
  china and france later gave individual statements of assurance as well these are the states which should matter in this case, 
  can swiss citizens come and work in the eu without being restricted by any quotas ? 
   the only one who was placed in power by an angry mob read this article please , it 's fascinating . 
  tells you just who exactly got the power : http://www.novinite.com/articles/158543/kyiv+post%3a+the+not-so-revolutionary+new+ukraine+government  his appointment is frowned upon as it 's considered one of the `` rewards '' to maidan activists . 
   one of his legal initiatives was an attempt to ban all abortions , even for pregnancies that occurred during rape  she financed restoration of radomysl , a small castle in zhytomyr oblast , but had been accused of illegally taking over it . 
   he is disliked by many local diplomats for his arrogance . 
   was under criminal investigation  formerly an investigative journalist , she ran for parliament in 2012 and lost . 
  and lots more ... edit : i 'm getting downvoted for providing a source to an opposing view ? 
  the elections will be in may , until then we have a nazi simpathiser running the justice ministry and the greatest oponents to yanukovich in charge of the whole government . 
  in a corrupted country like ukraine do you think these people will leave any chance of them not winning the elections ? 
  do you think criminals like yulia timoshenko will want to get back to prison , or will they fight tooth and nail to not return there ? 
  elections were agreed between yanukovich and the protesters . 
  it was all going fine . 
  then the violent mob took over and overthrew the government . 
  everything they 've done after that is illegal . 
  i hate lazy trolls like you . 
  you 're interested in facts but you ca n't visit the fucking websites yourself ?

  do you trust the bbc ?

  do you trust the ny times ? 
  this is all western media so of course it 's slightly skewed against russia , but you can get the facts between the lines . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/world/europe/ukrainian-officials-in-east-move-to-blunt-pro-russia-forces.html really you only need like 5 minutes of googling to find all this . 
  the legally elected president was elected by the majority of the people . 
  in a modern democracy that means the majority in general agrees with his actions .

  these are new ones , the ones they used in serbia had little orange parachutes and detonated either on impact or had a delayed timer . 
  if i recall correctly , the main problem we had with them was little kids in the country side playing around and seeing a nice little parachute on the ground , and then they died . 
  they were essentially like air-deployed land mines .

   they are either high , trolling or stupid . 
  i like how you consider me to be a multiple entity, 
  pretty sure it 's the other way around . 
  also , i 'd like to see a source for your outrageous claim . 
  you ca n't count to 0 , it 's impossible . 
  they 're doing their best , but serbia is an enormous country ( our border with hungary is twice the circumference of the us ) , so some will slip by . 
  lol , not our border police , that 's for sure . 
  nah , the biggest head is neatly snuggled in my underpants , fixed firmly to the top of my dick .

  i am a right-wing nationalist , and will therefore provide a voice of reason . 
  definitely greece, 
  not much work though - you see a blip for a couple of seconds - you know where it appeared , you know where it disappeared , you therefore know the direction and velocity . 
  you also know the altitude , and you 've got all the components you need to pinpoint the location - but since you 're a serb and do n't need to run any calculations , because maths is for catholics and homosexuals , you simply point your rocket in the general vicinity of where you think the aircraft may be , and pull the trigger . 
  you now cross your fingers and pray to the one and only eastern-orthodox variant of jesus and his daddy , and since everyone knows god is a serb , the +100 luck buff is applied , the missile connects , and the aircraft is shot down . 
  easy peasy , i do n't see why you 're making such a big deal out of it . 
  not sure about that , from what i heard , the f117 can be seen briefly when off-loading missiles/fuel tanks , which is how they may have seen him . 
  they saw it briefly on the radar , deduced the altitude/direction in which it was going , and set off a heat seeker in the general vicinity hoping it would lock - which it did . 
  an educated guess , more or less . 
  eh , maybe not a helicopter . 
  that 's a hungarian variant , they 're famous for their feta . 
  two replies on one comment - i 'm keeping an eye on you & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  you seem to be forgetting that all lands in the proximity of the serbian border are actually serbian lands which were taken from us by the us/eu/nato / vatican/zionist/illuminati usurpers . 
  this places 100 % of the shopluk region in serbian territories , hence the other name for shopska salad - the serbian salad . 
  except the shopska salad , which is clearly serbian . 
  no , greek salad uses feta instead , and has olives . 
  because the bulgarians are trying to steal our fucking salad, 
  we removed kebab , but could not remove the influence . 
  of course not , we 're racist . 
  even our gypsies do n't eat poultry , they say it 's beneath them . 
  nigga come to serbia we roast anything that moves especially pigs , but not suckling pigs , because we 're not genocidal murderers like you italians and have actual feelings . 
  we let the suckling grow from 5 kg to 20kg , then we kill it and roast it and eat it . 
  we also roast cows , bulls , goats , sheep . 
  pretty much anything above the 15kg mass and minimum 4 legs threshold . 
  just look at [ this little fucker ] ( http://static.telegraf.rs/2013/01/07/prase.jpg ) , he 's so happy . 
   we 're they that good in fighting ? 
  when the jna was retreating , they may have left some equipment behind . 
  hey jules, 
  kebab hatred is really more of a frame of mind rather than an explicit rule for muslim removal . 
  serbia is a tolerant and egalitarian society , the kebab are not strictly turks or bosnians , but everyone who is n't serbian , and all are hated equally , for we are not a people who discriminate based on gender , or religion , or sexual preferences , but only based on nationality . 
   speared not yet , but soon my friend ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  we attack you because you 're a neighbouring country , wtf kind of question is that bulgaria ? 
  we have tomorrow and tuesday off . 
  if a public holiday falls on sunday , it 's moved to monday . 
  that has nothing to do with loose gun laws - those weapons were incredibly abundant during the war , most people were armed ( again due to the war ) , and when the war ended , most people buried their guns in anticipation for the next war . 
  others sold them on the black market because it 's a shame to throw away a fully functioning ak . 
  same goes with hand grenades , however these are usually dug up by children later on because unlike an assault rifle , the hand grenades are more fun sized and make a boom . 
  you can also play catch with them , juggle them , and even discard them to your nearest trash bin when you get all tuckered out from playing catch . 
  this is simple stuff , i do n't understand your confusion . 
  loose gun laws ? 
  wtf u on about ? 
  our gun laws are as strict , if not stricter than in most pussy ass eu cuntries . 
  wait , they 're filming ep8 in dubrovnik ? 
  i know bby, 
  orcs are n't natives to balkans m8, 
  says the ex-mod of / r/serbia, 
  same way you view serbian agression in croatia . 
  it 's hard to justify shit when bombs are falling from the sky and sirens blaring on a daily basis . 
  well with all the guns , and no abortions , i thought you confused poland with alabama or some shit . 
  can you get abortions in poland ? 
  wait , so you can buy a fully auto ak legally , and are then required by law to lock it at semi-auto , or the shop does this for you ?

  hungary successfully managed to defend its own border , so it 's sad when you see rich greeks complaining about not receiving blankets from hungary . 
   merkel is so soft on foreign policy that i ca n't see any consequence opposing her on such an issue . 
  in the past 5 years , what major event happened within the eu that went against merkel 's wishes ? 
  i specifically remember the greek pm complaining how the germans bullied him into accepting the eu terms . 
  sure you are , croatia . 
  lol your source is index . 
  no further comments are needed . 
  you and i live in a different world , and your world is luckily the minority in hungary . 
  that 's not true at all . 
  most people i know are very happy about our performance . 
  my facebook feed is full of posts about `` yet another gold medal b ) '' . 
  turn on any of the government tv stations and you can see every 30 mins a propaganda clip about how we 're the best . 
  on m1 tv there is a medal counter showing the number of medals we 've won , and it 's on all the time , regardless of the program . 
  are you sure you live in hungary ? 
   it is kind of hypocritical to slam middle and western europe for paying people from the middle east when a lot of the money goes to nationals of easten europe . 
  it is not hypocritical because * we * , eastern and western europe , are citizens of the european union . 
  we take care of our own people . 
  we pay the taxes to do that . 
  our ancestors have worked on building the structure which holds the eu together now . 
  our parents voted for the political parties in power in the past decades with the idea that in the future , their children will live in a better place . 
  they did not vote so that illegal immigrants would live in a better place . 
  yes , it 's a great idea and yes they should be supported , but they should always come 2nd after the actual eu citizens . 
  the citizens of eastern europe should always come first , not the refugees from the middle east . 
  is this really so difficult to understand ? 
  yes , currently ee gets more money than it pays in the common treasury . 
  however in 2007 slovenia became the first ee country to actually pay more than it receives ( later this changed due to the economic crisis ) . 
  that is the goal of all countries and in 5-25 years ee countries will reach the eu median and they will pay as much as they receive . 
  behaving arrogantly because now they receive more than they pay will not help eu unity . 
   the fact that hungary does not pay their citicens fair social benefits is a problem , i agree in that . 
  it 's not a problem . 
  the citizens agree with that . 
  this is why they voted for the party which enacted those laws . 
  your idea of what social benefits should be is not universal , that 's my point . 
  and receiving money is not a human right . 
  if people in pakistan can earn a living ( and they can ) then they can not just come to the eu and demand benefits . 
   well , the argument of the european court of human rights to stop dublin was human rights breaches in the hungarian camps . 
  what human rights breaches ? 
  what has been * proven * ? 
   also , the decline of the free press in hungary , the deterioration of the right of a fair trial by basically disempowering the constitutional courts . 
  this is all true , but how does it affect the refugees ? 
  what do they care if the hungarian free press gets squashed ? 
  or the constitutional court ? 
   first : if you would have looked at the island , it actually belongs to tunesia , so no european power to create something like you proposed there . 
  the island where australia ships its immigrants is also not australian , it actually belongs to nauru : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nauru_regional_processing_centre are you even familiar with this issue ? 
  i 'm saying that the eu should do exactly what australia does and deport to a tunisian island exactly because then the eu would not be legally responsible for those people . 
  and if those people know that the eu is not legally responsible for them , then they will not come at all . 
  that 's the whole point . 
   second : from the scale , i would say it ca n't be bigger than 10 km \u00b2 . 
  nauru is 21 km ^ 2 and the refugee detention center takes only part of the island . 
  i 'm sure there are many islands out there . 
  hmm , how about this one ? 
  your post shows exactly what people in ee think the people in we think about ee . 
  you are telling us how shitty we are while you yourself ca n't fix the problem either . 
   the main criminal-problems of 2015 ... are sinti and roma that came over to germany ... because the eastern european nations are not able to handle their problem you now have the chance to show the eastern european nations how the problem should be handled . 
  france solved it by deporting roma migrants back to romania . 
  what is germany 's solution ? 
  how will you integrate people that did not integrate for centuries ( while everyone else did ) ? 
   as long as we declare the human rights as the main element of european values , these benefits have to be payed . 
  they have to be paid to european citizens , not to everyone that steps across the eu 's borders . 
  let me tell you about hungary 's social benefits system . 
  if you get fired , you need to pay your own medical expenses ( around 20 eur/month ) until you find an employer . 
  you also do n't really get unemployment benefits . 
  i 've read somewhere that you do , but from my experience that 's not true . 
  so it really does n't pay to be unemployed in hungary . 
  why would anyone want to come here ? 
  unless he/she planned to actually work and pay taxes . 
  so when you say `` benefits have to be paid '' , you 're not talking about the eu in general , you 're talking about western europe or germany in particular . 
  the eu benefits are not uniform , which is why some parts are attractive to migrants , while others are n't . 
   that the eastern european nations give a fuck about human rights is nothing new , just look at what happens in hungary and start to happen in poland . 
  what happens now in hungary is mostly corruption , but i do n't know what you 're talking about when it comes to human rights . 
  which human rights were abused recently ? 
  please do n't mention the 2008 shooting of roma people , that was 8 years ago , the people were tried and convicted , and is not a recent event . 
  my question is , how is hungary/poland worse than germany when it comes to human rights ? 
  sorry but no . 
  the syrians who came to europe last year are mostly pakistani and afghani economic migrants . 
  this needs to be understood before anything , because if you 're argument is that they are defenseless women and children then there 's nothing to discuss here . 
  the people from kongo and pakistan are the same category of people , and they only come because of the drowing power of ( western ) europe . 
  you just need to remove that factor and the problem is solved . 
  put them on an island outside of the eu , like australia did and for those that are already inside : 1 . 
  strict criteria on family unification , for example the main applicant needs to work legally for 5 years before he can apply for his spouse and children 2 . 
  they need to find work and make progress in learning the local language , otherwise they get shipped to the island outside the eu the question of rescuing the people in the boats is valid , but the current situation is the italian coastal guard is patroling the lybian coast and rescuing people 50 km from lybia , instead of 50 km from italy . 
   the only final solution to end the influx of refugees has nothing to do with the european border , but with the situation in the middle east . 
  how will `` fixing '' the middle east stop people from kongo trying to come to europe ? 
  you are delusional in thinking the problem is not within the eu itself . 
  has it really been that long that you ca n't remember last year 's events ? 
  `` the muslims '' do n't want to go to eastern europe , they want to go to germany . 
  redistributing them to ee means forcing those people to go to countries they do n't want to go . 
  hungary tried to keep them in camps and was criticized by everyone in the eu for being fascist evil nazis . 
  the migrants are aware of the political in-fighting in europe and they were aware that hungary was getting bashed for doing its job . 
  this is why they dared to break out of the camps , walk on highways , fight with police , throw women on the rail tracks in front of cameras and holding the 1 % women and children up high for the cameras . 
  had hungary been supported by others in the eu , those people would not have come at all and would 've likely stayed in afghanistan and pakistan because they 'd know they could n't cry their way to germany . 
  private citizens from austria came with their cars to budapest to rescue the poor migrants . 
   the turkey-deal was the only way that the blockading-strategy of the balkan did n't turn into a bloody civil / refugee war on the border of greece in order to get to europe . 
  the migrants stopped coming when the wall was erected on the macedonia-greece border . 
  coincidentally this was the same moment when the turkey-deal was reached . 
  if the deal with turkey is cancelled , the wall in macedonia will stay . 
  it will work , of course , only if the eu helps macedonia defend its border . 
  also note that the migrants are not coming to europe because of the drawing power of hungary or poland . 
  they come because of germany and sweden etc. 
  eastern europe is not the problem here , the problem are the social benefits western europe hands out to everyone .

  you want to talk about bias ? 
  this sub is literally like r/russia but with pro-american and anti-russian positions sometimes . 
  i 'll continue calling it out when i see it . 
  r/socialism is just a sub about socialism, 
  i notice the opposite every time i say something critical of america , and in most cases including this thread it 's not whataboutism it 's just critique as i do n't support russia , i get hit with the downvotes and the same idiots trying to `` whatabaout serbia ! '', 
  to silence me and steer the discussion away from america 's crimes . 
  funny how all of you rabid anti-russians will revert to soviet rhetoric the moment it fits you . 
  this sub is disgustingly pro-american foreign policy , i feel like i 'm reading the fucking national review are you an american transplant ? 
  obama shill ? 
  what gives ? 
  usually romanians are n't this blind, 
  lmaoooo cant believe people support this jingoistic american bullshit always butting into any criticism of america with `` but what about your crimes xd '' our criminals were thankfully all tried and convicted while theirs still run the government like they have for the past 200 years carefully awaiting more sarcastic dismissal with a good measure of genocide jokes  ) ) ), 
  thing is we or our neighbours have n't done such a thing in 20 + years and all the guilty have been convicted and tried . 
  meanwhile cheney et co are not in prison , are they ? 
  good analysis , thank you for commenting, 
  america only invades browns so who cares, 
  it 's a question of changing mentalities too , if the only way russians can identify with russia is with its imperialism then that is a bad thing . 
  i do n't expect it to happen anytime soon , but as a goal i think it 's what the eu should strive towards . 
  a federal eu would be , iirc , at least the second strongest and richest country on earth , if not the first . 
  here 's a thought , how about an independent europe independent from both american and russian political influence, 
  how do they view them differently unless you 're talking about people conflating arabs or darker-skinned individuals with muslims i 've just never heard of anyone saying anything along the lines of `` these white muslims can be salvaged but these brown muslims ca n't '', 
  lmao keep fighting the good fight neizzyfunk, 
  really no need for / s, 
  well i do n't know what happened with those soviet mars landings but i just wanted to clarify that not landing = / = not scientific success in any case i support both russians and americans getting butthurt about who has the best space program because that 's what led to the space race , so continue provoking pls, 
   fucked it up that 's not how science works man ... 
  listen to serbete and to you is before grandfather ? 
  as far as i can go w/o google translate lmao, 
   that 's why people think white muslims can be `` saved/salvaged '' while brown muslims should be deported . 
  who thinks this, 
  watch this ... 
  i think both are ok for any reason, 
  your parents ( or you , depending on how old you are ) lived in a socialist country that was n't totalitarian and that most citizens enjoyed . 
  you * must * be aware of this , that not all communism results in the same thing . 
  what 's the point of bringing north korea , a semi-feudal dictatorship , into it . 
  i do n't know , while nice and sarcastic that quip is pretty demeaning towards manual laborers, 
  haha fuck you guys are killing me how the fuck are all comments in bulgarian lmao, 
  lot of interesting hairstyles in russia, 
  true , but that 's a slight against ottoman imperialism not serbia . 
  i mean it 's just one example but it 's undeniable that the parts of modern-day serbia with the best urbanism are the ones that were under austrian rule . 
  pretty dumb to fight over which empire ruled us was better ... but do n't tell me you actually identify with austria-hungary ? 
  that 's pretty revisionist , [ pic related ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xhnq4p1.png ) . 
  hopefully you know a non-negligible number of croats were highly opposed to austrian rule . 
  a lot of the early pan-slavists , yugoslavists , and members of the illyrian movement were croats . 
  i guess i 'm just curious as to what your real positions are . 
  do you actually really believe in `` gothic croats '' and `` aryans '' and all that , or is it just memes ? 
   diaspora balkanites are the worst and they all get on my nerves , they 're all super-uber-nationalistic  panonia lmao your most recent comment is calling serbia `` uncivilized eastern neighbors '' get over yourself boy i do n't get you man sometimes you make sense ( like in this comment ) other times you act like a nationalistic troglodyte , the same ones you 're calling out now, 
  ou bellicisme, 
   identity has to be built on a uniform language . 
  that 's certainly a very important part of it . 
  in yugoslavia after the war in the 90s the different dialects of serbo-croatian were highly politicized and attempts to distance the 100 % mutually intelligible regional differences from others were aggressively implemented by the nationalist governments of the new countries . 
  which is why there seems to be a huge amount of `` distinct languages '' in the region ( eg serbian and its varieties croatian and its varieties bosnian and its varieties montenegrin serbo-croatian etc ) when in reality everyone understands everyone another interesting tidbit i heard once ( whose veracity i can not ascertain ) is that the kkk used to stand in the back of german churches in the usa to make sure the service was in english/didn ' t spread anti-american messages . 
  who is us in this scenario ? 
  europeans ? 
  portuguese ? 
  white people ? 
   even before ( and it 'd have to be true , right ? ), 
  july 4 , 1776 , there was a distinctly ` american ' flavor of the anglo-saxon identity that existed among the otherwise ` british ' people who colonized the area and took swathes of it away from competing dutch and french claims on the aboriginal people 's territories . 
  true , [ albion 's seed ] ( http://www.amazon.ca/albions-seed-british-folkways-america/dp/0195069056 ) is a particularly interesting book on the english roots of some aspects of american culture  some flavoring from the 18th , 19th , and 21st century additions of europe and latin america . 
  as well as africa , an oft ignored source of many modern american traditions  how valid do you think a `` macedonian '' identity is ? 
  a popular conspiracy theory ( may even be true in some part , not sure ) is that tito created it http://www.cc.ece.ntua.gr/~conster/english/pagedata/mac_tito.htm, 
  where can i buy this, 
  intuitively i think a eu that is n't contiguous is pointless seems like biting off more than it could chew i mean what 's the end goal then ? 
  absorbing the entirety of the earth into the eu ? 
  could you offer a brief summary of his main points ? 
  do you see eu at that point being a sovereign country , like the usa ? 
  or an even looser union than it is today, 
  hmm ok i get what you mean , but as i say i do n't think russian imperialism is significantly more evil than us imperialism a us drone in yemen does as much damage as a russian mortar in ukraine ( maybe not as much but you get the point ), 
   preferably splitting it up between serbia and albania can of worms, 
  at that point the european in european union starts losing all meaning, 
  that 's because we 're already a shoo-in mate ;o), 
  if we 're going to fantasize if russia was ever reduced to a rump state with c. 1584/pre-eastward expansion borders i would n't count the idea of them joining the eu this is assuming some kind of massive military expansion from east asia and a world war level crisis , who knows if eu would even exist after that, 
  lmao common balkan joke that felt all too real recently, 
  i 'd say looking at international power struggles through the lens of `` rights '' is fallacious from the get-go it 'd be nice if both russia and america stopped competing but i do n't see it happening any time soon , as both are trying to ensure their respective elites ' interests ( expansion , economic or militaristic ), 
  looks like there is only one solution megali w h e n, 
  i thought sarko was hungarian jewish in origin no ? 
  the way i see it , russians have a `` we are a superpower '' mentality and national identity ( like americans ) , and are trying to keep/consolidate their power in the face of their dwindling influence in eastern europe/caucasus/asia . 
  `` multipolarity '' and `` countering american hegemony '' are key phrases of any pro-russian 's vocabulary , which are n't ignoble goals in and of themselves , but deceptive because under the guise of anti-imperialism is hidden simply another imperialism , less liberal and just as capitalistic/expansionist/militaristic . 
  i interact often with staunch putinists and other proponents of 21st century russian imperialism and it is very hard to persuade them to abandon their position because on the surface , russian power is effectively countering american power , but what good is countering americans if what you 're replacing their influence with is even worse ? 
  i just would n't call russians themselves evil , or even close to the evil of isis . 
   because russia is shopping for military bases in cuba , nicaragua , and venezuela , by your logic the us is completely within its rights to invade any of those countries . 
  ... is this satire ? 
  because this is literally the story of 20th century central and south america, 
  your point thus boils down to `` going against a society 's hivemind wo n't give you good results '' , which i entirely agree with why you decided to then say `` easier to see when you replace the word `` russia '' with `` isis '' '' is what i found comically anti-russian, 
  fuuuucking hell can this sub get any more comical in its hatred of russia it 's good to criticize but cool it with the hyperbole, 
  i almost bite the bait , every time, 
  i do n't know , i do n't buy the idea that catholic church patronage was somehow more biased or less honorable than other art patronage , from rich merchants in florence or german princes or whatever . 
  some could even say it was a better form of patronage , because the church wanted art that represented the glory of god or other `` eternal themes '' , and not ego inflating portraits kings and merchants would order ( among other pieces ) . 
  though i agree with you about the progress in the arts that came with the dutch golden age ( due to rising wealth among the `` middle class '' ) , i still think that considering the economic limitations artists had in the church 's heyday , the church did a great job of financing some world-class artists and thereby creating the phenomenal heritage that is european religious art . 
  yeah , i just watched a short video of it and saw a few pictures , made me real uncomfortable and i 've only heard stories from friends and family about what happened . 
  makes me wonder how wwii vets feel towards wwii games , or iraq/afgahnistan/vietnam war vets towards games that represent those wars in often hyper-realistic ways, 
  my favorite turner [ painting ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/turner_-_rain,_steam_and_speed_-_national_gallery_file.jpg ), 
  i really do n't understand why that makes you discount italian artists how does church patronage discredit anyone 's work ? 
  holy fucking shit what is this game pretty sure this game would trigger ptsd in everyone that 's lived through sarajevo in the 90s, 
  you could also ask r/serbia btw, 
  thing is someone who is n't ready to work that hard in university probably already is n't working that hard in high school, 
  how many people still go through with the decision to pursue medical studies even when the informatif test tells them their chances of graduating as very low , is there any data available on that ? 
  because i assume letting everyone join results in massive drop out rates in the first years of studies, 
  i mean , it 's understandable , they were treated pretty shittily by the russian empire/ussr but holy shit sometimes it seems a little excessive ( e.g. 
  this dude 's comment implying that serbia would , what , be a double agent and help russia invade lithuania from within the eu ? 
  lmao ),

  albanians shouldnt accuse others of rampant nationalism after macedonia earlier this year and now this . 
  k the first source is in albanian , i dont even bother reading serbian sources . 
  second is rt. . . yeah and third is wikileaks , good source , but all it talks about is road blocks on their part of the border . 
  not grenade attacks on the albanian side . 
  nice try . 
  oh gim me sources on those attacks ? 
  lmao okay there neville chamberlain, 
  hopefully marine le pen will kick some arseeee,

  how ? 
  youre saying exactly what im saying . 
  the state has failed to bring in any real changes from 2008 and is incapable of improving the lives of anyone despite independence . 
  a jump from 6k to 22k is telling that kosovo is in a failed state as bad as syria or afghanistan except its not in state of war and neither is albania . 
  so much for newborn . 
  not in the numbers they are now  http://frontex.europa.eu/assets/publications/risk_analysis/annual_risk_analysis_2015.pdf#page=59 almost as much as afghanistan,

  do n't get trolled, 
  you do know all the migrants that are coming from the middle east the third and forth largest group of migrants are from kosovo and albania is respectivly . 
  something great indeed ... 
  it 's a 3 part documentary i think it 's in the second or maybe third check it out, 
  literally isis tiered, 
  uh ohhh whatd we do now, 
  the one country in the world who id support an illegal invasion of, 
  croatian castle walls defend dubrovnik and sword attacks on people in sweden . 
  forget the 90s we are going back to the 1540s, 
  oh well shit happens, 
  well we did land on the beach but lord tywinn and his army came just in time as the city 's defenders were about to lose, 
  well they did attack them too and there was a war between bosnian muslims.and croatianss . 
  they even blew up a thousand year old bridge in mortar because of reasons ... 
  watch the doc the albanian guy even admits he threw a grenade at a serbian refugee centre and went and got a burger as police arrived and adam jashari , suspected of leading and carrying out attacks , was confronted by police , the surrounded his house and told him for 3 hours over speakerphone to come out and surrender but he surrounded himself with women and children and when they decided to go in he shot back using women and children as a shield in order to become the klas martyr .

  lol jk who can afford those, 
  downtown london prices, 
  lol yeah saw that but on the other hand it just proves her point on islam yano, 
  google it, 
  when ? 
  they sent troops into bosnia into kosovo refused to accept kosovo and all that stuff in wwi . 
  that 's a lot more then we 've ever done for russia, 
  he was ethnically croatian . 
  when deciding how to politically divide up yugoslavia tito said `` you ca n't carve up my croatia '' . 
  he was croatian, 
  a really good friend more like best friend even, 
  thats why we consider them great allies, 
  oh strike me down great allah, 
  haram, 
  hated is a strong strong word to use in this case . 
  disagreed is much more acceptable, 
  or just let it go the way of yugoslavia, 
  stalin murdered many russians i doubt he cares for the opinions of russians , he was a complete dictator and no . 
  russia and serbia were just the biggest, 
  tito was a croatian and stalin a georgian . 
  russia is a friend not our mother . 
  that 's just so cringny like wtf . 
  yeah those people are retarded ultranationalists that want to unite with russia .

serbia leads fight against isis and destroys riyadh . 
  us state department agrees it was for the best . 
  m.a in what ? 
  kosovo-albanians caused that damage , eu and serbia made an agreement and signed off on it as did the kosovo government . 
  the kosovo opposition is the one rallying the kosovo-albanians and gassing parliament .

  your reasoning is retarded, 
  as corrupt as vujanovic is nikolic is a national fucking embarrassment that 's for sure, 
  haha, 
  black mountain, 
  so we should just sit back and let isis expand its borders and genocide anyone that does n't agree with their brand of fucked up islam ? 
  i do agree that this is mostly the fault of a previous us president but to say `` should have left isis alone '' is not an option in terms of what they 're doing . 
   many of them are algerian . 
  they did n't really want france , france did n't really want them then wtf are they doing in france ? 
  stop victim blaming . 
  i bet your tune would be different if one of your family members was one of the 130 dead frenchmen !, 
  what happens when you never call them out on their bullshit ? 
  well youre from the uk im sure youve heard of the rotherham case and how the authorities were afraid of being labelled `` racists '' . 
  what ? 
  read the bios some of them had come from the middle east . 
  also if some of them had been in europe for over 20 years thats even worse , just shows that those that are born in europe cant or arent willing to integrate which just makes any kind of immigration pointless . 
  then that would be a strong case for closing all borders into europe . 
  i 'd stop the flow of millions coming in yeah !,

  good guy belgium, 
  our relations with romania are so good that i sometimes forget we border them !, 
  that is one sign of a good neighbor, 
  why all the belgian hate, 
  he signed a non-disclosure agreement not to disclose anything he hears regarding his job at the government and it could be considered treason if he did . 
  so in a sense he did betray his country . 
  but isnt it also wrong to stay quiet when you know what your country is doing is wrong ? 
  bit of a mindfuck , not sure myself ? 
  i like to picture jesus as a ninja fighting off evil samurai, 
  am i the only one who didnt believe in santa as a kid ? 
  my kids better not believe in him either . 
  `` there is no santa kids , i worked my ass off to buy you those gifts , appreciate it ! '',

  not the rich states like ksa , qatar , kuwait and the uae thats for sure , theyve only offered to build mosques those evil disgusting fucks, 
  there was no genocide in kosovo unless you 're talking about the expulsion of the native christian population and the desixration of centuries old christian monastaries . 
  we 're they now ? 
  whwrre do you get this info from ? 
  yeah citizens are a lot different from crazy nationalistic diaspora, 
  they destroyed the evidence, 
  that was in the past and serbia itself was never indicted on genocide but has made amends like donating $ 5 million to srebrenica and handing all those responsible over to the hague .

how is 50k small ? 
  anfield is 45 500 ~ stanford bridge is 41 000 , so is new juventus stadium just some examples, 
  he doesnt, 
  good thing you posted context below , from this post it sounds like you were randomly attacked , when in fact it was hooliganism before/after football ( which is obviously not good either ), 
   yes , it was planned on false grounds , srebrinca . 
  that never happened nor was it the primary motivation for the bombing campaign . 
   that was n't the reason for 1999 bombings at all, 
  you do n't even belong to / r/europe :d, 
  i meant in a way that they do n't yell genocide !, 
  every time someone from germany says something, 
  its ok my friend, 
  nato good serbia bad, 
  what does that have to do with 1999 ? 
  maybe we 're just tired of being the designated villain ? 
  people forgot about nazi germany and now they 're head of eu , when can we expect the same ? 
  how can a german speak about any form of butthurt in war is way beyond me, 
  it 's srebrenica , and i know you people love to yell it every time serbians demand some sympathy but this had nothing to do with it, 
  i wonder how you got 18 upvotes , anyone with at least a bit of knowledge of the subject would know that your sensationalism bullshit is that . . bullshit also your views are so black and white , i honestly hope you 're not older than 18 . 
  i 'm not talking about domestic wars , i 'm speaking globally , like iraq , afghanistan , lybia etc. . also what does romania has to do with it , he 's from belgium ? 
  err how old are you ? 
  plenty of wars in my life time , and i 'm only 21, 
  why do they have magazines out of the rifles ? 
  haha what makes you think i have n't experienced different cultures ? 
  my family is really diverse ( in religious and cultural way ) and i like to think that i know what i 'm talking about , but okay, 
  i 'd argue that a muslim family in albania is not the same culture as my family in belgrade, 
  maybe the bulgarians could do with some history lessons then, 
  there are really different cultures between those countries you went to , and you ca n't just put them all in the same `` the balkans '' post like you did, 
  red croats what, 
  where the hell have you been ? 
   only we , the subscribers of r/europe , should decide what content is worth of frontpage with upvote and downvote button . 
  what , no , what do you think mods are there for ? 
  now you can act smug again right, 
  lol, 
  i 'm sorry i stopped reading after your smug replies to op and constant use of `` slippery slope fallacy '' which you probably picked up here on reddit , because i see it all the time in use by people who want to sound smarter than they are ( and you certainly sound like you try hard ), 
  i 'm sorry but by your logic we should all ban junk/fast food because it too harms our body , and can lead to obesity , and other related stuff . .  what happens to you ripples out an affects your family , your friends , your community , your country , and the ** world ** . 
  cmon . . 
  is there a joke here somewhere, 
   by really tall mountains did you ? 
  that it 's actually in europe , at least part of it , unlike israel, 
  but it 's in every possible european competition/sport etc, 
  dont , he will steal your red audi, 
   this whole subreddit is an eu-circlejerk . 
  look at where you are, 
  yes, 
  thanks for translating that , i had no idea it was denmark !, 
  in serbia we spell it chechenia , with an extra `` e '' , just a not so funny fact, 
  no one is saying anything about ex-ussr republics , like turkmenistan or moldova , but i really think they should know better than to mix sweden with switzerland or czech republic with chechnya, 
  where does it say that ? 
  you win this time, 
  yes also its spring now so fuck your winter, 
  the text is horrible , my neck is sore, 
  i mainly go for the comments to rage or laugh at , but i why do n't you believe ? 
  they 're not really a tabloid paper or anything , and i never had problems with them, 
  us serbs call it pashteta , \u043f\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0435\u0442a, 
  haha, 
  but it is . . 
  dude , cmon , two different languages really ? 
  major differences ? 
  anyone from serbia can understand croatian , and vice versa . . you might want to take a look here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbo-croatian_language, 
   major differences like what, 
  i did nothing to the jews, 
  reasons ? 
  i hate when people do shit like this , `` oh just dont go there , and i wo n't say why '', 
  so many x 's, 
  i do n't know if i 'm imagining , but theres many romanian footballers in italy , this is a long shot but could language be a reason ? 
  ye when we think accents we 're most likely thinking about russian english or french english one , never occurred to me that there 's spanish in french accent etc, 
  you ca n't outrefuge the master refugees, 
  * shudder *, 
  please , we 're not northern ireland, 
  i do n't remember us killing 6 million jews , but you might aswell add that to `` list of shit serbia did '' at this point, 
  lol this is gold, 
  same, 
  sound like america is bad amirite ? 
  * death to america *, 
  ... because it 's the same religion lol , i do n't see your point , they 've been saying that for centuries now , surely you noticed, 
   if you ca n't understand why a person who celebrates war criminals should n't moderate a place like / r/europe [ 1 ] i really ca n't help you . 
  i do n't see where you got that from . 
  i agree he do n't need to be a mod but you should n't be insulted over every comment here , especially the one you picked given it 's not even remotely offensive as you made it be, 
  fair enough , i just do n't like when people are proud of their ignorance on stuff like geography and history, 
   on the world you 're in europe , you 're at least expected to have a basic grasp on where every country in europe is . . 
  it 's considered common knowledge at least here . 
  we were required to know in school anyway, 
  you 're looking for something to be insulted with too hard there m8 also playing into the victim card too much . . 
  i 'm sure you 're not the only one who experienced war and we ca n't all watch what we 're talking about just so you do n't feel insulted, 
  what, 
  i did n't know someone could like a flag so much, 
  hope you 're joking lol, 
  dude you 've come to / r/europe to preach how france was shit and usa and allies had to save them . 
  you think people are not aware or what ? 
  you 're basically talking to yourself , no one is denying you . 
  i just do n't see the point in bringing it up . 
  how did he predict it again ? 
  by saying it 's a hell hole ? 
  `` haha the absolute madman actually did it , stupid americans laughting stock of the world haha '' * posted on twitter from my bomb shelter *, 
  it does n't offend me , i 'm not even french , it was a joke regardless anyway you 're the typical american guy going `` hurr america saved you bro '' and i fucking could n't care less what 's your opinion on france in ww2 and the stereotype ( which only americans are prone too , btw ) that they 're cowards, 
  get the fuck out, 
  sure, 
  come with me to this dark alleyway for a second, 
  it actually was `` flair checks out '' but he edited it lol, 
  what a stupid bullshit argument .

  punching a pot with scoop is famous motive from protests in 1996-1997 ( in case u wondered why would anybody carry a pot and a scoop on protests ) . 
  first one has motive in that eldery mostly use state tv to get informed , so that 's why '' u ca n't see me '' . 
  '' pensioners are with you '' is about that a lot of eldery voted for vu\u010di\u0107 . 
  naah, 
  russia needs friendly turkey so that black sea fleet can exit through bosphorous , am i right ? 
  expelling turkey would only turn turkey completely towards russia , i believe . 
  also , with growing authoritarism , erdogan would be keen on making troubles abroad , presumebly in bosnia and russia looks like to gave up on balkans . 
  balkan countries should be aware of erdogan actions . 
  well , he had quite a persuasive tool in his hands . 
  brace ourselves , ottomans are coming yet again !, 
  execute order 66, 
  plus tax , so a couple thousand more . . 
  okay i will consider it . 
  days of fascination with bregovi\u0107 are long gone . 
  wait , i buy a property , pay a tax and instantly get passport ? 
  no permits ? 
  it is n't fair that two people which can only watch erdogan rants on tv have more power than a turk who knows about reddit . 
  would n't that get you a residence permit which you have to renew every 6 or 7 years until being able to obtain citizenship ? 
  if you think under new things such as buba coreli , jala brat , jack and johnny and similar , nah those things are just awful . 
  i ca n't sing that :d, 
  dunno , never listened to dubioza . 
  syndicate produced music which influenced a lot of childhoods and formed a lot of ways of thinking . 
  syndicate is awesome . 
  i grew up alongside those lyrics . 
  we have to agree that speaking about quality in terms of turbo-folk is quite debatable . 
  ceca is long on the scene but that talks only about public which listens to it . 
  personally , those things such as kiti\u0107 , ceca , keba and similar i can listen only when i am drunk . 
  ceca has gone into being commercial in the last few years but i have somewhat developed sence to music already . 
  kakav argument , zadivljen sam . 
  bulgarians have a thing after a lot of awful , low quality turbo folk musicians from serbia , dunno why . 
  [ relation with ceca ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwd6vnaagyi ) is truly deep and unexplainable . 
  i was once going back from thessaloniki and in somewhere close to sophia [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmlxgckws4y ) was going on a radio . 
  bulgarians have a thing after mile kiti\u0107 , anyway it 's about how fat girls can be hot too . 
  guys , stay safe there . 
  i feel solidarity with everybody who lives under oppresive one-man egomaniac rule . 
  except if you are from vara\u017edin, 
  you live in balkans ? 
  * scratch *, 
  i honestly expected a bulgarian to post [ something else ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuz9obiufrs ) from balkan music . 
  do you mean vo\u0107na salata ? 
  why cyprus is n't considered part of europe ? 
  it is inhabited by people who are by culture and religion identical to rest of europe , at least the eu part . 
  i mean , if azerbejan and kazahstan can be considered europe why cyprus ca n't ? 
   i was born in ussr, 
  ca n't really tell from your irish flair, 
  do u even know what does it mean ? 
  ca n't tell , as a paintings admirer i really have a lot of famous paintings on my mind . 
  look at us - pro-eu protesters are against pro-eu dictator . 
  lol , maybe only first one . 
  second is quite european styled , third resembles each and every royal coronation in the europe at the time . 
  fourth has nothing to do with serbia or balkans . 
  fencing lesson is from montenegro , they are n't albanians , man in the middle wears a black hat with a red top , which is a classic montenegrin hat at the time . 
  such a shame that gnjilane group got so low sentences . 
  in my opinion , they should have been hanged or executed . 
   serbia : the wounded montenegrin ; honestly , this is n't quite known artwork . 
  you really need to be into art to know about it . 
  there is much more famous things , even from paja jovanovi\u0107 , such as [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/sr/e/e5/paja_jovanovic%3bcas_macevanje.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://www.politika.rs/old/uploads/rubrike/305182/i/1/seoba-srba-pancevo.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://riznicasrpska.net/fotografije/umetnicke_slike/pavel_paja_jovanovic_-_krunisanje_cara_dusana,_1900._ulje_na_platnu,_390_x_590_cm.jpg ) .

  also a fun read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nanking_massacre, 
   majority of serbs live  no incidents with ethnic background c'mon , use your head , admit it is the same because of same reason other way around . 
  in the end , it 's up to character . 
  you drop bombs in sea or finish in prison like that greek pilot , or you wait for passanger train to pass across targeted bridge . 
  i do n't consider tito our leader . 
  he would never have been in any sort of charge in serbia , he just happened to be a leader of something which included serbia at the point ( return to king alexander disastorous desicion to create that in the first place ) . 
  milo\u0161evi\u0107 was selfserving but totally out of context for foreign affairs , i mean , belorussia and iraq , lol . 
  romania , greece , cyprus , slovakia and spain, 
  kosovo albanians would very much like to be a part of eu serbia , in order to get eu passports . 
  we had , with 1 or 2 exceptions , really dumb leaders through history . 
  that 's our fault . 
  no long term , strategic plans and thinking . 
  we should really learn from bulgaria . 
  they knew precisely when to shift sides . 
  from what used to be biggest russian satelit in the balkans , they changed sides in 1914 to germans , 1919 to allies , 1941 to hitler , 1944 to russians and 1989 to west , avoiding massive casualties like we had in the both world wars and now they are in eu and we are considered trojan horse . 
  in an alternate universe where nato did n't intervene , that unborn baby would be turning 18 soon . 
  of course not , puppet western governments rule in every single ex yu country, 
  make serbia great again !, 
  no more '' republika srpska '' flair ? 
  pistol and hunting rifle , on several occations . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.novosti.rs/upload/images/2015//05/15n/draza%20 ( 2 ) . jpg ) , but it 's debatable at best . 
  i amazed that you pay so much for bus and cellphone yet so little for food , i believe that 250 pounds cover all of your food expences ? 
  will this obsession with trump eventually end ? 
  towns up to 50k inhabitants mostly do not have public transport . 
  towns up to 100k usually have some sort of , having 1-2 departures per hour during working days . 
  larger towns and belgrade have well developed public and commuter transports , with belgrade 's operating trams and trolleys beside buses . 
  in university towns students can receive large discounts , while most of costs of operating usually goes onto back of employeed people , as they pay highest monthly tickets . 
  on intertown level , coaches are mostly operated by private companies and thus prices are often subject to change . 
  occationaly , for children commuting to school from villages to towns local authorities may subside company . 
  also , lines which are non profitable and in rural areas without major center nearby are operated by state - owned transportation company . 
  still , there are villages where buses still go once a week or do n't go at all . 
  railways are notorious for their delays , yet commuting between belgrade and towns situated in north of the country is relatively okay . 
  trains are much cheaper than coaches on many routes . 
  fun fact is that traveling shorter and to closer destinations is actually easier and less stressful with train , unlike in europe where trains are used for longer routes . 
  lmao, 
  these questions are n't silly , westerners simply can not comperhend that goods and cost of living are so cheap on balkans . 
  american asked me do we use table cloth to clean area around mouth after meal and do we use cutlery when we eat . 
  ( it was during dinner ) i stood up and left . 
  if we stick to folk tale history . 
  thing is that historically , serbia was very much independent from ottoman rule after 1402 and much before 1878 , it 's okay to say that with agreements in 1830 serbia got ridded of turks , 1878 was only formal declaration . 
  serbians were clearly majority , if you do n't believe try to find some turkish censuses online about it - i know that i have seen in multiple serbian books that area was predominantly serbian . 
  hungarians moved en mass out during turkish invasions , serbs did not in so large numbers as they had nowhere to flee .

so basically you 're a traitorous separatist scum that wants to destroy serbia is that it ? 
  crap , i was hoping to have a internet debate with someone i 'm getting hooked on them lately :d, 
  i have to meddle , feel free to ignore me but i have to . 
  first of all , i agree with everything you 've said here except supporting autonomy . 
  the belgrade being overbearing is bad , but that 's not that uncommon for european countries ( look at paris , rome , london etc. ), 
  and the solution is decentralisation , not autonomy , especially not with the serbian balkanization-prone mentality . 
  the big reason serbia 's economy is bad is the huge public sector as a relic of communist time , giving more autonomy and complicating administration is far from being a solution . 
  even now , you have loads of money being spent on city , special region and national politicians with many institutions being doubled ( national and regional protecter of citizens ) , just so that a region with little over 1 million people ( out of 7 million ) would have an autonomy even though it 's not doing much better than the rest of the country without autonomy . 
  besides that , some nations ( serbs , chinese , japanese , french ) just do n't take federalization well and are most united when under one political power , as much as i 'm for financial decentralization i 'm afraid that autonomy of regions in a country that already has sort of lost it 's sense of identity thanks to radical changes ( kingdom of serbia , kingdom of serbs , croats and slovenes , first yugoslavia , second yugoslavia , serbia and montenegro etc. ), 
  in the past will just divide the people even further and destibilize it . 
  actually , considering that the ultra-nationalistic flag being carried was the source of the commotion and hatred i think he did a good thing by taking it down . 
  the fact that the albanian players took that as a provocation as if there was a valid reason for a fascist flag to be carried by a military drone around is far more troubling . 
  also , `` knowing '' that something will not happen and not wanting it to happen are two very different things . 
  just because you 're not able to do bad things or go with your fascist ideas does n't mean you 're good by default . 
  also , if we 're going to start taking football hooligans seriously for their chants and behaviors on stadiums then we should start with the burning of serbia 's flag by albanian fans , or the same violent chants by albanian fans in kosovo . 
  are you serious ? 
  a serbian player in serbia 's capital takes the dangerous nationalistic flag that proclaims annexing land from all countries that border albania ( including serbia ) with albanian-serbian conflict still being a thing and ** his ** actions are seen as a `` provocation '' ? 
  not the fucking drone in serbia with the ultra nationalistic flag that resembled ww2 nazi ideas that had thousands of serbs killed ? 
  taking down the problematic flag is a provocation but not the fascist flag itself ? 
  what are you even implying , that your country would tolerate a fucking drone with a flag of a country with parts of surrounding countries ( including yours ) being annexed to it without trying to take it down ? 
  i have no words , if an albanian player stabbed a serbian player people like you would probable blame the serbian player for ruining his career by dying . 
  the fact that albanian government never had that much power over serbia does n't really mean it 's innocent , every time albania was backed up by some other , stronger force it did repress , expel or kill serbs ( just look at sandzak region ) . 
  albanians did n't live in kosovo before the ottoman invasion , they very much colonised it during that time and participated in ethnic cleansing of serbs in kosovo and rascia region in an attempt of creating `` greater albania '' when albania was a nazi protectorate and anexed kosovo . 
  also , the fact that serbs started coming back to kosovo from which they were expelled during the ottoman era after it became a part of serbia again is hardly a `` colonization '' , if serbs at the time expelled non-serbs i 'd agree that it was something bad , but this way , the anger of albanians because serbs started coming back and the expulsion and cleansing by albanians of serbs in the area in ww2 is not a proof that albanians were victims for being `` colonized '' with migrations of people within their country . 
  i do n't really see the point of this argument , if there is still inequality and tension it 's hardly serbia 's fault , ethnic albanians in serbia have all possible rights while ethnic serbs in albania have albanian names that were forcefully changed by the albanian government and they ca n't easily change it back ( i think it costs 1000 euros or something ) , all albanians from kosovo came back when the war was over in 1999 while serbs that were expelled at the time ( or later ) still have n't and those living in it need police protection to go to church , serbian monasteries in kosovo and historical monuments are being desecrated while albanian muslims in southern serbia can pray freely and without fear and so on . 
  i agree completely , it 's just that when a serb says something about serbian victims people always assume that we 're defending what our side has done or trying to excuse it , i 'm honestly not doing that but i strongly believe that a crime is a crime regardless who has done it . 
  albanians have no right to attack serb civilians today who had nothing to do with the war as a retribution for kosovo war in the same way the serbs did n't have the right to attack civilians in it as a retribution for some terrorist acts done by kla ( or , alternatively , by albanian nazi collaborators during the ww2 ) . 
  it 's just the never ending cycle of hatred that has to be stopped , and the only way to do that is to call out * both * sides on it and specifically punish monsters regardless of ethnicities . 
  neither does serbia , you 'll find that serbia has absolutely no plans for getting back kosovo , at this point it 's trying to protect serbs in it by not giving the albanians all power at once . 
  i know people like to pretend that the kosovo war was one sided but there is a reason that the albanians are the only one 's who 's population is increasing in it while all others are getting the hell out of there . 
  if serbia gave all of it 's remaining power on it to albanian government in it it would mean they 'd essentially be powerless to stop the segregation of serbs that is already happening ( not to mention other , overlooked rapings , killings , theft etc. 
  update : the guy is in stable condition and awake , the police arrested one out of three criminals involved in the beating and is expected to arrest others soon . 
  [ the german ambassador talking about the victims current condition ] ( http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2014&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=13&amp;nav_category=16&amp;nav_id=899380 ) and the [ the serbian police deputy talking about the arrest ] ( http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2014&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=13&amp;nav_category=16&amp;nav_id=899414 ) both articles are in serbian but hopefully google translate will be enough to make it possible to read them , if someone finds articles in english they can link them here as a response or something, 
  i 'd like to see what your living standard would be if you suffered 7 major wars , two ( de facto ) genocides , 3 famines , countless pogroms , two large scale revolutions and few natural disasters in the past century or so . 
  i 'm not saying nordic countries are not better when it comes to all of those parameters or that serbs should n't try harder but , come on . 
  considering the long standing anti-fascist politics of the country , never having colonies , never enslaving anyone , never having discriminating laws against people based on their ethnicity/race , being among the first feminist countries in the ( `` unevolved '' ) balkans , i 'd say it 's not fair or true to portray the country of 7,2 million people as being `` barbaric '' because one stranger got beaten up by hooligans in the capital 's downtown . 
  i suppose ( from what i read here ) that you 're more worried about the homophobic part and i ( as a bisexual guy ) agree , but according to ilga europe serbia is one of the countries that made the fastest progresses when it came to lgbt rights in the past year ( as fast as the uk ) and things really are getting better , fast . 
  you can see by the serbian comments here what to people in serbia think of this , so claiming that all serbs are like that because of few criminals would be like claiming that all british people are serial killers because of the jack the ripper . 
  i 'm beyond revolted that this happened but seriously , cut the crap , how many are their violent beatings in other european cities in a week or a month ? 
  if this guy dies he would be the second stranger killed by hooligans ( bruce taton would be the first ) in a period of 5 + years in a city that is visited by 600 000 plus foreign visitors per year , that 's 1:1 500 000 chance that you 'll be beaten up as a foreigner in serbia ( you have greater chance to be hit by an asteroid ) . can you honestly say that english cities ( for example ) have less than two xenophobic/homophobic beatings/killing in a period of five years ? 
  the whole country is horrified by this and the first thing this morning there was a lgbt walk in the main street of the city demanding justice and that the criminals be persecuted as soon as possible http://i0.wp.com/inserbia.info/today/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/labris-belgrade-protest.jpg?resize=700%2c462 with the the police deputy promising to make it a priority . 
  do n't try to portray balkans as `` unevolved '' when the `` evolution '' of the rest of europe meant colonizing , invading and enslaving nations that were also `` barbaric and unevolved '' at the time for not having the same power to portray their societies as perfect in the western world and being victims of propaganda that is biased in a way of showing only individuals who behave that way to convince the public that they 're all like that and need to be `` civilized '' by said europeans through exploitation . 
  to be quite honest , i did n't have the patience to read all this , i just skimmed it and from what i 've read it 's 90 % bullshit . 
  go see `` demographics of serbia '' and you 'll find that 90 % of croats did n't leave serbia during the nineties , if anything , the rate of croatian emigration from serbia ( mainly caused by bad economy ) was slower in the nineties than the decades before . 
  really , nothing you can come up with justifies the fact that 60 % percent of total serbian civilian population have been eradicated from croatia in a single `` justified '' military operation , no matter how badly you want to pretend it was n't a forced migration . 
  you said it yourself , the serbian military forces left croatia before the croatian forces came , i have no idea how can you pretend that operation storm was a defense tactic when it was directed towards civilians but whatever . 
  operation storm was the second time during the 20th century when civilians where killed/expelled from croatia just for being ethnically serbian , no matter how you try to portray it or whatever logical twists you come up with to justify it serbs are going to keep remembering it and find it a crime against humanity . 
  the logical fallacy of false equality wo n't work , saying that `` we all did bad stuff before '' wo n't excuse the removal of serbs from the territories that are now croatia out of fascism and extreme nationalism , period . 
  you really do n't know that 's basically impossible for a person from serbia to get croatian citizenship ( unless it 's by marriage or something like that ) ? 
  it was clear as daylight that he was a ultra nationalist . 
  he was at rallies with seselj during the 90s . 
  he followed his agenda . 
  serbs that voted for him did n't do it by accident . 
  the too are nationalists who share the same mentality . 
  not really , he completely refuted that mentality , if people wanted to vote for nationalistic ideas they would vote for the nationalistic party he was a part of , not the pro-european , anti-nationalistic party he created . 
  i 'm not saying that he was never nationalistic or that he completely changed but his politics did and that 's what people voted for . 
   if croatia has a problem , implying all croats some how form one being , than serbia is beyond saving . 
  really , croatia messes with serbian politics ? 
  your anti-croat bigotry is eating up your rationality . 
  you sound like a paranoid schizo . 
  a seselj fan i imagine . 
  okay , croatia does n't meddle in serbia 's politics all the time , just the people who are democratically elected to do so by a majority of the croatian population . 
   difference is croatian forces did n't banish 200,000 serbs . 
  stop rewriting history . 
  you are rehashing operation storm into something it is not because it is all you can come up with to wipe away the shame of what serbs did in croatia and bosnia . 
  now , those 170,000 were by serb forces . 
  the did not leave on their own is the point . 
  you never mention the actual ethnic cleansing of croats , yet claim serbs leaving krajina as ethnic cleansing even though they were not forced to leave by the croats . 
  out of over 120 orthodox churches in the region only one was destroyed in combat . 
  one would think more would be done if the intent was the force out serbs . 
  that is the point . 
  but whatever . 
  you will just deny it anyway . 
  serbian forces ethnically cleansed 170 000 serb civilians from croatia ? 
  serbian forces who retreated from croatia before the croatian soldiers came and politely not-forced 170 000 civilians to leave their homes ? 
  are you honestly so deep in denying ethnic cleansing of ~ 70 % of total serbian population in croatia that you 're going to pretend that they left the homes they lived in for centuries all by themselves and went to serbia by foot to live in the streets because they were left with nothing ? 
  amazing . 
  i absolutely agree , all croatian refugees from serbia should return and all serbian refugees from croatia should return . 
  the serbs in croatia made up about 12 percent of the population , now there are about 4 percent of serbs in croatia , i believe that croatian government would have nothing against serbs returning and making up more than 1/10 of all population in croatia , right ? 
   also , 200000 were n't ethnicly cleansed . 
  most left before croatian forces even got there . 
  perhaps croats are annoyed that serbs have no sympathy for the 170,000 croats ethnically cleansed from `` serbian '' krajina , there own home ? 
  or perhaps constantly labeling us all as fascists ? 
  or perhaps the serbian presidnet , who you guy elected , said things like ( ... ) ethnically , president - see , i can be obnoxious and point out typos in other people 's posts too and your whole `` logic '' is really ridiculous , `` serbs banishing 170 000 croats from krajina is a crime '' while `` croats banishing 200 000 serbs from krajina '' is a legitimate military operation ( that was carried on unarmed civilians , children and old people ) to be celebrated . 
  and those who left were soldiers who came to fight , those who stayed were civilians that had nothing to do with the war and yet were forced out of their homes and homeland . 
  as for nikolic , he is one of the most hated presidents we ever had and became a president only after publicly denouncing his former ideals and proclaiming to be pro-european etc. 
  the difference between a person who was elected years after denouncing nationalistic ideals and politicians who use their power for nationalistic temper tantrums * should * be obvious to anyone with a half of brain . 
  that 's called operation storm and the whole operation was criticized and called the `` most successful ethnic cleansing of the yugoslav wars '' ? 
  i honestly do n't get what are you even trying to say, 
  you are thinking of savamala , the part they are building on is mostly railway tracks and dump . 
  savamala is * supposed * to remain the same . 
  and , new belgrade is pretty much upgrading by itself , there are almost always modern buildings being built there and the property value is rising . 
  also , as much as i do n't like the socialist-era architecture i think that it 's kinda interesting to keep it as a monument to the communist historical era and unusual examples of yugoslav brutalism . 
  sorry for replying to you 2 days after you made your comment , i did n't see it earlier . 
  also , there is a blatant lack of transparency about the contract and the fact that the deadline for building this is 30 years from now . 
  whole new belgrade was built faster and that happened 40 years ago . 
  uck was is a terrorist organization , and was classified by such even by cia until u.s began supporting it . 
  it operated in macedonia , southern serbia and montenegro ( even though macedonia , for example , had nothing to do with the kosovo war ) . 
  the sheer numbers of crimes against humanity that it 's leaders made and are in a process of being prosecuted for by international court are undeniable and no amount of playing the victim card can erase the ultra-nationalistic , criminal operations and ideologies that uck supported . 
  there were protests against prosecuting those who killed 5 macedonian civilians and then those erupted into a nationalistic craze .

  that he was ousted by an angry mob of west ukrainans does n't mean the whole country suddenly turned pro-eu . 
  in fact , the demonstrations in the crimea ( prior to the invasion ) and donetsk clearly show they do n't . 
  the eu could n't even handle tiny switzerland , why would anyone think they could deal with a major power ? 
   the ** western ** ukrainian people , without crimea , prefer fixed that for you, 
  that 's racist !, 
  and they got a nobel prize for being such a good boy ... maybe if russia does n't fight a war in the end , they should get one too ? 
  i remember in 1999 just before the kosovo war started , there were talks of ww3 breaking out , the russians broke off some important talks etc. 
  and the un security council clearly did not allow nato to bomb serbia . 
  back then , there was a lot of concern of a `` catastrophe '' happening ... nato did n't give shit and went ahead with its illegal war . 
  under nato i mean germany also participated , which is now so concerned about what is happening in ukraine . 
  i bet poland is shitting its pants because they think the possibility of russia attacking nato is huuuge . 
  what nato is doing is classical sable rattling , it has nothing to do with fears . 
  when the us just invaded another country several times in the past decade , was that a `` catastrophe '' ? 
  this subreddit is really getting on my nerves ... why are you people downvoting someone who is pointing you the obvious hypocrisy in merkel 's statement ? 
  why is it ok for [ poland and the us to hold war games ] ( http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-us-polish-war-games-start-bad-weather-delays-naval-drills/1868889.html ) but when russia does it , it 's a `` catastrophe '' ? 
  the dax , ftse and euro stoxx 50 indexes also fell 5-10 % in the past week so this is more than just related to russia . 
  that 's hilarious, 
  cool , but as i understand they are only talk about building a pipeline ? 
  so that would take another decade until it 's realized . 
  ukraine is as big as france and has a pop . 
  of like 40 million , hungary is a tiny pop . 
  9 million country . 
  i do n't think they 're afraid , they 're probably just vandals who live out their frustrations , and since the russians would actually fight back , they only have ... 
  i do n't think they can ban people , only officials . 
  so if they come as ordinary eu citizens they have the right for free movement . 
  what 's that $ 1 bag there ? 
  american help ? 
  clearly the whole building needs to be demolished but i never was arguing that it should n't . 
  my point was we need to look at how the building got into the state it is now , and maybe learn something from it . 
  just blaming it on `` the authorities '' means actually that no one is responsible . 
   and have them reimburse me for the purchase . 
  that 's weird ... 
  i agree about fixing the pipes and the roof , that is the landlord 's responsibility . 
  but the stuff that ** you ** break should be paid/fixed by ** you ** . 
  in that sense , if you live in a white room for a year and the walls become yellow , then you need to pay for them to get painted . 
  if you 're showering and the water is leaking on the apartment below you , then you fix their ceiling ( or pay for it ) , not the administration . 
  if you break the pipes intentionally then you should pay for it . 
  if they break themselves then it 's not your responsibility . 
  mould happens . 
  i had it in my current apartment where i live as a subtenant . 
  guess what i did : a ) waited for the landlord to clean the walls b ) paid 3 euros for the fucking spray and cleaned it myself it 's not rocket science . 
  it takes just 30 minutes . 
  i have no idea how some of the serious damage happened , and i wo n't make theories because that would lead to another discussion ... let 's just say that someone who studies 12-14 hours a day , like what people on this thread are claiming , wo n't rip out a pipe from the wall . 
   and that totally exempts the people that own this building and who are responsible for them of everything ? 
  i have lived as a subtenant in many people 's apartments . 
  if the toilet is dirty i clean it . 
  if i break something , i fix it . 
  if the walls are dirty when i leave , i 'll pay for them to get painted . 
  of course major works like fixing the pipes or the roof , that are n't caused by me , are paid by the landlord . 
  you know what would happen if i just said `` fuck it it 's not my responsibility '' ? 
  well i do n't know , maybe the landlord would kick my ass . 
  do you think what i 'm saying here is wrong ? 
  i agree , yes , there should be some basic service here , perhaps a cleaning lady to mop up the floors every weekend . 
  we do n't know , maybe there * is * a cleaning lady . 
  but a building can not get ruined this much without the active participation of the tenants . 
  if the general attitude is that `` someone else will fix it '' and `` i 'm not going to pay for it if it will help someone else too '' , then you get the result on these pictures . 
   55 euros per month where do i sign up ? 
  you forgot about the 65 euros you get back as food . 
  you 're effectively paying -10 euros . 
  paying ? 
  they 're paying 55 euros/month and receive 65 euros of food stamps in return . 
  it seems to me they 're paying -10 euros . 
  well then they obviously failed at that because the dorm rooms look miserable . 
  maybe they just were n't responsible . 
  as people . 
  let me ask you a question : you are studying in your room and it 's night , the light bulb burns out . 
  what do you do ? 
  wait for the `` administration '' to fix it or buy the damn lamp yourself ? 
  now extrapolate the situation to washing floors and fixing pipes . 
  in the rest of your life you will have situations when you are * working * 15-16 hours for months , every day , on weekends too , and you 'll be living in your own apartment . 
  who will fix your apartment for you ? 
  this building is beyond repair , i 'm not denying that . 
  i 'm trying to point to the cause of its current state . 
  back when the * first * pipe broke , they * should have * spent their daddy 's allowance on fixing it . 
  then it would 've cost a lot less . 
  now it 's too late . 
   buildings like this explain to me how is a building like this different from an ordinary high rise building , where people live ? 
  if your kitchen is rotting are you going to complain about the `` institutions '' or will you fix it ? 
  if the pipes are broken then do you fix it , or you leave it broken ? 
  i mean it 's obvious that in this situation it was like `` oh the pipe is broken ? 
  fuck it i 'll be out of this room in 4 months anyway . 
  i 'm not going to spend 10 euros of * my own money * to fix it ! '', 
   that is why that norwegian prisons look how they do or maybe because the prisoners clean up after themselves . 
   these students are lazy if the skin color of these students was just a little bit darker then we 'd have people on this forum saying how the state of the building is typical because they are genetically lazy , and others would say that it 's because they are victims of opression . 
  since i 'm guessing most of these students are not roma , they do n't have that `` excuse '' : they are just lazy as shit . 
  sorry i had a fucked up day, 
  clearly the building did n't turn into what it is over night . 
  it 's decades of `` i do n't give a fuck '' and `` it 's not my job '' attitude that happened here . 
  i 'm not saying it 's fixable now , only that there 's a reason why a norwegian prison looks better than this dorm , and it 's not aliens or jews . 
  and perhaps you 're a proponent of the `` no one can pay me so little as little i can work '' work ethic ? 
  the `` acting '' president , you mean the guy that came to power through the coup ? 
  he has as much legitimacy as moamer ghaddafi . 
  how is a student prevented from spending 1 hour a day from cleaning up the place he lives in ? 
  it 's what he/she will have to do anyway for the rest of the life , unless they can afford to pay a housekeeper . 
  it 's not a shame to do house work . 
  you know what these health , able-bodied young boys and girls could do ? 
  get off their asses and clean up the place where they live !, 
  it 's not that hard , get one of those 0.2 eur sponges , an 1 eur detergent , kneel down and clean . 
  wikipedia says tartar is used for the sauce :  nowadays tatar is usually used to refer to the people , but tartar is still almost always used for derived terms such as tartar sauce or steak tartare, 
   there was a un sanctioned nato-led multinational force that was legal in all respects of international law except the un resolution was brought after serbia was bombed into submission , and it was signed ( and approved by russia ) only because it guaranteed that kosovo will remain part of serbia .

  are you saying that the 80 % of non-syrians go somewhere else ? 
  maybe globalization is not such a great thing then especially when it 's so often accompanied labor exploitation , wage slavery , ttip/tpp style free trade agreements , disaster capitalism ... fuck all that bullshit , we can live without cheap iphones if it means less suffering and more stability, 
   or should i say `` asylkritiker '' ? 
  gasp not the critics !, 
  i 'm starting to think that it is impossible to sustain a strong welfare state if your population does n't sustain a good birthrate forever ( pretty hard to do when your country is wealthy , mostly irreligious , and women are mostly liberated , all great things by themselves ) . 
  there 's a reason the country with the most success in accepting extremely high numbers of immigrants has a barely existing welfare state ... 
  the worst part of your comment is that this is one of the most probable outcomes of the primaries what a time to be alive ... 
  people are saying it should be beefed up, 
  wew that 's a pretty ugly flag , looks like the logo of an it company also that meme is pretty dank good job, 
  this is pretty irrelevant but what is your flair supposed to be ? 
  i remember you had italy before now it 's a little green triangle on a white background , secretly britbong ? 
  yeah germany has been brigaded too , the whole country has had a suspicious decline in approval of the great humanitarian merkel 's stance on the whole debacle . 
  i 'm pretty sure those pesky racist sites are emigrating to germany and fucking up their public opinion polls . 
  idk if they are drugged but it 's not rare for beggars to use babies as props to incite sympathy . 
  it 's a pretty well known anecdote that in india that beggars sometimes use dead/drugged babies ( ! ), 
  as a tool for more money , one that they then exchange between each other in their begging rings . 
  http://www.travelindiasmart.com/beggars.php here 's a `` source '' on a baby throwing scam in europe : http://www.travelandleisure.com/slideshows/worlds-worst-travel-scams/11 i do n't think you can get any better source than this unfortunately , take that as you will, 
  that 's pretty cool , had n't thought abt the sun setting in the west . 
  pad means fall , so that makes complete sense . 
  wonder why west and fall do n't have the same etymological origin, 
  zapad literally means `` west '' in serbian and croatian ... very spooky, 
  idk , i wish the numbers were more precise, 
  why austria-hungary ? 
  you enjoy being told what to do by some noble fuck in vienna who considers you a dumb slav ? 
  i can understand disliking yugoslavia but it just sounds like wanting to trade masters, 
  if you look at the graph serbia proper just stagnated during that period , while others lost, 
  obviously but it makes me do triple takes when i see it, 
  interesting , good to know, 
  source ? 
  do n't see anything on wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_intervention_against_isil, 
  people using cyrillic letters as a substitue for latin ones is always so bizarre to me `` biggeya gayaden should be iice '' is what you wrote lol, 
  point taken, 
  ca n't really blame him , there is no denying that the media is always banking on a `` huge crisis '' that they ignore once the new one comes up i do n't think the migrant crisis is like that though , it 's been months and i still read about it every single day from various sources , even ones i do not visit myself but am just incidentally exposed to ( so less confirmation bias ) . 
  i think this is `` two pages in a history textbook '' important at least . 
  well is relative , and while you guys are successful in many things , not every country wants to become america, 
  the way that whole `` workforce '' need was met in the past was by actually making children . 
  yes , i know it 's hard , yes , i know they 've tried `` everything '' ( if some alright tax cuts and parental leave counts as everything ... ) , but importing a foreign workforce every generation is a recipe for disaster , a nightmare for assimilation , and an overall completely unsustainable policy . 
  you did n't meet any qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ? 
  hard to believe unless you only stayed somewhere in plateau and did n't go out at all, 
  yeah lmao i think it 's pretty obvious that merkel will give a huge `` we must protect our borders '' speech if the trend keeps up for a few more weeks, 
  who makes the tests though ? 
  i 'd argue not as much in a socialist country, 
  fascinating stuff , i 'll have to look more into  but we do know who what village had more x victims than y victims of our mutual wrongdoings . 
  this is the worst yugoslav meme : /, 
  muh gdp per capita is the best measure of quality of life, 
  except yugoslavia was not a `` balkan shithole '', 
  how come i never heard about this ? 
  this is crazy !, 
  imagine yugoslavia being south korea level successful to this day wow, 
  i do n't think it 's fair to choose refugees that way , the way the uk is going about it seems like a near optimal solution to me, 
  obviously . 
  i lean towards the `` very little numbers of highly educated individuals and stringent assimilation practices '' side rather than the open borders one though . 
  well i do n't study at sciencespo but i did go to a presentation they did at my school for their international student programs . 
  the way it works if i recall correctly is that you get assigned to one of those regional campuses ( depending on where you 're from , for example someone from americas would go to the reims campus i think ) for a few years then you can do the rest of your degree or a masters program in paris . 
  you should ask them in an email though, 
  it 's pretty well-renowned in the politics/journalism world , good luck in your application !, 
  oh man you just gave me a great idea for this christmas break ... never been to slovenija in winter though only summer, 
   humanitarian superpower that 's really an important swedish political concept ? 
  i agree , but is that a justification to let every pakistani that desires it move to the uk ? 
  the great majority of the world 's population lives in poor and shit countries , we run the risk of fucking up the rich countries faster without even making a significant dent in world poverty . 
  how can we , in the same breath , say loud and clear that multiculturalism is great & will work on an even larger scale than today and at the same time say that the west fucked up a lot of the middle-east and africa by drawing arbitrary borders that did not take into account the particular religions/tribes/ethnic groups and thus created regions doomed to sectarian violence and separatism ? 
   the unitarian and orthodox churches love each other ... they do n't fight each other in the street for starters ... 
  portugal good country . 
  sympathetic country . 
  very great visit portugal . 
  check per capita and % of gdp : /, 
   what 's the benefit of that classification just like it beneficial to observe the effects of any ideology on a group of humans , it is beneficial to observe the effects of islam on immigrants and refugees in europe . 
   i have personally received around one islamist death threat per month over the past 15 years . 
  i am proud for every one of them . 
  how ? 
  what do you that provokes them like that ? 
   im just saying that the idea of an extreme right with socialist streaks isnt particularly new alright yeah that 's true , i just dislike when people say that right-wing + socialism = nazi genocide !!!, 
  nazis were only socialist in name btw , they murdered actual socialist nazis . 
  idk exactly what their proposals are but you 're saying they 're literally hitler basically when they 're not . 
  they did n't consider themselves french , but rather as fighters for islam first . 
  if that is n't proof that assimilation of descendants of immigrants is not foolproof idk what is, 
  the charlie hebdo shooters were `` born and bred '' french . 
  calling us stupid religious racist slavs is always acceptable man do n't you watch the news, 
  i think i 've heard fn talk about the idiocy ghettos and criticize the french govt/eu many times . 
  the left criticizes exterior agents when it comes to economics as well . 
   they wo n't tell detention center then, 
  and this will serve what purpose ? 
  maybe help people know if they should let their neighbor feed their pets while they 're on vacation ? 
  also someone is shadowbanned, 
   `` the conversation with president putin was largely friendly and familial because we find common ground very easily , and mostly russia would never ask for anything from serbia , it is always serbia that asks for something from russia , and luckily , russia is a real backbone and real support to serbia . '', 
  wonder how long this will last , what with serbia getting closer and closer to the eu and co. 
  yep , that 's pretty much exactly what i 'm talking about . 
  rich kids , kids of businessmen and politicians , really show how terrible some people 's ideas can be even when they are rich and educated . 
  their arguments `` against free speech '' are so pathetically foreign and incompatible with france 's values that i 'm saddened more people are n't criticizing them openly . 
  * what is worse * fucking ridiculous smh . 
  the worst one i saw recently was a fake charlie hebdo comic of the little syrian kid who drowned in greece being shared on facebook , and * every * single one of those guys was commenting `` ils veulent se faire deglinguer une deuxieme fois ou quoi ? 
  '' , * completely * missing the point . 
  out of curiosity , hec ? 
  thank you for adding the very valuable literally hitler \u2122 card to my deck of euroskeptic arguments lmao, 
  listen i really wish i could do this but you sound like a broken record , maybe you do n't understanding english that well or something but you are constantly misinterpreting the most basic thing i am saying . 
  `` provide arguments with le science '' what arguments you have n't advanced any position and just continue calling me uneducated for some reason , you 're just a guy who thinks in 2nd grade-terms with bad guys and good guys in politics . 
  probably a troll like the other guy said . 
   this is how these things are defined muh circular definitons right = evil , left = good , so naturally evil = right and good = left  ) ) learn to facts and rational  fedora tip this is how you sound  they did the exact opposite they destroyed old orders and had different visions in how to implement equality but that 's what they did . 
  literally the definiton of left wing politics for anyone who knows anything . 
  policies ?

  so you could have 2 brothers one of which speaks serbian while the other speaks montenegrin . 
  so in short , croatian , serbian and bosnian have iso codes , montenegrin does n't . 
  despite the code , most linguists consider all of them to be 1 language anyway - serbo-croatian . 
  it 's all a language continuum , so the closer you are , the more likely you speak more similar , despite your language . 
  month, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njtmtsxts_i the best one , imo, 
  i 've looked through that channel and i only know of 2-3 songs lol, 
   ( which led to this modern parody ) i actually have this in my playlist lol, 
  and [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate#/media/file:road_traffic_accidents_world_map_-_death_-_who2012.svg ) is portugal having more deaths per 100 000 than serbia in 2012 . 
  i 'd go even as far to say you 're safer driving in extremely flat northern serbia during the summer than you are in portugal . 
  our numbers are similar , despite our death rate being skewed by icy and snowy roads for around 2 months , which you do n't have , combined with being more mountainous than you which means having more turns , blind spots etc. 
  he 's very anti-eu . 
  considering vat is widely ignored in greece , it wo n't help much with the budget :p, 
  not much of an opinion , but here 's what i learnt in school about it : - north was industrious - south was agricultural which meant their economy was based a lot on slavery - south slave numbers were higher in relative to population , so their economy would tank if it were abolished - lincoln popped up in the north and abolished slavery - south was not happy - south was led by general lee - north was led by general grant , which later became a president and is now chilling on the front end of the $ 50 note - south starts winning the war - north turns the tides , due to being more industrious - north wins, 
  as someone said 32-33 and over . 
  35-40 temperatures are frequent and 40 + occur almost every summer couple of days, 
  best feeling : when you 're drunk on a wedding already deep into the celebration and [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/kxivfqlda-s?t=44 ) starts . 
  i get annoyed a bit , and that 's it . 
  but the special place in hell should be reserved to those making oc maps from wikipedia which contains data for pretty much every country in the world . 
  so they only put countries of the eu and name the title `` number of x per capita in europe '' . 
  thankfully they 're few , but they do exist  . , 
  americans for some reason tend to think serbian girls are easy and end up having less game than they would 've in the usa . 
  it is n't because he 's from slovakia . 
  2500euro in slovakia is much more than 2500 euro in scotland . 
   as someone who considers himself to be an upper class man from bratislava  i make around 2500 net / month and i still ca n't afford a 50k + car that 's your answer . 
  you are n't upper class . 
  i know a couple of real upper class , and the figures they make monthly are likely a couple dozen of thousands euro . 
  you 'd be surprised how rich some people are and you do n't know about it . 
  even if you take people making 10k into consideration , it may seem ` only ' x4 more than you , but the difference is far bigger than with with someone making x4 less than you . 
  those 7500e over the course of the year = new car . 
  so to answer , those people buy expensive cars . 
  most of them are business owners , but also people with money are big into renting business ( mostly luxurious apartments and business buildings ) , profiting from interest rate of the money they keep in several banks , holding shares , buying land and selling it once it reaches higher market price ( this can be insanely good profit , but can be risky and prolonged sometimes ) . 
  well you must live higher up north , because in balkans , italy , spain , portugal summer heat waves lasts for 2-3 months, 
   edit : and an installation price ranges from 150-200 $ . 
  around 50e here . 
  you realize there are plenty of countries in europe in which ac is used right ?

  i had it as username on a game i was frequently playing . 
  i do n't remember why , i was a kid , but the zeros were supposted to be eyes ... 
  so after forgetting my first reddit username ( yea , my memory is shit ) i used this one as i have it well remembered . 
  besides the obvious ones ; i understand russian and slovak rather well . 
  a bit of german too . 
  they 're more similar . 
  and it also depends on the region you 're from . 
  i understand people from eastern croatia better than people from southern serbia for example . 
   hungarian is a whole different story though , i would n't say i understand anything at all - it 's like comparing english and albanian . 
  ca n't really google it right now , but i think it 's even more distant . 
  my neighbor has 4-5 of those st george 1000 notes . 
  that 's what i was going by . 
  yep . 
  raid is the most popular brand, 
  answers here are surprising i must say . 
  did n't expect so many firemen , nurses policemen . 
  anyway for serbia : programmers any type of medical doctor university professors higher ranking military personnel judges pilots businessmen lawyers, 
  i found austrian history/culture to be much more interesting than prussian/german one .

  [ marija \u017de\u017eelj ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/buznjrpbgy9/?taken-by=marijazezelj ) as of recently first heard of her from this [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scvzjqqvauc ) [ nata\u0161a bekvalac ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qasyvliwt5u ) and the prettiest imo is [ tamara aleksi\u0107 ] ( http://imgur.com/a/o1rm6 ) and [ another one ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7eikajvdgkq/u-yv0hgkz8i/aaaaaaaamjy/xxk03cfc1do/s1600/tamara-aleksic-1407969245-550815.jpg ) tho note that i 'm not very familiar with our celebrity scene , so there might be `` better '' answers . 
  oh i recognize elsa from los serrano lol, 
  it 's alright i guess ? 
  here 's me [ reading your post ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s15fi4uhg6pt ) , so you can be the judge of that . 
  i gave up near the end as your sentence is too damn long !, 
  excuse the shitty microphone . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcldw7k86gg that guy was 3rd place at this year 's presidential elections in serbia, 
  maybe they start eu accession talks after 2050 . 
  just maybe . 
  [ 76 % ] ( http://puu.sh/we6bu/8f6bd71c38.jpg ), 
  it 's actually a gamble with low probability and high reward :p, 
  czech republic , poland , finland, 
  maybe only iceland . 
  nor and sui wo n't , i think . 
  that empire would actually span from pacific to atlantic ocean . 
  holy, 
  that empire would actually span from pacific to atlantic ocean . 
  holy, 
  serbian : vikipedija . 
  it 's also the biggest wiki in balkans ( in terms of article number ) . 
  n 's in nizhny are pronounced as the n with a tilda in `` espana '' . 
  zh is like french j in `` je '' . 
  here http://vocaroo.com/i/s0w2xrdfltuq, 
  serbian word for wien is be\u010d ( bech ) . 
  probably taken from hungarian . 
  word for greece , gr\u010dka ( grchka ) might be considered horroric to some , due to lack of vowels . 
  maybe once per a year or two . 
  when there 's a very strong storm . 
  tuga means sadness in serbian lol, 
  it 's pronounced similar to j in japanese `` gaijin '' or `` nihonjin '' . 
  thats not really relevant . 
  if irish people dont learn their own language , its not disrespectful if you dont either, 
  funny thing - in serbia we do n't really use that , but people in croatia , montenegro and bosnia have a differentiating names for ethnic serbs and people living in serbia - serbians . 
  well , at least we call you ma\u0111arska , which is similar to your own name for the country, 
  we have that phoneme , yet we do n't call you espa\u00f1a . 
   yes . 
  it would be a fault of respect not to . 
  [ considering they do n't put much effort into it ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/percentage_stating_they_speak_irish_daily_outside_the_education_system_in_the_2011_census.png/800px-percentage_stating_they_speak_irish_daily_outside_the_education_system_in_the_2011_census.png ) , would it really be ? 
  we have a similar saying :  da kom\u0161iji umre krava which translates roughly to :  may the neighbor 's cow die used when someone gets pleasure for someone 's misfortune he gains nothing out of . 
  what exactly is the north in croatia ... ?

  as i said , i was curious about the concrete aspects that are destroyed . 
  afaik 16 % of the nl population are immigrants - so you could call that * massive * . 
  what particular aspects of the culture have been destroyed ? 
  as a fairly recent immigrant to the nl myself , i am curious to know what aspects of the dutch culture are destroyed in the last 30-50 years ? 
  to me it looks like dutch culture is still very distinct , alive & kicking . 
  i 'm supposed to fly tomorrow . 
  with your recent successes in fight against corruption and your low unemployment , the difference is getting bigger . 
  you find it hard to believe because it is not true . 
  they were beaten because they were gays . 
  \u017dene u crnom are a target because they remind people of the horrible truth of srebrenica . 
  but slightly over 50 % of the population are pro-eu . 
  they ca n't be all getting beaten . 
  `` they let anyone in these days '' ... 
  jimmies would be rustled . 
  i would buy a passport cover that looks like this . 
  and then i 'd put my serbian passport inside just to confuse people . 
  but seriously , nice work , i like it . 
  i heard this argument many times in serbia , but i disagree . 
  in the west people thought the same of gays as late as 50 years ago . 
  but their method worked out in the end , and i see no reason for it not to work in countries such as serbia or russia . 
  in serbia you can even see . 
  pride 2010 created a warzone out of belgrade , it was that bad that the next 3 attempts were forbidden by the government . 
  but then when pride 2014 finally happened , there were almost no riots at all , although everyone was prepared for them . 
  and i firmly believe that the next pride events will be more calm , until they become something normal , and then simply a party for everyone . 
  please do not feed the troll . 
  basically everything he says is incorrect , and there is good evidence that he 's not from serbia at all . 
  he 's just trolling . 
  please do not feed the troll .

  he 's just trolling . 
  when i opened my account at wells fargo i got a rather big stack of checks to do with them what i please . 
  i had a job in reno , nv , and was getting paid by check . 
  granted , all this was in 2008 . 
  not sure if things have changed since then . 
  btw , i see you live in nyc . 
  you have my envy , it 's the best place i 've ever been to . 
  it is definitely alienating when you 're not in it but surrounded by it . 
  not that short-stay visas are not required any more it 's a bit better , but before it was indeed ridiculous . 
  while waiting for the parent , i 'll have a go , just what i could think of in a couple of minutes : 1 ) almost non-existant public transport 2 ) listed price is not what you pay at the register 3 ) impossibly cheap gas 4 ) free refills for sodas 5 ) cities are not really walkable 6 ) people speaking only a single language 7 ) people not really aware of what 's going on in other countries 8 ) short vacations 9 ) wall-to-wall carpeting everywhere 10 ) a/c everywhere 11 ) checks as a payment method 12 ) different traffic boards, 
  you are both making very reasonable arguements . 
  it is confusing me , i do n't know who to agree with !, 
  no , they are just getting very good at detecting it . 
  blond serbian checking in . 
  we definitely exist , but are a minority . 
  that would probably not work well too , for several reasons : * some modeling gigs ( lingerie , for example ) prefer `` curvier '' body types . 
  it would be easier for models to achieve requested bmi for such gigs , leaving the rest of the industry in trouble . 
  * 18 is high . 
  you 'll get girls exercising compulsively to maintain enough muscle mass to get as close to the runway look while still maintaining the mandatory bmi . 
  * it is enough to find one bribeable doctor and all the agencies that use him/her are in advantage ( btw , more respectable agencies already * do * care about the health of their models ) . 
  * there are costs associated . 
  models ' wages are already not very high , and this would make them lower . 
  i think it is a better solution to simply introduce an age limit , set it somewhere between 16 and 18 . 
  i think this would mostly solve the `` too thin '' problem as well . 
  that is simply not true . 
  i see your point , and the point of the law , but i disagree with it . 
  i would really like to see some numbers that support it . 
  afaik , only a small minority of actual anorectics become so because they saw skinny models on tv . 
  as with most self-destructive behaviours , it is usually a symptom of some other , underlying , problem , until it becomes an addiction . 
  secondly , how do you estimate which model is `` anorexic '' ? 
  it is a psychological illness that requires a professional to diagnose it . 
  would send all the runway girls to mandatory psych sessions ? 
  or weigh them ? 
  i ca n't see this being enforced without models losing some of their dignity ... 
   well you could say that obesity prevents you from doing a lot of job not by law , though . 
  imagine if there were a law preventing fat people from doing their jobs after they go past certain weight . 
  this is no different . 
  i plan to visit both at some point . 
  there is a high-speed train going from one to another , the price is like $ 80 for something like 4-hour trip the last time i checked . 
  so , completely doable . 
  all the horrible politics aside , i think it 'd be well worth the trip . 
  serbia and hungary : step 1 ) lose wars . 
  step 2 ) profit . 
  oh yes . 
  the media are really enjoying this one , in the meantime conveniently forgetting that the serbian state is doing everything in its power to keep quality of life in kosovo as low as possible . 
  can we rent her ? 
  i think so , yes . 
  if iron curtain = = communism , then it was , but civil liberties and freedoms were much better . 
  yugoslavs had freedom of travel to the west - thus , the curtain was n't really that iron for them . 
  things like this propagate , to the east in balkan case . 
  thus , neighbours , hurry up , and then we 'll be next . 
  student agency coaches have free wi-fi inside and are quite comfortable , more so than planes i 'd say . 
  for people worried that this will increase organised crime : it wo n't . 
  tourist visas are generally not a problem for criminal organisation - those organisations that want to operate in the eu , already do . 
  the worse case scenario is that this might increase petty crime , say pickpockets who visit one of the major cities for a 3 months long `` working holiday '' . 
  on the other hand , this will enormously help regular people of kosovo to feel part of the continent they live in . 
  not being able to travel freely , not even to neighbouring countries , is an incredibly isolating experience . 
  this decision makes me glad . 
   cache cash . 
  well they are n't that secret anymore , are they ? 
  sometimes eurostat includes ( some of the ) candidate countries in these things . 
  keep in mind that 's a single guy 's opinion . 
  in my opinion , it were not the cultural differences that brought yugoslavia down , but the fact that ruling elites in 80s and early 90s in both serbia and croatia ( way more in serbia ) found it easy to use ethnicity and religion as means to prolong and expand their power , not hesitating to ignite a war when it suited them . 
  i do n't think the cultural differences are all that big . 
  i feel they are bigger within italy , but italy had luck not to be under communism . 
  ok , that honestly sounds nothing like djb . 
  these are the `` good '' guys : http://dostajebilo.rs/ ( serbian only ) . 
  the vast majority of / r/serbia voted for them . 
  it 's not going to happen for as long as they are in this shape . 
  even if ( somehow ) all the other countries would agree , france has to hold a referendum for their entry . 
  as it is , that referendum will never pass .

  oh there is some of that still , everywhere , houses of people that did n't want to or could n't return after the war . 
  usually isolated villages that had a `` minority '' ethnicity , or those of people that had to get away in the exoduses . 
  and someone who has the ability to do what this guy did , will do it regardless of his origin and nationality . 
  the balkans as a whole is n't the war wasteland people imagine . 
  man we beat ourselves up way too much . 
  thank you for telling me . 
  now i 'm curious , what did he say if its fine to ask ? 
  come on man how is he responsible for anything ? 
  / u/zurfer75 out of all people too ... 
  so what should he do ? 
  go to prison ? 
  mildly interesting , there was a black general in russia 's army in the 18th century * . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abram_petrovich_gannibal edit : and he is pushkin 's great-grandfather . 
  what do you know about me to say that ? 
  not in a million years ( nato i mean ) . 
  generally no one cares when it is about slavs/eastern europeans . 
  let alone russians/serbs . 
  our gdp is some 45ish billions , one more or less , i would n't mind . 
  and it goes to ( among other things ) `` developing democracy '' , or better said `` getting a new car for the president and his lackeys '' . 
  i get your point tho , we do n't get to play around with money and refuse it . 
  for a country . 
  well fine , that is also an opinion . 
  generally you are right , but i 'd just like to add one thing , serbs are actually weak-willed bosnians who betrayed islam for christianity and then split from the other croat christians and imagined their own identity . 
  i for one admit that i am a bosnian as i have a dozen ancient kurans in the basement of my great grandma 's stone house that prove my ancestors ' faith . 
  ehh look my point is just that there is no such thing as * clean * and * just * war . 
  calm down wub_wub , you know how it is here . 
  \\* gives a shot of sljivovica *, 
  i think war is simply war , i do n't believe in any rightfulness about it . 
  but thats just like my opinion . 
  i am thinking maybe that is among the minorities . 
  we already know how to live on bare bread crumbs , a meatless bone like those 1,5 billion wo n't change much . 
   just wars that is a very simplistic and intellectually dishonest way of looking at war . 
  well not like we need them anyways . 
  who 's gon na attack us that we would need nato to protect ? 
  going against the whole west alone proved to be a bit too brash of us before , now we should just stay low and neutral , and not ~ ~ give ~ ~ send * our men to die in nato 's wars . 
  ohh right , do n't know what to tell you , maybe its picking the lesser of the evils kind of situation so they still support the gov. 
  i am joking , oh you superior being who ca n't comprehend sarcasm and lame polandball jokes . 
  the government = / = the president perhaps ? 
  yeah , we need more homogay and western decadence !, 
  nato ca n't kill you if you kill yourself first !, 
  wait you mean there are 12 % who voted * for * nato membership ? 
  kek, 
  aaand they 've fucked up our flag ... whats up with hungarians ? 
  first they want to build a wall between us and now this . 
  and european basketball championship for women . 
  t'was a good evening for us . 
  the ones in the balkans are pretty brown , and definitely darker than a spanish person . 
   rowing , equestrian sports , cycling , fencing how yuropean . 
  yep same here , i was n't even aware it was going on . 
  wait does studying/working in america immediately mean you are american ? 
  and you can always say `` stotinu '' if you want to avoid confusion , but those kindergarden `` sto '' jokes never get old !, 
   \u0437\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e thank you , i will try to import this fine word to serbian , our loanword collection is still hungry . 
  of course , its your * linguistic freedom * !, 
  i think `` taman '' is a turkish loanword ( if some tur\u010din would be so nice to confirm and spare me the googlework * ? ) . 
  you just mistranslated knap , it also means when something fits just barely , so it can be connected with the actual german meaning ( barely/scarcely any space left ) like those guys said . 
  i say it will be 10 days before they want out . 
  i bet he is all like : `` oh stop it you ! '', 
  * blushes *, 
  gee this is surprising !, 
   ~ ~ sky ~ ~ heavenly people please ... 
  yeah , i 'm a big fan btw . 
  they must have learned that trick from us !, 
  dunno how spread out the whole aleksandar the great thing actually is tho . 
  hmm did n't know anything about that . 
  ca n't understand the documentary tho :\\ i have some relatives in macedonia , from the north . 
  they ( the great-grandparents ) used to declare themselves as serbs , then as yugoslavs , today the younger ones are macedonian and full of pride for aleksandar greatski , its a whole mess . 
  oh snap so we fucked that one up too , did n't we ? 
  lol, 
  i 've always wondered do you still have a grudge on us over macedonia and the second balkan war ? 
  there are people that would do that ? 
  damn . 
  what tourists ? 
  yeah it is montenegrin tradition , those tourists were obviously being culturally insensitive . 
  well yeah if russians were as uh , war frenzied , as the balkans was back then , it maybe would escalate . 
   it took them some time to decide what they want and by the time they decided we managed to get some weapons ... mostly from barracks we took . 
  haha exactly . 
  what a shitty decision to have to make . 
  a cherry grenade on top here and there , to mix things up a bit !, 
  yes jna officers were lacking definitely , it was like a half-assed war in some ways . 
  yeah that was my point , because you know , * there still are n't any russian soldiers there * !, 
  only vacation !, 
  if russia was to go full on with ukraine like serbia ( or yugoslavia ) was with you , it would be much worse i reckon . 
  oh its complicated even for us who live here . 
  so should now the russian population be expelled ? 
  i do n't understand this `` rightfully ours '' narrative , its always either ethnicity or `` historical belonging '' its never one thing constantly , its used the way it suits the speaker . 
  but comrade , when i was on vacation , half the signs were in russian !, 
  and the ladies renting apartments were all olyas and natalyas . 
  this is clear and not at all silly proof of my claim !, 
  jk aside , it is a popular vacation destination for russians , right ? 
  i think russians maybe prefer montenegro , as they own half of it . 
  did you go between the walls inside and try and climb that shaky metal ladder to the top ? 
  :d man i have such memories at that place . 
  well perhaps , we ca n't get into their minds , but since sculptures that had nothing to do with stuff like that were also destroyed ( like those busts ) , i think there was some other reason as well . 
  do n't get me wrong i 'm not all `` boo hoo look at what they did '' , or making some conspiracy conclusions , i just translated what i read . 
  nor am i judging croatians , some really intense ` rvatine probably did it , ca n't be hypocritical and say we do n't have those too . 
  well thats great actually because those concrete buildings have a positive effect on your studying and concentration as they wo n't distract you with pretty colors and windows . 
  so look on the bright side !, 
  ` tis a fact proven by scientists of course . 
  i 'm just saying what i read in that article that his works were targeted specifically , as there are other monuments that were n't attacked . 
  also some of those had nothing to do with either partisans , socialism , or * anything * political .

what that hitler nonsense ? 
  not even gon na dognify that with an answer, 
  always remain a dream ? 
  im supposed to take him on his dreams lol ? 
  he even said it was a fucking dream . 
  now youre just fishing fucko, 
  kosovo and albania are literally afghanistan tiered in terms of economic migrants . 
  is the ec fucking high ??? 
   http://frontex.europa.eu/assets/publications/risk_analysis/annual_risk_analysis_2015.pdf#page=59, 
  okay go live in your deluded world of self grandeur, 
  wikipedia where you can write in your own history, 
  dont forget that kosovo and albania make up the largest european countries in terms of economic refugees , they even surpassed somalia !, 
  except theres no war there ...  http://frontex.europa.eu/assets/publications/risk_analysis/annual_risk_analysis_2015.pdf#page=59, 
  georgia , ukraine - yes kosovo - the 4th largest economic refugees come from kosovo , its basically a syria and afghanistan type of situation but theres no war !!!, 
  turkey - a country that has been turning more islamic and totalitarian by the day , a government that has attacked and taken over the head of the opposition party newspaper and tear gassed demonstrators and is using the migrants as a way to get what they want ? 
  there are no legally binding principles in international affairs, 
  you wait, 
  cept you know if you forget josip simunovic 's stunt and the swastika in the grass and the hugeee popularity of thompson band which brandishes symbols of the fascist ustase regime, 
  whataboutism over here ... 
  according toooooo yourselves ? 
  p.s balkans are in europe . 
  stop winking at me, 
  were they ? 
  because they all claim that they did through their langauge but who can claim what ancient illyrian sounded like ? 
  all they claim is that its a `` deep feeling we all have '' which is next to bullshit . 
  no but its a part of european identity culturally , with christmas and santa and easter etc. . 
  oh really ? 
  you know what ancient illyrian sounded like do ya ? 
  im a simple man, 
  and an invasion of polan ... err i mean isis, 
   you 'd have to have a strong populist personality like orban first . 
  there 's no one like that in croatia , by a a long shot . 
  i dnno man id recognize kosovo for a night with kolinda, 
  corrupt country in a corrupt organization , makes sense ye, 
  but there is no evidence at all of them being oldest people in europe like at all . 
  you all call yourselves illyrians and dardarian a and oldest people of europe but there is no proof of this at all like zeroooo, 
  am talking about kosovo, 
  native europeans while the oldest churches in kosovo are serbian . 
  lol, 
  native europeans arent muslim . 
  go back to turkistan, 
   kosovo : is serbian you all just made a new bff, 
  a 2 year old article by an albanian author ? 
  members of the eu do n't even recognize kosovo and no one has vetoed serbia in terms of kosovo, 
  what about it ? 
  no theyre not , serbia is committed to fulfilling the community guidelines and has something like 3 chapters opened but croatias reasons for blocking the process are complete nonsense . 
  serbia has barely 7 million people , polan has almost 40 million . 
  of course theyll have more migrants that choose to move . 
  the only one vetoing us is your shitty government , no one else, 
  that movie sucked , all i got from it was the uk trying to laugh off islmix terror ** `` terrorists are funny , rig ... right guys '' **, 
  do n't think the eu to be so weak, 
  our main destination is germany , sleep easy britbongs, 
  aside from kosovo sounds like murrrrrica, 
  shoot em all nd start from scratch !, 
  cause you did n't exist , stop making up your history on wikipedia, 
  again you 're not giving me any reasons why you find it dumb just expecting me to understand your dumb reasoning . 
  your reasoning is just to scream racism if someone does n't agree with you is it ? 
  elaborate , dont just sit there expecting me to understand your reasoning . 
  if youve got a point to make then say it . 
  who else are they gon na back ? 
  batshit crazy bashar al assad ? 
  or maybe the dictators in hamas or fatah or maybe just maybe isis ? 
  not a lot of good options in the area, 
  oh god shutup please . 
  serbs boycotted the elections thats why it came out to 99 % , dont try to straw-man the information on me . 
   it was n't ethnic cleansing . 
  no one forced them to leave . 
  in bih you had concentration camps , terror tactics , massacres , burning down homes , etc. 
  completely different . 
  uhhh yes they did . 
  in kosovo and croatia serbs were forced to elave under threat of violence . 
  where do you get your facts from ? 
   hardly any atrocities accompanied it . 
  riiighttt just a lot of dead serbs in croatia but if you ignore those no atrocities accomplished it . 
  smart on their end tbh, 
  historically israel has n't given a shit what the rest of the world thinks, 
  accurate, 
  kosovo is serbia ? 
  exactly that 's my point they did i because they were true refugees and not moving for some gain but rather just flee a conflict for the time being, 
  talk to kosovo and croatia about ethnic cleansing since theirs is always forgotten as well as the organ trade in which the evidence was thrown to rubbish . 
  when your voice isnt heard and ignored basically military option is usually a good alternative . 
  there was rape and death camps on all sides, 
  yes but did they move around the middle east looking for the place with the best benefits ? 
  of course , when you try and tear a large minority from their homes of course they will be the ones to voice their dissatisfaction the loudest, 
  vice versa, 
  serbia never attacked bosnia , bosnia declared independence from yugoslavia while the large minority of serbs in bosnia didnt want to be separated from belgrade , aka serbia , so they rebelled with the support of serbia . 
  this is exactly what happened in croatia too . 
  thats not an excuse . 
  agreed , nothing good ever comes out of saudi arabia , nothing . 
  good for you switzerland , do n't take no shit . 
  just build a merkel wall, 
  i do n't care to belong to any club that would have me as a member, 
  vucic and his cronies arent a good thing , theyre pro-eu but theyre corrupt cunts that the eu wont touch . 
  im just trolloing, 
  no serbia so relevant, 
  cant say im surprised, 
  irrelevant countries, 
  thank youuuuuu djokovic, 
  lol dat detail on the serbian election, 
  hey stop that,

  we only need to negotiate about price . 
  [ who says that ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country ), 
  and put an elevator on that wall . 
   they will try to go through croatia and slovenia . 
  and experience double checking . 
  their better option is to go to albania and then to italy from there . 
  they have montenegro , albania and greece to smuggle people into italy . 
  they will go through the italy . 
  did you read the text ? 
  i am speaking about ww2 crimes . 
  oh look , the civilized croats , were croatia and bosnia found guilty for over 100000 killed serbs in the most sadistic kind of ways ? 
  when these countries accept the genocide , we will too . 
   nice topic switching there . 
  it 's not topic switching , the situation in sarajevo is not bearable . 
  try being a serb in sarajevo . 
  oh , let 's see , when we did it , it was ok but now when serbs want to do the same `` genocidal maniacs '' `` assholes '' `` scum '' `` mongols '' `` turks '' `` gypsies '' `` carpathian goatfuckers '' . 
  could slovenia and croatia do that without seceding from yugoslavia ? 
  and how many serbs are there in sarajevo , you can count them on the fingers . 
  remaining serbs in fbih would sell their houses as soon as someone offers them a decent price to get the fuck out of that shithole . 
  that 's what happened last month when isis fighters offered serbs to buy their houses , all of them sold their houses except some guy which came back from germany . 
  how about the parts where they want to turn bosnia into a unitary state . 
  rs is here to stay . 
  why should we show an affection towards people that want to kill all of us ? 
  this month they beat the shit out of some old fart with diabetes in sarajevo just because he had a shirt with double-headed-eagle , are we supposed to live in the same country with that kind of people ? 
   it 's not like they started killing you immediately . 
  serbs accepted all the peace deals given by the international community while the bosniaks rejected all . 
  serbs would have settled in 33 % of territory of bosnia but bosniaks simply wanted whole of bosnia for them . 
  now let them live in the shit they created . 
  even the first victim of the war was the serb on a wedding . 
   at least bosniaks have a noticeable opposition that 's not nationalist and that 's trying to calm the situation down , to let the wounds heal . 
  where is such an opposition in srpska ? 
  thanks but no thanks , just for the bosniaks to respect the dayton and everything will be fine , there will be no secession . 
   i 'll bet you do n't like how croatia expelled its serbs after oluja do you see anyone giving a fuck ? 
  maybe if oric did n't escape from srebrenica mladic would n't have killed all the others . 
  it was interesting for him to provoke and then when the devil himself came , he escaped as fast as he could . 
  and so what , they killed 3000 of ours , we killed 8000 of theirs . 
  it 's just a score . 
  go suck a dick , bosniaks were just bosniaks , they were no yugoslavians but now you expect serbs to declare themselves as bosnians . 
  do bosniaks want to live with the serbs or not because they did n't show any sign that they will welcome serbs into bosnia ? 
  so , you want for them to claim that they are bosniaks themselves ? 
   serbs went in , killed women and children not really , srebrenica is called male genocide for a reason . 
  no women or children were harmed . 
  they were evacuated . 
  he asked for tl ; dr, 
  they will put more tanks on the border of the rf , more rockets in the kaliningrad and etc. 
  learn to read cyrillic , it will take half a month to learn it . 
  it 's fairly easy to understand text .

  [ serbs are evil , what can i say . 
  ] ( http://img.thesun.co.uk/aidemitlum/archive/00241/f_200610_october10s_241692a.jpg ), 
  they are just showing affection towards buddhist religion . 
   you are right . 
  awful people . 
  see them everywhere i go these days . 
  see , that 's what i am telling you guys , whenever i go outside in the belgrade i see montenegrins . 
  even when i enter uprava in some mesna zajednica , it 's full of montenegrins , really awful people . 
  well sre . 
  happened after the genocide convention was made . 
  still it is not even by older laws , all the things up i said are not recognized or partially recognized . 
  for example the ustashe crimes are partially recognized , no country is held responsible for it . 
  neither is armenian genocide , it 's also rejected as a genocide by the uk and the usa . 
  nope , serbia will enter as the first country that committed genocide into the genocide convention . 
  hehe , our politicians already signed a deal where nato can use the territory of serbia and they did n't ask anyone about it . 
  we do n't border albania , we border albanians . 
  austria has the most stationed troops on the kosovo also in the bosnia . 
  and the biggest head ( something like president ) of the bosnia is austrian . 
  serbian flag ... check !, 
  feels fine, 
  nope , i am just advocating the removal of benefits for the montenegrins . 
  they left our union in 2006 yet they still have all the benefits like they are the citizens of serbia . 
  edit : also i am a montenegrin myself as is 50 % of serbia so i do n't really get why would speaking bad about montenegrins be considered racism or something similar . 
  good news , then we should close the borders with macedonia , montenegro and little albania edit : we should also send back albanians that escaped to serbia when that shit in macedonia happened and all the montenegrins from the belgrade . 
  we need more of these songs . 
  [ pa dobro se drzi za uzde ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crnivqqot1c ), 
  they have gas , oil , tourism , also the war ended in 1995 for them , they also have access to the serbian custom union while serbia does n't to croatia 's . 
  on the other hand serbia threw a lot of money onto the kosovo ( about 600 000 00 euros every year and more ) , had to house 500 000 refugees , got out of the sanctions in 2004 , blocked from using nuclear power , nato destroyed every single factory and part of the infrastructure . 
  tito - 35 years on the power milo djukanovic - 25 years on the power , ten years more and he is the new tito . 
  believing what danas says . 
  draza just spews pro-western propaganda ( the worst kind of it ) and half of the times his sources are his ass . 
  russia did n't support actions by serbia back then and supported all sanctions against it . 
  they only got mad later about kosovo ( which is a different thing ) . 
  edit : however there is a possibility for them to expand the list . 
  one may wonder if srebrenica is genocide then why does sumarice , armenian genocide , sisak , jasenovac are not recognized as one . 
  in all cases it will be interesting . 
  serbia got from the un embargo after october of 2001 and out from the sanctions imposed by the west in 2004 . 
  it 's kinda strange seeing that we were even that big . 
  gdp is the better indicator . 
  look at croatia , it would seem that the standard in croatia is better than in hungary while the hungary has bigger gdp but it 's the fake standard , that 's why their debt is going up fast . 
  the difference is that we want bosnia fucked up . 
  they want to live with us then they should accept our flaws . 
  actually the difference was bigger than it is today . 
  they were 3 times richer , now they are only twice . 
  you are seriously comparing b92 with klix.ba , i dare you to go to b92 and find comments about butchering people and how people deserve to be butchered , raped and what not just because they belong to a certain ethnic group . 
  go visit klix.ba the biggest news portal in the bosnia and read the comments about multiculturalism . 
  what 's funny is that all comments are like that , there is such a great creativity there . 
  it 's not like i lied , over 90 % of the serbs want to secede . 
  are more nationalistic . 
  than serbs . 
  actually even the 45 % is far off , our army is the size of the estonian one and if you look at it compared to the population size , we are the smallest army in europe ( and we are not even a nato member ) .

  montenegro is more corrupt than serbia though . 
  and it 's doing only slightly better economically . 
  edit : instead of downvotes on the theme you clearly know nothing about , reply to me and prove me wrong, 
  well yep you bullshitted as i thought . 
  it 's a legacy of metabolism slowing down as you age and therefore making them gain weight easier . 
   but to eastern europeans , $ 4 is expensive so it 's more of a luxury treat . 
  you can eat here for far less than 4 $ though . 
  some centre of belgrade prices : gyros 2.20 - 2.50 $ various boreks 100g 0.50 - 0.80 various dough products 0.20 - 1 sandwiches 1-2 $ crepes 1-2 $ pizzas 0.80-1 .80 $ pljeskavica 1.50 - 2 $ prices ofc vary from place ot place, 
   they even gave belgrad to suleiman the magnificent , because they are more scared hungarians than osman empire source ? 
  we still study latin in most of the highschools . 
  everyone is weirded out by london and dublin which are major tech/financial cities in which millions of people live , but no one is surprised fucking reykjavik , in the middle of artic steppe is 1300 $ ? 
   nato occupies itself for starters , cyprus is n't in nato . 
   how the heck did it got 11 upvotes 10 people knew the previous information, 
   both greece and turkey is nato members  greece  greece you realize northern cypus is ... in cyprus ? 
  which is an independent country ? 
  but the color coding the comment chain is talking about is different . 
  i like how you do n't even understand what the post is about yet you cry about it the most, 
  bulgarian is the mother of all slavic languages ?? 
  bulgarian is the least slavic of all , considering the grammar lol . 
  crna gora is of slavic origin , while montenegro is of romance . 
  do n't most of you learn german ? 
  and inaccurate, 
  reposting my post from a couple of days ago serbia : 37 % german ** 33 % french ** 25 % russian 3 % italian 1 % spanish http://srednjeskole.edukacija.rs/obrazovanje/koji-jezici-se-uce-u-skolama-u-srbiji, 
  dunno how the russian education is , but you can at least be proud of your computer science education . 
  the western countries are knowingly exporting crap to ee . 
  the data comparisions between the countries is useless as some countries do n't have the sub default sub 'd upon making an account . 
  i do n't think there is a country more culturally similar to greece than turkey, 
  just wondering . 
  you 're around 70 years old and using reddit ? 
  sure , sure ... 
  well it 's probably just a dozen of 60 + people declaring their village shall be putinovo . 
  um you realize raki and rakija are different drinks , right ? 
  do n't be an idiot . 
  destruction of this scale was completely unnecessary . 
  french is seen by some people as pretty and posh contrary to russian and german, 
  yes . 
  what about it ? 
  this is the 2nd foreign . 
  english is mandatory for everyone, 
  17 place - high . 
  not bad . 
  it 's only gon na get higher . 
  tho i did n't expect some countries to be better . 
  they * should of * learnt the difference !, 
  http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2016/11/09/russian-economy-inches-forward-says-world-bank tldr :  in 2016 , the economy is projected to contract by 0.6 percent , and grow by 1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.7 percent in 2018  at 5.6 percent , unemployment is at near minimum levels . 
  in september 2016 , inflation was 7.5 percent -- less than half of the 15.9 percent in the same period in 2015 . 
   the report also flags that disposable income continues to decline in real terms , contracting by 5.8 percent in the first eight months of 2016 . 
  despite this contraction , the poverty rate is expected to slightly decline from 13.3 percent in 2015 to 13 percent in 2016, 
  that was n't a product of his management , but rather a product of america coming out of the recession from 2008 . 
  well they dont sell it because its only the young people moving out , the old people ( 60 + ) keep living in villages so the villages will be almost non existant in a few decades . 
  the demand for those houses is virtuall non existant too . 
  americans are notorious for jerking it on the veterans and people who `` served '' . 
  montenegrin villages are really beautiful , but a lot of them are facing depopulation problems ... winters are hard , schools/hospitals/markets are far . 
  they 're splendid during the summer though . 
  that 's some really stupid sentiment . 
  neutrality is when 1 side does n't favor any side between the opposing two . 
  therefore , with some healthy logic you can deduce holding military exercises with both sides is neutral by the definition of neutrality - not favoring any side . 
  you can continue with the sentimental `` it 's us or them '' logic , but that 's not how the geopolitics work . 
  serbia does multiple times more exercises with nato than russia , but i guess those news do n't sell the newspapers over there . 
  before you call bs because i put no source : http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/serbia-s-nato-army-cooperation-beats-russia-significantly-08-30-2016, 
  i do n't think so . 
  my grandma has heart problems for a while and the hospitals really helped her stay alive . 
  the problem is , in my opinion , the fact cardiovascular problems appear in the first place to a lot of people due to bad diet , drinking a lot of coffee/alcohol and living in a stressful environment . 
  to simplify it - per 1000 people , there must be at least x2 more cardiovascular problems in ee than we . 
  well germany seems to have more furries than spain , portugal , france and italy combined . 
   because they do n't like being called gamers . 
  with the money some of these people are making i do n't think they give a shit what you call them , to be honest . 
  if i just made 2 million from clicking with mouse and keyboard for 10 days , for all i care you could 've called me a whore . 
  also a player on the winning team just became the first pro esports player to have passed the $ 3million earnings from tournaments ( 3.3 million ) . 
  making his yearly earnings from tournaments only - ~ 470 000 usd or 39 000 usd/month . 
  i mean it 's all about perception . 
  one ca n't be wrong or right about this . 
  eu institutions , probably, 
  i actually agree . 
  instead of `` it 's not worth fighting over '' some redditors exhibit the `` oh god , please make a shitstorm in the comments '' preference, 
  the deal is , danish christmas you speak of is yule . 
  i know about how the two came to be , but now they are pretty much different holidays . 
   mostly in the form of food ( polenta , gola\u017e ) you 're kinda scoring an auto goal there :p, 
   christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of jesus christ , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] observed most commonly on december 25 [ 4 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world . 
  you do n't really have any leverage , so it 's not a stupid move at all . 
  you on the other hand ... 
  how did serbia occupy croatia exactly ? 
  considering how the conversation is going it seems that you 're the one thats gon na do some crying lol, 
  oh you poor thing !, 
  [ i post this in every thread such as this one ] ( https://imgur.com/a/tndve ), 
  why the fuck is the title sugar coating this ? 
  you do n't fail to notify someone . 
  you just do n't . 
  failing implies an attempt which was n't successful . 
  notifying someone ca n't be failed , it can be done or not done . 
  i volunteer to solve italy 's low number, 
  i do n't think it 's that hard to understand ... ? 
  you use gas for heating , not generating electricity . 
   being this economically illeterate, 
  but did n't we already have military drills with nato ? 
  or were they outside serbia , so this one happens to be the first in serbia ? 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/6jtvp8/serbian_flag_in_the_style_of_the_marshall_islands/ ) one has more upvotes, 
  how can he slap ? 
  can you stop lying on this sub already ? 
  croats may speak the same language as we do but we 're most definitely not the same people .

  turkey really needs the support from the eu . 
  fuck the pkk , terrorist organization , nothing `` moderate '' about car bombers . 
  you mean like what happened in ankara ? 
  it 's only been a week and a half , i 'm sure people were n't highlighting their facebook photos with turkish flags over it . 
  it depends , i live in ohio and i know a couple of them , some are pretty alright , wish that it did n't come to it that way and what not , then some who thought the worst thing to happen was to break away . 
  it 's unfortunate that the dissolution of yugoslavia was n't as simple as the berlin wall falling though . 
  i have 72 dollars in my bank account . 
  i would like to buy one george washington please . 
  no , they want to throw money at israel instead . 
  massive immigration with the freedom to move around the eu minus the uk . 
  whats the worse that can happen ? 
  i guess that explains why nobody eats fish either here in the us . 
  they 've been open for 20 years , i hope i would n't be the first to correct them hehe . 
  yeah i was at a restaurant in cleveland that served shepherd 's pie with beef mince . 
  that was quite unfortunate . 
  i did n't even want to be that jackass to say something there . 
  british sheppard 's pie ca n't be beat anywhere in the world or us i 've found out . 
  most of the time they use beef mince for it instead of lamb mince . 
  does this sound as hilarious as i think it does . 
  a giant ethernet cable across the atlantic and connected into a computer in spain ? 
  so taking a page out of america 's economy back a decade earlier ? 
  yeah that does n't look too good . 
  it 's okay , we 're not the only ones , a lot of them still will never acknowledge the good things america has done for europe . 
  it 's where the pride part comes in . 
  yep , what else is new . 
  it 's an unfortunate truth about europe . 
  the cold war ended not that long ago , wwii a bit longer than that . 
  still many countries holding grudges against each other , disliking each other . 
  it 's always a `` them vs us '' mentality . 
  a lot of countries have to swallow their pride and move forward . 
  yeah well , you actually get arrested or shot by gangs/civilians for doing the shitting things these people are doing . 
  yeah , trying to negotiate with a non-recognized primitive terror state sounds like it would work . 
  maybe while we 're at it we all can apologize for not being born as pure muslims . 
  sounds like political suicide if it goes sour . 
  `` insert money/tax question here '', 
  i mean fuck , the whole disappeared plane from malaysia was a story for 3 or 4 months last year . 
  for all we know , isis could be 6 different villages or whatnot , who actually knows who they are ? 
  that 's good !, 
  i really did n't know , the uk used to be really bad about that sort of stuff , i hope the rest of europe follows through . 
  yeah i assume you 're talking about the spanish fans that threw a banana at a black player . 
  yeah in the us racism puts someone in a situation worse than even sexual offender status . 
  good points though i do agree . 
  yeah i 'm willing to agree with you , but we wo n't really know for sure , because there is n't much tolerance for that kind of behavior in the us . 
  some guy ran into the court at an nba game for some cause and got banned for life . 
  in some european countries , burning flags at the game is like second nature . 
  it 's kind of ridiculous . 
  i wish , maybe another space race will get humans on mars and europa, 
  yeah , i mean , for being considered a diplomatic president he 's not willing to put aside his differences with russia , and assad to help out for the good of many western countries . 
  for the first time we could see eye to eye with a common purpose russia and the usa , and he simply does n't want to do that . 
  well yeah , the nfl/the teams itself is n't afraid to ban anyone who goes out of line . 
  someone boo 'd at a moment of silence for paris at a green bay packers game and the star qb called them out and said that he has disappointed at them . 
  yeah easily . 
  i do n't know what it is . 
  nfl football fans here in the us can be just as bad except they can get banned for acting like idiots . 
  i do n't understand why hooligans are n't permanently banned, 
  living in america , nfl football fans and college fans can rival football fans but they all are among the worst kinds of people i 've wittnessed . 
  you mean the whole `` moderate rebels '' belief ? 
  yeah that is one of the most retarded things i 've ever heard . 
  somehow i keep hearing it here in the us that the moderate rebels want to win the war . 
  literally who is that ? 
  who ? 
  there is n't a fine line between the syrian government , those rebels , and isis . 
  i know here in the us we really hated dictatorships and basically non-democratic nations but there are times where i firmly believe that a lot of these nations in the middle east are better off being ruled by a stable dictator than ruled by an unstable democracy . 
  too proud to be broken by primitive savages . 
  eventually the line will be drawn . 
  europe , where ww 1 and 2 happened , the cold war , the french , austria , and russian empires . 
  europe has spent much of its history in warfare . 
  all this tolerance and multi-culturalism will eventually wear out and they will find themselves in a hole . 
  yeah , i 've went to school with many turks here in us half the time i do n't even realize they are muslims when they 're wearing nike shoes , and osu fan shirts . 
  government forces , rebel factions , isis , usa , russia . 
  would n't surprise me if there are fighters who 've found themselves fighting on every faction . 
  apparently a fucked up joke about welsh people shag sheep . 
  holy shit , you ca n't make this shit up ... 
  hahahahahahha scheisseporno ... god damn it . 
  yeah i really do n't want to see the death penalty go . 
  living here in the states if you do something fucked up like what tsarenev did , or that school shooter in oregon , you do n't have to rights to your own life anymore . 
  i do n't even think it 's possible to find a realistic positive solution . 
  i do n't think anybody wants either of those sides to completely take control and we know what happens if the us tries to force democracy on a middle eastern country ... yeah that did n't go so well . 
  your solution would be better than having assad or terrorists take control of the entire country but like you said , its not like that country will ever been the same again . 
  it 'll be an uphill battle for years to rebuild everything that was lost . 
  sorry i should of clarified that a bit . 
  when i mean banned , professors at that university could punish a student 's grades by use of banned words that he does n't like . 
  i agree , it 's like in the us , at washington state university where professors can ban `` words '' they do n't like . 
  i do n't mean things like swear words , racism , etc. 
  literally does n't like the word women to be used for a group of women . 
  what a complete idiot . 
  also another university in the us banned sombreros for being racist . 
  question for europeans , how important is it to go to a top university in europe ? 
  i live here in us for years and where you go to university is n't that impacting unless you go to private expensive schools . 
  is the difference of getting to go to oxford compared to heidelburg that big ? 
  i know the question is a bit vague but if you want me to clarify anything let me know . 
  i remember my parents telling it was possible that russia could have integrated early on and led the charge for a similar western-styled democracy after all the years of the soviet union , but obviously that did n't happen . 
  the soviet union in some ways did n't completely die . 
  it definitely is , makes you turn gray real fast . 
  if he was willing to run again like fdr did , he would have a good chance of getting re-elected again . 
  both biden and kerry were amazing politicians that worked with obama 's administration and it 's a shame they did n't give it another go , would of done really well . 
  americans are tired of bushes and clintons , they just are . 
  she would of been fine and been in the white house if she was n't exposed for her sketchy business with the dnc . 
  this was in the bag for clinton , it was her year , she risked looking for an advantage against bernie sanders and got exposed . 
  she has n't even made the white house yet , are the american people suppose to vote for her ?

  it 's not like they 're not having sex at all . 
  they are . 
  hormones are overwhelming at that age . 
  it does n't matter if you put aoc at 14 or 18 - in both cases , the same amount of sex will be had . 
  you ca n't change that . 
  the laws are there just to make things less awkward and less illegal . 
  if at 14 you 're expected to start choosing your educational path in life , something that will shape your entire future , why ca n't you be trusted to bone as much as you 'd like , something that wo n't change anything ?

   you imagined or willingly presented him as a person who equalises communism and antifascism yes , because all the nationalist right-wing fascist lunatics are the same . 
  it 's the same old `` antifascism equals communism '' story . 
  and only true fascists can say that . 
  tito should n't have been so lenient . 
  the new minister of culture is a neo-nazi . 
  is n't that great ? 
   why ca n't you admit that croatians also committed atrocities , and that tudjman is as a war criminal as milosevic ? 
  what ? 
  we were n't talking about that at all . 
  but if it makes you feel happy - yeah , tu\u0111man was a fascist shithead as much as milo\u0161evi\u0107 , and his idea of forming a greater croatia was by no means different than the idea of forming a greater serbia . 
  but that has nothing to do with what happened to the terrorists . 
   the situation has since been resolved by croatia winning the war and ethnically cleansing the disputed territories . 
  no , that was an organized voluntary exodus of terrorists and their families . 
  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/demographics_of_rsk.jpg/800px-demographics_of_rsk.jpg ) was ethnic cleansing . 
  it was estimated that by 1995 , the area occupied was 99 + % ethnically pure . 
  in the nineties , all sides had hundreds of heavy artillery pieces , tanks , one side even had hundreds of aircraft . 
  now , 12 howitzers or an aa battery are suddenly a threat ... ?

   interestingly enough slovenians are genetically closest to slovakians - even more then they are to the rest of the yugoslavs . 
  slovenia has [ turbo polka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi7wnifbwxk ) , like the rest of the balkans has turbo folk .

  the most important thing is that the karad\u017ei\u0107 verdict will also confirm genocide in bratunac , fo\u010da , klju\u010d , prijedor , sanski most , vlasenica and zvornik . 
  dodik has a fire burning under his ass . 
  karad\u017ei\u0107 and mladi\u0107 verdicts are also due this year . 
  i say we 'll see a referendum by the end of 2016 . 
   i seriously do n't know where this fear comes from . 
  well , let 's wait and see . 
  we wo n't have to wait long . 
  probably not even until the end of 2016 . 
  there would be no such thing as `` offensive action '' . 
  croatia takes banja luka , br\u010dko and trebinje 8-12 hours after something happens to warrant an intervention . 
  serbia may , or may not , do something on its own to protect the territorial integrity of b&h and help the federation . 
  probably not , though . 
  two days later , it 's all over . 
  any type of prolonged warfare is almost impossible . 
  if serbia tries to support bosnian serbs , it 's gone as a country as we know it , and so are all the serbs from b&h . 
  that 's just light weaponry . 
  basically no heavy weapons are operational . 
  serbia can only come to the aid of the federation . 
  anything else , and 1999 looks like a walk in the park . 
  you ca n't have a war without weapons , and those are basically gone , which means 5k soldiers will quickly put a stop to everything . 
  if b&h ca n't do it , then croatia can , in 2-3 days tops . 
  no foreign invasion will be necessary . 
  the army and police of b&h will easily do the job once the time comes ( and that time might very well be before the 25th `` birthday '' ) . 
  in related news , serbian mfa gets overdosed on shitty brlja . 
  something that always amazed me is how you go through lika where it 's foggy and stupidly cold ( it always is ) , there 's no sunshine anywhere ( like , never ) , and the moment you pass velebit there is n't a single cloud in the sky and you have to switch the car 's air conditioning from heating to cooling . 
  that 's the chicken and the egg problem  theoretically , if you had many billions of $ extra ... 
  the airport is nearby , and so is the city bypass . 
  get rid of the garbage dump ( yeah , easier said than done ) and the train thingamajig , as well as build another bridge in that general area , and then you get a great commercial zone . 
  you have the bypass , the railway and the airport . 
  dugave seems to be built in a very good way . 
  get some more of that built , with a lot of trees and parks . 
  designate a large area for houses ; none are allowed more than one floor , and all of them must have large yards . 
  get natural gas and fibre to that area . 
  also place it near the canal , which will have year-round water after you 've built some dams upriver . 
  build a port . 
  there - you have a `` rich people neighbourhood '' . 
  if you look at a satellite view of the area , it 's still just a bunch of fields and low-density residential . 
  lots of space and lots of opportunities there ... 
  do you know why the expansion stopped ? 
  there 's only like 100k people living to the south of the river . 
   yes , like in southern sweden . 
  it melts within a day or so since it 's never freezing temperatures on the ground . 
  that 's weird . 
  is it because of the sea ? 
   10sec . 
  exposure , f5 .6 , iso400 nobody asked for that , so yeah , pro photographer definitely confirmed !, 
  we 'll see ... not many people generally in the world recycle things . 
  i do n't put much hope into having proper lithium recycling before it runs out : /, 
  we need a new breakthrough battery tech for that to happen . 
  lithium reserves do n't seem to be that great - about 13 million tons , which at 10 kg per car amounts to 1300 million cars . 
  car production is going up and is currently at about 75 million per year , so if we replace every organic fuel car with a lithium battery car , that 's theoretically barely above 17 years until all the lithium is gone on cars alone . 
  but we also use lithium for the production of glass and aluminium , phone batteries , medicine ... from what i know , there is nothing on the horizon to replace lithium batteries : /, 
  all of that is correct , but my personal opinion is that we should slowly start getting diesel to be more expensive than petrol , due to all the extra nasty pollution . 
  if/when all the car manufacturers improve real-world pollution , i have no issues with lowering the price again .

  `` argentina is white '' is a troll statement that implies that most of argentinian population is n't caucasian . 
  origin : argentina , compared to other south american countries , has a high percentage of caucasian population , due the low ammount of native groups that lived on the area , high ammount of immigration from european countries on the post-independence era and a low ammount of african slaves . 
  its a joke on polandball also . 
  and his flair is a black flag that says argentina is white get it ? 
  yeah but ussr still kept their part of poland but i guess your reasoning is good enough as to why it does n't count .

  i am sure there was a better way to solve that situation than beating the crap out of them ? 
  edit : welp i was going on the story i heard about a month ago that was just `` migrants have been beaten by the police '' but i still stand by what i said that police could of handled the situation better without beating them .

  um did n't the mayor of moscow burn the city down so the french army could have no respite while chasing the retreating russian army and i am fairly sure st. petersburg was your capital city then or petrovgrad as i think it was called .

  pls nerf, 
  eh i watched a segment about a cyproti national dish where a turkish guy north of the dmz claimed that :p and that caused cooperation problems between the two sides so they could n't sell it as the dish of cyprus and other nations started to copy it and sell it obviously cooperation between farmers not politicians . 
  now if you only brought this kind of enthusiasm to / r/serbia that would be great !, 
  not from cyprus or live in cyprus but i know if you go near the dmz you will get killed .

  well at least you are n't alone we have a choice between vucic and seselj and neither is appealing . 
  would the pelje\u0161ac bridge be funded by the eu ? 
  because last time i heard something about it the cost of it was pretty high . 
  did they invest in eastern poland tho ? 
  semi-autonomy . 
  we got full autonomy 20 years later . 
  well i mean one of our most famous geographers classified them as macedonians and said they are n't serbs and they were separated from serbia and made their own republic in tito 's yugoslavia and before that they were part of the vardarska banovina . 
  as for the church eh i mean i wo n't get into that .

  they are not just website . 
  they co-produce most of european movies , and some award winning us movies . 
  if you never heard about canal + than you do n't watch many movies . 
  portugal . 
  people are chill but friendly , and not stuck up like in the most of western europe . 
  yeah , it 's in serbian nationalists guidebook : `` thou must hate croats , muslims , and especially hate to read ad write serbian language '',

  that will show them .

  police there is more concerned to not look racist than to do its job . 
  remember the muslim pedophiles ring that raped like 50 girls for months and police did n't want to investigate for fear of being labeled racist ? 
  i 'm on mobile but i 'm sure you can find it easy .

  o please fuck off . 
  do you have any idea what was happening in balkans during 90s ? 
  or to my grandfathers generation the in the 40s during wwii ? 
  or for five fucking centuries from 14 to 19th century during ottoman occupation ? 
  it was nationality instead of skin color , but horrible things were very real and systematic . 
  the world is not us and being white does n't magically protect you from ethnic cleansing , systematic rape , torture and death camps that millions of * white * people suffered in the hearth of europe, 
  i 'm graphic designer . 
  no i spent a lot of time doing exactly the opposite because i want my prospective employers or clients to easily find me and my work . 
  just like millions of other white people from balkan i have seen and felt more hate , violence , poverty , war and destruction than you can imagine . 
  please do tell me more about my privilege .

  how is life generally in kosovo now ? 
  is it better after independence ? 
  i guess it suck to still need visa for traveling but other than that is anything changing for the better since getting independence ?

  i got my pothead friend from france a bunch of them on my way back from portugal , the look on his face was priceless - pure joy . 
  when you get arrested you get put into investigative prison until your trial . 
  serbia . 
  i 've been to portugal this simmer and prices are similar . 
  rent is a bit more expensive in lisboa than in belgrade but coffee and beer is a bit cheaper so it evens out  you can find similar prices in other non-eu balkan states . 
  honey schnaps with mdma . 
  nokia was incredible until someone decided to fire all their ui and ux designers with above double digit iq . 
  i hope this guys make it . 
  i did a motorcycle tour belgrade to istanbul and back one year ago , and this year i did road trip belgrade to lisbon and back . 
  * balkan countries are definitely cheapest and everything gets more expensive as you go west or east from there ( with exception of portugal ) . 
  but you being from norway will probably think everything is cheap everywhere . 
  * as long as you are not being stupid there is no real danger . 
  we spent few days at `` notorious '' marseille and could n't get why it has so bad reputation , its a very nice place . 
  * prepare a lot of small bills and coins for road tolls in france , the have tolls like every 100m or so . 
  * buy road food and drinks at supermarkets before you go , not at the gas stations , its much cheaper and selection is much better . 
  * when you stop at a gas station do everything at once : get gas , everyone goes to toilet and gets coffee . 
  no need for stopping 3 times . 
  * turkey is kind of a special place , be prepare to bargain for everything because in a lot of shops there is no price tags and cashier just decides how much he think you should pay . 
  also i am not sure how far east is safe to go in turkey , ask around before you do . 
  they will probably block much more than that soon . 
  wtf is going on in england lately ? 
  are they preparing for marshal law or something ? 
  reminds me too much of my elementary school . 
  lifting the visas few years ago was the single best thing that happened to serbia in recent history . 
  why is there 50 serbian dinars on table if this is about ukraine ? 
  probably because snorting with 50 dinar bill is the lowest you can go . 
  cool maps but bear in serbian is medved ( without j ) . 
  i used firefox until i started having problems with flash video and res . 
  switched to chrome because it works like it should . 
  lol . 
  when you live in serbia this sounds like first world problems . 
  should have included balkans . 
  serbia topped all countries in the world with 2,861 cigarettes smoked per capita . 
  they defeated fellow balkan countries bulgaria ( # 2 -- 2,822 ) and greece ( # 3 2,795 ) . 
  i would say around 50 % of people i know have guns at home . 
  i have shoot different guns and rifles , some at shooting range some at countryside . 
  had few gun pointed at me by people that im pretty sure are n't a police but are definitely some kind of authority . 
  if you have read the short article you would know it 's just a clickbait , they are there to build the fence .

  add some night watch just in case . 
  right ... 
  recent ? 
  serbia has been in conflict with muslims for half a millennium . 
  but that does n't mean people ca n't relate to another person . 
  la haine has a cult status in belgrade , [ here is an interesting vice article about it . 
  ] ( https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/hanging-out-with-belgrades-la-haine-obsessives-322 ), 
  lol , have you been to egypt ? 
  it 's because * preko * means over and * sutra * is tomorrow so * preko-sutra * means over , on top of tomorrow . 
  because we live in fucking mordor .

  source ? 
  ok well the answer is : yes , empires get mad when competing empires try and take over their spheres of influences/vassals, 
  what an opening line by the journalist, 
   are you saying that us does n't like russia making countries changing there allegiance ? 
  ... do you really need someone to confirm this to you, 
  i have no understanding of the situation besides a few stats and quotes mentioned in passing about women outnumbering men at a lot of western universities would you mind explaining it to me , or giving me some resources to look into ? 
  honest request, 
  men should get custody more often though and i do n't think you only get alimony if you are stay-at-home . 
  divorce laws are all kinds of fucked up , and sexist to the core . 
  i think what he is trying to say is that your current day core values are very christian-influenced and that because we 've been raised in them we ca n't see them for what they are , secular offshoots of christianity, 
  i do n't know much about venezuela , were there any sanctions on them ? 
  why would there be , just because of socialist 's being in power ? 
  right ? 
  aesthetically the best assembly in europe tbh france 's palais de luxembourg is close second, 
  nah my grandma ( the one that had the doll ) is slovene , where the native variety of `` krampus '' is called parkelj, 
  not gon na lie i am , to this day , terrified of this shit my grandma had a little krampus doll in her house it was so fucking scary every time i went there as a kid i avoided it, 
  venezuela ? 
  damn you 're either crazy or really bored, 
  like personally him ? 
  or are you making a meme ? 
   officially have stated many times that they have absolutely nothing against serbia joining eu . 
  i believe you but do you have a source for those official statements ? 
  why you so mad at putin though, 
  logical consistency = / = making sense, 
  they are impure on earth clean in heaven for reasons that make sense within the context of islam it 's a lot of things but it is n't logically inconsistent, 
  kosovo is already outside of our borders though , whether we like it or not, 
  kosovo was always a financial black hole , even back in the ottoman period, 
  tell me , what about that ( eternal reward in heaven for something you abstained from on earth ) does n't make sense ? 
  you may not agree with it , i do n't either , but within the framework of islam it makes 100 % sense, 
   ( which is exactly what happened in crimea ) . 
  is there a video somewhere ? 
  it does violate human rights, 
  at this point there is no better option really, 
  lmao you were n't kidding they should have written what his name is, 
   is left there to their devices , russia would have made sure yugoslavia survived no ? 
  yugoslavia was actually pretty good at keeping russian influence at bay . 
  if anything russia was , just like the others , happy to see a breakdown because it could then be able to , in the absence of any real unity in the region after dissolution , absorb a few of the now weak new countries into its sphere of influence . 
  you put it into words better than i did , thank you, 
  once again i 'm not denying that france has benefited from non-ethnically french immigrants , obviously it has . 
  i was just wondering about the implications of `` diversity is what makes us strong '' just do n't call it diversity of genes , because that implies that race exists . 
  yes but they rejected france and their french identity when they were alive , as do others alive today i was questioning this line :  if you are born french , then your values should not matter . 
  come on man you know what i was asking are you trying to imply that , for example , a `` fran\u00e7ais de souche '' having children with an black person would result in `` better offspring '' than if the ethnically french had children with another ethnically french person ? 
  getting a little too close to `` race realism '' for comfort there my friend, 
  what does diversity of genes mean ? 
  none , which is why i started my original comment with `` out of curiosity '' my curiosity was piqued by your use of the oft-repeated `` diversity makes x great/strong '' and i was wondering what that sentence really meant and its implications etc, 
  yeah i 'm really not talking about genocide that 's obviously really bad but i was just wondering , because you always hear people apologizing multiculturalism by saying that diversity is precisely what makes the community strong/powerful/great , is that the only way for a country/community to be great ? 
  like what if someone came from a place where people are really homogenous ethnically , is that a sign of the place 's weakness ? 
   if you want to obtain the french citizenship you have to agree to its values . 
  if you are born french , then your values should not matter . 
  i also do n't understand what you 're trying to say by this , do you think that because the kouachi brothers and the 13th november terrorists were all either french/belgian-born , the fact that they lived in parallel worlds of anti-republicanism and reactionary islamic fundamentalism is not a problem ? 
  do you think islamists , nazis , etc. 
  are n't a threat to the republic and its values ? 
   that 's what makes france great . 
  out of curiosity , is there any other way for a country to be great than to accept literally anyone with the passport , regardless of the allegiance or values or identity of the person , as `` theirs '', 
  that delicious fish soup man brings me back, 
  ayy more old europe !, 
  ooh true my bad, 
  dogs are unchanging through years , places , and social classes . 
  they always just do what a dog does . 
  same as cats . 
  there are a shitton of croats who would disagree with you , judging by the fact that a very high number of early yugoslavists were croat subjects of austria-hungary . 
  now whether you dislike socialism as opposed to monarchy and capitalism that 's another subject of contention, 
  moreover most people in these photographs are not slavs , but caucasians , central asian turkic peoples , etc. 
  haha ye the downvotes you got are ridiculous but there is no changing reddit 's voting habits, 
  whether an empire is nicer to me or my people ( and i consider all south slavs my people , and have great respect for all other neighbors that were oppressed by the various empires that ruled us , no divisive nationalism here , only an anti-imperial one ) does n't change the fact that they were empires , oppressive by design . 
  peaceful dissolution would have been preferable , but as you said tough luck getting the rich and powerful in vienna to honor a petition or something like that . 
  same goes for the ottomans . 
  they came here by force and ruled us for hundreds of years , suppressing any dissent against them often violently . 
  it was tough to fight back but a lot of great men and women from various parts of the balkan did , and bravely so , for many many years before we got self-rule . 
  now people like to blame princip and his group for `` ruining the united states of austria plan that the great archduke was going to give you plebs '' but how the fuck was he supposed to expect that to happen ? 
  after 500 + years of various imperial domination you get pretty cynical about massa 's promises . 
  in his own words , he '' [ is ] the son of peasants and [ knows ] what is happening in the villages . 
  that is why [ he ] wanted to take revenge , and [ he regrets ] nothing . '', 
  furthermore , another thing the early nationalists ( which , i repeat , are in a completely different league than the reactionary shitfest of the 90s ) can not absolutely be blamed for wwii , nazis , stalin , etc. 
  because a ) how the fuck could they know and b ) who knows maybe it would have happened anyway , or something worse could have happened . 
  historical what-ifs never end . 
  i hold that princip , young bosnia , the illyrian movement , and other early nationalists are heroes and should be honored by any liberty-loving south slav . 
  final point leninism and stalinism are n't really in the same league either . 
  stalinism is the one you might want to criticize , lenin did n't do anything evil . 
  i will ask for personal nuclear icbm launcher to help destroy fascist ukraine government and isis, 
  i get what you mean , i feel the same way whenever i visit a small village . 
  this one time i visited a monastery where they live the same lives as monks from the 1st century , it was surreal . 
  of course a monk 's life is different from a commoner 's but there is definitely an ... organic quality ? 
  to their lives that is completely absent from ours . 
  i do n't know how to say it exactly but a lot of them seem to be much more satisfied with what they are doing . 
  once again these guys were monks so they 're really spiritual men and entirely committed to what they are doing but it 's really interesting to see the different ways a human life can be spent . 
  thank putin putin yes yes putin putin pls give me dog, 
   transylvania ok hungarian person , 
  true , if any of you ever have the chance to meet an old-school peasant from a really undeveloped part of the world observe their clothes ( perhaps touch them if they let you ) they 're really fucking rough . 
  though they do have some rustic charm, 
  since when were all germans tried at nuremberg, 
  says a guy from sweden , of course to you guys that 's how it looks  in all seriousness though it was a terrible war but necessary for the disenfranchised people of the balkans and eastern europe . 
  i mean it 's funny to imagine a babylonian angrily stamping `` fuck you asshole ! '', 
  in cuneiform into a clay tablet but i think it was probably something more like a breach of contract or a lawsuit , at least whatever a formal complaint was required to look like according to hammurabi 's code, 
  not here !, 
  prokudin-gorsky actually pioneered color photography in the early 20th century so the colors match reality , though the saturation is obviously amped up ( due to the limitations of the technique ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sergey_prokudin-gorsky, 
  yes !, 
  the famous one, 
  [ another one from around that time ] ( http://i2.wp.com/laughingsquid.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/yyi3n5icrop.jpg?fit=750%2c981 ), 
  lmao the very mainstream marxist one , the three bullet points in the wiki page for bourgeoisie are n't really equal in relevance,

  they do n't wear arab clothing or hijab . 
  or if a woman wears a headscarf it 's not guaranteed that she 's muslim , just that she 's conservative . 
   for example that gay sex is a sin . 
  even though it 's not even mentioned in the bible it 's mentioned in leviticus, 
  the same thing is happening in indonesia . 
  it used to be a multinational , multireligious country ( well , it still is ) and then the saudis started importing their fucked up ideas . 
  luckily the majority population still hates the extremists , but i feel this is changing the same way as in bosnia . 
  the pork thing was actually the practice in the serbian army until it was professionalized a few years back . 
  frankly i think it 's disgusting and discriminatory to force people to eat food against their religious beliefs . 
  that 's funny , every dutch person i know complains about muslims being too loud or violent or rude or xxx, 
  but you have n't answered my question : how do you deal with foreigners not wanting to assimilate into your culture ? 
  one of the reasons is certainly racism , but it 's not actually racism because muslims are not a race ( they are hated because of their culture , so i 'm not sure what 's the proper word for it ) . 
  the people that fought in ww2 are still around , their children are not so openly racist but the majority do believe that they are better than everyone else because they were born french/german/hungarian etc. 
  so you belong to the perfect nation and have a kick-ass economy and your trains run on time and you do n't flush your toilet after 10pm to not disturb your neighbors . 
  but then this asshole comes along who talks loud on his mobile phone after midnight and his wife scares the children with her ninja outfit . 
  i 'm not sure how you guys deal with this in canada , do you tolerate it or call the police ? 
  where 's slovenia ? 
  when i read the title i thought this would be about sweden . 
  they 've been qualified to join the euro since its beginning , right ? 
  immigrants are n't brainless retards , those that get into western europe are actually above-average so it 's not surprising they can outsmart the police . 
  not a very interesting map i must say : /, 
  maybe you 're being 1000 times more productive than a normal individual . 
  let 's say you 're friends with the ceo of gazprom , then you can potentially be 1000 times more money-worthy than an average person who does n't have that connection . 
  i never really liked the idea that all people should get equal pay . 
  if you 're not capable of finishing college , building up a network and becoming a top executive like these guys , then it 's your own fault , not theirs . 
  edit : holy shit when did this subreddit turn into a hippy circlejerk ? 
   all governments make contingency plans lol you should read more about the serb government , they even get surprised when the snow falls every year and traffic collapses ( and i 'm not making this up ), 
  i do n't think the plans are for * conquering * russia or china , just defeating them . 
  conquering for territory is not really important right now ; maybe the us would ask for some gas fields etc. 
  spain and france are us allies , they should allow us troops to cross their territory when invading andorra . 
  an attack on israel would probably include bases in turkey , a carrier in the mediterranean and maybe some assistance from egypt . 
  there are many foreign devils living in china, 
  as it has been said before , this only shows muslims lack imagination when picking names . 
  i must remember to go to la tomatina next year !, 
  ok so they 're not illyrians , maybe they 're [ dacians or thracians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albanian_language ) - they still were living in kosovo before the slavs came . 
  or maybe you think they came * after * ? 
  there were 2 ( two ) battles at kosovo polje . 
  in the first battle the serbs were defeated by the turks . 
  then [ 50 years later ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kosovo_%281448%29 ) the hungarians were defeated at the same place by the turks and their serb allies . 
  the battles then moved more to the north , for example in 1456 the [ battle of belgrade ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_belgrade_%281456%29 ) , it is recorded that a large part of the christian army was orthodox ( = serb ) . 
  there were no battles in kosovo until the austrians visited it in 1699 i think . 
  that 's a fucking retarded logic but you would lose by it too . 
  kosovo was serb land only between 1150-1389 ( 250 years ) , then it was turkish land for 500 years . 
  so the turks have more right to it than you . 
  and before the serbs came to the balkans there were illyrians and greeks living there . 
  guess who are the ancestors of the albanians ? 
  a wiser man than myself once said this : we did n't like vllasi so we got rugova . 
  we did n't like rugova so we got thaci . 
  because the milosevic regime always replied with opression , the moderates lost power among the albanians in favor of the extremists . 
  it 's not like the albanians chose to start killing policemen for no reason , they did that only after a decade of begging for autonomy , when the moderates lost all power . 
  the kla is not at all innocent ( as evidenced by their organ trade ) , but many soldiers joined their ranks not because they were drug traders but because they wanted to fight for a better life . 
  these people then left the kla after the war was over and only the criminals remained . 
  whether it was their strategy to win by provoking milosevic or not , it obviously worked . 
  is the official turkish census from 1911 good enough ? 
  the link 's here somewhere , i replied to someone else ... 
  did n't the portuguese lose most of their colonies and wealth the last time they were together with the spanish ? 
  80 % of those that did vote voted for impeachment . 
  so i guess this is bad news ? 
  i fucking hate it when referendums fail due to low turnout . 
  and then people that did n't vote complain about how democracy does n't work ... 
  fine , here 's the official turkish statistics from 1911 : http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/kosovo/chap2.htm  according to turkish statistics , 912,902 inhabitants lived in the vilayet of kosova , out of whom 743,040 were albanians , 53,396 bulgarians , 106,209 serbs , 20,009 jews and 5,043 romanies . 
  of course , serb historians attacked this official data as well because they did n't count women ( though i ca n't see how counting them would favor the monogamous christians ) , so here are some other estimates as well : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_vilayet#demographics  british journalist h. brailsford estimated in 1906 that two-thirds of the population of kosovo was albanian and one-third serbian . 
  the most populous western districts of \u0110akovica and pe\u0107 were said to have between 20,000 and 25,000 albanian households , as against some 5,000 serbian ones . 
  a map of alfred stead , published in 1909 , shows that similar numbers of serbs and albanians were living in the territory . 
   a publication from december 21 , 1912 in the belgian magazine ons volk ontwaakt ( our nation awakes ) estimated 827,100 inhabitants :   muslim albanians - 418,000   christian bulgarians - 250,000   orthodox serbs - 113,000   mixed - 22,000   muslim bulgarians - 14,000   muslim turks - 9,000   orthodox vlachs - 900   orthodox greeks - 200, 
   although it did n't seem to have much impact did it , the albanian language is alive and well is n't it wtf ?? 
  was this some weak attempt at trolling ? 
  more like 1300 . 
  in 1500 it was the forehead of ottoman empire . 
   oppressed not only albanians in kosovo , but the entirety of people in serbia that opposed him . 
  did you learn in school in your own language ? 
  yes ? 
  then obviously you had a better life than an albanian kid in kosovo . 
  the `` opression '' the serbs lived under milosevic was nothing compared to the war crimes committed against the albanians in kosovo . 
  maybe if milosevic murdered all serbs in a village because they opposed him , maybe then i would agree with you . 
  maybe if milosevic closed schools because they were teaching in serbian , or closed libraries because the books were in serbian . 
  but because we all know the opression that serbs lived under was just some lack of media freedom , some random murder of maffia guys , some problems at the border when you tried to smuggle petrol , you ca n't fool people into believing that the serbs and albanians lived under the same measure of opression . 
  here 's one : http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/feb/26/kosovo.serbia  orthodox serb population at less than 25 % there are many more sources in serbian , do your own search . 
  edit : awesome , i 'm getting downvoted now for providing source ? 
  the serb nationalistic element is strong within this thread . 
   gtfo back to albanistan . 
  they did n't come from albanistan , the serbs conquered their land and then opressed them for the next hundred years before they finally gained their freedom . 
  kosovo was majority albanian ever since it was annexed by serbia in 1912 . 
  read more about history : http://lamar.colostate.edu/~grjan/kosovohistory.html  in the first balkan war of 1912 albania was attacked by montenegro , serbia , bulgaria and greece . 
  the albanians were allied with the ottomans . 
  serbs joined the army in large numbers to avenge the serbian defeat by the turks at the battle of kosovo polje . 
  at this time kosovo was mostly albanian . 
  serbs entered pristina as albanians retreated to the mountains . 
  the serbian army destroyed turkish and albanian houses and there was much plundering and killing . 
  serb peasants followed the army into kosovo re-occupying the land . 
  the albanians fought fiercely but lost the war and kosovo came under serbian authority . 
  that 's a naive view of history . 
  ever since kosovo 's autonomy was forcibly abolished in 1990 and the albanian leader [ put to jail ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/azem_vllasi ) , the albanian majority was severely supressed in their right , to the point that they could n't even learn in school in their own language , and more than 14000 elementary schools were forcibly closed [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/kosovo/kosovo-background24.htm ) . 
  albanians were prohibited from buying land from serbs [ [ 2 ] , first paragraph on page 2 ] ( http://www.osce.org/kosovo/36815 ) . 
  in every town the government was made of serbs , even in those where the serbs made 0 % of the population ( this is because albanians boycotted all elections in the 90 ` es ) . 
  street signs were similarly named of serb famous people . 
  albanian newspapers were shut down . 
  there were mass protests by the albanians which were supressed by tanks . 
  and we have n't even got to 1998 when the albanians finally gave up dialog and started armed rebellion . 
  this is when the massacres started .

  compared to middle-east , north-african or arab ones . 
  are you serious ? 
  yes . 
  oh please , they sold to you alaska and you still complain ? 
  as i know the word `` hrvat '' should have a meaning like man from mountains or serbian man from mountains . 
  but i used it just as a joke . 
   serbo croatian you just triggered the * mountain serbs * . 
  look , op discovered the warm water . 
  in whole europe slot machines are basically owned by the state government . 
  edit : mhe i wrote something wrong , please love me anyway . 
  looks like some one noticed the one in rostov and called the police : http://cs8.pikabu.ru/images/previews_comm/2016-09_4/1474199458156875424.png, 
  wait wait wait , russian election commission has received reports of vote fraud from one city in siberia and a rumor about a part in moscow . 
  then no international observers from osce has still reported anything wrong , and if there will be something illegal they will report it monday 19 september : https://www.oscepa.org/news-a-media/press-releases/2589-international-election-observers-in-russia-to-hold-press-conference-on-monday now , i 'm honestly not sure what to believe , the editorialized news or the osce observers ? 
  ** edit ** illegal actions recorded in rostov : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abkgteczouc police has been called : http://cs8.pikabu.ru/images/previews_comm/2016-09_4/1474199458156875424.png, 
  yes and so ? 
  any objective persone would be ok with that . 
  that ' t not the case of norway , the data that you can check is only the taxes you pay , that 's different . 
  nha mate , we are talking about taxes , something that by law you must pay to live and get services from the country , something that everyone must do to improve their country , especially in a country that works properly as norway . 
  every one knows that you pay taxes , every one does it as well , and in the end it 's simply money , nothing less or more . 
  it 's not your health condition , it 's not about who you fuck , it 's about money . 
  it 's simply a bunch of numbers as they are the kms that you do with your car every year . 
  basically nothing to hide or be bothered of .

  here we go , another one painting the world in back and white . 
  sweet summer child , if only the * reality * would be like that . 
  you folks with agenda biased accounts should start to be more creative . 
  so the cause of that is some alliance commander idiot that wanted to get rid of all that shit ? 
  i think that we are arrived at the point where they would be even happy if it happens , for how much someone keep saying it . 
  lol this thread . 
  mhe , denying their problems by blaming serbia is a classic . 
   milosevic was a genocidal scum you should read newspapers once or two you know . 
   the f-35 oh please spare me the thing about cooperation , that plane was invented only because the us banned the export of the f22 and the eu countries started to cry about it . 
  now i 'm not saying that is not a good jet or else , but with the time and the costs it took to develop , things went just retarded . 
  i still do n't get why eu did n't cooperated like the tornado and the eurofighter project , i do n't get why they di n't worked with saab , dassault aviation or other european aviation companies , which are not few . 
  no , instead they went to other side of the ocean , to take a plane that was the downgrading of another one , that had already delays and problems and do what ? 
  add more stuff which caused more delays , more problems and more costs . 
  yes , look at what marvelous job that european countries did in libya , literally shit . 
  oh please , do n't make me laugh . 
  mmm yeah sure , then tell me in the past 30 years where this `` collaboration and command '' was started from an eu country when it was time for a military intervention ? 
  i 'll answer for you : never . 
  usa always started military interventions and other nato countries followed ( mostly ) like sheep . 
  even in libya usa participated dude , nato is just a usa thing , they decide when to wage war and which things ( like f35s ) other countries should buy for military `` standardization '' or in other words , how to allow american weapon industries to get more money . 
  lol , believe it . 
  a guess this will be a new course in communication universities . 
  meanwhile in israel people started to shake uncontrollably until the ground itself started to tremble . 
  on the coastal line of the country a series of isles emerged from the sea , on the photos taken by satellites the landmass created a form that looks like the word * triggered * . 
  holy shit , the usta\u0161e that were recorded calling him on the phone are gon na go crazy . 
  finally some fucking common sense in explaining what is serbia . 
  yep . 
  i agree , mods listen to this guy !, 
  as the other guy said , nazism is banned in germany , communism ideas etc. 
  is not in russia , also because they had it until 1990 and now banning it would be kinda pointless if not impossible . 
  since stalin killed even more people of hitler but he 's one of the victorious leaders of ww2 with the country as well , trying to ban everything related to him would have been an enormous task , but condemning his terrible acts it 's something already done from his successors and from actual russia now , is a small thing but at least it 's a step toward stopping glorifying him . 
  and ? 
  but , why ? 
  triggering jews since 1939 . 
  mhe that was kinda stupid , just do n't turn this thread into `` teachers in russia praise stalin !!! '' . 
  generalizing over 144 million country population it 's not objective . 
  looks like . 
   there 's a little bit of blood on the paper do you know that this is extremely dangerous ? 
  getting a cut on the anus is the perfect way to get an infection , since your shit touches the bruised skin and bacteria from what you have digested enter in your blood .

  i 've missed it :(, 
  putin ? 
  facts \u2260 your russophobia . 
  have a nice day . 
  yes mate , putin just called me on the phone and told me what to write . 
  russia does not violate other countries airspace , they get close , same dose usa to russia . 
  and for the love of god do n't even try to use as reference the kaliningrad and st.petersburg zone , since you should now that there airspace of the countries basically overlaps and a jet fly kind fast you know . 
  keep living in a cave believing that russia will invade you then , for fucks sake . 
   croatian flag  writes `` bre '' i 'm confused :o, 
  hey dude , learn to read . 
   usa sends airplanes close and inside russian territory since 1945 . 
  it 's not whataboutism , it 's that they do it each other from more that 70 years , but only when one side does it , all you keyboard knights go apeshit . 
  you should also remember that until the urals , russia is basically flat and plain . 
  mmm so according to r/europe when a russian jet goes near other countries border it 's warmongering and bla bla bla , but when it 's a usa spy plane everything is fine ? 
  nice double standards folks . 
  edit : since we have so many keyboard knights , usa sends airplanes close and inside russian territory since 1945 , the same does russia with nato countries , the fact is that when russia does it you all go batshit crazy , when usa does it , russia does not give a fuck , they intercept the plane and thats it . 
  ( well once they shot down one in the 50s or 60s but it was deep inside soviet territory ) . 
  holy fuck, 
  see , always the jews behind it . 
  are you talking about the baltic states and their paranoia about russia ? 
  sorry but they are biased at best . 
  on my personal point of view usa military was needed after ww2 and during cold war , when european countries were rebuilding and restarting their economies . 
  now we are in 2016 , even after the 2009 recession most of the countries are growing and getting better , all of them have their own military that is more or less modernized and working . 
  at the same time since 9/11 we all know how usa escalated their * democracy exports * and what are the actual results ( the actual almost civil war in afghanistan , the actual retarded iraq , how all the fighters they trained in the past now turned to isis or other terrorist groups , syria and libya ) . 
  europe need to be independent from usa in how we decide our future , look at ttpi , at apple taxes , at how usa wants to amass troops and missiles close to russia , this for me is bad , it creates tensions , it makes us submissive to them ( have you read how in the states they reacted about ttpi canceling and apple taxes ? 
  they think we are little shits with no rights to decide for our self ) . 
  we are sovereign countries living together deciding together our future , without the influence of a country on the other end of the ocean . 
  because europe should stop be dependent on usa military . 
  lol keep living under the tin foil hat . 
  before u/lordderplythethird answered me you could n't be 100 % sure that was russian , after he gave the reference of the picture . 
  sorry but there is no way to prove that plane is from russian aviation . 
  the airplane is used also by algeria , iran , syria , sudan , kazakhstan and ukraine . 
   their planes are simply so old lol , inform your self a bit .

  are there lots of muslims in slovenia ? 
  they werent forced to leave they were just given bosnian muslim names , this does a good job of explaining it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djrnezgnj7y,

  also they built massive fucking mosques from dat saudi skrilla,

  soviet was best thing that happened to baltics, 
  germoney gib greece wwii war reparations !, 
  alexander is of slav, 
  russia saved you all from hitlers boot, 
  well done, 
  the largest investment in kosovo to date !, 
  wow what did that guy with a single ak hope to achieve ? 
  thats not very funny . 
  i know some people in bosnia with holes in their homes from the last war , you shouldnt laugh at this . 
  why was communism so horrible in the balkans but not in yugoslavia , what went so right ? 
  and ^ then ^ so ^ wrongggg, 
  there was no genocide in kosovo only in srebrenica, 
  as soon as armenians get statues to honor the genocide victims of the turks . 
  how long you gon na keep milking this ? 
  but they want the west to pay for them , just like everything else, 
  thaci should n't hold his breath or maybe he should actually, 
  fuck yeah america does n't put up with this shit . 
  take note europe this is how you stop the terrorists . 
  create an event that will knowingly piss em off then bam !, 
  then why do you guys keep voting them in if the hdz are so awful ? 
  and why does the croatian far right make themselves the victim of tito ? 
  titos pretty well liked here . 
  oh that makes sense then yah it does sound like hdz nonsense . 
  why whats wrong with her ? 
  i havnt really read anything on her, 
  do you want an extra +77 million muslims ? 
  sure why not , most of israels jewry is of european descent anyway, 
  what ? 
  is that what nigel farage has been telling you ? 
  i wanted to emphasize the `` we dont care '', 
  oh so its okay when they do such a thing but when we do it its not ? 
  double standards huh, 
  right tell that to the albanians then . 
   coming into other peoples countries and declaring republics buddy serbs didnt come into anything , they had already lived in croatia and bosnia for centuries . 
   get genocided by my supposed `` brothers '' in my own country . 
  get off it, 
  just cause they support putin doesnt mean they hate europeans , no ? 
  yeah well goli otok got results . 
  he shut up nationalist voices and it kept the country together for some 40 years . 
  kept ethnic tensions down , had he not done that imo the yugoslav wars of the 90s would have happened much sooner . 
  its hard to make a decision that does not have an adverse effect on everyone . 
  it is hard to organize and rebuild a country especially when youve got 6 different republics and 10 different nationalities with no clear majority . 
  im sure now the marshall plan looks good 60 years later but at the moment you can not say you would have chosen marshall aid . 
  yeah raised our int ' standing . 
  i met the indian ambassador to canada and he asked me if i was serbian and told me his first and favorite posting was in yugoslavia . 
  he spoke the language fluently and and told me how much he loved being there during the 60 's and 70 's . 
  told how much prestige yugoslavia had on the world stage by being an open communist state compared to the rest and how great it was to live there . 
  also yugosalvai was respected for not invading hungary in the 50 's and granting their elite asylum and staying out of the invasion of czechoslovakia . 
   royalty wut lol ? 
  really haha ?? 
  u actually believe that ???? 
   right . 
  he was just a degenerate that preached socialist values while fucking american actresses . 
  building a cult of personality around him and all the fucking peasants believed him . 
  man knew how to party , kennedy did the same things and almost broguht nuclear war but today he is an american saint haha . 
  tito just tried to unite us through the brotherhood and unity idea and create a yugoslav people instead of serbs , croats , slovenes etc just like the prussians , bavarians , saxons united to create germans he figured why couldnt we ? 
  he had the right idea we 're all just too stubborn to go with it . 
  yeah it was maybe propaganda but it was better to be one strong state than 6 ( or 7 ) small irrelevant states . 
  yeah well bush had a 90 % approval rate in 2001 and 2004 . 
  start a war and theyll jsut love you . 
   russians are willing to be european and cooperate with all of us as equals . 
  i think mos russians already do but their leaders dont, 
  oh no boobs !, 
  did a black man get shot there too ? 
  whyd you split in the first place then, 
  how ? 
  he kept nationalism and nationalist voices down , rebuilt and organized yugoslavia , created an actual economy with industry , raised yugosalvias international standing , created a pretty good military . 
  he wasnt a crazy commie dictator like caucescu , hoxha , honecker etc. 
  yugoslavs were allowed to travel anywhere and watch or listen to anything . 
  he really was not anything like stalin bruh . 
  more like complaints department, 
  i dont think tito was their puppet , he kept us clear of the ussr, 
  war department, 
  isnt it bad to build over archeological sites ? 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  well theyre both equally shitty people then, 
   the atmosphere in serbia is not really pro-eu in the population wut ? 
  we dont even have any anti-eu eurosceptic parties . 
  not joining in on russian sanctions does not make us love russia . 
  germans raped their way through europe too ... 
  lies, 
  millwall fc chant `` no one likes us , no one likes us , no one likes us , we dont care , we dont care '',

limes , my man !, 
  of course i was complaining . 
  of course nato made it all worse , because most of the war crimes happened * after * the bombing campaign started . 
  it was n't all roses before the war , but hey , you had a terrorist organization back then trying to break away from the country . 
  they were killing serbian police officers and soldiers , but also civilians and anyone who opposed to them ( lake radonji\u0107 massacre ) . 
  the serbian army retaliated , but there was no ethnic cleansing in , say , 1988 . 
  and you were inviting enlightened debate in that thread with your remarks ? 
  yes , i remember you were very civil . 
  yeah , go ahead and compare dresden with , say , novi sad , and therefore nazis with serbs . 
  that 's just inane , the amount of war crimes is simply incomparable between the two . 
  what ? 
  where did i downplay the actions of milosevic , or claimed that he did n't have to be stopped ? 
  since you took the time to reply to a couple of my comments ... 
  i 'm well aware that there were many crimes on our side , that 's why many serbian politicians and generals were sent to hague . 
  however , no one is talking shit about kla . 
  zmijojed provided a list of links , so let me ask you , who 's responsible for those massacres ? 
  you ca n't just let it slide . 
  and nato mission was a disgrace . 
  hell , they bombed [ civilian bridges ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varvarin#nato_attack ) , they bombed [ albanian convoys ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_bombing_of_albanian_refugees_near_%c4%90akovica ) , killing more than seventy people , but that was an accident ** lol ** , let 's move on , they used depleted uranium , cluster bombs , and if you still think s ` all good , get your head examined . 
  my head is fine , i know serbian paramilitary troops were acting like beasts in kosovo , i know milosevic was a nationalistic bastard , but that does n't mean we 're the only bad guys . 
  time will tell , i guess . 
  kosovo will have to deal with some pretty heavy accusations , like organ trafficking for example . 
  and they bombed a bridge in [ varvarin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varvarin#nato_attack ) , killing ten people . 
  what 's that you say , the risk of civilian death is low ? 
  are you questioning nato ?!?!?!, 
  do n't you know nato is like god , it moves in mysterious ways . 
  yes , in fact you do need the court . 
  the number of albanian victims is up to debate , because it is somewhere between 3,000 and 10,533 . 
  now , that 's a large scale , do n't you think ? 
  and before i forget , that information is from wikipedia , since y' all like to link from there . 
  no man , we do n't talk about casualties on the serbian side , it has to be black and white !, 
  bring on the downvotes . 
  pretend ? 
  i admitted there were crimes and atrocities , you moron . 
  so , you already know there 's been a genocide in croatia ? 
  there 's is an ongoing trial , still no results , but you already know it 's a genocide ? 
  as for kosovo , i only corrected you when it comes to labeling it a genocide , i never said there were no crimes . 
  as for your tone towards the end , wow . 
  you 're not really capable of having a discussion , are you ? 
  i wo n't get down to your level . 
  what genocide are you referring to ? 
  please provide a source . 
  yes , there was ethnic cleansing in kosovo , but there was no genocide . 
  do n't just throw that term around . 
  it 's logistics and what 's that other thing , prevention ? 
  that 's how the west sees it , right ? 
  i feel so better now . 
  novi sad is about 500 kilometers away from pristina , so there * must * be a flow of goods coming from that city , let 's destroy the bridges and refineries and radio television novi sad and everything that gets in the way !, 
  in that case , please explain why nato would bomb the whole country , when the army is based in the south and * the conflict is in kosovo , * not vojvodina or some place else .

   i ` ts like accusing the ally army for commiting crimes against the nazis . 
  what a stupid comparison . 
  i guess kla was the ally army here , right . 
  :') thank you for amusing me . 
   removal of almost a million people in an ethnic cleanisng operation that number is highly inflated . 
  still , we have taken our share of the blame , since many serbian officials were charged with crimes against humanity . 
  what about albanians in the hague , are they all completely innocent ? 
  haradinaj and the lot , they 're the good guys ? 
   albanians involved in the drug dealing business contributed their 3 % ( or more ) just like everyone else oh , so it 's ok then , it was for the right cause ? 
  drug money , organ trafficking , it does n't really matter as long as we 're fighting for independence ? 
  you say `` it 's easy to throw mud , '' like i 'm attacking something holy here , and not a terrorist organization kla really is . 
  i can only hope john clint williamson will come up with some results in his ongoing investigation about the crimes committed on the albanian side . 
  i 'm pretty sure there were some . 
  i 'm not denying that kosovo wanted to be independent for quite some time , but * it is a fact * that it was a province and a part of serbia before 2008 . 
  to be clear , i 'm not saying that kosovo and crimea are the same . 
  however , what troubles me here is this part :  there has been no ethnic cleansing , no mass murder or centralized and systematic violence [ in crimea ] indicating that such crimes only happened on serbian side . 
  how wrong you are . 
  kla was seen as a terrorist organization even by cia , funded by drug money and who knows what else . 
  there were crimes on both sides . 
  when albanians saw they were not getting their independence freely , they got violent . 
  many serbian police officers and civilians were killed at the time ( before ra\u010dak massacre ) . 
  and later on , when the west supported them , they started committing crimes against humanity . 
  why ca n't [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_unrest_in_kosovo ) be called ethnic cleansing ? 
  how do you explain that ? 
  was it the right thing to do from this perspective ? 
  let 's just wait and see . 
  i 'm kinda skeptical when it comes to that , because every time a province/country breaks away from serbia , everything 's fine , but when serbs demand equal rights , they are denied . 
  ergo , you can have an independent kosovo , but ca n't have an independent republika srpska . 
   kosovo followed slovenia , croatia , bosnia and fyrom 's examples in breaking away from a failed state you ca n't really compare federal republics with a province . 
  preach it , brother !, 
   then anybody can move and live where ever they want anyway . 
  i hope that applies to republika srpska . 
  equal rights for everyone . 
  u wot m8, 
  now that has to be one of the most stupid comments i read here . 
  what a moron you are . 
  let me make this clear : i 'm * not * pro-russian , but i am against one-sided opinions . 
  as far as i can see , people are being downvoted here just for having a different perspective . 
  i would like to see a more balanced discussion on this sub , that 's all i 'm saying . 
  i 'm from that very city , so i know what it 's like to try and cross the danube when every single bridge is bombed down . 
  and no , i 'm not trying to evoke sympathy here . 
   you release that depleted uranium means nothing ?

  i added it , but you could also have just selected `` other '' and typed it in yourself . 
  fixed !, 
  also , how does everyone feel about doing small polls of maybe 3-4 questions about a `` hot '' topic every month ? 
  a good example would be the current prism issue or recent immigration issues . 
  it would be something simple like : 1 ) your country . 
  2 ) your stance on whatever . 
  3 ) some other question . 
  at the end of every month we have another small poll about a new topic ( no shortage of those ) , and release an infographic of the last one . 
  i think it 'd be a good way to see what countries stand where , and where we as a community stand on things in the news . 
  just an idea , so i 'm open to suggestions . 
  agreed . 
  it 's also partly thaci 's fault :  `` the reasons for my resignation are the disagreements and the criticism by pm hashim thaci towards me , '' peci wrote . 
  if you 're using gmail , a quick-fix option is encrypting all of your email and accessing it in a client like thunderbird to be able to decrypt and read it . 
  the downside is that you ca n't read gmail on the web ( unless there is a firefox/chromium extension that decrypts gpg on the fly ) , and that you can only read your mail from computers which have your private key present on them . 
  the upside is that gmail ca n't semantically analyze your mail to give you relevant ads , and just ca n't read your email at all , plain and simple . 
  however , it will still be able to read messages sent to you , so like op suggests , convincing your contacts to encrypt mail is ideal ... but difficult . 
  instant messaging is even more difficult , but there is a silver lining on the horizon !, 
  things are shifting to a more p2p style of service with things like webrtc , so give it another 6 months to a year , and you 'll have encrypted p2p messaging ( voice and video too ) . 
  i tested the one in firefox about a week ago , and while it was stable , it 's still kinda buggy , so the 6 month figure i pulled from my ass . 
  it 'll be done soon ^ tm . 
  looks like they mostly used their feet . 
  for a moment , i thought [ glukhovsky was onto something ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metro_2033_%28novel%29 ) . 
  try not to feel offended . 
  believe it or not , my intentions are good and i actually want to help you . 
  your links were reported and i approved them . 
  i 'm on your side . 
  in any case , it 's still a 3-parter because it 's about the same subject , and surely you can see why someone would think you were spamming ? 
  also , your post would have done better with one link , instead of spreading your upvotes/downvotes across 3 . 
  this is n't surprising as it happened in tuzla . 
  i 've approved your links , but in the future know that it 's very poor etiquette to submit 3 different links for a 3 part video . 
  usually you want to put links to the remainder videos in a comment in the first link . 
  oh god , i know people like this . 
  that blog as a whole is pretty interesting . 
  i ca n't help you out directly , and if someone does n't come along here to do so , you can always try / r/germany , or a dozen other german-related subreddits ( most of them linked in / r/germany , / r/de , etc. ) . 
  the city-specific / r/munich also seems to be active . 
  good luck !, 
  how exactly does this solve the `` lost generation '' 's income woes ? 
  the only thing it does is make them more employable , and there are plenty of people who are employable and some with even advanced degrees that ca n't find * any * job , let alone one related to their field . 
  as a torontonian , i think i see what you mean now . 
  it may have to do with being such a large city , having the gta be an integral part of the city itself , and being one of the most ( if not , the most ) multicultural cities in the world . 
  because of this , i think people in toronto try to be friendly as much as possible -- no other sure-fire way to get along with so many different people ( but at the same time , out of necessity also very reserved -- earning the reputation for `` coldest '' people in canada ) . 
   six billion euros has been earmarked by the european commission to target youth unemployment . 
  there is - under development - a youth guarantee scheme , where after four to six months without work there will be the promise of training or an internship . 
  i wonder how they 're going to pull something like this off . 
  training , i can believe , but guaranteeing an internship , not so much . 
  i 'd be very interested in the process that companies would have to undergo to make something like this available . 
  it just does n't seem viable to me . 
  most places will actually fill it to the brim . 
  and not sure what you mean by disingenuous canadians . 
  where in canada did you visit ? 
  while yes , current immigration policies should be questioned , this riot is really more of a class issue than it is a multicultural one . 
  yup , canadians also have randy . 
  he 's been the # 1 men 's tennis player in the world for a while now . 
   from experience , what i have learnt is that multiculturalism can not work in a society how do you explain the city of toronto ? 
  the uploader is irrelevant . 
  i 've watched videos on youtube uploaded by teenage girls , internet badasses , racists , bigots , lunatics and a whole host of other characters . 
  the video * itself * is by the nrk , and its intentions are genuine and not racist . 
  just a friendly reminder since a similar thread was posted yesterday , and had to be removed after things went way out of control : there is a zero-tolerance policy on racism . 
  by all means , immigration is a topic that * should * be discussed . 
  however , it can also be discussed in a civil manner and with some tact . 
  oh , do n't mind him . 
  many people , such as myself , prefer qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois french .

  serbia always sings in serbian . 
  i wish a little more countries in europe did the same for their own language . 
   so make sure to play up to those cultural similarities and history . 
  serbia did n't play up to cultural similarities or history with their entry in 2007 . 
  the song was about love . 
  for those that are curious , you can find the entry here and be the judge yourselves : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=706qhd-ke48 i 'd say she won because she was * extremely * passionate and the song was very melodic . 
  you 're right , my bad . 
  i was responding to the comment above and ended up using op 's language . 
  ukip to my knowledge are n't anti-immigration , but rather a much , much stricter immigration policy . 
  as for this new anti-eu party in germany , i do n't see why we should assume something is immediately shady with them . 
  an anti-eu sentiment has been rising everywhere in europe . 
  correct , mr. 
  caps . 
  i would have also accepted uvac river . 
  the real tragedy is this :  croatians point out that prosek and prosecco are different products , one sweet , the other bubbly . 
  and the croatian brand has a tradition dating back centuries , whereas prosecco is a product of the latter half of the 20th century . 
  where is the logic here ? 
  croatia should be allowed to keep its wine names . 
  for god 's sake , they were first !, 
  the fact that they would n't even be able to sell it in their own country under the traditional name feels very wrong , and bothers me a lot . 
  if this is the eu , i hope serbia never joins it . 
  very warm . 
  skip a few more countries . 
  and yes , your extremely cheap gps that dishes out directions in only `` hot '' or `` cold '' is telling you that you 're getting `` warmer '' . 
  travel west more . 
  a lot more . 
  have fun !,

  strange , i also got denmark . 
  it seems to be the catch-all nationality . 
  yes , that 's correct in the article 's flow . 
  it 's implied that up until now we have n't had anything concrete . 
  i , too , originally selected every single option for that question , only to have the survey tell me i had to pick one .

  out of the current candidates serbia and montenegro will be next for sure , in 5-6 years , maybe even albania along with them . 
  if not , then albania will be go in package with macedonia in next 10 or so years probably . 
  my condolences . 
  this is truly tragic . 
  tomislav salopek was a young , 30-year old man who was just trying to get by and provide for his family . 
  i remember one [ croatian police officer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/josip_reihl-kir ) who managed to get those logs away and who managed to keep peace in his county . 
  and that police officer complained that hdz was obstructing his peace efforts . 
  and later that police officer got killed by croatian right-wingers . 
  so do n't pretend like there were n't calls for war and terrorizing of civilian population using fear , hate , discrimination and murder in croatia . 
  and that peace efforts were n't obstructed from the very political top . 
  no need to pull out that black and white story where `` one side '' is guilty for everything and `` other side '' absolutely innocent , as nobody is buying that story anymore . 
  certainly not the official international courts . 
  furthermore it 's not the `` sides '' that are innocent or guilty , it is the individual people . 
  i am sorry you are so blinded buy the hate and that you think in collective terms when talking about people . 
  with all that said , i will not respond to your further comments as obviosuly your goal here is to start a fight using very discriminatory logic and language . 
  i wish you a nice life in the past , where you belong and where you obviosuly feel comfortable . 
  yes , that 's what i am saying . 
  he was slavic ( same as bosniaks , croats and serbs ) , his grandmother was from serbian nemanjic house , he was n't arabic or turkish or austrian or whatever , so there is no reason for croats or serbs to not respect king tvrtko . 
  but carl built obviously thought differently . 
  yeah probablly a translation mistake . 
   too bosniak coat of arms of bosnian king who was king of bosnia and parts of today serbia and croatia and was undoubtedly slavic and who 's grandmother was elisabeth from famous serbian house of nemanjic is '' too bosniak '' ? 
  i love how people who do n't know shit about the region got to determine it 's present and future ... 
   not the best meaning but one of the best looking flags for sure . 
  i think it is too complicated . 
  i love our pan-slavic colors , but two-headed eagle + cross + shield + crown ... just too much . 
  i know all those symbols have their meaning and historic and symbolic weight , but i think we should 've chosen one of the symbols and stick with just one , not put all of our symbols on the flag . 
  i prefer our civil flag over our national flag . 
  if at least it did n't have a crown ... 
  yeah i heard about that from one croatian boy . 
  we do n't have that type of city/region rivalry in serbia , so i was a bit baffled . 
  is that just football hooligans or some other stuff as well ? 
  did you have any problems ? 
   he least i can do is apologize on behalf of all sane croats why would you apologize for something you did n't do . 
  there is no point in taking the blame for the things some idiots do , just because those idiots live in the same country as we live . 
  they are idiots and that 's all there is . 
  but nice gesture , as stupid as it may sound - thanks , apology accepted . 
  the worst thing here is , that this guy , who 's car was damaged said he wo n't go to croatia again and recommended people to not go to croatia . 
  cause he had very nice time and was treated kindly and friendly in the beginning , but now has to pay around 2k euros for the damage on the car and the girls who were there got scared and traumatized . 
  it wo n't be a huge economical loss for croatia , but if young people do n't travel around , they do n't communicate and if they do n't communicate chances for peaceful and normal relations in the future are slim . 
  as people here say : `` what hundred smart men build , takes only one fool to mess up . '', 
   nobody ever said anything about innocent/civilian victims specifically . 
  actually it is explicitly stated that such a day would be a remembrance day for all victims of all nationalities . 
   an attempt to put an equality sign between everyone . 
  no , just the victims . 
   this whole thing is not going to happen and it should not happen . 
  it should happen . 
  and i am fairly certain that it will happen . 
  of course we can agree to disagree . 
   get rid of your nationalist paranoia . 
  lol ... the funniest thing is that you are not aware how obvious you are . 
   yeah ... it is n't really uncommon for serbian cars to be vandalized in croatia and croatian cars to be vandalized in serbia . 
  of course . 
  happens in both countries . 
  a lot more in croatia , but ok , you had a war on your soil merely 20 years ago . 
  i just think this is unfortunate example of what happens when there is constant talk about the war and glorification of the war . 
  these young people were born after the war , they certainly did n't hurt anyone during the war , as they did n't even exist at that time , yet they get `` operation storm '' and `` you are not welcome '' scribbled on their car . 
  they get pulled into that whirlpool of hate for no reason . 
   i have lived in croatia for a fair few years , so the languages intermix . 
  lol sure ...  big deal to you it 's not a big deal . 
  i just do n't see the reason for lying in this case . 
  but ok , do as you like . 
   in any case , placing an equality sign between a helpless victim of any of the multiple genocides in bosnia and a terrorist i think you also do n't understand and you do n't understand it on purpose . 
  the intention here is to put equality sign between innocent victims ie . 
  children , elderly and other people who did n't commit any crimes , but were the victims . 
  and there is a lot of people like that on all sides . 
  so not at all how you present it . 
  now i know there are people who think that all serbian people , including children are war criminals and that serbian children are not same as croatian children . 
  and that 's ok , you can think that . 
  just do n't expect to be taken seriously . 
   remember this ? 
  yes . 
  we can go few days back and forth just going `` remember this , remember this ? '', 
  what 's the point ? 
  i like to concentrate on the present and the future . 
  but i understand that for some people past is more comforting . 
  if angela merkel or munira subasic or \u0106amil durakovi\u0107 do n't have a problem with vucic , i do n't see why would you . 
  after all he and edi rama are the only serious politicians here , at this time , with some kind of initiative and vision for the region . 
   allies and the axis . 
  i would n't say that 's a fair parallel you are drawing there . 
  after all , there is a international court set up just for the war crimes committed in ex yu countries . 
  and there was n't a court like that in the wwii . 
  not even mention other huge differences . 
  but either way judging by you ' r comment , i 'd say you are not serious . 
  so i wo n't spend time or energy debating with you . 
  also i do n't think it is fair for you to use flair of serbia , as you are obviously not from serbia ( judging by your comments and version of serbo-croatian language that you use ) . 
  just put flair of croatia or any other country where you currently live or feel connection to . 
   it 's sole about equalization of something that should n't be equalized even in million years . 
  i think you do n't understand what he proposed and you are viewing it in rather negative light . 
  nobody said that responsibility is equal , nor is anyone asking for things to be forgotten . 
  the point here is to pay respect to the people who were killed , tortured or evicted from their home without no fault of their own . 
  that 's it , to pay respect to innocent victims of all nations and denominations . 
  of course if we are thinking in terms of `` our side , their side '' we are not going to go anywhere but in reverse . 
   that politics is continued by this `` reformed '' chetnik and is based on the sequel of the script from 1986 . 
  i do n't think you are realistic when you say that . 
  i get that you are emotional , maybe you had some bad experience from the war and i am truly sorry . 
  but i do n't think you are viewing the issue here realistically . 
   common remembrance day for all ex-yu states i do n't know , i actually think this is good idea . 
  but i think it will not pass in next 5 or 10 years . 
  first reason is whoever wants to win elections has to pander to right-wing voters . 
  the other reason is there are no serious , mature politicians in the region who are ready for humane , historical moves like that , the only motive they have is to win elections , and nothing else .

   i would first greet the independent kosovo if it 's citizens get rid of the current politicians ( a la 5 october overthrow [ 2 ] ) and if war crimes get investigated . 
  only way i will ever personally recognise kosovo 's independence , is exactly that . 
  and i think they would benefit from different politicians too . 
  yeah honestly , that 's the main reason why i want serbia in the eu . 
  i want to have the option of moving to another country without being treated worse than a refugee . 
  bosnia and albania were christian before the ottomans came . 
  i meant the `` opening of the chapters '' instead of the chapters individually . 
  because so far , joining the eu depends wholly on the kosovo talks , and it would be nice if the eu said `` recognise kosovo or no membership '' straight up , so we know if to pack our things and look elsewhere . 
  why does eu care so much about our southern province ? 
  here 's [ one ] ( http://nsp-policija.org.rs/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1701441-oro.jpg ) . 
  i saw a turbofolk girl in the bus the other day . 
  she had massive plastic lips , breasts which i felt like the biggest pervert staring at , and she was taking selfies in the bus . 
  when she turned on her front camera , i felt as if she noticed me staring at her so i moved the other way . 
  of course you should be arrested for inciting violence . 
  but i believe there 's a difference for if for an example , a brit chants against a foreign team out of either excitement or anger while living in britain , and if a foreigner does the same thing while being in britain as a guest . 
  both are wrong , but one is more mild in my eyes . 
  because it was played in serbia . 
  no , that does n't make it right but there 's a difference . 
  good . 
  and serbia will never join nato because of ' 99 . 
  i do n't know much about sudeten germans . 
  you do n't need to link me that , i live here . 
  no one is denying the massacres , but it 's completely unfair for the serbian victims to be swiped under the rug . 
  yugoslav 90s tldr : everyone enjoys shitting all over serbs , but when someone mentions the crimes committed against them , then suddenly no one gives a shit because they are the bad guys . 
  please flair up accordingly . 
  i think the reason for the lack of `` information war '' as you called it , is simply because of the reason russia believes that the chances of serbia joining nato are incredibly slim . 
  and rightly so , i do n't see it happening in a few decades , if ever . 
  after what happened in ' 99 , nato and serbia will most likely never stand in the same sentence , at least not in that way . 
  eu however , is our clear goal at the moment - but nato is very far from reality currently . 
  i guess that it also heavily depends on the actions of our government . 
  we should care , because war is unpredictable . 
  let 's say that hypothetically tomorrow uncle sam heard about the 2 for 1 meal in the burger king and looks the other way . 
  europe needs a strong military force of its own , and it should act more independently instead of being dragged into whatever foreign policy the us gets involved in . 
  usa is the biggest military power in the world , as well as the biggest spender in nato . 
  compared to the americans , european army is in shambles . 
  i guess that what i mean with this is that eu should n't rely so much on american help . 
  sure - there are benefits , but europe should look towards being more independent . 
  nato . 
  i have n't done so . 
  despite of that , us is still superior as a country ... and mostly because europe is still not one country . 
  i 'll add german and french to the list . 
  and yet it continues being carried by the us with military , the countries keep bickering one with another and ca n't solve a current pressing issue . 
  eu in its current form is quite powerless compared to some other powers out there ... maybe in a few decades we 'll get back there . 
  `` forum open '' when written does n't make a lot of sense , compared to an `` open forum '' .

  reading some of these comments and watching this video as someone living in a country which aims to join the eu , feels quite disheartening .

  that 's not really fair though . 
  tall guy having a big position is considered normal , but a short guy has the same position and suddenly he has `` something to prove '' . 
  i do n't mean your post exactly , but the whole thing in general sounds very ridiculous . 
   the issue around the balkan wars has been very much diluted here by bulgaria 's neighbours who , greece and serbia ? 
  greece pretty much does n't recognise macedonia as a state , and my country does because of yugoslavia , but you can blame tito for that . 
   the same way as serbia and macedonia did with ottoman kosovo . 
  what kind of version of history have you been learning ? 
  kosovo has been a part of serbia way before the ottomans , and before that it was often fought for between serbia and bulgaria . 
  i also do n't see what macedonians have to do with anything . 
  hope hdz does n't win . 
  can confirm , sent him a pm about a year ago still waiting to hear back . 
  do n't ignore pain but embrace it . 
  it 's quite normal for you to feel pain , but also try to realise that she was n't the one . 
  if she really was , she would n't have cheated on you . 
  if anything else , you are worth far more than she was , so do n't let it get you down . 
  time solves most things , but realise also that pain is a normal thing in these circumstances . 
  it means your heart is healing , just give it time . 
  sorry , i always forget not to throw grenades in garbage cans . 
  macedonia became a part of serbia after the second balkan war , after formerly being bulgarian . 
  well , depends on what you buy . 
  for 11 euros , i buy chicken breast , vegetables , fruit , milk/yogurt , bread , oats . 
  so i guess i was a little wrong to say daily , more like every second day or so .

  sign in subscribe france economy france on course to break eu budgetrules deficit at risk of breaching eurozone 's limit , says european commission france 's budget deficit is on course to hit 3.1 % of gdp in 2018 , according to european commission forecasts \u00a9 reuters 7 hours ago by : jim brunsden and mehreen khan france 's next president faces having to immediately implement austerity measures to avoid breaching eu budget rules , the european commission warned in its winter economic forecasts on monday . 
  in its last set of projections ahead of france ( https://www.ft.com/topics/places/france ) 's firstround presidential contest in april , brussels noted that the french budget deficit is on course to hit 3.1 per cent of gross domestic product in 2018 , just exceeding the euro area 's agreed 3 per cent limit . 
  there is also a risk that the deficit could breach the limit this year . 
  2/13/2017 france on course to break eu budget rules https://www.ft.com/content/ab4f1d98\u00adf1d4\u00ad11e6\u00ad8758\u00ad6876151821a6 2/6 public expenditure in france is set to be pushed up by measures including higher wage increases for civil servants and increased healthcare costs , the commission said . 
  french governments under former president nicolas sarkozy and successor fran\u00e7ois hollande have failed to stick to the deficit targets . 
  france , the largest economy in the eurozone after germany , last fell below the 3 per cent ceiling in 2007 . 
  in 2015 it was given extra flexibility to meet the eu 's accepted deficit ceiling by 2017 . 
  the question of whether paris should seek to stick to eu budget rules or instead fight to change them has become one of the big faultlines in the presidential race to succeed mr hollande . 
  while independent candidate emmanuel macron ( http://next.ft.com/content/a36b107a\u00addc a611e686acf253db7791c6 ) , a former economy minister , has defended the restrictions as a source of budgetary credibility , they are a b\u00eate noire for more radical candidates on the left . 
  meanwhile , the farright marine le pen ( http://next.ft.com/content/06deaa20\u00adeed8\u00ad11e6\u00ad 930f 061b01e23655 ) has vowed to rip up eu spending rules , taking france out of the eurozone and embarking on a huge spending programme . 
  the issue has fed into broader questions of how to transform the country 's economy . 
  fran\u00e7ois fillon , candidate for les r\u00e9publicains on the centreright , has made some of the boldest suggestions for spending cuts , advocating a `` thatcherite '' blitz of reforms that include $ 110bn of savings ( equivalent to 4.2 per cent of gdp ) by 2022 and a cap on unemployment benefits . 
  2/13/2017 france on course to break eu budget rules https://www.ft.com/content/ab4f1d98\u00adf1d4\u00ad11e6\u00ad8758\u00ad6876151821a6 3/6 in brussels , pierre moscovici , the eu 's economy commissioner , said the budget targets were a sign of `` political credibility '' for any new french government . 
  `` my humble recommendation to the candidates is to continue [ the current trajectory ] '' , mr moscovici , a former french finance minister , said . 
  `` the economic and political credibility of the country will be reinforced . '' the forecasts also offered some worrying reading for italy , which is in the middle of difficult negotiations with brussels over steps to reduce its mountainous debt load . 
  the commission estimates italy 's public debt increased to a record 132.8 per cent of gdp in 2016 , and will increase again in 2017 . 
  failure by rome to make enough structural effort to rein in its debt would , under eu rules , limit the scope for brussels to be flexible in how it applies budget rules to the eurozone 's third largest country . 
  mr moscovici rejected any idea that an `` ultimatum '' had been given to rome over its growing debt pile . 
  brussels has the power to impose sanctions on member states in persistent breach of its framework . 
  ft view le pen 's siren call to the 2/13/2017 france on course to break eu budget rules https://www.ft.com/content/ab4f1d98\u00adf1d4\u00ad11e6\u00ad8758\u00ad6876151821a6 4/6 the eu also raised its estimate of the uk 's economic growth , acknowledging that its early estimates after june 's brexit vote had overestimated the economic hit . 
  the commission expects growth of 1.5 per cent this year , compared with a november estimate of 1 per cent . 
  mr moscovici said brussels `` must acknowledge '' that uk growth had been `` more resilient than was anticipated '' . 
  despite the better performance , brussels ' economists warned that the effects of the uk 's vote to leave the eu would kick in during the later part of 2017 , as higher inflation pinches consumer spending . 
  in the immediate aftermath of britain 's referendum the commission forecast that a `` mild '' brexit scenario would produce a 0.9 percentage point blow to gdp , reducing growth from 1.9 per cent to 1 per cent in 2017 . 
  the latest figures show those numbers were pessimistic . 
  growth is expected to reach 1.5 per cent in 2017 . 
  despite the upgrade , the eu 's figures remain far below those of the bank of england , which expects economic expansion to come in at 2 per cent . 
  the boe has also rowed back from its initial predictions of a sharp postbrexit slowdown , revising up uk growth twice in the last three months . 
  overall , eurozone growth ( http://next.ft.com/content/0bbc026a\u00adea12\u00ad11e6\u00ad967b\u00adc884522 63daf ) would come in at 1.6 per cent this year , slightly slower than 2016 's 1.7 per cent , said the commission , as the bloc 's recovery has remained resilient to several political and security shocks .

  watch the god damn news . 
  not the fake news btw . 
  the * actual * news . 
  putin 's bitch, 
  two words : donald trump . 
  the pretext for a ~ ~ russian ~ ~ defensive invasion of poland, 
  you will create them imperialist . 
  i did that exactly . 
  be careful - they are known to multiply very quickly and might try to secede one day, 
  would be hilarious if someone cut it down, 
  alexander the great ? 
   white vote not accounted for ? 
   the middle east is a land of xenophobia and tribalism . 
  yes it is we are who the bigots . 
  the tensions do not stem from racism or anti semitism . 
  they do not stem from the fact that israelis are jewish . 
  the tensions , and all palestinian hatred for israel in particular , comes from the massive land grab and the forceful theft of palestine land . 
  israel occupies 78 % if what was once palestine , of course there is resistance . 
  israel wants the rest of the world to think that all opposition must stem from anti semitism , but the resistance in palestine has nothing to do with anti jewishness and everything to do with territorial loss . 
  nice . 
  kinda like tramp, 
  how does serb speak such good english ? 
  are you really so naiive to think that russia makes ethnically provocative trains for countries simply out of the kindness of their heart ? 
  yeah shoulda just thrown them out of the airplane . 
  the argument is not whether or not crimea will ever be reunited with ukraine but whether or not it * should * be . 
  whether or not the annexation was morally wrong in the first place . 
  your argument on both counts seems to be no . 
  i know right ? 
  israel does n't recognize independence of kosovo because the reasons that you would recognize kosovo independence mean you should also recognize palestine independence . 
  48 % of british palestine belonged to the palestinians in 1948 , now down to the 22 % and ever-shrinking with settlements . 
  population may be up but living space is ever-shrinking . 
  it 's almost as if the palestinian people in palestine are being ` concentrated ' into some sort of open-air ` camps ' . 
  hmm ... 
  as serbs we are very familiar with the meaning of ethnic cleansing . 
  / s hypocritical how the us can both support kosovo independence due to the right of all people to self determination * and * support israeli apartheid of palestine due to israeli security concerns ( or whatever ) . 
  these 2 positions are fundamentally oppositional and it 's actually the main reason israel does not recognize kosovo independence . 
  and slovenia ? 
  also regular nazi . 
   palestine is n't shown as part of israel lol . 
  i wish . 
  the israelis have a much bigger propaganda budget than the palestinians, 
  no but the human rights violations are similar enough - palestinian refugee, 
  what a waste of time, 
  are u in my psych class ? 
  finnish girls are thicc, 
  world # 1 organ traffickers . 
  this is what happens when you artificially create a country that exists only for western geo-political purposes . 
  who are they saluting to ? 
  damn austrian chicks are nice is prostitution legal there ? 
  in america the shadow government are the un-elected heads of the cia and other intelligence agency who actually run the government , prevent the president from telling us the truth about aliens , and also did 9/11 . 
  or they themselves are aliens or lizard people . 
  it has such a nefarious connotation over here , lol . 
  do n't get offended uk bitch, 
   fyi , there are a lot of unique and tasty fruits that you 've never tried that are available in russia and not the u.s.  like what ? 
  a potato is not a fruit . 
  idk maybe they were milking me for the free papayas then ? 
  perhaps this proves another russian stereotype , that they are all scammers . 
  does anyone know why ladybugs have such religious or spiritual connotations to them ? 
  fuck you nick clegg !, 
  fuck you nick clegg !, 
  you reap what you sow , western imperialists . 
  this is what happens when you invade/create a country purely for imperialistic or political desires .

   maybe this is german speaking vs. french speaking swiss citizens fight ? 
   and the driver is romansh . 
  so it 's swiss citizens fighting each other ? 
  yeah , that 's why i was suspicious . 
  comments on the article always make me rofl . 
  is croatia really dumping them at hungarian border , or this is just a rumor ? 
  self-defense . 
  migrants broke the gate and threw rocks and junk at hungarian police . 
  is that `` acceptable '' for german defense minister ? 
  what about afghanistanis ? 
  are their asylum claims justified ? 
  germany and austria are hunting down neo-nazis , so i guess that it 's justified that people hesitate to say what they mean . 
  but accepting all illegal immigrants to prove you 're not a nazi is outrageous . 
   i just signed up for another year at university and it cost me 20 $ . 
  how many people can say that ? 
  damn . 
  i pay almost 1500 eur every year . 
  on state university . 
   there was a failed asylum seeker beheaded two people in a swedesh ikea recently too ... nothing good is coming from this kind of immigration . 
  and that dude was about to get deported to italy . 
  imagine what he 'd do if he had to go to back to africa . 
  march on the highway with frau merkel 's photos . 
  slovenia is not a bad place to live . 
  but considering these guys do n't even stay in austria , i doubt they 'll seek asylum in slovenia . 
  reaction of serbian police, 
  or introduction of refugee submission quotas , so we spread them across all subreddits . 
  so it 's basically kicking the can towards slovenia , and then austria . 
  looks like that illegal immigration will never stop . 
  so they can seek asylum and get fingerprinted in croatia , and then go to germany and seek asylum again and they wo n't get deported , plus some will actually get asylum ? 
  these guys are walking over mine fields in order to get to croatia . 
  when a flood occurs , mines move and it 's impossible to tell where they are now . 
   they do n't want to come to croatia , they do n't want to come to hungary . 
  they will be able to pass through croatia . 
  so you 'll dump them to slovenia ? 
  every time i 'd sit on a park bench in budapest , beggars and weirdos start appearing out of nowhere . 
  is that a common occurrence , or they just prey on tourists ? 
  when a migrant enters serbia , he goes to pre\u0161evo police station , where he informs officers that he wants to apply for asylum . 
  asylum requests are n't processed in the place , but in asylum centers . 
  migrant gets a paper which says he wants to seek asylum , and he has 72 hours to reach asylum center . 
  with that paper , he can legally use buses and trains , at his own expense . 
  almost no one goes to asylum center , but instead they take a bus directly to border . 
  good question . 
  i have no idea . 
  maybe some government official , or police , since driving them to hungarian border is pointless and would lead to disaster , since there 's no way it can not be crossed , and all asylum requests are rejected automatically . 
   and if serbia refuses them entry ? 
  we can not refuse them due to readmission agreement with eu . 
  all immigrants that made it from serbia to croatia can be deported here . 
   our minister of the interior said croatia has a permanent border control on a higher level than the temporary ones austria and germany introduced , and that they will keep protecting our borders . 
  the migrants that show up at the border can claim asylum - if they 're syrian , they 'll get sent to zagreb ; if they 're not , back to serbia they go what if 20.000 of them break barriers and start marching on highway with merkel 's photos yelling `` germoney , germoney '' ? 
  migrants . 
  bus owners are most likely overcharging them , as they refuse to tell to tv reporters what 's the price of the ticket . 
  i wonder if croatia will fingerprint them , or just kick the can towards slovenia . 
  btw , i 'm glad that belgrade bus station park will no longer be ghettoized . 
  i 'd give food that i can not eat to my bro when parents are not looking . 
  win-win . 
  yes , they do . 
  we have refugee camps in serbia that are empty because all people are at the border . 
  but situation can escalate quickly if tens of thousands of them start arriving and outnumber police officers , like in hungary . 
  mass escape from camps , evasion of fingerprinting and march on highway towards welfare . 
   however , during the process , they are free to go around the country and might illegally leave hungary to the west . 
  how can they be stopped from leaving hungary ? 
  they 'll surely head to budapest railway station and buy a ticket to munich . 
  they 'll walk on highway and railway tracks instead . 
  or make a subreddit . 
  chaos had to stop at some point . 
  sooner they realize they can not get to germany via hungary , better for them . 
  deserters = refugees ? 
  since when ? 
  germany should give cash to hungary in order to protect schengen , not to cut their funds . 
  this is nonsense . 
  protecting borders is far cheaper than accepting migrants . 
   gyorgy bakondi , homeland security adviser to the hungarian prime minister , also confirmed that a `` transit zone '' has been set up at hungary 's border with serbia . 
  those applying for asylum in the zone will be sent back to serbia , he said . 
  the legal status of the transit zone is not the same as entering hungarian territory , bakondi explained . 
  violent riots very soon ? 
  yes , we will accept every single migrant that 's turned back . 
  `` readmission agreements with the countries of the western balkans '' http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=uriserv:l14562, 
  and another 4 million by family reunification . 
  unless they start their march towards germany on highway . 
  they are using the chance to infiltrate into europe , just like bangladeshis . 
  they will end up deported for sure , just deportation is very slow in europe , so they might leech for a few years . 
  if they get caught in hungary , it 's game over . 
  that 's why i think they will avoid it at all cost . 
  [ venspils ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ventspils ) maybe ? 
  cheap rent , not really a big town , and latvia is generally 50 % in woods , therefore a lot of intact green space . 
  there 's an aquapark , museum , library and theater . 
  2 hour drive to riga airport . 
  healthcare is a downside everywhere in eastern europe , since doctors are constantly moving to the west . 
  well , they do it legally at least . 
  they 're 100 % genuine syrians with a passport and russian visa . 
  not pakis flushing their ids and pretending to be a syrian . 
  serbia -  bosnia -  croatia -  slovenia maybe . 
  we 'll see how croatia and slovenia will react , if they 'll just forward them to austria , or register them . 
  knowing serbians , they 'll keep dumping them on hungarian border until masses of migrants spontaneously change the route and head to croatia , or bosnia -  croatia . 
  is there any info if police will use rubber bullets and tear gas if riots start ? 
  all i know is that they 'll shoot migrants from firearms if they start being stabby . 
  is gate set up at railway border crossing ? 
  last week there was an uncontrolled swarm of migrants crossing there , with cops just looking at them . 
  people should learn to encrypt their drives and use tor before they do something stupid like this . 
  nope .

serbian-born hungarian here . 
  i live in germany and i have a spanish girlfriend . 
  i never cared about nationality and i think i never will . 
   always go for the compromise except instantly after unification support the unilateral declarations of independence in the former yugoslavia ( see the `` danke deutschland '' banner in zagreb 1991 ) . 
  you may see this as right or wrong but it 's not `` treading lightly '' . 
   rue , but this happened directly after a tough foreign occupational force ( the ussr ) had fallen and pulled completely false . 
  yugoslavia was never occupied by the ussr . 
  i know !, 
  i know !, 
  you pulled it out of your ass !, 
  i am not saying it is . 
  i agree , there are countries that rely on weapons exports more . 
  quantitatively us exports the largest amounts of weapons in the world . 
  is this ok ? 
   the us already restricts exports of sensitive tech or weapons to many countries . 
  of course the us does n't export technology that can endanger it 's domination . 
  the us is the world 's largest waepons exporter considering quantity . 
  there is nothing dishonest in saying that . 
  you are banalizing my point . 
  read some of my other comments , because the only thing tiresome is answering condescending comments like these . 
   its human nature to fight over resources especially when they belong to someone else , right ? 
  your point about the sumerians is mute , everybody fought back then , yet somehow western europe has not seen war since ww2 while the middle east is a shitfest , in a lot of which western europe is participating . 
  these are failed states in the first place . 
  they were created when the colonial powers took a ruler and drew lines in the sand to split up the oil in the region . 
  they do not encompass any cultural , ethnic , ideological or any other entity . 
  they can only be kept together by authoritarian regimes for this reason . 
  authoritarian regimes were supported or opposed by the west for the sole purpose of maintaining a steady supply of oil . 
  democratic governemnts were often directly toppled . 
  the current political situation in the region is not entirely , but to a large degree the responsibility of the us , uk , france , etc. 
  i highly doubt the us , the worlds biggest weapons exporter would ever propose or cooperate on such a thing . 
  ah , yes , they are savages by nature . 
  maybe if the us was n't encouraging saddam to attack iran he would 've stayed away from kuwait too . 
  `` big powers '' is not just nato . 
  so ... this approach is working , right ? 
  or are you suggesting a permanent occupation of the middle east ? 
  bombing libya not much , the rest - a lot . 
  no , not a plot ( far from the west remaining neutral ) , but invading iraq , arming the former ba'athists , bombing libya , etc. 
  very clearly was . 
  well it 's an approach we did n't try in a few centuries ... 
  not really . 
  it is illegal under international law to supply weapons to militant groups that are not official forces of un-recognized states . 
  iraq should not have been invaded in the first place . 
  no , but if `` the big powers '' stopped fucking around the middle east and africa , that would go a long way . 
  well , that is of course reducing my argument to the absurd . 
  it is not that simple , however as the west jumped to support the rebels against assad , a lot of the weapons supplied to them , as well as a lot of what was supplied to the new iraqi army ended up in isis ' hands . 
  now in syria we have a `` a la yugoslavia '' clusterfuck with uncountable militias in which everyone has a favourite , and nobody can quite gain a complete victory . 
  all this is a result of geopolitical battles for a dwindling resource and its distirbution . 
  let 's not act surprised there is a humanitarian disaster in the middle east . 
  ps : i do n't think you quite understand what `` wishful thinking '' means . 
  unless you are implying i want germany 's meager support for the kurds to be the reason of the war , or whatever ... 
  at no point did i claim that . 
  what is wishful thinking ? 
   are you a nazi croat ? 
  well , he obviously is . 
  nikoli\u0107 is a buffoon . 
  but he is right on one thing ... 
  i saw a man in germany holding up a sign `` when you export weapons and support wars - you should n't be surprised by war refugees '' . 
  hey , the guy was from vojvodina . 
  do n't mess with that . 
  balkans war 3 : macedonia reconsidered . 
  note to self : invade slovakia . 
  you mean south serbia , right ?

  well , we have n't been to war in 16 years !, 
  what kind of a hippie commune of a country are we running here bre ?!, 
  generations are growing up without ever hearing artillery fire , if we do n't do something they will all grow up to be gays . 
  time to piss off the west !, 
  the thing is - i did n't . 
  one line closed so the clerk sent us to the neighbouring one , i was waiting for 10 mins when they arrived , and i made it first to the line ( by going a bit faster ) . 
  and i explained later . 
  tourists ( like me ) from hungary in greece standing behind me complaining that we cut the line ( i was with some serbian people , talking in serbian ) . 
  at one point i just turned around ( after good 5 mins ) and explained in fluent hungarian that they are wrong . 
  the looks on their faces ... 
  but ukraine is not in the nato . 
  that makes things quite a bit more complicated for nato to get involved . 
  at this point nato could make `` united against the weak '' it 's official motto . 
  well , maybe , but it 's one of the first things i noticed too . 
  even the smallest german villages have really nice sidewalks . 
  huge contrast to serbia where you can step in the mud if you turn at a corner from knez mihailova .

  oh , you found a book !,

  um , what about kosovo ? 
  oh lol , forgot about dialects, 
  we conjugate verbs, 
  7 cases , congruention , declination and conjugation , sound change , cyrillic alphabet, 
  well , imo ( serbian speaker ) west slavic languages are easiest to learn . 
  i would start with polish , then after learning it it would go like cake for every other slavic language , except from eastern ones ( russian , belorussian and ukrainian ) . 
  i would ( and i am doing ) learn polish , russian and serbo/croatian , and you are covered for whole slavic world ( with little vocabulary change when you are moving between countries ), 
  for a serb you show a disturbing lack of ` kosovo is serbia ', 
  atleast one of slavic languages , and spanish ( 2nd most spoken language in the world ), 
  better than sending bombs and depleted uranium, 
  they have regiment of 540 bears that guard border,

  number of young people in that column should be low . 
  you 're basically angry at all the old people who grew up in soviet union and were indoctrinated into stalin cult as children . 
  convert kebab navy force, 
  all is serbia,

  you guys atleast have navy, 
   who would be an on a uss balkan ? 
  nobody , we would kill each other in war to secure the driving wheel, 
  how to deny your own problems : 1 ) blame russia 2 ) ?? 
  in serbia it would n't ever happen . 
  but this would be too abusable given sudden influx of asylum seekers and migrants, 
  that yugoslavia/serbia duo tho, 
  it 's grave digger toma , not thirsty slobodan, 
   ajdinator he just became saudi whore, 
  so bicycle is literally driving wheel ? 
  german can be interesting at the times, 
  seeing that i ca n't read german and form my own opinion over that article , i am gon na back out of this argument and edit my second comment, 
  it could be ~ ~ probably ~ ~ clickbait and over-dramatisation in addition to ignorance as you said . 
  internet newspapers/tabloids are cancer of this society, 
  we had current president going on hunger strike sometime in past . 
  that is some kind of armored vehicle , definitely not a tank, 
   serbia has already mobilised its army we have army ? 
  current ( and past ) government did all to kill military, 
  you forgot to mention ~ ~ mordor ~ ~ balkans, 
  that 's called gu\u010da, 
  it 's like shitty , non musical , political version of exit, 
   but its just hype and drama . 
  that in additions to click baits and boobs is what drives today 's media and newspaper, 
  could you wait atleast few days when reposting ? 
  every person in luxembourg , ( 6 , to be precise ) attended wedding . 
  sorry for my most extreme ignorance , but how much % of country is that park ? 
  is there any tree planted in vatican ? 
  even water is immigrating, 
  i like it how while every other slavic country has some svet/swiat variation , russians be like ** mir **, 
  you never pointed anything about recognisement apart from asking what countries recognise prd and prl except russia , matter that i am not too familiar with so google or other redditors are much better alternatives to ask, 
  they both seceded from their countries , using armed conflicts and mother countries does n't recognize their independence . 
  exactly the same situation, 
  that story was mumbo jumbo by some old `` prophet '' family , he took it seriously, 
  we have former grave digger with bought university diploma who speaks english on illegal-chinese-immigrant-in-us level as our president . 
  beat that neighbours, 
  try to find some ukrainian text or news article , as it 's most similar to russian , see what words you can recognise , put article in translator and remember differences between languages . 
  wait so you dont know how to pronounce polish doted or marked words ? 
  i thought poles got that from you , germanic neighbours, 
  our politicians signed a some kind of alliance agreement with nato that lead to protests in which about 15k people participates . 
  ` live and let live ' ` forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors ' not that i am missionary ( i find christianity moronic ) but that is written in the bible, 
  in russian you could recognise some words , and have little trouble learning language , but it 's much closer to ukrainian and belarusian ( being part of east-slavic ) polish , along with other west-slavic languages ( czech , slovakian ) are little harder to understand ( i assume it 's cause germanic influences ) but with little bit of learning it could be understandable now i 'm not sure this analogy is correct but learning russian as serbian speaker is like italian learning latin , it 's so similar, 
  cause our governments change when the wild blows , and they like to change political courses from pro-eu , to pro-russia , and in recent time pro-us, 
   since the middle ages interesting , do you have some article or historical study that elaborates this more deeply ? 
  it 's bit hard to explain to not-slavic person this , but serbs/croats/bulgarians can perfectly understand macedonian , it being a south-slavic language very similar to above 3 . 
  also happy cakeday, 
   understand it both in speech and in writing this is also case with almost all slavic countries ( not knowing for slovenia ) in balkan . 
  jebem ti majku is universal insult that you can use all over former yugoslavia, 
  um we both are orthodox christian , slavic , have similar cultures and traditions , have even same pagan gods , lots of same names , similar language , hate usa , wear tracksuits , squat , drink too much alcohol , shitty roads etc. 
  revive tito as zombie and we will , there can be no yugoslavian without yugoslavia and no yugoslavia without tito, 
  macedonian is funny to speak as serbian , cause other people will understand and think that you are idiot for not following grammar changes in words , reading is same . 
  bulgarian is n't too different than serbian , but it is a different language, 
  some parts of bosnia do , others do not, 
   what situation ? 
  situation about having country as your adversary in court, 
  serbian and croatian are n't same languages , serbo-croatian was conglomeration , having words from both languages just to appease to masses and bring idea of ` yugoslavian ' nation closer, 
  dude i wrote that in like 7 seconds , english is my 3rd language and gf was screaming at me , i worded it bit wrong . 
  it 's uprising funded and helped by russia , started by russian minority ( majority , idk ) and they seceded from ukraine . 
  now it has same situation ( problem ) as kosovo , being recognised by some and not by others, 
  you were christian under castriot family right ? 
  the skenderbeg/skonderbeg ? 
  well most of population became muslim after turkish rule , and that eased things, 
   taking albanian childreen with them as a threatto a clan/family and rule over them etc we also had that in serbia , in bosnia too  they caused many albanians to leave during those centuries we like had 4-5 mass migrations to north just to avoid turk rule  did n't allow opening schools we neither , feels bad man, 
  you guys have 2nd most favorable occupation , just under bosnia 's . 
  being muslim also helped . 
  how from serbian language neighbouring countries teach and speak serbian with tiny changes and just plainly rename it . 
  `` bosniak '' , `` macedonian '' , `` montenegrin '' , `` bosnian '' my ass . 
   what will most likely not change , and what will change , from the common eu citizen 's pov ? 
  serbia will not enter eu 99.999 %, 
  i think if somebody from germany said : southern part of georgian ( which is 2000km away ) capital is ours , we built it , hitler would rise from the grave and said : hans i am so proud of you , that is reicht . 
  turkey ? 
  i can understand serbian part but why turkey ?

  i think he meant bosnia and ottomans specifically . 
  that 's so odd ... 
  i know that the second way is considered more feminine , but i pretty much cross my legs that way most of the time and i 'm straight . 
  got to get cancer first !!!, 
  cigarettes !!, 
  they are like 2euros per pack , so better pack up !!, 
  i do n't understand the whole `` armed conflict '' merkel mentioned happening in case of germany closings borders . 
  who is going to get into the conflict ? 
  croatia and serbia ? 
  i doubt anyone is going to war over refugees , especially considering how tired people are after the last recent war . 
  what 's with this line of thought that the balkans is this war-torn place where people ca n't wait to jump at each other 's throats - a place where the sun does n't shine ? 
  you are taking life too seriously . 
  that 's hilarious . 
  it 's really not that much ... a native speaker knows about 20k . 
  i 'd say that you 'd need to know around 5k words and more to achieve fluency , but the way duolingo teaches you words is n't as effective as some other methods . 
  that 's a big if though . 
  i guess the same logic could be applied to german learning dutch or the other way around , though what about a german learning scandinavian languages ? 
  how similar are they ? 
  not even close ... closest duolingo gets you to is around a1-a2 level . 
  it does n't teaches you how to speak , it makes you type ridiculous sentences , and it teaches you only about 2k words . 
   is it because they were more likely to be conscious of their diet ? 
  i think it might be this . 
  meat eaters can indulge in more unhealthy fast food . 
  people who drank fish urine . 
  should n't it be in french ? 
  i wo n't edit it , let the whole subreddit know my shame . 
  let 's move to france and hope / u/dclauzel will buy us baguettes and beer . 
  yup . 
  he 's clearly addicted to it when he wrote just a second later that he could n't imagine his life without porn . 
  i think people underestimate how addicting porn can get . 
  i 've read some replies in this thread that some people are unable to masturbate without porn , and i do n't think that 's normal . 
  there 's nothing wrong with masturbating , but i think that too much porn can really affect you . 
  does n't matter , still in the balkans !!!, 
  everyone is a family in the balkans . 
  greece !!!!, 
  always greece . 
  also really love romania !, 
  bulgaria and macedonia get one kiss each too !, 
  gypsies . 
  are uk 's women really that bad ? 
  can confirm , looked at myself in the mirror . 
  france , italy , spain ... and if i went for another slavic country , i 'd pick either poland or czech . 
  well if it 's just the pinkie , then that 's not gay . 
  afaik germany abolished tuition fees, 
  can confirm , sounds like my uncle . 
  i thought romania had loads of it people coming to work there every year ? 
  source ? 
  okay fine , but none of that funny ottoman stuff !!, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/craiova_group give it time , we 'll get there . 
  oh great , everyone is turning miserable just as we are about to open the negotiation chapters !, 
  i think not . 
  depends what you consider under relevant , and even with that it does n't change the fact that eu = / = europe . 
  the way she combines english with french makes you really realise how ugly english is compared to french ... 
  probably not , but europe is a continent , eu is an organisation . 
  in eu , not in europe . 
  holidays mostly ... 
  i rarely if ever go to church and pray before eating , but i 'll go if my family wants me to . 
  although russia 's economy got worse because of the sanctions , russia 's military is strong as ever . 
  if putin wanted it , he could conquer all of ukraine in just a few hours instead of saying he 's innocent and that they are simply rebels in the territory . 
  ukraine is n't a part of nato , so nothing is stopping russia from taking it . 
  if you liked dexter , you should check out hannibal . 
  i have n't seen it but i heard that it 's really good , especially if you are learning spanish since apparently , it has many spanish-speaking parts . 
  wtf slovenia , what happened to your inner yugo sports genes ? 
  oh no you did n't go there ... 
  he asked for the explanation of the video , and why it 's relevant today . 
  fuck sake , do i have to add `` oh by the way we did bad stuff too '' on each comment i write ? 
  albanians are angry at serbs , so they are destroying their thousand years old heritage , churches and monasteries in kosovo . 
  edit : typo at s, 
   looking at this video is getting me the idea of that the ottoman empire was a better solution no , no , no ... 
   funny how you draw the line precisely when it suits you . 
  i was n't the one who brought up pre-yugoslav era . 
  i was n't the one who mentioned ww2 . 
   what happened in the '90s however had nothing to do with ww2 . 
  although true , some of it is easily traced back to ww2 and the crimes against serbs from the side of nazi croatia . 
  or will you write that those genocidal crimes are justified ? 
  what i mean to say is that because of the actions from the ww2 , there was still bad blood between the people living in yugoslavia , which only helped fuel the war between the countries . 
   the war was started by a serbian nationalists who assassinated the next leader of another country . 
  archduke 's assassination was just an excuse . 
  war was going to start one way or another , and one man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter . 
  pre-ww1 is irrelevant in modern age . 
  i 'd also say that ww2 is irrelevant as well . 
  but if we are going with ww1 , serbs have suffered more than any other country in the world during that war . 
   to be honest when the serbs did this they engage in mass rape , mass murder and ethnic cleansing so large that europe has n't seen its like since ww2 . 
  who are they to complain ? 
  yeah , and albanians on kosovo are so incredibly innocent , they definitely did n't get involved in any sort of war crimes . 
  or hold on a second , a war criminal is leading the `` country '' even now !, 
  we have every right to complain , considering kosovo has been a part of our state for over a thousands of years , and both culturally and historically often considered one of the most important parts . 
  but i guess you are not interested in learning any sort of history pre-ottoman invasions . 
   if the serbs want sympathy then they need to acknowledge their monstrous guilty . 
  we did so , and we 've delivered all war criminals to trial . 
  what more do you want from us ? 
  to recognise kosovo ? 
  that 's not happening as long as the same war criminals from the 90s are in kosovo 's parliament . 
   allowed the bosniaks to come back home . 
  serbia does n't recognises kosovo 's independence . 
  it 's not , and even if it was it would n't be able to be compared to kosovo . 
  savages . 
  thankfully not all albanians are like that . 
  yup , i remember reading a post here about i believe maybe ukrainians going to sweden to work , and after years spent there they still ca n't get swedish citizenship easily and stay there . 
  everyone knows american haarp is killing our crops .

  i remember that , and also that lichtenstein was suing slovakia because the commies nationalized some lichtensteinian property 60 years ago and they do n't want to return it . 
  all these hostilities will have to be resolved before lichtenstein is allowed in . 
  i suggested to a japanese colleague of mine that japan should join and adopt the euro , but he just smiled and said no :(, 
   also switzerland , norway and iceland can join anytime . 
  iceland ca n't join . 
  the eu is not a charity and we should n't accept bankrupt countries . 
  i do n't think they use european power outlets . 
  it ca n't happen till they change to our superior technology . 
  what about those turks that listen to black metal and drink beer/raki ? 
  no , turks are far more industrious . 
  i could imagine living in turkey because everything just works there , while in greece i had trouble getting from one village to another because there 's just one taxi covering the whole area ( ie . 
  people do n't see a business oportunity even when it 's so obvious ) . 
  they also differ in mentality . 
  greeks are just greeks , ~ ~ everyone ~ ~ every guy has a beard , has an orthodox cross , complains about not having a job . 
  turks in izmir are very atheist , in kayseri they 're very religious , in trabzon they 're almost eastern european , in alanya they 're like italians ... 
  it will make more sense after the cloning vats are built . 
  i agree . 
  they should get the same status as norway or switzerland . 
  turkey gets economic benefits , eu gets nice beaches and does n't have to border iraq and syria . 
  what about lichtenstein ? 
  for too long have they been a torn in both austria 's and switzerland 's eyes . 
   we have one of the lowest ( if not the lowest ) eu fund absorption rates i 've heard romania takes so little money that this year it will become a net contributor to the eu budget ( just like sweden , denmark etc. ), 
  what germany really is saying they do n't want another sweden in the eu  ), 
  for a quick read , select a language and then click on its `` executive summary '' . 
  there 's also a [ comparison of languages ] ( http://www.meta-net.eu/whitepapers/key-results-and-cross-language-comparison ) page . 
  i never understood the russia thing . 
  all the other countries in europe fight bloody wars over some cities or tiny territories , while russia wins/loses a billion km ^ 2 in each war . 
  how is that even possible ? 
  conspiracy !, 
  quite creepy . 
  he literally stepped on the toes of the most powerful people in the country , and now they 're out to get him . 
  it was a `` czech problem '' but [ 8 people were poisoned in slovakia ] ( http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2012-09/17/c_131853967.htm ) and a few more in poland and hungary . 
  countries are not isolated from each other ... 
  that 's the thing with german highways that they do n't want you to know about  yes , there 's no speed limit , and yes , you do n't have to pay tolls or vignette , but if you look at how the 4 of us paid maybe 12 euros for toilet fees just to cross germany , it would actually be cheaper to buy a vignette and get free toilets  in hungary and slovenia you have to have a vignette , but the toilets are free . 
  yeah of course , there always has to be a minimum level of services that every person should have , in order to not violate their human rights . 
  i see now that we 're only disagreeing on where that level is . 
  i think people should be fed , clothed , educated and given basic healthcare , for free if they ca n't afford any of those things , while you would in addition want to give them some pocket money to buy a tv . 
  also , i would n't want them to be fed with quality food , or to wear quality clothes , i 'd want people to have to work for such things . 
  if they are disabled or elderly , then as i said before , it 's a different category , then they should get higher quality services because they ca n't help themselves . 
  uhhh i 'm not denying that croatia was the weaker side at the beginning of this conflict . 
  i do n't think anyone will deny this . 
  but you still had more than a few broken ak-47 and civilian trucks . 
  this is just the first link i found on google , you can probably find more if searching in local language : http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1743360/posts  october 4 , 1991 : a convoy of three truckloads of anti-tank weapons and 40,000 military uniforms arrived in the croatian capital , zagreb  late october 1991 : four mobile workshops , six 155mm howitzers , and a number of 120mm mortars , along with70 us-made general dynamics stinger advanced , manportable surface-to-air missiles ( sams ) , reached the port of zadar , from german sources . 
  and this is what your own minister said : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7fd-3jxteu&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=1097s also , it 's not fair to overestimate the strength of the serb army . 
  the jna was falling apart with everyone deserting it , and anti-war protesters , hungarians , yugoslavs , were forcibly conscripted and sent to vukovar . 
  you can guess how high their morale was . 
  this is why the paramilitaries were sent in eventually , since they did want to fight . 
   no , you do pay more , if you earn more . 
  10 % of 10 is 1 whereas 10 % of 20 is 2 . 
  you just have the same tax rate . 
  well yeah , i meant the rate . 
  if i pay 40 % while the other guy pays 10 % , then it 's not fair . 
   they might buy a big tv no , they ca n't buy a big tv , they 're poor . 
  if they could afford a big tv ( over 500 eur ? ), 
  then they would be middle class . 
  well i have n't been to the uk but they also want money in slovenia , thailand ... maybe other places that i ca n't remember now . 
  you 're missing the point here . 
  i 'm not saying the croats fired the first shot ( i believe they did but that 's not relevant ) , i 'm saying the croats were armed with more than just ak-47 as you claimed several posts above . 
   * barely * managed to get few ak-47 's lol , you should stop the self-pity ( which you earlier attributed to serbs ) , it 's similarly annoying . 
  what i hated the most was paying for toilet at gas stations on the highway , even if we purchased fuel . 
  each time it cost like 50 cents . 
  we were going from the netherlands to slovenia and we stopped every 2 hours , so it cost something like 6x0 ,5 = 3 euros per person !!, 
  you need to buy something first and the code to enter the toilet is printed on the bill and you can use it only once !!, 
  will this nuclear program also allow it to create nuclear weapons ? 
  i like this quote from the comments section :  can someone please explain to me how anyone can establish a company trading in food products with no checks , monitoring etc and then just disappear when the crap hits the fan . 
  no business registration documentation , no health and hygiene inspections , no details on the property lease agreement , no police records of vehicles registered to the company , what about info from insurance companies -- do n't tell me , they were not insured . 
  sorry i just do n't understand how this can happen . 
  something needs to be done , quickly , these cowboys could be the cause of a huge body count through their criminal actions and the chances are it will be the very young and very old who would die first . 
  first the poisonous alcohol and now this . 
  i think slovakia has some serious health safety problems . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  those 12 policemen were sent to borovo ** after ** the incident i linked to . 
  if you do n't understand what i 'm talking about , go to 19:07 , i 'm talking about this moment . 
  let me write it out in chronological order : 1 . 
  serbs in borovo are afraid the croats will `` kill them all '' so they set up barricades 2 . 
  croats fire rockets at those barricades 3 . 
  serbs invite volunteers to protect them from croats 4 . 
  croats send armed policemen to borovo 5 . 
  serbs kill armed policemen point # 2 is when a weapon was first shot in the war , it was 3 rockets fired by the croats . 
  what you quoted was point # 4 , it happenned only later . 
  and rockets ! = ak-47 . 
  where did those rockets come from if the croats were unarmed ? 
  according to you the croats were defending themselves , so why did they fire the first shot ? 
  here , from the article you linked yourself :  in an effort to defuse the situation , the area 's moderate police chief , josip reihl-kir , agreed that the croatian police would not try to enter serb villages without the explicit permission of the local serb authorities ; in return , the serbs agreed to dismantle barricades . 
  [ 9 ] [ 10 ] however , as he later complained , his efforts were seriously undermined by the actions of croatian nationalists who stoked the tension . 
  one particularly notorious incident occurred at borovo selo in ** april 1991 ** . 
  several members of croatia 's ruling hdz party , possibly including gojko \u0160u\u0161ak , who later became croatia 's defence minister , fired three armbrust anti-tank rockets into the village . 
  the attack caused no casualties , but became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in relations between the two republics . 
  [ here 's the poor croats defending themselves with broken ak-47s :\\ ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=4nfmiczasac#t=1104s ) . 
  please watch for at least 1 minute to get the whole story . 
  this was before the fighting began , in fact this is the first time that a weapon was used . 
  watch for 5 minutes to see the first moments of the war in croatia ... 
  i 'm talking about personal experience , of course i 'm maybe wrong . 
  i can speak serbian and slovenian , and have been to the czech republic ~ 5 times and also talked with czechs and slovaks in many different occasions . 
  slovaks also live in serbia and a friend of mine told me a few things . 
  so whenever people ask me where i 'm from , i say serbia since this is true , and i really do n't like explaining history . 
  in perhaps 70 % situation i got a friendly response ( the other 30 % were neutral ) , and by this i mean they told me `` hello my slavic brother '' , `` kosovo is serbia '' and `` hooray we 're all slavs here '' . 
  of course , in these situations i did n't want to confuse them and explain myself . 
  my family name sounds slavic so i can give that if they ask my name . 
  once while hitchhiking i had a really ridiculous situation with a slovak truck driver telling me how it would be great if serbs and slovaks bordered each other , and it 's too bad there are those pesky hungarians in between .

  maybe limit the tickets so they can only be used outside rush hours ? 
  the price is in the article , have you even read it ? 
  $ 150 euros from zagreb to paris is anything but dirt cheap . 
  and in any case , that is an added cost to the cost of the trip - you still need to pay for food and accomodation . 
  heck , $ 150 is already a third of the price of the interrail ticket - and that 's just one trip !, 
   if you have a genuine need it wo n't be an issue . 
  how do you prove you have a genuine need ? 
  who gets to decide ? 
  how do you prove the need is legitimate and who gets to decide ? 
  that is a good question . 
  regarding other costs , train prices are an issue , and accomodation is not necessarily ( camping , hostels , couchsurfing ... ) . 
  when you 're 18 you do n't really care too much about comfort . 
  due to gas prices road trips get quite expensive , especially compared to free trains . 
  you 'd have one year to use it , for example . 
  nobody for sure would expect you to go to the trip * immediately * . 
   i know for a fact that canada does the same , and i presume the european non-eu countries have some similar regulations . 
  eu countries have the same regulations towards non-eu nationals . 
  you would n't have to use the ticket immediately . 
  i pay almost exclusively by card and euro is still a convenience , as i do n't have to deal with exchange rates , bank provisions and all kinds of different just-in-case cash . 
  what 's that ? 
  bad , but not as bad as the uk . 
  most of the media are in one way or another controlled by the government , with the clear relation between tabloidness and the level of government control . 
  there are a couple notable exceptions , and those who really want to get informed , still can . 
  visas are not a problem . 
  even know , holders of irish visa that are normally not allowed in the uk are still not allowed in the uk . 
  sure , they can cross into it , but are then there illegally and suffer the consequences if caught . 
  where is the democracy in the decision based on lies ? 
  you are aware that with guilder there would also be inflation ? 
  secondly , you should really choose better where you drink your tea . 
  that is not even legal to do . 
  largely it was proven that the sudden price increases were a myth . 
  it is n't that much hassle because you pay your bank to fix it for you . 
   get a credit card with no foreign transaction fee like a normal person . 
  not everyone can get this . 
  dutch banks for example will not hesitate to reject a credit card application . 
  the brits also have no respect for spanish culture . 
  not all immigrants harass the local population , only a small minority . 
  only the money argument stands . 
   do n't think he actually did that from pvv election program : `` all mosques and islam schools closed , ban of quran . '', 
  will also apparently save some money . 
   if you come to a country and your culture is not compatible with the culture of your host country , you are welcome in my book as long as you adjust yourself correctly . 
  if you do n't then you are not welcome in my opinion . 
  this is how i feel about it . 
  how about all those brits living on the spanish coasts , infamous for only hanging out with other brits and not speaking a word of spanish despite living there for years ? 
  no , but there are many calls to kick them out , heck , in the nl itself wilders calls for institutional discrimination of muslims in the hope that will make them leave . 
  obviously , we are in the different times than the 1930s , but even nazis first tried to simply relocate the jews , and to make them leave ( by institutionally discriminating them ) , and only when all the other attempts did n't work they went for the final solution . 
   its not like hitler 2 is going to appear and take over again , calm down actually , the rhetoric is surprisingly similar in many areas . 
  what 's ... what 's wrong with you ? 
  he is right , though . 
  i deplore putin , but the fact is that generally any restrictions on trade affect the economy . 
  polish apple farmers managed to find another source of income , kudos to them , but there are many people who struggle . 
  with this said , sanctions are justified and should remain . 
  the problem is that sanctions are not due to mh-17 , but due to crimea annexation , and my question remains - what more are dutch politicians supposed to do ? 
  what are they supposed to do about it under the current circumstances ? 
  start the war with russia ? 
  get nato to declare war on russia ? 
  russia is already sanctioned , despite the fact that european economy suffers for it . 
   funny that , as i 'd still say `` nationalism and tribalism '' are , and have been , quite a bit higher in , oh i do n't know , serbia . 
  they most definitely are , but you are attacking a strawman . 
  this discussion is not about serbia , which is also not in the eu , and rightfully so . 
  it just happens to be where i was born . 
   and using the hdi as your indicator would also show that , among others , the saudis and israelis have better countries than you or much of europe , yet i imagine you 'd rather disagree with that assessment . 
  israel is a better place to live in than serbia for sure . 
  saudi is one of the extreme exceptions where hdi does n't give a full picture , i agree . 
   no , you just refused to accept that the us is better , saying instead that you ca n't agree with that because it 's a `` mixed bag '' , thereby implying that europe is both better and less of a mixed bag . 
  it is both better ( hdi list also says so ) and a mixed bag . 
  it was not my intention to imply otherwise . 
  i do think that , due to it 's specifics , there are many people who find life in europe better for all kinds of reasons , which is why i called it a `` mixed bag '' . 
   so germany acting in narrow national interests and forcing southern europe to accept monetary policies that have been demonstrably horrible for them is all well and good demonstably ? 
  i am not in this camp and am not convinced . 
  pigs economies were doing bad before the euro as well , just had a different set of problems . 
  their economies have structural underlying problems that monetary policy alone ca n't fix . 
  i do think that germany and other better-off countries should invest in poorer ones , kickstarting the economy and pushing the employment . 
  if the market is ever to be truly united , the money should be pooled together . 
  like in the us . 
   or the eu as a bloc consistently flaunting wto rules and discriminating against other nations why does n't it suffer any penalties from the wto then ? 
   or a `` one line for us , another for you '' immigration policy i do n't understand this . 
   or creating additional armies it makes sense not to depend on the us and the uk for defence . 
   but if the uk wants to control her own lawmaking and her own borders , then it 's tribalist , nationalist , and archaic . 
  it is . 
  in the globalised world , no nation is truly sovereign , and the more you want to trade with the outside world , the more you have to adapt your own rules as well to facilitate that trade . 
  north korea gets to set all their own rules , it 's going great for them . 
  re : canada , let 's agree to disagree . 
  some of your remarks are quite subjective , some are wrong ( both trump and trudeau have bachelor 's degrees ) , but as i 've never visited canada nor lived there , i do n't feel qualified to talk much about it . 
  i know a lot of people who really enjoy living there , and they are doing great on all the metrics . 
  also , i was n't the one who first mentioned it . 
  i am not saying that the eu is great , i am saying that , compared to the rest of the world , it is generally a very good place to be , as a evidented by the fact that we have to build fences to prevent people from getting in ( as do the us and australia as well ) . 
  also , as we all know very well on this sub , most of the people trying to get in are not from war zones . 
  mexico , costa rica , south africa , lebanon are all doing worse on hdi list than bulgaria , which is doing the worst in the eu . 
  although personally i hold lebanon in high regard , considering how many refugees they welcomed without throwing a hissy fit about it . 
   as is europe . 
  it definitely is , i 've never said otherwise . 
  i would even say the us is generally doing better than europe as it reaps all the benefits of actually being united . 
  so louisiana is doing better than bulgaria ( an honest comparison , worst to worst ) . 
   yeah , no . 
  huge swathes of europe have worse state support than does the us . 
  i will need some numbers for this . 
   as evidenced by the fact you think canada is awesome . 
  why is it not ? 
   why is it that vastly greater numbers of people leave europe for america when america is so much worse ?

  uh , absolutely none of things ppl mentioned exist here . 
  though it would be good to have some restrictions ( at least annoying kids would be moved out from clubs ), 
  most of them are quite ok ( except 2nd and maybe 5th ) , first , fourth and those about singing i would implement in srb as well . 
  here gypsies can sing ( mostly literaly screaming ) and play all sorts of nonsence in downtown without any consequences . 
  3rd is quite hilarious . 
  [ she ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jelena_karleu%c5%a1a ) . 
  i ca n't really tell why is she really disdained . 
  i was a kid when she was rising star so i do n't remember too much details , but she was always extrevagant and her outfits were somewhat strange . 
  she was also notorious for being really direct about competition and other singers . 
  i used to hate her like pretty much everybody i knew earlier , but when i listened to some of her texts i found them quite interesting and rather smartful . 
  i think if she was born somewhere on the west she would be an absolute star . 
  though , she still has number of fans here . 
  me too , i always wait on red with the car but rarely with bike . 
  video games , movies , tons of series , reddit , studies in gr and countless articles about my studies on english . 
  [ this one ] ( https://youtu.be/o9qra0hdf9e ) would be an actual version of anthem, 
  [ \u266b \u2669 \u266b ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocw3fbqpqku ) fun fact : not too many people have heard for this song ( much to the surprise of internet community , i guess ), 
  gibanica as dessert ??????????? 
  for public ( buses in towns ) it 's usually on monthly tickets . 
  usually in towns who are student centers . 
  you can also get discount for inter town relations ( actually i used that one almost exclusively ) for both return and monthly tickets , i think 33 on montly and 40 on return tickets from original price . 
  mostly on bus tickets . 
  serbia most certainly not . 
  at least my faculty . 
  though relation between assistants and students is usually more relaxed , as they are closer to us in age . 
  sometimes in belgrade police can actually fine you ( if you are that uncareful not to notice an officer on the other side of the street , since it 's easiest way for them to fine somebody ) , but generaly it is acceptable . 
  in my town is totaly ok to do it . 
  also , from my experience living in greece , it 's also ok . 
  unfortunately , no . 
  second tier is quite weak , major teams are playing in some sort of yugoslav league in order to have more stronger games so they can be concurent in euro competitions . 
  first tier is played from best teams in second tier plus major teams , usually in spring . 
  that 's how you get a state champion . 
  on the other hand , every competetion national team is playing is covered . 
  pools ca n't accomodate more than few hundred spectators . 
  but , when national team plays , especially outside of belgrade , people are even standing in order to watch . 
  [ do n't underestimate toma ] ( https://youtu.be/8ibeohlaiia ), 
  water polo . 
  not as popular as a foreigner might guess ( judging by success in that sport ) but still a lot of children train it , especially in places which have pools and some swimming/water polo clubs . 
  i think you are mistaken . 
  eu was never really popular in srb ( polls were showing over 50 percent sometimes , especially before 2008 ) but nowdays moderate people see turmoil in eu and are becoming more and more against asscesion , of course , politicians need to adapt to new way of thinking in order to stay in office so they too go over joining eu . 
  extreme nationalists/leftists were always against it , though it is the case throughout e europe and s europe . 
  populist politicians trying to exploit people 's dismain over eu , economic progress , surge of migrants while exploiting nationalistic , religious and many other kinds of stereotypes . 
  is it just me or your names and surnames sound a bit like greek ones ? 
  we have different experiences then . 
  though people who hanged around you were hanging 1 ) to practise their english 2 ) because they are keen to hang out with foreigners . 
  but they are tiny minority . 
  except you ca n't run into youngsters everywhere , especially if you go to some civil service , or even a bakery or supermarket . 
  also , 2/3 of youngsters on balkans ca n't put more than 2-3 sentences in proper english . 
  [ times are changing ] ( https://youtu.be/dnlbgffbpoa ), 
  little russians wink wink, 
  only in the early 90s , after surge of nationalism and abolition of bans for return of kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 royal family . 
  today it is mostly seen as marginal issue . 
  rover 25 1.4 , i got it from a mother and i like it very much . 
  once i saw an austrialian in a train heading from belgrade to romania . 
  it was quite interesting situation , i was one of few youngsters in train and i chatted with him , while rest where seniors who were smiling ( perhaps is more precise laughing ) at odd - looking westerner with dreads and massive backpack . 
  that is n't really a flaw , from an american point of view . 
  when i was in us , americans thought it 's really cool to know other language and to speak in some fancy , totally , new way than anything they ever heard . 
  economy was living on foreign aid and imf loans , freedom was such that if you sing nationalist song or speak about ruling party you end up in jail . 
  nah , if you have to drink to tolerate turbofolk then you are n't from balkans . 
  since when are you in balkans ? 
  except for new year . 
  you can not kill kebab retroactively, 
   we were killing  slovenia ?? 
  oriental melodies are basics for much of pop - folk music in all balkan countries as they are catchy and easy to dance with . 
  there is certainly something with mentality about that . 
  they are n't that popular as they used to be though ( now they are mixed with techno and rap ) . 
  haha , exactly . 
  apsolutely never . 
  here in serbia , police units are divided by municipalities , for example , belgrade has 17 police prefectures because it has 17 municipalities , alternatively , most towns ( usually a town is a municipality , belgrade and larger cities have several municipalities ) have 1-2 police stations ( depending on size ) and a outpost in almost every village which is part of that specific municipality . 
  all together they compose a prefecture for that one town . 
  a policeman is required to go through 1-year training , after which they usually get a job in their local prefecture . 
  yet , since police is seen as job for mostly low - educated , poor and as a last result ( because you will get a job after training for sure ) a lot of people come from rural and poor areas and finish up serving in belgrade , causing some to travel more than 100 km to their working place , daily . 
  but most policemen work in their own towns and it is encouraged to have contact with local communities , going that far that a policeman patrols their own part of town . 
  although i have prejudices , i think they mostly are . 
  i had good encounters when they were helpful and bad encounters , when i know that i was n't right , but overall , i think they are doing their job fine . 
  do n't care . 
  i do n't have problem with police overusing their force against people who deserve it . 
  you have to attend 40 classes of theoretical lessons , where you learn about rules and signs . 
  you are usually given a book or pdfs which consist of about 2500 questions . 
  it is a boring and some questions are quite hard to memorise ( some just needed to be memorised by heart , like length of bus needed to have lights on top ) yet nessecary part . 
  test is done on a computer and there is 41 question , you got to have above 85 percent to pass , i had 93 . 
  once you pass that , you have to take a first aid training , organized by the school , consisting of a day of lectures with an theoretical exam plus showing how to provide aid to injured passanger . 
  it is more informative than stressful and i found it a rather cool experience . 
  then , you have to go to the doctor for your eyes and mental condition to be checked . 
  it is a formality and it is charged . 
  organized by the school . 
  at the end comes 40 hours of driving , mostly in town , with a lecture in out-town driving and usually 1-2 lectures in night driving . 
  you are given an instructor to work specifically with you . 
  first you usually go to a range where you practise basic driving straight and turning . 
  later in the training you will return to range to practise parking , driving uphill using handbrake , driving backwards while changing lanes , speeding up to 30kph and semicircular turn on a road . 
  you usually start in lower density streets and gradually move to downtown . 
  in test , your instructor , plus two people from police make up the commission , you pick the paper with a number of the route , then , your instructor explains you the route ( if you are going to school in your town it 's quite easy to catch quickly streets ) . 
  basically you drive to the range , do all things you learned there and return to the driving school , for every single mistake a point is deducted from a 100 , you have to be above 85 to pass . 
  i did n't found it hard , yet it was boring sometimes . 
  i pass all of these things straight away ( some ppl are stuck at practical part for years ) , yet i had luck with timing and route of practical exam , it was low density of traffic . 
  it costed me totally 600 euros ( 450 for both parts of training + 60 euros for first aid + 2x40 euros for both exams ) . 
  suddenly experts for ice skating , lacrosse and field polo emerge / s. 
  ( you do n't see those people around on sports tv stations except once in 4 years ) , but basically it comes down to male/female volleyball , male/female basketball and water polo . 
  and if we do n't win medal from some of the things mentioned ( especially for water polo ) it is a national disaster . 
  maybe you should ask how other people live in hungarian dominated areas , serbs ca n't use their language as hungarians usually ignore when somebody askes them in some other language ( although hungarians know it , of course ) , i know for that as i heard a lot of examples , from shops , train stations etc. 
  do church leaders have leverage on daily politics , meaning , are they in touch with politicians ?

  because arab christians can more easily live with other christians and adopt to the christian culture that europe is based on ( christmas , easter etc ) .

  he tries too hard to be funny and then he really isnt, 
  not a fan of islam . 
  its beliefs do not fit into the liberal society that is europe in terms of how women dress and sharia law . 
  it just plainly does n't . 
  the muhammad drawings in denmark in 2004 , and the recent charlie hebdo ** drawings fucking drawings people ** convinced me of that as well as this .

  opinion on europe and sharia law . 
  should it , if it could , be implemented and should muslim communities in europe or germany let 's say , have the right to adopt sharia law ? 
  what ? 
  ohhh i see, 
  i think it 's just dumb because the serbian hungarian border is n't that large and if they block it off the migrants will just go around through croatia via bosnia or romania which have much larger borders with hungary which are absolutely unprotected . 
  i think they it it with the 74 constitution and they were refered to as `` muslims by nationality '' . 
  that is why their religion is mentioned in this article . 
  okayyy fine dont listen to logic then, 
  dnno ? 
  well not really  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ten-day_war, 
  great , this guy . 
  the anti-serb northern irelanderrrr protestant or catholic or whatever, 
  because croatians are croatians serbs are serbs but bosniaks arent really a nationality officially . 
  to call them bosnians is wrong too because anyone who lives in bosnia is a bosnian realy . 
  bosnian muslims dont have an established nationality like serbians , croatians or hungarians for example . 
  their religion is their nationality in a sense . 
  i thought slovenia was the country that went to war and macedonia was the one that avoided it ? 
  doesnt bother me just waste of $ $ $ i think really,

   i 'm not a separatist , but i do n't feel serbia is my homeland . 
  i do n't feel i 'm not part of serbia , i just do n't feel it 's my homeland , i. e. i do n't have a connection to serbia but i have connection to vojvodina , though . 
  i do n't feel like i 'm part of any nationality , because i was never raised as a part of one community . 
  neither were my parents . 
  my maternal grandparents were serbian and rusyn , paternal were german and grandmother , who was hungarian and german .

  [ this ] ( http://wiwibloggs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/conchita-wurst-sausage0.jpeg ) is clearly european , for instance . 
  for me , something european is something that is clearly from europe and is meant for europe , and above all , it has an obvious european mark or quality ( like the conchita wurst shown above :d ) - sure , you can sell it in namibia and east timor but it loses its point . 
  this , on the other hand , is europe - * based * ; if it had an obvious european quality it would be european for me . 
  i mean it 's european , but so is [ lada ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/lada_niva_1991_brazil.jpg ) and so is erste bank , so i made the distinction between european and europe - * based *,

  on the other hand , documentaries are usually dubbed . 
   there 's not exactly anything to dub other than anime . 
  you never watch foreign content ( except anime ) ? 
  to be honest , i had no idea that dubbing is so common in the rest of europe . 
  in serbia we never dub anything .

  vu\u010di\u0107 has a mouth full of kosovo . 
  your stance on this is way too simple . 
  trust me . 
   basically a mafia state that 's true . 
   it looks like serbian have a part of their land kidnapped by albanian mafia it 's our fault . 
   if albanian in kosovo did n't want to be in serbia , they should have gone to albania instead of declare independence . 
  also our fault . 
  if we treated them properly , they would n't have a reason to declare independence . 
  and if you do n't agree with a country 's policies , you should n't move out , you should change them . 
  but if you 're treated like junk and penniless and illiterate , you ca n't do much . 
  i am generally against all these independences , but kosovo has been repressed by us in the past , so i have to say i 'm fine with it , as long as it does n't create a nationalist paradise . 
  i 'm generally against these independences because i believe countries should n't be based on nation or religion like many today are . 
  us definitely * is * a very important ally , however , a natural ally does not spy on its natural allies .

  hahahaha on what planet is britain , remind me again ? 
  gib ~ ~ monies ~ ~ pathetic subsidies plox, 
   my proposed treatment of the russian is not so much fueled by dislike of said russian , but more by the survival of the european . 
   if i could move russians to a different geographical location where they could continue to exist in whichever way they desired , i 'd much prefer that and hope for them all the happiness in the world , but alas it is not possible , hence the annihilation . 
  that 's very ... european ?

   okay you 're becoming quite nationalistic that 's a low punch , especially since i have n't said anything offensive about serbs . 
  i have my reasons why i care . 
  what is sns if it 's not an anti-eu party ? 
  or did you actually believe them when they said they changed ? 
   ) ) also , you should pay more attention to what kacin says , since it 's his job to tell you when you fuck up . 
  the other eu ministers that come and go can tell you nice things because they do n't bear responsibility , while kacin would probably lose his job if serbia became completely hostile to the eu . 
  one prison costs 500 million euros ? 
  do they make the bars from gold ? 
  i think you 're overestimating it by at least one zero , if not more . 
  ask the eu for help . 
  like i mentioned in a previous post , they donate around 1,4 billion euros , spend that 0,4 billions on prisons . 
  or sell telekom and instead of wasting the money on pensions and government salaries , spend it on prisons . 
  there is money to be found if you really want it . 
  i believe the new belgrade bridge cost some 400 million , right ? 
  that 's like 8 prisons !, 
  what do you mean he does n't have an education because his parents were n't wealthy ? 
  is n't education free in portugal ? 
  there 's a muslim minister of culture ? 
  is this like a muslim shadow government ? 
  the government . 
  do i have to draw this for you ? 
   the benefits of a pride parade are negligible in the following weeks you will get the reaction of the eu , and then tell me if it 's negligible . 
  here 's the first reaction : http://www.slobodnaevropa.org/content/kacin-srbija-ce-dobiti-sta-je-trazila/24728140.html you are aware that the eu is giving millions of euros as donation to serbia ? 
  for example , between 2000-2006 they gave 1,39 billion eur and between 2007-2013 they predict 1,4 billion . 
  that 's money you never have to give back , unlike the money you get from russia . 
  that same money is also more than the costs of this parade . 
  links below . 
  http://www.emins.org/sr/aktivnosti/projekti/apsorpcioni-kapaciteti/100917_policy_paper.pdf ( page 7 ) http://serbianna.com/news/archives/3296 so you just keep on fucking with the eu and voting for anti-eu parties and then wonder why is your country going bankrupt . 
  you will have to turn to your old pals cuba , north korea and china for help ( unfortunately iraq and lybia are not available anymore ) , just like during milosevic , and i hope you 're old enough to remember how `` useful '' their help was . 
  i see , more prisons should be built , regardless of this gay pride issue . 
  when is the minister of interior going to start ? 
  there is no logic in it , because the government should show its power through the existing mechanisms of opression . 
  meaning , everyone that protests violently gets immediately arrested and the courts sentence them to a few decades in prison ( as an example ) . 
  what 's happening here is that the people in power do n't care about gay rights , so they make up dumb excuses . 
  and you 're agreeing with them . 
  because you have two groups , one is preaching love and tolerance , the other is a bunch of evil thugs that want to hurt or kill innocent people , and you need to pick which side you 're on . 
  your tax money would be put to good use . 
  it 's actually surprising to see how suddenly money is so important , why was there never such great concern about the money that gets lost in the many corrupt government agencies ? 
  i think you 're just looking for an excuse , because you know yourself that this is the wrong thing that happenned . 
  uhhh , you missed that whole us embassy burning thing from two weeks ago ? 
  according to your or metaleks ' comments they caused damage of hundreds of millions in 2010 . 
  so the cost of keeping them in prison is less than having them outside . 
  btw . 
  i was reading an article how the fascist obraz movement finally got banned . 
  that 's a good move , now they just need to ban the 1389 , nasi and dveri , and should they appear on the protest , bang , another 10 years on top of the 20 . 
  i know a lot of housewives speak spanish because of the spanish soap operas , 
  syria is already supplying the pkk with weapons , just look up how many pkk attacks there have been recently in turkey . 
  this belongs to / r/europe how ? 
  while i understand what you 're saying , you do n't want to propose a solution because you think there is no solution . 
  the march should be allowed . 
  the hooligans should be arrested ** and sentenced to 20 years in prison ** . 
  then next year there will be less people that want to beat up gay people . 
  unfortunately this will not happen because , as you said it , 80 % of serbia does n't like gay people . 
  the right thing to do in this situation is to just ** come out clean , bring a law that says homosexuality is illegal in serbia ** , and everyone will understood what 's going on . 
  especially now that your president says that serbia wo n't hurry into the eu , there 's really no reason why you could n't do this . 
  russia will probably even applaud the decision . 
   if no one cared , why would they continue to pursue it ? 
  etc etc. 
  look , the fact is , kosovo gained independence in 1999 , and gained legality for its independence after the icj decision . 
  case closed . 
  i know you could probably talk forever about this , bring up various links which would , in your opinion , prove that you 're right , but it wo n't change the fact on the ground that kosovo is independent and recognized as such by the international community . 
  since it 's independent , it has the right to decide whether it wants to give some territory to serbia or not . 
  so far the kosovo government does n't want this . 
   i 'm passionate about the land , and its people -- more specifically , the serbs but kosovo is 90 % albanian , so you ca n't say you 're passionate about kosovo . 
  maybe about northern kosovo ? 
  and let 's be more specific about this , how is it that you express this passion ? 
  for example , i 'm passionate about cooking , so i spend a significant amount of my monthly income on various spices and foodstuffs , i spend a lot of time learning about how to make food ... how much % of your monthly income do you give to kosovo serbs ? 
  do you spend your time on issues related to kosovo , for example by learning albanian so you could understand the other side ? 
  or do you just like to talk how you 're passionate and argue with strangers on the internet about it ? 
   there is now , more than ever , a growing sentiment that is anti-eu in serbia . 
  [ oh no , whatever will the world do now ... zzz ] ( http://www.blic.rs/strip/1284/marko-somborac )  and i , and a lot of other people are just fine with that . 
  a lot of people are n't , that 's why we left that hellhole of a country . 
  kosovo is just a story your elite uses to manipulate the masses while they fill their pockets . 
  it 's not even such a good story , you need to be especially blinded to not see it [ \\ ( another relevant cartoon \\ ) ] ( http://www.blic.rs/strip/1496/marko-somborac ) . 
   milosevic has been dead for almost a decade when kosovo decided to split . 
  that 's not a valid reason anymore . 
  kosovo became independent in 1999 , they probably forgot to notify you . 
  this is the de-facto case on the ground ever since . 
  all that followed afterwards was a silly game of paperwork , bureocracy and shit no one in the world cared about . 
  and eventually that game ended , again , with serbia 's defeat , when the icj declared that kosovo 's declaration of independence was indeed legal . 
  btw . 
  serbs are not a homogenous entity , just because you 're passionate about kosovo ( the territory , not its people ) does n't mean everyone else is . 
  as the '99 war has shown , serbs would rather have peace than die for kosovo . 
  as the elections in 2008 have shown , serbs would rather have a normal life than risk isolation from the international community because of kosovo . 
  i do n't know what makes you think that `` every man in serbia would rise up '' if kosovo joined albania . 
  based on past experiences , in my opinion , if such a thing happens , the only consequence would be some street riots in belgrade , perhaps an embassy or two would be burned , that 's it . 
  in eastern europe there are `` almost '' no black people , there are more asians though ( chinese , vietnamese ) and i like to think they are tolerated . 
  of course there are random graffiti against them but i do n't think i 've ever seen people shouting at asians ( or perhaps i subconsciously forgot about such cases ) . 
  the hungarian word for a black person is `` n\u00e9ger '' , which is not at all a racist word , unlike in english . 
  i 'm guessing it has n't become a racist word because there never were enough people to be offended by it . 
  on the other hand my wife was waiting for the bus just the other week and some black french guy ( he had a french accent ) asked some kids for directions and they started offending him like `` go back to africa '' etc. 
  which is really embarassing . 
  i like to think that the huge majority of people are n't racist though , at least i never think in racial terms . 
  who 's ron swanson ? 
  no i wo n't search the internet , i 'll allow the information to come to me b ), 
  not really , kosovo gained the right to independence because of the cruel way the serbs treated its inhabitants . 
  the kosovo serbs are not being murdered by the kosovo government , so they do n't get to separate . 
  separate the north region , and let it reunite back with the country it belongs with . 
  the majority of kosovo does n't want that , so no . 
  what about the stars ?

   moldovan 75.8 % majority . 
   ukrainian 8.4 % , russian 5.9 % , gagauz 4.4 % , romanian 2.2 % , bulgarian 1.9 % , other 1 % , unspecified 0.4 % minorities . 
  for programmers , it 's easy . 
  bad programmers can be spotted relatively quickly . 
  well , it 's kinda hard to work `` towards further integration between the countries '' when you were in a war not long ago where you were disintegrating from each other . 
  but i understand what you want to say . 
  in time ... 
  my guesstimate is 50 years . 
  until the generations , who were babies during the wars , do n't start dying . 
  that fact gives me hope for the balkans . 
  if you guys managed to start doing your business peacefully , sure we will manage to have such relations . 
  your language is truly diverse . 
  turks [ want to invade ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/41ifrf/what_if_the_largest_countries_had_the_biggest/cz2tpai ) again . 
  probably will need to form centraloslavia . 
  maybe later . 
   netherlands , sweden niiice ...  bulgaria , albania , croatia , montenegro you blew it op . 
  both latin and cyrillic scripts were derived from the greek alphabet . 
  that 's actually a good thing . 
  because we serbs know both cyrillic and latin , i kinda can read it without much trouble . 
  names ending with slav ( glory ) and ljub ( to love , kiss ) are slavic in nature and they are common in serbia . 
  it really is funny to think of an atheist called bogoljub ( the one who loves god ) . 
  do n't assume that . 
  he may also be croato-serbian . 
  may you live 1000 years . 
  germany : [ ~ 5 million ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_casualties#holocaust_deaths ) . 
  belgium : [ one million to fifteen million ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leopold_ii_of_belgium#exploitation.2c_atrocities.2c_and_death_toll ) . 
  serbia : [ 8 thousands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnian_genocide ) and [ 25 thousands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_albanians_in_the_balkan_wars ) . 
  croatia : [ 320 thousands to 340 thousands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_persecution_of_serbs ) . 
  bulgaria : [ 2 thousands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surdulica_massacre ) . 
  ** note ** that these numbers are probably ** quite off the mark ** because it 's hard to calculate all the loses . 
  what is certain is that western europe is better in genocides . 
  and in everything else . 
  by issuing fines . 
  nothing scares a serb more than a promaja and a fine . 
  excellent . 
  in serbian spokoj / \u0441\u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0458 means serenity . 
  there is also a word pokojnik / \u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0458\u043d\u0438\u043a which is used to mark someone who died . 
  peace is mir / \u043c\u0438\u0440 . 
  simillarities between slavic languages are quite interesting . 
  ah , glorious serbo-croato-bosnio-montenegrian language . 
  and a hell of a lot harder to acquire . 
  yugoslavia is a flat circle . 
  was there even a doubt ? 
  please , do yourself a favor [ and read this wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnia_and_herzegovina#demographics ) first . 
  not everyone in bosnia is bosnian . 
  a third of population of bosnia are serbs . 
   how can kosova be serbian while we were all under ottoman rule . 
  because serbian built their cities and monasteries there . 
  also , it was under serbian governance always except during the ottoman occupation . 
   you mean like b92.com or some other serbian propaganda website ? 
  nope . 
  i mean wikipedia . 
   also on 2 july , 114 ethnic albanian delegates of the 180-member kosovo assembly declared kosovo an independent republic within yugoslavia . 
  [ 90 ] [ 88 ] on 5 july the serbian assembly dissolved the kosovo assembly . 
  [ 90 ] [ 88 ] serbia also dissolved the provincial executive council and assumed full and direct control of the province . 
  [ 93 ] serbia took over management of kosovo 's principal albanian-language media , halting albanian-language broadcasts . 
  [ 93 ] of course it was dissassembled when you decided to unilaterally declare independence inside another country . 
  you were directly violating the constitution of the country you lived in . 
  what was supposed to happen ? 
  just allow you to brake off like that ? 
   it 's not about syntax nor grammar . 
  it 's about arrogance . 
  you had the nerve to insult my english and then repeatedly misspell the word `` hypothetical '' . 
  there 's a famous english saying for what you 've done : no , it 's about the meaning , as i 've already said . 
  you intentionally take my words out of context to serve your illusion better . 
  i 've first assumed you made an error while reading but i see now that you intentionally do that . 
   do you really think the eu or us gives a fuck about igniting a conflict between us ? 
  if us means kosovo and serbia , then yes . 
  eu wants stability in this region and us wants kosovo as it is today because they have a military base there . 
   we 're a member of nato and a lot closer to eu than you guys so i do n't think either of them will be defending you . 
  what does that have to have with kosovo ? 
  also , why would they defend us and from who ? 
  who 's closer to the eu is debatable , i will leave that to the future . 
  eu and us wo n't allow the alliance betwen kosovo and albania except when the two countries joint the eu . 
  but when that happens , we all will be in the eu and we will all be a big happy family . 
  serbia has had control of kosova for a grand total of 3 centuries since dardania was first mentioned by king bardylis in 4th century bce . 
  much more that the albanians . 
  any source that says something you do n't like is biased . 
  nope . 
  i accept wikipedia as the valid source . 
  english is not your strong suit . 
  again ? 
  dude , give it a rest . 
  you tried taking my words out of context and you were being willfully ignorant . 
  the downfall of yugoslavia was serbian arrogance and i 'm glad to see it 's still alive and well . 
  blaming one nation for the downfall of yugoslavia is ridiculous . 
  it 's not that simple . 
  the downfall of yugoslavia was largely the result of corrupt politicians without a vision and the collapsing economy that followed . 
  instead of making people cooperate and live together , side by side and improve economy , politicians from every nation in yugoslavia decided to grab more power , more money to themselves and make people hate each other . 
  hell , politicians in the croatia and kosovo today still win elections based on the amount of hatred expressed towards serbs during the election period . 
  but that wo n't last for long . 
  hatred does n't feed hungry mouths . 
   if you did you would know this was the real albanian state declared in 1912 : you are aware that the kosovo was the part of serbia since the late 12th century ? 
   http://www.refworld.org/docid/469f38f51e.html here is what it says :  [ after the constitutional changes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_kosovo#the_1990s ) , the parliaments of all yugoslavian republics and provinces , which until then had mps only from the communist party of yugoslavia , were dissolved and multi-party elections were held for them . 
  kosovo albanians ** refused to participate in the elections and held their own ** , unsanctioned elections instead . 
  as election laws required turnout higher than 50 % , the parliament of kosovo could not be established . 
  find a better source . 
   again i just want to reiterate that it 's no surprise a union consisting of 5-6 countries all backed by the soviet union those countries were also backed by the us . 
   followed by this trying to correct me for correcting you : it 's not about the syntax but about the meaning of the words . 
  you are unable to understand my words or you are not willing to understand me because you know that you are wrong and you need to take the words out of the context ( probably later because of the following ) .

  cause we drownin ' in that pussy * airhorns * and also so we can beat croatia at something else than basketball, 
  i was recently watching a championship so must of mixed them up lol !, 
  nonetheless , the czechs are supperb at javelin throwing . 
  maybe they saw the 10 hour version of 2017 epic sax guy and decided they need n't be in moldova no longer . 
  they had seen all of it ... 
  high-power laser ? 
  more like death-ray !, 
  rue de belgrade sounds dope . 
  just sayin ' . 
  - jan vesely ( javelin throwing world record holder , legend ) - staropramen and all of the beers - karlove vari ( spa ? ), 
  - weed is legal in prague ( ? ), 
  - if slovaks were austrian basically, 
  yes , the tech ones are the best because they have to be , because tesla and shit . 
  my sister goes to mechanical engineering and is pretty happy with everything ... 
  i touched on education quality briefly but for me ( i study philology ( languages and culture and stuff ) ) it 's subpar . 
  teachers are uninspiring , follow a boring step by step programme ( some even just read the textbook for 90min ) . 
  electives are pointless and soul crushing and there either are n't any extra-curriculars or if there are , they suck ... 
  `` better '' . 
  you clearly have n't visited a branch of belgrade university lately . 
  it 's all buildings from the yugo era . 
  nothing renovated , and the style of teaching is horrible . 
  but if you manage to survive these , i guess you 'd have a better chance of getting a job in germany or wherever . 
  honestly the austria thing for us is not far off . 
  i was in vienna and whenever i tried to talk to anyone for directions in english or german they spoke back in serbian . 
  i was like what weird part of belgrade did i wander into . 
  but yeah , a lot of people are in germoney ( i know at least 5 ) , also switzerland and sweden . 
  there 's quite a few serbs in \u041c\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0438\u0458\u0430 . 
  and chicago is basically mini serbia ( 400k serbs from what i know ), 
  the croatia part is false i believe , unless novi sad has been overrun by them . 
  the montenegro part is true and annoying . 
  go back to podgorica with your weird accents and stop taking our spots in universities , you voted leave live with it !, 
  excuses will get you nowhere . 
  you 're all welcome to stay . 
  but you 're gon na need to learn serbian . 
  i know that 's gon na be hard but you must try . 
  excuses will get you nowhere .

  balkans do n't drink much wine casually , at least not in serbia . 
  we drink beer casually , and if we 're going for it , it 's rakija , vodka or vinjak ( serbian cognac ), 
  ffs . 
  ottomans bad austria-hungary not as bad, 
  we just took the mama rusija 's flag and flipped it upside down , it 's not the same thing . 
  yours is the same as the dutch one . 
  you are more wrong than we are !, 
  hey the dutch called , they want their flag back . 
  they said you can keep the pinapple tho . 
  i never said women should n't be free . 
  is n't taking care of yourself the most freeing thing ? 
  maybe people should be less reckless with their sexuality and pay more attention to what they do instead of having 30 late-term abortions and all the morning after pills for fun ... good on poland , hopefully polish people will take care of themselves . 
  you forgot to mention the montenegrin kite . 
  downvote !, 
  balkans can into vegan ??? 
  this map seems off , we eat all the meats ... 
  we learn serbian for 12 years in primary and secondary schools , and we learn english for 12 years as well , plus 4 years of an additional language from grades 5-8 ( mostly german russian and french ) . 
  so we are being forced as well basically . 
  and somehow all of us speak serbian , most of us speak english , and a lot of us speak one of the third language . 
  `` rebelling '' against your native language your forefathers fought for the right to speak is stupidity at it 's finest . 
  and it 's lazy as hell . 
  so i 'm trying to learn irish gaelic and stumbled upon this video of a government meeting where the main speaker was laughed at for refusing to speak english and speaking irish instead . 
  the comment section was brutally against him as well . 
  is this a common thing in ireland ? 
  people not wanting or knowing irish ? 
  i do n't want political comments on this one , just more of cultural/language ones , please .

  not very icey have fish on all coinage and are passionate about it fabulous horses which they banish if the horses ever leave iceland issolated which can be good and bad,

  no more . 
  is the studio audience laughing ? 
  this sub has mostly turned into a eu fanwank ... it 's sad depressing and annoying . 
  i sympathiyse ( whatever it 's spelled ) with you . 
  and frankly i do n't care if you voted leave remain or if you abstained . 
  `` weird shit sorry '' yeah , pretty much ... 
  the georgian flag uses the st. george cross , same as england , with those plusses in boxes , so there 's a connection there ... 
  ok , i understand strongly disagreeing with someone 's political affiliations or whatever . 
  but , booing and hissing at someone ? 
  that 's straight up childish and dissrespectful ... 
  regardless of if this was a result of brexit , congrats to poland and good luck . 
  hoping for many more investors all over eastern europe ( we might even get paid what we deserve one day ), 
  i was in corfu last summer and had a really interesting conversation with a greek restaurant owner . 
  a bit about the country which will not be named made me lol . 
  anyway , love y' all !, 
  yeah that 's why you 're making graphs and pie charts and i 'm getting laid, 
  trying to bang this communist chick ... soooo, 
  idk just far enough till we all fall of the edge of this fuckin ' flat disc .

no , he said he would go before anything in un was even being mentioned . 
  but then swiss authorities arrested naser oric , a bosnian muslim accused for war crimes and other criminal activities after the war . 
  both serbia and bosnia have cases against oric , but bosnian muslim president calls him a hero . 
  then bosnian muslim president of bosnia said that serbian pm is not welcome . 
  then swiss authorities extradited oric to bosnia , so bosnian muslim president said that serbian pm is again welcome to come . 
  and after all that this thing in un happened ... so it 's not that simple . 
  it 's never simple here . 
  alright , i am a dick and you are sincere . 
  i am sorry , i misunderstood you . 
  sincerely . 
  the issues are very complex and i am too tiered . 
  the fact is that being in a war and being exposed to propaganda 24/7 can mess you with your perception . 
  some things take time . 
  all sides in the region are working towards peace and normal relations and they are normal or almost normal for quite some time actually . 
  but what certainly wo n't bring peace and reconciliation to the region and what pisses me and probably most of the serbs off is generalization , collectivization of guilt and one-sided approach to victims and criminals . 
  that 's it , in short and without going into particulars . 
  i agree with you mostly . 
  i am not justifying anything . 
  all i am saying that victims on all sides should be treated with respect and not used for political reasons and criminals on all sides should be brought before the law . 
  you have a problem with that , not me . 
  it goes both ways . 
  i accept that karadzic and mladic are war criminals , just like oric . 
  you have a problem with it . 
  what ? 
  i am not denying anything ... 
  how people become so cynical like you ? 
  i do n't understand what are you trying to say . 
  when have i threatened to anyone , i do ' t understand ? 
  lol man you are seriously reaching and grasping for straws now . 
  first of all we started talking about present time , you said : `` there are many , many polls showing high levels of support . '', 
  that 's present tense , right ? 
  then you give me poll from 1995 . 
  are we talking about present time or what ? 
  and let 's take a look of that pool showing high support for milosevic in the year 1995 : `` the poll interviewed a sample of 2,000 people and its results are ' ** relatively reliable ** , ' suggested dragomir pantic , director of the social science institute of ** state-controlled belgrade university ** . '', 
  so director of a state controlled institute says that dictator of that state has the highest support among people in the war-time year of 1995 ? 
  yeah , i 'd trust him . 
  you do n't realize that milosevic and his regime controlled everything in serbia during the '90s , media , schools , police , you name it . 
  so this source is highly unreliable . 
  that ** one ** unreliable source does n't make anything `` clear '' as you stated . 
  and this goes to all those `` sources '' that you listed . 
  outdated and unreliable . 
  when you want to have serious discussion you can find me . 
  otherwise just arguing for arguing sake and being exposed to other peoples uninformed and cauvinistic views is not my thing , but thanks for trying . 
   was what happened at jasenovac genocide ? 
  no , the tragic truth is that what happened in jasenovac was n't officially declared as genocide . 
  do n't you see that as a problem ? 
  is n't that a bit fucked up ? 
  between 80 000 and 100 000 jews , serbs and roma killed in one camp along with thousands of others in other camps including women , children and elderly and it is n't officially declared a genocide . 
  and that 's what bothers most of the serbs . 
  so serbs from bosnia invaded bosnia ? 
  mladic , karadzic and oric are all monsters . 
  the difference here is that you call one of those monesters a hero , while i call them all monsters . 
   there are many , many polls showing high levels of support . 
  source please . 
  just saying `` many '' two times does n't make it more believable without sources . 
   it is clear that there has been widespread support for milosevic , mladic just saying something is `` clear '' does n't make it more believable without sources . 
  first define `` many '' . 
  secondly prove it buy reliable source , then we can talk . 
  also there are muslims that see naser oric as a hero or croats viewing ante pavelic as a hero ... so ? 
  that still does n't mean shit . 
  making general statement about one ethnicity based on what ** some ** people of particular ethnicity are doing or saying is just plain fucking wrong . 
  the important things is what governments and elected officials are doing at present time , not what kids write on the walls . 
   does labeling something a genocide make it worse than mass murder ? 
  i do n't care how it is called , i do care that he tried to defend it buy saying ndh killed only `` the enemies of the system '' . 
  like that makes it less horrible somehow . 
  that poll is from 2011 . 
  and here is a comment from head of cesid ( the organization that conducted the poll ) , commenting on the poeple who voted mladic as a hero : '' * but mr lucic says that experience shows that these people might be upset `` for a very short period : a day . '' * nice job omitting that quote . 
  maybe last elections held in serbia would be better indicator of general sentiment of serbian people , where the only party with radical views got 2.1 % of votes . 
  but eh who cares , let 's use selective source from 4 years ago , pull things out of the context and make conclusions . 
  anyway comparing wwii nazis and hitler with serbs and ratko mladic ( he is still on trial and officially not guilty of anything btw , not defending him , just saying . ), 
  is insulting to everyone . 
   they 're clearly supporting a war criminal . 
  they are minority and they have a freedom to wear and say whatever they like , unless it is call for violence . 
  there are people supporting all kinds of persons and ideologies all over the world . 
  what can you do ? 
  but explain please if serbs were killed only as enemies of the system , [ how were serbian children enemies of the system ? ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sisak_children's_concentration_camp ) . 
  and how that is n't a genocide and systematic killing ? 
   i hope you guys will join eu eventually . 
  how things are looking right now , i hope eu will still exist by the time we are ready to join . 
  yeah but in ndh serbs , jews and roma were treated equally horrible . 
  i can remove all quotes about jews from my above post and statements made buy ndh officials and it would still be obvious that there was systematic extermination of serbs conducted in ndh . 
  what 's tia ? 
  yours was hypothetical , mine was factual . 
  and mine had a point , what was the point of your comparison ? 
  that display of nazi symbols are banned in germany unless used in art and german state defines what 's art ? 
  we all know that , thanks . 
   is n't the same as wearing a t-shirt with someone 's face on , which is a clear act of approval . 
  some people aprove it , it still does n't prove shit . 
  there are neo-nazi and all kinds of radical organizations all around the world , with all kinds of hateful ideologies and it still does n't prove shit in regards to that particular nation , country , ethnicity , what have you . 
  yes , jews . 
  nazis killed jews all over europe , including croatia . 
  you did n't know that or what ? 
  yeah it 's good and it was really needed here . 
  they also said they will take care if something is considered `` street art '' , they will try to not remove it , but if it is something that instigates hate , they will remove it . 
  pretty awesome and pretty unexpected from our government . 
  :d the biggest problem here are stray dogs though . 
  : s we still do n't have proper services who take care of that ... 
   because those were selective killings of the system enemies ah sure and `` system enemies '' were jews and serbs , not selective at all ... * `` we will kill one third of all serbs . 
  we will deport another third , and the rest of them will be forced to convert to catholicism . 
  '' * * `` this country can only be a croatian country , and there is no method we would hesitate to use in order to make it truly croatian and cleanse it of serbs ... '' * '' * croatian people must be more alert than any other ethnic group to protect their racial purity ... we need to keep our blood clean of the jews '' * '' * judaism as one of the greatest enemies of the people '' .

come back pls, 
  i do n't think it 's a slave mentality , it 's pragmatic mentality . 
  not sure about translylvania , but some of the infrastructure in vojvodina was better developed in austrian times than now . 
  there are irrigation systems and channels that were used then , but are now in disrepair . 
  even some railroad tracks i believe . 
  compared to austrians , the serbs are managing vojvodina very badly . 
  they do feel a bit better i think , but they have a history of a properly managed society , which the rest of serbia does not . 
  ummm ... 
  i do n't think this would 've actually happened . 
  with programming , you would n't even need to learn a second language , except the basics of it just to pass immigration test . 
   the uk is a net-importer by a large margin , many eu countries would be hit hard if it was lost from the single market , assuming it was of course . 
  ... and that 's how we start measuring who 's going to lose more in a conflict . 
  that 's some vladimir putin logic , right there . 
  `` we 'll lose , but you guys will lose even more !, 
  it is still bad , and that 's how civil wars start and escalate . 
  tolerate and justify small crimes , and people committing them will start thinking bigger crimes are ok as well . 
  being from serbia , i know very well how dangerous that spiral can be . 
  understandable , yes . 
  justifiable , no , never . 
  the law should protect everyone , irregardless of their political opinions . 
  they were fired , but not manhandled and thrown into a dumpster . 
  that would still be illegal despite their opinions , would n't it ? 
  do n't forget knowledge . 
  wageningen university is all about agriculture . 
  are you freaking serious ? 
  despite the war , the freedom of speech and opinion should be sacred and nobody should be humiliated because of it . 
  that is the path to madness and dictatorship . 
  even if true , it does n't excuse this behaviour . 
   all other countries in the eu make everyone pay their tolls incorrect . 
  in belgium and the netherlands at least there are no tolls , the roads are paid for by taxpayers ' money . 
  and at the same time , people have issues with their residence showing up on google street view . 
  if you are black though , you will be curiously looked at , and it may be that people will want to take selfies with you at parties . 
   but assuming the roads are funded by more than the sales tax you spent in germany , then you are gaining use of a product that you have n't paid for . 
  true , but so are germans on dutch roads , which i do pay for . 
  one of the points of the eu should be that we trust each other and do not bean count like this . 
   in my mind , it wo n't put people off going to germany . 
  for leisure activities , probably not . 
  for the shopping trips , it will . 
  what is the point of going to germany to buy gas if the toll negates the price difference ? 
  as someone who lives in the nl , 10km from the german border , it is not reasonable at all . 
  i make frequent day-trips to germany , either to buy stuff or for leisure . 
  in both cases i leave way more than $ 10 in germany . 
  however , i never make these trips twice in 10 days . 
  for me , this is basically $ 10 per trip . 
  it sucks , and is discouraging . 
  the winners will be overcharging dutch tank stations and supermarkets , the losers will be foreign citizens living close to the german border and german companies situated close to the border . 
  for girls , it 's not a very high bar to set . 
   it also almost seems like they were looking for differences after balkan wars to make a case they are languages . 
  that is exactly what happened . 
  there are also dialects of serbian spoken in southern serbia that are further apart from standard serbian than standard serbian and standard croatian are from each other . 
   i grew up reading italian comics that were translated to serbo-croatian with croatian dialect . 
  alan ford  also , girls speaking in dalmatian accent . 
  * melts *, 
  i would really , really like it if you were right . 
  but the results of the survey , and at least my general experience , beg to disagree . 
  no , that small part is probably very secured already . 
  i 'm talking about the rest of the croatia-bosnia border . 
  not gon na be easy , though . 
  they have that mega-border with bosnia that will be very difficult to secure properly . 
  this thread is not at all a representative of the entire europe . 
  the uk is quite liked . 
  i honestly think you 're wrong - the uk is quite liked accross europe . 
  there was a thread on this sub a few days ago about how romanians feel about other countries - more than 80 % said they like the uk , despite british media writing horrible things about them . 
  true . 
  fixed . 
  would n't want to get arrested . 
  how come you dislike belarus but have no issues with russia ? 
  mixed feelings for : uk due to their extremely harsh visa policy for me , and for choosing to confront the eu instead of trying to fix it . 
  on the other hand , the uk is awesome in so many ways that i do n't even know where to start . 
  hungary - i really do n't understand the entire orban thing . 
  i mean , it is ridiculous . 
  turkey - same as for hungary , just replace orban with erdogan . 
  russia - most of the russians i met are awesome , smart and trustworthy people . 
  but then they go and say putin is good . 
  cognitive dissonance +1 . 
  i honestly do n't think we 're any different , and would n't have been any different if we were given the opportunity they had . 
  my wife and i are consciously postponing having a child because we want to enjoy life some more . 
  and the costs involved are so astonishingly high that we 're only going to have only one anyway . 
  i know many people my age ( 30 ) feel and do the same . 
  albanians have a reputation in serbia for being a very good bakers . 
  i 'm sorry that criminals who are doing this are slowly succeeding . 
  the one albanian-owned bakery we had in downtown belgrade has been closed for years now . 
  edit : it is escalating , three cases of attacks on albanian-owned bakeries so far :( sombor , stara pazova and novi sad . 
  serbia and croatia have played games recently without any incidents . 
  he 's right , though . 
  it 's the same in serbia , except it 's normally the other way round , people do church wedding first , and then the real one after . 
  and the congratulations are given after the latter . 
  not all europeans , i 'm pretty sure a vast majority of people would want uk to stay . 
  there is some butthurt going on , though , but that 's maybe understandable . 
  well i 'm certainly not gon na believe you . 
  you my friend are shaming that flag you have next to your user name . 
  55 % for , the latest i 've seen about a week ago . 
  psycho . 
  well that shows how much i follow football , 
   on oct 14th there is a football match in serbia there are football matches in serbia every day  but on oct 14th there is indeed a friendly between serbia and albania . 
  which i find really nice . 
  the funny thing is , this map is almost the complete reverse of the kosovo recognition map . 
  if only it were that easy . 
  they do n't really care about their own troops . 
  russian government has never really cared about russians .

  i said his nationality was austro - hungarian . 
   nationality is the legal relationship between a person and a state since he was born in it , he was an ah national , with ah passport and citizenship . 
  dunno why you brought the ethnicity into the conversation though we 're not discussing about his right now . 
  ethnicity and nationality are different things . 
  stvarno cirkus od linka, 
  spanish people , for sure . 
  closely followed by the french, 
  here it 's as in english ( eych en em ), 
  get it ? 
  does n't change the fact his nationality was austro - hungarian . 
  hah , i know . 
  i think even i at some point a year or two ago argued with him about some aspect of it, 
  heh more like traditional , 
  on topic of wiki i always wondered why does serbocroatian one exist, 
  mustve been changed recently then . 
  still it 's the only one saying he 's croatian too . 
  croatia was not a country back then so it makes 0 sense stating his nationality was one that didnt exist at the time, 
   as i 've argued with a particular estonian a couple of times now lmao got ta be / u/h2ppyme, 
  not my native , but the croatian wikipedia is the only one calling nikola tesla a croat, 
  normalno . 
  postoji written intelligibility i spoken . 
  njihov written je dosta visi nego spoken, 
  za topic si u pravu , al generalno znanje 0, 
  even in the rare cases i could pick serbian i stick with english . 
  same goes for phone language , windows is in english , watching media in english without the subtitles browsing in english etc, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e7wubj4mvu https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhpfrfhuiq8, 
  yes, 
  something that could be average or good but surely not bad, 
  who mentioned high level of life ? 
  low gdp doesnt necessarily relate to bad life . 
  all of them, 
  what `` other moons '' ? 
  the moon is one - and it 's the satellite that orbits the earth . 
  the satellites that orbit other planets have different names . 
  bodies orbiting jupiter , for example , are n't `` moons '' , they 're satellites . 
  atlantis would be great imo, 
  could be . 
  it 's not really a myth that anyone believes it 's more of a stereotype used only in jokes, 
  there is that you 're gays, 
  czech rep is only slightly bigger than serbia lol, 
  dunno what you mean , but he has edited his post after mine . 
  when i posted it only contained the link . 
  is that something like gossip girl ? 
  / r / ** ask ** europe, 
  that 's very pointless imo, 
  not only that it 's weird , it 's also becoming a cliche, 
  i find the irish people to be nicer people , in terms of arrogance and politeness, 
  i dont think the number of people having aids in german is that high . 
  4 times of a really low percentile is still a rather low percentile, 
   the bad relation to croatia is because of the croatian independence war , try ww2 . 
  most of your post is a joke anyway, 
  because it 's not ? 
  we 're in good relations with mne , hun , bul , rom , mkd oh and here 's something for you , op : https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/loaded-question, 
  the construction is under way, 
  yes . 
  it was anounced in 2015 , starter building autumn 2016 . 
  i know the feel . 
  once you go competitive you never come back, 
  ets actually is a chill game , too bad i do n't have the patience haha, 
  [ this is being built in belgrade ] ( http://www.elgreco.rs/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/beograd-na-vodi.jpg ), 
  norway croatia turkey, 
  buses , trams and trolleybuses, 
  what ? 
  you ca n't change your name just because ? 
  here you can do it for any reason i think, 
  that 's because russian authors from the time were , undeniably , the best . 
  specifically novelists . 
  the same way you probably know more american movies than german ones . 
  then why do you ask why people like russian culture ? 
  i personally am not a fan but i can see the appeal . 
  then again , ive had similar experience with the french and spanish too, 
  havent you read any russian literature ? 
  or listened to russian composers ? 
  also russian is prettier than polish, 
  at least 500 $ imo . 
  beware of cafes in paris monaco they can be very expensive . 
  also could you link me the tour programme ? 
  i 'm really interested how it looks like, 
  i know all the states but i do n't know any state specific stereotypes . 
  i have the ones regarding the south/bible belt , new england and mid-west, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.belgradewaterfront.com/en/ ) will probably be , currently its dedinje - for belgrade . 
  outside of belgrade we have zlatibor where the prices are going rampant for a while, 
  lot 's of people in america that have 6 figure wages could afford this place but they 're not considered really millionaires , as americans buy property with loans , so they would n't need to accumulate over a million dollars, 
  badly , but not as badly as hitler, 
  prague and budapest one . 
  mediterreanian cities are depressing during the winter . 
  they are built to house the summer population which is 2-6 times higher so during the winter they look like ghost towns . 
  before someone says `` who cares the architecture is still there '' sure , but visiting city is much better when it 's vibrant and full of people . 
  also february is quite rainy and cloudy on mediterranean source : been there , done that, 
  is it and people like him were saying the same thing 30 years ago when it started being popular, 
  dunno if you misunderstood me . 
  pointing at something is rude in general , but even more so pointing at a person, 
  rafting , hiking , swimming and fishing in montenegro . 
  everything is close, 
  not very familiar with eu 's single market laws , but i am familiar with competition . 
  imagine : you and i are selling vegetables on my uncle john 's market . 
  we have similar prices and our market share ( heh ) is about the same . 
  one day my uncle john comes and tells me i do n't need to pay the booth rent for 3 years . 
  so what do i do ? 
  i lower my prices to drastically ( since my costs lowered i can lower my income without lowing my profit ) and i knock you out of the market because everyone will be buying my 1 $ / kg bannanas instead of your 1.5 $ bananas .

you confirmed my quote . 
  well , i 'm on vacation , so i wo n't bother explaing the genocides commited by serbs against muslims in fo\u010da region in 1943 , against hundreds of thousands of serbs in independent state of croatia 1941-1945 , agains muslims of srebrenica in july 1995 and serbs of krajina in croatia in august 1995 . 
  i wish you a joyfull , happy life , and christ already knows about all what has been destroyed and about all that have been killed . 
  at least he will have no mercy towarda lies when the day comes ... 
  * there would be no war if we did n't want one * ( rata ne bi bilo da ga mi nismo \u017eeljeli ) franjo tu\u0111man , 1st president of croatia , may 1992 , ban jela\u010di\u0107 square , zagreb , croatia, 
  that i agree . 
  yes , they `` liberated '' it from 250.000 serbs . 
  but of course , because us generals were the mastermind of their tactics , the int . 
  tribunal liberated the croatian generals after appeal , although they were at first found guilty . 
  and do n't even think i like or aprove of the many , many , serb crimes , but this `` celebration of victory '' is propostrous . 
  at least when christ comes for the 2nd time , everyone will find out the * whole * truth . 
  it 's a 1985 patriotic movie . 
  most nations on earth produce that form of entertainment and light propaganda ... * sigh *, 
  fake news , 
  i think the tent is mutimir 's  i understand most of it , but we could use someone bulgarian to summarize . 
  dude , thanks for you 're effort !, 
  i know many of these things , it 's just that one needs to be strict towards oneself first , then to his family/tribe/nation and then to everyone in the world . 
  thus , it 's necessary to keep pointing out and disagreeing with everything wrong with ourselves , and then with others , in order to slowly achieve a better world . 
  those are not my ideas , wiseguys had that figured out millennia ago , and some of them are quite famous  got ta run now . 
  take care . 
  being a serb , it 's all greek to me ... 
  no , i meant it 's hard to explain why such statements ( and states of mind in general ) exist at all . 
  victim complex ? 
  i 'm not a muslim nor a gypsy ... we might as well stop , it 's been removed ... 
  it all started with discussions ... 
  but almost no one was there to be shocked . 
  and if i saw someone shooting jews or putting poles inside a concentration camp , i 'd be expected to say arguments against it and not just be shocked for a moment ? 
  well , anyway , this has been removed i believe . 
  sorry , nope ... 
  and yet the true question never gets answered ? 
  also , i 'd appreciate if someone from the mod team would care to explain why they allow these posts , and yet ban for genocide denial , which is a thing i really like that they do . 
  this kind of posts are the ones that lead to genocide , potentially . 
  even with that explanation it 's difficult to understand : /, 
  actually , i currently live next to it . 
  i have no problems , and i hope the roma have no problems with me . 
  why delete it ? 
  we could talk about it ? 
  yes , with that i agree . 
  many , many things were illegitimate , but fuck it , all those borders changing - who knew anymore what was legitimate and what was n't . 
  that 's war folks ... 
  well , this is racism ... 
  but i guess that 's ok here . 
  yup , understand you completely . 
  tvrtko jakovina recently said that the creation of yugoslavia was good for the croats at that time . 
  otherwise , italians and hungarians would have taken a part , and dalmatia would have gone to serbia to a significant degree . 
  the problem is the `` lako je biti general posle bitke '' syndrome . 
  now that we know how things turned out , we are prompt to invent different narratives and imagine what the people and politicians felt and wanted at the time , in order to justify the current ( mostly bad ) situation . 
  the bottom line is : 1 . 
  croats need to , at least for a minute , appreciate the fact that the victorious serbian army and leadership at that point in history in late 1918 had the diplomatic and military ability and willingness to create a state that allowed that the majority of croats stay in one country , where they 'd , at least formally , be equal partners - kingdom of serbs , croats and slovenians 2 . 
  the serbs need to realize that it was n't just their good will and nobility that made yugoslavia possible , but rather a lot of ambition and greed from the king and a circle of people around him , that wanted to rule a state far greater then they could handle . 
  a state of the ~ same people , but whose parts lived through centuries of different foreign influences , divided into 3 religions ... a state doomed to fall apart . 
  it was n't abolished but it was far from a stakeholder by late november . 
  the national council was your de facto parliament at the time , and it encompassed a number of sabor delegates . 
  i pretty much agree with everything you said . 
  i 'm also sure a-h would have improved over time , like the entire world tends to ( at least i believe ) . 
  in a way , yugoslavia endedup being a sort of a-h 2.0 . 
  to me , neither one is heroism . 
  the assassination of f. f. and his wife was a cowardly , irrational act , as i described earlier . 
  however , f. f. did represent a state that occupied the land of bosnia , without any right to do so . 
  the assassination of our king was also a cowardly , irrational act . 
  i know they were part of young bosnia , just like everyone else . 
  i did n't imply anything , i just wrote that with a symbolical `` if ever truly '' in order to stress my sadness and disbelief when i see how the majority of them approach the story of young bosnia and gavrilo princip nowadays . 
  ^ this . 
  no , the national council was your parliament at the time . 
  [ on 23 -- 24 november , the national council declared `` unification of the state of slovenes , croats and serbs formed on the entire , contiguous south-slavic area of the former austria-hungary with the kingdom of serbia and montenegro into a unified state of slovenes , croats and serb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_of_slovenes,_croats_and_serbs#creation_of_yugoslavia ) . 
   caused a mini ice age the world needs one of those right now ... 
  sorry , you 're right . 
  he considered himself a serb even in the womb of his mother . 
  * giggles in serbian *, 
  that was after the war . 
  i was talking about the status quo of the black hand before the assassination . 
  no , that was almost 40 years after the events we 're talking about . 
  add the [ ... is fire ] flair . 
  this has 29 upovotes !, 
  the axis of evil , 
   but bosnia was n't serbian land what does serbia have to do with all of this . 
  gavrilo was a yugoslav nationalist and a native to bosnia . 
   but bosnia was n't serbian land , it was ottoman it was n't ottoman , it was occupied by the ottomans ( like serbia ) during the 15th century . 
  and after the ottomans it was occupied by ah , as you say . 
   i highly doubt that the majority of catholics and muslims of bosnia preferred kingdom of serbia over austro-hungarian empire . 
  reading all of the declarations from zagreb and split in 1918 about the unification of south slavs into one state ( not serbia ! , but a mutual kingdom ) makes me think otherwise . 
  also , the black hand , which princip was a member of , had serbian , croat and muslim members and affiliates . 
  nobel prize wining croat ivo andric to name one . 
  yes , i know . 
  but tell that to u/badblueboy146 . 
  * many * serbs consider him a hero , but not * all * . 
  i , for example , am a serb , but i do not view the act of a cold-blooded murder of an unarmed man and woman as heroic . 
  however !, 
  the austro-hungarian empire de facto occupied bosnia . 
  imagine , for example , serbia taking control of , for example , namibia . 
  and then our vice-president , a cool guy wanting to accommodate the namibians into the serbian empire , comes to pay a visit to namibia , and a local guy shoots him . 
  a cowardly act - sure . 
  but killing one of the leaders of the force that 's occupying your country - one ca n't be judged too harshly . 
  yes . 
  the kingdom plaque mentions vidovdan , an important day for the serbs because of the [ kosovo battle myth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kosovo#legacy ) . 
  then there 's no more vidovdan in communist yugoslavia , but the fight for freedom and against oppression remains , and princip is still viewed as a hero . 
  after the war of 1991-1995 , the three peoples within bosnia ca n't find a common ground for pretty much anything . 
  the serbs still view princip as a hero , and the bosniaks ( who are the majority in sarajevo ) have distanced themselves from princip 's ideas and actions ... 
  at this historic point gavrilo princip forbode freedom , on vidovdan the 28th of june 1914 2 . 
  from this place on the 28th of june 1914 gavrilo princip with his shot expressed the people 's protest against tyranny and the centuries-long aspiration for freedom of our peoples 3 .

  i did n't see one good argument in this thread which would explain why people are bothered by the israeli flag . 
  the continent argument is bullshit . 
  the occupied territories argument is weak since there are plenty of other occupied territories that no one cares about . 
  until someone makes a rational argument why the israeli flag is not appropriate for / r/europe i have no doubt that everyone arguing against it is a closet-racist . 
  it was historically part of europe until at least the 7th century , a few hundred years in the 12-13th century , and then again since 1948 . 
  if i wanted to be offensive i could say it was on european maps longer than sweden . 
  turks took over the byzantine empire and they did n't assimilate it in a day . 
  eastern roman culture remained there for the next 1000 years , greeks and armenians were living there until 1918 . 
  after 1918 turkey changed to a secular country . 
  so you can say that there was never a period when turkey was a uniform country with a single heritage . 
  hmm proof that ** parts ** of turkey is more european than ** parts ** of france ? 
  easy . 
  girls in izmir : http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/9125_143040387606_3100091_n.jpg girls in cluny : http://www.catholicnews-tt.net/joomla/images/imgs/feb2012/sjc175closemass.jpg, 
  they come out when it 's full moon . 
   ever has been and never will be , by any definition that 's ever been in common use . 
  you 're one of those people that still think europe and asia are not the same continent ? 
   i do n't support it . 
  why do you oppose discussion ? 
  would you throw a nazi-fit-of-rage if it was ? 
  i think istanbul is a very mixed city , so you have atheists and fanatics too ... but tekirdag , izmir or trabzon felt very eastern european to me . 
  the people are nationalists and not religious ( in izmir they even laughed at islam being nonsense when talking to me ) . 
  the buildings look like belgrade . 
  the people dress like in eastern europe ( including girls in tight jeans or miniskirts ) . 
  they drink raki which tastes almost like metaxa . 
  of course in eastern turkey it 's like an arab country . 
  my point is it 's a large country and you ca n't define them as `` a muslim country '' . 
  too much birthmarks , otherwise hot, 
  turks on the other hand have a lot in common with greeks , which is not surprising since they assimilated a lot of greek culture . 
  the turks in western turkey are culturally 100 % europeans . 
  you on the other hand seem to be part of the proud 19th century european culture of racism . 
  some parts of turkey are more european culturally than france is . 
  you should travel more , maybe you 'll lose some of that racist hatered you seem to cultivate . 
   they are not on the european continent ** you 're ** not on the european continent . 
  who the fuck allowed you to use that flag in / r/europe ? 
  interesting thread , gathers all the closet-racists in one place . 
  keep on hating you disgusting worms . 
  i disagree, 
  wrong . 
   please do not try and hang a certain twisted logic on to me . 
  it was you who brought up norway in the first place , and what i said about norway is rather simple and true : the point is ** i ** do n't know that because i have n't read on the subject . 
  i 'm trying to point out that * even less * people know what 's happening in hungary which is why someone can claim that hungarians do n't care and then you have this whole thread with people crying how gypsies are living like the jews in ww2 . 
  that post has been deleted btw . 
  the thread starter has deleted his account as well . 
  i suspect this was just a one-off trolling attempt and / r/europe is just eager to badmouth hungary so you all took the bait . 
  i think this is because the government is particularly anti-liberal so it conflicts with the philosophi of most ( young ) people on this forum . 
  but that does n't mean they 're right * or * that they 're the majority . 
  they are only the majority on this forum . 
  and although i do n't particularly agree with the fidesz government i still hate listening to * lies * about my country . 
  i do n't care what the dutch government is doing , it has no power in hungary . 
  the us however does . 
  russia has played the divide and conquer game in eastern europe , we now pay more for gas than western europe . 
  where 's the united european front when you need it ? 
  true , but in this video they mostly used words that are of latin origin in english . 
  for example , they could 've used words like belief , fatherlike or hardship and then suddenly the video would n't be funny anymore . 
  `` compared to ** latin ** languages '', 
  the less the better . 
  prism . 
  gas deals . 
  the added flavor to this issue is that i personally do n't agree with discriminating products that come from the west bank . 
  so this law was pushed by a pro-palestinian lobby with whom not everyone agrees with . 
  i think we can agree that the us and russia are more damaging to the eu than israel is . 
  however , they actually have the muscles to fight back . 
  there are n't enough ( competent ) programmers . 
  my company has a plan to hire ~ 100 developers this year and i think they managed less than 30 so far . 
  there are tonnes of outsourcing companies in eastern europe, 
  autonomy is owned by hp . 
  there was a scandal about it , the ceo of hp got sacked for paying too much for it . 
  there 's lots of stuff made in israel , like tooth paste , soap and sticking bandages ( hansaplast i think ? ), 
  i discovered this when i traveled to syria and they sometimes check if you have anything in your bag that 's `` made in israel '' . 
  it 's remarkable how quickly society changes . 
  i know ~ 15 years ago i wrote on some forum how gay people should be beaten up in school so they would turn out straight ... cause that 's what everyone thought ... and today i ca n't believe that it was me writing that . 
  but the post is still there online ... :(, 
   most of the drug dealers are white hungarians proof or you 're racist . 
  did it ? 
  you know i do n't know about that , cause i have n't heard anything on the news . 
  which according to your logic means that they have n't stood up for the victims and they are evil and ignorant . 
  here are some articles about hungarians expressing their grief for the victims and/or outrage towards the purpotrators : [ remembering the roma murders ( 2013/02/24 ) ] ( http://ujszo.com/online/kulfold/2013/02/24/a-romagyilkossagok-aldozataira-emlekeztek ) [ remembering the roma victims ( 2013/02/23 ) ] ( http://mno.hu/belfold/a-tatarszentgyorgyi-gyilkossag-aldozataira-emlekezett-az-emmi-1140879 ) [ paintings in remembrance of the victims ( 2012/02/23 ) ] ( http://www.bodvalenke.eu/emlekezes-cigany-sorozatgyilkossag-aldozataira ) [ former pm shows up during trial to show his support ( 2011/04/05 ) ] ( http://ujszo.com/online/kulfold/2011/04/05/gyurcsany-ferenc-is-megjelent-a-romagyilkossagok-targyalasan ) [ roma and non-roma organisations remembering the victims at the cemetary ( 2010/02/23 ) ] ( http://www.romnet.hu/hirek/2010/02/23/tatarszentgyorgyi_gyilkossag_-_emlekezes_az_aldozatokra_az_evfordulon ) [ gypsies are part of this nation 's body - former president ( 2009/02/28 ) ] ( http://c-press.hu/200902284375/belfold/solyom-nyilatkozott-a-roma-ugyben.html ) [ this wikipedia article ] ( http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_tat%c3%a1rszentgy%c3%b6rgyi_gyilkoss%c3%a1g ) i wo n't translate them . 
  really , i 'm getting tired of this shit and anti-hungarian hatred on this subreddit . 
  i 've been on this subreddit for almost 2 years and the only positive thread i 've read about hungary was the one that i posted myself . 
  you people wo n't check any facts , so just downvote away ... 
  to be specific , they were charged with 5 counts : premeditated murder , mass homicide , endangering many people , murdering people younger than 14 years and `` evil intent '' ( not sure what a better translation would be ) . 
  a few of these charges carries a life sentence . 
  but no , they were n't charged with terrorism . 
  you should probably ask the prosecutor why not . 
  perhaps it 's more difficult to prove ? 
  my bad . 
  let 's rephrase : since this incident , has there been any other ? 
  if yes then it could be a larger problem . 
  if not then it could be a one-off incident . 
  breivik murdered 69 teenagers but i do n't see anyone calling the norvegians names . 
  i wrote civilized * environment * which is a completely different thing than a whole country . 
  an environment can , for example , mean a single family . 
  a family where the mother is an alcoholic whore and the father is in jail and the kids are sniffing glue while avoiding school is not what i 'd call civilized in the 21st century , but maybe you have a different definition so i wo n't go further with this . 
   why the relatives of these dead apparently have n't been able to claim such compensation is , of course , a different question ... you should probably ask them why they have n't filed the required forms . 
  i see , and countries that do n't have victim compensation are not ** civilized ** ? 
   you seem to have a good crack at it , though . 
  now you 're just becoming personal . 
  did i hurt your feelings ? 
  it might seem strange now but 20 years ago gay people were afraid to `` come out of the closet '' in the us too . 
  you can say that montenegro is `` just '' 20 years behind the us .

  on the other hand i love my other grandparents ' countryside . 
  not really aiming to make this a sob story , just an experience . 
  my family and i were very close to getting killed during the bombing . 
  as food was scarce in the cities , when the bombing started we packed our stuff and went to stay with my grandparents at the country side . 
  nato typically went for the major bridges , so my father used a less major routes . 
  we listened to radio as the bomb targets were announced , but for some reason we did n't catch up the announcment of the bridge ahead of us . 
  when we approached the bridge , there , thankfully were people waving and yelling to stop . 
  a couple of minutes later later the bridge blew into pieces . 
  i 'm not from the eu to mind it in the first place , but israel . 
  * pats the bot *, 
  yea . 
  i did n't mean the comparative matching is the same . 
  services tend to be cheap here . 
  you can even get haircut for less than 2e , but the difference to a 3e or 4e hairdresser is big , so i 'd only recommend it if you 're doing a short hairstyle . 
  salaries match the prices here , just as they do in switzerland :p, 
  i should add something that 's probably of everyone 's interest : cable + internet ( 60mbps down , 10 up ) - 28e, 
  there are some in belgrade , novi sad and zlatibor i guess . 
  i hear english maybe once daily when i 'm around the city , so they 're kinda rare . 
  they do go a lot to clubs and splavs so they make up a big % there . 
  we are definitely not a tourist destination , but compared to 10-15 years ago i think tourist numbers have tripled , or quadrupled . 
   we have so much to offer at very high prices though, 
  certainly far better than hbo go , but still not good enough imo . 
  the reason it 's not good enough is that we ( everyone in europe , really ) pay pretty much the same price as the american users , yet only have 1/3 or so of their library . 
  serbia : 2910 croatia : 2901 i 'll take it, 
  well , idk where you are from , but here are some supermarket prices so you can compare : ground beef 1kg - 5e ground pork 1kg - 4e chicken drumsticks 1kg - 3e chicken breasts 1kg - 4e yogurt 1kg - 0.80 e thomy mayo 170g - 0.80 e polimark mayo 500g - 1.5 e dijamant tartar sauce 300g - 0.80 e ( their mayo is probably cheaper ) margarine 250g - 0.5 e butter 125g - 1.30 e milk 1l ( the best brand , imo ) - 0.80 e 10 eggs - 1.20 e white bread 500g - 0.5 e coca cola 2l - 1e beers in a can - 0.60 e to 1e beers in a bottle - 0.45 e to 0.60 e fishsticks 1kg - 5e bottled water 1.5 l - 0.35 e pack of malboro cigs - up to 2.50 e ( depending on which i guess ) haircut typically around 3e, 
  it 's used to describe a person whose 1 parent is white and the other is black . 
  we do n't really consider word `` negro '' to be derogatory , [ but some could ] ( http://www.gradsubotica.co.rs/wp-content/uploads/file/izvinite-gospodjo.jpg ), 
  actually viennese and our coffehouse cultures are extremely similar . 
  the interiors are similar and the time spent in them is too . 
  ours are more likely to have wide beer selection and sandwitch snacks , while theirs are more likely to have pastry/sweets . 
  actually that 's a common misconception here . 
  sure some people that are in between jobs visit , but people that have n't been employed in a while visit cafes very rarely . 
  we are n't really a welfare state , so people with no income do n't really spend 1e for a coffee . 
  albanska golgota, 
  [ serbian retreat through albania in ww1 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbian_army%27s_retreat_through_albania ) 240 000 died . 
  weird that `` calling us eastern european '' does n't come with that, 
  well , i do n't know if everyone calls it that . 
  well what we call `` meat pie '' is kinda like borek . 
  something like [ this ] ( https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wtuy3xhadf8/vr8pntva8ai/aaaaaaaagfg/homiop4ztpc/s1600/pita%2bsa%2bmesom.jpg ), 
   i know that lithuania/latvia/estonia are not slavic but in the context of tracksuits and vodka the slavic influence is indeed relevant and a 50 years oppression that ended just 26 years ago is not something that can be ignored or unnoticed . 
  i think that tracksuit thing is n't necessarily slavic , because i ca n't really remember the last time i 've seen anyone wear it lol . 
  it 's more tied to that region of ex ussr countries i guess, 
  some reddit apps only show the written flairs , not the flags . 
  the problem is that the surgery was extremely costly ( it was in the usa after all ) , and the transportation of a child with such condition was extremely costly as well , and the state did n't cover the expenses fully , so the family had to raise an abnormal amount of money . 
  the hospital or the transporting company would n't have her before the bill was paid . 
  of course they are related . 
  the state did n't donate enough money for a life threatening situation of a 6 ( or something year old ) that resulted in her death , but donated 90 % for a non life threatening operation shortly after . 
  and before you say `` should 've donated to both '' remember that our country is not as rich as yours . 
  besides the most prevelent ones that may or may not be true ( fat , guns , dumb , uneducated , loud ) , i 've yet to meet an american who is n't : - self righteous - ignorant about pretty much anything non us related - prejudiced ( comes off from ignorance , probably ) - friendly, 
  well no one is gon na shout at you `` ha are n't you americans all fat ?

  we had an army major recently that became a she . 
  it caused an uproar because the country subsidized 90 % of the operation costs . 
  people were unhappy because a little girl died just before that because the state was incompetent to organize her heart transplantation operation in houston quickly enough , so people donated money to the family via sms . 
  unfortunately we were late . 
  greece and russia were/are the closest we have to allies , but if things `` get real '' we are fucked honestly . 
  greece is aligned with the guys it could `` get real '' with and russia would n't do shit nowadays . 
  historically though , they both aided us big time in world wars , especially in ww1 , in which russia entered the war after ah declared war on us and greece which took our population migration in after ah broke the front 1 year afterwards .

  both of my mother 's and father 's families are from rural mountainous parts of montenegro that were up until recently cut out from the world .

   i 've a culture too . 
  the way i cook , the way i think , my cultural references , my accent , are rather typical of a french person . 
  and all of that is passed from your ancestors , 
  pretty sure that 's a reason why some families do n't have family trees . 
  i got ta agree . 
  though a bigger issue i have with it is the climate . 
  during the summer podgorica is a literal h e l l . while during the winter the winds fuck you up . 
  the deal is : i 'm not arguing whether or not should you be a baltic country , i 'm debating to why you are considered as one by 99 % of the people . 
  maybe it 's fitting , maybe it 's not . 
  a lot of things are unfitting , yet are not addressed . 
  finnish or estonian . 
  but i 'll never do it though . 
  gambling is legal in whole europe . 
  though i do n't know anyone who gambles , except for sport betting . 
  the group does n't exist because of the lack of knowledge . 
  regular people do n't group up countries themselves based on their geopolitic importance . 
  it 's not like my grandfather , who only knows of the existance of the countries , woke up and said `` they shall be henceforth known as baltic countries '' . 
  the geopolitic regions are grouped by experienced experts , and this specific groupation is kinda obvious . 
  you all broke off the ussr together , you all joined the eu together , you all rely on nato to defend you from russia , you all joined the eurozone together , your market sizes are very similar , you are detached from other regions : divided from the nordics by sea , russian sphere is on the east and poland is on the south , you 're all net receivers in the eu and using the said funds to recover from communism , companies that opt out to start operating there typically start at all three countries and at the same time eu projects tend to involve all three of you together ( baltic rail , anyone ? 
  ) , so to coordinate that you obviously need some sort of a council . 
  a `` baltic * council '' * refers to the geopolitical groupation , not etno-linguistic all of those make enough sense to group you all in one sub-region , does n't it ?

  what 's that supposed to mean ? 
  yup , that 'd work , but that 's a way more drastic change than simply changing the measurement system . 
  that 's a horrible viewpoint . 
  not one person is a * natural serf * , and especially not the entire nation of people . 
  so you 'd prefer that 1 kilometer has 1728 meters ( 12 ^ 3 ) instead of 1000 meters ( 10 ^ 3 ) ? 
  how would that be clearer ? 
  the problem here is the base-10 system that we use . 
  dear guardian , that eu flag is upside down . 
  do n't feed the troll . 
  the bar is so much higher for non-eu citizens , though . 
  i work in a small dutch it company . 
  we are looking for people , and i know people back in serbia who 'd be qualified to fill the positions . 
  but we 're too small and do n't have the capacity to deal with immigration for months to maybe be allowed to import an employee from serbia . 
  our partner company tried and got rejected in the end , on the basis that they `` did n't try hard enough to find a suitable candidate within eu '' . 
  nobody did it say what exactly is `` trying hard enough '' . 
  so it is really difficult . 
  if the british gov ' t wants to close its border for eu citizens , i imagine it will be very difficult for reu to allow brits to still have free access to the work market .

  i really do n't see how is he whitewashing anything in the post above . 
  in general , maybe , i have n't looked at his post history . 
  but all he mentions in the parent is the fact that a civilian train was hit by nato . 
  especially on this sub , where people easily identify person with their flair , and he 's using the serbian one , despite not being from there . 
  his opinions are his alone . 
  i think it is quite clear for what crimes serbia was found guilty , and for what crimes it did not . 
  completely agree , it is a mixed bag . 
  but you said above that serbia is found completely not guilty , and that i still disagree with . 
  that is a matter of semantics in this case , as you moved from ethnicity to state , which is not what op was talking about . 
  the op is right when he says there 's still a `` we did nothing wrong '' mentality among serbs . 
  that is , sadly , especially true for younger generation . 
  also , what you said regarding the court is false . 
  the serbian state was found guilty on failing to move to prevent the genocide and on hiding the suspects after the genocide occured . 
  why did you suddenly move the discussion from republika srpska to republic of serbia ?

  how would you solve the homeless problem ? 
  when answering , do n't forget these two realities : 1 . not all homeless people want to go to shelters 2 . taxpaying citizens prefer not to step into human feces when they go to work in the morning as far as i can see , you could perhaps buy them normal apartments . 
  why would these people get apartments for free while i have to pay if i want to buy one ? 
  you could move them outside the town where there 's plenty of space and perhaps build a large shelter there , but they do n't want to live there because it 's far from the city center where they can beg . 
  so what is the proper solution ? 
  i do n't think sweden is a good rolemodel to follow regarding women 's right where you can get charged for rape for not using a condom . 
  you guys went a little extreme . 
  also you 're confusing culture with discrimination . 
  in your culture it 's probably rude to display any sexual affection in public . 
  in southern countries it 's common to whistle after girls , open the door in front of them , pay dinner for them etc. 
  and slovenia is somewhere in between so you have some of this culture there as well . 
  you 've probably just experienced the negative sides so far ... 
  so perhaps get a boyfriend and see the positive sides too . 
  or perhaps you 're lesbian in which case i do n't know what to say but i knew a lesbian there and she seemed to be doing pretty ok , she did get a job in our company so i disagree that women or lesbians are discriminated . 
  gay rights are generally more respected than in most neighboring countries . 
  mind you this is also a catholic country so traditional families are more respected . 
  your agressiveness towards the people you 're living amongst is not helping .

  as i said , the indo-european people are believed to have moved to europe around 4000 bc . 
  the archeological artifacts you mentioned does n't have writing attached to it . 
  it can be likely that those items were produced by the people your ancestors conquered . 
  because you know , in 4000 bc you guys and the aryans in india are still the same culture , yet in time the two become completely different . 
  under what influence ? 
  perhaps of the conquered peoples ? 
  in case of the aryans we know that they conquered the natives in india , because the natives were sophisticated enough to leave such evidence for us . 
  in case of the germans ... perhaps the natives you conquered only left unidentified axes . 
  my mom bought some pro\u0161ek on the black market this year when she visited croatia ... 
  i mean all indo-europeans came from somewhere around the caucasus during the bronze age , so it is only a theory that your ancestors came to sweden and found unclaimed land . 
  it is more likely that they migrated to sweden during the bronze age ie . 
  4000 bc , they found stone-age natives and stole their land . 
  there was probably some rapin ' going on otherwise they would 've kept their natural dark hair ( and dark skin ? ),

  i see a business oportunity in reimporting the beer to slovenia and selling it for 90 cents ( which would still be cheep ) . 
  i do n't mean the influence or origins , i mean disco and rock were * invented * in the usa . 
  rock music was created as a mixture of american country and blues , which have origins in european and african music , but they did n't exist in europe or africa . 
  the genre would n't have existed unless the very specific american conditions had n't existed . 
  and then that music was exported to the world , together with american fashion , cinema , food ( `` mexican '' food , modern pizza , these are all american foods made by immigrants and perfected by americans ) etc. 
  your denial of american culture and feeling superior is american culture too , because it 's their culture to question authority and think that they 're better than others . 
  you know that whole thing how today you do n't talk to your parents as `` sir '' ? 
  that 's thanks to the american 60 ` es which got exported to europe . 
  the habsburg and the ottoman empire influenced eastern europe a lot more than the gb-france-germany . 
  just because these 3 countries are influential and rich * now * does n't mean they were influential 150-200 years ago . 
  hungarian is a mix of many cultures , you can see this in the language and in the food . 
  the language is ( i think ) 30 % finno-ugric , 25 % slavic , 15 % latin , 15 % german , 5 % turkish , 5 % english-french-italian , 5 % unknown the national food has influences of turkish-iranian , slavic , soviet , italian and french . 
  most of the modern national institutions like the parliament , national museum , national library , opera , public school system etc. 
  were all established in the 19th century and were modeled mostly on habsburg-german examples . 
  the architecture in the 19th century was called hungarian secessionism , it was derived from the viennese art nouveau school with some unique touch ... 
  i would n't say that this was a `` german '' influence , more like an austrian or habsburg since this kind of architecture can mostly be seen in the former habsburg lands and not in germany . 
  then there was some soviet influence after ww2 ... 
  abba = disco = american music beatles = rock = american music need i go further ? 
   in medieval times , it was a bit more complicated . 
  i think that 's the part where the hungarian and romanian histories differ . 
  in hungarian history it 's not complicated at all , the whole area was part of hungary . 
  the romanian arguments feel like trying to make up facts just to prove that somehow transylvania was special , so to justify the current status quo as the natural one . 
  i heard that since mihai viteazul conquered transylvania for 3-4 years ( ? ), 
  in the 17th century that this was foreshadowing a future greater romania and how historically this was bound to happen . 
  in a similar way you have serbs clinging on to `` emperor '' [ jovan nenad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jovan_nenad ) who was some kind of warlord over a territory that matches today 's vojvodina , briefly for a few years . 
  that somehow should explain that this territory always should 've belonged to serbia . 
  and the slovaks have some theory that the hungarians in slovakia are actually assymilated slovaks who forgot their language , so now they need to be forced to `` remember '' it again . 
  all 3 of these theories feel made up and fake , probably because they are . 
  prior to nationalism people were divided based on religion and there was no such thing as ethnic separatism . 
  it would n't be fair because germanic speaking people would find it easier to learn . 
  we would have to take a completely unrelated language , like arabic or chinese , if we wanted to make it truly fair . 
  it depends on the situation . 
  once i 've met a russian who did n't speak english , and since i know serbian we kind of managed to understand each other . 
  in these situations i would use english first though , and if that fails then fall back to another language or hand signals . 
  should n't belgrade be just a blank picture ? 
  which airport will be connected ? 
  a few years ago i went to paris with wizzair , they stop at some airport north of paris and i had to pay 15 euros for the bus to paris center , and then another 5 euros for the rer to the orly airport . 
  the plane ticket from timisoara to paris almost cost less than the actual cost of getting to the other airport .

  the design is shit , and any self respecting priest would condemn such a retarded display . 
   but what about his students who are now in power ? 
  get this through your head : they do n't care . 
  greater serbia ? 
  it was all just a nice show which allowed them to gain power and wealth . 
  now that such an idea has been done to death ( literally ) , they 're milking something else . 
  i hate sns as much as the next guy , but come on ... realize that they never cared about `` greater serbia '' at all , if ever . 
  those close ties which serbia harbors with russia ? 
  yeah , they 're not there because serbia just * loves * russia to bits ... it 's for the veto power russia holds . 
  as long as that 's in place , kosovo wo n't enter the un . 
   btw cyprus and kosovo are 2 different cases whatever helps you sleep at night , buddy . 
  i do n't see why you should n't welcome refugees . 
  the only think you 've realized is that these people are n't refugees at all . 
  well , yeah , i had an idea ... 
  but why so suddenly and en masse ? 
   a lot of people 's life goal is to go and live there for fuck 's sake yes , i know , you were in my neighborhood recently , alongside the syrians and afghans , trying to cross over to hungary ... had no idea what the hell was going on or what the hell prompted so much people to gather up at the pristina bus station to come over . 
  interests . 
  will serbia get anything out of it ? 
  well , there 's your answer . 
  also , recognizing kosovo will mean russophilic nationalists will call for the recognition of crimea and eventually the separation of the republic of srpska from bosnia . 
  there 's also the issue of displaces serbs , and tons of displaced romanis , which will come back to haunt you sooner or later . 
   albanians at the time were not allowed in the serb military anymore . 
  which time was that ? 
  serious question . 
   the government needed to stop being so loyal to brussels and vocalise the potential destruction brexit posed . 
  well , of fucking course you should . 
  if everyone had the guts to say it , maybe we would n't even be in this mess in the first place . 
  it should be read , or at least not banned . 
  it 's like telling your kid not to touch that stupid box you 've got stashed in the corner of your room ... he 's gon na touch it just because . 
  man , i can stand that germanic font for titles ... but using it for the whole damn text ? 
  it 's like that guy from the office who really likes comic sans . 
  you 'll have more luck funding it on irc ( #bookz ) . 
   i think hitler was a political genius * for his time * . 
  it was easy to blame the jews for everything ... who are they going to turn to ? 
  their own country ? 
  pfft . 
  same goes for the gypsies and the gays . 
  no one was there to accept them or to defend them . 
  a perfect scapegoat . 
  even the `` untermenschen '' slavs were just fine when it came to occupied serbia , independent croatia , etc. 
  we 're not in the eu , and it does n't bother us one bit . 
  ^ ^ ^ pls ^ ^ ^ send ^ ^ ^ help, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alcohol_belts_of_europe#/media/file:alcohol_belt.png you 're part of the beer belt . 
  you can not leave . 
  [ ** ever . 
  ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1q2f_18cjg ), 
  my friend lives in thionville and he takes offence to this statement . 
  he also works in luxembourg . 
   which did n't happen . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unification_of_albania_and_kosovo  the ahtisaari plan conditioned kosovo 's independence by adopting a multiethnic `` kosovar , '' rather than an albanian identity . 
  still , gallup surveys revealed that 75 % of kosovo albanians would prefer to live unified with albania in the same country . 
  the same support was seen in albania where 68 % of the citizens of albania preferred a unification of albania with kosovo it wo n't happen because that 's not what was negotiated with any western power . 
  kosovo is supposed to be a `` free , independent , multiethnic state '' . 
  if it were to join albania , shit would hit the fan . 
  that does n't mean most of kosovo and albania does n't support such an idea . 
  still , does n't matter ... it would pass , as all serbs , romanis and many others have been driven out . 
   the only united nations member who recognised the republic of kosova was albania yeah ... 
   in fact a lot of romanians from romania call themselves moldovans that 's ... actually slightly hilarious . 
   only 15 % of brits feel european . 
  i 'd say you 're both . 
  people came from the east , and then they came ( or were brought from ) the west . 
  there 's a bit of everything . 
  the most troubling issue is your religion ( since 9/11 and amplified by the migrant crisis ) . 
  nobody will say it outright , but it 's true . 
  islam used to be considered to be romantic , exotic ... now it 's , well , you get it . 
  you were a scarecrow during the brexit campaign : http://i.imgur.com/yyaq5oy.jpg, 
   la chouffe nigga , do you even westmalle ? 
  with the number of eu citizens currently working in the uk , i 'm guessing this is gon na be interesting to watch . 
   this has been the norm for as long as i remember . 
  this . 
  you can seek refuge or assistance from any eu country 's embassy . 
   with the uk gone i do n't think they 'll even leave . 
  sure , they may `` leave the eu '' , but they 'll stay inside the european free market and very little will change . 
  that way , those who depend on the eu will be fine , and those who hate it will be all like `` hurray , we left !, 
  our refugees are relatively docile . 
  there have been a few stabbings between themselves , and trespassing/petty theft on other people 's property ... but most of the time , they behave . 
  i do n't know if it 's because such crimes go unreported , or because our police and military have a `` did n't see anything '' policy when it comes to dealing a few hits with their police batons . 
  witnessed it myself a few years ago - police chasing migrants and beating them into submission because they refused to comply . 
  nowhere to be reported . 
  this should be a un issue . 
  wo n't accept your own fucking citizens back ? 
  here , have some sanctions . 
  giving citizenship to people means having at least some level of responsibility towards those people . 
   we bribe people from the balkans to cooperate in going home ( so that they can come again for a couple 1000 euro 's ) those are mostly the romani , redneck albanians or dumbass `` 4 years of basic education '' serbs . 
  they will not be able to travel back to collect those couple thousand euros , so they legally change their name , get a new passport , and then try to come over . 
  use fingerprinting , for the love of god , and send them packing . 
   serbia : 35 anecdote : there was one guy on a regional online forum who was asking how to check whether he was barred from entering the eu ( sweden ) due to his refused asylum request in germany . 
  he almost got ( virtually ) fucking lynched right there and then . 
  there he was , a jerkface who went to germany to seek asylum , only to return home with some extra cash , and now he wants to fly to sweden to meet up with an old friend !, 
  send them all back and do n't give them a single fucking cent . 
  we had to stand in line at the hungarian consulate just to get a visa to visit szeged a bit , and most of us were refused . 
  this was only a few years ago . 
  and now these fuckers are ruining the reputation of our shitty passport , and soon enough we 'll have to stand in lines for visas again !, 
  what about in english ? 
  which language do the roma speak ? 
  since when ? 
  first of all , there are way , way more people who already know mandarin and have learned a second language than there are people who know a e.g. 
  english or french and have learned mandarin . 
  the language is tonal , meaning just a minor slip up in how you pronounce a word can butcher up everything . 
  it will take more years than you can imagine to learn it , and even then you 'll have issues with it .
