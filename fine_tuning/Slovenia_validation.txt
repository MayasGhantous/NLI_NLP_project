  the cleveland slovenes were quite pro-domobranski even in the 90 's .

  our country has a lot of hunters and a long hunting tradition ( i do n't and never had hunted ) . 
  i got no problem with people hunting for food , and then taking a trophy , but it seems senseless to me the trophy hunting of top predators . 
  i frequently come across stories of people talking about how overpopulated the deer and boar population has become in parts of usa for example and how much damage they cause , and the hunting is the only thing slowing them down . 
  well , hunt away as much as you want , but the problem began with the loss of predators thus allowing the prey species populations to explode . 
  i live in slovenia , and we lost most of our wolves , lynx , we got a somewhat healthy bear population for our size ( cca 300 ) but it would still be easy to endanger them . 
  tldr : hunting is ok , killing off top predators for fun & trophies , is a dick move and endangers natural balance . 
  i 'll bow to your estimate here , i 'm 37 and had the feeling growing up most people + -5 years around me had no trouble understanding serbo-croatian , that said , i did grow up in a very mixed neighbourhood in a very mixed region ( zasavje ) , could probably also vary along regional lines a lot . 
  way above average for slovenia . 
  we all basically talk 3 or 4 languages . 
  most people over 30 have very good knowledge of serbo-croatian language from our shared past in yugoslavia . 
  most of population ( at least below age 40 ) is english speaking , and around 30-35 % ( according to polls ) knows german language . 
  near the borders people also speak the language of our neighbours ( italian , hungarian ) . 
  i 'm somewhat confident we 're at the top , as far as multilingual nations in europe go . 
  i also have quite a few friends that have moved here from uk and sweden , because the locals mostly all speak english it 's kinda hard to learn our language , as noone has any problems communicating in english . 
  truth be told , i had almost the same situation in sweden , my swedish language skills suffered because almost everyone knew english ( except for the lone croatian guy i came across in gothenburg ) . 
  yes , but you 're mostly talking about economic cost ( i think ) , compared to a possible worldwide catastrophe . 
  in such cases i 'd value safety and overkill over mere money . 
  prepare for worst , and hope for best ? 
  is n't it a bit insane to just gamble on something which is n't known yet to fix things ? 
  i totally agree with you , but then again we were both raised in either yu or ex-yu depending on age , and there was an indcredible comic book scene in yugoslavia . 
  there are whole swaths of sayings that have become a part of public subconscious , almost everyone knows stuff like : `` halo bing , kako brat ? 
  i 'd also put on the best comics list the following : anything by hugo pratt ( corto maltese ) , early marty mystere and dylan dog as my favourites . 
  i also loved all the classics , kapetan miki , blek stena , komandant mark ... but i have a sneaking suspicion that as an adult i would n't like them as much . 
  i do stand corrected , though in that same list just above them in height is the category dinaric slavs which does include amongst them people from montenegro . 
  they are on average 1.7 cm taller . 
  i 'll admit my memory of it comes from an old guiness book of records from the 80 's and in the meantime things have changed a bit it seems . 
  tried looking for historic records of male height in the 1980 's , had some limited success here : https://ourworldindata.org/human-height/, 
  i 'm somewhat sure it was never bosnia , but another ex-yugoslavian country called montenegro . 
  as a kid growing up in slovenia in the 80 's we were regularly reminded that men from montenegro were at that time the second tallest in the world ( after masai ) , but 30 years seems to have shaken the top countries around a bit . 
  kinda funny that the current record ski jump is held by a norwegian and the second place is slovenian , highest mountain in slovenia is 2868 i think , so his theory falls apart even there . 
  well , why not fight for `` special arrangements '' ? 
  and where would you `` deport '' the turks ? 
  i also think you 're very wrong on how native populations view the situation in australia . 
  you 're just very inconsistent in your view . 
  that is why i asked where you would set the limit . 
  if you look back far enough there were migrations all over the place . 
  and ( again ) by your logic and your cutoff time ( columbus and leonardo ) it would mean the forced expulsion of most of usa population , they started the migration there at the same time . 
  how far back in the past would you apply this ? 
  i mean by your logic we should `` kick '' out hungarians of asian descent ? 
  my people ( slavs ) also migrated here , should we self-deport ourselves ? 
  i think your squatter analogy is very weak and unfitting here . 
  in this case i 'd say it is warranted , fepeak uses the same argument against others to dismiss them and as they say : `` turnabout is fair play . '', 
  the second part ( church funding and influence ) definitely , but i believe in informed choice , and that 's something a baby and hell , even sometimes a teenager can not do . 
  i 'm an atheist ( hard to guess , right ? ), 
  but i think religion is a serious issue and should be approached when you have the reasoning skills to choose . 
  one of the things that bothers me about baptising kids ( apart from not having a choice on the matter ) is that the church ( in some countries , mine for example ) then counts every baptised human as a member of that church , even if they never attend and are atheist when they reach the age of reasoning . . 
  in some cases that results in the church getting extra funding and influence . 
  `` rigorous shitposting '' this sounds soooo german to me . 
  bravo . 
  when i was working with them , the geese would regularly kill my ducklings . 
  let 's say that swans are bond villains and geese are drunken hooligans ... 
  they 're both dicks but i think swans are more common . 
  and i can say they 're dicks as i worked as a duckherd for a few years and had geese and chickens in my flock too . 
  you 're all underqualified . 
  i played command & conquer red alert , it 's clearly the obvious choice for qualifications . 
  what is serious here ? 
  to me it all looks pretty silly and absurd . 
  it most definitely is not . 
  [ dialects of rooster ] ( http://www.bootstrappin.com/2008/10/cock-a-doodle-doo-dialects-of-the-rooster/ ) your weird version of rooster speak is in a decided minority .

  i get schwa as translation for `` polglasnik '' . 
  edit : sorry , i thought you meant schwa is n't polglasnik , i only later realised you meant hro\u0161\u010d itself . 
  yes , agreed i just meant hro\u0161\u010d was a word almost impossible to pronounce by scandinavians . 
  edit2 : actually , i just realised i know less about our language than i thought , i think i gave the right answer but i 'll gladly defer to someone with a better explanation . 
  we have a sort of half-wovel sound called `` polglasnik '' in our language , which translates to [ schwa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwa ) i had tons of fun getting scandinavians trying to pronounce `` hro\u0161\u010d '' which means beetle in our language , it just messes them up .

  i spend a lot of time across europe every year , it 's amazing how well known that movie is with people i meet . 
  i 'll list some of my favourite `` balkan '' movies . 
  [ maratonci trce pocasni krug ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27rtq0ttkqq ) , classic black comedy and still works today . 
  [ ko to tamo peva ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwozslas8dm ) , same as above , these two movies might be the most cult classic movies from our area . 
  [ no man 's land ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myma_l-qvzq ) war movie , a co-production won best foreign movie oscar in 2001 [ tockovi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeqrksftt9g ) black comedy tarantino style . 
  [ lepa sela lepo gore ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjahat0pauy ) slightly controversial at the time , black comedy about the war in balkans , known for rebuilding and then reburning a village already damaged in the war . 
  [ rane ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ks7dnlbnk4 ) a gangster movie about the youth in serbia in the aftermath of war . 
  [ kek\u010deve ukane ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmygspp2w_s ) probably best known ( internally ) movie in slovenia , a children 's movie about a good-hearted shepherd boy from 1968 . 
  [ wristcutters ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hemwtkco5sa ) a romantic comedy about suicides and the afterlife . 
  croatian director , israeli book and cool ukrainian music . 
  [ nattevagten ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc9rzpny9ko ) and just for off-colour here is my favourite danish black comedy . 
  the links are to youtube , some are to full movies , some only to trailers , a few even to subtitled full movies . 
  i usually have to jump through a few hoops to get english subtitles for my foreign friends . 
  if i remember correctly he was sentenced under a blasphemy law the uk still has on books , and some tweets from politicians are hinting he was not murdered in prison . 
  i do n't mind being corrected of course . 
  and i did n't mean predatory as in crime ruling the streets , more as in greed is mostly rewarded across the board . 
  have you ever seen any forum conversations about either gun control or health care ? 
  either the usa is horribly dangerous and you need a gun to protect yourself because the cops are too far away , do n't give a fuck or will shoot you on sight or it 's a peace loving country ( apart from some parts which we will exclude ) , health care is horrible obamacare is so expensive people are ready to revolt , or it 's so cheap and available that everyone can have it ( except for millions of uninsured ) . 
  so depending on what one wants to prove ... 
  i do n't believe everything i read , on internet or otherwise , but statistics for murder are what they are , and i 'm trying to understand them . 
  i almost have to compare the us to eu because there is n't a lot of other similary developed countries , australia and japan come to mind but i do n't know a lot about them . 
  but there are a lot of eu countries with a lot of immigrant population and they all have much lower murder rates than usa . 
  predatory might not be the right word , but i 'm not sure how to call a society that worships unbridled capitalism and sees greed as almost a virtue and most of public programs as communism . 
  desperate people in a society with extremely harsh prison terms and very little programs for rehabilitation and easy access to guns just seems like a recipe for crime to bloom . 
  i do n't see the usa as some sort of lawless country but there 's definitely room for improvement . 
  also i do n't think we should be comparing ourselves to mexico , and if we exclude some outliers from europe for being bad apples than the situation becomes even more skewed .

  cornwall has been on my list of places to visit for ages . 
  scilly looks very tropical . 
  when you think of england , you really do n't imagine sunshine , clear blue waters and sand beaches .

  haha , typical patronising `` you 'll get it when you grow older '' . 
  til that every supermodel got to where she is by prostituting herself . 
  listen , i supported the `` yes '' camp . 
  i voted both times . 
  i 'm definitely not defending the idiots on the other side . 
  i 'm just saying that while gay people ca n't get married here , it 's not exactly saudi arabia either . 
  the law will pass eventually , we just need some more time before people see how stupid they 're being by voting against it . 
  while i agree that the results of that referendum were terrible , gay people still have the right to a civil union here and can enjoy most `` marital '' rights . 
  this is one of the downsides of living in a tiny country where holding on to tradition has become the only way to `` protect '' our national identity . 
  unfortunately for the more open minded of us , tradition also includes christianity . 
  does n't matter what you say , she was still a supermodel . 
  i 've never heard of a `` working girl '' that would get on the covers of vogue , vanity fair , harper 's bazaar , gq , allure , etc. 
  i 'm not saying that she did n't marry him for the money , because she most likely did , but calling her a mail order bride or a prostitute is not fair . 
  not sure if that counts . 
  she was a very successful supermodel and was already living in the us when they met . 
  you 're gon na have to move a little bit further east to find those kind of wives . 
   slovenia sucks too r u havin ' a giggle m8 ? 
  slovenia is a fucking fairytale . 
  but italy does n't recognize same sex marriage . 
  you 've just accepted civil unions , something we 've had since 2006 . 
  unfortunately , we probably will . 
  because instead of focusing on the marriage part ( which almost everyone would be willing to accept ) , the opposing side decided to go down the good old `` think of the children ! '', 
  path , which convinced a lot of people to vote no . 
  and to nobody 's surprise , most people who were against it were those of poorer economic bakgrounds and a lower level of education . 
  people who make their decisions based on who screams the loudest in a tv debate , not on actual facts . 
  we 'll get there eventually , but i 'm afraid it wo n't be anytime soon , if they keep giving the public the power to make this decision . 
  yeah sorry about that , i was reading the reply on my phone and did n't see the flair . 
  i had no idea some schools put this much effort into accommodating religious kids . 
  i had no idea this was happening . 
  i guess i never met anyone with a similar experience . 
  nope , this seems really bizzare to me . 
  we had both christians and muslims at school ( the balkan variety ) and nobody ever prayed . 
  nobody ever expressed any kind of interest in it at all . 
  where did you go to school ? 
  yeah , and it 's nothing unusual either . 
  i 've never , ever heard of a government-funded school in europe where any kind of religious ritual would be allowed during school hours . 
  yeah , i definitely agree with that . 
  the coastal areas all look familiar to me , but everything that 's more inland is completely different . 
  na\u0161ice is the farthest i 've ever been in croatia . 
  and while our language was similar , nothing else felt familiar at all . 
  i do n't know , really . . 
  i 'm from the istrian area near the slo-ita border , and the people there really are n't much different from people on the croatian side of istria . 
  the culture is basically the same . 
  but when i visited the more inland parts of your country , it felt quite foreign to me . 
  i loved it , but i did n't feel any kind of connection to those places at all . 
  being from slovenia , i do n't really feel close to any other slavic country . 
  we share a similar language , but that 's about it . 
  culturally , we 're much closer to austria and italy , since our territory was a part of theirs not too long ago . 
  they 're calling them that in reference to old slovenian folklore . 
  back in the middle ages , people thought they were actual dragon babies . 
  wait a minute , do normal people just grab their bread and take it home from the store in their hands ? 
  i do n't consider myself dirty either , but i always get my bread in paper bags . 
  you touch your keys , door handles , money , etc. 
  on the way to the store and back . 
  it ca n't be completely sanitary . 
  even less so in flood water . 
  not surprised about slovenia 's number being so low . 
  we 're apparently very anti-children right now . 
  during my 4 years in high school , only one girl got pregnant , and that was right before graduation . 
  i 'm in my mid 20s now , and only 4 people i know are parents . 
  none are married .

  except eurovision . 
  that is such a weird name for a competition . 
  lmao , you brits are always trying to make yourself feel better by saying `` it 's okay , it 's a joke for us , but everyone else takes it seriously , so it 's no wonder we always lose '' . 
  not the case . 
  eurovision is a joke everywhere . 
  well how would you fix it ? 
  they already have a jury that 's trying to counteract the `` political '' votes . 
  unless you remove the public vote altogether , it 's always going to be at least slightly political . 
  but the `` generic british accent '' is the default accent of the english language . 
  we learn british english in school , not the american version . 
  cartoons helped a lot . 
  during elementary school , we obviously all loved our cartoons . 
  i 'm from slovenia , a bilingual region near the italian border , and there was ( and probably still is ) an interesting divide between children here . 
  about half of us watched cartoon network , while the other half watched cartoons on italian channels ( which are always dubbed ) . 
  so half of us spoke fluent english and were n't as good at italian , while the other half spoke perfect italian and struggled with english . 
  i started learning italian in preschool and english in 3rd or 4th grade of elementary school , but i was ( and still am ) much better at english . 
  i think that when it comes to learning new languages , the media has a much stronger influence on us than formal education . 
  it 's a lovely song , but not really something the eurovision crowd would enjoy . 
  high energy pop songs are where it 's at . 
  everybody knows i 'm the only gay in this village !, 
  it 's great for cv writing though . 
  i officially speak 7 languages now .

  the `` is this happens because we are from bulgaria ??? '', 
  neither , it does n't exist . 
  they just banished people to arezzo instead . 
  heresy, 
  nah , it makes perfect sense . 
  mussolini tried to fight the mafia a lot , and some fled to the us , reinforcing the ranks of the mob that was already present there . 
  plus this , as you said  allies actively cooperated with the mafia during the invasion of sicily . 
  and it 's much easier to portray an american as evil if you associate him with something the local population is very familiar with , in a negative way mainly .

  burja does come in gusts as well ( forgot the word earlier ) so it 's not like we are constantly walking around with those winds . 
  not going to lie , walking around is pretty hard when the wind gets stronger . 
  and you do n't want to walk near the sea , but otherwise its just one step at a time . 
  [ or you can use a skateboard for some street windsurfing if you want ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xwv74endlm ), 
  bura/burja/bora is a wind that comes from the north-east , so in the context of these areas it will always blow towards the sea , not from it . 
  it is weak in summer and more common/stronger in winter . 
  kids get used to it . 
  now , when it goes over 170 km/h you probably let them stay home , but lower than that they can manage just fine . 
  note that it is n't a constant wind , but rather it comes in `` waves '' .

  of course , that would be work . 
  depends on who you ask . 
  in slovenia he 's either a hero or a villain , the opinion varies wildly depending on who you are talking to . 
  or that \u0107evapi are better 50/50 pork & beef instead of just beef, 
  we say we are n't balkan and then half the country is obsessed with ceca , severina , turbofolk etc. 
  something does n't add up if you ask me ... 
  alright sheesh buddy . 
  relax a bit with the attitude , nobody attacked you or your life choices .

  you might not realize it but its true, 
   and 2 out of a 142 is already a huge amount percentage wise while true , there is also the counter-argument of a small sample size .

  probably too cold in bestonia . 
  anyway , on a serious note , i do n't exactly like the welfare hunters either , but you ca n't put them in the same category as the actual wifeburners .

  what you are proposing is a lunacy , my neighbour cant listen to national slovenian music and do various of our stuff because his grandfathers goverment tried to erase our culture ? 
  because they changed our names to be more italian or german , because our language could not be spoken , because you were sent to the battle head-first as your life meant less then of a austrian ... 
  native americans or african-americans are not the only one that we 're opressed . 
  and this punishment for all the `` white people '' , oh they opressed us , now its our payback is laughable ... you can be angry at people because they do n't understand your culture but hell i dont see italians calling americans racist because they have a pizza with 38484 toppings . 
  this has nothing to do with racism or opression . 
  its just people being dicks and stupid . 
  what you are proposing is a hate relationship between cultures because people of other then you enjoy them . 
  people around the world are appropriating so much of the european culture , that we could be angry for decades ...

  ok lets see gdp growth lower then 1.6 % and then from around 6-9 % lower gdp after 15 years and we are talking really talking minimums . 
  i am willing to send you some money if you need it bud  . 
  your delusion knows no bounds . 
  there is no growth forecast from executive summary ... 
   he 's saying that our gdp will grow slower as a result of brexit . 
  not that our gdp will shrink as a result of it . 
  where does it say that ? 
   these estimates are based on the eu as it is today , without further reform . 
  the total cost of leaving is likely to be higher . 
  the new settlement for the uk negotiated by the prime minister in february 2016 included an ambitious agenda of economic reform in the eu . 
  this will include the next stage of development of the single market , with a focus on bringing down the remaining barriers to trade in services , energy and digital , alongside completing major ongoing trade deals . 
  if the economic benefits of reform are realised this could increase uk gdp by up to a further 4 % -- which equates to # 2,800 for every household in the uk . 
  with the uk outside the eu these economic reforms would be less likely to happen . 
  so the cost of exit in terms of the potential loss of gdp would be correspondingly greater . 
   the hm treasury analysis , which is in line with academic research , shows that eu membership increases trade with eu members by around three quarters . 
   almost three quarters of foreign investors cite access to the european market as a reason for their investment in the uk . 
   is estimated that 3.3 million jobs are linked to exports from the uk to other eu countries .

  your country is getting destroeyed m8 . 
   if we take as a central assumption that the uk would seek a negotiated bilateral agreement , like canada has , the costs to britain are clear . 
  based on the treasury 's estimates , our gdp would be 6.2 % lower , families would be # 4,300 worse off and our tax receipts would face an annual # 36 billion black hole . 
  this is more than a third of the nhs budget and equivalent to 8p on the basic rate of income tax . 
   could you tell me which page they forecast the recession on ? 
  i found it my son . 
  as long as 300k people are hitting italians shores every year , right will keep rising .

  would you be ok with being our slaves ? 
  all, 
   back to the previous topic though - they are n't forecasting a recession . 
  thats exactly what they are forecasting ... most were even predicting recession before the actual trigger ... just from market uncertainty . 
   that 's great , but until the negotiations have gotten somewhere , we do n't really know how that will change . 
  not everything will leave london . 
  what they are saying is financal services for entire eu are in london , and dont actually portray the size of uk economy . 
  they estimate that single market boosted uk economy with eu market by some hundred and some billion . 
  and investme from eu countries into uk account for around 30 % of all foreign investment . 
  and that is just the first page . 
  i advise you to read it . 
  now you got me . 
  first , some conservative estimates , tariffs only . 
   a huge 44 per cent of britain 's exports go to the eu - # 220bn out of # 510bn - according to the office of national statistics . 
  if the uk did not negotiate a favourable trade deal with the eu , those exports would be subject to import tariffs as well as extra administrative costs . 
   in the period before any new deal was implemented , the uk would probably have to trade on standard tariffs under world trade organisation rules . 
   an analysis by the independent found that the cost to britain 's exporters -- in extra tariffs alone -- would be at least # 4.5 bn per year . 
  this conservative estimate does not include the difficult-to-measure costs of non-tariff barriers , such as the enforcement of different market standards and regulations . 
  and ofc the really detailed [ report ] ( https://www.cer.org.uk/sites/default/files/smc_final_report_june2014.pdf ) . 
  gdp growth in g10 is laughable . 
  i understand exactly what you are saying but i dont think you understand me . 
  recession is actually predicted when you trigger the article . 
  besides your gdp growth is something over 1 % , not very optimistic . 
  we can expect recession in uk and countries in the eu who trade a lot with you . 
  isnt uk fertility around 1.9 and you are always gon na have commonwealth immigration . 
  the thing is gdp should go down with the population because there will be less consumption . 
  also economy shrinking always creates more unemployment ... 
  no one with a grain of knowledge about economics , would vote leave . 
  why would brexit bring better quality of life ? 
  britain wants their former importance back . 
  sadly they are not gon na get it . 
  brits were getting benefits and benefits , i remember my grandpa coming home from brussel , annoyed as fuck as brits and the dutch often got what they wanted ( if there is one thing you guys hate is regulation ) . 
  the myth that germany or france dictate what happens in eu is simply not true . 
  all your other points like brits dont feel like eu , and all that.eu is diverse as fuck , but what most other countries lack is the british arrogance .

  what is this , fascism ? 
  no , thanks . 
  credit cards here are far from common , the last time i checked anyway . 
  debit cards pretty common .

  marseille is second , lyon third .

  along slovenian short coast there are the northernmost salt pans in mediterranean . 
  they 're open to visit , presenting the old ways of getting salt , which are still being maintained and there 's a specific flora and fauna as at every salt pans . 
  http://www.kpss.si/en/intro the old , little town of [ piran ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/piran ) might be interesting for a short visit , but then again , you 're visiting dubrovnik , so dunno .

  also , highest cliff on adriatic : strunjan cliff . 
  then there 's this nice [ amphitheatre in pula ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pula_arena ) . 
  and quite likely plenty of other stuff down the coast that i 'm not familiar with . 
  if you fancy underground world ( caves ) , there 's plenty in the area , i 'd point out the great unesco-heritage-with-a-canyon \u0160kocjan caves , a tourist-trap-with-train-in-cave postojna cave and my favourite expensive-and-remote - ( and takes lots of time to get it done properly ) kri\u017ena jama .

  ljubljana itself can be done in about 2-3 hours if you rush things . 
  2 nights might be a lot , it 's a small city ( if you 're doing only cities ) . 
  on the other hand , if you wanted to check out more of the country ( which is cooler imho ) , then 2 nights seems fine . 
  ca n't compare vienna or prague to ljubljana in the amount of things to see or places to visit . 
  i really liked tel\u010d for some reason . 
  not that there 's much happening there , just fancy main square and a little park behind the town . 
  a cool place to just chill and relax for a few hours .

  now , when will that happen , i 've no clue . 
  i 'd just like to add that both ireland and uk are outside the schengen area .

  ca n't tell , really . 
  spring 2014 was really warm and nice , but summer was non-stop rain . 
  spring 2013 on the other hand was very rainy and blah . 
  generally march should be ok for ljubljana . 
  higher up ( higher above sea level ) , there can be snow , especially early march . 
  can also be reasonably warm already , though . 
  nothing severe , snow-wise , mind you ; just annoying because it makes everything wet and muddy . 
  depends where you go hiking , expect winter in mountains ( above 1500 m or so ) . 
  i make it sound like it 's all bad , it 's not . 
  just ca n't help but feel sky is grey year-round and the fact that we 've had a ton of rain recently . 
  so , yeah , still winter in mountains , but ljubljana and bled are perfectly fine . 
  march can be reasonably dry month , and the smell of spring in the air and all that . 
  maybe not exactly what you have in mind , but i have in nice memory a part of road somewhere between genoa and nice or could be even farther from nice towards west , but i think most of what i have in mind was in italy . 
  only been there by bus , though . 
  i just remember nice view and numerous short tunnels . 
  hope you 're not expecting any snow . 
  that time of year it 's usually grey , foggy , likely rainy , melancholic . 
  but then it 's december and full of nice lights , etc. 
  so that 's something . 
  ( well , there is snow in the mountains . ), 
  i would n't recommend relying on public transport . 
  especially trains are old and slow , also do n't reach many places . 
  buses can be better , but you 're definitely better off renting a car , though you 're in trouble of finding/paying a parking spot . 
  i 'd recommend you a bohinj lake area , but that 's perhaps better for summer . 
  never been there in winter . 
  our food not my kind of food . 
  except [ potica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nut_roll ) ( well , that article is badly written , to be honest ; but the bottom picture - breakfast - is very real and very proper , except i only see two slices of proper potica ) , which must be walnut ( and walnut only ) and may include raisins ( it 's better with them imho ) .

  kosovo may have a regional parliament and its members can say whatever they like ( obviously they are serbians ) , but what does it matter if nobody listens to them , if * the very territory they are supposed to represent * has broken away and has clearly not voted for this parliament at all ? 
  ok , liberland has a population 8-10 . 
  my point stil stands . 
  the sovereign military order of malta has a tonne of citizens too , but it 's not a country . 
  as thick as two short planks !, 
  let 's not talk about sealand and molossia , let 's talk about abkhazia , south ossetia and transnistria . 
  territories whose population exceed 5 people . 
  real people live there , not by choice but by birth . 
  they function as countries . 
  they have parliaments , governments , their currencies and economies . 
  just like kosovo does . 
  the greatest sovereign state in the world ( russia ) recognises their independence from georgia/moldova and has in fact actively helped them to establish it . 
  do you still think they are just as credible as kosovo ? 
  even though they are only recognized by 5 or 6 states , as opposed to kosovo 's 114 ? 
  and given the fact that russia recognises them ? 
  still not enough recognitions to be credible . 
  the self-proclaimed `` republic of kosovo '' has so far received 114 diplomatic recognitions , which is more than half of the world 's 206 states ( numbers from wikipedia ) and amounts to a big claim to credibility . 
  are abkhazia , south ossetia and transnistria countries in your opinion ? 
  yes , but are liberland and sealand recognized by other countries ? 
  if they are not , why should their opinion matter ? 
  you see , it 's all relative , a chain , so to speak .

  you misspelt ` slovenia ' .

  then you have to order new documents and everything , it is quite costly . 
  obviously this only works for citizens ( and possibly residents ) , you ca n't just come here from poland and say `` please change my name '' .

  omg , how is that possible ? 
  the star of extremely subsidized french/european cinema does n't like high taxes . 
  oh , the irony . 
  not really . 
  the language of the new law is very vague , it brings nothing new to the table & everything will be really determined by the implementation of rules by the apek , slovenian telecommunications regulator , and the results of the eu consultation process . 
  absolutely nothing will change wtih the new law . 
  just a lot of pr-fog from totally incompetent & very unpopular super-ministry of \u017diga turk . 
  some definitely , but support for this in slovenia would probably be < 1 % . 
  except the gbp level , there would be no much of a difference . 
  it is almost hilarious , how similar slovenian and austrian ( political ) systems are ( corporativism , vested intests , corruption , ... ), 
  it 's a generational thing . 
  for example , as youngsters we watched tv zagreb regulary , at least in in eastern slovenia . 
  now not anymore . 
  the language differences are becoming a huge obstacle for younger generations . 
  and the eu can not provide for 0,1 % without falling apart . 
  great . 
  you can be sure we will if common european border/schengen policy falls apart because of lack of solidarity in current refugee situation . 
  look for your passport and visa application . 
  next step : close slovenian border for romanian emigrants . 
  nice & logical solution , i think . 
  lol eastern europe was cheering merkel in hard dealing of greece , now they are calling doom & gloom because they have to provide for refugees . 
  what a grotesque !, 
  they want open borders to uk , free emigration of their citizens to uk , germany ... they want schengen ... but only when all costs are paid by someone else ( greece , italy ) . 
  what a pathetic bunch of retards . 
  and they willingly participated in almost all war projects , that lead to current migrants influx . 
  coalition of the willing by rumsfeld . 
  common borders = common responsibilities . 
  at the height of wars in ex-yugoslavia , slovenia of 2 million people provided ( not perfectly , we are sorry ... ) for more than 60.000 refugees . 
  no society collapse ... some stayed , some moved forward , some returned to homeland after the wars . . and slovenia today is better because of them . 
  but a half of billion people from the richest part of the world can not provide for few hundred thousand people ? 
  fucktards . 
  pathetic . 
  vote me down as you like , but i can not stand this anti-refugees/migrants & right wing circlejerk at #europe anymore . 
  distressing . 
  unfollow . 
  lol u win at bullshitting in this thread hands down, 
  and it is a joke , deliberate humiliation by ultra conservative fucktards ala former minister drobni\u010d , that declared homosexuality a disease . 
  the eu demanded some protection and they delivered it ... and made sure it is degrading in every way possible to gay couples . 
  lol you know , that you are just adapting words of british racists about romanians ... to refugees ? 
  well done . 
  approx . 
  1,5 million people left romania in the last decade . 
  you know - economic migrants . 
  this is pathetic , really . 
  u want schengen , free movement to every eu member state ... 1,5 milion ppl emigrated from romania to western europe ... but when you should take people from one of the worst places on earth ... 
  the eu is not good anymore . 
  noted . 
   pathological altruism currently on display in berlin wrong . 
  they have very reasonable costs/benefits analysis with only one explosive variable : public opinion . 
  if they survive this , get ( sooner than later ) to the common eu framework , including quotas , germany will be better off in long-term - if they want to stay the leading ( most populous ) eu country . 
  if not , france and especially the uk are on a very good path to overtake them by 2055 . 
  do n't let the door hit you on the way out, 
  yes . 
  the difference is : the life partnership law has 82 articles . 
  slovenian has 10 that can be summarized : `` see the marriage law except in case of adoptions '' . 
  not full marriage equality yet ... we are still figuring out how to deal with approx . 
  20 % population that is quite homophobic . 
  not exactly . 
  slovenia had so called registered partnership law since 2005 that was similar to that croatia has atm . 
  some rights , but not all . 
  the new law is improvement in that regard that the rights are exactly the same , in all areas and in all connected legislation , 100 % . 
  the new law literally has provisions like `` the same as in the marriage law '' . 
  repeated over and over . 
  the main drawback is excluding of adoption by same-sex couples ( you can adopt as gay , but not together as a couple ) . 
  but slovenian courts recognize adoptions by same sex couples abroad . 
  we have people with birth certificates with two dads / mothers , and now you can finally have a big festive wedding , done by the mayor of your city . 
  only two thing left now are : domestic gay couple adoptions ( we already recognize those from abroad ) and elimination of different names for the same thing : marriage . 
  and automotive technology , probably . 
  it 's hard to buy an european car without at least some parts developed / produced here . 
  1.687,64 to be exact ( last published official data , november 2016 ) . 
  ehm ... data is a bit off . 
  $ 1,087 is net average salary in slovenia - after all taxes and deductions ( data in the graph above is not net . 
  average wage before taxes is around 1700 eur ) . 
   european single market membership does normally require the four freedoms .

   whose population is mostly muslim they are mostly albanian , that 's the big issue . 
  what do you call a woman who has never cleaned the snow ? 
  nikol ( i ) = never kidati = to clean snow, 
  slovenski zet - slovenian son-in-law !, 
  utopiti ( koga ) v \u017elici vode - to drown ( somebody ) in a spoon of water priti na zeleno vejo - to come onto a green tree-branch, 
   i feel no connection with macedonia and bulgaria . 
  i mean we shared a country with fyrom for 70 years but that 's about it . 
  there 's no cultural ties whatsoever . 
  and especially not with bulgaria . 
  i do n't think i 'd feel any cultural connection with bosnians , serbians and montenegrins either if it wasnt for their immigrants and therefore their popular media constantly present here . 
  going to bosnia feels a lot more foreign to me than going to czech r. for example . 
  i agree . 
  apart from linguistic connections , slovenians had nothing to do with other south slavs except in the period from 1918 to 1991 . 
  going to bosnia was an eye-opener . 
  felt like turkey or something , yet i understood everything . 
  we 've had euros for 10 years now . 
  sometimes people complain about how everything was cheaper in the time of [ tolars ] ( http://mayimbe.blog.siol.net/files/2010/05/tolarji-3.jpg ) but it 's just nostalgic nonsense in my opinion - they conveniently forget about inflation etc. 
  my grandma still talks about dinars sometimes ( the yugoslav currency ) . 
  she seemingly did n't notice tolars at all . 
  very understandable . 
  but then i am semi-fluent in polish , russian and croatian/serbian , so i do n't know how much of it i understand because of it . 
  clubs , dating , friends do n't have anything to do with the university - they are the social part of the student life , completely detached from any official university business . 
  everyone grows weary of the university , in my ( and lots of my friends ' ) experience . 
  when you finish , you 're just glad it 's over . 
  of course you are happy to have learnt so many things , but it 's * your * achievement , no need to glorify the institution ( and donate money to them ? 
  - this one had me like wtf ?? ), 
  the day you graduate is usually the day of your greatest relief because you wo n't have to set foot in that institution you 've come to hate , * ever again * . 
  well there is always a bunch of strange people , but they withdraw their candidatures sooner or later so they do n't actually appear on the ballot . 
  in that sense , you are right, 
  yeah , in slovenia , the crazy candidates are more prevalent at the presidential elections . 
  i ca n't recall any un-seriousness at the parliamentary level . 
  well of course , i mentioned these ijekavci later in my post , 
  i agree . 
  been to sarajevo , had tastebuds blown . 
  well , being a modern nomad is not a viable option in europe . 
  you will cross international borders all the time , have you thought about all the visas you will need ( especially thinking about russia here ) - bear in mind some countries will not let stateless people in for fear they will remain there - on top of that what about insurance , car registration , paying taxes , having a bank account , complying with immigration rules , dealing with different currencies ... you are very welcome to come to europe on normal terms , but you will have to pick a country and research your opportunities to immigrate legally . 
  where there 's a will , there 's a way . 
  but if you want to willingly pursue statelessness in order to somehow get around the rules , it will eventually backfire straight in your face . 
  do n't lose hope because of the political situation at the moment . 
  we all know it changes every so many years and it would be incredibly silly to put your life in jeopardy for this reason . 
  have you been to all of the us states ? 
  have you been to europe ? 
  i suggest you come here for a month and see how it 's * really * like . 
  similar here . 
  when someone says * burek * i think of the cheese one . 
  * mesni burek * is the one in the picture . 
   i want wide , open spaces to travel to . 
  i want to live in different places every so often . 
  the us seems a perfect place for both of these requirements ... 
  it 's a big mess , but yeah , it 's not that hard if you know where to look . 
  cyrillic script = definitely serbian latin script = can be any of them but : if you see a lot of `` je '' and `` ije '' combinations , then it 's croatian/bosnian , but if there is `` e '' in the same places , then it 's serbian . 
  serbian also prefers the `` da + present tense '' construction to the infinitive used in croatian/bosnian . 
  to distinguish croatian from bosnian you should look for turcisms and arabic words which mark bosnian , or for stupidly-sounding ultra-slavic neologisms which mark croatian . 
  montenegrin is a young thing ( officially existing since 2007 ) and it really came to the fore because of the country 's newly-gained independence . 
  they use `` je '' / `` ije '' as in croatia/bosnia , but also use the cyrillic script quite often . 
  serbian language used by serbs in bosnia also uses `` je '' / `` ije '' but is strictly cyrillic in script . 
  so if you have to distinguish montenegrin from serbian in bosnia , you look for the negative forms of the verb `` to be '' which are `` nijesam , nijesi '' etc. 
  in montenegrin , but `` nisam , nisi '' etc. 
  in all other concerned languages . 
  of course , all of this only applies to \u0160tokavian dialects . 
  in croatia , there are also \u010cakavian and kajkavian dialects which are basically another languages , with much much more differences from \u0160tokavian than all four `` official '' forms have amongst them . 
  when it comes to listening , i can easily distinguish serbian ( broad , laid-back , almost lazy-sounding ) from bosnian ( very melodic , strictly uses pitch accent and post-stress lengths ) from croatian ( somewhat neutral ) . 
  i am not sure about montenegrin because we do n't really have a lot of contact . 
  i guess you just have to pay attention to the `` nijesam '' forms mentioned above . 
  kajkavian croatian sounds almost the same as slovenian - very nice to listen to . 
  \u010cakavian is strange , but still recognisable . 
  this reply is really an overkill , is n't it ? 
  but here you go , since you asked ... , 
   cantonese , mandarin which are , in fact , two different languages and totally mutually unintelligible . 
  well of course it does . 
  the words are ancient cousins , 
  it certainly can be done , here is mike gogulski 's [ blog ] ( http://www.nostate.com ) - he did exactly what you are describing . 
  honestly though , please do n't get any ideas . 
  have you ever been outside the us ? 
  to me , hungarian sounds like robotic speech . 
  all the syllables seem to get an equal stress and it ends up in endless machine-gun like utterances . 
  it is also interesting how you do n't have a normal `` a '' sound . 
  your '' \u00e1 '' is far too much open whilst your `` a '' is far too much close . 
   ( i took hungarian class for half a year , was fun ), 
  username checks out :d, 
  oh yes , it 's everywhere . 
   kotimasten kielten keskus which of these words means finland ? 
  is n't it suomi ? 
  russian * \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0438\u043d * ( krest ` yanin ) = a peasant slovenian * kristjan * = a christian bulgarian * \u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442 * ( kmet ) = a mayor slovenian * kmet * = a peasant polish * podatek * = a tax slovenian * podatek * = a piece of data polish * dru\u017cyna * = a team slovenian * dru\u017eina * = a family, 
  when i first tried lapsang souchong , my first thought was `` it tastes like ri\u010det '' . 
  i would n't call greece eastern europe ... 
  a new definition of balkans to include [ brandenburg and saxony ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/sorben ) . 
   after voting , you get a stamp in your passport . 
  brilliant idea !, 
  does that mean everyone in latvia has passports ? 
  some may only have id cards ... 
  anyway , i suppose you do n't have constituencies or specific seats you 're voting for ( as in the uk for instance ) and the whole country just counts all the votes together ? 
  no wasted votes etc , seems like a very good system . 
  so the voting stations have some kind of a central system to check who has already voted ? 
  in slovenia , you get assigned to your local station ; however if you know you will be in some other place on the voting day , you can apply to vote in that other place . 
  but still they assign you a specific voting station in another place ( and this is a separate station for non-locals ) . 
  no , this is not the usa where you can move from kansas to vermont overnight ... moving to a different country involves looots of research , documentation , logistics etc. 
  and it probably takes at least 6 months of preparations . 
  therefore i think nobody chooses to move to another country just because the politics in any given month ( or year ) . 
  personally , i would never move to france , although i am fluent in french and know quite a lot about their culture and values .

  i assume most of us are ok with prioritising voice over ip and internet tv , but we 're probably against prioritising one website over another or any comperable services over each other because this would be an anticompetitive practice and therefore bad for us consumers there are shades of grey here , not just a simple dichotomy ... some prioritisation makes sense - just from the nature of the services ( see above ) i have no problem if they designate email protocols as low priority for example - it makes sense in fact . 
  i also want , ney demand , that my digital tv works smoothly ( do n't actually have it but if i did i would ) and if that means that my torrent only has 1mb/s dl while i 'm watching desperate housewives ( not really ) on demand , then so be it the important thing here is that i 'm clearly shown what the minimum guaranteed speeds are before i sign up ... and also that there 's no discrimination based on content ... same principle as the 3rd energy package imposed on pipelines -- a gas supplier ca n't own a pipeline directly and the actual owner has to make the pipeline available to all gas suppliers on an equal and competitive basis ... details, 
  they applied , the then members went unofficially through the roof , and they quietly withdrew the application, 
  his loyal opposition ? 
  ... no , but seriously :-), 
  ... if putin passed away quietly in his sleep tonight ? 
  linija :d, 
  you either love him or you hate him . 
  sometimes both at the same time . 
  no , wtf !, 
  as ever , the devil 's in the details here ... 
  i assume most of us are ok with prioritising voice over ip and internet tv , but we 're probably against prioritising one website over another or any comperable services over each other because this would be an anticompetitive practice and therefore bad for us consumers there are shades of grey here , not just a simple dichotomy ... some prioritisation makes sense - just from the nature of the services ( see above ), 
  i took this test once and it placed me below and to the left of alexis tsipras . 
  i do n't buy it - i 've always voted either center-left or center-center ( liberals ) . 
  so either this compass thing is wrong in some way or i 'm really confused : - s, 
  i bring [ potica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nut_roll ) , [ prekmurska gibanica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prekmurska_gibanica ) and [ krem\u0161nita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kremna_rezina ) . 
  there is a good chance that i could be engaging in wishful thinking just above ... then again , there are n't any numbers available so i get to lie to myself for the time being, 
  the funny ones start at # 4 and continue downward, 
  i remember the same thing ... 
  i could n't find anything very easily , but it may just have been a clever political leak . 
  edit : i think this article does a better job of describing the specifics : [ click ] ( http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/11/europe-lays-out-its-most-ambitious-reform-plan-yet-no-more-roaming-premiums-enforced-net-neutrality-and-more/ ), 
  i think you 're being entirely too pessimistic about the s&d showing and a bit too generous to the far-right . 
  i think s&d and the greens/efa will gain somewhat , but not enough to remove epp ( which will lose some seats ) as the plurality holder . 
  i defer to your judgment regarding alde . 
  there 's a comment under the article which points out the problem with online polls : they tend to get distorted by groups with a strong interest i do n't know what the sample size was here , but in case it was n't very large the result could be rendered completely useless by no more than a few people with an axe to grind, 
  the other half blows over to slovenia, 
  they 've been doing the same thing with [ ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine_and_the_eu#russian_reaction ) to little effect . 
  it did seem to work with [ armenia ] ( http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2013/09/04/eu-stunned-by-armenia-u-turn/ ) though . 
  since you 're starting in vienna , you may want to consider [ maribor ] ( http://tinyurl.com/nr3lafl ) and [ ljubljana ] ( http://tinyurl.com/qx57ex4 ) ( no need to change your money and most people speek english well enough ) . 
  great places to visit with plenty to see if you look into it , but in my opinion they 're best suited as places to take a vacation from you vacation . 
  not really made for the industrious tourist . 
  i may be wrong about that , 
  still waiting for you to admit that you were wrong on the original point . 
  till then i 'm not really interested in moving on to the next one, 
  you 're changing the subject ... that 's fine , but i 'd like to have my previous point acknowledged first, 
  no , just saw youtube videos from there ... sort of like in this case, 
  they actually do . 
  the difference is that they do n't get a vote on what those policies are . 
  switzerland to a lesser extent than norway , but even so . 
  the ... word ... is ... football !, 
  i do n't mean this in a derogatory way , but i like these sorts of protests so much more than the occupy type . 
  it 's clever . 
  it 's thoughtful . 
  there 's an argument for producing goods which are cheap and do n't last for long in those cases where technological advancement is rapid . 
  example : i have no interest in paying more for a computer so that it can last for 15 years instead of 5 . 
   the one giving so-called advice has over 50000 troops stationed on your territory it 's no coincidence that people prefer american troops to russian tourists . 
  history , even recent history , makes this an easy choice to make . 
  it 's an interesting academic idea which will never come close to implementation . 
   was n't mr schaeuble that said that greeks did n't vote wisely to be honest , i 'm surprised nobody 's said that about us yet . 
  slovenia and the netherlands have it , not the whole eu . 
  it seems to me that he builds his case on a number of assumptions which could be empirically substantiated , but he never attempts to do anything of the sort . 
  over and over , he makes testable assertions for which he provides no evidence . 
  i have little choice but to recollect the fact that ideas which are asserted without evidence , can also be dismissed without evidence . 
  so much for the foundation of the case . 
  the construction built on top of this foundation seems to be remarkably flimsy as well . 
  perhaps i 'm just not paying enough attention , but from where i 'm sitting , it seems that he spirals into complete gibberish several times . 
  on other occasions he just jumps from one partially made point to another while neglecting to provide any meaningful connections . 
  edit : on at least one occasion , he outright lies - stating that the german population is declining . 
  i upvoted this , but honestly , i do n't know why any more . 
  one of many off topic anti-ukraine comments made one day after a prominent russian oppositionist gets executed and you do n't see the relevance of them being written by a brand new accounts ? 
  there seem to be a lot of people doing that today . 
  interestingly enough , they all seem to have a pro-russian point to make . 
  would you like to explain how jewish europeans * act like a douche * ? 
  thank you for taking the time to translate this . 
  it 's one thing to have clickbait titles , but to do this stuff in the body of the article is essentially just lying . 
  i had the same thought , but maybe build it deep under the alps to mess with the kremlin while we 're at it . 
  i can see his soul . 
  can you see his soul ? 
  on second thought , that may just be a spider on my monitor . 
  my bad .

   i really hope this works and is n't one of those `` good on paper '' ideas . 
  morocco 's been doing this in the north african region for years - it 's not a newfangled idea . 
  it deserves to be defended and reinforced . 
  britain and france = / = eu, 
  the eu has take no action on syria save for the arms embargo and the delivery of humanitarian aid . 
  let 's be precise here please . 
  because they 're demolishing schengen one border at a time . 
  coming soon - to a town near you !, 
  who cares what it 's called . 
  the important thing is that europe 's interests are protected ( edit  and it 's security . 
  [ let 's hope they last the night . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/gxc-jjhfaui ), 
  it 's called a quarantine . 
  european values belong in europe and to it . 
  we would n't want to be cultural imperialists or anything like that . 
  i 's worth a shot . 
  they have [ minefields . 
  ] ( http://envsec.grid.unep.ch/see/maps/landmines.jpg ) does that help ? 
  i agree . 
  i mostly put this here to show what the kremlin narrative is regarding this issue . 
  the fact is that all the border security measures so far are well in line with what schengen allows in special situations . 
  it does look really bad , though . 
  nope . 
  takes them from italy , greece and hungary . 
  the strange thing is that hungary is rejecting a quota system which would relocate a large number of the people currently in the country . 
  what gives ?

  the russians knew that the austrians knew that fact . 
  and yet , austria proceeded to make demands that included military presence in serbia , something that was obviously there for the serbs to reject . 
  so , you know that your adversary knows that what they 're doing means they 'll have to deal with you eventually , yet they 're acting as if that 's the least of their concerns . 
  both of you also know that if you come to blows , it 's going to be bad for you both . 
  so , when they start acting as if they 're not worried , you know that someone has their back . 
  the `` someone '' in this case being germany . 
  and you go `` fuck , the germans are up to something '' , and mobilize in advance . 
  of course there 's also the fact that wilhelm ii was out on a cruise when he really should have been in berlin , keeping on top of the situation . 
  i do n't think we should forget about those . 
  bribery is bribery , `` someone else happened to offer more than we did '' is n't a defense . 
  yup stealing that quote , too , if situation calls for it ... 
  well , you have to hand it to them , tho , they named their main airport after that guy , as opposed to some politician . 
  inb4 erdogan goes `` see !, 
  how could we have armenians in our parliament had we exterminated them ! '', 
  is my mom ugly , too ? 
  germany was gave austria a blank check to deal with serbia as they see fit , the austrians interpreted that in their own way , made demands that were designed to be refused ( military control ) , and by the time wilhelm was back from his vacation that he could n't have picked at a worse time , and sent that telegram , austria had already declared . 
  well , i will concede that while wilhelm ii was n't innocent , it was mostly his incompetence that helped start the mess - there 's a crisis in the sphere of influence of the central powers , and what does he do ? 
  * he goes on a fucking cruise !, 
  * plus , if bismarck is to be believed , wilhelm very much did want a war with russia , just not at the same time as with france . 
  yeah , pretty much . 
  yeah , germany totally was n't up to anything then ... totally not . 
  ... it 's the internet . 
  some people are just assholes . 
  that 's all . 
  there 's an xkcd for it : https://xkcd.com/1510/, 
  `` if you do stuff that likely increases your medical costs you should pay more for insurance '' is what you said . 
  not only smoking and drinking , but also commuting , extreme mountaineering and being married to a control freak do . 
  so , people spending a lot of time commuting should be paying more than those who do n't , then ? 
  after all , commuting increases risk of injury and thus the risk that you 're going to be a drain on the healthcare system ... 
  yep , lots of trouble , ca n't afford any . 
  democratization comes internally . 
  the society , the people have to want it . 
  otherwise they 'll just replace an `` oppressive tyrant '' with `` the kind of tyrant we like and support , and fuck those who happen to not like this one '' . 
  the gulf of trieste , occupation during ww2 , the border concessions they got at the end of ww1 , i suppose . 
  also for driving badly and clogging our roads in the summer . 
  wait , is n't outstanding dues one of the first things that people check when you want to change your name , the other being outstanding criminal records ? 
  that 's good to hear . 
  always good when people can get over politics . 
  folks from other former ex-yugo republics still get a lot of hate . 
  people like to bash americans and germans too ... until they deal with an american or german , that 's where they switch to `` let 's drool around and suck up to the rich western foreigner , maybe he 'll notice us . '', 
  but the most hated nationality in slovenia seems to be slovenian , really ... 
  well at least there does n't seem to be a turbulent priest among them . 
  why did i get the mental image of cartman going `` respect my suvrenitah ! '', 
  then again , sovereignty can be iffy business , it 's like immunity for political honchos , most of those invoking it are sketchy . 
  i must admit i do n't . 
  well , carrying acid on you kind of makes it obvious it was premeditated ... 
  not sure that would be a good idea . 
  so we really want to give tsipras a reason to say `` look , they 're not even taking my calls , obviously they do n't want to * negotiate * , they just want to * force their terms * . '', 
  i 'm not sure it would be a good thing if there were nukes in ukraine right now , and especially not a good thing a year or so ago when yantsenyuk and tymoshenko were in `` raaaar !, 
  kill all russians ! '', 
  mode . 
  in the end you still need the electorate on your side to a significant degree to have any hope of projecting your political power . 
  especially in case of a power vacuum . 
  that too . 
  i think john oliver made the best joke on greece . 
  `` greece , a country of , and in , ruins . '', 
  i mean , if only greeks get on his nerves , he 's a better man than me . 
  * everyone * gets on my nerves . 
  so wait , * are * we afraid of russia , or are we not afraid of russia ? 
  i know i 'm not actually afraid , just really really annoyed . 
  one cup of `` common sense '' . 
  i mean , you have to be beyond insane to order `` hey guys , shoot down that civilian flight for me , will ya ? '', 
  this is true . 
  but the entire mess is actually egg on their face , and they might want to clean it up . 
  that 's actually very much how realpolitik works . 
  you just need to push the right buttons . 
  you know ; victory through compromise - compromise the other guy to win . 
  depends . 
  this might blow your mind , but russians are n't cartoon villains who want to destroy the world . 
  they very much do like to trade to keep their economy going , and are willing to compromise on that . 
  he 's not given the order . 
  so yes , he 's responsible , but he 's no more guilty on this particular case than bush was guilty for the abu ghraib abuses and the like . 
  ... seriously , if putin is `` all that is wrong with this world '' ; the solution is rather simple . 
  but you and me both know that 's not the case ... do n't we . 
  and here i thought we were special :(, 
  that was just overeager autocorrect on the requisition order . 
  i 'm sure what was typed in was `` boomsticks '' . 
  but , well , autocorrect ... 
  really ? 
  you seriously think that isis considers russia to be any different than germany , poland , or usa ? 
  as far as isis is concerned , russia is part of the filthy heathen west . 
  i like the bear . 
  it 's great . 
  well , i 'm sure that 's true . 
  it 'd be a surprise if it was n't , especially seeing as they seem to be trying to move on mariupol ... 
  a finnish and a russian person agreeing on something !, 
  since everyone but slovakia chipped in on this one , you 're talking out of your rear end , methinks . 
  our prime minister and finance minister complained about the same thing . 
  politically , the relations are decent . 
  but there 's a lot of prejudice against people coming from those republics . 
  when it comes to the wars , yeah slovenia is rarely mentioned because we got out of in 10 days , very cleanly . 
  to me it actually looks more like japan than ussr . 
  we mess this up , we 're going to get a lovely `` lost decade '' or two of our own ... 
  at least it 's not a reality show ... wait i should stop giving them ideas . 
  i agree with this marketplace fellow . 
  it has to happen eventually , since the current state of the eu is quite unstable both politically and economically . 
  but there 's a lack of political will to do this . 
  and there will be a lack of political will to do this until some sort of a common `` european '' identity is built among the people . 
  we 're only decent because we 're too busy stabbing each other in the back to cause any kind of international issue  . <, 
  good luck suing it out of them .

  i do n't know , over here we have laws against harassing or mistreating people just because they happen to come from a specific country . 
  but okay , this is n't exactly beating someone up for being russian , but still ... now , i get it if she was putin 's girlfriend , or something ... i 'd get that . 
  but this is just lashing out at someone because you happen to hate what the government of the country they 're a citizen of is doing . 
  poor form . 
  not that i 'm saying that just being a bit of an inconsiderate asshole is a crime , i 'm just saying you would n't be on my party list . 
  everything is political these days it seems . 
  not that much , latvia performed quite strongly ... 
  one thing i do n't get is how czech republic gave 12 points to azerbaijan . 
  i think that was the only 12 point vote that actually surprised me . 
  and you think this will change their minds ? 
  that they will suddenly go `` oh my !, 
  how wrong have i been ! '', 
  or something ? 
  it 's like you laugh at and pat at a kid cause they did something cute and funny or useful , and it * was * cute and funny or useful the first , and maybe even the second time , but now * they just keep doing it instead of quitting while they were still ahead * . 
  i 'd argue that even this is nothing new . 
  russia 's military doctrine has considered the soldiers `` disposable '' for quite a long time before the current mess started . 
  this does n't bring anything new to the table . 
  everyone 's made up their mind about the ukraine situation months ago and sure as hell wo n't change it . 
  honestly , anyone who expects people to go `` forsooth !, 
  lo , have i been wrong and deceived ! '', 
  and suddenly change their mind about the entire thing , is kind of expecting the impossible . 
  those of us who are pretty damn sure russian soldiers were directly involved do n't * need * anything more , those who denied it will keep denying it , the only relevance this has is if someone wants to go sue russia in an international court or something . 
  so yeah , it 's basically been beaten past the point of it being a `` dead horse '' , now there are just some broken bones and a smear of blood on the ground where the horse fell down . 
  the usa is putting enough pressure on the eu when it comes to economic and market policies as it is . 
   russia has n't taken parts of eastern ukraine yet . 
  personally , i think that 's because the current situation suits them better ... the donbass area being a complete clusterfuck is currently still an ukrainian sovereign problem . 
  if russia annexes it , then it suddenly becomes * their * sovereign problem . 
  and russia really ca n't afford to have such a tumultuous region within the country . 
  i 'm with you on the rest , i 'm more annoyed than afraid myself . 
  i love how headlines love to use the word `` force '' . 
  it packs so much more punch than say , `` propose legislation for '' . 
  outdated , slovenia has legally recognized gay marriage . 
  greece might have something to say on the matter ... and i do n't blame 'em . 
  haha , i think you 've hit the nail on the head there . 
  nope , not scared . 
  to be honest , i 'm more worried about islamic state . 
  why did one russian guy kill the other russian guy ? 
  he got fed up with the old jokes the other guy was telling . 
  `` on vacation '' ? 
  if only . 
  putin was most definitely still working very hard then ( lots of strings to pull and stuff ) , and not taking a vacation . 
  that is * not * a `` bitchslap '' . 
  at worst , it 's an `` oh , you '' kind of slap . 
  we have a saying here , `` better an alive coward than a dead hero '' . 
  easy way to solve that . 
  ask them what a burqa is and see how many of them describe a hijab instead . 
  seriously , if we 're limiting songwriting or any other form of entertainment and art to `` reality '' , we might as well do away with the entire concept of art and creativity . 
  on the other hand , i somehow suspect you would have no problem if her song was about aliens abducting cows in kamchatka ( which would also be completely going against the reality of what 's happening in russia ) . 
  shooting down a commercial flight would n't look good on ukraine now would it . 
  thing is , macedonia is surounded by nato countries except for serbia and kosovo . 
  and those two would promptly get nipped in the bud if they looked funny at macedonia . 
  or russia opens a commercial airline from moscow to transnistria ... just to deliver vodka and potatoes to the people of transnistria , honest . 
  i agree with this 100 % . 
  not being gay myself , yet i can think of one or two situations where i 'd end up in a same-sex marriage ( citizenship , budget , etc. ), 
  i 'd know , i am one . 
  12 points , just for the hussar wings . 
  well , i 'm lazy therefore i only accept proofs presented in latin script and google translate just is n't reliable :( not saying i 'm asking for any `` proofs '' , mind ... i do n't really care much either way . 
  i mean , i do n't need additional `` proofs '' that russia is directly involved in ukraine , and that the donbass region is a complete clusterfuck . 
  i think it 's more `` i ca n't read cyrillic '' . 
  i do n't know , should over 50 's be entitled to eating food that tastes good ? 
  or watching anything other than soap operas ? 
  what kind of a dumb question is that . 
  slovenia , catering to headphone fetish folks since 2015 !, 
  infertile people ca n't reproduce even in principle either , yet you 've given no reason for why you 're considering them differently . 
  it 's not obfuscation , it 's a fact . 
  and that 's exactly the problem with what you 're saying . 
  1 ) `` ca n't have children = no marriage for them ! '', 
  2 ) `` infertile people ( who ca n't have children ) can get married '' . 
  there 's an inconsistency , right there . 
  now please . 
  continue squirming and weasel-wording . 
  make a fool of yourself some more , i beg you . 
  i 'm going to have so much fun . 
  that , or you can simply admit that `` marriage '' has nothing whatsoever to do with `` children '' , and find a different reason for why you would n't allow same-sex marriage . 
   it is reasoned logic and the fact that you ca n't respond without obfuscation shows that i am correct . 
  oh quit it with cheap and overused rhetorical nonsense . 
  you know as well as i do that this is bullshit , you might want to repeat the above 300 times in front of a mirror , and you 'll still know it 's bullshit . 
  i asked a question within one particular social policy you were talking about . 
  i also did n't talk about undoing the social policy entirely , i asked about adjusting it to be in line with your claims . 
  remember , you 're the one who came forth with an absolute statement that `` ca n't have children , therefore no marriage for them '' . 
  all i did was point out the fact * that you 're already making exceptions . 
  and if you control the supply and the demand , you 're still controlling the prices . 
  indirect control is still control . 
  that 's what a free market has to do with informed purchases . 
  damn , i should almost challenge you to a goof-off . 
  but i 'm , too busy :(, 
  well , he * is * a politician ... * and * an economist . 
  from the article , it appears that the german government decided to do so of their own accord . 
  it 's not taking the blame , either , it 's just cleaning up a mess someone else left . 
  i mean , if i see a banana peel on the ground , and pick it up and take it to the trash , i did n't `` take the blame '' for the peel being there . 
  i just took care of an eyesore . 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  we are after all , armed with the power of hindsight , something the folks drafting that agreement did n't have . 
  not saying that they could n't have thought of something better , but we now have information they did not have ; what you said seems common sense to us because we know more than they did . 
  not mere `` manipulation '' , but `` deliberate manipulation '' . 
  do n't ask me to define half of an expression i used , especially not if it changes its meaning as a separate expression . 
  a teacher 's job is to pass on knowledge and information , it 's a neutral action . 
  parents as they bring up the kids are passing on things to them that should make their lives less of a hassle . 
  no such `` manipulation '' makes you an object to them , and it is n't as `` deliberate '' as it is just inherent in human interaction . 
  when advertisers throw deodorant ads at me , though , they 're trying to deliberately get me to buy something by subliminally telling me how much more i 'll be getting laid if i buy it , and their goal is simply profit - i 'm an object to them , a cash cow .

  true , the article says how big the russian muslim population is , but i 'm pretty sure the vast majority have been settled in and muslim for centuries .

  abstract of the paper in the lancet on emergence of the plasmid in question from 18th nov 2015 - http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/piis1473-3099 ( 15 ) 00424-7 / abstract :  ** polymyxin resistance ** was shown to be singularly due to the ** plasmid-mediated mcr-1 gene ** . 
  the plasmid carrying mcr-1 was ** mobilised ** to an e coli recipient at a frequency of 10 \u2212 1 to 10 \u2212 3 cells per recipient cell ** by conjugation ** , and maintained in * k pneumoniae * and * pseudomonas aeruginosa * . 
  in an in-vivo model , production of mcr-1 ** negated the efficacy of colistin ** . 
  [ article on the chinese report in science daily ] ( http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/11/151119095828.htm ) :  the polymyxins ( colistin and polymyxin b ) were the last class of antibiotics in which resistance was incapable of spreading from cell to cell . 
  until now , colistin resistance resulted from chromosomal mutations , making the resistance mechanism unstable and incapable of spreading to other bacteria , '' explains author professor jian-hua liu  because of the relatively low proportion of positive samples taken from humans compared with animals , it is ** likely ** that mcr-1 mediated colistin ** resistance originated in animals and subsequently spread to humans ** [ ... ] the ** selective pressure ** imposed by ** increasingly heavy use of colistin in agriculture ** in china could have led to the acquisition of mcr-1 by e. coli . 
   ** china ** is one of the world 's largest users and producers of ** colistin for agriculture and veterinary use ** . 
  ** worldwide ** , the demand for colistin in agriculture is expected to reach ** almost 12000 tonnes per year ** by the end of 2015 , rising to 16500 tonnes by 2021 . 
  it appears china uses colistin in feed additives .

  results show that mcr-1 was found in ** one patient ** , who suffered from a ** blood infection in 2015 ** and in ** five food samples ** that have been ** imported from 2012-2014 ** . 
  all the bacteria are multiresistant esbl bacteria containing the mcr-1 gene , which can further complicate treatment .

  i sincerely do n't know how stoping someone from crossing your borders without id became outrageous in the first place ... 
  from the article :  on wednesday , more than 1,000 migrants were stuck on the greek-macedonian border as guards there used racial profiling to determine who should and should not be allowed to cross the border to make their way north . 
  only syrians who could prove their nationality were allowed through . 
  nearly a dozen iranian refugees sewed their mouths shut in a form of protest . 
  wait , what ? 
  yes . 
  headscarfs are banned in public hospitals for the employees . 
  that 's very reasonable since display of religious symbols is generally frowned upon in health care .

  and if you 're a part of an absorbed group and do n't agree with that they have to say ? 
  you 're just a poor deluded oppressed fool in need of enlightenment .

  the number of migrants that have gone through slovenia is now greater than 10 % of our population . 
  i 'm not talking about colds , or feeling a bit down and the like . 
  placebo is powerful when it comes to symptoms of the disease which are modulated by the patients perception - pain , tiredness , ability to concentrate , motivation - and yes this things are very important for the general well-being of a person . 
  i 'm not disputing the effect of placebo on symptoms a patient experiences , hence the * feel * part . 
  but you do n't need to legitimize a pseudo-science field for that . 
  you can tell them to get some vitamin c an lemons for the tea , even tough several studies show the effect is minimal [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15495002 ) [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23440782 ) [ [ wiki ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vitamin_c_and_the_common_cold ) , here you can have a look at a [ plethora of remedies ] ( http://www.aafp.org/afp/2012/0715/p153.html ) that people believe in and some studies on them . 
  however quite a few studies show that while patients * feel * better , the actually clinical significance is often minimal : [ [ 3 ] ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19145994 ) the effects of hot drinks on nasal airflow , [ [ 4 ] ] ( http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/95/1/19.full ) placebo effect in oncology - interestingly while some patients had increased appetite there was no significant weight gain , [ [ 5 ] ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4351653/ ) placebo effect in asthma :  [ ... ] while most studies have repeatedly shown improvements in subjective measures of disease control , results are conflicting with regard to objective measures . 
  there has been an abundance of research into the placebo effect on objective and subjective measures of asthma . 
  [ ... ] anyway i 'm not saying placebo is useless , it can comfort patients and grant them a better sense of symptom control however it can not supplant regular treatments . 
  homeopathy is expensive water in small bottles , bringing it into a gps office gives it the legitimacy of an aspirin which imho is very troubling . 
  look up some studies on non-compliance . 
  it 's difficult to know why exactly the patients do n't take their medication , but it is a serious issue . 
  and this is anecdotal , but every now and then you get stories of patients [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://whatstheharm.net/homeopathy.html/ ) [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://www.news.com.au/national/aidan-fenton-7-vomited-and-died-after-slapping-therapy/story-fncynjr2-1227329512272 ) [ [ 3 ] ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/national/dead-babys-parents-ignored-advice-qc-20090504-asmt.html ) dying because of homeopathy and other alternative methods . 
  the thing to keep in mind is : `` it used to be that anything could be called a cure , then we tested it and the stuff that works became medicine . '' there is a whole class of drugs , where the exact mechanism of how it works is n't completely understood , yet we use them because research supports their effects . 
  nope . 
  there are placebo pills , come packaged like any other medicine and the doctor can prescribe it . 
  or you can prescribe vitamins or some such . 
  i 've seen it , but it 's still good for a laugh . 
  let me share one of my favorite stand-ups in return : [ dara o'briain : science does n't know everything ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udyba0m6zte ), 
  the placebo effect only makes you * feel * better , it does not in any way * make * you better . 
  the problem is that the patient believes he is being treated and getting better , which might lead to chronic complications due to non-compliance . 
  there are even cases ( anecdotal ) when patients stopped taking their regular medication because they believed they can sustain their health on alternative methods . 
  true , but you 're on * very * shaky ethical ground if you 'd try to advocate charging patients more for a more effective placebo .

  it gets even worse when you know the technical/engineering/science field involved .

  there was time for consumers to catch up with developments . 
  that may not be the case here . 
  finally , we should remember that things did n't just work out by themselves in the past . 
  reforms were introduced which reduced the labor pool - child labor prohibitions , retirement , the weekend , a limited working time , etc. 
  just like the human body is adapted to get the most out of every calorie , market is great at allocating scarce resources . 
  but what happens when the available food exceeds what you need ? 
  what happens when the labor force is in structural oversupply ? 
  especially in places like power plants . 
  i take it you do n't approve of this development . 
  if the problems this causes stopped at the russian border , i 'd still say it 's wrong as a matter of principle , but not really any of my business . 
  the crucial point is that those problems have now spilled across the russian border several times in rather dramatic fashino - that makes it our business . 
  is there some reason they do n't just import fuel from one of the half dozen countries with open borders with france ? 
  europe and the world remain heavily influenced by greek filosophy , roman law and the mythology of both even though there are n't any ancient greeks or romans left . 
  so , you know ... some sort of point ... 
  i wish you were right , but i 'm afraid you may not be . 
  this is the same sort of argument we 've been hearing about trump for a year now , and he 's beaten everyone in his path so far . 
  fatalism , really . 
  i would vote for the party that has reasonable policies on all issues , including migration from the third world . 
  right now , most of the centrist parties across europe either do n't have it or have it , but hide it . 
  i do n't like pessimism . 
  it 's seldom helpful . 
  austria just came within 1 % of what you say is impossible . 
  and that was with a relatively light migration burden compared to what we 're likely to see in the future . 
  a few years ago it seemed silly that the fn candidate would be a finalist in a presidential election , now , it 's all but certain . 
  thinking this could n't happen in shiny western europe is foolish and dangerous . 
  and that would be a bad thing . 
  the mainstream parties need to bend here - for the good of all of us . 
  weather or not you think i have the right , that 's the way the votes will go . 
  if the mainstream parties do n't do what 's necessary to satisfy their constituents , the far right will do a lot more . 
  if that happens , it 'll be bad for everyone . 
  thank goodness . 
  i really have nothing but gut wrenching disgust for the fp\u00d6 . 
  having said this , the reasonable parties across europe need to take note and build an effective mechanism for controlling migration and regulating it on our terms . 
  even if syria calms down , climate disruption wo n't . 
  and we ca n't be on the hook for all the people displaced by that over the next century + . 
  thank god . 
  will a large minority matter if leave wins ? 
  yea , that was stupid . 
  what are you basing that on ? 
  or , deny his party victory in the next election . 
  you know , like in every other parliamentary system . 
  about furthering the interests of its member states over the interests of third states . 
  seems fair to me . 
  we 're also former austrians . 
  i ca n't speak for the rest , but slovenia is nowhere near the balkans . 
   we 're one of the richest countries in the world . 
  as are qatar , brunei , kuwait and the uae . 
  must be because they did n't join the eu either . 
  by what measure , your gut ? 
  there 's no such thing as a recession if not for its technical definition . 
  the problem with your argument is that words have meaning . 
  you do n't know what a recession is , do you ? 
  learn english , dammit !, 
  the first major recession has been over for quite a while now , so ... 
  +5 food inflation, 
  this is long overdue . 
  was there a good reason for keeping europol out of it to begin with ? 
  i mean it was established specifically to deal with cross border organised criminality . 
  how was terrorism not part of that from the start ? 
  for some reason , reddit did n't tell me . 
  let 's resolve that you were wrong on the first point before we move on to your second example of sloppy thinking . 
  how familiar are you with events between 476 and 1945 ? 
  gmo safety is a case by case issue . 
  there 's also the matter of the precationary principle . 
  which has to be proven , harm or safety ? 
  to what level of confidence ? 
  this would be a big win for non-corporate trade marks . 
  yay !, 
  it adds freude . 
  how short is your memory ? 
  had russia refrained from occupying half of our continent , there would n't have been a nato in the first place . 
  [ r\u00e9alisations concr\u00e8tes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:schuman_declaration.ogg ), 
  it 's more in aggregate , sure . 
  but the thing is , it 's not actually aggregated , is it ? 
  it 's spread over a larger population . 
  country c with a population of 500 , a base nominal gdp of 1000 units , and growth of 7 % means the gdp grew by 70 units total or 0,14 units per person . 
  country e with a population of 200 , a base nominal gdp of 2000 units , and growth of 1,4 % means gdp grew by 28 units total or 0,14 per person . 
  per capita ppp nominal gdp growth combined with inflation rates is what matters to people 's standard of living . 
  in europe , the figures are given by quarter ( three months ) . 
  in the us , they take that figure and multiply it by 4 to show what it would mean for the whole year if it stayed constant . 
  was he really ? 
  that would be hysterical !, 
  it 's good because , in the past , religiois practices would be given an unjustified exemption from this kind of reasonable thinking . 
  i guess even putin does something good twice a day - or whatever . 
  legion of dumb , assemble !, 
  the inflation rate in the eurozone is negligible and has been for a long time . 
  the take-away : slovenia is not of balkan !,

  not to give you any ideas , but you could probably invade us in an afternoon . 
  i have also heard of the onion packs . 
  also sliced potatoes on your feet while you 're sleeping to get rid of a fever . 
  lol . 
  officially not much . 
  homeopathy has just recently been officially decriminalized . 
  before , a doctor could lose a licence . 
  people widely use herbs in forms of tea though . 
  we have a saying `` za vsako bol , travca raste '' which means - for every sickness there 's a ` grass ' ( herb ) . 
  honey is also very important . 
  chiropractics are used , so are other kinds of healers , easpecially bioenergetics . 
  there 's tons of ` energy points ' around the country . 
  and some people actually believe this things help . 
  years ago , i remember there was this thing on tv about sleeping in a cave , probably connected with bioenergy , but i 'm not sure . 
  there 's [ this russian healer guy ] ( http://www.maksimosipov.com/en/ ) who 's supposed to be one of the best healers in the world that works here . 
  i remember when my uncle had a cancer , they tried every available alternative medicine option . 
  they planterd tons of aronia and visited many bioenergetics . 
  my mom also believes in a ` tapping technique ' : / . 
  she goes to some meetings like once a year and supposedly there 's quite a few people there . 
  but i have never seen her use it .

  what ? 
  theres tooooooooons of space between a joke and an insult . 
  it was just a bimbo statement . 
  there was nothing joke like about it and you know it . 
  sure , they would n't say it 's cruel to give that name to a child though . 
  that 's not how you use sarcasm ... 
  really ??? 
  if lulika was a name in norwegian , i would n't go and say that 's a cruel name to give to a child just because it has a weird name in slovene . 
  that 's just stupid . 
  gaber is n't funny either because i had no idea a similar word in serbo-croatian has a weird meaning . 
  gabor , a hungarian name still is n't funny now that i know it means ` an ugly person ' .

  what is a prison gang ? 
  i do n't see how saying ` xx is a cruel name to give to a kid ' is a joke . 
  but what do i know . 
  especially since it 's a pretty normal name here without any sort of a bad meaning . 
  i 'd understand if a name in question was tit or something completely weird , like severina . 
  you almost ca n't run out of pretty french towns . 
  and ... people are supposed to become botanist before giving names to their kids or what ? 
  hornbeam is also hardwood , also known as ironwood . 
  everything is possible with you people . 
  no , my name starts with 's ' . 
  you have so many prettier towns than that . 
  we speak slovene , not croatian . 
  no one even thinks of what a name sounds in croatian . 
  it 's pretty idiotic to look at foreign names like that . 
  better run to that finnish family about to name their daughter rauha , because it sounds similar to raufnk which means chimney . 
  because jasen is such a special tree . 
  not to mention ru\u017ea . 
  sounds like `` ru\u017ean '' . 
  yea because people consider what their names sound like in some random language ... 
  your name probably sounds like ` butthole ' in some random african language . 
  how terrible !, 
  why would that be cruel ? 
  it 's a tree . 
  yep .

  18-22 , sunny , with slight wind . 
  preferably with a 90 % humidity ? 
  personal stuff is for after school . 
  we have civic education in ethics class though which mentions multiple religions . 
  i experienced quite a few in japan . 
  the worst one was 6 . something . 
  no one even budged . 
  and i was like o_o ok . 
  i have n't been there at night , but during the day it seems ok . 
  very peaceful with lots of young families . 
  i was a bit apprehensive going there for the first time but it was n't any different than any other neighbourhood . 
  i was a kid back then so i can only speak from a child 's perspective . 
  it was great . 
  absolutely great . 
  my parents managed to buy an apartment in the city , buy an old house with quite a bit of property , tear it down and build a new one which we used as a weekend house . 
  i spent every weekend there , at my cousins or at my grandmas . 
  my grandma had 2 cows and barn cats . 
  she sometimes had little calves and i would spend my days with them laying in hay . 
  we went camping to novigrad in croatia every year and skiing a lot . 
  every now and then i went on holidays to ba\u0161ka in croatia for 2 weeks which was organised by the city i lived in . 
  you did have to pay , but it was cheap because the city has a house thingy there . 
  i also had some health issues i so went there for free twice . 
  there 's a lake near my city , around 7km from where i live and me and my friends would rollerblade or cycle there almost every day in the summer . 
  even though there were no mobile phones , parents did n't worry . 
  other days we went to the pool . 
  mcdonalds was a place to celebrate birthdays in . 
  but i wanted to be different so i celebraited in dairy queen . 
  i also remember watchig a lot of mtv and german viva . 
  and buying bravo magazine . 
  my first concert was the kelly family in 1998 . 
  as a kid i was n't really aware of the scale of a war going on so close to us . 
  we had quite a few bosnian refugees come to our kindergarten and later school and i 'm stil friends with a few of them . 
  as u/pp86 already mentioned , we got shares . 
  my parents let me decide which ones i wanted ( stupid ! ),

  did n't lose the child . 
  she did it later , i do n't know how . 
  this thread is full of men judging women and being against abortion . 
  it would be a lot different if men could be pregnant . 
  we praise soldiers who kill people who already live and are loved by their family and friends . 
  but hey , it 's the biggest sin if a woman has an abortion . 
  fetus is not even a person in her womb , but it 's a murder . 
  actually nowdays abortions are n't that terrible , especially in the first weeks . 
  they give you a pill , you bleed ( like a period ) and that 's it . 
  you go to a check up in a week or two . 
  a lot of companies wo n't hire ( young ) women because they will have children and go to maternity leave . 
  also taking days off because your child is sick . 
   and it was never between the people but mostly due to political games . 
  i did n't say between people . 
  the post i was reffering to was more about politics . 
  what about recent history ? 
  borders , letting refugees into the country , etc. 
  and domobranci and ustasa being friends is n't something to be proud off . 
   because razor-wire strikes chords of our cold war with russia to me , and is n't something you roll out near people you care about . 
  i know refugees/immigration is a huge deal right now , but razor wire is another level entirely , and absolutely has to bring back images of at the very least , ww2 scenes to european nations . 
  austria started building fence on the border with slovenia too . 
  croatia and slovenia never were besties . 
  fence did n't damage our relationship . 
  ** severina ** of course . 
  and other yugo bands/singers ( plavi orkestar , parni valjak , lete\u010di odred , etc ) others : indila la oreja de van gogh alizee shy 'm,

  this is n't a map of ` applied for asylum ' ... there is a chart yes , but also number of illegal crossings .

  when hungary closed borders we had 250 000 migrants in a month ( or even more ) . 
   slovenia - german ordnung , but much more friendly people .

  you might offer it to the guest , but its ' more like it to keep it and eat it later ( alone , with your family or one of the members of your family will eat it ),

  i traveled to spain alone when i was 17 . 
  did not have any written persmission . 
  no one asked me anything . 
  not in vienna , not in madrid . 
   i always wondered , does she get 72 virgins ? 
  i honetly do n't know what is this obession with virginity ? 
  getting 72 virgins probably does n't result in great , fun , exciting sex . 
  maybe they should wish for 72 porn stars :p, 
   how can a 15 yo cross borders with a legal guardian ? 
  wtf !? 
  you can . 
  i was 16 when i went alone to uk and 17 when i went to spain . 
  by plane . 
  no one asked questions . 
  i also looked younger than my age . 
  each country has an army . 
  i do n't think the key here are her sex skills , but more her assx4, 
   yes , because the germans desperately need their slovenian friends , whatever would they do without them we need them . 
  whose economy is better croatian 's or germany 's ? 
  also croatians have been mean to us since 1991 . 
  they were letting refugees across the border in non-organized way through fields and rivers in the middle of the night . 
   us slovenians are cutting off our only historical allies . 
  during the second world war we were the only country in europe with three occupation regimes - the italians , the austro-germans , the hungarians !, 
  if it were n't for the slovene , serbian , bosnian and croatian partisans , your grandparents would end up in a fucking chimney !, 
  allies change over time . 
  just like people do or friendships . 
  just go to any porn site and search for kardashian .

  i think this is becoming a thing in europe too . 
  where do you live that do n't charge you that ? 
  they usually do , if the atm is not from the bank you are a client . 
   owning a car . 
  in most eu countries it is unusual to have your own car until you 're with kids ; before then if you need your car your work will either lease you one or pay you extra for your car expenses . 
  you wo n't use your car too much for personal stuff . 
  i would n't agree with this . 
  people usually get their own car when they turn 18 or 19 , except if you live in the city center . 
   kardashians everyone watched kim 's porno . 
  also young women follow them on instagram . 
  otherwise , not really . 
  it 's frustrating how many people ( on twitter ) in slovenia thinks the fence is un-neccesary . 
  that there is no saftey risk with so many refugees ( because all of them are nice people , families ) and if you say that there are saftey concerns ( terrorism ) , they say you a nazi , far-right . 
  slovenia is the monster here according to them . 
  um ... as a woman i think this photo may be photoshopped . 
  because who ( except maybe porn star on the set of the new movie ) would go for a lunch in the middle of day in that t-shirt without a bra with boobs that big ? 
  it hurts and it 's extremly uncomfortable . 
  it may be her face , but i doubt it 's her body , or boobs are photoshopped . 
  her lips are average , but many women have even thinner lips . 
  beady eyes ? 
  probably just awful makeup . 
  crooked nose ? 
  maybe a bit big , but overall i think she 's cute, 
  i think she is cute . 
  different picture , longer hair/different hairstyle and she would be beautiful . 
  i really do n't see why people here think she 's unatttractive . 
  i 'll count you as spain .

  i 've been to sarajevo about a year ago ( october 2013 ) and i must say i loved it . 
  a half of the city is very ottoman and gives you a bit of an oriental feeling , while the other half is very habsburg-like and can be compared to a couple of other capitals . 
  i really liked it there becuase it feels old . 
  its history is really sad though :( ... 
  yes , fraknfurt is the bank centre of germany if i recall correctly . 
  [ carantania was pretty cool too , i guess ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carantania ),

  women are not , but they can join if they want so . 
  what do you call a `` slovenian girl '' then ? 
  actually , ~ 50 % voted . 
  idk where you got 38 from . 
  nobody knows since he didnt talk much about his programme during the campaign and he has n't been involved in politics yet . 
  he is a lawyer and a law professor though so he seems like a good guy on paper . 
  is he capable of leading a country ? 
  i do n't know , only time will tell . 
  he is his running mate ( although we do n't have anything similar to a running mate in slovenia and most definitely not during parliamentary elections ) . 
  their campaign budget was 500 $ and candidates had to pay for the gas and other stuff out of their own pockets ( when they met their voters for the campaign ) . 
  also as you said they received no recognition from any media and basically relied on twitter and facebook to reach out to their voters . 
  they only made an appearance on tv once i believe and that was two days before the election day . 
  ** slovenia ** - [ 2014 preliminary elections ] ( http://www.rtvslo.si/news-in-english/cerar-looks-to-form-new-government/341911 ) - cardiologists of ukc maribor went on strike due to their salaries being lower than those of the cardiologists in ukc ljubljana - miners from velenje coal mines are no longer on strike, 
  to expand on this . 
  he is self-proclaimed `` neither left - nor right-wing '' , the foundation of his political programme is [ rechtsstaat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rechtsstaat ) . 
  he was very vague and did n't uncover much during his campaign though , so nobody know much about him , but people seem to trust him and he 's a new face who has n't been in politics before . 
  he promised a fight against corruption and careful privatization . 
  he is a very cautious person , i 'll give him that at least . 
  the thing in slovenia is that the new parties count on the undecided segment of the voters to vote for them . 
  they get votes because they are new and people have hope in them . 
  last time a new party won the elections ( 2011 ) it came back and bit us in the ass . 
  hope the story will not repeat itself this year ( i believe it wo n't ) . 
  in slovenia , being the `` new face '' is pretty much 80 % of the elections ( except for sds ) . 
  you can see that in zoran jankovi\u0107 's victory in the 2011 elections ( he failed to form a coalition ) who was then succeeded by first janez jan\u0161a ( whose government failed ) and then by alenka bratu\u0161ek ( who failed to carry out the remainder of the mandate ) . 
  now i hope that the same story wo n't happen with mr. cerar , but he has n't convinced me with his answers ( to me he seemed full of hot air ) . 
  but let 's see what he does first . 
  also , we have the entrenched parties in slovenia as well . 
  some of them always receive good results ( e.g. 
  sds , desus , they usually have really constant voters ) , some have been losing support lately ( sd , sls ) and some are pretty constant ( nsi ) , but i 'm pleased that we 've gotten many new parties in the parliament these elections ( smc , zl , zab - 45/90 seats which is a half ) . 
  does n't matter . 
  the elections [ `` were neither legitimate nor fair '' . 
  ] ( http://www.sds-online.org/index.php?slovenian-elections-were-not-fair-therefore-the-result-is-not-legitimate ) / s, 
  lem me translate for everyone that does n't speak slovene ( i.e. 
  pretty much everyone on / r/europe ) . 
  `` on the vignette there should be the official slovene motto `` i feel slovenia '' . 
  why ? 
  if not for anything else so that the croats who would have to buy the half-year vignette would also have to stare at the hated slovenia for half a year . '', 
  also , and this probably goes without saying , he 's a populist and a chauvinist and pretty much nobody takes him seriously . 
  yes we do . 
  this were their first parliamentary elections and they received a bit more than 1 % ( about 1,3 i believe ) . 
  the threshold for a seat is 4 % . 
  i see this as an accomplishment as their main voters are young people and in slovenia , young people are the demographic with the lowest turnout . 
  perhaps they 'll even come in the parliament come the next elections ( that would be 2018 assuming no preliminary elections take place ) . 
  it 's weird ( to me ) that many croats/serbs say that they do n't understand slovene very well , but we always understand what they say ( at least most of it ) . 
  the argument that slovenes were taught serbo-croatian in schools simply does n't make sense anymore , since it 's the same among the youth ( who do not learn serbian , croatian or serbo-croatian in school ) . 
  i 'm 17 and i have no problem understanding croatian/serbian ( speaking it is a bit different but still not so difficult ) , but according to some immigrants that i 've had a chance to talk to ( from serbia , croatia and other balkan/ex-yu countries ) , slovene is very hard to learn for them .

  i think it was -37 , recorded in babno polje ( which is not even in the alps or even near them for the matter ), 
  survey results coming soon ^ ^ tm . 
  it 's right up there in the `` banner '' . 
  since the articel is pretty short i will go more in-depth in the comments . 
  so during the weekend , there was [ a lot of raining ] ( http://www.rtvslo.si/news-in-english/bad-weather-paralyses-slovenia/328836 ) [ and snowing ] ( http://www.rtvslo.si/news-in-english/weather-still-causing-problems-in-slovenia/328892 ) , which led to ice gathering on the tree branches which eventually broke off . 
  some of these branches destroyed transformers/power lines which led to major blackouts throughout inner carniola ( notranjska ) , upper carniola , styria and carinthia . 
  basically every region was affected , but those were hit harder ( for example velenje , 3rd biggest city in styria was without electricity ) , i live in novo mesto ( lower carniola ) and we did n't have any major outages , but ko\u010devje region ( also lower carniola ) is without electricity , as is suha krajina . 
  very many schools and kindergartens ( 75 % have been advised to close the schools , 65 % have infact been closed ) cancelled the lessons , simply because it was unsafe for people to drive on the icy roades ( some roads are said to be glass-like , but in the big cities it is n't a real problem ) . 
  also , in the heavily forested areas , trees have fallen on the road making it impossible to go to the big cities where the schools are located . 
  public transport , such as trains and buses , has also suffered from delays . 
  of course the civil defence and the army were mobilised as soon as possible . 
  about 8000 repairmen are on the job at the moment . 
  the army even sent [ an apc ] ( http://img.rtvslo.si/_up/upload/2014/02/03/65072042_photo_375870_20140203.jpg ) to bring food to some parts of the country ( because they were inaccessible with a helicopter due to weather conditions ) and the repairs have already started . 
  it is estimated that about 500 tonnes of iron will be needed in order to fully repair the infrastructure . 
  slovenian government has also asked many countries , amongst them croatia , austria and italy to help them . 
  it is estimated that slovenia need 100 generators to bring the electricity back to homes because repairs could take over a week . 
  so far we 've gathered 31 . 
  the countries that have helped us are austria , czech republic and germany ( bavaria ) , while croatia has promised to help us as well . 
  poklicna matura ( the finals for vocation schools ) have also been postponed , since many students probably would n't be able to come anyways . 
  but as always , we must look on the bright side of things .

  they are hunting enemy combatants . 
  it 's not a murder if they 're armed enemy units who shoot back at you .

  this genetic stuff is fun to look at , but ultimately irrelevant . 
   most west part ( istra ) were formaly inhabited mostly by slovenians . 
  not true . 
   and so both sides understood and contented themselves and reached an accord and put their signs on the demarcation , and to the one and the other side the charters were written in latin and ** croatian ** language , while the lords kept copies in german language .

  they did n't , they wore normal italian uniforms . 
  partisans called them `` white guard '' because the bolshies in the command whacked off to russian civil war .

  it 's not that the painting represents nationalism . 
  it 's that you , as a watcher , see nationalism in this painting . 
  your post above is not about overbeck , but about dashingrainbow . 
  this is fun !, 
  of course , let 's put aside that barthes said nothing about allegory , which is explicitly meant to convey an author 's extra-textual idea . 
  if partisans were the bad guys , then croatia should do what good guys usta\u0161e did , which is give istria and dalmatia to italy . 
  it has nothing to do with you and everything with neo-usta\u0161as being loud and annoying . 
  direct democracy is amazing in theory and has a nasty potential to be a total shitshow ( kinda like communism , come to think about it . ), 
  i lost faith in it after our mayor ( who got elected on direct democracy platform ) organized a consultation with neighbors about replacing a crossroad with a roundabout . 
  it was awful . 
  participants simply refused to listen to any reason , disregarded any data that was presented to them and just kept screaming about random shit that had nothing to do with the issue ( or the mayor , for that matter ) . 
  i know that there is a certain xkcd comic used to reply to posts like this one , but people are fucking dumb .

  under him you managed to avoid the economic meltdown , keep up a healthy growth rate , lower unemployment via gastarbeiter work and become a respected country inside the eu . 
  plus he 's as likable as it is possible for a contemporary european politician . 
  so what 's the catch ?

  everybody normal called it `` bubamara '' too . 
  i vaguely remember `` bo\u017eja ov\u010dica '' being forced upon us kids in the 90 's . 
  because serbs say `` bubamara '' , therefore it 's absolutely haram to say that . 
  oh yeah , counting blood cells solves everything . 
  my identity , for example , became much clearer to me once i realized half my ancestors were from croatia and half from slovenia .

  some politicians might even lose their jobs for god 's sake . 
   last i checked , fbih controls drvar , bosanski petrovac , bosansko grahovo regions in which serbs are over 90 % majority . 
  now that the refugees are back , yes . 
  at the time lines were being drawn that area had a solid bosniak majority ( and was basically uninhabited ) . 
  ofc . 
  not everyone is for drugs . 
  i personally never really had fun on drugs , they either make me bored or annoyed .

   new people by the law but we are lacking nurses , doctors , policemans also , at least when it comes to doctors , some people do n't want to retire , so the young doctors could be employed . 
  or they do n't offer enough spots for students to specialize in certain sector . 
  media report we do not have anough doctors , but in reality goverment doesnt provide jobs for them . 
  they are selling our biggest companies to foregins at a very low price which is a big loss . 
  and our goverment does n't * know * how to improve the economy and lacks of business strategy .

   put a finger in her ass and vagina . 
  that is serious sexual assault . 
  also she can get genital disease ( not std ) , but infection due to whatever was in rapist hands . 
   court didnt deem that serious enough for jail time . 
  we have a big problem here . 
  no matter if it was finnish or somali or whatever , that is very serious . 
  it means they do n't understand you can not put fingers in a stranger 's ass/vagina if they did n't allow you to do that .

  i mean , i do n't have any trouble with the immigrants who respect the law . 
  also a lot of these immigrants are perfectly healthy young men who are capable of working . 
  except the ones from war zones ( which running away from that area is understandable ) , i think we could help them in africa by teaching them economy , how to run bussiness , etc , not just giving them food and money aid and guns . 
  that 's how africa could develop . 
  also trouble is many people come from countries where crime rates are high . 
  they wo n't change their mind or how to react when they live in west europe .

  it hurts like hell ... mar more than someone would slap you .

  from `` is it rape ? '' .

  there are no x degrees of rape . 
  if i say ` no ' , no matter what i wear , how much i drank , that means no .

   are there different degrees of rape ? 
  in this story , i do n't think it would be called rape , more like sexual assult or scam to get sexual advances .

  having different laws and police not being able to enter another state are two different things . 
  even if all eu countries had the exact same laws , this still does n't give the police of one country the right to enter another . 
  that 's something that would have to be agreed on separately . 
  i thought the police was allowed to pursue a suspect across the borders under certain circumstances , but i did a quick search and it seems that is not the case .

  `` you watched the match yesterday ? '',

   is it usual for your media to just say `` hrvati '' instead of `` hrvatski slu\u017ebenici '' or `` hrvatska policija '' ? 
  yes , pretty much . 
  `` croatia sends 5000 people across the green border '' for example . 
  they get more specific sometimes but it 's mostly `` hrva\u0161ka . '', 
  as for your second point , i never faulted croatia for sending people across , it 's a rough situation throughout the balkans . 
  the problem is the manner , why do it in the middle of the night and close to rivers when we accept everyone during the day any way ? 
  it 's making the situation even worse than it already is . 
  the dublin agreement says that . 
  eu countries have agreed that the country of entry needs to process the asylum claim . 
  well , the regulation says that one of the countries has to do it but since you ca n't travel inside the eu w/o papers it is effectively the first country . 
  this is what hungary is doing . 
  enforcing that anyone who wants to enter the country needs to ask for asylum . 
  no one wants to go because they ca n't just freely move around after doing that . 
  it 's funny how the story here is that croatia is the one always double-crossing us . 
  `` we never should have accepted them into the eu without a solved border , '' `` they 're once again trying to get out of fixing the border by refusing arbitration , '' the infamous '' [ hrvat je tat ( a croatian is a thief ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nayjmu468zm ) '' . 
  i could go on , haha . 
  in the end most of slovenia still goes to the croatian seaside and has a great time and croatia skis and ( at least used to ) shops in slovenia . 
  it 's usually the politicians that are stirring shit up before elections . 
  and the regular janez i hrvoje nationalists . 
  here , [ read up ( slo wiki ) ] ( https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovenska_osamosvojitvena_vojna ) . 
  the yugoslav tanks did come from army bases in croatia but at that point in time croatia could hardly stop them . 
  what do you mean by caught ? 
  if you mean successfully crossing , that can be done literally anywhere , we can hardly close down the border . 
  otherwise all ( supposedly ) the migrants do end rounded up any way and taken to camps . 
  it 's a question of minimising the harm to the migrants , which crossing rivers in the middle of the night certainly is n't . 
  [ full footage ] ( http://psn.sdn.si/psv/15/295/635811237801922147_151022-begunci_720p.mp4 ) *** this footage was created by the slovenian police with thermal cameras last night . 
  the aim is to show the world what is actually happening and why the refugees end up on fields in the middle of nowhere . 
  below are a few translated quotes from the speech of an interior ministry representative , from the press conference at 2pm :  `` upam , da bo tudi ta posnetek prispeval k razumevanju zgodbe . 
  croatia is sending migrants across the border in an organised , unannounced , and dispersed manner . 
  i do not see any compassion here , the groups contain children , pregnant women , and the elderly . 
  croatia is consciously letting them cross rivers . 
  this is how an eu member acts , trying to shift the blame for the severe circumstances on slovenia . 
  croatia is trying to discredit us . 
  i believe our professional and earnest attitude will allow us to cope . 
  the commissionaire needs to clearly be told our position and demands , we have addressed a formal letter to the eu comission . 
  38 thousands migrants have entered slovenia so far since friday . 
  posnetek govori sam za sebe , '' croatia does not prevent the crossing of rivers and does not try to redirect the refugees . 
  we are publishing this video because this is a farce , croatia saying slovenia is the inhumane one , not taking care of migrants , and lacking organisations . 
  the footage speaks for itself . 
  *** this is a pr battle as well . 
  the images of migrants wet and without aid on the fields are bad but europe needs to see how that happens . 
  plenty of children needed to be rushed to hospitals because of malnourishment and hypothermia . 
  we 're discussing different things here . 
  i can understand why croatia 's doing what she is , i 'm sure if we had milanovic and ostojic instead of our guys and gals we 'd be doing the same thing to austria . 
  even if the migrants somehow chose to be transported to small villages on the border , my point is still that it is up to the croatian police leading them to keep them from harm as much as possible . 
  either choose a safe ( as much as possible ) part of the border without rivers , or at least tell them where the bridge is . 
  this is where croatia is potentially wilfully ignorant , you could keep the migrants from entering a river by telling them where to go but did n't . 
  or did and the migrants did n't listen , we just have the video , no audio . 
  the crossing could also be done during the day , so migrants could see , instead of the middle of the night . 
  the point is that if croatian police brings them to the border so they can cross it , they could at least point out where the bridge is so the migrants do n't cross rivers . 
  croatia is choosing where the crossing happens , the migrants have n't a clue about the geography of the region . 
  switched intentionally with consciously . 
  it 's not so much intent as it is wilful ignorance , the river is there yet the refugees are n't pointed towards a bridge . 
  this needs a warning , it 's 700mb raw footage .

  ** 38 thousands migrants have entered slovenia so far since friday . 
  posnetek govori sam za sebe , '' croatia does not prevent the crossing of rivers and does not try to redirect the refugees . 
  we are publishing this video because this is a farce , croatia saying slovenia is the inhumane one , not taking care of migrants , and lacking organisations . 
  the footage speaks for itself . 
  *** this is a pr battle as well . 
  the images of migrants wet and without aid on the fields are bad but europe needs to see how that happens . 
  plenty of children needed to be rushed to hospitals because of malnourishment and hypothermia . 
  it 's a shitty situation all around , like i said , i understand croatia . 
  but the dumping , if it has to happen , could at least be marginally more organised with some heads up and not at night when people suffer the most . 
  it 's not like slovenia can do anything to prevent it , that 's more than clear . 
  as for the wall , that 's not happening , at least not any time soon . 
  you 'd just drive them somewhere else which makes it an exercise in futility , there 's 670km of border to cover - i do not think milanovic is beneath dumping people in the middle of a forest . 
   irrational i agree . 
  our government is famous for being the best at doing nothing and sustaining the status quo , the exact opposite of what 's needed in this situation . 
  as for your 4 possible solutions , the only valid one at the moment is begging , on both sides and the eu , which is what we 're doing . 
  i do not think this government has the balls to start dumping refugees . 
  it 's not a simple matter when we 're trying to stay on best terms with austria and germany , dumping them would surely have repercussions . 
  schengen and general eu rules forbid this . 
  everyone needs to be properly registered and that takes time . 
  before that migrants are forbidden from freely roaming the country , they need proper permits and with those papers they are only allowed to travel inside the country not across borders . 
  there 's a big difference between sending them over border crossings and dumping them unannounced along the border in the middle of the night . 
  i do not blame milanovic for sending them over , i despise him for the manner in which he 's doing it . 
  could more have been done ? 
  yes , for sure , most of the countries agrees . 
  the initial target was 2500 per day with provisions for about 5k in the worst case , now we 're getting twice that . 
  slovenia was counting on croatia to hold to an agreement but they did n't , worse than that , they 're actively dumping bus - and train-loads of refugees along the border instead of close to actual border crossings . 
  i do n't think all the preparation in the world would have helped here , we do not have the manpower or logistic strength to take care of such a number of people . 
  on the other hand slovenia is doing its best to hold to the agreement with austria ( as well as eu and un laws - registering everyone , providing care as best we can ) , only sending people through a single crossing and in limited groups ( thought he refugees break through on their own when they reach a critical mass of about 2k people ) . 
  according to police numbers we 're sending about 5-6k per day to austria and receiving 10k + from croatia . 
  if we were to do the same thing as croatia does , load people in buses and dump them along the austrian border at night , we would n't be having the problem . 
  its ' between half an hour to two from the croatian to the austrian border ( depending on the location ) and croatia supposedly offered to just drive their trains all the way . 
  if we were to act as the rest of the balkans do austria would be the one receiving 10k + per day and we almost would n't need any camps . 
  instead we 're following agreements and act humanely , as best we can . 
  the army is needed because we have a limited police force , on its own it can not handle dispersed refugees . 
  i do not think the regular people , especially in ljubljana , will be affected . 
  it 's a huge strain on the border regions and on everyone involved : police , army , aid workers .

  also , it 's 22.3 million . 
  not a historian so i guess i 'm not really answering your question ( but i have at least above average in knowledge of history ) , but the us and allies would probably have still won the war , albeit it would take longer due to nazi germany having more resources and troops on the western front and land in the east to use for industry where the allies could n't touch it . 
  many people seem to underestimate the position the us was in at the time of ww2 . 
  their geographical position was virtually unassailable , with their only land neighbors being not only allies , but also much weaker than the us in terms of military power . 
  they also had huge amounts of resources to sink into the war effort , so the added resources nazi germany would have on the west would merely slow them down . 
  they would also have nuclear weapons while germany still would n't be defeated , so they could 've used it the same way as in japan , or using it to utterly devastate german defenses , which would give them a superb opening to deliver the final blow.after sweeping over the western front to berlin , they would 've crippled germany , which would only leave bits and pieces to clean up in the east , if germany would n't have surrendered by that point . 
  tl ; dr : it would 've taken longer , but the us ' incredible global position combined with their resources would 've still defeated nazi germany . 
  ps : i 'm obviously not a historian and i betcha a real one would 've been able to go on for hours explaining this stuff . 
  the funding and permission is already provided , and i do n't think this community of bosnian muslims should be denied the center because qatar wants to fund when no one else will . 
  not that many , they 're mostly bosnian muslim immigrants that moved during yugoslavia or the war . 
  ** translation : ** * the foundation for the islamic cultural center has officially begun with mayor zoran jankovi\u0107 and islamic mufti ned\u017ead grabus symbolically pouring the concrete for the foundation . 
  also in attendance was qatari ambassador ali khalfan al-mansouri , who expressed satisfaction with the commencing of construction . 
  * the finished center will include a mosque , a washroom for ceremonial washing , educational , residential and administrative facilities , a parking lot , restaurant and a gym.the foundation of the center will be a 24m tall cube with a blue cupola above the praying grounds . 
  it will be adorned with a 40m minaret . 
  * this follows a years long debate about the need for the mosque and center , which was closed when the city council of ljubljana unanimously voted for the construction of the center . 
  the mufti has stated that for 40 years until now , muslims have had to walk the streets of ljubljana with their heads bowed , which this center will change . 
  * the mayor also said * `` we live together , respect each other , cooperate and maybe we can transfer this positive energy not only through slovenia , but also throughout europe '' * * the building and infrastructure will cost 22.3 million euros , 11.5 of which was already funded by qatar . 
  where the remaining money will come from is for now a mystery . 
  edit : the only thing qatar wants for funding is a plaque saying they funded , for now.this is not a qatari project . 
  woah there pal , slovenia has a tiny piece of land considered to be in the [ balkans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkans ) , even though we 'll only say we 're part of the balkans when it suits us , which you will notice me doing right now . 
  the kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty would 've collapsed way quicker . 
  not only did they act like absolutists in an alleged constitutional monarchy ( they even dropped the pretense for 5 years ( 1929-1934 ) , which only ended because the king was assassinated ) , they also were n't very well liked to begin with . 
  if they came back to power after the war , they would 've been deposed by another group who would 've gained favor with the people ( possibly aligned with nato or the warsaw pact ) or would 've been turned into a puppet regime by said powers . 
  yugoslavia became a better and much more stable place without them ( no shooting in parliament , yay ) for a time , and tito was most certainly a better alternative . 
  edit : ok , i think i know what you 're trying to say . 
  nobody cares about the point you 're trying to make when you 're using violence , because people see you destroying shit and decide you are n't worth listening to . 
  ironically , the rioters were protesting against the rich and against corporations , but the damage they 've done will be repaired with taxpayer euros . 
  can you not ? 
  we 've had numerous angry internet arguments a few months ago , we do n't need to open this particular can of worms again . 
  i 'm pretty sure most whistleblowers know getting assassinated is a risk before they go through with the act . 
  i 'm not even concerned . 
  the way i see it , even if the ttip gets through the eu parliament it still has to go through all 27 national parliaments ( [ one of which , syriza in greece , has already stated they are n't ratifying ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/trade-society/syriza-led-greek-parliament-will-never-ratify-ttip-311719 ) ) and the european council ( which syriza is a part of ) . 
  considering how much negativity the ttip is sorrounded with even when the negotiators are doing everything in their legal power to keep it as obscure as possible , the chance of it passing is just getting lower as it approaches finalization . 
  why is the sign on the ambulance the wrong way around yet the police and taxi are the right way . 
  i 'd go with either austria or croatia , probably croatia . 
  austria because we could get on our way to reuniting the empire !, 
  and croatia because they 're cool dudes and dudettes . 
  a `` debt driven card house economy '' is what allows the us to have 53000 $ dollars per capita vs russia 's 14000 $ . 
  next week : czech republic builds new capital called `` casterly rock '' . 
  yes , when it 's close . 
  but when it 's far away , a very slight change in trajectory will make it miss . 
  we have to fund bounty hunters and tell them to act as pirates , and since smugglers are republic they ca n't cooperate . 
  a fool proof plan . 
  de facto vs de jure : it is n't supposed to be a guideline , but nato would n't throw a member out if they failed to meet the 2 % gdp requirement so de facto it 's a guideline . 
  not true , we did n't get a goodwill rock , yugoslavia did . 
  if i dared to guess , the rock was probably `` inherited '' by serbia . 
  it 's just a guess though , and if they actually split the rock between the republics do feel free to correct me . 
  it 's more like a guideline . 
   now the revamped particle smasher is 60 % more powerful than before for a machine to smashes shit together at near light speed that sentence does n't make me feel very safe . 
  edit : jesus fucking christ , i was joking , people, 
  you better , you landlocked pretender . 
  croatians would never paint their seaside houses like that . 
  by triglav do you mean our [ warship !, 
  that 's what i meant by yugos , immigrants from other republics of yugoslavia . 
  the yugos are gon na beat the shit out of you in ljubljana m8 . 
  ca n't argue there . 
  seems like an ultimatum to the troika - `` work with us or we 'll work with russia . '', 
  oh , he 's everyone 's collective hat salesman . 
  is n't he the guy who asked germany for ww2 reparations ? 
  do n't know how realistic this goal actually is . 
  russia is n't in an economic situation to lower prices on pretty much their main export . 
  and the troika has greece in a stranglehold so they can just threaten to not help out next time if greece goes through with this.and i 'm fairly sure the greek government knows all of this already , so this just seems like another defiant move against the troika than anything else . 
  edit : englosh herd, 
  croatia , it 's almost the same as slovenia except different language i already know and more clay . 
  you can say that because you know what happened . 
  if you do n't actually know there 's a crazy pilot flying your plane then it 's a completely reasonable assumption that the door is stuck and we 're landing to fix it . 
  i do n't think it 's very likely it 'll go through . 
  these things usually get a lot more attention the closer they are to getting through ( thing sopa ) and the more attention it gets , the more campaigns will be spurred and will grow that are against the ttip , these movements will put pressure on politicians and politicians are very inclined to change their stance when their job is on the line . 
  this might not actually be needed as well , because any single national party in any eu country which has a parliamentary majority can choose to not ratify the agreement which is basically a veto . 
  greece 's syriza has already [ publicly stated ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/trade-society/syriza-led-greek-parliament-will-never-ratify-ttip-311719 ) that they will not ratify it in it 's current form . 
  not only can a national parliament veto it , but a european council member can as well ( they are eu heads of state ) . 
  tl ; dr : i do n't think it has much of a chance of passing if it were to be ratified tomorrow , much less many months from now . 
  and that useful stuff can usually be bought from someone else , you 're also overestimating the profit that extracting this `` useful stuff '' can be when you compare it to the cost of building up infrastructure and handling logistics in a place as huge as russia . 
  did n't wan na die from bolognese sauce overdose anyway . 
  i do n't know about that . 
  in slovenia it 's common to insultingly refer to italians as * makaronarji * , which means macaroni people ( and not in any conceivable good way ) . 
  common stereotypes portray italians waving their hand with thumb , index and middle finger combined while talking , not knowing a word of english , being short and having dark , slicked ( * polizane * = licked ) back hair , and being loud . 
  you 're also going to find a * trst je na\u0161 !, 
  * ( trieste is ours ! ), 
  graffiti in just about every town with a population over 1000 people . 
  there 's also the common stereotype about betraying their allies or surrendering or being completely useless at war . 
  edit : and of course : mafia controls all of italy and equating italians to berlusconi . 
  no more than western europeans . 
  in fact , due to communism , it matters even less . 
  someone believes something that hitler among thousands of others believed and it 's automatically supporting hitler 's ideas , genious !, 
  might as well go out on the street and call everyone with hair a nazi because hey , hitler had hair . 
  the problem yugoslavia would have is that slovenia borders austria and italy , two relatively wealthy and large countries . 
  war on their borders would mean refugees on their doorstep . 
  if they would n't get involved directly they would double the effort to get the us/nato in there asap . 
  italy - meals are very large , tourist sites look much bigger in person , it 's very dirty , i do n't think traffic laws exist . 
  ( rome ), 
  i think it 's just generalizing because people see one homeless guy drinking beer and assume all they do is spend all the money they gain from begging to buy alcohol/drugs . 
  obvious secret message to valve detected . 
  it sounds really weird in english because sun is so close to son . 
  we say `` jebem ti sunce '' ( = i 'm fucking your sun ) we were trying to be cool and misheard it . 
  this ca n't be right , there 's not a chance in hell that 42 % of slovenians speak german . 
  both are bad , but i 'd rather have us hegemony than russian hegemony . 
  while i agree with you , it was always strongly implied that it was nukes , no one ever talked about taking away iraq 's chemical weapons , everyone talked about taking away their imaginary nuclear weapons . 
   i heard that solar panels last no more than 10 years for example . 
  not quite .

  fake , there 's no fog . 
  its been all over italian facebook recently . 
   martin garrix [ animals si voooolaaaaaa diocaneeeeee ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgmnoapy64e ), 
  ah so it was your camper blocking the road that one time . 
  yeah no wonder you thought there was italian influence there lol , the local dialects are all a mix of ita & slo . 
  depends where you were tbh . 
  west has a lot of italian influence , north has more german influence and the northeast has some hungarian influence , in general terms . 
  true in most slavic languages , but since we have a thing for being special snowflakes , grad just means castle over here . 
  they probably travelled faster tbh, 
  oh its still the first one ? 
  now that i think of it , we did start in 2nd grade of elementary school , while english was only in 5th grade . 
  thought it changed . 
  huh , i heard from a girl that attended gimnazija koper that you could choose not to have italian . 
  but this was years ago so i might be misremembering . 
  i attended the italian high school in koper so italian was kiiiinda obligatory for me :p, 
  we have an italian minority in our chunk of istra , remember ? 
  also italian is taught as a third language ( obligatory up to a certain point , you can swap it with german or french in high school iirc ) on the coastal region . 
  probably in nova gorica & surrounding area too . 
  and there 's all the italians from trieste who prefer to live in diva\u010da / se\u017eana because its cheaper . 
  in trieste there is both a serbian & a greek orthodox church dating to the 19th century , since those are two of the historical communities within the port city . 
  there 's also quite a few russians/ukranians . 
  you 'd really have to do your own research for more in-depth answers . 
  there 's only so much you can find out from reddit comments . 
  but by the time the teheran conference took place , the democratic movements were either part of the partisans , the collaborationists or faded into obscurity because of their inaction . 
  i never said it was to be ignored . 
  some of them committed war crimes . 
  i do n't think there 's a side that did n't in ww2 tbh but that does n't excuse it . 
   with that logic being under the soviet russia would have been fantastic !, 
  sure , bring that up when one of the first things i said was `` without the partisans we ( together with the rest of jugoslavia ) would have been just another ussr satellite state . '', 
  sure does sound that i 'd like us to have been another soviet republic , huh ? 
  but to answer your questions , i also respect the millions of russians who gave their lives to defeat the nazis . 
  sadly they were ruled by a dictator who was n't much better ( some would even say worse ) than uncle adi . 
  when you have someone like that in charge , bad shit is bound to happen . 
   not sure , there must have been a home grown movement in yougoslavia for democratic rule . 
  sure . 
  part of it fought with the partisans , but were a minority in the group and their voices did n't count enough ( or were made not to count if you catch my drift ) . 
  there were other movements but they were either non-violent ( and therefore became irrelevant as the war progressed ) or eventually opposed the partisans so much that they joined the collaborators . 
  as for the regime , it was ( from what the elders say ) pretty much like that . 
  not amazing , but better than the warsaw pact and with way more relaxed borders ( after a decade or so after ww2 ) . 
   and slovenes and croats in italian istria would have been safe . 
  they were n't exactly super safe in the first place , ever since mussolini came into power ( and even before that , the blackshirts were harassing and beating up people ), 
   in italy the anti communist rhetoric was still going strong well into the 2000s good old silvio 's `` i comunisti mangiano i bambini '', 
  yes but we are pretending to not be balkan so we ca n't really take over the coast the old-fashioned way . 
  also our 5 soldiers ( marko is currently on ~ ~ vacation ~ ~ * recon mission * in krk atm so i guess that makes it 4 ) apparently made you paranoid enough that you are thinking of reinstating mandatory military service , so yay us ? 
  treaty of trianon is the one that annoys the magyars `` revise trianon '' is both a meme and an actual demand among the hungarian right wing according to a couple magyar acquaintances of mine . 
  look man , just the fact that you put evil and partisans in the same sentence is troubling to me . 
  they were n't saints , and some of them definitely committed atrocities on the levels of the occupiers . 
  but for crying out loud , these are the people who gave their lives to free us from said occupiers . 
  and just for that they deserve to be remembered and respected . 
  should n't be , considering the amount of italians that fought together with them after the 8th of september 1943 . 
  and please , do n't mention the foibe or the 40 days because then i 'd have to start with the whole list of atrocities committed during the ventennio fascista in the slavic lands under zio benito 's control . 
  and nobody really wants to hear that . 
  both you & the other guy are conveniently forgetting that without the partisans we ( together with the rest of jugoslavia ) would have been just another ussr satellite state . 
  oh and they , you know , fought the nazis , fascists and other collaborationist scum that is somehow glorified today in some circles of our society . 
  as for the atrocities , there is no denying that they happened . 
  ww2 was n't exactly what you would call a `` clean '' war . 
  i do n't know why , but the tone of voice of the announcers from the italian fascist era is so hilarious to me . 
  they always finish on a strong note or emphasize the enemy ( serbs in this video ) with contempt . 
  better than the alternative . 
  i dare you to post a `` stray cats of vicenza '', 
  [ pretty much this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=much5x98rxg ), 
  ah so that 's where they collect all the bikes they 've stolen in the early '40s . 
  which is a brilliant piece of comedy/satire . 
  [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9_h219zqu ) [ italian subtitles part 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udlfwgrhlhu ) & [ part 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpbel6xuwco ) sadly i do n't know if there is an english subtitled version somewhere , [ only the international trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_pv_xko4r0 ) , but even if there was , quite a lot of the jokes would get lost in translation . 
  it very rarely reaches those speeds in trieste tbh . 
  bora/burja/bura is strongest in the vipava valley ( slo ) and in some areas in dalmacija ( cro ) . 
  trieste 's 140 km/h peaks are laughable in comparison , especially given they are partly protected by the nearby hills . 
  more like ultrasmurfs amirite, 
   i was surprised that croatia felt like a mini-italy in comparison too . 
  if you went to the istrian part , no suprise there . 
   i was an erasmus student in trieste . 
  in retrospect we would have had a nicer time in ljubljana probably . 
  unless you like gloomy fog , probably not . 
  units has its issues , but its pretty fun and trieste has plenty of cool bars . 
  when were you there ? 
  we might have bumped into each other if it was in the last 3-4 years lol . 
  it is pretty nice , at night especially . 
  shame its also kinda dead then . 
  if an army is there however , it is n't facing the germans and maybe the marne offensive does succeed , the kaiser 's army walks in paris and all is indeed over by christmas . 
  what ifs , and all that . 
  so the austrian version of cadorna then . 
  if you went to koper you should have taken a trip to piran aswell . 
  peaceful af , especially outside of the tourist season . 
  either way , what did you think of the palm trees ? 
  btw were you in trieste because of erasmus ? 
  tbh czechs die/get lost in our mountains too czechs and mountains do n't mix in general, 
  refo\u0161k  teran and for both , if you want the good stuff you go to some small winemaker . 
  preferrably from the brda area , but there are some good ones on the coast . 
  vinakoper is meh-tier . 
   and slovenia just does n't fit in balkans our drivers and a lot of our mentality is very much balkan, 
  pls get in line for the claiming of trst . 
  there 's also their indipendentists ( lol ) , austria , some habsburg successor , etc. 
  that would be great . 
  less money for mami\u0107 is a good thing ( given your username , you 'll probably agree :p ), 
  so you actually want it ? 
  if its of any consolation , the rest of us have the same opinion of the folks from ljubljana, 
  how is he doing btw ? 
  one of our better coaches . 
  inb4 top kek, 
  lol , your gf is bullshitting you .

  smile because ~ ~ it happened ~ ~ it 's over . 
  ftfy, 
  data from 2010 . 
  not criticising , but i was looking for it and wanted to make it clear . 
  lol , cheese . 
  you ca n't be reasonably against something that has n't even been written yet , much less published . 
  at the moment this is just histeria based on nothing specific . 
  i missed the part where we all get enslaved by monsanto and still somehow end up unemployed . 
  must be in the addendum . 
  the russian government needs to realise that their so called area of interest has people living in it . 
  those people are a huge factor in deciding what happens there . 
  moscow has been ignoring them to its own detriment . 
  the us has engaged with them to their advantage . 
  a hostile attitude from the kremlin wo n't change this trend . 
   encroach ( intransitive verb )  1 : to enter by gradual steps or by stealth into the possessions or rights of another  2 : to advance beyond the usual or proper limits romania is an independent , sovereign state and a member of nato . 
  neither of the definitions apply . 
  [ please tell me which part of the russian border you could possibly encroach on from romania .

  what the hell is this guy 's problem !? 
  i can understand when he does really cynical shit that produces , or could potentially produce , some benefit for russia or his regime . 
  but this and a number of other actions he 's taken recently are just unnecessarily dickish . 
  it is n't here and we seem to be one of the few european countries without a nationalist party in parliament . 
  it 's best to let these idiots display their stupidity . 
  i think the memory of moscow is what keeps them going when they get tired on the way to the west . 
  i ended up answering all of them , but i know next to nothing about geothermal and did n't really understand the ownership question , so a dk option would have been a good idea . 
  in case anyone wanted to know what that is : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kibo_ ( iss_module ), 
  those sneaky southern slavic socialists . 
  if you can give me a source for that i 'd be happy to update the map . 
  concrete ( literally ) examples of how insufficient investment into infrastructure produces a debt which does n't show up in the budget statistics : http://www.dw.de/the-downside-of-germanys-balanced-budget/av-17753544, 
  i do n't get it . 
  why not default ? 
  it would have an impact on the banks , but the ecb seems to be happy to feed them easy cash foie gras style nowadays , so that should n't be too big a deal , should it ? 
  good point . 
  take your middle eastern conflict back to the middle east . 
  what 's the problem here ? 
  if you do n't want the free food , do n't take it . 
  is this all the information we have on this ? 
  do we know how many people were involved ? 
  do we know there were multiple people involved in this ? 
  if the foreign ministry says you should n't go somewhere because of too much danger , but you go anyway , you should be on your own . 
  the man is a mouthpiece for the hard left . 
  a group which is not relevant to the economic and political realities in the 21st century . 
  a shadow of a bygone era .

  edit : at least \u017di\u017eek has the marketing instinct to be funny . 
  you 'll have to pick one of those . 
  i wish the euro had motifs . 
  but what can you do ? 
  after all europe has always been bereft of creativity . 
  they make me angry at my internet provider . 
  how the person was captured should be a big part of the decision . 
  unfortunately people down vote because of disagreement and not based on quality or interest . 
  chin up !, 
  i think the negotiation process is too technical to accelerate for these sort of political reasons . 
  i think montenegro is far enough ahead to get in first . 
  go for a swim , tulip monkey,

  so , do i have to start running in circles right now or can i do all my panicking over the weekend .

  i 've failed exams with better performances than that . 
  we are so sorry . 
  not the responsibility of any state , but of any ship in the area .

   those are our waters mare nostrum did n't take place in territorial waters , but in international waters . 
  not our responsibility . 
   if you crashed with your car and i drive past you is it `` my problem '' to call the ambulance ? 
  there 's a difference between you driving by as a coincidence and what mare nostrum was . 
  it would be like you spending your free time driving around looking for traffic accidents . 
  clearly not your responsibility . 
  i we do n't deal with them as a priority , they 'll get bigger over time . 
  are you suggesting we wait until our problems are as severe as theirs are before we take steps to rectify them ? 
  i think they 're already severe enough to justify a course of action whereby we concentrate on fixing them as opposed to throwing money at an infinite problem which is n't ours to begin with . 
   i 'd love for you to point out where i said that . 
  if europe did n't have a negative impact on the level of development in africa today , why bring up colonialism in the first place ? 
  if your assertion has any weight , why is n't ethiopia better developed than the countries which were so horrifically exploited by colonial rule ? 
  the question here is n't one of moral perfection , rather it 's one of ** net impact . 
  ** at the end of the day , though , this is hardly relevant . 
  in europe , taxpayers get a say in how their money is spent . 
  spending it to facilitate undesired human traffic across the mediterranean is a waste of public money . 
  here you go http://faculty.georgetown.edu/amm223/internationalmigration.pdf, 
  ok or not , switzerland has proven it to be the smart thing to do . 
  i bring it up because your entire line of argumentation rests on the baseless assertion that africa was one step short of paradise before the big bad europeans arrived and destroyed this eden . 
  there 's a reason you do n't see people deserting cities to set up tribal societies en masse . 
  the reason is that those sorts of societies suck !, 
  hobbs was right , rousseau was wrong . 
  this aspect of reality did n't change just because america had woodstock . 
  the platitude is strong in this one . 
  yes , but in a much different context . 
  one where there 's credible law enforcement on the african side acting to counter trafficking . 
  welcome to capitalism . 
  everybody exploits everybody else . 
  whoever wins gets to be rich . 
  there 's a broader issue here . 
  the underlying cause needs to be dealt with - starting with north africa . 
  we desperately need a framework of institution building assistance for the fragile and broken states in this region . 
  there has to be a southern partnership - sooner rather than later .

  and i have one friend we know each other from childhood and this guy is the biggest slovene , but his dad is dentist and he lives in slovenia for 25 years and does not speak the language . 
  so problem with immigration is complex and it depends on from where people are coming and there social status . 
  when i was working in one factory i meet bunch of bosnian ( ofc . 
  slo is spanish village ) and some of them have plans to stay in slovenia for five years and then move to germany as slovenian citizens and what they told me is that a lot of them do similar . 
  also those who are unhappy due to whatever reason in slovenia tend to move out as long as they can , but you will always end up with some guys doing , you know what . 
  so the way i see it , is that we will get more and more immigrants . 
  we have 87k unemployed as of end of may , basically with the current growth we end up in our natural unemployment ( 60-65k ) by the end of next year , meaning we will start massively import working force like we did before 2009 . 
  so most of them will be just gastarbeiters but some will stay . 
  the thing i 'm trying to say is that , it would be smart to be open towards them , tell them what norms are accepted in slovenia , teach our kids about and help them to integrate . 
  if they dont want to then fuck it , lost case , you ignore them . 
  another problem which may arise is also eg . 
  this kids will have identity crisis , since they will feel eg . 
  bosnians in slovenia and slovenians in bosnia . 
  so during their childhood if they were ostracized and marginalized from some brainiacs eg . 
  skins , they will turn during puberty into this rebel mode and start to despise everything slovenian and congrats you made yourself a new \u010defur . 
  i know it 's complicated and everyone has its own view of it but i think we should get the most out of it . 
  we are not the first nation this is happening and we wo n't be the last one . 
  sorry for freaking long text . 
   minimum salary in poland is also higher than in greece and portugal i 'd be careful here . 
  i 'd say it is bigger when it is ppp adjusted , otherwise some might laugh at you . 
  i always hate this one way conversations . 
  i hope you grow up one day and be able of having an adult conversation and come up with at least three different conclusions beside black & white . 
  the thing is if those people are moving in and getting citizenships they are technically slovenians . 
  now it 's on you to make them integrate easier and show them ropes around or you know the other way around become a skinhead and kick them around which starts the vicious cycle of violence and prejudices . 
  mind that some of those albanians are bigger slovenians than you might be . 
  that 's nice greece so i guess we drink tonight !, 
  damn i did n't know . 
  i was thinking that this would be called as north east croatia cuz you know it 's super duper more to the east than istra . 
  but thanks to enlighten me :d, 
  when someone says we are culturally closer to croatians we have especially in mind [ northeastern croatians ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5fkveewvqs ) and istra . 
  they have similar traditions , music , language in kajkavian regions , food and similar history, 
  the thing is i wouldnt trust some ex-yu statistics . 
  in one i remember that they said that slovenia had in 1989 around [ 30k ] ( https://chnm.gmu.edu/1989/archive/fullsize/econ-module-yogu-gdp-chart-8_b2af6c1915.jpg ) per capita . 
  and that we needed like 20 years to catch up . 
  but the thing is if we check countries back than who had more than 30k , well they are only two swiss and luxenbourg . 
  sadly i ca n't find the full article . 
  considering my village did not have canalization , we did n't even have bathtub in my house ... so yeah figures dont ad up . 
  here you can check up stats for other countries at the time in [ ppp per capita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_past_and_projected_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita #imf _ estimates_between_1990_and_1999 ) .

   [ alpine tiger ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8kv-mjinm ), 
  this year slovenia will finally catch up its pre-crisis level of gdp . 
  its a small [ place ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ankaran ) there at the see . 
  after the pray the mosque suddenly returned into its previous shape ... oh it did n't , damn gods why are we praying and killing then ... seriously wtf god/s * spelling, 
  why i have this weird feeling that i had to blow up this damn in some fps . 
  fun fact [ elan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt2jmdxuujs&amp;t=0m33s ) is not producing only [ skis ] ( http://www.elan-yachts.com/ ) . 
  i do n't know much about impol other than they produce aluminum . 
  well it was as long it was in hands of slovenes and croats ... now since they have a new owner they are doing fine ... and also tam still exists  just not in the same form as it used to during yugo ... peko im not sure there were some movements to keep some production but im not sure what happened since, 
  dude elan is alive and kicking , 
  the picture linked is not that far from the reality ... meaning that german guy there will dig for 7 and half hours and than leave ( he would use better equipment ) , while others would stay there for few more since their equipment is not so developed and they need to spend more time for the same work ... 
  they will all clock in more hours than the german guy , but he will get more money out since his work is more efficient ... especially if we think about money produced by worker per hour . 
  now do n't think that construction sector in germany or greece are drastically different but difference on the country level is made by added value in industry and other sectors and % of population working within . 
  where you can make same product in one country by 4 guys working it or one guy operating 3 robots and this leads to a snowball effect . 
  if you just take a look at export added value of [ greece ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/grc/#exports ) and [ germany ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/deu/#exports ) you ' can tell that most of the products in german graph would cost more on the market . 
  now if we take average [ gross salary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) of germany 3700 $ and greece 1200 $ and divide this with numbers of hours worked we can see a even bigger gap ... 
  the thing is greece is not lazy but just vastly less efficient . 
  like comparing feudal system with industrial revolution , guess who will have more hours clocked in . 
  and the working hours do n't give the full picture here . 
  long story short ... tycoonzation through political background and parties connection in the banking sector was basically the only model of privatisation prior crisis ... there were some exceptions i cant remember more but eg . 
  lek about the ownership ... you saw where money was going when they were in `` slo '' hands ... anyways the best deal is that company is paying taxes and employees workers and invests into equipment . 
  and do n't think i 'm saying that foreign owners are better ... the thing is we have no people in slovenia who would be able to buy companies without being a tycoon . 
  maybe i was n't clear enough ... the golden time for it was during 2000s ... especially during 2003-2007 , when we could get as much money out as we got later on in debt ps : i didnt read your second part : about people ... i find them funny dreaming of swiss where capital is in private hands going from one hand to another for centuries ... while we were expecting country will do as good job as those traditional family companies, 
  well people were naive ... thinking that having nature like swiss is the only prerequisite . 
  soon after succession it was obvious that transition will be hard , especially since an average janez ( serotipical slovenian name refered by other ex-yu ) doesnt want that privatisation and this was hijacked by politicians and used for their advantages . 
  preaching that if the companies will be state owned this will lead to swiss like standart ... but they had their own agenda in play . 
  anyways it started good and the only companies who went bankrupt were socialist relics of the past era , most of the companies prosper in state ownership ... all possible agencies were recommended to start with privatisation during 2000s when some companies reached its peak on stock markets , but this did n't happen and financial crisis hit and most of the companies were in big financial troubles . 
  long story short slovenia actually did start more nationwide privatisation in the last few years . 
  and also people figure it out that if the company is owned by some foreign capital that does n't change much for them as long as company is running in good shape ... anyways mentality of economics is slowly catching up with average janez, 
  there is also no [ k\u00f6nigsberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaliningrad ) , malta , cyprus on it,

  basically a layout of eurozone, 
  after checking this map i get the feeling that moving out does n't have the same meaning everywhere . 
  me personally i 'm studying abroad for six years now and this is regarded by some as living on your own but in slovenia you are still living with your parents as long as you dont get a job and pay your own bills-scholarship doest count . 
  in the case of slovenia the only problem for homosexual couples is adoption , sure there is some step-child adoption but its not the same as for regular couples . 
  and adoption is also where public debate gets messy , because it gets hijacked by some clergy groups and some political parties and then it becomes more of a discussion between them than actual gay people ... eg . 
  i 'm not voting for gay marriage and adoption since i dont like the party who came out with this referendum etc. 
   we have zimmer frei !!, 
  : ddd noup dude dein zimmer sind belegt mehr als frei ... its besser that way ^ ^ ^ ^ anyways countries missing there 1q gdp growth data will be published on 8th of june by eurostat and most likely a few days before by their governments or some other statistical agencies . 
  im hopping for a nice and steady growth in hrva\u0161ka this and next year !, 
  it 's not just the recent history . 
  also when slavic tribes settled the central and southern europe this area wasnt empty prior to them , but they mixed with people already living there and after that there were medieval conalizations - bringing people from non-slavic language background and also there were few new invasions of some other tribes ... all in all its pointless to talk about them as a genetic group . 
  today you can notice the differences between all three slavic groups ( east , west and south ) and also within the group . 
  fyi slavic/germanic/latin are linguistic terms and not the genetic . 
  i can understand this only because i can understand besides my native languages and its dialects also most of bcs languages and slovakian and some of cz ... otherwise some of the context here would be different , otherwise there are quite a few false friedns, 
  i did n't mean this as one of the reasons for the new technical recession but it was something in general that i was wondering if it 's still around and it got fixed, 
  if you consider that finland has much higher nominal gdp per capita than countries joined after 2004 you can much more appreciate how big this 1.6 % is . 
  romania with the growth of 1.7 % gets shadowed in this terms since romania has sth like 10k in nominal terms per capita and finland has 4x more ... 
  you need to ask some romanian guy ... i just copy paste that yodeling into youtube, 
   horea cu noduri is this how it would sound ? 
  i guess it 's similar to what i can hear in serbia ... thanks for the info !, 
  ow ok ... and i thought that you might have some polka/yodeling ensembles like in alpine countries, 
  i just wonder is it common to have folk-music with yodeling in romania ? 
  i 'd imagine if it is , its most likely in ex-austrian/hungarian monarchy areas . 
  this is a flash estimate for the first quarter of 2017 . 
  the data for the countries missing here will be published on 8th of june by eurostat . 
  one of the rumors that is going around is also that bunch of greek businesses especially on the islands do n't give official bills , therefore do n't pay tax . 
  i wonder what can you say on this and also is there any estimate on how much tax compared to gdp is/was lost due to it .

  this would be the thread to do it in, 
  in europe , the number is 66 % in case you missed it . 
  can someone tell me why we have the battle-groups if we 're not even going to use them in these sort of cases ? 
  better to do an ad hoc thing , really ? 
  in other news : 30 % of europeans ca n't use the internet for various reasons, 
  i 'll get that to you by the end of the day  would you like ppp or nominal per capita, 
  made the nominal as well, 
  [ nominal gdp by popular demand . 
  [ kofetarica ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/ivana_kobilca_-_kofetarica.jpg ) ( the coffee woman ), 
  i prefer ppp because it tries to tell you how much people can afford to buy , what their standard of living is . 
  1000 $ in slovenia or 1000 $ in belgium are not the same thing, 
  irrelevant . 
  statements stand or fall on their own merits . 
  are you really willing to dismiss thoughtfull engagement simply based on national origin ? 
  that would just be silly, 
  everything in the sky flies , but there 's a big difference between a seagull and b2 stealth bomber, 
  but cyprus is n't geographically in europe at all ... so , what gives ? 
  the germans are being clever as always . 
  their statement proves itself ... seriously , made me laugh, 
  thank god ... 
  i was worried there for a bit, 
  fair enough , i guess certainly more sensible than the other two, 
  wait , really ? 
  do you ever vote for a pm ? 
  nice effort . 
  the president of slovenia ( edit - a week ago ) : [ pic1 , ] ( http://www.vecernji.hr/media/cache/ab/18/ab18e2eca8587e136a5a8607ac9056a0.jpg ) [ pic2 , ] ( http://www.radiokrka.com/portals/160051_189393_pahor_vojska.jpg ) [ pi3 , ] ( http://www.pivka.si/userfiles/959/image/2014/civilna%20zascita/img_0354.jpg ) [ pic4 , ] ( http://www.gorenjskiglas.si/storyimage/gg/20140212/c/140219950/v1/0/v1-140219950.jpg ) [ pic5 , ] ( http://www.vecernji.hr/media/cache/a7/eb/a7eb6ff8ea9dd058689f6ba72f960349.jpg ) [ pic6 , ] ( http://www.up-rs.si/up-rs/uprs.nsf/0/0898a782f89cb110c1257c78004cb906/$file/m_photo.jpg ) [ pic7 ] ( http://img.rtvslo.si/_up/upload/2014/02/07/65073484_bf3x99oieaa-bvl.jpg ) the funny thing is that he 's really popular as it is , so he does n't really need to be doing this .

  [ here you go ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnia_and_herzegovina_convertible_mark#exchange_rates ), 
  bloomberg seems to be encroaching on polandball territory . 
  oh , like bosnia ?

  let 's keep our racism classy , mkay ? 
   socially engineered circle jerk tomato , tomato, 
  i know , but as i understand it , they have to at this point , do n't they ? 
  so you did n't catch that this was actually just a copy edit of your own comment from earlier how sad - it 's not even sporting anymore, 
  you completely missed the point , but that 's what i 'd expect from a self-righteous lunatic, 
  we liked the illyrian provinces . 
  no offence to austria , but you were a bit overbearing at the time . 
  ok , now you 're just rambling incoherently . 
  ah , i remember the good old days when being seen anywhere [ near slovenia on a list was a national insult . 
  ] ( http://www.mojvideo.com/video-prizor-nasa-mala-klinike-iz-filma-sicko/0ec50d3f2e3143a558e4 ), 
  oh , i was n't aware of this . 
  thanks for the info . 
  how sad for you, 
  you break a contract , it renders the contract void . 
  what 's with the drama ? 
  [ perspective ] ( http://thegreatgeekmanual.com/images/humor/motivational/october/motivational-poster-perspective-fuck-rules.jpg ), 
  if one side is in a position to negotiate a better deal , that makes even more economic sense . 
  then movement of capital , goods and services is in the same category and can be restricted unilaterally as well again , if you want to talk in terms of westphalian sovereignty , then everything is internal , but at that point , you ca n't complain if people embargo you , since it 's their sovereign right to do so rules are either followed and enforced or they 're meaningless and should just be removed completely so everyone can be free to do whatever they feel like at any time as long as you get 50 % +1 vote , it 's all magically al right , even if you change your mind a year down the line , but then the right thing has changed again , since that 's what the polls say . 
  then why should the eu not apply the same principle and impose quotas on how much business swiss based companies can do in the eu ? 
  ( and this is n't it btw , just a suspension of talks on further agreements for the time being , which is the least any sane person would do given the development ), 
  if freedom of movement is an internal state issue , what is n't ? 
  or is freedom of movement for people an internal issue , but freedom of movement for capital , goods and services , and electricity is somehow different ? 
  how ? 
  hey , if switzerland can throw its treaty obligations out the window , so can the eu ... how is this anything other than common sense ? 
  or you renegotiate it as opposed to taking a fountain pen to it [ and going all * darth vader * on it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpe_xmricle ), 
  interestingly , [ it was the emptier parts of switzerland that said it . 
   `` the council expresses its conviction that this agreement does not constitute the final goal in eu-ukraine co-operation . '', 
  ... `` the words mean what they say , '' ashton told press . 
  this is rapidly aproaching game of thrones language . 
  i saw this on polandball yesterday and did n't know what to make of it . 
  what has my life come to when i 'm getting my news from polandball !, 
  can people please stop using the definite article in front of esa ? 
  ( now i know how ukrainians must feel ), 
   the statement was figurative and gives the message they wanted to send just fine no , it does n't . 
  a country and a house are two fundementally different things even inregards to the issue in question . 
  it 's a bad figurative statement . 
  sounds like an international agreement, 
  a country is n't a house - you do n't lock the borders at night or turn off the power grid when you leave god , populism is dumb, 
  it is n't how much money they 're investing , it 's how large a share, 
  there 's no such thing as illegal capital , only undocumented capital, 
  does anyone know what the process of invoking the guillotine clause would look like ? 
  does it involve a consensus vote in the council or a qualified majority or is it jut a commission prerogative ? 
  the commission has to get up on its hind legs on this one . 
  i mean they stood up to china , and they had merkel 's support at the time . 
  the word you were looking for is * insane . 
  the commission 's job is to safeguard the treaties . 
  this is a clear violation of treaty commitments . 
  if it does n't respond harshly here , then where ? 
   you ought to be able to improve treaties over time without the spectre of `` you 're gon na kill the entire eu '' hanging over your head . 
  true , but now is really the worst possible time for this . 
  with anti-eu parties on the rise and a possible brexit on the horizon , the above mentioned spectre is very real, 
  it takes two to start anew , maybe the other side does n't see a point in building a new framework which will simply be torn up at a random time in the future, 
  it 's also not required that a new agreement be negotiated after all , why bother if the other guy is just going to tear it up at his earliest convenience ? 
  because switzerland made certain commitments as part of a negotiated agreement and is now unilaterally changing that agreement into something that it finds more comfortable . 
  you ca n't do that !, 
  that would be the pragmatic thing to do , but there is a principle at stake here regarding '' * pick and choose * '' , which the commission is likely to defend with quite a hard line ... especially since , and please forgive the expression , switzerland makes for a convenient sacrificial lamb, 
  it 's clearly a decision for the swiss electorate , but i can still hold the opinion that they made a stupid decision - seeing as they did . 
  it 's one thing to negotiate a special set of terms for yourself while a treaty is being constructed . 
  it 's something quite different to sign a treaty , ratify it and then unilaterally back out of one provision which you do n't like because you do n't like it . 
  not if the eu axes schengen with switzerland, 
  open primaries - good closed primaries - tea party edit : come to think of it , open primaries are just a different way of having a two round election .

  extremism necessarily means `` not mainstream '' , and protectionism in the form of agricultural subsidies is very much mainstream . 
  you said supporting protectionism is an extremist position . 
  that would make literally every french politician an extremist in economic terms since agricultural subsidies are pretty much untouchable . 
  so do you consider macron to be an extremist ? 
  no , if hofer was president , he 'd be telling people how employing women is bad for business and how the society has become too feminised . 
  so much better . 
  they 'll be there regardless of what politicians do . 
  you did n't answer my question . 
  m\u00e9lenchon is very big on involving his voters in every decision he makes , he created his entire programme by collecting proposals from his supporters and letting his base vote on it . 
  i mean , when do people who already have issues with islam in europe not use every opportunity to push their agenda ? 
   benefits whom ? 
  the agricultural industry obvi  at what productivity ? 
  pretty irrelevant when discussing communist countries since full employment had higher priority than productivity under that system . 
   it is an extremist position to argue that big economies now will benefit from protectionist stances . 
  is macron opposed to agricultural subsidies ? 
  but his statement is specifically about how islamophobia affects hijabis . 
  he was responding to a pupil who said that she was against headscarves because wearing one made it more difficult for women to get a job . 
  he basically said that rather than making women take off headscarves , we should respect the right of women to choose what they wear . 
   it 's almost like when a terrorist attack happens , or a story about sexual assault or violence comes out , peoples views on islam and muslims get less and less tolerant . 
  very few if any of these incidents are committed by muslim women , so discrimination against women wearing headscarves ( which , not all muslim women wear one and not everyone wearing a headscarf is a muslim ) is completely irrational . 
   to what effect ? 
  full employment . 
   and what 's the most protectionist country out there ? 
  north korea ? 
  and what 's the most laissez-faire country out there ? 
  let 's not with the slippery slope arguments . 
   and you see the eu and us policies are successful ? 
  no , i find them to be incredibly harmful to developing countries . 
  my point is that pretending that protectionism has been universally rejected by the mainstream is clearly wrong . 
  countries use protectionism where it benefits them , and push tree trade where it benefits them . 
  acting like advocating for protectionism is some extremist position is just making you look foolish . 
   ( women have the right to dress however they like . 
  that 's what i have to say about it . 
  this applies not just to muslim women , every woman may wear a headscarf . 
  and if islamophobia continues to escalate as it has done , there will come a time when we will need to ask all women to wear one as a statement of solidarity towards those who wear it on religious grounds . ), 
  he sent out a survey to his supporters asking them whether they intend to support macron or abstain or spoil the ballot . 
  then he 'll publish the results on may 2 and if the result is pro-macron , he 'll endorse . 
   we 're talking about 2017 france . 
  we 're talking about the merits of protectionism in general , hence my bringing up developing countries . 
  but as far as the west is concerned , you only need to look as far as the eu and us agricultural policy to see that protectionism is still the rule of the game even in the west . 
  neoliberalism is n't just a right-wing thing . 
  french military expenditures are 0.2 percentage points below the nato guideline . 
  nobody makes military spending a central point of their programme because they want to fix what 's essentially a rounding error . 
   protectionism makes everybody poorer . 
  that 's really not true . 
  protectionist policies have been used to much success by developing nations to grow domestic industries and accumulate capital . 
  protectionism provides the necessary buffer until domestic industries are able to withstand foreign competition . 
  it 's very much a necessary step in an economy 's development . 
  is google banned where you are ? 
  libdems are the epitome of neoliberal ... 
   he is absolutely using `` dog whistle '' speech to appeal to these people at home ? 
  not really . 
  if anything he 's moving closer to eurasianism but he 's really not an ethnonationalist . 
  putin 's relationship with the russian far right is anything but cosy . 
  the 2011 alliance of the nationalists and the liberals was the only real challenge to his authority and it clearly scared him , which is why you more likely to find the ringleaders in penal colonies than in the streets today . 
  stuff like the nashi youth clubs have been portrayed as nationalist training camps in the west but are basically designed to sap support from the far right , not strengthen it . 
  there has been a clear ideological shift to the right during putin 's most recent term but much of it is due to the far right banding up together and deciding to use official channels to hijack policy ( e.g. 
  the izborsky club ) rather than putin being some mastermind that plays the far right like a fiddle . 
  if anything putin 's attitude is the same as his attitude to kadyrov : he sees it as a problem but openly confronting it would be more trouble than it 's worth so he turns a blind eye to it as long as it does n't threaten his position eta : deleted the duplicate, 
  i remember all the drama between this subreddit and r/european ( before it was quarantined ) and let me tell you , a blanket ban on everyone who posted over at r/european back then would have been more than justified . 
  were there people in r/european that were n't ultra-racist shitstains ? 
  possibly , i do n't know their lives . 
  but you ca n't deny that that sub as a whole was racist as fuck and simply banning everyone from there would have made late 2015/early 2016 on this sub about a 548790976452 % percent less tiring . 
  i do n't know the whole backstory with r/offmychest and r/tumblrinaction but sometimes people from a certain sub persistently cause drama until it gets to a point where it 's just easier to shut the gates completely . 
  especially in a sub that 's created to be drama-free . 
  r/tumblrinaction and r/kotakuinaction are drama subreddits the sole purpose of which is to mock people and stir shit , whereas / r/offmychest is a subreddit created to let people unload their feelings without being mocked . 
  like sure , perhaps a couple people have a legitimate interest in posting to both without going against the spirit of the sub , but most of the time , the ban keeps assholes out of a place that 's explicitly designed as an asshole-free zone .

  all this really shows is that highly competitive environments mean more anxiety , which ... anyone could 've told you that . 
  [ they are , actually ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-04-19/french-election-shocker-pollsters-baffled-by-four-way-contest ) - online polling has become more reliable than telephone surveys because telephone surveys now have up to 95 % non-response rate .

  benito mussolini , 1920 :  when dealing with such a race as slavic - inferior and barbarian - we must not pursue the carrot , but the stick policy / ... / we should not be afraid of new victims / ... / i would say we can easily sacrifice 500,000 barbaric slavs for 50,000 italians . 
  benito mussolini , 1941 :  when ethnicity does not accord with geography , it is the ethnic group that must be moved . 
  population exchanges and forced exodus of people are providential , because such transfers result in political frontiers that coincide with racial groups general mario robotti , 1942 :  we are not killing enough !, 
  / ... / we should not limit ourselves solely to internment . 
  i would not be opposed to all slovenes being interned and replaced by italians . 
  in other words , we should take steps to ensure that political and ethnic frontiers coincide . 
  general mario roatta , 1942 :  at whatever cost italian domination and prestige must be restored , even if all slovenes have to be shot and slovenia destroyed . 
  [ while we 're on the subject of roatta ] ( http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1354571042000254746 ) :  in january 1943 , in preparation of a large german-planned mopping-up expedition dubbed operation weiss , roatta issued orders , now without any effort of concealment , that all males of 18 years and over , if found in operation zones , were to be shot ` on the spot ' ; all other civilians in these areas would be arrested and sent to concentration camps and their houses burnt to the ground . 
  roatta had embraced the notion of collective guilt and random punishment that left individual responsibility totally out of the equation of justice . 
  you can choose to believe whatever you want , but slovenes will always remember rab , gonars , risiera di san sabba , the bazovica four , the deportations of tens of thousands , the summary executions and the barb wire around ljubljana , just like the montenegrins will always remember biroli 's `` 50 dead for every italian '' orders , the greeks will always remember the domenikon massacre and the ethiopians will always remember the hundred thousand gassed by badoglio , yekatit 12 , danane and nocra .

  thanks for the laugh, 
  that does n't make it a far-right regime . 
  putin 's regime is n't far-right , it 's basically the same blend of social conservatism , political illiberalism and relative economic liberalism ( with the corruption that comes with having an oil-based economy ) that you find all over central asia and the mena region . 
   he still made the right choice for the country and took a stand against fascism . 
  fillon cares so much about standing up to fascism that he got sens commun to endorse macron . 
  oh wait , that did n't happen . 
  it 's almost like the endorsement was just a political nicety . 
  the eu ca n't force spain to bring the case before a european court . 
  you can bring the case before a eu court after you 've exhausted your legal appeals at home , which is the job of this lady 's legal counsel , not some guy in brussels . 
  the rich contribute less to society per every euro in income than everyone else . 
  they consume less per every euro in income ( which means they pay less in vat and other indirect taxes ) . 
  the french economy is driven by domestic consumption , so cutting welfare expenditures adversely affects economic growth ( because the main consumers have less money to spend ) whereas taxing the income of the top tax bracket spurs economic growth because a ) redistributing money to lower tax brackets means more consumption and b ) progressive taxation encourages the rich to actually invest their money rather than sit on it .

   the only country ( real country , not that micronation bullshit ) in the eu that 's smaller is cyprus .

  if merkel wants more immigrants in germany - and the german people agree with that - she can have them . 
  but let us `` bigots '' alone . 
  they do have some of that in our stores , but i do n't know how many people buy it . 
  most people i know think those kinds of diets are stupid and i 'm one of them . 
   black molds growing inside and around the chernobyl nuclear power plant we really are curious beings : a black mold forms in a highly irradiated area and someone still goes and picks at it .

   he added : `` we have lost the ability to talk about religious belief because of a century of secular assumptions , and most religious belief is either highly visible and we do n't recognise it , or it 's invisible and we miss it entirely . '' one would think that this secular nature would be perfect for discussing religion . 
  we have overcome past conflicts and achieved a union where catholics , protestants , orthodox christians , agnostics , non-believers and believers in other faiths can live their lives without conflict but it is apparent that one religion stands out with its inability to acclimate to our civilisation . 
  one can see that our secular society is not a problem . 
  should we change our lifestyles to accomodate those who do not live the same way we do or rather stand up for ourselves and make it clear that we will not change our ways ? 
  ukraine has a fine new national park - just do n't forget to bring the geiger counter . 
  but seriously , i 'm sure there are many things that can be observed from this unique environment . 
  sweeping generalisations would not be necessary if the situation was handled correctly when it started . 
  the posts on here will be the least of anyone 's worries when the political climate reaches the boiling point . 
  hungary is doing what it can to save itself . 
  maybe if other european countries showed some support instead of empty moralism , something could be done . 
  the only indecent behavior is the one coming from berlin and vienna ; on one hand , they criticise hungary for taking care of their own problem and on the other hand they act in a similar way when their country is at stake . 
  yes , it most certainly will . 
  it has been going on for more than a decade now ( london , madrid , charlie hebdo , the foiled terrorist attack on the train in belgium this summer , ... ) and will only become more prominent as more and more dubious characters come from syria . 
  remember that many anti-assad soldiers have escaped to europe already , and if the russian intervention bears any fruit , more will most likely come . 
  i was mainly thinking about islamic terrorism . 
  i do n't know how much truth there is to the idea that isis has been sending its agents to europe but what is true is the fact that other radical ( more or less ) islamists have already been living in europe for years now ; the number will only increase as more immigrants come here . 
  many of the people fleeing here did so because they were part of anti-assad forces - and those range from moderate ( with or without apostrophes ) to more radical individuals . 
  weapons will not be a problem for them as the last few months have shown . 
  on the other hand , the rising number of people of cultures , alien to europe , will lead ( and has already lead ) to an increase in attacks by certain europeans of radical right beliefs . 
  this is a reaction to the rising immigration rates as well as the general european political climate which has not done enough to control the flow into europe . 
  as long as the situation does n't change dramatically , we can expect more and more attacks from both sides , but one thing is clear : to end both kinds of terrorism , we will have to acknowledge that multiculturalism and unrestrained immigration realistically do not work and are dealt with . 
  this uncontrolled , unlimited immigration will lead to more terrorist attacks like that , except on this side of the mediterranean . 
  most of my posts are made on this very subreddit and a large part of threads on here are about immigration . 
  i am concerned about my country and our wider `` neighborhood '' that is the european union . 
  what problem do you have with that ? 
  if a serious effort was made , the near east could be pacified completely in a short time . 
  but that obviously is n't in the interest of certain powers . 
   you 're on an agenda and you 're not ? 
  come on , just admit it . 
  or do n't ; putin will take care of your `` moderate islamists '' soon enough . 
  it would n't be a problem to keep them living together if they were forced to return home as soon as that was possible . 
  i do n't understand why anyone is of the idea that these people should stay in europe . 
  that 's because they 're treating refugees as just that . 
  one day , they will have to return back home , whether they like it or not . 
  how would you like if huge masses of people started moving towards tunisia ? 
  edit : i hovered over your flag and i now see why it 's not a big deal to you . 
  the last poll showed that three quarters of slovenia 's population wants a stricter control on the borders and more than half do n't want more than a thousand staying here . 
  more than half want them gone as soon as possible . 
  assimilation is n't really a question here because most just want the immigrants gone . 
  hopefully , our government will hear us . 
  i do n't see why anyone has problems with this . 
  croatia is not part of schengen yet , so there obviously has to be some control over who crosses the border into the schengen area . 
  yes , i understand that official minorities are n't assimilated ( because then they would n't be minorities ) , but they 're a special case . 
  one of diamond 's arguments for a faster development of civilisations in europe and north africa is the fact that sub-saharan africa had no domesticable animals , so i pasted the link to a picture of lord walter rothschild , who seemed to debunk that idea . 
  anyway , that 's not my only problem with the book - and not neccesarily the biggest one . 
  the main idea behind the book is that geography is the biggest factor in determining which civilisation will prosper and which will fail . 
  according to diamond , it 's all just pure luck . 
  is n't that part of assimilation , though ? 
  and national minorities are different because they have special right that protect them . 
  it would n't be wise to give those to the first group that shouts loud enough , because we might as well say goodbye to the nation state then . 
  so what do you propose is done with someone who does n't want to say where he is from ? 
  indefinite stay in europe on taxpayers ' money ? 
  not if the borders get closed before enough can come . 
  and even if it ever comes to that , i am sure every european country has a capable police force and army . 
  the only way to introduce any foreign element into a country is through assimilation , which can only be possible if the foreigners are not present in a too high number and not concentrated in an isolated area . 
  and unless it 's forced , assimilation does n't work if the people getting assimilated do n't want to cooperate . 
  as i 've said , they would probably tell where they come from so they would be deported there instead of an inhospitable place such as antarctica . 
  if anyone did n't ... well , i guess that 's his problem , then . 
  all of the immigrants are obviously not one monolithic group but even our media - which blocked most online discussions on the immigrant crisis and has been very good at filming primarily women and children - filmed immigrants complaining about things . 
  i am not an expert on human nature but i am pretty sure that the usual response to someone offering help is to thank him , not complain and demand more and better support . 
  i do n't see how death penalty is connected to expulsion . 
  the problem is that they even dared to complain . 
  i personally can not imagine to escape from war , receive food , clothing and shelter - and still complain . 
  if they wanted five star hotels , they would 've come here the legal way . 
  that still does n't mean they have to complain . 
  they 're acting more like they 're on vacation rather than escaping a war zone . 
  found this map from wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:global_prevalence_of_consanguinity.svg and i also found this book : https://books.google.si/books?id=t6cscxxe8skc&amp;pg=pa23&amp;lpg=pa23&amp;dq=islam+cousin+marriage+rates&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vltuynfdsh&amp;sig=8p2lkeij7an7y2xyrs80d1herni&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ceyq6aewbzgkahukewiiq6ociqfiahwdxswkhefkbrm#v=onepage&amp;q=islam%20cousin%20marriage%20rates&amp;f=false, 
  i just used an example that i was familiar with because i first read about high marriage rates among first cousins in pakistan . 
  while it may or may not be in the near east , pakistan - just like the * majority * of the countries in the near east - is majority muslim . 
  and as far as i know , other muslims countries also have problems with disorders in children of first cousins . 
   just like the majority of middle-eastern ones i did n't say israel was defined by islamic culture ( although about one quarter of its population is muslim , so islam is still present ) . 
  they would most definitely not come if they knew they would get shot . 
  not defending shooting people , but i got to admit it would probably be a deterrent . 
  semantics . 
  pakistan 's society is muslim , just like the majority of middle-eastern ones . 
  no , i 'm just saying that he is n't completely wrong because incest-related disorders are more of a problem in islamic societies than in other societies due to in-marrying . 
  no , mental retardation is not the only defect that can appear as result of incest . 
  i do n't think that your scenario is very realistic . 
  nobody would come to europe if he knew people were getting shot for entering illegally . 
  to think that anyone would come and fight ( except for terrorists ) is just absurd . 
  he is not wrong . 
  in pakistan , as many as 50 % of marriages are said to be between first cousins . 
   guns , germs and steel one picture is enough to debunk that book : http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kfkhnagxs9c/t_tu0orjvbi/aaaaaaaacde/ld_b9q9r7wk/s1600/lord-rothschild-zebra-carriage-490_107554_1.jpeg, 
  if they wo n't tell , they should be threatened with expulsion to antarctica . 
  i 'm sure their mouths will start running as soon as they hear that . 
  i would pick my heritage . 
  things may get worse for us , but our ancestors did not live the most comfortable lives themselves . 
  anything else would be a cop out and a betrayal of everything that our ancestors lived , fought and died for . 
  we do n't need immigration to survive ; if my people survived through the plague , turkish raids and all of the wars , i do n't see why we could n't survive a lower birth rate . 
  my way of thinking is how it has always been . 
  outsiders came to our lands in big numbers in the past and that lead to conflict . 
  the last time it happened in a major way was the second world war , but it was an issue later and still is .

  you can ask the social services to pay the bills for you though . 
  and they do . 
  they cover all the nesessary and basic bills . 
  you 're also exampt from paying into the national health system and the `` extra '' health system . 
  you have to be active at seeking a job . 
  at my last work , a woman who was getting a minimum wage said she will not try to seek a job anymore because life with a minimum wage is not any better than living on benefits . 
  edit : if you do a certain amount of hours per week of volounteer work , you can get extra 150 $ a month in benefits . 
  be careful .

  even [ so\u010da ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/so%c4%8da ) reaches those temperatures in summer and it 's considered super cold . 
   15-20 degrees o_o we do n't consider sea swimmable until it 's at least 20 \u00b0 c. 
  it usually gets to around 25 \u00b0 c and during a heat wave it can get up to almost 30 . 
  quite popular in slovenia . 
  we have 2 kinds of scouts . 
  `` taborniki '' , that roughly translate to `` campers '' and `` skavti '' who are a catholic version and are based on robert baden-powell scout movement . 
  but you do n't have to be catholic to join skavti . 
  according to `` taborniki union '' webpage , 20 % of slovenians are or were once members of the union and skavti webpage says they have around 4500 members .

  i have never heard people reciting bible verses or mentioning god in everyday life like they do in the us . 
  i think majority of church goers have never even read the bible .

  people were enraged . 
  but what exactly counts as christian conservative over there ? 
  edit : [ this group of people ] ( https://www.facebook.com/za-otroke-gre-646841078755940/ ) can be considered christian conservatives i guess . 
  they mostly fight againts gay people 's right to adopt . 
  mostly with lies . 
  exactly . 
  countries he cycled through are n't exactly known for their human rights records . 
  yea , i guess shop owners can always claim they just like toads . 
  i still think something needs to be done about it . 
  lol if you 're that guy that someone linked in another post that cycled from netherlands to singapore , that 's a bit weird comming from you . 
  how is that legal ? 
  why do n't local authorities do something about it ? 
  i think it 's quite terrible : /, 
  iud is free here . 
  that 's all i know . 
  not sure if it would be free for someone not from slovenia . 
  i think it depends on your insurance company , if they 're willing to pay for it . 
  i know an italian woman had an abortion here a few months ago because it was past xx weeks that they allow in italy , but whether she had to pay or not , i do n't know . 
  edit : i do n't know how national insurance works in italy , but over here if it 's not free here , they 're not gon na pay for you to have it done somewhere else . 
  if the treatment is not available but there are other options with same results , they 're not gon na pay . 
  if the treatment is not available here and it 's crucial for your well being , they 're gon na pay . 
  so if italian national insurance is anything like ours , you 're out of luck . 
  but iud is not expensive anyway . 
  some schools offer it as a 3rd foreign language among others like french , spanish and italian . 
  i noticed some schools , especially elementary schools are now also offering chinese or japanese . 
  not a lot , a few . 
  when i enrolled to high school i actually signed up for a `` russian class '' which ment we 'd get russian as a 3rd foreign language instead of informatics in 2nd year . 
  idk what happened , but we did n't get it at the end . 
  russian is not very popular . 
  most that decide to learn it , learn it for business reasons . 
  as for your side question , as a holiday destination , not popular at all . 
  never heard anyone say they 're going to russia for holidays . 
  backpacking through russia is more popular , especially transiberian railway , but i think caucasus and - stan countries are more popular . 
  looks similar yes . 
  eastern part in slovenia has traditional potato \u017eganci , called d\u00f6doli . 
  but they 're not made like strapachka . 
  she 's played by keisha castle-hughes , i remember her from whale rider . 
  no idea what that is , it looks just like polenta . 
  also , blood sausages are found in lots of countries . 
  they 're just made of different ingredients . 
  i think most countries use pig blood but they use different grain . 
  some use rice , some barley , some buckwheat ...

  i would disagree with poor condition of our cycling paths . 
  have you seen it in other countries ? 
  there may not be as good and as plenty as those in denmark and netherlands but are far from bad . 
  they are a copy-paste denmark model . 
  as for lack of daily cyclers - it 's kind of difficult to cycle to work every day when you live quite a few km 's from the city with plenty of hills inbetween . 
  slovenia has a more rural population than a lot of other countries , which means cycling to work is not really an option .

  chicken laws ? 
  does any country have chicken laws ? 
  lol ? 
  i live in an apartment building in a city and people who live in a house next to my building have chickens .

  lucky for slovenia soros is already doing it with his ngos :  politics :  goals  1 . 
  to include turkey in our eu/wb enlargement projects . 
  visa liberalization for kosovo and for turkey .

  it 's me being flippant about non integrated multikulti society . 
  yes , very shocked . 
  brussels did 9.11 . , right ? 
  scroll to the bottom of the page , on the right side under : in partnership with , also krytyka polityczna is his organization . 
  i am beyond shocked , he seemed like such a nice guy . 
  it has to be so otherwise soros 's open society foundations would n't be paying for it . 
  also a lot of top universities , and school results of migrants are off the charts . 
  islamisation will be fun !, 
  how big was your delegation to rio ? 
  what kind of a punishment would he receive if he did n't have diplomatic immunity - since he is a minor . 
  and luckily a lot of unaccompanied children from iraq migrate to eu every day . 
  and then we are even more blessed when they are reunited with their families . 
  i have great doubts if this is indeed halal . 
  does france brake those statistics by religion ? 
  i wish to see how racist are the french to the muslims . 
  this is disgusting . 
  female genital mutilation is the way to go . 
  this country will self destruct not being in the eu , and not having euro . 
  how much they could benefit by outsourcing their decisions to honest & competent public servants in brussels . 
  he will have a captive audience . 
  great football players , also basketball ... 
  because the same countries that do n't give a shit about what happens to the economies of the peripheral europoor countries , will gladly go to war for them . 
  brussels did 9/11 . 
  what 's wrong with racism , seems to be working for israel . 
  you ( i am assuming you are israeli ) can always stop profiting from the african diamonds - and leave them to africans , and you can stop selling them arms . 
  my hats off to you . 
  * have to agree with you . 
  i 'm assuming you are also somalian . 
  yes , nato pakistan . 
  jump-start the emigration process , have to do zero paper-work , get free accommodation while you learn the language , plan a family when you get out - now you have english relatives -- sit back and relax while the tax payers pay for you . 
  when should we start worrying that a nuclear country is going sharia ? 
  if not , how about putin , or isis ?

  could you explain `` having control over the german economy ? '', 
  what about spain - their `` books showed reality , '' how many billions did they save ? 
  you mean like accepting common currency ... and saving billions ? 
  are you f-ing kidding me . 
  fix greece first , then and only then should the brussels bozos be allowed an army , so that we can go around spreading freedom , federation and lebensraum for german companies . 
  do you with fuck mean give him free money , and let him make a fool out of our most glorious federalising union . 
  or else ? 
  maybe irish people need to be less flippant about uk leaving , or will the exports to uk , be offset with more tax fraud on the rest of eu . 
  dude , where is siemens mobile ? 
  how about chinese huawei , zte , xiaomi . 
   according to the rules , the fine can be up to 0.2 percent of the country 's gdp and the suspension of commitments or payments from the structural funds up to 0.5 percent . 
  but the commission can propose them to be equal to zero . 
  hint : they do n't have the german currency . 
  what 's next , african union giving us advice ? 
  sure , why not move to nigeria then . 
  good points . 
  i am still anti burqa , niqab ... 
  to rob a bank . 
  so you have joined him in `` simplifying to the point of the text being merely a poorly constructed rant '' except that you are pro eugoslavia . 
  as a ex-yugoslavian i would strongly disagree about lack of a precedent , and you may want to talk to any number of periphery countries about their economic ... 
  so you are against brainwashing people with viable `` nationalism , '' and want fantasy `` europeanism . '', 
  which is kind of interesting , you coming form an ex soviet satellite where they tried to build :  ** the new soviet man ** or new soviet person ( russian : \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a novy sovetsky chelovek ) , as postulated by the ideologists of the communist party of the soviet union , was an archetype of a person with certain qualities that were said to be emerging as dominant among all citizens of the soviet union , irrespective of the country 's cultural , ethnic , and linguistic diversity , creating a single soviet people , soviet nation . 
  glad to see that we do n't learn from history !, 
  and this time its different . 
  what do you expect us to do - realize that all the peripheral europoor countries are merely vassal states meant to keep the euro down , and provide educated and cheep workforce for germany . 
  and that france is one recession away from being italy , which is one recession away from being greece ? 
  so kind sir - let us enjoy brexit , and let us forget about our problems , and let us demonize britain and let us continue with our glorious federalization . 
  we are made weak by time and fate , but strong in self delusion . 
  he could also be a little pissed . 
  sorry but this has to be down voted . 
  ca n't have europoors questioning why the same is n't happening here . 
  vw did nothing wrong . 
  not really . 
  but i apologized . 
  what 's the point of this vitriol ? 
  how are the two related ?? 
  is this tread becoming a pro eu cult ? 
  this is my tl ; dr ( stuff in brackets is my speculation ) but we must also acknowledge that ** support and passion for our common project has faded ** over the last decade in parts of our societies . 
  france and germany remain most firmly of the belief that the european union provides a unique and indispensable framework for the ** pursuit of freedom , prosperity and security ** in europe , for shaping peaceful ... ** we will therefore move further towards political union in europe and invite the other europeans to join us in this endeavour . 
  ** looking back at the history of the european edifice , we strongly believe in the strength of the eu and its ability to overcome these situations . 
  but something is new in these critical times , namely the perception that these crises jeopardise the very fabric of our societies , our values , our way of life .

  thise were fucking * hated * . 
  both serbs and croats took them as an attempt to break up their national unity . 
  those were the least controversial ones . 
  the whole area was [ ethnically mixed ] ( http://www.jugosloveni.info/mape_jugoslavije/images/etnicka_struktura_jugoslavije_po_opstinama.jpg ) , so internal borders that followed ethnic lines would be pretty much impossible . 
  on the other hand , old weird borders had some air of legitimacy , and attempts to change them in royal yugoslavia caused a lot of resentment , so yeah . 
   they had different circumstances under ottomans , iirc got their independence differently ? 
  it can be said they were never conquered properly . 
  udba was , quite literally , killing terrorists . 
  guys who kidnapped planes , killed ambassadors , set bombs in cinemas , such stuff . 
  pow 's immediately after the war . 
  just too damn big . 
  some of them crumbled immediately ( tam ) , some took their sweet time collapsing ( peko , elan ) and some are doing just fine ( gorenje , revoz , lek ) . 
  fix up the judiciary , streamline the regulations and enforce them properly . 
  that 's all i really find lacking . 
  with an added bonus : i can praise the * other * government and watch the rage build up . 
  two passports , two citizenships , two electoral rights and two languages spoken with a slightly weird accent :3, 
  never !, 
  i 'm ready to die for my lack of ideals !, 
  you mean , back when general glanzkopf was busy fighting tycoons , buying tanks and taking out loans left and right ? 
  as for people , it 's all lack of experience . 
  dude , you 're being trolled so hard i 'm cringing for you . 
  the latter . 
  while croats did always complain about lazy easterners leeching them off , the biggest issue was that croatia was ( based on bad experiences with first yugoslavia and hungary before that ) really paranoid about losing its national autonomy and identity . 
  the heavy-handed centralization attempts by milo\u0161evi\u0107 's wing poured a barrel of fuel on this spark . 
  does that mean i 'm in the minority again ? 
  just great . 
  the thing is , if slovenia started with the privatization immediately in 1991 , it would lead to massive robbery and economical collapse from which we still would n't have recovered ( check , for example , croatia ) . 
  so this approach , although it was very far from perfect and only made the 2007 financial crisis worse for us , was actually the most sensible thing to do at that time . 
  now , about the people being stupid and falling for empty promises ... can you really blame them ? 
  they were their own bosses for the first time in a millennium , and the last regime was communist , which is known to kinda infantilize the population .

  ah yeah , just like [ good old days ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/cenzurisane_radni%c4%8dke_novine_1920.jpg/440px-cenzurisane_radni%c4%8dke_novine_1920.jpg ) . 
   one of the children ( usually a son ) often stays at home and is then responsible for taking care of the parents as they grow older . 
  sometimes one of the children , if ( s ) he has a house , even brings his/her parents to live with them , usually on the upper floor . 
  the thing is , i live away from my parents for at least five days a week . 
  i wash my own clothes , i make my own food . 
  but if they asked me if i still live with them , i 'd have to say yes . 
  their address is still on my id , i still go back to them at least two weekends a months , and i 'm still financially dependent on them . 
   lingua franca yeah we know , we 've seen the op . 
   i believe lending words from other languages is pretty common . 
  fellows of institute for slovenian language just let out a collective gasp . 
  [ always relevant ] ( https://xkcd.com/123/ ), 
  let 's not forget the meteoritic rise and fall of social democrats in 2008-11 , as well as these parties being staffed with roughly the same people who switch just in time for elections . 
  seriously , look a bit into the history of the 4th republic . 
  france with proportional system is an ungovernable mess . 
   young hitler was a member of communistic party [ citation needed ]  mussolini was fascinated with communism , not socialism . 
  except he was a member of the italian socialist party and turned to extreme nationalism way before communism and socialism could be clearly distinguished . 
  mussolini was a socialist , not communist . 
  and where did you get the idea hitler was ever a commie ? 
  well , yeah , but i do n't think they would be able to defeat nazi germany without usa . 
  ( also , uk and france are at fault for the war not being won in 1940 . ), 
  i 'm not sure if uk did more in that field than usa . 
  do you know if there 's any place i could check that ? 
   there were also conflicts about other questions .

  this might bring out the flamethrowers , but as a slovenian i can sympathize with catalans very much . 
  and this is why i support compulsory public school education for lower levels . 
  schools are as much about education as they are about raising future citizens . 
  canada obviously because i 'm an atheist woman and morocco would n't be the greatest country for me to live in .

  i was looking over some news articles and this popped up . 
  now i 'm looking for the longer version of this interview/opinion piece .

  according to monsanto their peer reviewed , good laboratory practice glyphosate is [ perfectly safe , presenting little to no impact on humans and the environment ] ( http://www.monsanto.com/glyphosate/pages/glyphosate-frequently-asked-questions.aspx ) . 
  / sarcasm edit : formatting snafu, 
  given that it 's geared towards americans some religion and sex questions are pretty insane for a vast majority of europeans . 
  so most of us would land left since religious christian fundamentalist represent the social conservatists . 
  ca n't remember the last time premarital sex was a serious moral issue to be discussed in the political arena . 
  pretty much as expected : economic left/right : -4.63 social libertarian/authoritarian : -4.51 given the religious and sex portions it 's clear that it 's geared towards americans . 
  ca n't remember the last time premarital sex , sex education or anything in that vein was even mentioned as a political issue . 
  slovenia = the same as slovakia ? 
  you 've never been to our [ fair part of the world ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/agriculture/agricultural-machinery/tractors/per-capita ) ... 
  i think the major difference that back then it was known where the people are from and there was a somewhat finite number of them . 
  today we do n't know where this people are from , except that most of them are n't syrians . 
  and there no comprehensible end number , it 's arguably - in comparison - a quarter of continent and not a single ex country on the move if things get bad . 
  and , yes , it does n't help that it is also a group with far different values , culture and language than back then . 
  i think you misunderstood me . 
  i 'm not sure the dem even * want * to scale back military spending , however it is what they say in speeches . 
  because it makes for a convenient scape goat for budgetary issues . 
  if you look at the graph the usa public spending is nominally greater than most world countries and yet the people get much less coverage from the government . 
  tbh imho this is a speech obama gave for voters back home . 
  as a diplomatic outreach this kind of language is completely tone deaf and can only lead to alienation of the general public in ally states . 
  the way i see it , the left has been blaming the large military budget for pretty much everything . 
  but since they 're not shrinking it they have to find an excuse for their inaction somewhere . 
  much easier than explaining to the public why [ usa is far outspending everyone on healthcare ] ( http://gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/health_financing/atlas.html ) and yet [ infant mortality remains a challenge ] ( http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/93/3/14-148627/en/ ) ( and higher than that of iran , turkey and libya ) . 
  the [ actual money put in by the government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita#/media/file:oecd-healthexp-percapita.svg ) is pretty high with poor results . 
  besides i highly , * highly * , doubt that european countries fielding armies with larger arsenals would make us in anyway shrink their own budget . 
  in worst case scenario you would have pundits pushing it even higher ` just in case ' . 
  kill everyone and there will be peace . 
  the best defense ever !,

  to be good `` raw '' the sauerkraut has to be homemade and chilled ( cellar temp ) in my opinion . 
  store-bought can be unimpressive , and in that case a pig stepping in it while it cooks is a must . 
  my grandma makes it every fall , you can eat it out of the souring bin as is and it 's delicious . 
  poor word choice on my part . 
  more in the sense of heaven being the true home so keep your head down and suffer what you 're given in this life because it 's just a test . 
  i 've read some older sermons and they 're pretty heavy on proper order of people ( kings are god 's chosen and the pope confirms them , people are the sheep that * need * protection from the nobility and state ( dogs ) and guidance from the church ( the shepherds ) or the wolves - devil - will tear them apart ) . 
  any problems - war , famine , disease - are punishments from above for general wickedness and sinfulness , so it can only be taken away by the grace of god if the people repent and pray enough ( and purge the unrepented from the herd ) . 
  i think it took away agency from people being told there 's ultimately * nothing * they can do to help their situation and even if they could they really kinda should n't anyway because this their lot in life assigned as an entry test to the heaven . 
  i think the end times rhetoric got severely toned down in the 20th century as the church tries to portray a more pr friendly face filled with hope and sunshine . 
  they even approve of science and evolution now , with a few caveats of course . 
  not to mention impeding education and discovery . 
  leaving healing and medicine in the hands of god , rapture is around the corner so why even bother improving this flawed world we temporarily inhabit before going home . 
  only if it 's organized by an international committee with the cooperation of ec and eea representatives to elect an unbiased format and fair moderators .

  around here there an opposite sentiment - our privacy laws on internet use are arguably stricter , because our former civil rights attache mrs. pirc-musar was a privacy hound . 
  the eu laws are often considered too invasive . 
  for instance your carrier may not retain any information of your internet traffic without specific court intervention in cooperation with police . 
  to counter that , i love homemade cider . 
  some of my relatives make hectoliters of the stuff - some apple , some pear - most of the trees are old , the fruits kinda blah to eat , but drinks out of them be it cider or schnapps is wonderful . 
  however , store-bought cider is ** terrible ** the added sweeteners make it pretty much unbearable for me - especially when flavored whatever . 
  this is great , since we know so little about the other `` teachers '' to the romans compared to ancient greeks . 
  true , it 's more of a comment on the creators . 
  for instance in case of enclaves mainly german ones where proposed to get a degree of autonomy , while others were more likely to be included in the greater territory . 
  mainly it would be a hodge-podge of a federation since there would probably be some unrest in the smaller older entities that would find themselves divided and under a new buffer between them and vienna . 
  well , op decided slovenia = carniola kinda , forget styria , istria , carinthia , ... 
  well ... not exactly behind the iron curtain but in slovenia there was a more than 500 years old enclave of ko\u010devje or gottschee germans . 
  hitler decided to make the land german again ( there 's a speach about it when he visited maribor ) and resettled them all over by taking the land ( generally by deportation ) from ethnic slovenes . 
  when the war was over , the new regime was somewhat murderous in it 's thirst for revenge . 
  there 's no german enclave in ko\u010devje nowadays .

but of course , why would n't there be ? 
  if eastern europe is a land of frequent ethnic tensions , where old grudges give rise to new atrocities , as conventional wisdom dictates , why would n't there be ethic tensions between eastern europeans and turks ? 
  after all , for the entire early modern period and part of the late modern period , the ottomans were the antagonists of eastern europe , a foreign empire seeking to subjugate the people of eastern europe . 
  the turks are the antagonists of our folk tales , from king mathias to martin krpan , we are taught from an early age that the turks raided and pillaged their way across our lands , kidnapping young boys to train into janissary soldiers , who they send out to do the same . 
  the very land itself has been shaped by the conflict with the turks . 
  markets were allowed to build defensive walls to defend against the ottoman raids . 
  in maribor , we have an entire section of the city ( tabor ) named after where suleiman the magnificent and his army made camp when they unsuccessfully besieged the city in 1532 . 
  we have a story about that as well about a little shoemaker who saved the city by flooding a moat and drowning the turkish sappers trying to mine through the wall . 
  then the german nation will be doomed to never rise again to the heights of the past . 
  this germany in name only will be ripped apart by its neighbouring central european countries in a post-eu europe . 
  ultimately , i think germany could fracture into several independent states . 
  after all , without the concept of a german nation , regional identity will return . 
  is that all ? 
  honor dictates you walk in their blood . 
  knee deep !, 
  in all honestly , this is very , very good news . 
  the uk is safer for it . 
  what is even our most upvoted image ? 
  a picture of our own flag ? 
  if they are lumped together with other asylum seekers , such an identification could prove dangerous . 
  they should be granted seperate housing for their own safety . 
  i have n't felt this much hope in ages . 
  it would n't be the first time the americans have come to our aid to defend europe from a clear and present threat . 
  coincidentally , germany was to blame for that as well . 
  that may be so , but these are desperate times . 
  and in such times , you really are n't in a position to be picky with your allies . 
  our history is a history of opposing forces making compromises and unlikely alliances against a common threat . 
  such groups rising in power is no surprise . 
  the last few years have seen a wellspring of nationalism across the eu . 
  in the interest of presenting a united front and further defusing the migrant crisis , i think the threat of radical identitarianism should be addressed at a later date . 
  it poses no real threat , merely piggybacking off the rise in nationalism . 
  imagine my shock . 
  honestly , i approve of this . 
  if the eu is unable or unwilling to stop these migrant ships , it is up to the various member states or ngos such as this one to take matters into their own hands . 
  if we have ngos patrolling the libyan coast and essentially ferrying migrants across the mediterranean , we sure as hell should have ngos blocking those ngos and diverting migrant boats . 
  i would too , honestly . 
  but they do n't see us as better . 
  and if our demographics are drastically altered , if these foreign cultures and religions uproot the native ones , we wo n't be remembered as such . 
  we will be remembered as the romans , advanced culturally and scientifically , but but decried as pagans , whose culture fell because it was inferior to the then prevailing culture . 
  that will be our legacy . 
  do you think isis supporters see us as better when they pass through our open borders to infect the minds of youths ? 
  do you think the people smugglers see us as better ? 
  are we even better if we fail in the and those we consider worse succeed ? 
  they have brought a war to our doorstep , and war does n't decide who is right or wrong , but who is left . 
  honor is useless when you are the only one who acts honorably . 
  you ca n't have your cake and eat it too . 
  i can tell you this much . 
  our history is filled with tales of terrorists and dictators . 
  of strong leaders , be they monarchs , elected officials or military commanders . 
  of freedom fighters , partisans and heroic outlaws . 
  some times freedoms are curtailed to ensure stability , sometimes the people take up arms and commit acts of unimaginable terror to their fellow man . 
  we are only pretending to be better , but in the end , we are n't better , and we are n't worse either . 
  we are just different . 
  it will be if we continue on our present course . 
  and i do n't want us to come to that . 
  close our doors to the migrants , or at the very least all but actual refugees . 
  put them in refugee camps and return them to syria when assad inevitably returns to power . 
  blockade the libyan coast and turn away any boat trying to cross the sea , with force if necessary . 
  sooner or later they will get the message . 
  and if not , well , that 's darwinism for you . 
  i would n't expect the same kindness from half of the countries from where these migrants originate . 
  why should we be any better ? 
  for if we continue at our present course , eventually we will lose the very things that make us better . 
  our respect for the individual , our enlightened values . 
  in the end , history will remember us not as the better party , but as the weaker one . 
  what is considered `` ethical '' is subject to interpretation . 
  i personally find it unethical and irresponsible to allow these foreigners to cross into the schengen . 
  a world without borders is utopian . 
  in the end , humans are animals , and nations , countries with borders , are our habitats , our cages , our pens . 
  what we have here in europe is just a much bigger pen , and now we are seeing what happens when the pen gate is n't shut . 
  the predators get in , and the food starts running scarce . 
  that pen ceases to exist and returns to the wild . 
  that is what a world without borders is , and a country or union that does not enforce its borders or has a weak immigration policy is just as bad . 
  order and rule of law , safety and security , those things i consider of greater importance that the lives of hundreds of thousands of faceless strangers undertaking a perilous journey to countries they consider lands of plenty , that in most cases do not want them and can not care for them in the long run . 
  it may be unethical to leave people in the freezing water clawing at the lifeboat , begging to be let aboard , but when the boat reaches its capacity , you can either submit to your compassion and doom not only yourself , but all of the other occupants , or you take up the paddle , you empty yourself of all compassion , everything that makes you a good person and in that moment , be the person you need to be to survive and start swinging . 
  then the german constitution is flawed and should be revised . 
  i would to be honest , but that 's only because i do not think saving their lives is an important as the economic and social strain they would put on the native populace . 
  more than half of them are n't leaving war on any sort of persecution anyway . 
  if they want to go to germany and enjoy it 's social benefits , they can apply for citizenship from their home countries like everybody else . 
  western europe has screw up immensely and is trying to drag eastern and central-eastern europe down with it . 
  the eu has only ever been a western european union in spirit , as the immigration crisis following the lifting of the iron curtain and the balkan wars have shown us . 
  but hope lies in the endless march of time . 
  that map in the right corner over there , those borders , they are not and never were fixed . 
  nations rearrange , people migrate , even now . 
  if we but embraced our past , we could end this crisis in a year or less . 
  but we wo n't . 
  so , the only this left to us is to hold the land , no matter what it costs us . 
  against the waves , we must be like immovable stones , our foundation being the traditions and beliefs that predate even our modern-day nations . 
  we owe it to future generations to uphold our values , preserve our homelands thad had been past down to us . 
  one day , the eu will fade and crumble , but the nations of europe will still be here . 
  our ancestral homelands , our languages , our traditions , they will endure . 
  all we need do is fight for them when called upon . 
  how about we just invade libya and ship them all there ? 
  the country has been a mess since gaddafi was killed . 
  we need to establish order . 
  firstly , we would cut off the sea route entirely , and secondly , we could deport the migrants there , as our puppet government would accept them without question . 
  perhaps not in germany , but elsewhere ? 
  i think it could be done . 
  there should be no push for integration , these people are meant to be here temporarily . 
  it used to be , kind of .

  i 'm almost done with university and i have no idea how things will go when i have my degree . 
  but i am almost 100 % sure that i wo n't be in a position that will allow me to get a house and pop out a few kids in the next 5 years or so . 
  really ? 
  i 'm a woman in my mid 20 's and only two women i know are moms right now ( both have babies less than a year old ) . 
  one is supported by their parents , the other works in a family business and also does n't have to worry about money . 
  every other woman i know laughs at the idea of having kids right now , because it 's extremely hard to find a good enough job to support ourselves , let alone raise a family . 
  so career has to come first , even if you want to have kids . 
  this has a lot more to do with money than feminism . 
  do n't try it , you 'll hate yourself forever . 
  i actually prefer flancati too , but mi\u0161ke are a lot simpler to make , so we always stick to that . . 
  we have the same stuff in slovenia , but under different names . 
  your krafne are our krofi and your fritule are our mi\u0161ke . 
  do your fritule include raisins too ? 
  because ours often do , and i hate everything about that . 
  bigger places in bosnia should be safe for any traveller . . especially touristy ones like mostar . 
  and in places like that , you can easily get by with english , so do n't worry too much about that either  where are you going on your first solo trip , if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  i ( also a female ) am also planning a solo trip this spring , but ca n't decide between france , belgium and the netherlands . 
  it has n't changed at all . 
  our country is tiny , and during the biggest migration waves last year , we received a ton of immigrants . 
  things were tense for a while . 
  but they all just passed through , so it 's no big deal . 
  facebook was unbearable for a while though . 
  [ but there are !, 
  ] ( http://www.inyourpocket.com/ljubljana/pubs-bars-and-clubs ), 
  i do n't know how it is in other countries , but our gypsies mostly live in rural areas , so they 're kinda cut off from the rest of the population . 
  their non-gypsy neighbors really do n't like them though . 
  holy crap , i had no idea !, 
  he looks almost exactly like the guy in the second video , except he 's kneeling on the ground , covered with a blanket , instead of dancing around . 
  and all this time we thought he was crazy . . 
  whoa !, 
  do those goat things that make clanking noises appear in smaller versions too ? 
  because every year around christmas , there 's a man in trieste , italy that wears a weird costume , kneels on the ground and makes that same noise over and over again . 
  all this time i though it was just a crazy beggar in a weird bird costume , but now i 'm realizing that he might actually be doing a traditional romanian thing . 
  that 's the bullring , a shopping center . 
  [ trbovlje ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6vhtmco.jpg ) ( used to be a mining town back in the day , which is why there 's so many of those socialist-style apartment blocks . 
  now there 's a big thermal power plant there , so the city is still very industrial . ), 
  [ jesenice ] ( http://i.imgur.com/popjeuu.jpg ) ( lots of lower class balkan immigrants that came to live here when the steel industry was still going strong , the whole town is quite dark and there 's not much to do there . 
  and it 's full of those ugly apartment buildings . 
  we do n't have many industrial towns , but the ones we do have are really ugly . 
  nobody would care in slovenia . 
  hardcore patriots are quite rare here , and i feel like even most of our politicians do n't take themselves seriously anymore , so making fun out of the country does n't bother anyone . 
  even the biggest newspapers often joke about the government . 
  the regency/victorian era . 
  back then the women 's fashion started to change , and for a while it was seen as provocative for women to show their ankles . 
  which does n't make much sense , because showing cleavage was completely ok . 
  the ankle thing is probably a bit of an exaggeration , because the victorians definitely were n't puritans . 
  among other things , the victorians produced an incredible amount of porn , which would be considered freaky even by today 's standards . 
   immigrating to the u.s with the attitude that you are not an american first means that you likely are not going to be given jobs , have many friends , or have anything good happen to you in your community . 
  the exact same thing happens in europe . 
  the only difference is that here , you can easily survive without integrating into our culture . 
  they either live off welfare or work inside their own community , but they do n't have to adapt if they do n't want to . 
  these people are still very much separated from the rest of us . 
  which sucks for those who make an effort to become a part of our society , because now they have to live under a mean social stigma caused by their fellow countrymen . 
  they 'll never lose their identity , because that 's the one thing they value over everything else . 
  haha , i 'm pretty sure that when people speak of `` southern , arabic '' people doing something so disgusting , nobody thinks `` oh , those damn spaniards are at it again ! '' . 
  spain would have never even crossed my mind in a situation like this one . 
   but do n't mess with definition of marriage because it is what it is . 
  if you want something new , then find another name for it . 
  but why ? 
  why would we need to do that ? 
  it 's easier to change a few words in an already established law , than to create a new one . 
   regarding adoption . 
  this is very sensitive topic and it is far from clear if it is appropriate to give a child to gay couple . 
  childrens are not like pets which satisfy one 's needs for companionship . 
  actually , it 's very clear . 
  i have no idea how people like you can go around and be so sure in themselves , when there 's a shit ton of articles on the internet about growing up in a gay household . 
  every single legitimate research of the topic so far proved that children of gay parents suffer no negative consequences and grow up the same as children in `` normal '' families . 
  read [ this ] ( http://consumer.healthday.com/public-health-information-30/family-health-news-749/more-evidence-that-kids-of-gay-parents-do-just-fine-701902.html ) or [ this ] ( http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150615103946.htm ) or [ this ] ( http://www.supremecourt.gov/obergefellhodges/amicusbriefs/14-556_american_psychological_association.pdf ) or [ this ] ( http://qz.com/438469/the-science-is-clear-children-raised-by-same-sex-parents-are-at-no-disadvantage/ ) or just use google and find countless other articles . 
  and the fact that you 're comparing gay parents adopting children to people buying pets , is one of the most ridiculous statements i 've ever seen regarding this issue . 
  so when gay people want to adopt a kid , they 're obviously just looking for a pet to entertain them , but when a `` normal '' family decides to have a kid , they do it for better , completely different reasons ? 
  do you have any idea how homophobic your ideas sound ? 
   marriage is foundation of a family and two gay people can not make a family with each other . 
  wrong on both parts . 
  first , gay people can easily make a family through adoption or artificial insemination . 
  or do you think that straight people with fertility issues should n't have the right to marry either ? 
  and secondly , marriage is a socially recognized union or legal contract between spouses that establishes rights and obligations between them , between them and their children , and between them and their in-laws . 
  that is the most commonly accepted definition . 
  nowhere in that does it say that the two spouses have to be able to conceive a child together . 
  unless you 're talking about the religious definitions , the gender of the two spouses does n't matter . 
   and why does it bother you that registration is not called marriage ? 
  because it 's discrimination against gay people . 
  again , i 'm talking about the legal definition of marriage , not the religious one . 
  homosexuality is not illegal , so why ca n't they get married ? 
  two consensual adults should n't be excluded from marriage because of something they have no control over . 
  and the current registration procedure does n't give registered couples the same rights a married couple has , especially when it comes to inheritance . 
   and considering black people as not-people is something completely different than chosing a name for a partnersih-union , which can have different names for different forms without any harm for people . 
  i think discrimination based on sexual preference is pretty harmful to people . 
   gay people can marry just like the rest of citizens - with opposite sex . 
  and we ca n't marry same sex just like gay people ca n't . 
  that 's not equality . 
  it has already been established that homosexuality is completely natural , is n't a mental illness and is n't a personal choice . 
  therefore , limiting these people 's rights is discrimination . 
  they do n't want special rights , they want the same rights you have . 
  not to marry a man/woman , but to marry the person they love , regardless of gender . 
   i think it would n't be a problem for most of us to give gay couples all those rights which also come with marriage . 
  just call it something else , not marriage . 
  marriage is what it is . 
  why ? 
  why would changing the definition of marriage bother you ? 
  we 're not talking about the religious definition of marriage , we 're talking about a lawful union of two persons .

  go see some sights rather than colect pokemon, 
  in poland they are paramilitary . 
  and those paramilitary get highered by ukrain . 
  maybe the foreighn legion , and ukrain . 
  isis is also highering . 
  they would find out . 
  you just posted it here , online for all to see . 
  when my cousin went to a military high school in serbia they checked on us livin in slovenia . 
  the military knows how to get info budy . 
  also their psiho tests are good . 
  go to ukrain , theyy take you as a foot solder, 
  thats why you should direct him at placed like ukrain , syria , karabah , ect . 
  theyll take anything, 
  you can try ukrain , but i doubt they will train . 
  pilot . 
  try places like transnistria , south osetia , abhkazia . 
  im prety sure ukrain is taking foreighn mercenaries to fight new russia , new russia is also taking foreighners and american are already serving there . 
  how about joing the french foreighn legion ? 
  why wont the americans have you ? 
  to crazy ? 
  dont they take all the kanon fotr they can get ? 
  you know coledge ia free ower here , you dont need to join the army . 
  austria took our land and inslaved our people . 
  italy took our land and inslaved our people . 
  hungary took our land and inslaved our people , croatia wants to take our land and ozr rightfull acses to the open see . 
  you should learn a slabic lanhuage like say russian . 
  its a big language not to mention a lingua franca for most of the former ussr . 
  if you want to learn some trickey grammer and speak an arhaic language learn slovenian , it will give you insight to south and west slavic languages . 
   would anyone even accept such a concept ? 
  probably only the crazy englishman and modernist duch . 
   even the concept of a homogenous spain is rejected by most people . 
  accept madrid , the king and franco ey, 
  there are only 300 countriesin the entire world . 
  how hard is it to learn lagues . 
  we did change a dozan asembelies since than . 
  and the republoc can still be sued . 
  i think we should ban american tv . 
  and tighten both external border of the and also suspend shengen and reipose internal borders . 
  burek somehow came to . 
  and for aome reason we put sour crouts and wurst in it . 
  also most populas is chese burek . 
  consider that !, 
  exyugoslavia , mostly and , not so much, 
  didnt the people chose the representatives ? 
  and do we realy want a referendum on store closimg times ?

  now forcing the lunch hour makes nosense , if you want take it , here it is if you dont thats fine . 
  whell i think we should close on sundays . 
  it was the will of the people . 
  we are great friends with . 
  central europe . 
  your geography is impecable ... google slavonija, 
   may i also draw your attention to the legally binding referendum in 2003 where the people decided that stores should not be open on sundays . 
  have you seen anyone respect the outcome of this referendum ? 
  yeah , me neither . 
  you are free to sue the republic . 
  i wear green camuflagues . 
  isnt strasburg the capital ? 
   oh , i do , when i am . 
  this is n't the case , though . 
  the argument was wether the constitution alowed a nation or a republic to exit sfrj . 
   tell any serious slovenian linguist that you took sskj as gospel , and they 'll laugh at you . 
  tell any serious english linguist that you took oxford dictionary as gospel , and they 'll laugh at you . 
  you want me to break out pravopis ? 
  not much of a definition but still the same thing tuje dr\u017eavljanstvo , odvzeti dr\u017eavljanstvo , slovenski narod . 
  see the pattern here ? 
  or shall we move to the serbian language for the same deffinition ? 
   i ca n't even ... 
  when did the slovenian nation settle in these here lands ? 
   murska republika ok what about it ? 
  a slovenian atempt of creating a socialist republic . 
  shortlived but brave . 
   ooooh , you 're one of `` those people '' . 
  what people ? 
  luxemburges ? 
  may i remind you that even our cityzenship is partly tied to nationalety this concept being called `` narodizem '' as acording to dr. luk\u0161i\u010d . 
   well then , was interesting talking to you , but i do n't want to waste my time with `` you people '' . 
  you some sort of rog hippy ? 
   okay out neither is belgium, 
   at a civilized law ? 
  and its two years, 
  isis has bosnian video makers , trust me there are isis man who know about this chatolic haven here, 
   kunstfr ? 
   the acknowledgment of the existence of a right and the implementation of that acknowledgment do n't have to align . 
  my point is based on the yugoacknowledged existence of that right , not on how yugoslavia chose to implement it . 
  youre bending into a pretsel man . 
  admit it when you are wrong ...  oxford disagrees with you - note the or - and they know more about words than you or i do . 
  sskj disagres with you . 
  and they are not some cheep dictionary made every year and efected by sjws .

  it proved that some economies have issues . 
  overall euro is still a good thing and i think a vast majority of its users would agree . 
  you just ca n't beat the practicality of using a single currency in `` whole '' europe . 
  yep . 
  if uk chooses to remain , some packt with eastern block ( v4 + others ) should be established to counterweight germany . 
  cameron already visited the v4 and also others ( inc. . slovenia ) to lobby for some deal about a year ago . 
  and i think that was a good idea . 
  on the other hand if uk leaves i doubt the eu will last . 
  everyone is already fed up with merkel about the migration thing . 
  not really hopeful for an eu under germany 's control . 
  why would exiting eu make uk less attractive for muslim migrants ? 
  i am not even sure it will limit migrants from eu . 
  not while your economy so willingly accepts them . 
  with muslims it 's probably a culture clash problem ? 
  same with eastern europeans or more of an economical/jobs one ( from an avg persons perspective ) ? 
  would be great to know the real debate behind the referendum , pc media fails as always . 
  so it 's become obvious that the referendum is about imigration . 
  so can someone pls tell me which group of migrants are percieved as the biggest problem ? 
  those from the eu , outside of eu , or doese n't matter ? 
  i can understand that , but i doubt many people from balkans will aim to get to uk . 
  more like germany . 
  also the migration problem seems to me self inflicted . 
  your economy is very open to foreign labour , at least for low skilled workers . 
  so probably you shuld try to find a better balance between people 's wishes and capitals wishes . 
  and not mix this with eu , exiting which will screw them both . 
  wow , why would you opose the balkan countries from joining ? 
  sorry but thats kinda lame , culturally they are all westerns with minor local folklore . 
  must say i am dissapointed . 
  if this kind of propaganda helps for brexit camp and you wote out , than maybe you really do n't belong in the eu . 
  in my experience ( foreign ) german coins dominate here than austrian and french . 
  i would say ~ 1/3 of them are slovenian . 
  at least for 1 and 2 $ coins , ca n't really differentiate the lower value ones . 
   enslave ( hence the word ` slave ' ) thats just wrong , word `` slav '' was self assigned , and means `` people who can speak '' . 
  check your facts . 
   let 's unite all slavic people under one banner ... 
  the russian one funny you should say that . 
  i think that independance/decentralization is kinda of a slavic thing/fetish . 
  so i agree that pan-slavism politically would n't end well . 
  same goes for federalization of eu . 
  having said that , i personally do feel closer to other slavic nations , than non slavic ones . 
  but i guess that is only because i can effortlessly understand lot of their language . 
  yep i agree . 
  actual consumption is probably much higher because not all production is accounted for . 
  and that goes for all alcohol , particularly schnapps . 
  and where wine grapes wo n't grow it is quite common to make schnapps from tepka peas/apples/plums . 
  in the country side , especially smaller villages a lot of households make their own schnapps and it is customary to offer it to visitors . 
  russia should have won :(, 
  so poland , russia , italy , germany :p last sweden :( poland can into space !, 
  i thought there were only gay people watching :d, 
  wow uk is actually good for once ... 
  so far poland , italy , germany :p, 
  what 's with all the boy bands this year ? 
  it 's like the 90s all over again :(, 
  definitely bih . 
  well at least we do n't get to watch boooooring austria commercials , before every song . 
  like last year . 
  title is misleading . 
  people here are trying to learn german , because they already know some english . 
  from primary school onward english is a part of school program so everyone learns it . 
  german is only tought at certain schools as an option . 
  those who learn it do so for work/business reasons . 
  having worked with germans for the german market , i can tell first hand it is good to know it . 
  all project related documentation is typically in german and also a lot of them do n't or are unvilling to speak english . 
  also near the austrian border gastarbeiter is a big thing . 
   but europe hates us . 
  no we do n't . 
  that we do n't agree 100 % on open issues does not mean we hate you . 
  we have minor differences and that 's it . 
  nothing special , happened to me in italy . 
  it 's a pain if you are not used of toll booths . 
  vignettes for everyone :p, 
  you can walk uphill . 
  i find this excessive self mockery repetitive and kinda lame . 
  gdp as a measure of power is quite shitty . 
  also eu is now where near as homogenous . 
  if russia was to invade anything , it would be `` every man for himself here '' , do n't kid yourself . 
  maybe some additional sanctions would be imposed , after a year or so . 
  yes subsidized food for students is kinda unique . 
  makes eating as a student really cheap . 
  i do n't think so . 
  people today care less much about being placed in the balkans . 
  that was more of a post independence thing , most people today i think just do n't care anymore . 
  same goes for mixing with slovakia . 
  fun fact is that borut pahor is the exact opposite of our previous president danilo turk . 
  the latter was much more formal and snobbish . 
  also pahor manages to be the first `` president of all people '' in slovenia , basically just by not stirring up any ideological issues . 
  just for that he gets my vote at next election . 
  more money from tourism . 
  croatia already gets a lot , but i imagine it could do better with $ . 
  vast majority of tourists comes from $ area . 
  tldr : he is part of ( was part of ) right-wing politicians , i vote left-wing politicians . 
  i wonder what was the state of mind of the person who thought of this . 
  is it like : `` that will show those silly slovenes '' ( maleficent ) , or `` may they have a good laughter '' ( playful ) , maybe `` kra\u0161 chocolate is the best , they 'll like it for sure '' ( sincere ) ?? 
  yes it 's just amazing how diverse italy is . 
  bad idea , would accomplish nothing only harm trade between us and eu . 
  there are other countries beside the eu with which us can trade . 
  not the correct time for another `` holier than thou '' eu move . 
  wow where were these taken ? 
  to lazy to translate your link :(, 
   unfortunately , we will have to somehow regulate tourism in centers soon or later .

  one year they made it so all the kids had holidays the same week and ski slopes were crazy crowded . 
  then they changed it back to half of the country 1 week , other half of the country next week . 
  prettiest one in my town is [ celjski dom ] ( http://urosperich.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/celje-celjski-dom2.jpg ) . 
  ugliest would be [ this thing ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/@46.2263157,15.2668792,3a,75y,266.16h,88.11t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sr3vx1odcdskhjvqlu2ej6q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=sl ) our a [ bus station ] ( http://www.izletnik.si/mma/celje_avtobusna_postaja/2016012909330770/mid/ ) . 
  no idea . 
  someone could come up with a new one . 
  our maybe we could be the first ( ? ), 
  country with two official anthems !, 
  sporting events are the most common events to hear our anthem and it 's not the type of an anthem to hype you up which is something i like . 
   in any case , i prefer one about peace than about slitting throats . 
  sport events or no . 
  durrr i do to . 
  i 'm sure no one inspires to be a good neighbour while playing a football or basketball match ... 
  even if civil union or registered partnerships are equal by law to marriage it 's still discriminatory to not allow seme sex unions to be called marriage . 
  it 's better than no rights at all but still discriminatory . 
  same sex couples can get married here the same way as other couples but because they ca n't adopt their definition of marriage is still not equal . 
  it 's not ? 
  it 's just not a typical inspiring anthem . 
  i like it . 
  even though i sometimes wonder why it was chosen as the national anthem because the lyrics are so uninspiring for sport events . 
  italians always get so hyped singing their anthem and i feel like joining peace corps after listening to ours . 
  russian anthem is the best anthem . 
  sometimes bbc world , bbc earth a lot of times . 
  hahaha, 
  huh ? 
  marriage does n't have to do anything with religion . 
  i mean you can have a church wedding but primarily it 's a legal thing done by a civil authority . 
  we say ' \u017eivita na koruzi ' - ` they live on a corn ' . 
  do n't ask me why coz i do n't know . 
  crowded , that 's what it is . 
   tiny ass country 11million + population ok ... 
  i do to . 
  i usually hit an upvote in that case if i did n't already . 
  you can see parents sitting on the sides and up on the 2nd floor and later dancing with their kids . 
  it 's not obligatory to attend this . 
  we have vocational programmes * lower vocational education ( npi ) - lasts 2 years , you only need to finish 7 out of 9 years of elementary education or finish adapted elementary education to get into these . 
  this is considered the lowest secondary education . 
  it 's basically to provide a basic secondary education and profession even for those who are n't mentally , phisically or in any other way capable of finishing other levels of education . 
  you can get professional eduction in wood processing , assisting in construction technology , assisting in biotechnology , assisting in technological processes , transforming textiles . 
  * secondary vocational education ( spi ) - lasts 3 years , you need to finish elementary education or npi . 
  you can get a profession such as administrator , seller , hotelier , gardener , florist , nurse carer , mason , carpenter , drywall constructor , ceramist , electrician , toolmaker , car repairman , hairdresser , chimney sweeper , forester , butcher , heavy construction machinery operator ... you can continue with 2 years of vocational technical education after finishing spi and after that you can get into tertiary education . 
  * secondary technical education - lasts 4 years . 
  you can get professions such as economic technician , kindergarten teacher assistant , gastronomic and tourist technician , health care technician , cosmetic technician , horticultural technician , construction t. , environmental t. , electro t. , computer t. , chemistry t. , ... and lots more . 
  basically technician professions . 
  these schools have been gaining in popularity a lot because after you finish it , you 're left with a profession . 
  after finishing gymnasium , you have no profession at all . 
  you can get into all professional bachelor programmes after finishing this or write an exam from an aditional subject at matura exam to get into some academic bachelor programmes . 
  * gymnasiums - these are considered as general education . 
  only students with good grades in elementary school are supposed to attend this schools . 
  there are different types of gymnasiums . 
  regular one , classical gymnasium ( main class is latin , more history and philosophy , less biology , chemistry and physics ) , sports gymnasium ( for students with high athletic potential ) , euro-gymnasium ( learn more about europe and languages ) , technical gymnasium , economic gymnasium and art gymnasium . 
  there 's also a few catholic gymnasiums ( though you do n't have to be catholic to attend ) and waldorf gymnasiums . 
   are there some careers , ( i 'm thinking pedagogy in particular ) , that are considered `` vocational '' in your country that are not in the us ? 
  i do n't know what 's considered vocational there . 
  the only ` pedagogy ' profession you can get with secondary education is kindergarten teacher assistant . 
  for everything else you need tertiaty education . 
  preschool education ( as in kindergarten teacher , not assistant ) is the only professional bachelor study programme in pedagogy field , the rest are all academic bachelor study programmes . 
   is there less of a stigma about it in your country ? 
  there 's a bit of a stigma for lower and secondary education programmes as you need to do real bad in elementary school to not have an option to attend secondary professional education or gymnasiums ( if we do n't consider students from adapted elementary education - students with special needs ) . 
  also because they 're mostly schools for immigrant population . 
  american proms are for students only , our graduation dance is done infront of parents and teachers and we dance quadrille , waltz , tango and similar . 
  we have dance classes throughout the last year . 
  the only simliarity is dancing in a ballroom . 
  there 's nothing american about it ? 
  probably a bit more than czechs . 
  you 're the least germanic of germanic nations . 
  really ? 
  everyone here is taught about celts . 
  my city was one of the major towns of noricum . 
  no , nothing like that here . 
  like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj4ymmplews ) . 
  edit : that 's graduation dance usually held around march . 
  then at the end of a school year there 's a [ graduation parade ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjitm82l7hy ) . 
   just give back triest excuse me ?? 
  well i know plenty . 
  even my neighbours deep in the countryside of styria . 
  one of them have a vegan farm and always have plenty of visitors which i assume are vegan as well . 
  idk percentages though and it 's possible that vegans are over represented in my area . 
  who knows . 
  [ primorje dialect group ] ( https://youtu.be/eane5etcnt4 ) and indian/pakistani accent . 
  idk why people dislike it , i think it 's so funny . 
  greece for sure . 
  then italy . 
  and then uk . 
  i generally go with ` you are what culture and values you were raised in ' . 
  you can live in japan but if you 're raised in portugese culture and values you 're more portugese than japanese . 
  this is a very debatable topic . 
  is that 450 $ ( x2 = 900 $ ) ? 
  that 's not even a lot for a city like prague . 
  that 's pretty much minimum even for a village like ljubljana . 
  there 's a thing called ` key giveaway ' at the end of school year where the winning 4th grade from a previous year makes up games in which 3rd graders compete in to win the key . 
  ( also a thing at the end of elementary school ) . 
  [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvadv_qybfg ) then there 's a graduation parade where students dance quadrille in city centers accross the country . 
  it has spread to other countries as well in recent years . 
  [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qosopu4y58w ) some classes also do pranks on their class teachers . 
  it does here , that 's what i 'm saying . 
  how many times do i have to repeat it ? 
  it does here , that 's what i 'm saying . 
  vacation here translates to ` po\u010ditnice ' . 
  ` po\u010ditek ' means ` rest ' .

they seek to learn from the past how did the roman empire fall ? 
  was n't it because of uncontrolled immigration ? 
  and then the dark middle ages came ? 
  it seems in this migrant crisis everyone overlooks this period of history and only remembers ww2 . 
  i do n't care being called a nazi . 
  the moment when a single migrant steps on my land he will be filled lead in his arse !, 
  nothing is granted in this world , we all have to fight for what we get in one way or another . 
  i 'll be looking for asylum soon as well if these cunts continue to flood europe . 
  i will try in nz first , if not successful then iceland or svalbard . 
  i am really scared about what is happening . 
  that 's a name i have n't heard in a long time ... 
  thank you . 
  i will consider visit bulgaria . 
  if not this year , some time in near future for sure . 
  how is sea at late september ? 
  still warm enough to swim in ? 
  i have in plan to travel somewhere in late september , but i am not decided yet where . 
  even if sea is not warm enough in that time , i might go the mountains . 
  slovenia never claimed any of croatian territory , it was the other way around . 
  and of course slovenia wanted to resolve the problem once and for all . 
  at least slovenia has ambitions to resolve the problem while croatia wants to stay on occupied territories for as long as possible and later claimed it as their own because , you know , they will `` use '' that territory for a while now . 
  croatia can say anythink it wants but the thing is arbitration will go on . 
  oh and claiming that croatia will not respect the final decision ? 
  they will . 
  of course they will resist at the beginning , that 's expected , but they will face diplomatic isolation , later maybe even sanctions , but at the end they will shut up and respect the decision . 
  croatia plays their diplomatic game like some spoiled child . 
  you 're in europe now so act like europe . 
  we have a problem ? 
  lets try to fix it then , not to whine about it and play own game . 
  it was not cheating , only trust issues . 
  whoah whoah , that escalated very quickly !, 
  calm down please  croatia can decide not to respect the decision , but then it is also croatia 's responsibility for their actions ( caused affairs ) in front of international community . 
  ~ ~ neither side can do it unilaterally . 
  at least arbitral tribunal has to be involved . 
  [ article ] ( http://www.iccwbo.org/products-and-services/arbitration-and-adr/arbitration/icc-rules-of-arbitration/#article_6 ) . ~ ~ edit : vienna convention can be used only in major violation of contract , when further fulfillment would n't be possible anymore . 
  in this case , only the trust of process was violated and the possibility of solution is provided in the very arbitration agreement . 
  slovenia was already urged by tribunal to the soluten - slovenia will propose another arbitrator . 
  there is no legal way to unilaterally withdraw from this arbitration . 
  both sides are obligated to bring the process to the end and respect the final decision . 
  the process will go on , whatever anybody says . 
  you know us to well . 
  why is this downvoted ? 
  someone cares to explain ? 
  please austria , do n't . 
  pls . 
  love you < 3, 
  no , we should send them in usa . 
  usa created chaos in the middle east and lybia , so it 's usa 's fault these refugees and migrants exist . 
  our industry is gone , banks are for sale and investment in high education has dropped . 
  other former socialist republic such as poland , czech republic and slovakia will surpass us very soon . 
  i read your points and every single one is explained from another point of view in the link i provided . 
  i think you should read [ here ] ( http://www.adaptt.org/animalrights.html# ) why zoo 's are not ok . 
  yes . 
  close all zoo 's , circuses and all other places , that exploit animals for human entertainment . 
  release the animals in the wild , where they belong . 
  they even have a saying : * `` pri\u010daj srpski da te ceo svet razume '' * , meaning * `` speak serbian so that the whole world understands you . 
  it 's weird , but somehow everyone on this world understands serbian . 
  gay lobby is strong . 
  every dictatorship has some limitations in human rights and freedom of speech . 
  and there is always a factor that inhibits development and progress of society . 
  oh , now it 's clear to me why serbs attacked croatia from east . 
  your generation probably fucks more than previous generations , but the difference is your generation uses condomes . 
  taxes are going up to cover migrants support . 
  and i am scared every time i am on a railway or bus station where these people are . 
  you never know what is their mission . 
  if we grant registrated union all rights from marriage then there would be no discrimination and it would n't be harmful to anyone . 
  but do n't mess with definition of marriage because it is what it is . 
  if you want something new , then find another name for it . 
  i would like that it is clear that if i say `` i am married '' , this means by default `` with a woman '' ( if i am a man ) , not that i would need to additionally explain that . 
  it 's very sensitive to me if i need to explain anyone that i am not gay . 
  regarding artificial insamination . 
  i am not religious in any way , i 'll make that clear . 
  i am against artificial insamination in any form . 
  there is already too much people on this planet , no need to make them even more in artificial way . 
  our planet can supply only a finite amount of resources to us , the more there is people on eart , the more ecosystem is burdened and more we suffer from shortages and conflicts . 
  regarding adoption . 
  this is very sensitive topic and it is far from clear if it is appropriate to give a child to gay couple . 
  childrens are not like pets which satisfy one 's needs for companionship . 
  marriage is foundation of a family and two gay people can not make a family with each other . 
  but they can have ( and they already have ) a partnership registration , granting them all rights that come from marriage . 
  so thats why changing the definition of marriage bothers me . 
  and why does it bother you that registration is not called marriage ? 
  and considering black people as not-people is something completely different than chosing a name for a partnersih-union , which can have different names for different forms without any harm for people . 
  but we all have equal marriage rights . 
  gay people can marry just like the rest of citizens - with opposite sex . 
  and we ca n't marry same sex just like gay people ca n't . 
  we have equal rights in this aspect . 
  or do you mean different rights ? 
  well , that would be discrimination . 
  i think it would n't be a problem for most of us to give gay couples all those rights which also come with marriage . 
  just call it something else , not marriage . 
  marriage is what it is . 
  why do you want to enforce something against population 's will ? 
  maybe try again in 20 years when entire generation changes . 
  but not now , you know the resoults of public opinion on this topic and it would be destructive to put it against will . 
  you need to learn to respect different opinions . 
  do i cry a river when my party does n't win elections ? 
  no , i respect decision of population , even if i do n't agree with it . 
  well , do you want the rights of minority to be voted on by the minority ? 
  and by the way , what rights are you talking about ?

  nazis had gestapo , and yet it was held against german people as a whole that they did nothing . 
   how prosperous their citizens were in the long term from one ruler to the next , is highly debatable . 
  which was exactly my point . 
  should 've read my post . 
  but you have n't anschluss 'd them yet . 
  i have a friend from belarus and , if he 's right , belarus is n't really just a russian puppet . 
  i intend to visit it this summer , so that i can see for myself . 
  china , abbasid caliphate , all the enlightened absolutist kingdoms ... 
  the problem is that liberal democracy is the only system we discovered where prosperity does n't depend on the quality of a single ruler . 
  not all germans of that generation were guilty of being nazis , but nearly all germans of that generation are guilty of not opposing nazism . 
  when your government commits crimes , not fighting against it makes you an accomplice . 
  that 's the standard we developed regarding nazi germany . 
  i do n't see why it should n't apply to russia . 
  apart from religion , you need to count in the different historical experience . 
  croatians have the experience of being austrian/hungarian/venetian frontier province ; serbs and especially montenegrins , of being a stubborn rebellious province with a tradition of statehood ; bosniaks , of being the privileged class in the ottoman empire . 
  centuries of such differences necessarily leave a mark on collective memory . 
  then , there 's also the fact that serbia was the first to become independent in the 19th century and that before joining yugoslavia it pursued independent - and expansionist - foreign policy for more than 100 years . 
  meanwhile croatia developed as a nation while a part of austria-hungary , struggling for its own identity against hungarians , austrians and italians . 
  bosniaks , on the other hand , were late to the nationalism party because ottoman empire counted all muslims as part of the muslim millet ; they started becoming a nation in the modern sense only in 1878 . 
  again , divergent histories , divergent experiences . 
  so it 's more than religion . 
  we are talking about three different nations who just happen to share the same language . 
  just for some additional information , * slovenski narod * ( the slovenian people ) , founded in 1868 , was the mouthpiece of slovenian liberals in austria-hungary and interwar yugoslavia . 
  they were anti-clerical , pro-free market and pro-yugoslavian ( later even unitarist ) faction . 
  by 1930 liberals and * slovenski narod * had already lost much of their influence , since the centralism in first yugoslavia had driven the lion 's share of slovenian population into sls ( christian conservative , nationalist party ) . 
  * slovenski narod * soldiered on until 1943 and ended its career as the official gazette of italian occupational authority . 
  for the same reason why germany and america hid and protected croatian fascists and terrorists : he was anti-communist . 
  yeah , basically . 
  i 'm not much of a usa fan , but you doing this to yourself is just an ugly sight, 
  the current european parliament suits me . 
  i 'd change the voting system a bit ( so that epp ca n't have three different electoral lists in slovenia ) . 
  i absolutely do n't want the chief of the government to be directly elected , especially not through electoral college . 
  i think current events across the pond show exactly why . 
  jambrek , rupel , hribar , grafenauer ? 
  they only need b.a. 
  novak and bogomir kova\u010d to co-sign and they have the intellectual-cultural mafia covered . 
  waaaait ... 
  they want executive presidency ? 
  no thanks , i 'll pass . 
  left for hawaiians to take . 
  french jews do n't speak french ? 
  also , you still have n't told what are the incompatibilies . 
  if i recall correctly , and i might be mistaken on this one , the european solution was supposed to be quotas . 
  it advertised itself as a goody-two-shoes nation and started to believe its own hype . 
  no , i 'm asking you what are the incompatibilities between the culture of french and the culture of french jews . 
   that is not the definition of an immigrant . 
  if you live in another country , you are an immigrant . 
  did i say anything about definition ? 
  i said that immigrants usually stay for undefined time . 
  most people do n't like moving around non-stop . 
   just as many incompatibilities as between the french culture and other semitic cultures . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  i have enough bitterness in my life without getting angry about such stuff . 
  but , hey , if you have the energy to fight , go for it . 
   and unless you wan na spend your life there , i frankly do n't see why immigrants should be forced to take classes . 
  immigrants usually stay for undefined time . 
  plus it 's just disrespectful to move somewhere and not even take the effort to learn how to communicate with the locals . 
  i say that as an immigrant . 
   so how will we make the jewish adopt our culture ? 
  cuz i bet they 'll be thrilled . 
  so what 's the radical difference between french culture and french jewish culture ? 
  what 's incompatible here ? 
  there are many , many people who still think we 're basically yugoslavs , interchangeable with everyone from vardar to triglav . 
  the rest do n't know the difference between us and slovakia . 
  \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af edit : [ case in point ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5mcscz/most_troublecausing_asylum_seekers_in_the/dc2sbn5/ ), 
  you are aware that there are still many people who never learned about you in geography classes , right ? 
  wait until those who grew up after you split from soviet union become a majority and nobody will annoy you anymore with that shit . 
   sweden always too neutral to be neutral . 
  is this bait ? 
  i think this is bait . 
  reminds me of catania, 
  holy shit , this city has twice the population of my city and 1/6 of its area . 
  how do they move around during rush hours ? 
  if you want to prematurely destroy the human race , go ahead . 
  yugoslavia was to the west of iron curtain . 
  but yes , i understand your point . 
  well , slovenia generally does n't have problems with serbia , we have croatia to hate/love . 
  it 's more historical experience . 
  we have been terrible roommates . 
  as of now our teamwork has caused one world and one regional war , brought down one empire , one kingdom and one federation , and there are also two genocides in that mix . 
  i 'd personally like if we ended all up in eu ( being a product of three generations of intermarriage ) , but i just do n't trust our peoples . 
  we were not supposed to be able to go to war while we were all in yugoslavia either , but . 
  i do n't have to click it to know what it is . 
  that song almost caused my non-existence . 
   keyboard 's too tiny 3/10 would n't tap, 
  you seriously want to have serbia , croatia and slovenia in the same union ? 
  ah , but if they started talking about politicians everybody would just shrug and say `` well they are lying thieves , what 's else on the menu ? '', 
  this here , on the other hand , apparently stings a bit . 
  why bloody ? 
  they seem just a bit worse than french cars and on the same level as fiat . 
  thankfully . 
  i was afraid we 'd be something like `` dirty mafioso immigrants '' . 
  sensible british would get mad at their government . 
  britards would get mad at europeans . 
  but invisible hand, 
  ` cos you used \\ # before numbers . 
  they harden , for the same reason why you get goosebumps . 
  nipples are skin , dicks are blood-soaked sponges . 
  what becomes red when it 's very cold are the parts that could freeze - nose , ears , fingers . 
  it pays to keep the blood vessels there nice and wide , to bring heat to them .

  for my country its kinda different . 
  look 4 % of my country is muslim , mostly bosniaks and albanians who are integrated very good . 
  we have not had an major incident since the 1991 or the so called 10day-war . 
  with amount of isis members joining refugee ranks and coming to germany , more terrorist attacks are undeniable . 
  the same goes for france , belgium and sweden . 
  any country with big non-european muslim communities are expected to have terrorist attacks . 
  as for fatal crashes , maybe you can use that point to make yourself feel more safe . 
  there is no point of playing the swj card on me , i was in germany 2weeks ago . 
  i havent seen no groping or raping , but threat of terrorism is undeniable . 
  i feel like you are not livng in your own country but in a enclave where every thing is good and will be good . 
  its simply not real . 
  they should expect terrorist attacks thou . 
  cancer . 
  its crazy . 
  what ? 
  we basically made you its ok . 
  my son , there are 504 mil europeans living in eu . 
  i mean point can be made that white europeans will lose their majority in a country like us but for europe to turn islamic ? 
  lol, 
  albanian muslims are often heavy drinkers aka culturally muslim . 
   mother jones tracked and mapped shooting sprees over the three decades from 1982 to may of last year . 
  they counted `` at least 61 mass murders carried out with firearms across the country , with the killings unfolding in 30 states from massachusetts to hawaii , '' they found . 
   a congressional research service report published in 2013 counted 78 incidents over roughly the same period , in which 547 were killed . 
  definitions of mass shootings vary . 
  the report excludes those for whom terrorist ideology or criminal profit was a motivation . 
  the mother jones staff limited themselves to indiscriminate killings of at least four people in public places by lone shooters . 
   while us has 5 % of the world 's population , it sees about 31 % of public mass shootings  the 90 us mass shootings are nearly one-third of the 292 such attacks globally for that period . 
  while the united states has 5 % of the world 's population , it had 31 % of all public mass shootings . 
  `` people have been a little surprised by these statistics , '' said adam lankford , an associate professor of criminal justice at the university of alabama , who did the analysis . 
  lankford presented his work at the american sociological association 's annual conference last year and said it 's the first research of its kind to do a global comparison . 
   in the united states , people have a greater chance of dying in mass shootings if they 're at work or at school . 
  overseas , these incidents typically happen near military installations . 
  in more than half the american cases , the shooter had more than one firearm . 
  in global incidents , the shooter typically had only one gun . 
  and in the united states , there are 6.87 victims on average per incident . 
  in the other 171 countries lankford studied , the average was 8.8 victims per incident . 
  source : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26822013, 
  then we can not compare . 
  usa is worse . 
  do school shotings count ? 
  i dont get it , who hates us ? 
  i dont think it is . 
  but city of izmir could defiently be european ... 
  look i come from the country of 2 mil . 
  there are around 500 thousand americans with slovenian roots . 
  like i said before , i would assist you and take great interest in you if you had slovenian ancestry , simply because there are only 500 thousand of you . 
  lol , why do people like you exist ? 
  if he is slovenian , i am gon na take great interest in him . 
  we are a country of 2 mil after all . 
  the funniest thing was when he tried to diss my country but often got it confused with slovakia . 
  lol . 
  you dirty bastard !, 
  its not that bad doe , germany is still 80 % german while germany with european ( without turkey ) immigrants make 92 % of population ... 
  slovenian,english,serbo-croat , russian and german . 
  i would say my german is the worst even doe i studied it for 8 years . 
  i was expecting 5 minut nazad ... 
  lol, 
  sure . 
  neki je kultura , protestantska in kapitalisti\u010dna . 
  just because we had 2-3 good companys that doesnt mean shit . 
  you mean like slovenia made somekind of terrorist act on yugoslavia , or how germans were behind it all . 
  cmon man ... 
  its lie . 
   we used to produse our own explosives , our own leder , our own automobiles , our own trains ... where is this now ? 
  most of this was subpar and shit ... 
  m8 dont play tupid on me ... 
  lol you wish m8 . 
  it was probably the smartest idea that ever occured in the world . 
  yugoslavia was nothing for good for slovenia . 
  our industry was old and very polluting . 
  we could play this game only till the debt fills up . 
  ofc , our industry was backward and non-competitive because we knew we would always have a market ... 
  if any of you stupid shits would take time and study why euro is good for us it would be beautiful . 
   more choice and stable prices for consumers and citizens  greater security and more opportunities for businesses and markets  improved economic stability and growth  more integrated financial markets  a stronger presence for the eu in the global economy  a tangible sign of a european identity, 
  no i am not   tupid < < you are just a conspiracy nut . 
  self-hating slavs is becoming a trend , thx god not in my country ... 
  slovenia is not a country you think it is . 
  most companies were keept under state control so rapid privatization and destruction of industry would not happen . 
  its the same with communists . 
  they are just young people with no-seanse of reality . 
  people from denmark are smug as fuck . 
  germany is our biggest trading partner , eu and euro is good for us . 
  as long as germanys economy is stable , ours is too . 
  this guy is a serbian immigrant and a dirty dog who is deluded beyond comprehension . 
  he is lying like a dog lol ... 
  i feel like western nations often vastly underestimated what they get from eu . 
  i feel like britain leaving eu will only reinforce eu sentiment , as britain will get `` punished '' for leaving . 
  people also forget nazis threatened violently people to join the domobranci , many of the captured partizans even . 
  its well known in balkan . 
  for example leaders of yugoslavia supported joining axis pact , but the people went to the streets protesting it loudly . 
  so hitler attacked yugoslavia with help of hungarian and italian forces . 
  / r/kontaktnicenterhater, 
  m8 lying can only get you so far son . 
  go to bed , you are tired . 
  spewing bunch of nonsense is so overrated . 
  aha slovenization of russians !, 
  putin pls !, 
  lol you live in a fantasy world where slovenia is a oil country . 
  it 's obvious you dont know shit about economy . 
  m8 reading marx can only take you this far .

lower styria , yes . 
  terrible centralization in the other half of the country and they keep electing preposterous parties into the parliament . 
  same . 
  i actually hope that everyone gets fair treatment in my country , but perhaps your values are different from mine . 
  the ballot said that as long as the will of the voter was evident , it would be counted, 
  quite shocking statistic . 
  someone should post this to r/atheism , they 're going to have a field day . 
  haha . 
  that was great . 
  honestly , my question was about you and i 'm glad you came out on the issue . 
  thanks for clarifying . 
  can we ... ask why certain candidates are not on the shortlist ? 
  time to reform empire . 
  can confirm . 
  :( although i 'm not sure what the definition of an older adult is , but i 'll be there soon . 
  have you seen protestant heaven ? 
  it 's a dreadful affair . 
  top notch . 
  no elections scheduled for a while . 
  thank god ? 
  i usually vote for sds , which is a right-wing , pro-eu and controversial party . 
  their recent stance on syria and support for safezone implementations ( both turkish and jordanian ) is an absolute deal breaker . 
  the leftists are all insane , proven failures and live in a dream world . 
  therefore , my last hope is new slovenia , whom i voted for in the eu elections because i liked their candidates better . 
  you do n't deserve the downvotes , but on reddit sarcasm is prevalent unless the title has [ serious ] in its name . 
  that 's the play on the faulty perception !, 
  austria may now rejoin our empire . 
  i do n't think they lost palmyra directly because of manpower issues ( maybe qaryatayn ) . 
  the bigger problem was incompetence , they had a numerical advantage against isis . 
  the saa is in a poor shape manpower wise , but the ndf detachments are still very numerous and they rarely , if ever rotate out of their provinces . 
  so while the supply of men may not be ample and the saa is spread thin , there is a certain strategical reserve in the manpower pool , not to mention the uncommited elite saa forces around damascus . 
  a large portion of these hypothetical fighters would also end up on the rebel side , further reducing the strategical impact . 
  is that a staropramen or do my eyes see what they want to see ? 
  austria , followed by croatia . 
  remnants and influence of the former empire are all present in my area . 
  i utterly reject your fantasy stories . 
  the resistance movement was mainly hijacked by the communist agenda and as such we had brother-brother warfare between the partisans and the white guard . 
  i am thankful for the liberation , but opposed to the way it was achieved ( extra-judicial killings in the thousands , no different than the germans ) . 
  both sides fought for what they thought was the correct vision of the homeland , both sides fought for the homeland . 
  this is what we need to reconcile around . 
  my relatives were stuck in a partisan camp after wwii , for reasons unknown to me , but some of my family were conscripted into the german army ... a partisan aunt had to save their lives using her authority . 
  as such , i see it as fantasy to claim sds as a far-right nazi organization . 
  we need to work through the agenda both the left and right wing parties want to serve us ... 
  ` tis a sad and desolate [ place ] ( http://shrani.si/f/36/gh/10zeb98c/20150712203355.jpg ) ... 
  was pleasantly surprised !, 
  apparently we may support the new german idea about a temporary 5 year exit . 
  our financial minister has said no-no to restructuring existing greek debt ( lack of trust ) . 
  can confirm . 
  still doing coursework for theology in july . 
  thank you poland , for making me feel good about one of these maps . 
  thanks !, 
  fortunately i walk for hours every day and have superb shoes . 
  i 'll pass it on to my fellow volunteers . 
  i do n't think this is my type of thing but it 's interesting listening to experiences . 
  interesting . 
  would you say this is common or ordinary ? 
  as a volunteer for this year 's wyd i am both disgusted and intrigued . 
  i 'm gon na try and do more of that . 
  start buying veggies/olive oil/pumpkin oil at the open-air market where it 's all local ( or less local ) farms . 
  i guess we have different views on what very few consists of . 
  i 'm more of a person that looks at statistics , and statistically , the number is tiny . 
  but yeah , since there 's so many churches in the world , a raw number comes out that may deceive , imo . 
  like 7/3000 in slovenia . 
  it 's closer to 3 $ in the better places . 
  3.2-4 $ for a good one . 
  sweet !, 
  thanks for these . 
  you should go in sometime !, 
  i 'm just sitting here on the outside reading reddit . 
  it 's a bit yeah . 
  that grocer sells a lot of local tomatoes . 
  there 's similar ones to these from koper that he had last summer , but these taste just as good . 
  they 're from a company in prekmurje and they 're the real deal . 
  i also like italian monte rosso tomatoes , which are 2.99 . 
  premium tomatoes are around the same price . 
  i kind of like my life too , but us humans are never satisfied . 
  great !, 
  of course the referendum was an inside job , that part of austria should be slovenian today . 
  but i 'll let it slide ... for now . 
  rock on !, 
  i 've finished what was left of my salad today . 
  gon na drop some cucumbers dead in the evening . 
  how dare you implicate the great maister in schemes !, 
  be gone oppressor !, 
  i mean , maribor was a 95-99 % german city throughout all of its time right up to the liberation at the hands of maister . 
  some name pollution is to be expected . 
  the country overall is ... reasonably religious . 
  young adults , not very . 
  i do n't really want to litter this thread with this conversation , but there 's about 30-40 theology students in maribor ( on paper ) and i 've only ever seen me and one other girl at these events . 
  they have their own mass opportunities . 
  so two students of theology out of the usual 30-50 people that have time to attend is hardly overwhelming numbers . 
  that 's fair enough . 
  but since these are student masses , the students are pretty much all gone on the weekends so there would be no community without week-days . 
  i 'm not sure why that had to be pointed out , but yeah . 
  there 's dozens of us !!!!!, 
  seriously , banning a strong worldview ? 
  what 's wrong with you ? 
  if you want this subreddit to be an echo chamber , might as well ban all of us who are pro-life . 
  the church has always been opposed to exceptions in the case of rape . 
  conservatives may place a compromise on it , which is wrong , but you may be a conservative without being associated with the church .

  oh also , the croatian arbiter , after resigning , went public , on tv with that the decision was going to be . 
  but apparently abraham is not good enough , either . 
  this is just the usual business with slovenia-croatia relations , every time something like this will happen . 
  if it 's not sanader and jan\u0161a setting up incidents , it 's something like this . 
  the show must go on . 
  well , in soviet russia , humor gets you !, 
  `` bombs '' ? 
  why yes , we still got plenty of unexploded ww1 ordnance scattered around the old ww1 front line ... one or two big ones per year are still found . 
  well , baltic fish * are * unsafe , like an estonian fellow explained up there ... the baltic sea is n't the cleanest one , and there 's plenty of toxins in fish caught from it . 
  and yet , germany manages to stay together , somehow . 
  ah yes , the good ol' `` if you do n't think the same way i do , you 're stupid ! '', 
  argument . 
  i see no practical difference between that and living off the transfers from the richer administrative regions within your country , or to put it simply , `` living off the taxes of the richer folks '' . 
  besides , if you 're , say , on benefits , you 're returning the money back into the economy immediately , creating revenue for businesses . 
  the transfer money does n't just disappear into a black hole , it circulates . 
  i mean , it 's beneficial for everyone that there 's enough consumer buying power to go around , that means people will buy more stuff an in turn make more revenue for business . 
  and people labeling you a `` lazy leech '' just because you happened to have been born in the `` wrong '' place are cunts . 
  john oliver did it first !, 
  well , i ca n't say i 'm surprised , but it 's still useful for those `` back of the envelope calculations and notes '' . 
  possiby , yeah . 
  i 'm just saying that in the summer , the main border crossings with croatia get * really * congested . 
  oh , just give it to sweden , or something . 
  what can i say , i want eu to succeed , for the purpose of a stable europe . 
  maybe it needs to take some time for historical animosity to go away , too . 
  after all , european nations are very fierce and were more often at war with each other than not . 
  okay not the same ones every time , but there 's been a lot more war time than peace time on the continent . 
   i think it 's far harder to claim the same relationship with the eu as an entity . 
  this is true , that 's why such a thing ca n't reasonably happen as of right now . 
  but i 'm hopping for a development of a `` european '' identity over the next decade or two , and further integration . 
  have you ever tried to cross a border between slovenia and croatia in summer ? 
  as i always say when this comes up , do londoners feel cheated that their taxes are transferred to the british regions that are less developed ? 
  or maybe there was a typo on the list , and it said `` rulers of engagement '' , so they tried to measure stuff with them instead of following them . 
  well , i suppose it 's the same with slovenia being `` traitors '' since we were the first to declare independence ( one whole day ahead of croatia ! ), 
  yeah , i know . 
  pipe dreams and all , but hopefully it will happen before the entire project falls apart , because the current state is some sort of an unstable limbo . 
  it is . 
  english is pretty flexible when it comes to smashing sentences together . 
  but then there 's a lot of room for confusion . 
  like , is a `` demon hunter '' a hunter who hunts demons , or is it a demon who happens to be a hunter ? 
  alternatively , i hope that 's when a fiscal and tax union happens instead , so there 's transfers and common euro bonds . 
  ... well , that should n't be a problem then . 
  plenty of wankers in the world to speak up about it !, 
  `` ti '' means `` you '' here around southern slavic parts :d, 
  well , congrats !, 
  seems your bigwigs have more accountability than ours , if it was in slovenia , he 'd just cling to the position and claim it 's a media-assassination . 
  oh come on guys , * we * are constantly in disputes with croatia too !, 
  enemy of my enemy , right ? 
  i kid , of course . 
  i 'd very much like for us all to get along instead of bickering . 
  just in case ottomans decide to invade again . 
  yeah , seems that way to me too . 
  and yes , an investigation ca n't hurt . 
  that is , unless there indeed was foul play . 
  hey , we love us some mujo and haso jokes . 
  i see what you did there . 
  i approve . 
  fired ? 
  well , hopefully out of a cannon . 
  this is just dickery . 
  `` oh hey , i need a breaking story , how about i set up a shootout ? '', 
  as if the place is n't tense enough as it is . 
  no , just getting called names , which is annoying  that 's why i 'm only `` a bit annoyed '' , and not `` actually angry '' . 
   big corporation are n't `` evil '' , they see you as a customer and want to offer you the best service possible so that you do n't go away . 
  then maybe they should treat me as a customer , not a cash bag ? 
  `` best service possible '' in my case means `` you 're there * when i need you * - not * all the freakin ' time * '' . 
  if microsoft was a plumber , i would n't let that plumber crash on my couch every night to be immediately available just in case a faucet starts leaking . 
  a lot could have gone wrong with rosetta and new horizons , and we did n't really get three reports per week going `` yep , that space probe is still en route to its destination '' . 
  and i do n't think we get a news headline every time the warlords in africa do something . 
  yeah , maybe i 'm overdoing it , maybe i 'm not . 
  maybe i 'm just a bit annoyed that nuanced opinions apparently are n't allowed around here . 
  had russia decided * not * to veto it , that 'd be newsworthy , because it 'd be a new , unexpected development . 
  as it is now , the only response i have is `` well , duh . '', 
  it 's pretty damn clear that russian hardware shot the plane down and it 's an open and closed case . 
  a `` confession '' is n't really needed , and russia knows that . 
  they 're just fucking with everyone , like they usually do . 
  because it has competitors who would eat away its market share otherwise , or so they likely say . 
  doubt they 'd advertise if they were literally the only possible supplier . 
  monopolies do n't have to advertise , you take it or leave it , you ca n't go to the competitor . 
  see , if unsc was reddit , russia would be a troll . 
  one of those guys who stir up shit , and when you try to appeal to their integrity , you fail , because they simply do n't care what you think of them or how they look , so your appeal falls flat . 
  edit : typos corrected . 
  alternative ? 
  this is n't about alternatives . 
  they obviously do n't want an independent international body to investigate , and they have the power to stop such a thing from happening . 
  so they used their power to stop it . 
  they did n't veto it because they have an `` alternative '' . 
  they vetoed it because they want to keep a lid on it . 
  and again , if you did n't expect this to happen , i must say your opinion of russia is way too optimistic . 
  not russian , nor being particularly supportive of russia . 
  i just hate it when foregone conclusions are being banged up as `` big news '' . 
  it 's as if the times first page headline was * `` england beats san marino 5-0 in qualifiers !, 
  '' * why 's it a news headline ? 
  everyone knew san marino was getting trashed !, 
  it would have been news if they managed to draw . 
  so , what would ukraine do with those nukes , then ? 
  threaten to nuke its own territory ? 
  because nuking moscow would be a rather bad move , and would likely result in the immediate withdrawal of support from the west . 
  actually , you can say the same about * every politician ( head of state ) . 
  ever . 
   with nukes ukraine would quickly swept out `` green men '' and russia would n't dare to use proper invasion out out of nuclear strike retaliation how ?

  it would be quite sad if they did n't . 
  especially the netherlands . 
  my mom was almost strangled by a drunk krampus when she was a kid . 
  she 's still afraid of them . 
  we also get [ bread treats ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=parkelj+kruh&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1242&amp;bih=580&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewixvskdpphpahwdosakhqzqd5wq_auibigb#imgrc=_ ) for st. nicholas in a shape of krampus . 
  sorry , i intended to reply to u/low _ discrepancy about his video of scary masked people . 
  there are slovene schools in austria . 
   scary masked people is that for st. nicholas or shrove tuesday/sunday ? 
  they look a bit like our [ kurents ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itxand7i_u ) . 
  kurent was a pagan god of hedonism . 
  it 's a slovene tradition on shrove sunday to scare winter away . 
  again , i have never heard of anyone being forced to attend sunday lunches . 
  i 'm definitely not an exception , it looks like you just attract weird people around you . 
  it 's so bad to know our families love us . 
  we suffer so much !, 
  it 's horrible to know that if anything goes wrong you 'll always have support . 
  horrible !, 
  perhaps that 's why asthma is on the rise . 
  our moms , grandmas and aunts are suffocating us with their love and food !, 
  send help !, 
  there 's a `` march of the parkelj ( krampus ) of three lands '' festival in kranjska gora if you 're interested . 
  we do have winters ... but we also have things to heat our houses . 
  you can move right out . 
  no one asked you to live here . 
  sunday lunches are not an obsession , we 're also not the only country that does them and i have never heard of anyone being forced to attend . 
  you seem to have some deep family issues , maybe you should take care of them before spilling your shit over other people 's family connections . 
  if you take a look at the map of suicide rates and this map , you 'll be surprised to notice there 's no connection whatsoever . 
  now go pack your bags and head south . 
  not really . 
  housing was really affordable here a few decades ago but people still built houses big enough for 2 families . 
  lots of people then bought or built a weekend house . 
  my parents did n't have good paying jobs but were able to buy an apartment in the city and build a new house on a plot my dad inherited . 
  people here used to build houses with an intention one of the kids will get the upper floor . 
  when my parents were building our weekend house , they build it big enough that when they retire they 'll live in the bottom floor and me or my brother will live in the upper floor . 
  and the other one will inherit our apartment . 
  it 's pretty normal to live in the same house as your parents here . 
  so are they having a concert in slovenia or croatia ? 
  denmark or sweden ? 
  we have lots of `` country '' last names . 
  horvat , hrovat ( croatian ) , lah ( italian ) , \u010ceh ( czech ) , rus ( russian ) , \u0160vab ( schwaben , germany ) , nemec ( german ) , turk ( turkish ) . 
  it 's origin can be that their ancestors were from one of those countries , they fought against that country , they made business with that country or similar . 
  well of course not . 
  i 'm sure everyone knows that . 
  same as everyone knows not every brit turned racist after brexit and same as everyone knows roma people does n't equal romanian . 
  it 's a stupid generalization . 
  it 's easier to generalize in a sentence than adding a disclaimer `` i know not everyone this and that ... '' . 
  i mean , tons of albanians here have ties with the mafia . 
  they arrested tons of albanian mafia members here just this week . 
  we call them `` sladoljedarji '' - ice creamers with a hint of an albanian accent . 
  bakeries , kebab shops and ice cream stands . 
  it seems like every street here has an albanian bakery , which is often just a money laundering disguise . 
  just this week police raided albanian mafia at the coast . 
  our coast is pretty much run by albanian mafia . 
  it 's also not justified british ( and other ) media keeps lumping eastern europe together . 
  `` eastern europeans '' steal fish from the pond . 
  `` eastern europeans '' living in a park in front of this and that building . 
  `` eastern europeans '' stealing our jobs . 
  please , theres 2000 slovenes in the uk , 3000 tops . 
  and i bet my finger most of them are highly educated . 
  but what can you do ? 
  just accept that you know you 're not one of those being criticized . 
  sorry , i have no sympathy for you . 
  it was n't politicians that decided for brexit , it was you , brits . 
  what happened to the spirit of europe ? 
  ask your fellow countrymen . 
  does n't it take quite a few years for them to mature ? 
  i think it was said on tv they need about the same amount of time as humans to mature and that they 're still very childish right now , playing with sand , how they do that i do n't know . 
  i think they would be considered fresh teens now , not adults . 
  it 's not made up . 
  it 's a dutch agency that awards this . 
  it 's not gon na happen france . 
  his last wish was to be buried there . 
  you were offered his heart and you refused it . 
  we mostly can fruit and cucumbers . 
  also beetroot , red bell peppers and mushrooms . 
  those are usual ones , anything else depends on a family and recipes they find on the internet . 
  my mom started pickling eggplants and zuccini this year . 
   ran\u010d u zelen\u00e9 sedmy that 's it !, 
  thanks !, 
  huh ? 
  no one consideres ajvar a slovene thing . 
  why would we claim it 's ours when it clearly is n't ? 
  i think most people consider it a serbian dish . 
  so i googled it . 
  \u017divilska industrija d.o.o ( no idea who they are ) protected ` ajvar ' , only the name , on german market . 
  so it was n't slovenia that registered it but the company that was producing it and selling it in germany . 
  and you were n't able to sell it under that name in germany only . 
  when i was a kid i used to watch this series about a czech family who lived in a city and they were rebuilding their weekend house or something like that ? 
  do you know what i 'm talking about ? 
  do you remember what it was called ? 
  well , you 're spot on for slovenia . 
  what about eros ramazzotti ? 
  phew , a lot . 
  wine is as deep in our culture as hiking . 
  even poem where they took our anthem from is actually a toast . 
  and the guy who wrote it was a very big fan of drinking wine lol . 
  some that i remember at the moment ( all of these are considered national songs ) : [ kol ` kor kapljic , tol ` ko let ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnnk67uw_a ) . 
  rough translation : as many as there are ( wine ) drops , as much years god give us to live . 
  hey , o ' hey , o ' hey , to this world . 
  whether she 's old or whether she 's young , all of them like guys .

  you have the hague conventions/geneva conventions etc. 
  it 's not about a type of weapon ( expect chemical weapons ) , from what i know but it 's mostly about intent when bombing . 
  but feel free to correct me and show me an article in the treaties that deals with `` indiscriminate weapons '' and how using them constitutes a war crime . 
  if this was the case , then basically all countries would be commiting war crimes , since it 's mostly the usa that only use `` smart bombs '' . 
  and even the us did n't use them in the gulf war , it 's only recently that the us use exclusively those . 
  why is a bunch of bombs falling a proof of war crimes ? 
  it 's a war memorial and burial site of many civilians and soldiers . 
  nothing about it is `` commie '' . 
  and i dont think it has anything to do with the statue of liberty . 
  japan was at war with germany in ww1 and de facto part of the allies/entente . 
  do you really need to use nazi terms ? 
  the russian minority in lithuania is insignificant , unlike in estonia and latvia . 
  then they should n't sign agreements they do n't plan to implement . 
  minsk 2 required almost no action from russia . 
  it required constitutional reform in ukraine however , which was n't done . 
  the concept of `` ever closer union '' was clearly stated in the treaty of rome 1957 and repeated in later eu texts , so you should have known what you are joining . 
  the concept of `` ever closer union '' was clearly stated in the treaty of rome in 1957 . 
  and it was repeated in eu texts ever since , so it should n't come as a surprise to you . 
  i am certainly not worried and welcome this initative . 
  care to provide a source for 50 + civilians a day ? 
  axis refers to the signatories of the tripartite pact , an actual treaty of alliance . 
  they ( japan-germany-italy as well as others ) themselves referred as the axis at that time already . 
  zlo means evil , so zlovenia is a play on words , an evil version of slovenia . 
  slovenia actually declined the invitation to join in the 90ies , when the v4 was being set up . 
  can you link the source of this ? 
  1938 are mostly guesswork , especially for eastern europe since the ussr did n't compute anything for the various republics , and gdp is n't a very good concept for an essentially isolated , planned economies . 
  gdp also as a concept was n't really introduced and computed until post ww2 or even later . 
  gdp was n't really a developed measure in 1938 and not computed . 
  these figures are mostly guesswork . 
  our national anthem is a part taken out of a drinking song . 
  export composition is n't really a problem . 
  if you check australia 's or norway 's , it 's similar to russia . 
  he did n't ally with any slavic nation . 
  croatians were deemed to be goths not slavs according to their fantastic theories . 
  read this for genocide olympics of this type : http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2011/03/10/hitler-vs-stalin-who-killed-more/, 
  if inheritance was part of the issue , then the adoption of children of gay couples was probably legislated by a different law than adoption by hetero couples . 
  adoption implies full and equal rights of the adopted child to a biological child , including of filiation and inheritance and such , which are most important . 
  what was the actual difference then , between a same sex union and actual gay marriage ? 
  just the name ? 
  or were there any rights that were left out in the sex same union ? 
  gay marriage is controversial because it allows gay couples to adopt children on equal terms as a hetero marriage couple , it 's not about fucking . 
  this map is about fucking . 
  he 's actually leftist , unlike the rest . 
   the most likely result of an attack on sweden is an eu nato member comes to it 's defense and declares article 5 on some technicality bringing in the rest of nato . 
  officially though if russia were to take gotland or something nato would have no responsibility to help and the eu does not promise direct military support so sweden could just get screwed over . 
  article 5 is usually understood , that you have to invaded into your territory for it to be triggered ; article 6 clarifies this . 
  i certainly would n't support helping any countries outside of nato , just like they would n't support any countries inside of nato . 
  if you want your cake and eat it too , join nato . 
  i just do n't think its `` barely '' , that was my point . 
  it 's quite alot faster , and if you normalized your graph , you 'd see poland almost tripled in that timeframe , while sweden not even doubled . 
  and relative changes are what 's important eventually if you deal with exponential growth . 
  edit : e.g a graph like this would be more to the point : https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=6cka poland grew 150 % since 1990 , while sweden grew 46 % in the same period . 
  and sweden barely grew since 2008 , while poland keeps on going . 
  asylum seekers do n't count . 
  gdp is about residents , i.e. 
  those that get a residence permit and can work , so thats moot . 
  sweden has alot of legal immigration from the eu . 
  anyway , if its barely for you then ok . 
  i dont consider one year out of the whole time series i posted in which sweden posted a higher growth rate `` barely '' , which is also when sweden rebounded from the 2008-09 slump . 
  and in 3 of those years sweden posted negative growth . 
  the blue line , to me , is clearly and not barely above the red one here : https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=6ctx, 
  they 're growing faster than sweden , when you factor per capita growth . 
  thats what matters , since their population is stagnating and will probably start decreasing in a few years . 
  sweden population is just growing alot , so it 's easier to post nice growth figures . 
  see eg : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshtableaction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=tsdec100&amp;language=en edit : change into growth rates , in the unit section, 
  a quick search yields this data : https://data.oecd.org/lprdty/gdp-per-hour-worked.htm if you click `` table '' you find data . 
  it 's base year is 2010 , so its standardized to be 100 per country . 
  uk gdp/hour worked is 100,64 in 2014 , us is even less , at 100,2 . 
  germany is at 103,6 . 
  it 's actually no surprise , uk population grew something short of 10 % in 2007-2015 , while posting mediocre growth . 
  that 's why people should n't be surprised , like they were in some thread here on / r/europe some days ago , when the data showed their real wages declined about 10 % in 2007-2015 period . 
  that 's also why its always misleading when people show gdp declines in japan . 
  obviously it 's declining , because their population is declining , but if you measure per capita or per hour worked , it 's growing fine , and in line with other developed countries . 
  i do n't have the `` annual growth/change '' as an option in the measure section , and the gdp is in pps, 
  they are n't . 
  uk/us data is skewed because their population grows by 1 % or so a year . 
  when you compare per capita growth , or per hour worked , it 's more or less the same . 
  it 's just finland , baltics and poland that should be in the belt, 
  slovenia is n't russia . 
   advocate changing of the borders by violence . 
  he 's asking for a plebiscite , not violence . 
  go buy some reading comprehension, 
  germany ca n't have more than 370k troops by treaty . 
  wheres the studies or even a summary of them ? 
  the clip does n't have anything to do with the title . 
  http://www.worldeconomics.com/data/madisonhistoricalgdp/madison%20historical%20gdp%20data.efp data collected by a very famous economic historian . 
   also , consumers do n't work that way . 
  big companies maybe , or banks , but the average consumer is not going to say ` ill buy this bread tomorrow when it 's 1c cheaper ' or wo n't fill up his empty tank today because it might be cheaper tomorrow . 
  i never said consumers delay consumption or whatever . 
  only that you can save , or rather get a positive return merely by keeping your savings in cash . 
  which you ca n't do if there 's inflation and people have to circulate/invest the money if they want a positive return . 
  not really , if you admit that qe does anything to inflation , then you can do more to inflation by doing more qe . 
  they can hire some advisors from mugabe 's zimbabwe if they 're having trouble engineering inflation . 
  the failure of the ecb was mainly done in 2011 when they started raising interest rates , and began qe 7 years after the fed and boe . 
  they are n't . 
  it 's a failure of monetary policy by the ecb . 
  the problem is that you can save by hoarding cash when there is deflation . 
  that is , you have a positive return on cash , equaling the level of deflation . 
  in an inflationary environment , you save by depositing the cash in a bank or something similiar . 
  which means you save by investing in the real economy , since you help the bank with lending with your deposit .

  you can do all mentioned from whichever eu country . 
  about internships : you should just apply , you do n't really need much international experience to get in . 
  make sure you have an extra good cv ( that means that you spend like days on it not hours ) and that your motivation letter is top notch and is all good . 
  about languages : in brussels you can get by with french only . 
  eu has 3 working languages ( english , french and german ) . 
  for most jobs , speaking one of these is a minimum requirement and for some they want more languages . 
  but if you have any true wish of working in any kind of international environment like nato , un , eu . . you really should learn a language . 
  i mean you really have no excuse there . 
  ok so you are paying more then you are getting ( like 8 other countries ) but you do have a rebate that is covered by other ms. 
  so you tell me now , do you really honestly think that the eu is bad for uk and that uk is worse of outside the eu ? 
  do you really see the romanticism of a spring of democracy in boris johnson and nigel farage ? 
  and so what is this different future that you speak of ? 
  how is eu so horrible to you ? 
  and yes , of course your own currency is beneficial to you . 
  i am not ignorant of fiscal and monetary policies . 
  but poland that does not want the euro cuz they are cheaper without it , will have to take euro eventually . 
  whereas uk will probably just change money with a new king ( i imagine ? 
  i am not really familiar with royalty . 
  we do n't have any . ), 
  look man i feel you . 
  brexit and trump go hand in hand in 2016 . 
  i understand your need to justify what uk did . 
  but after-brexit has reveled it was not anti eu the british were really voting . 
  because i honestly believe , that people that have an insight in the eu from an additional angle besides money , do not find eu detrimental to uk . 
  well , i can tell you that writing ad hominem attacks makes you look weak . 
  because you do n't know who you are taking with whereas i can safely rely on stereotypes when describing a whole fucking nation . 
  and i am not mad at uk for leaving the eu . 
  i just genuinely dislike the country . 
  and i was there before ( not that it makes me an expert or anything but i know of and have been in the uk ) . 
  how uk treats eu from the very beginning i have a problem with . 
  and imho uk should not have joined in the first place . 
  so uk leaving is really not sad for me per se . 
  also the things i mentioned are not from the past - uk is still not in schengen , still has a rabate and still does not have euro . 
  also these things are around from the 90s so it 's not like eu has suddenly become ` incompatible with the views of today ' . 
  it was right wing bullshit propaganda that won with misconceptions and lies . 
  do n't read into it too much ... 
   honestly , that 's a load of nonsense , but what do i know i 'm british and therefore a dick right ? 
  nice generalising there . 
  i think you might be a hypocrite . . bitch please do you know how much generalization my part of eu gets from you british all the time ? 
  or should i mention your campaign about bulgarian , romanian and polish people ? 
  excuse * me * for generalizing . . 
  i am just another random person on the internet not a public figure ...  are you saying that the uk must subdue itself to the eu because the eu is giving the uk ( and other countries ) perks ? 
  no , but the uk was against eu from day one . 
  then an asshole french person did not want to let you in the eu when you asked , several times , and then finally he left and you had a referendum and joined . 
  and then you started to blackmail and sulk and said no to schengen and no to euro and got a rabate and were against making the eu bigger and were against making in tighter until you just did not even pretend you care anymore and left . 
   what if they want what 's best for their country and they think that exists outside the eu ? 
  the best for uk is to stay in eu . 
  the best for eu to be a tighter union , is that uk leaves . 
  i was not campaigning for uk to leave ( and i did not say that ) , but we already started talking about brexit a bit and the future between eu and uk two and my stance was what i have just written . 
  also i am sorry if you feel offended , it is not in any way meant personal what i wrote . 
  but as a nation ? 
  you 're assholes . 
  you 're just in luck atm that your cousins just elected an even bigger orange asshole ... 
  i do n't hate them , i just think they are entitled selfish ignorant dicks . 
  but that is british for you , nothing new there . 
  also i do not mind self-determination of nations . 
  but what uk did with eu was a dick move since they already had extra and more than other eu countries yet they were the ones loud about it . 
  but do n't get me wrong , i was arguing for uk to leave the eu already 4 years ago . 
  except is uk a family member or like a dick boyfriend of a cousin you do n't like anyway ? 
  no , because you clearly have no clue of the difference between minorities and nations . 
  also as far as i know , there is absolutely no effort from catalans in france to get a country . 
  about basks and on i am not up to date with the situation but sure . 
  i do n't see why people should not have their own country if they decide so . 
  glocalization much ? 
  are you sure you 're describing americans with ubi and hatred for capitalism and banking ? 
  as a nato member not really excited since we have to send our soliders and spend our money for us wars , that we have zero actual interest in . 
  as a pacifist i can not even ... 
  fluently ( as in i can work in this language ) slovenian , english , italian , german , beginner french . 
  passively spanish , croatian/serbian , 
  moore made a great point about this in where to invade next . 
  it is punishment enough that you can not be in your normal environment leading a normal life . 
  no need for brute force , violence , forced labor , unhumane conditions like the us is trying to bully obedience instead of trying to achieve the purpose of prisons - to resocialize people to be a functional part of society . 
  but it order for that to work prisons can not be private and run for profit especially if you ** have ** to provide them with prisoners by contract . 
  i started when i was 11 , a lot of my school mates were smoking as well . 
  i stopped when i was 16 ... 
  despite popular belief , i was actually a straight a student and ( still ) care ( ed ) about school . 
  i think now is a bit stricter though . 
  al least i hope getting cigarettes is not as easy . 
  it is not that we were buying them , but we somehow always got them from older kids , parents and so on . 
  ok so let me recap : from all that i have written you read and took just my last sentence ? 
  and then went on to produce the stupidest argument against independent catalonia i have ever heard . 
  your argument is that they can not have their own state cuz some of them feel spanish ? 
  what kind of bullshit argument is this ?!, 
  if it were that simple then why do n't you just allow a referendum like an actual democratic country and let people who live in that area decide if they feel more spanish or more catalonian . 
  if they decide to stay ( like scotland did the first time ) you win and have at least two more generations to throw this in their faces . 
  if they leave , you win cuz according to you , you do n't have to pay for them anymore . 
  so why did your government decide not to allow a referendum ? 
  i am talking about a law that was accepted four years ago asshole . 
  i doubt you went to elementary school starting in 2014-15 . 
  but then i am the one who has no clue . 
  also i did not say you should get a public official speaking catalan to you in madrid . 
  but even in my country , where we have 2000 people big italian minority , italian is still an official language written in our constitution . 
  ok so first i replied to the first comment and than saw the blog post after answering . 
  so that is why i did n't refer to it . 
  second i do n't need to prove myself to you so stop with the ad hominem attacks . 
  i am trying to have a conversation with a random person on the internet . 
  no need to get personal . 
  about terminology : dully noted , i am writing this on my phone on vacation so i did not go google the proper english term , just used the one suggested by my phone . 
  i will use catalans from now on . 
  i will reply to a random blog post from the internet .

  1000 is plenty if you have a representative sample . 
  this study has a self-selecting sample and i do n't see any indication that the final average was weighed for age/gender/socioeconomic status etc. 
  again , depends on the motivation . 
  did they endorse the charity fund as an attempt to humanise themselves ? 
  then no . 
  did they endorse the charity fund because a board member is a white supremacist ? 
  then yes . 
  `` people like me '' ? 
  no , by my logic ,  the nazis think endorsing mickey mouse is beneficial to their cause they may endorse a cartoon mouse for purely strategic reasons or because their analysis of the situation is wrong , but there is still some type of motivation behind the decision to endorse that is worth looking into . 
  with navalny , he has courted nationalists all his political career - that may or may not have influenced sputnik & pogrom 's decision to endorse . 
  no but it does mean the nazis think endorsing mickey mouse is beneficial to their cause, 
  correct , pretty much everyone in luxembourg is at least trilingual because their kindergartens are luxembourgish , their primary schools are taught in german , high schools are german/french and uni is french .

  we hate each other more than we hate black people, 
  i think part of the statistical difference is down to what 's considered `` leaving the parental household '' by a country 's statistical office . 
  here in slovenia , when students move out to go to college , their place is registered as a `` temporary residence '' and their parents ' place is still listed as their `` primary residence '' so it would n't be reflected in the statistics as `` having left your parent 's place '' . 
  judging by your description , it 's different in the nordics .

  he apparently still personally advises putin in some capacity but since 2011 , he has had very little influence on overall political strategy . 
  here are a couple of articles talking about it : http://akarlin.com/2013/05/surkov-fired-for-bolotnaya/ ( this is a translation of a vedomosti article ) http://www.interpretermag.com/why-vladislav-surkov-was-fired/ i also recommend [ this article by marlene laruelle ] ( https://www.academia.edu/28713012/_the_izborsky_club_or_the_new_conservative_avant-garde_in_russia_the_russian_review_75_no._4_2016_626-644 ) ( she is a russian studies scholar whose work is actually really on point most of the time ) , which talks about the rivalry between surkov and the izborsky club . 
  the latter won out , which explains the kremlin 's turn towards conservatism and eurasianism since 2011 . 
   tensions have flared up in the last 3-4 years . 
  no this is patrick, 
  vladislav surkov does n't play that huge of a role in the administration anymore , he was demoted after the 2011 protests ( reportedly putin was furious with him ) . 
  point taken , but vardarska on its own just sounds weird to me, 
  she kicked her father out of the party in an attempt to clean up her party 's image and disassociate it from anti-semitism . 
  jalkh 's appointment suggests her efforts were less than thorough . 
  also this piece is worth of discussion because of [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/bfmtv/status/857520870620897280 ) if not anything else, 
  yeah that 's pretty common everywhere, 
  vardarska is an adjective , it 's like calling greece `` the hellenic '' .

  albanians made up over 25 % of the population according to the 2002 census and there 's no way their numbers have fallen , especially not to 17 % . 
  consider the following : * a disproportionate share of albanians is underage and so ca n't vote in the first place * as mentioned , voter turnout is much lower in albanian areas * albanian parties got 23 % of the vote in 2008 , so the drop in voter share is probably due with the dissatisfaction with their parties rather than anything else, 
  you ca n't infer the albanian population size from the election results , voter turnout is much lower in albanian areas and not everyone votes along ethnic lines, 
   and what the fuck was their fucking police doing the whole time ???

  vmro are just facing the prospect of losing power and having many of its members prosecuted for corruption . 
  they 've grown increasingly desperate since the election , they even got ted fucking cruz ( lmao ) to complain to the us secretary of state about how soros was secretly controlling the opposition . 
   do they deny parties from member states from joining them ? 
  yes they 're under no obligation to take everyone in & have the power to throw out anyone who misbehaves, 
  currently albanian is only the administrative language in municipalities where over 20 % of the population is albanian . 
  albanians argue that the threshold is too high , that the data used is outdated ( the last census was 15 years ago and the albanian population has grown since ) and that albanians should have the right to communicate with the authorities in their mother tongue regardless of where they live . 
  furthermore recognising albanian as an official language would be a symbolic gesture of recognition that albanians are an integral part of the country . 
  [ us embassy condemns violence , backs the election of xhaferi as legitimate ] ( https://twitter.com/usembassymkd/status/857690559842050048 ),

  i know , right ? 
  not to mention oettinger , tajani , forza italia ( when it existed ) , epp is a cesspool . 
  no , they were invited to apply by verhofstadt 's circle ( obviously not officially but there had already been a written agreement prepared but then alde members revolted ) ( [ this is a relatively good appraisal of the situation , it mentions the agreement and gives background to the situation ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/guy-verhofstadt-bridge-too-far-alde-5-star-movement-beppe-grillo-european-parliament/ ) ), 
  albanians did n't start this, 
  i just want to point out that vmro is an epp associate member, 
  did you find that in a fortune cookie ? 
  because vmro is trying to start shit, 
  we 're talking about treaty violations in general , not just article 7 violations, 
  why does someone always come into macedonia posts looking to start shit like this ? 
  we 've been over this a million times , this post is about a serious matter and you 're not even from the area , so gtfo, 
  [ this is what they did to him ] ( https://twitter.com/whitegandalfthe/status/857657277599416322 ), 
  it very nearly happened in 2001 , so anything 's possible . 
  i do n't think she ever even officially met or interacted with varoufakis . 
   if the values have been codified into law we will be able to point at the law orban has broken , and bring it to court ... or we wont because he 's not violating the law . 
  there have been plenty of provisions in eu treaties and accords that member states have repeatedly and deliberately broken ( the fiscal compact comes to mind ) and still were n't punished because it was n't politically expedient . 
  spain got away with breaking the deficit rule pretty much solely because sch\u00e4uble lobbied commissioners not to enforce fines on his buddy rajoy . 
  so as long as fidesz has epp backing , nothing will be done . 
   other people would characterize that as being able and willing to drive consensus . 
  re : the willingness to drive consensus : there 's a difference between achieving a workable compromise and straight-up going against your stated beliefs , and verhofstadt has done plenty of the latter re : the ability to drive consensus : at least with his ep president bid , that failed spectacularly , and he once again betrayed his stated values by backing tajani over pittella once he was out just because the epp promised him the brexit negotiator position . 
  oh the epp effectively begged fidesz to join ( fidesz used to be part of the liberal international , of which orb\u00e1n used to be vice president , go figure ) . 
  the epp wanted to secure influence in eastern europe before the 2004 expansion and basically courted parties based on their size and power rather than ideological similarity . 
  there were plenty of warning signs about fidesz before it joined the epp , but the leadership was willing to put up with pretty much anything as long as it meant the balance of powers on the eu level remained in their favour ( which is also why berlusconi 's forza italia was a member and why certain countries where the right is fragmented have several , even half a dozen parties in the epp ) . 
  the konrad adenauer foundation ( which is a cdu think tank ) in particular was instrumental in getting fidesz to join and the hanns seidel foundation ( a csu think tank ) has even given orb\u00e1n the franz josef strauss prize ( which is a lifetime achievement award for politics ) , so while the relations with merkel have n't been the best , fidesz still has plenty of friends in germany ( csu moreso than cdu ) . 
  imo it will take a lot more for the epp to expel fidesz . 
  if not anything else , fidesz has 12 meps , which does n't sound like a lot , but the epp only has a couple dozen more meps than s&d . keeping fidesz on board basically ensures that the epp can stuff its people into senior positions ( ep president etc ) and for many in the epp , that alone makes keeping fidesz around worth it . 
  as for what 's in it for fidesz , obviously it wields a lot more influence as part of the epp than the ecr ( especially since the tories are going to be out of the picture soon ) , so unless something drastic happens , both sides benefit from this arrangement . 
   my point is just that government is very prone to error in picking infant industries to subsidize , and therefore should refrain from doing so . 
  all r&d investment is very prone to error but the state is actually surprisingly good at driving innovation as mariana mazzucato 's work has shown . 
  i recommend * the entrepreneurial state * in particular . 
  did this really need to be a post, 
  and let 's not forget the time he tried to partner up with bepe grillo to get himself elected as president of the european parliament . 
  verhofstadt would sell his soul for a nickel . 
  in either case , this has nothing to do with protectionism in the first place ( protectionism means protecting industries against foreign competition , which does n't apply to hydrogen cars/tesla to begin with ) , so i do n't know why you 're bringing it up . 
  i 'm just saying , tesla is n't a good example of a self-made success story . 
   ( imagine we 'd propped up hydrogen cars or something , we might not have gotten tesla ) tesla and other musk businesses have received $ 5 billion in goverment subsidies . 
  labelling every protectionist measure under the sun as extremist is a bit much , though . 
  to use another example , the german trade school system has long been criticised by the imf as rent-seeking in nature ( because the licencing system restricts market access to trade school graduates ) and arguably protectionist ( since labourers from places without a comparable system are automatically excluded from the market ) , yet calling people who want to keep the school system as-is `` extremists '' , well ... that would certainly be a first in my book . 
  huh ? 
  i mean that 's pretty thoughtful of him .

  what ? 
  islam currently has almost no geopolitical power . 
  no major superpower is islamic . 
  in fact currently all three major `` sabre-rattling '' powers ( usa , russia , china ) have big problems with muslim extremists .

  of course . 
  the whole europe was gearing up for a major war , however it was k&k that pressured and attacked serbia , and germany that violated belgian neutrality to open the western front . 
  i 'd love a flag similar to the [ flag of of ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/flag_of_the_liberation_front.gif ) , except with triglav being a bit smaller and with three yellow stars instead of the of & the red star . 
  imo almost anything is better than our current monstorsity with the awful coat of arms on it . 
  ( i also like our [ old flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_slovenia#/media/file:flag_of_sr_slovenia.svg ) , but it might upset people . ), 
   which is bullcrap though . 
  wwi was caused by serbia being dicks and assassinating a guy . 
  i ca n't believe that the central powers get blamed for starting the war when they invaded serbia . 
  the serbian government did not assassinate ff . 
  it was an yugoslavist movement called mlada bosna , which sought to unify the yugoslav people . 
  this is not what triggered the war . 
  the war was triggered when the serbian government refused the ultimatum presented by k&k , which was intentionally made as unreasnoble as possible , to allow k&k to go to war . 
  the ultimatum was a series of 10 demands created to destroy most of serbian sovereignty , and their influence in the balkans . 
  the reason central powers get blamed is because the germans fully supported k&k in its decision to pressure serbia . 
  k&k could not afford a war against serbia and russia , so it had to have german support , which it got . 
  i 've had a similar experience in the adriatic sea . 
  an unpolluted night sky is an incredible sight .

  before you dabble too much in your outlandish theories , you should know that he was a member of mlada bosna , which was a bosnian-serb organisation . 
  you 'll notice that bosnia was occupied by kuk at the time . 
  you 'll also notice that kuk was increasing the pressure on serbia as well . 
  so apparently i 'm a troll because i do n't belive that an european government , made mostly of german , french and british politicians , will be better for me than a local national one . 
  both kingdom of shs , and kingdom of italy were democratic for large periods of time during their rule over our lands . 
  it did n't make things much better . 
  democracy is not some magic cure that prevents opression . 
  in many cases it enables it . 
  people did n't like it when they were ruled by vienna , they did n't like it when they were ruled from belgrade ( not counting tito ) , and they certainly did n't like it when they were ruled from rome ( or berlin ) . 
  i do n't see how we 'll like it to be ruled from brussels . 
  and while i 'm sure larger states ( germany , france , uk ) can maintain their sovereignty , smaller states have no chance . 
  we 're getting pushed around enough as is . 
  those were penal units , not a general tactic on the eastern front . 
  that article reffers to about 500k men in such units ( the number is unsourced , by the way ) . 
  even 500k men is a small figure when comparing the casualities of western and eastern fronts . 
  that whole article makes a whole lot of unsourced claims , making me very reluctant to belive it whole . 
  i 've heard of the damn lend lease . 
  i 'm asking you to cite the numbers .

  and please do n't link me a whole wiki article again . 
  give me at the least a specific paragraph or , you know , an actual historical peer reviewed source . 
   ussr contributed more because they had a penchant for sending their poorly trained and equiped troops into the meatgrinder give me a source on that happening on a large scale please . 
   during the early war soviet russia relied almost entirely on lend-lease material built in the us and shipped from and by the uk . 
  ^ [ citation ^ needed ]  even during the late war nearly 100 % of soviet trains and trucks were built in the us . ^ [ citation ^ needed ],

  america had no nuclear arms before mid-45 and even then they only had 2 . 
  if germany and ussr had not gone to war , or if germany won in 41 ( the only realistic time they could have won ) , than the war in europe would be over by 42-43 , considering the difference in manpower on both fronts .

   the contents of your speech are irrelevant . 
  that is completely false . 
  libel is a crime mostly everywhere . 
  because the economies of western nations shifted to create different jobs . 
  i disagree . 
  the decline of the worker class is directly correlated with globalisation . 
  as workers gained rights in europe more and more companies shifted old workers jobs to places where the costs were lower ( ie places with no worker rights ) . 
  i saw that happening , but he mentioned something about mods of / r/russia, 
   at first i thought they could n't take a joke but after reading reactions as these i can hardly blame them for distancing themselves . 
  context ? 
  did i miss something on 1.4 ? 
  agreed . 
  with the rise of globalisation and the decline of the european worker class , the left wing parties all over europe , looking for voters , have adopted the neo-liberal economic model and and shifted from appealing to the poor to appealing to middle-class liberals . 
  that 's not even close to being as bad as ksa .

   where did you link it ? 
  sory abot that . 
  my bad , i was thingking of a nother thred . 
   how does that make them native ? 
  the restored republic recognised the pre-occupation citizens or descendants from such ( including the long-term russian settlers from earlier influxes , such as lake peipus coast and the 10,000 residents of the petseri county ) [ 23 ] the citizenship act provides the following requirements for naturalisation of those people who had arrived in the country after 1940 , [ 24 ] the majority of whom were ethnic russians : knowledge of the estonian language , constitution and a pledge of loyalty to estonia . 
  [ 25 ] the government offers free preparation courses for the examination on the constitution and the citizenship act , and reimburses up to 380 euros for language studies judging from this image : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russians_in_estonia#/media/file:russophone_population_in_estonia.png regions like ida-viru deffinatly have a native russian population . 
  especialy since all russian settlement before 1940 are considered native by aparanet estonian law , as described by this wiki . 
  do you not know hoe to use hiperlinks ? 
  i linked this a few comments ago : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russians_in_estonia , i have read it .

  i 'd like to see some actual numbers on this , rather than a simple assertion . 
  switzerland is nowhere near the most densely populated area in the world , which means there is a proven way of making things work , right ? 
  just checked and it is n't april yet in case anyone else was wondering . 
  i 'm just thinking out loud here , but could n't you just ad a carriage to trains that are overcrowded , a lane to roads here and there , and i do n't even know what overcrowded cities means , anyone ? 
  i 've been watching to fucking much american tv, 
  if that 's the case , then i 'm with the yanks . 
  i did n't get that impression though . 
   maybe you and i disagree over what exactly was meant when that official said `` fuck the eu '' . 
  yes , and your description of my view is spot on . 
   i do n't know . 
  but they should be doing something . 
  see , that 's where we drift apart . 
  i do n't think we should be doing something just so we 're doing something , especially when that something may well have unpredictable consequences . 
   they should make it look like they have some sort of plan ... 
  i think that there should actually be a plan , but it 's unclear to me what that could be at this point . 
  we 're clearly not willing to commit the money that would be necessary to swing the ukrainian economy 180 \u00b0 to the west and the infrastructure is not in place to displace russian gas supplies at this point . 
  on top of that , there 's a large portion of the population which still supports the eastward policy vector and the entire country is in dire need of reforms , which will be economically painful for ordinary people no matter what . 
  unless the ecb is about to start printing money for ukraine , i do n't really see an endgame here . 
  any pretence in the absence of the real thing would be torn down by the kremlin in short order . 
  i did n't say that this was a position of the us , but i object to this position since it was the one expressed as far as i can see while the point about squabbling etc. 
  may be valid in some general sense , it really does n't apply here in my opinion . 
  the situation is difficult and fraught with peril . 
  there is no simple multiple choice style set of options that we could choose from . 
  while i 'm aware of the existence of sins of omission , i think that treading lightly is the wise thing to do here . 
  what exactly is it that the eu should be doing in your opinion ? 
   the eu needs them ** as much ** as they need the eu . 
  i mainly agree with your point , but there is certainly a massive asymmetry there . 
  sry , misclicked and subsequently edited, 
  were you thinking of something specific or did you just want to drop off a flaming bag of passive aggressiveness devoid of any substantive value ? 
  the thought of the eu being sidelined by the us of all `` people '', 
  to be fair , the russian hand is a hell of a lot stronger to begin with ; they control the majority of ukraine 's gas , are as big an export market for ukrainian gods as the eu , and have control over big chunks of the value chain of ukrainian industry , which landed on the russian side of the border in '91 the fact that they also have massive amounts of cash on hand also helps . 
  the word does n't bother me , the thought , however , does .

  the cuba embargo is just as reprehensible as the ukraine sanctions . 
  add to that the fact that the russian action was a clear violation of wto rules and that it has been effective and you can understand why it has a extra element of tragedy to it .

  the domestically fracked gas does n't need to be imported, 
  my main problem with it is that the fuel needs to be imported . 
  btw , i think that coal is waaaaaay worse . 
  i 've sent them a note and they 've already said `` s\u00f3rry . '', 
  true , but that does n't automatically make these findings false . 
  well , you could always increase the price of carbon to maintain current gas prices and use the collected money to finance ... well anything from debt reduction to renewables to climate resilience to r & d. . . . 
  can someone who knows this stuff please explain why fracking and renewables are incompatible ? 
  i mean , could n't you just use the gas to replace coal and nuclear while still growing renewables ? 
  the fact that prices fluctuate constantly does n't change the fact that the average price of a mwh in 2013 was less than in 2012 ... 13 % less, 
  if this is such a big deal , why not divert the welfare tax of recent movers into a common fund for a year and finance their benefits from it . 
  of course it may be a bit aukward when the fund begins to turn a profit, 
  as a practical point , how effective is prohibition anyway ? 
  it makes people feel better to make drugs illegal ( except the ones they happen to be using ) , but does it actually solve more problems than it creates in terms of public health ? 
  high flying moral principles do n't really work well in public health . 
  needle exchange programmes are a no-brainer health wise , but morally ... well , you get the picture . 
  making drugs illegal inevitably creates quality problems leading to complications ( which cost healthcare money ) , it finances organised crime leading to violence ( which costs healthcare and law enforcement money ) , it creates further stigma around addiction leading to less early treatment seekers ( costing healthcare money ) , it increases drug prices and creates uncertainty in the supply chain leading to additional stress for addicts who then use more as a result ( costing healthcare money ) , and it leads to theft and other anti social behaviour to finance almost impossible to resolve addictions ( costing law enforcement money and general social problems ) ... it 's better to educate people about the dangers of drugs accurately so that less of them get addicted and help those who do as opposed to punishing them it may not feel good , but it produces better results, 
  that 's a sincere question , we barely remember what it looks like anymore :*(,

  rest of the day i have been watching 30 rock with my boyfriend . 
  slovenes students also go home every weekend because there still have friends , activities or they hate ljubljana ( and ljubljana it 's not even a big city ) . 
  that is possible because slovenia is really small and distances are not big .

  eastern europe has negative connotation that is why so many countries are not really glad when somebody mentions them as eastern . 
  many ignorant foreigners think that eastern europe means commie blocks , dangerous areas , stray dogs and vodka but i hope they will soon see that most of these countries are actually nice and interesting and pretty developed so i hope one day eastern europe will not have negative connotation anymore . 
  i agree that it can be different interpretations of celebration . 
  that is my interpretation of celebration - do something in theme of that holiday or go somewhere because of that . 
  well everyone i know ( both religious and non-religious ) at least have christmas tree or some kind of decorations and maybe have christmas dinner . 
  but that is not because jesus was born but because it 's tradition and it looks pretty . 
  i agree that 1st of may is largely celebrated but i do n't think that so many people attend bonfires as they celebrate christmas . 
  i 've attended that when i was younger ( yay another reason for party ! ), 
  but not in recent years . 
  i think christmas is the most important because both religious and non-religious celebrate it . 
  others are not so celebrated . 
  people just care that they are work free days .

  well a reason that some people were so against it is also right wing propaganda : they will took children , women will be a tool for reproduction , there will be gender theory in schools , there will not be mum and dad anymore only person 1 and person 2 and so on . 
  i think that is the main reason why law was rejected .

  polish sounds to me more like czech with lots of \u017e\u017e\u017e\u0161\u0161\u0161\u0161 and so on .

  i 'm sad that there is very little cooperation about this problem . 
  i was not impressed by krakow . 
  it 's a nice city but old town is a bit too touristy . 
  i hate when people bother me with invitations to restaurants , trips and want to sell me something . 
  but otherwise i really loved off festival in katowice . 
  cheap tickets , amazing bands , normally crowded and great organization !, 
  i would love to visit zakopane and surroundings . 
  yes our tap water is amazing . 
  i only buy bottled water when i forget to bring my refillable bottle with me . 
  it happens :d, 
  well it 's not popular as it was but yes some still celebrate so called `` kresna no\u010d '' , bonfire night . 
  in slovenia we have so called `` kres '' on 30th april an evening before 1st may - international workers ' day . 
  we build big bonfires and drink alcohol . 
  back in the old days they had this kres on 23rd june and they believed that you can understand animals and plants if you got fern seed in your pocket without your knowledge . 
  we swim in so\u010da river too which has 13 degrees but this is only for a few seconds . 
  sea normally has between 22 and 25 degrees in the summer so it 's definitively swimmable . 
  i really like sigur ros from iceland ; tocotronic from germany ; repetitor , ti , bitipatibi from serbia ; \u017den , pridjevi , pun\u010dke from croatia ; klaus johann grobe from switzerland . 
  sadly that too many artists from european countries sing in english . 
  slovenian coast is a bit colder than dalmatia in croatia for example but it is still warm enough to swim . 
  i personally feel pretty safe in slovenia . 
  in my region ( upper carniola ) we use lot of slavicized german words and in white carniola they use lot of croatian words so it really depends on a region . 
  i do n't think we really have ottoman influence . 
  slovenia have the alps , the mediterranean , the karst and the pannonian plain . 
  we are really small so you can climb a mountain in the morning and swim in the sea in the afternoon . 
  we are also close to other european countries so it 's easy to go somewhere for a weekend trip . 
  i think it 's stupid . 
  they want to have equal rights , right ? 
  so they should n't have advantage because of their sexuality . 
  i do n't why is that information so important why would employer need to know what is your sexual preference i think they should judge you only based on your qualifications , experiences and performance . 
  no joke . 
  slovenia do n't have ikea yet . 
  klagenfurt it 's actually only one hour from me so it 's not that far . 
  not in my experience . 
  most of them advertise they have wifi but most of the time it does n't work or it works only in specific country ( international buses ) . 
  austria - lakes , mountains , waterfalls , woods , vienna , closest ikea 2 . 
  iceland - scenery looks special and amazing , cool sweaters 3 . 
  estonia - they are small like us,

  some people care about money and do n't really give a shit about the culture of their host country , they want welfare , mindlessly churn out some more kids and happily plod along their old ways . 
  i want migrants that actually give a shit about my country , language and culture , not fucks who retire here and still speak their own language . 
  i want people whose kids actually become slovenes and are our friends , coworkers , yet funny enough that does happen and we did n't have to throw money at them and beg them to integrate . 
  some people just do n't want to and those can pack their shit and fuck off . 
  taxes do n't magically make us entitled to every benefit there is . 
  and yeah , god forbid the society would move in a direction where construction workers are paid a decent wage . 
  slovenia is the home of slovenian people , why would it be in our interest to boost or subsidize albanian or bosnian population growth ? 
  so in this context , they 're worth less than slovenian children and thus receive should less benefits from the slovenian state . 
  no , they have a slovenian passport , but they 're not slovenians . 
  because we 're not yugoslavia . 
  too bad we 're also investing in bosnian and albanian children . 
  poor macedonia . 
  nobody is policing their thoughts , their actions however are being limited by law that governs our society . 
  if the direction of our society does n't fit their religious views , they can move to a country that 's more accommodating to their practices . 
  is that why we do n't have any referendums on immigration ? 
  fine by me . 
  i think religious people tend to interpret religious freedom very broadly and above all else , a lot of laws have been written by some very optimistic people . 
  * sigh *, 
  we have a shit ton of bosnians living here now :(, 
   representatives of belgium 's 40,000 jews and 600,000 or more muslims said the vote sent an extremely negative signal to religious minorities . 
  jewish people have israel and muslims have plenty of countries where they can practice their beliefs ... welfare wo n't be so high , but religion ought to come first for these devout people , right ? 
  fuck this . 
  spend the money on our armies to defend our borders :p, 
   this support does n't stop when the son leaves . 
  family members , particularly women , will contact relatives and friends in europe anyone caught doing this should be either instantly deported or imprisoned for aiding illegal immigration . 
  you could declare some people to be potatoes though . 
   he built a fence along the serbian border to keep refugees out and wo n't take the eu quota of those given asylum . 
  * scratches head * there 's war in serbia ? 
  you want an all black festival ? 
  may i suggest holding it in africa ? 
  i think you have a very romantic view of gypsy culture . 
  a gypsy village is basically regular houses ( bonus points for trash lying around ) , usually built without a permit on land they do n't own . 
  they often get a free pass when it comes to crime , so locals like them even less . 
  unchr pushing their propaganda again , it 's pieces like this that turned my heart to stone . 
  i do n't care anymore , toss everyone out . 
  i never said it was the most humane solution but i 'm not willing to sacrifice the stability of europe for their well-being . 
  then again , when they come here , they 're not willing to sacrifice their religion and culture either , so see if i give a damn . 
   i 've heard the word `` diversity '' repeated so many times in the local media during the days i was there that it almost felt like a mantra , a part of a religion or somehitng . 
  yes , the left has found their religion . 
  and ? 
   the group , originally from iraq , sudan , ethiopia and syria , now includes children born at the base ... seriously . 
  you have your morals , i 'll keep my society stable and live with the guilt . 
  anti-refugee ? 
  ask how many people are against financing refugee camps near conflict zones . 
  oh right , that does n't fit your agenda . 
  hell no , you take in one and they feel the need to bring in more . 
  camps near conflict zones and kill the asylum system . 
  makes sense though . 
  those poor refugees who had to flee all the way to germany to reach safety * rolls eyes *, 
  people blowing themselves up in public venues do n't count or is that racist ? 
  i do n't know , if they have a french passport , but it 's reasonably safe to assume , they 're not french . 
  because they 're clearly uncomfortable with our way of life . 
  migration should be more than just the size of a paycheck and welfare but also consider cultural values . 
  and why would it not be ok to ask people who move here to adapt to our ways ? 
  what election , you mean macron vs le pen ? 
  people do n't vote on a single issue alone , pretending le pen does n't have a decent amount of support is dangerous thinking that just might get her in power the next time elections come around . 
  i 'd say a lot of people voted in self interest , not wanting le pen to trash their country , but that does n't mean they 're accepting of muslims . 
  they 're free to move someplace where they 'll fit in more ... welfare might be a bit lower though . 
  but if you 're truly devout ... 
  charities ? 
  possibly the same ones that aid illegal immigration to eu ? 
   `` they know we are all muslims , '' says iyman . 
  `` why could n't they put us all together in tallinn ? 
  at least there we can eat halal . '', 
  oh for fucks sake , why did you come to europe then ? 
  ungrateful fucks . 
  wait another generation until one of the kids blows themselves up in a public venue , because we did n't give them enough . 
  we are pissing against the wind here by taking these people in . 
  * awkward silence as all the brown people stay *, 
  sure , but their self-interest runs counter to mine , so i 'll do what i consider rational and defend my own safety and way of life . 
  to countries which give them the best social welfare . 
   born in manchester in 1994 , the second youngest of four children his parents were libyan refugees who came to the uk to escape the gaddafi regime . 
  technically he is british . 
  not really . 
  you just need to put away the white gloves and get the chain mail ones . 
  economic migrants . 
  piss off . 
  resolve ? 
  they can move to a country which is more closely compatible with their way of life . 
  they pushed their way too far , now people are pushing back . 
  freedom of religion sounds great on paper , but the world is n't perfect . 
  religion is a choice ( if we avoid the whole child indoctrination angle ) , being gay ... somewhat less . 
  not to mention muslims in austria are immigrants , they knew they 're not moving to a muslim country and they 'd have to adapt . 
  they pushed freedom of religion too far , now locals are pushing back . 
  tough luck . 
  religion is still bound by law . 
  they 're free to be devout muslims in some other country . 
  granted , the welfare benefits might be a bit lower , but hey ... if you 're truly devout ... 
  not alarming ? 
  any number over 0 is alarming . 
  ah yeah , brown person on top , then again it 's bbc . 
  we ca n't accept everyone from war torn countries , asylum right now is way to broad . 
  mass refugee problems should be solved via camps near the affected areas . 
  chinese free shipping even for crap worth less than a buck is clearly state sponsored bullshit . 
  i heard just how much tiny packages get to our international posting sorting center , it 's way more than most other countries combined . 
  much like the people forcing their way into europe . 
  if people do n't get the polite message , escalating force is reasonable . 
  ban ngos from docking in eu .

  i keep hearing this route is supposed to be dangerous and whatnot .

  i asked him about the canadian affair and he did n't remember that happening .

  oh , we already do that like pros .

  apparently at home , convinced that dad stayed late at work . 
  if it happened at all . 
  my relative was quite an important person in that operation and he ca n't remember any incident with unprofor . 
  guy verhofstadt and his kids ? 
  there is only one god , but i ca n't really talk about it because the whole thing is supposed to be secret . 
  it 's depressed in almost every sense of the word . 
  1 ) bosniaks wo n't let srpska go without a fight . 
  2 ) if serbs go , croats will want to go too and that rather complicates matters . 
  there are still croat enclaves in bosniak territory and the other way around , so the federation split will require ... well ... some * ethnic exchange * , as karad\u017ei\u0107 nicely put it . 
  3 ) territorial problems , like br\u010dko . 
  it would be quite retarded to have a part of your country connected to the mainland only with a strip of land two kilometers wide . 
  especially if the first neighbors are extremely hostile , as bosniaks would likely become . 
  4 ) separation of srpska would be a grave breach of dayton accords , and neighboring countries are required to intervene , and they will , especially if shooting starts . 
  but on whose side ? 
  it has a huge potential to become another general balkanic bloodbath . 
  5 ) bosniak politics would lose one of the main excuses for keeping wahhabis on the leash . 
  what to do with it ? 
  it sticks like a sore thumb inside serb and croat territory , and both sides would probably try to get it and * ethnically exchange * the local bosniak population . 
  ... and so on . 
  nothing good can come from splitting bosnia . 
  german speciality since friedrich the great . 
  and when that one gets solved we are back to the square one . 
  facepalm . 
  with idiots like these one really starts to ask himself was the freedom of speech such a good idea . 
  how much is that still a factor ? 
  i imagine russians did some paving in the last 70 years . 
  they sent a formidable force of 300 invincible men . 
  `` this is budapeeeeeest '', 
  oh , together we would beat russia back relatively easily in a conventional war ( but you know that war would be nuclear , which is why it wo n't be ) . 
  the issue is that we would n't act together . 
  every second country would try to strike a backroom deal with russia . 
  it 's true , but then you had guys like visconti who tried to match the words to lips the best they could ; on the other hand , there were fellini and pasolini who deliberately left them mismatched . 
  there was a joke that fellini used to tell his actors to just count to ten out loud if they forgot their lines . 
  czechoslovakia and poland got betrayed in ww2 . 
  croatians betrayed bosniaks in the 90 's . 
  italy has an uncanny knack for starting wars on losing side and ending on winning . 
  `` be careful of your enemy once and of your friend a thousand times . '', 
  you must be gravely mistaken if you think anyone cares about finland , or any country except their own for that matter . 
  if russia decides to attack and america decides to sit out of that one europe is done . 
  and it worked so well they have n't won a single proper war from 1848 until they fell apart . 
  ( the schleswig war does n't count , prussians won that one , austrians were half-assing it from the start . ), 
  yugoslav people 's army back in business . 
  it 'd hilarious because slovenes say exactly the same thing about croatians . 
  not personally :d, 
  good morning from maribor !, 
  it 's 10:15 here , and i 'm just getting ready to start working on a teleplay in a caf\u00e9 close to my flat . 
  the weather 's nice and breezy , radio 's playing ramones and i think this will be a good day . 
  you 'll never take my leskovac barbecue !, 
  they talked about that shit on my brother 's university . 
  apparently not only they say radon is beneficial , they also claim that their radon is better than yours ( since it tends to concentrate in every basement ) . 
  exactly . 
  is n't tax already  100 % ? 
  i do n't know if anyone starts smoking purely to look cool . 
  i mean , it is a factor , but usually not the main one . 
  some smokers i know started out of rebellion . 
  i started out of boredom . 
  my grandma started to curb appetite and get thin . 
  i still get it every morning ( and i smoke about 20 a day ) . 
  automatism ? 
  yes , but also a way of coping with stress . 
  toothpicks just are n't the same , plus it 's hard to get all those particles of wood out of your mouth once you chew it well enough . 
  i actually never coughed . 
  that was also one of the reasons why i allowed myself to get hooked . 
  i thought , `` oh , this is n't so bad , i wonder what other bullshit they told me . '', 
  why do people smoke marijuana if heroin 's just as illegal ? 
  do n't forget accents . 
  filming in english would destroy local actors . 
  italian films for italian audiences do use dialects . 
  now , if you mention fellini because he filmed in an era where italians dubbed their own movies too , well ... 
  he also mismatched lip movements and voices on purpose , to make everything seem even more surreal . 
  damn . 
  macedonia just ca n't catch a break , can it ? 
  yes , exactly . 
  fuck it then . 
  there 's not much space in that country . 
  yeah , you 're probably right . 
  i never lived in a pre-ww2 building , and the new apartment blocks are basically commie blocks with fancier facades and staircases . 
  is n't that valid for every apartment building ever ? 
  the biggest difference between commie block and fancy gated block was that in commie block neighbors blamed the building for being noisy while in gated block they blamed me . 
   wait , what ? 
  commie blocks are quite cozy when properly maintained .

  it 's quite hard to have a high corruption rate when you legalize it . 
  edit : a bit off-topic , but a very popular male name , alja\u017e , used to be an uncommon surname until it was once mistakenly listed as a first name in slovenian orthography . 
   `` my book is simply a * great * , desperate call for not keeping silent about this . '' stay humble , slavoj .

  i 'm mildly disappointed . 
  ( or yugoslavs , but only in case you still do n't distinguish us  ),

  culturally , yes . 
  part of croatia not so much , but the rest and serbia , yes . 
  culture does n't have much to do with ethnicity though , it has to do with history .

  our chicken needs wings . 
   sachertorte made with nutella what ? 
  no , my mistake , i only read the math part . 
  there is no set grading , schools/teachers set percentages by themselves but it 's usually : 0 - 49 % = 1 , 50 - 62 % = 2 , 63 - 75 % = 3 , 76 - 88 % = 4 , 89 - 100 % = 5 . 
  our grading ( primary and secondary school ) is a scale 1-5 , 1 means fail , 2 means pass , ... , 5 means great . 
  general gymnasium - 13 classes in grade 1 ( 32 per week ) , 12 classes in grade 2 ( 31 hours per week ) , 13 classes in grade 3 ( 31-32 hours per week ) , 8 classes in grade 4 ( 30-34 hours per week ) . 
  there is no advanced classes . 
  if someone is above average they can choose to do after school activities in a chosen subject if it 's available and professor can give them extra stuff to do . 
  they can also attend competitions . 
  you can do certain subjects ( math , english , german and 3rd foreign languages ) at a higher level on a final matura exam . 
  yes . 
  you can choose a 3rd foreign language and maybe some others , depending on a school . 
  there are also a few after school clubs , we had english theatre , unesco , history club etc. 
  for example , but those are n't graded . 
  we have homework . 
  it all depends on a teacher . 
  yep , i enjoyed both of them a lot . 
  illegal and you can be fined 40 $ if police sees you . 
  for cyclists it 's 250 $ at red light and 120 $ at yellow light . 
  cycling on the wrong side of the road - 120 $ . 
  for cyclists it 's definitely enforced , for pedestrians idk , not many people jaywalk .

  always turkish at home , italian at a caf\u00e9 for me . 
  italians would get a headache if they knew how we drink their coffee . 
  people here bike as a hobby on weekends and holidays , not to commute . 
  we have dispersed settlements and tons of hills and weird weather condtions . 
  most people outside of the cities do n't live close to public transportation and no one wants to cycle over hills and valleys before or after work . 
  i do n't buy bottled water for home but i for sure do n't carry water bottles with me all the time and do n't go looking for public toilets to get stillwater when i 'm out and about , especially abroad . 
  when you 're travelling and thirsty and all you get is sparkling water , i guess it can get a bit annoying ? 
  there 's only a few places in me\u017eica valley i would n't consider living , not that many people live there anyway . 
  but there 's places like that everywhere . 
  the most depressing places i 've driven through recently are stretches between polj\u010dane and pod\u010detrtek in styria . 
  there 's places that have probably never seen sun along that road . 
  polj\u010dane is one trully ugly place . 
  i would n't brand the whole styria unlivable because of those few stretches . 
  but the rest is beautiful just like many places in me\u017eica valley and carinthia are . 
  another such places are tuhinj valley and so\u010da valley . 
  basically any valley in slovenia has narrow stretches . 
  i drove through ba\u0161ka grapa couple of years ago and i felt like it took me half a day to get through . 
  i wonder where those people work and how they get to work in winter . 
  that whole western part by so\u010da , on the other side of vr\u0161i\u010d and down to gorica is cut off from the rest of us . 
  i had a friend at uni from tolmin and comuting between home and lj every week was a challenge for them in winter . 
  even in summer that windy road through idria is a kill . 
  i also had a friend from radlje , do n't know if they 're considered carinthia or styria , and it took him a lot of planning to get home with public transport !, 
  he mostly used prevozi . 
  now that i 'm done with this rant i understand what you mean !, 
  it 's accessibility . 
  which is fine when you 're a kid and an adult that has a job close by but if your mind is a bit more open to the rest of the country than the next hill you see , you 're kind of doomed . 
  there 's mountains and hills , you can live there too , you know ? 
  i have a friend somewhere near slovenj gradec and it 's beautiful . 
  i lived there my whole live until recently and i have no idea what you 're talking about .

  whenever we go for a walk they follow us . 
  they 're really curious . 
  you also have black widdows , tarantulas and violin spiders and we both have ~ ~ a ~ ~ mediterranean recluse spiders .

  but they 're historically almost inseparable , one could not exist without the other . 
  they both stem from the 1848 revolutions known as the spring of nations . 
  revolutionaries back then put economic liberalism and nationalism together with demands for democracy and republican government to for what is known as traditional political liberalism in europe . 
  and even now , this is still mostly true . 
  sure the nationalistic part might have been subdued after the wwii , but it 's still there . 
  and what 's more important , both left and right leaning parties take this type of liberalism as their base . 
  here i come to my second point : because of this history , there can never be a `` liberal swing '' in europe . 
  the government can swing to either left , or right , but it ca n't swing to centre , and liberalism is considered true centre here . 
  next you we need to distinguish between `` traditional liberalism '' and modern centre parties . 
  first it 's hard to find an actual true centre party , as you 'll always `` swing '' to either left or right . 
  so most liberal parties are , as many poster already said , actually what is sometimes called `` neo-liberal '' , or as americans would call it , libertarian . 
  meaning that they subscribe to the ideas of milton friedman and chicago school of economics . 
  in slovenia parties subscribing to this type of liberalism range from centre-right to pure right . 
  and this is another point , as all of slovenian right-wing , conservative parties are member of same eu parliament party alliance , that is [ european people 's party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_people%27s_party ) . 
  this alliance is closer to us republicans , as it includes as different people , as jean-claude juncker ( president of european commission , and a pro-eu federalist ) and viktor orban ( hungarian pm and a eurosceptic nationalist similar to trump ) . 
  the second biggest alliance in european parliament is [ party of european socialists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_of_european_socialists ) , which as the name suggests are n't what we europeans would call liberal , but rather what we 'd call `` traditional left '' . 
  traditional liberal alliance called [ alliance of liberals and democrats for europe party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alliance_of_liberals_and_democrats_for_europe_party ) is only the third largest party in the european parliament . 
  and to make it even more clear , the party of european socialist is n't even the most left wing party in the european parliament , that 's [ party of european left ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_of_the_european_left ) , that consists of democratic socialist parties and communist parties . 
  and there might be a narrative , especially on internet , that euroscepticism is domain of nationalists and conservatives , but it 's as much a left-leaning idea if not more . 
  the aforementioned european left is mostly eurosceptic , but obviously for different reasons , than someone like nigel farrage or boris johnson . 
  if the right wing 's euroscepticism stems from nationalism and xenophobia , left wing 's euroscepticism stems from belief that eu is just a corporate puppet and while internationalism is in its core a good thing , it should n't be done in the way of current eu . 
  but both sides have some parts in common , that 's the so-called democratic deficit of eu and over bureaucratisation of the eu . 
  and i personally can agree with these two parts . 
  while it 's true that there 's a lot of directly or at least in-directly elected eu officials that do the actual deciding , they 're all too far removed from their `` constituents '' to actually represent them in any meaningful way . 
  so in the end , what most of eu officials represent is either the national government , or themselves and their european alliances , that are trying to push their own interests without any feedback from the people of the eu at all . 
  i was once all for eu federalisation , but i slowly developed a huge caveat for it : that it should n't , and i almost certain that it also could n't , be done under current eu system . 
  the current system is to foreign and distant from the actual citizens of eu , that it 's no wonder , that people uk googled what eu even meant after they already decided for brexit . 
  and given that you shared your political beliefs , i 'll share my as well . 
  i voted both at our national and european election for democratic socialists . 
  but that does n't mean i agree with them on most things . 
  they 're way more eurosceptical than i personally am . 
  while i believe that eu can be reformed , they think that best thing for slovenia would be to leave at least the eurozone if not eu in general . 
  i think that last time when hub gears were popular here was back in the 70 's or something . 
  now i have n't really seen any of those , but probably there is a hipster sub-group that is all into stuff like that , i do n't know . 
  here the most popular categories are : city bike , small collapsable city bike aka pony ( a now defunct slovenian brand , that is incredibly popular due to nostalgia ) , street-racing bike ( the ones you see on tour de france and stuff ) , mountain bike and fixies are also pretty popular , you have other bikes as well , but they are n't that popular . 
  one interesting sub-group is cyclocross , which are modified street-racing bikes so you can ride them off road , either like a mountain bike or in the mud ( the sub-group was developed in either belgium or netherlands where they 'd compete in incredibly muddy tracks ) . 
  i thought that 9th may was the go to wwii holiday , but the comments did n't really prove this . 
  9th may is v-e day by the way . 
  it 's what we most celebrate here , well together with 27th april , which is date of our armed rebellion against the nazis ( but not [ the fascist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tigr ) , that was years earlier but is n't memorialised for some reason ) . 
  yeah i 've heard that hollande is trying to pass very un-socialist reforms that will lower wages , and that people will retire even later . 
  so i think i support your riots . 
  i kind of wish we would have such a culture of public disagreeing with state politics , but instead people only argue about politics among themselves and only go against the government , when it 's really really bad ( or some party organises their supporters to riot ) . 
  non-fiction/philosophy : foucault . 
  i 'd especially recommend his `` trilogy '' society must be defended ; security , territory , population and birth of biopolitics . 
  especially society must be defended is incredibly contemporary for the modern age of re-emerging nationalism , racism and violence within and without societies . 
  foreign fiction : bulgakov 's master and margareta was incredibly enjoyable read , that made me rediscover my love for fiction . 
  slovenian author : in my teenage years i really liked bartol 's alamut ( always topical ) , i also liked zupan 's menuet za kitaro ( minuet for guitar on 25 shots ) , and cankar ( in general ) . 
  from poets i really like kosovel and \u017dupapn\u010di\u010d 's `` epic '' ( not by genre , but by length ) poem duma . 
  smc ( historically ps and lds ) : people who do n't really care about politics , just want country to work , and jan\u0161a ( president of sds ) to not win . 
  sds : rural , uneducated , their grandfathers were nazi collaborators . 
  think that ending socialism meant that they are the only party that should rule . 
  zl : young hipsters from the capital and other people who want to vote for an actual left-wing party . 
  sd : older leftists , mostly from the littoral region . 
  also older communists , who forgot , that it is n't the communist party any more . 
  nsi : rural , christian but think that sds is too extreme and did nothing while in power . 
  desus : retired people , seriously we have a party that 's specifically for the retired , and the worst thing they were in every parliament since they became a party . 
  zaab : literally nobody . 
  it was a fraction that splintered from ps , after the founder of ps retook the presidency , which he had to relinquish because of the corruption scandals . 
  this also triggered political crisis , as the pm of that time ( first and only female ) lost support within her own party . 
  i guess zaab wanted to capture females and various moderates . 
  they barely got into parliament and then promptly fell apart . 
  sls : rural farmers , who identify themselves as farmers first , opposite to christians who mostly vote for nsi and members of sds , who vote for sds . 
  they fell out of parliament in the last election and are pretty much a dead party at this point . 
  few other `` dead parties '' , that were historically somewhat important : sns : yugo-nostalgics who like that president of sns was one of the few to not shit on it , nationalistic right-wingers ( before they realised , that sds was the better choice ) , trolls and protest voters . 
  sms : they wanted to do what desus did , but for young people . 
  they did n't succeed . 
  zares : remnants of lds who thought that naming their party `` for real '' , in sense that this time , they 're in it for real ( because apparently they were n't in it for real during their lds years ) . 
  they targeted pretty much the same demographics as lds and currently smc . 
  dl : we 're totally not a fake party to try and get centre votes , that sds could never got on its own . 
  once they did that and secured victory for sds , they decided to `` backstab '' them and were one of the main reason that that government fell . 
  lds : while as i wrote above they had pretty much the same demographics as smc currently , they still were somewhat different in the beginning . 
  they were pretty much just a re-branded youth section of the communist party back in yugoslavia , but in slovenia in the 80 's this meant , that they were a wide array of liberals , neo-marxists , anarchists , pro-lgbt people and others . 
  with their re-branding into lds , the liberal faction won and they became centre-left party , that was known as the party that can cooperate with any other party ( they even cooperated with sds , before its president decided to start selling illegal weapons to bosnia and try to incite a military coup ) . 
  it 's not fixed , but it 's not really democratic either . 
  it 's obvious that the founding fathers did n't want a democracy , they wanted a republic , and that 's why they created a system where every branch of the government is elected differently . 
  house of representatives was to be elected by the people or by lower houses of state congresses , senate was to be elected by the representatives ( either both houses or state senates ) and president by electorates nominated by way that the state decided to do it , mostly nominated by both houses . 
  this was done this way to create a certain `` pyramid '' system where every layer would have it 's own constituents . 
  but this obviously changed when elections were democratised . 
  so now only remnant of the system proposed by the founding fathers is the electoral college , which has also seen some small changes , namely that electors ca n't be unpledged ( that is they are completely free to choose the president no matter what their voters want ) . 
  this at first seems very undemocratic to most europeans , but we forget that we do have various versions of electors ourselves . 
  first we do n't directly elect our prime ministers ( in the countries where we have parliamentary democracy ) , but rather elect representatives into parliament ( most of the time the lower house ) and then those representatives elect pm . 
  sure most of the times it 's obvious that the president of winning party will become the next pm ( having majority ) , but it 's not necessary . 
  this is also next and probably the biggest difference between our political systems and us system . 
  here president of political party is also the most influential within that party and they 're also the ones that are named into executive roles . 
  in the us presidents of dnc and rnc are pretty much almost anonymous , i do n't know either of them by name and i assume that most of europeans and americans are in the same boat with me . 
  i think that our parties lack the internal democracy of both us parties , as i said before there 's no question who will be named into executive or other important government roles . 
  us being as big as it is , and with the fact there are only two major parties has this speciality , that within those parties you have such a political and ideological diversity that in europe it most of the times fall on three or even more major parties . 
  point is , that party elections , that is primaries might feel strange both to use and even to americans , but they 're way more `` democratic '' and inclusive than our party elections , where most of the time party higher-ups meet up end decide to support the nomination of party president for pm or whatever if they win in elections . 
  so in a way i think they 're even less fixed than ours . 
  i just need to add this at the end : the actual problem within us elections are lobbyists and pacs and all the money that is thrown into the campaign of candidates . 
  while in any earlier election this might be the deciding fact in favour of elections being fixed ( the candidate with most money wins ) this primaries show that this is changing , but trump and sanders have shown us that this is n't as decisive on the election process as you might think ( or jeb !, 
  would have won republican nomination ) . 
  i 'm 29 . 
  while i technically lived in socialism , it really was n't socialism any more . 
  i just studied political science which also included loads of stuff on international politics , and that 's how i realised that a bipolar world is really not the way to go . 
  yes one of my fears was that the new `` cold war '' will be fought between us and china , which would be pretty bad in my opinion . 
  i once hoped that eu would somehow , through federalisation , become the superpower to oppose the us , but that 's not something that will happen any time soon . 
  first eu will never federalise , second eu should never federalise in the current form , and third the most obvious one : eu ca n't really be a `` opposite '' of us , when they share pretty much everything . 
  only difference is , that eu prefers using its soft power more often . 
  but with russia coming back from `` the dead '' it may become the superpower to oppose us again , and might again force china into a more regional role , as it had during sino-soviet split .

just out of curiosity ; what was inflation like in italy pre-euro ? 
   enough money for cigarettes and 2 beers , whereas today those same things would cost 8 - 9 $ . 
  that may have more to do with tax ( tro\u0161arine ) increases than anything else . 
  is that before or after complaining about inflation being too low ? 
  that 's the sort of thing people here are capable of . 
  maybe it 's different in italy . 
  the fact that this has less than a million views is an embarrassment . 
  why do n't you tell the class what 's really bothering you ?

  if you do n't like it , sucks to be you . 
  regarding the polish section : http://www.thenews.pl/1/12/artykul/167325,rail-baltica-to-link-poland-with-baltic-states  although poland already uses standard gauge , it would still need to upgrade its railway line from warsaw to trakiszki on the lithuanian border so that trains can travel at high speed . 
  according to butkevicius , prime minister donald tusk has ` promised ' to carry out the upgrade , and the entire rail baltica line is due to be completed by 2024 . 
  so even if this section of line ( warsaw to trakiszki ) were not modernised , it could still be used by the same trains , but at a lower speed . 
   yes , but those requirements are sexist and arbitrary how is it sexist to push in the direction of more equal distribution of responsibility ? 
  i 'd say that traditional gender roles are arbitrary ( given that physical labour is no longer the dominant form of employment ) and that this is the exact opposite of these arbitrary roles . 
  this is a completely new idea to me . 
  i might just not be aware of it , but to the best of my knowledge , no such thing exists . 
  if you come to a place where there are n't any asian people , you might get some stares from children , but that 's just what kids do when they see something new ( does n't just apply to asian people ) .

   i am against creating a specific policy to keep men at home for `` parity sake '' . 
  well , i 'm in favour of this . 
  if the state is paying for these benefits , it 's perfectly legitimate for it to attach some requirements to them as well . 
  it makes sense to have both parents involved in childcare . 
  besides , this is just an optional positive incentive , not a compulsion or a penalty . 
  presumably , not everybody has kids at the same time . 
  also , remember that not paying for this stuff means that there will be a shortage of kids to pay for your pension in a few decades ( among other problematic effects ) . 
  it 's definitely a [ manifestation of policy .

  1990 has been the benchmark since kyoto used it . 
  we 're on track to be at 80 % of 1990 by 2020 . 
  this means a transition to from 80 % to 60 % of 1990 within 10 years . 
  bottom line : i do n't know what you 're trying to say . 
  that 's just it : the growth in 2005 happened because of unsustainably borrowed money . 
  * those * were the unrealistic standards .

  for one thing , i tied my shoelaces just this morning and so did most people in the country . 
  before the euro , people here used the deutsch mark for comparing prices of any large purchase , investment ... savings accounts were also in marks . 
  but since everyone was paid in tolars ( scary inflation figures ) you would have to pay a commission every time you made a deposit or a purchase ( you still had to buy stuff in tolars ) . 
  now , you get paid in a strong currency and you process all prices in that same currency . 
  also , no commission any more . 
  more broadly , we 're an export driven economy and the euro [ helps with that . 
  ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/explore/stacked/hs/export/svn/show/all/1995.2012/ ) since the pound is a strong currency already , you 're essentially left with the trade benefits .

  it was a weird feeling at first to walk on the streets of the town i grew up in and feel like a tourist , but i came to accept it . 
  so yeah , it 's best to make your place of residence your spiritual home as well .

  is that estonia 's problem ? 
  you 're on the verge of depression , i actually slit my wrists . 
  i went to school in a completely different town than the hicksville my parents found work in , and mine and their hours were such that i often basically could n't see them for days . 
  i really do understand your situation , but it can be overcome . 
  look , i 'm familiar with your story . 
  but although me and my family ( sadly not all of them ) could easily fall into the trap of associating only with other croatians/serbians/bosnians / macedonians , we deliberately decided not to do so , in order to stop sticking out as soon as possible . 
  we did n't cut ties with other southerners , but we all immediately took lessons in slovenian , stopped watching croatian tv and reading croatian books until our slovenian did n't become acceptably good , and purposefully sought out slovenian acquaintancies and friends . 
  people laughed at our mistakes but also usually corrected them , and we made the best of our embarrassment . 
  yes , it 's difficult . 
  yes , we were sometimes insanely lonely . 
  yes , people sometimes insulted us and destroyed our property for being of the wrong nationality . 
  and yes , giving up and returning to croatia crossed our minds countless times . 
  but we endured and did what had to be done . 
  now i have slovenian citizenship , my accent almost disappeared ( only professional musicians recognize it ) and i feel as much at home in slovenia as in croatia , if not more . 
  it 's not about luck , it 's about hard work and sacrifices . 
  it 's up to the particular country to determine what 's a national minority and what is n't .

  home is where your address is . 
  there is a croatian proverb : ne pljuj u bunar iz kojega pije\u0161 ( do n't spit into the well you drink from ) . 
  i do n't know if it 's majority or not , but those who refuse to at least outwardly assimilate really grind my gears because they give * me * a bad name . 
  a brainwashed russian does something . 
  police checks if he 's citizen . 
  if he 's not , kick him across the border . 
  if he is , find an irregularity in his naturalization process , revoke his citizenship and kick him across the border . 
  problem solved . 
  1 ) well here the requirement is five years of uninterrupted residence . 
  but the requirement for getting a work permit for a stranger is knowledge of slovenian language , which in essence forces you to learn it . 
  ( and i , personally , would expel anyone who lives more than five years here and did n't master the language yet . 
  i 'm an immigrant , btw . ), 
  2 ) since when is a national minority exempted from having to learn the official language ? 
  or maybe they could just go the fuck back to russia if they do n't like estonians and wo n't learn the language and consume estonian media . 
   12 % of latvians have no citizenship at all  latvians, 
  the basic duty of a permanent resident is to speak the official language of his country .

  oh , they have a goal . 
  to take over the world , more or less . 
  they 're making non-muslim people hate muslims ( and especially immigrants ) , which in turn creates new generations of muslims that are angry at the rest of the world for being treated badly , and then these muslims join isis . 
  that 's how terrorism works .

  and if you honestly believe that big businesses in the us do n't hold incredible amounts of power over the government , you should read more . 
  they influence absolutely everything , and are almost never held responsible for anything , unlike the average person . 
  i literally explained it in my comment . 
  and there are only two sentences in it . . 
  it 's not about getting free media , it 's about big corporations and rich/powerful people always being treated better than anyone else . 
  that 's inequality . 
  there 's so much shit going on in the country , and yet they focus so much time , money and manpower on bringing down a torrent site that 's only having a tiny impact on a multi billion dollar industry . 
  it 's pathetic . 
  he does n't live in turkey . 
  it 's not a democracy because , big companies will always be put before the people and they 'll always be treated better . 
  democracy is supposed to be about equality for all . 
  `` i do what i want '' - erdogan , probably . 
  looks like they 're skipping afghanistan and going straight to syria . 
  that is still islamophobia , not racism . 
  islam is a religion , not a race . 
  they murdered innocent people , including children . 
  if you see nothing wrong with that , there 's something wrong with you . 
  it 's a sign of solidarity and compassion , do n't read too much into it . 
  the whole world ca n't actually get actively involved in turkey 's problems . 
  when a large-scale tragedy happens somewhere , it 's common courtesy for other countries to show their respect . 
  i think it 's actually around 20.000 , but still an incredibly low number compared to other euro countries . 
  well yeah , either way . 
  i just think it 's important to show up and vote , no matter what you put on that ballot . 
  i 'd rather see all the undecided people return empty ballots , than have everyone call half the population lazy for not going to vote . 
  yeah , but they 're still counted . 
  that 's most people 's idea of a `` protest vote '' . 
  probably less so with the remain vote , though . 
  if that side won , nothing would change , so people would just move on with their lives and forget about it in a few weeks . 
   you want to protests , go and protest , do n't use ballots to do so . 
  actually , you should use ballots to do so . 
  deface them or write whatever on them . 
  it means that you 're willing to vote , you just disagree with all the choices . 
  voting for the thing you do n't want , however , is the dumbest thing ever . 
  well , every cloud . . 
  they do n't need to . 
  this was n't a complaint , they just explained to the uk what their future might look like . 
  if you want a trade agreement , you 'll have to accept some eu regulations , and you wo n't have a say when these regulations will be getting formed anymore . 
  well yeah , all eu money comes from its members . 
  but the eu spends a lot of it on promoting culture and regional development . 
  it 's highly unlikely that the uk government will spend the same amount of money on these things once they 're on their own . 
  well , i hope they can support their families with principles when the money runs out . 
  k , we 'll see how it goes now that you 're really on your own . 
  i 'm sure your new leadership will gladly support the same projects the eu did . 
  it was the eu 's money . 
  you 're not the only country putting money into that piggy bank . 
  sure . 
  we 'll see who was right soon enoguh . 
  not when they start losing their jobs . 
  1 or 2 years , probably . 
  `` what ** they thought ** '' being the key part here . 
  the world 's economists seem to disagree . 
   the uk can cope fine without europe - it has done before . 
  the uk will soon lose the `` u '' , because scotland is definitely leaving as soon as possible . 
  maybe ni as well . 
  so whatever happens , it wo n't stay the same . 
  which is why democracy sometimes just fails . 
  some decisions are too complex for the average voter to understand , and basing your decision on who yells the loudest on tv probably is n't the right way to go . 
  which is one of the stupidest things i 've ever seen , because wales gets a ton of money from the eu . 
  i like how people are blaming cameron for this result . 
  he 's a twat , but he only did what the people wanted , which is how democratic countries are supposed to work . 
  blame the 17.000.000 twats that voted to leave instead . 
  more like `` you decided to sink this ship , you deal with it . '', 
  i 'm definitely not a cameron supporter , but who can blame him for leaving ? 
  people obviously do n't share his views , so there 's no reason for him to keep representing the people , which is what his job is supposed to be . 
  i 'll make sure to visit soon !,

  that 's awesome , thanks !, 
  he did n't quote you btw , but we can all read between the lines . 
  oh , it does , but most people have correctly surmised that it is abhorrent and are happy to ignore it . 
  the god of the old testament did n't fuck around . 
  is it convincing when you hold it in your hands as well ? 
  or is the texture different ? 
  it looks pretty good in a picture ( even has a watermark and the holographic thingy ) , i can imagine it fooling someone who 's not paying attention . 
  personally , i do n't think turkey is any significant threat to german dominance in the eu , even if they did join . 
  they are a minor regional power who happens to be on the crossroads of east and west . 
  their reach is severely overestimated at the moment because of tensions in the region , but after that settles , they 're back to making hookas and carpets . 
   no matter what the case is , it wont happen  the only way merkel would ever let turkey join uhhh ... 
  probably , i never thought she did , it 's just the previous post that makes it sound like that . 
  that balance of power is subject to change as well , and i believe she could change her mind re . 
  turkey if she thought it was in the best interest of germany . 
  nothing is set in stone , least of all politics . 
  and you , i am assuming , are an american with very skewed views of what left and right politics are like outside of the us . 
  just because she 's right leaning does n't mean she 's a raging xenophobe . 
  no thanks . 
  but i will get my kids vaccinated to protect you and yours , even though you clearly do n't deserve it . 
  you took it upon yourself to decide whether something is a public health risk and came to the wrong conclusion which is now endangering others . 
  but are fine with putting other 's lives in danger as long as the `` medical inspector '' is you . 
  ah , i did n't know about that . 
  not really . 
  most of those buildings are shells only , they look great on the outside , but on the inside it 's literally medieval . 
  i 've witnessed stray cats giving birth in one of their ministries . 
  ( which looks great on the outside too ) the front entrance ( for visitors ) is all marble and has 3 mercedes s-classes parked in front of it all the time . 
  the back entrance ( for employees ) is a hole in the wall with a dirt path leading to it . 
  both entrances lead into the same hallway . 
  not even kidding . 
  azerbaijan 's building boom is a kind of social program : the goal is n't to make a ton of buildings , it 's to provide a ton of jobs . 
  azerbaijan has no social programs to speak of otherwise . 
  i never said what you quoted . 
  greek reluctance to reform is public knowledge . 
  there are weekly reports on greek debt in pretty much every newspaper with a financial section . 
  ( tl ; dr : greece is counting on it 's debt being erased at some point , that 's why the reforms are surface deep and completely ineffective . 
  there is no plan b and reforms are only going to be more painful as time goes on , so unless the debt gets erased greece is f 'd . 
  lenders are the only ones gaining from the situation as it is . ), 
  i agree with this assessment , not least because it 's * the * balkan way to go . 
  half assed & `` she 'll be alright '' all the way . 
  it comes from the fact that your tax and pension systems still have n't been structurally reformed after 9 years . 
  you could do that , but that would be dodging the question . 
  i would n't recommend that , given your existing reputation for dodging ( taxes ) . 
   based on the above source ? 
  no , but at least that would be an attempt at `` something '' . 
  so far we 've seen mostly `` nothing '' . 
  you have enough control to reform your tax and pension systems , why do n't you start there ? 
  you need to condense this down and ramble less . 
  i ca n't spare the time to go through that . 
  edit : you seem aware of a number of blunders that happened during the invasion , then understand that it was not hard to predict that they would happen . 
  there was no reason an outside observer would think that a military intervention could result in positive changes , the history of that part of the world speaks for itself . 
  do you actually believe that bombing their infrastructure for a decade and causing the deaths of about half a million people has nothing to do with why they are leaving in droves ? 
  i ask you , why are n't mongolians immigrating in droves into europe , if it 's truly our generosity that attracts immigration ? 
  no , it 's afghans , syrians and iraqis . 
  and what do those three have in common ? 
  hmm . 
  do you just chalk it up to coincidence ? 
   get those hands nice and clean how nice of you to take them at their word . 
  no way that could backfire . 
  where was this good will when they were swearing ( truthfully ) up and down that they had no wmds ? 
  i 'm sure all those refugees think that was incredibly generous of you . 
  not to mention effective . 
  did i imply the contrary ? 
  brits were first in line to join and contributed the most to the destabilization . 
  now they 're the first to wash their hands of the matter while complaining the loudest . 
  brits foresaw nothing . 
  they rushed headlong to join the us in destabilizing the middle east , even though people were warning that there was no plan beyond `` fuck shit up '' and that europe , ultimately , would have to deal with the fallout . 
  i 'll take that as a `` yes '' . 
  how one gets from `` quid-pro-quo '' to leech is beyond me though . 
  so i guess i need to ask you , why do you think the uk kept paying all this time ? 
  that 's not down to eu bureaucracy though , it 's the reality of living on a post-industrial island nation . 
  it 's not likely to change . 
  do you think the uk was just being super generous all this time ? 
  in currency perhaps , but not in any other measure . 
  it carefully avoided most of the 2008 recovery efforts for example and refused to participate in any eu project that did n't directly benefit it . 
  it was always a quid-pro-quo arrangement with the uk , the continent gave up plenty to accommodate it . 
  i 'm just trying to give you a different perspective . 
  what the eu wanted was a team player not a donor , because your participation has more value than your bank account . 
  because your contributions always came with strings attached , usually to the detriment of the continent . 
  while that could be tolerated within a union , it ca n't be outside one . 
  the view from the continent is that you 've been getting a steady diet of carrots for the last couple of decades . 
  clearly that did n't work . 
  if you think of the situation as a married couple separating : do you think it makes sense to keep buying diamond rings for your wife after she handed you divorce papers and lawyered up ? 
  they were nationalist when they were in power too . 
  obviously that is n't what defines them as anti-establishment . 
  how so ? 
  they 've been around for 60 + years , have a ~ 20 % representation in austrian governmental positions and even held power for ~ 5 years ( 2000-05 ) . 
  can you define what `` establishment '' means to you , please ? 
  internalize , repeat and remember . 
  i thought you were responding to another post of mine , sorry . 
  it did seem out of place . 
  i 'm curious though , what do you think this is about ? 
  clearly we are all aware how it ended , what is crucial is what happened before that . 
  i want them to admit they did it , as perpetrators . 
  ~ ~ now imagine for a moment if the british had an annual celebration of the day they stopped burying enemy soldiers in the sand . 
  that 's what 's happening right now . ~ ~, 
  please demonstrate how ignorance ( an emergent property of intangible minds ) can be tangible . 
  i think what you really meant was `` stupid people '' not `` ignorance '' . 
  see : compartmentalization . 
  or do you actually believe * only * the ignorant went along with/joined the fascists ? 
  this is the official position of the italian state and the prevalent opinion of italian posters in this thread .

  yes , but you guys are rather new to the currency . 
  i used to convert all the time as well , but the prices have changed so much since the switch , that it has no meaning anymore to say that something would cost 500 sit , because in 2006 the same article was was probably more like 200 sit anyway . 
  on a slightly irrelevant note ; the name janez , while very stereotypically slovene , has been decreasing in popularity over the last 50 or so years to the point , where , today , i only know 2 people named janez under the age of 30 and everyone calls them johny , anyway . 
  the long nights take a toll on people . 
  hell , i get annoyed , when i get home at 4 in december and it 's dark outside and slovenia is quite a bit to the south compared to , say , bergen . 
  one of the other candidates is the former slovene president danilo t\u00fcrk . 
  it 's not about the relevancy of the country when it comes to posts in the un .

  how many huge bodybuilders do you see per week on average ? 
  and by huge i mean arnold-in-his-prime size , his bmi was slightly under 32 then . 
  i doubt it . 
  people who are considered obese by bmi , but are actually not , are well aware of how bmi works . 
  it takes amateur bodybuilders several years to even get to a bmi of 25 with a low bodyfat % . 
  being active and doing all sorts of physical activites is a very big part of slovene culture . 
  so is eating massive amounts of meat and potatoes though and drinking wine/beer ... too bad exercise is not that effective at burning calories . 
  then again a huge amont of young people are very health-conscious , so i 'm actually fairly optimistic about obesity rates over the next 20 years . 
  just fyi , the last one ( slovenia 2009 ) is actually slovakian . 
  while `` slovensko '' does mean the land of slovenes in slovene it is never used in this context . 
  the slovene coins always say slovenija . 
  and sloboda is the slovak word for freedom as opposed to the slovene svoboda . 
  honestly people say that german is hard , but here it 's seen as the easy language , because most of its grammar follows well defined rules with very few exceptions ... 
  the only annoying thing is having to memorize genders ... 
  it 's one of their arguments , actually . 
  that the uk complains , but then follow the rules of the eu , whereas the other bash the uk for complaining , but then ignore the rules themselves anyway ... 
  they mixed up slovakia for slovenia . 
  the second slovenia should say slovakia . 
  maybe slavs were considered white , but not aryan on the level of germanic people . 
  slavs were to be used as cheap labour in the post-war nazi-led europe . 
  when yugoslavia capitulated in 1941 hitler visited maribor , the second largest city in slovenia , and said : `` machen sie mir dieses land wieder deutsch . '', 
  ( make this land german again ) . 
  this was followed by a massive wave of forced relocations of slovenes to serbia and other places as well as other measures of removing the slovene population . 
  2 million . 
  today roughly 15 % are ex-yugoslav immigrants . 
  what ? 
  the combined european part of nato dwarfs russia in military expenditure . 
  you just linked a google search with some results of some amateurishly made maps which mean nothing . 
  there 's a [ map ] ( http://www.mapsnworld.com/political-world-map/eastern-europe.jpg ) of `` eastern europe '' there which depicts belgium and the netherlands . 
  not to mention , that the geographical centre of europe is in belarus . 
  because germans do n't like nuclear energy and it takes a lot of coal to power such a large economy . 
  brussels is officially bilingual , it 's also the capital of the dutch speaking region , but most people who live there speak french .

  brno in the czech republic is another great pick .

  this map predicts our population density to increase by at least 2,5 times ( which is absurd ) while all other projections predict our population to stay roughly the same . 
  i suppose most of these dishes are typical for the area relatively close to zagreb and to the north-east ? 
  becuase practically all of the listed dishes are typical for slovenian cuisine around \u0160tajerska and prekmurje ( i.e. 
  the thinnest strip of slovenia between austria and croatia closest to hungary ) .

  probably not , since the rocks given to yugoslavia are , afaik , kept in serbia . 
  oh boy , so as to avoid confusion between slovenia and slovakia it 's easiest to simply not include us .

  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbzcecvoata ), 
  honestly , people here were rather shocked . 
  these were the people we 've lived with for almost 80 years . 
  everyone knew at least someone from each of the republics , practically everyone , who was an adult then , knows someone who has died in the wars . 
  my father often speaks of the people he 's met while serving his mandatory service and wonders aloud , how many of them have died in the war and where the rest are today . 
  of course it was blatanly obivous that there were nationalistic tensions , but people could not believe what was going on , and had had a hard time processing that tragedies like srebrenica could happen so close to home . 
  nowadays we avoid the subject and spend our time debating whose grandfather was on which side during the nazi occupation and whose father was a spy for the communist government ... 
  ah , i guess i should 've thought of that ... 
  should 've been bijela ruka , though , should n't it ... also / u/crnaruka is serbian . 
  serbs spell bijela as [ bela ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_hand_%28military_organization%29 ) , so maybe a croatian equal-opposite . 
  hey , whatever floats your boat . 
  the balkans do n't have a uniform culture , now , do they ? 
  would you consider serbian culture very similar to romanian or greek ? 
  just because our languages are similar does n't mean our cultures are . 
  besides , what i said is true . 
  there are immigrants here , who refuse to assimilate , people who have lived here for over 50 years and still ca n't speak the language . 
  and milan ku\u010dan . 
  obviously , my point was , that our cultures are not similar enough to not require assimilation when a person of one nationality moves to the area of the other nationality . 
  [ quite . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/srbija_do_tokija#/media/file:graffiti_ljubljana_64.jpg ), 
  because the french gave more rights to the slovene language in the illyrian province as opposed to the habsburgs , slovenes generally thought of the new regime as an improvement . 
  in fact , there 's still a french revolution square in ljubljana ( the capital of illyrian province ) and afaik the only [ statue/memorial of napoleon ] ( http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3034/3015614242_ab5fdc4123.jpg ) outside france . 
  this is what i was taught as well . 
  that the royal white is surrounded by the colours of paris to show the control of the people over the king . 
  oh , they were notorious for their protruding jaw/chin . 
  if you look at paintings of habsburgs you will notice , that they 're not particularly good looking . 
  well , this is what they looked like after being `` beautified '' by the artist .

  well if you live alone with only your benefits that would be very very difficult . 
  but there are some sneaky people who make it work . 
  unemployed people get around 295 $ here . 
  if you volounteer you get some extra , depending on how much you work , maybe 100 $ extra . 
  not sure . 
  if you have kids you get more . 
  i think 222 $ for the eldest child and 193 $ for every next child . 
  you can also get subsidised rent and emergency social benefits ( for paying old bills , buying new basic apliencees ... ) . 
  you can get this per month or per year . 
  you can get maximum ~ 1500 $ per year for a single person and max ~ 4400 $ for a family . 
  there are some rules for receiving emergency benefits such as needing to spend them in 45 days and you also need to show receipts . 
  you can also ask red cross or karitas to help you with bills . 
  i had a coworker who worked for a minimum wage that said , she 'll never work for a minimum wage again because she can live just about the same with all the benefits . 
  this is just theory , i do n't know how it really works . 
  i was confused coz , how could anyone know his mistress ? 
  is that a french thing to not be secretive about it ?

  she 's like 25 years older . 
  i can see plenty of other books on that list . 
  when i was in school our letters looked like american ones . 
  but we were never given practice sheets like that . 
  the teacher just wrote a letter on a black/whiteboard and sometimes in your notebook . 
  in later grades , 4th and on i think , we were taught cursive . 
  and we were encouraged to write cursive from then on . 
  at first we had to write with pencils and later with fountain pens .

  ( football ) the one i remember the most was slovenia : yugoslavia on euro 2000 . 
  we were leading 3:0 until 67th minute . 
  then 6 minutes later it was 3:2 and another 7 minuntes later it was 3:3 . 
  and yugoslavia had a player less . 
  though in my memorry we were leading till the last 6 minutes lol . 
  i 'm not even sure what usual temperatures are anymore . 
  they fluctuate too much . 
  it was around 16 - 20 \u00b0 c here today . 
  i guess that 's normal . 
  i have heard from commentators while watching skiing world cup that the snow in the us is diffenet . 
  that 's all i know . 
  i have only skied in the alps . 
  i 've been to the sahara desert in tunisia and egypt . 
  it was hot as i immagined but also dry so not that difficult to survive . 
  comming out of an air conditioned hotel in douz was a bit of a shock though . 
  parades are for acceptance by society , not only legal acceptance . 
  besides , they 're fun . 
  why ban something fun ? 
  when lgbt + become widely accepted , parades will go away on its own . 
  equal in every way . 
  [ yes ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ofihgwa.jpg ) this does n't show even smaller subgroups though . 
  a saying here is `` vsaka vas ima svoj glas '' , meaning : every village has it 's own voice/dialect . 
  that 's what i found . 
  i ca n't find any actual numbers , but they 're protected . 
  i think this year they start june ~ ~ 19th ~ ~ 26th and end on september ~ ~ 4th ~ ~ 1st . 
  it 's always ~ ~ mid june ~ ~ 2nd half of june - around 1st september ( depending on what day 1st september falls ) . 
  edit : other school holidays are : * autumn holidays : 1 week - end of october/beginning of november * new year holidays : ~ 1 week - christmas day - january 2nd ( 2.1 is still school free day ) * winter holidays : 1 week - 2nd half of february * may 1st holidays : 27th april - may 2nd ( may 2nd is still work/school free day ), 
  i met some french girls who were blown away that people make cookies at home and have chickens in their backyard .

  yes . 
  the lack of definition is exactly the problem . 
  i am aware essential services should take priority , but we need to have a clear definition for what counts as `` essential '' first . 
  i would n't trust `` the markets '' any further than i could throw them . 
  convenient , ainnit ? 
  mine too . 
  and historically , when european nations got nationalistic and started to push each other around , bad stuff happened . 
  ca n't we get a fiscal union first ? 
  first secure the foundations of a common european budget before trying to fund a common european army ? 
  this is the day when i learned that `` buttress '' was a word . 
  pfsh . 
  it is you who has no idea how this works !, 
  i mean , you think journalism is about * stating facts * ? 
  you are a fool !, 
  it 's all about half-truths , insinuations , and click-bait . 
  on a more serious note , yeah , i looked into it myself , and it is as you say . 
  and yes , it would be kinda appropriate for the media to check their facts before spewing bullshit . 
  as i always say , bullshit * can * be good fertilizer , but too much of it is just gon na smother anything useful that might grow otherwise . 
  you 're way off the mark on that one . 
  have n't been a kid since ... forever , it feels now . 
  but i guess i need to explicitly state when i 'm being sarcastic , huh . 
  i think ( and i 'd say i think most countries would say the same ) the attitude around here is `` pretending they do n't exist '' . 
  which is pretty ... well , dehumanizing . 
  i. . . do n't know . 
  at least in slovenia ( though , okay , not even warsaw pact , much less soviet , but definitely ex-socialist ) , mostly of it was spun like `` hey , we can get into the cool kids ' treehouse now '' . 
  we had the eu and nato referendums on the same day . 
  eu was 90 % in favor , nato only about 65 % . 
  i 'd have preferred it myself to stay neutral like our northern neighbors . 
  though i do generally agree that especially the baltic states , and poland likely did join nato in a large part to be safe from russia . 
  generally do n't go into large crowds and listen to everyone if you value it . 
  internet gives everyone a platform but i sometimes really ca n't handle * so many people talking at once * . 
  i do n't know . 
  i 'd prefer dying on my own terms rather than someone else 's . 
  i 'd almost be inclined to take that deal , since it would sorta turn the shape of slovenia from `` chicken '' to `` chicken flapping its wings '' and that 'd be kind of awesome . 
  since when is austria part of bavaria ? 
  i mean lederhosen and all . 
  also , that sounds a bit overly dramatic , if hypo blows up the european banking system i 'll be rather impressed . 
  but hey , if carinthia gets `` cut off '' maybe we can annex it and punish it for voting the other way back in 1920 . 
  ( i 'm kidding on this one ), 
  good post . 
  i like it . 
  shit like this * will * happen again , it 's just inevitable . 
  our monetary system pretty much depends on debt and credit to function . 
  i mean , if people ( and countries ) stopped taking loans , things would get pretty ugly . 
  sometimes anomalies like this will appear ; sometimes on a personal , sometimes on a national level . 
  europe 's dealing with a lot of shit right now as it is . 
  and i wonder what 's the price of not having golden dawn to win on next greek elections . 
  you agree it 's sad to see it ? 
  yeah , see , that 's what i mean . 
  i only use this argument on people who are all `` fuck 'em , they had it coming '' and all . 
  because the `` they '' that had it coming have actually shifted their bill onto the next generation . 
  i do n't actually have a solution for it ( if i had one , i 'd be the next nobel peace laureate , since as you said , there are other countries dealing with that or worse , and i 'd save them all !, 
  ) , i 'm just suggesting it might not be as simplistic as pictured . 
  well , that 's pretty much obvious . 
  a strong eu is a threat for russian interests , and vice versa , it seems . 
  we should do more tectonics research , maybe we can create a new fault and finally divorce ourselves from russia . 
  or get them divorced from us , what with relativity of movement , and all . 
  as long as we 're next to each other we 'll have to deal with this kind of crap every now and then . 
  not really . 
  the ones paying the price are not the ones who racked up the bill . 
  it 's easy to go the `` moral '' route , but you 're forgetting that the people who are paying the price likely were n't even able to vote 15 years go . 
  oh for cryin out loud ... 
  well , this is a classic case of what 's better for us is worse for them , and vice versa ; that 's why we 're in conflict in the first place . 
  i 'm just saying that we have no reason ( or for that matter , * right * ) to expect that another country will submit to our terms just because we want it to . 
  just like putin has no reason or right to expect that we 'll submit to * his * terms just because that 's what he wants . 
  oh , he is a very pragmatic man , yes , and not stupid at all . 
  that 's why i cringe a little every time someone describes him as an idiot blinded by ideology and ussr nostalgia . 
  he 's a lot of bad things , but that is n't one of them . 
  well , i 'm not denying that , but at least he does n't seem to think `` restoring ussr by force * right nao * '' is something he should do , as opposed to zyuganov who thinks exactly that . 
  exactly , that 's what i mean . 
  a country in economic ruin is n't exactly the environment to attract the democratic and liberal type when it comes to power shifts . 
  * especially * not if that country 's political structure is basically built around more or less one person . 
  if that person goes , you have a power vacuum , and * that will get ugly * . 
  to put it differently , imagine yugoslavia had completed its nuclear weapons program ( it was halted because it was simply too expensive ) . 
  now , imagine serbia and croatia would have had a couple nukes each in the 90s . 
  even with conventional weaponry , it was a * massacre * . 
  and bosnia and kosovo are * still * completely ruined . 
  and russia will just roll over and take the punch without trying to fight back , just because we really , really want it to , right ? 
  the `` hey , have we mentioned the stressed russian economy today yet ? '', 
  line of news is getting really old . 
  18 months does sound reasonable . 
  but do we have a strategy for then ? 
  the thing is , * what * kind of shit will hit the fan ? 
  call me pessimistic , but i doubt `` a truly democratic election '' is going to get anywhere near close to kremlin in that environment . 
  are we betting on another guy we can get drunk so he 'll sign whatever we want ? 
  the long-term strategy of this entire affair is just lost on me , i do n't even get if there is one . 
  i mean , there 's a lot of political pressure put on putin himself , since he 's basically consolidated pretty much all the power in russia in his office . 
  so currently our strategy is pretty much `` unless he does what we want him to , putin has to go . '', 
  but even assuming that `` shit hitting the fan '' sweeps him out of that office of his ( which , again , call me pessimistic , i would n't actually bet on ) , what then ? 
  how do we keep vultures like zyuganov out of it ? 
  basically , what i 'm saying ... i 'd like to see more long-term news and predictions rather being told , day after day , the stuff i already know since the first time it 's been said . . 
  russia does n't exactly place the same value on a soldier 's life as we do . 
  `` we 've got reserves '' and `` if all else fails , scorch the earth and retreat , then laugh at the enemy conquering a burned-down wasteland '' has been their military doctrine since ... well , ever . 
  but , this does put russia into an interesting position . 
  they ca n't really comment on deaths of the soldiers that `` officially '' are n't actually there . 
  i wonder how that 's going to go down . 
  well , unrelated to the issue at hand , but going `` fuck this , i 've got places to be and things to do '' is not `` backing off '' , it 's `` not wasting your time '' . 
  tho in this case , the matter needs to be handled . 
  problem is we simply ca n't `` divorce '' russia and europe so we 'll be dealing with this kind of shenanigans until the time of sovereign nation-states is over . 
  in diplo-language , `` if necessary '' basically means `` we 're going to do this sometime soon , we just need to compare notes first '' .

  any i especially do n't know anyone who 's eager to cook something like that in that kind of heat without air con . 
  yes , sometimes it 's necessary but most of the times people just eat something lighter . 
  like a tomato , bell pepper , cucumber and onion salad with lots of vinegar and pumpkin seed oil to dip your bread in . 
  na\u0161e vasi so najlep\u0161e . 
  i may be a bit biased , but yes to ljubljana . 
  and i 'd do kor\u010dula instead of hvar . 
  typical is that there is no typical . 
  there are new houses , old houses , pretty houses , terrible houses , white houses , bright red houses . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/@46.3174625,15.4799687,3a,75y,211.39h,77.07t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sepngzxdyv4pyrz89m8hvtq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) is a random small village in the eastern part of the country . 
  wikipedia says population is 594 . 
  this kind of small villages are very common here . 
  even smaller ones , more like settlements rather than villages where 2 cars can barely meet and there 's a few houndred meters between the houses . 
  safe driving test is awesome , i 'm thinking of doing it again . 
  also , young drivers need a `` young driver insurance '' which is quite a bit more expensive than the regular one . 
  1st aid class and exam = ** 85 $ ** health check up = ** 40 $ ** road and traffic regulations class and exam = ** 60 $ ** then you need a minimmum of 20h with a driving instructor in a driving school . 
  20 hours is usually for those who had a driving licence but was taken for them . 
  1st time driver in ljubljana needs 40 hours on average . 
  1 driving hour with an instructor is around ** 24 $ ** , cheaper if you take it in a package of 10 , 20 , 30 etc hours . 
  30 hours in a driving school i went to , was 660 $ . 
  i have heard of people needing 200 hours and more . 
  then , when your instructor thinks you 're ready , he or she will apply you for a driving exam with an official examiner . 
  that costs an additional ** 15 ** $ . 
  if you do n't pass , you 'll need additional hours with your instructor and additional exams so the cost will go up . 
  so if you 're an average driving student in ljubljana and you need 40 driving hours , the whole thing will cost you around ** 1100 $ ** . 
  edit : this is a cost if you pass everything on 1st try , which is kind of rare . 
  edi2 : after 2 years of having a drivers licence you need to do a `` young driver - safe * driving '' theoretical and practical class but there 's no exam . 
  this class is done at a driving park and teaches you how to react in dangerous situations such as slippery road , sudden obsticle on a road etc. . . 
  this costs ** 125 $ ** . 
  as everything else , this is an obligatory test or you wo n't get your licence extended . 
  it 's mostly popular with teens . 
  scooters are one of the reasons kids still get confirmation done here . 
  because scooter is a popular gift . 
  they usually use them to get to the train or bus station to go to school . 
  i rarely see adults using them . 
  there was plenty of talk about it a few months ago . 
  my impression is that majority ( edit : maybe `` most '' is a more suitable word ) want it legalized . 
  there was talk about legalizing it but it 's such a dificult topic and so much to be done around it , it will take a while . 
  things have been quiet lately though . 
  i thought so : /, 
  you 're so sad . 
  the question is `` what sort of criminals are considered `` the worst '' in your country ? '', 
  not `` what sort of crimes are discused mostly '' . 
  i am positive other countries do n't constantly talk about pedophilia , do they ? 
  and you 're just blabbing in the wrong direction . 
  if you go and ask random people what sort of crime they think is the worst , i am pretty damn sure most will say pedophilia and very little to none will even think of bringing up `` tycoons '' . 
  i have never witnessed or heard about racims against black people . 
  no one gives a shit about black people . 
  there 's not many of them here anyway and those who are are well integrated . 
   yes , slovenia . 
  the locally dubbed `` tycoons '' realistically take the cake for `` most hated criminals '' , at least judging by the people 's electoral choices and constant bitching . 
  that 's because that 's all that is in the news all the time . 
  why would we bitch about things that are n't constantly in the news ? 
   i do n't remember many people giving e.g. 
  catholic church priest pedophilia scandals a second thought publicly . 
  yea , there 's a proof you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  everyone shits over catholic church for pedophilia scandals . 
  it 's one of the biggest arguments againts them . 
  if not the biggest . 
  thank you !, 
  very well explained !, 
  i have actually stumbled upon a pedophilia subthread on some psyche forum once . 
  it was kind of sad to read their posts . 
  most of them were considering suicide to prevent themselves from doing harm to others . 
  erm , do you expect any european country to not put pedophiles on the top spot ? 
  what ? 
  in slovenia , firefighters are very well respected . 
  we have professional and volounteer firefighters . 
  pretty much every village has volounteer firefighters and a lot of the kids are members . 
  joining firefighters is like joining scouts . 
  they have weekly excercises . 
  of course , kids do n't participate in case of emergencies but they are just being trained through play . 
  people are never reluctant to donate money to volounteer firefighters . 
  police on the other hand are not so well respected . 
  they are seen as those who just wait in the bushes for people who speed . 
  i do n't know whether this is a general opinion , or just an opinion of those loud idiots who always comment on the news portals . 
  i certainly do n't share this opinion . 
  well it does get up to 36/37 , about once a year even more . 
  26 is quite chilly . 
  in winter , we usually keep an inside temperature at around 24 . 
  so 25/26 in summer is appropriate in my apartment * . 
  putting it on 17 and then going outside in scorching heat is dangerous . 
  air conditioning is not very common but not out of ordinary in slovenia . 
  they are getting way more popular now because summers are getting way hotter . 
  we have it at home and turn it on when it 's 30 + outside . 
  and we never set it lower than 26 or 25 . 
  that 's plenty cold in the summer . 
  it 's advised that the difference between outside temp . 
  and inside temp . 
  should n't be more than 4 \u00b0 c. 
  so what stance does the uk have on ttip ? 
  is it true they want to block a democratic vote or is that just a rumor i heard ? 
  my question is , if they do decide to leave , before they go , can they still vote on things like ttip even though they 'll be leaving and it wo n't concern them ? 
  pony is comming back !, 
  it 's definitely not a lot . 
  you can get by for less if you need to save , but that would mean your diet would n't be very good and varied . 
  it 's easier to get by in the summer if you have a garden though . 
  food prices in germany and slovenia are about the same . 
  bankomat, 
  in slovenia a single person gets around 300 $ . 
  that 's enough if you live with someone who pays the bills but not otherwise .

  holy shit those are both horrific . 
  i ca n't decide which one i love more . 
  the fact that he did it is great . 
  how fast he did it was amazing .

  did they bring the brooms ? 
  german army * sweeps * through poland !, 
  the main point of that lander is to test out landing tech . 
  they just thought it would be a nice side project to also look into the defining feature of martian weather while they were already there . 
  also , if you 'd read the article you would know that most esa missions are n't exploration endeavours at all , they 're service focused - essentially space based infrastructure . 
  the european space agency ( esa ) expects that its schiaparelli module will land on mars on oct. 19 for a brief mission to study what causes dust storms on the planet . 
  in an email interview , thomas hoerber , a professor at the essca school of management , discusses the esa 's mission and its relationship to the european union . 
  wpr : what are the european space agency 's space capabilities and who are its major international partners , in terms of space diplomacy and commercial ties ? 
  thomas hoerber : the esa is a technical agency that brings together the best space engineering expertise europe has to offer . 
  this ethos is important for the implementation of major space endeavors , such as the galileo satellite navigation system , the copernicus earth observation program and , most recently , the rosetta mission to land on a comet . 
  this expertise is also the reason why major european space actors such as france , germany , italy , belgium and britain see the esa as the best platform for their space programs . 
  for example , france first proposed the ariane launch vehicle , but could not have afforded to develop it alone . 
  the esa 's expertise is also the reason why it is a key partner of nasa and the russian space agency , whose soyuz launch system is frequently used by the esa . 
  the founding director of the esa , roy gibson , said on the 40th anniversary of the agency in 2014 : `` we were helping to construct europe . '' the esa has built up european space companies , such as arianespace , while companies with national roots often in the military sector , like thales or ohb , have become european multinational aerospace firms . 
  wpr : what have the major priorities of the esa been historically , and how are those changing ? 
  hoerber : the esa 's space engineering expertise is uncontested . 
  space engineering is why the organization was created , and it remains its purpose today . 
  under its previous director general , jean-jacques dordain , the esa was considered the implementing agency of the european union 's space policy , despite the unease about the political consequences of europe 's growing space capabilities . 
  the esa was created in 1975 deliberately as a nonpolitical organization . 
  at that time , the european integration process was not held in high esteem , and therefore the esa was created as an intergovernmental institution that allowed member states to stop any activity they wanted , with the exception of a few core functions . 
  the discussion about the relationship between the esa and the eu -- the latter being a political organization with democratic legitimacy -- highlights the pressing question of whether or not growing space capabilities necessitate increased political leadership , sanctioning and accountability . 
  it also shows the current doubts about whether the esa , under its current charter , can fulfill that political role . 
  this is why the esa has become interested in closer cooperation with the eu on space activities , especially since the eu has proven it does n't have the technical expertise to implement space programs , as shown by its clumsy management of the galileo program . 
  wpr : how big of a political priority is the esa and space policy to the eu , and to what extent is there overlap with other eu policies ? 
  hoerber : space capabilities have become an important tool for many other eu policies . 
  earth-observation capabilities are essential for eu climate change policies , and galileo will be europe 's independent geopositioning system , which is important for motorists , precision farming and shipping . 
  satellite intelligence is vital for border control , monitoring the migration crisis , crisis management and defense . 
  that is why galileo has received eu funding under the trans-european networks budget line , which finances major european infrastructure projects . 
  for the moment , it seems that the eu is content with space technologies serving other policies with more immediate benefits . 
  we are not in an era where even the starship enterprise could lead europeans to aspire to space exploration . 
  current eu policies are much more utilitarian , which is what the member states ask of the eu . 
  we are also no longer in the cold war , where the space race pushed the superpowers to spend more and more on prestige space projects . 
  in the eu , in contrast to other major powers , there is no member state that can afford such a large space program by itself . 
  therefore , the european option is the only one available for countries such as france , germany and the u.k. , which would remain a member of the esa even after brexit . 
  the question is , beyond these immediate benefits , is there a space policy that could contribute to the fostering of a european identity ? 
  i get that the open invitation to the third world was a maaasssive fuck up , but ... was n't it also kind of the only fuck up of hers during a exceptionally challenging period ? 
  also , while most people do n't care about this , the fact that it was a well intention-ed , principle based fuck up does mean something to me . 
  i just think she 's a competent leader with her heart in the right place , but nobody 's ever perfect . 
  pay denbts !,

  the question is why we see that as less serious . 
  if anything , organised crime is a far more widespread problem . 
  we should call it freude prime . 
  tired to find it . 
  could n't . 
  you 'd think there 'd be all sorts of info about this or a stream or something - but i ca n't find squat . 
  right on my sligger !, 
  it must meet the accession conditions like everyone else . 
  having said that , we should make sure they have adequate defences to protect against `` tourists '' from andromeda . 
  hey , we 're european redditors . 
  we 're in cafes half the time . 
  get your facts straight . 
  a necessary evil for the time being . 
  he he a reverse turkey, 
  i 'm not really clear on what face recognition would do to help here , but my point was more about opposition to mass surveillance than about favouring individual surveilence in this one specific case . 
  tgis sort of mass tracking was never on the table before . 
  citing existing laws as a legitimation is n't valid in my opinion . 
  this is a new development and its acceptability should be subject to public debate on its own merits . 
  just because you ban something does n't mean it goes away . 
  this holds true for drugs like opium as well as for the opium of the masses . 
  it may be part of the solution , but it ca n't stand on its own . 
  not successfully . 
  place one person under surveillance instead of millions ? 
  confirmed for muslim . 
  get out . 
  get out now . 
  go home !, 
  by that `` logic '' , the best way to minimise terrorism is to b afraid of air own shadow . 
  the amount of terror is n't determined by when their goal is achieved , but by what their capabilities are and how effective we are at intercepting their attempts . 
   the risk of dying in a terrorist attack has an additive effect it has an infinitesimal additive effect which is precisely the amount of concern it actually justifies . 
  no more . 
  also , you can cancel it out and even overshoot by , say , eating more vegetables , cutting down on sugar , taking the train instead of a car , etc. 
   what is the reward for risking terrorist attacks ? 
  i 'm not saying that there is . 
  what i 'm saying is that giving this statistically insignificant threat a disproportionate amount of attention , and worse , allowing ourselves to get emotional about it , does more aggregate damage than the original actions themselves . 
  my point is that there 's a comparative reward in moving the general public to embrace an apathetic attitude toward terrorism for the reasons you outline in your third point . 
  still more worried about getting into a car accident . 
  and i do n't worry about that all that often either to be honest . 
  still , if this marks a minimum for the given period , it 's good news . 
  how does russian peacekeeping work ? 
  russia keeps a piece of this , a piece of that ... 
  tell it to satan , heathen !, 
  that 's what you get for turning your back on holy mother church and living in a nation of lutherite apostates !, 
  same reason you sanction other occupied territories , to make occupation more costly . 
  they probably have limited resources and had to devote them in a way that would cover as much of the world 's energy consumption as possible .

  [ holy shit !, 
  are you me ? 
  damn . 
  us again . 
   what do people value ? 
  we try to look up to countries like switzerland , austria , germany and i guess scandinavian countries as well . 
  the values those countries have in common are order , efficiency , low corruptability and some others i ca n't think of right now . 
  those i would say are the main things archetypal slovenian would value . 
  some of those qualities we posses already some are hopefully yet to be achieved . 
   what quirks do they have ? 
  no idea . 
   what is the national mood ? 
  the national mood right now and for the last couple of years is extreme dissatisfaction with the government . 
  that is occassionaly broken for a short period whenever our sportsmen do well . 
   what are the politics ? 
  do n't know myself . 
   are the people particularly religious ? 
  not really . 
  according to this data from 2002 , 58 % of people declared themselves of catholic faith . 
  i do n't know how that compares to other countries . 
   what is the relationship between the youth and the elderly ? 
  distanced . 
  like they do n't acknowledge each other 's existence . 
   what are the national past times ? 
  hiking . 
  definitely hiking . 
   what are the people most proud of ? 
  nothing . 
  even though we have a lot to be proud of for a country our size . 
   what are they most ashamed of ? 
  nothing crosses my mind .

  [ youtube trending slovenia begs to differ . 
  pretty much nobody knew about her . 
  i remember coming across her by accident when browsing the vast internetz . 
  it went something like this : listen to mac miller -  find out about [ donald trump song ] ( https://youtu.be/74tfs8r_smi ) -  type his name into google ( knew nothing about him back then but figured it must be someone important considering songs being made about him by artist like mac miller ) -  check out his wiki page -  see who he is married to -  figure that that name sound kinda slovene-like -  learn about melanija knavs . 
  seemed cool enough . 
  had no idea it would go down like this , though . 
  damn . 
  [ just type `` juncker funny '' in youtube . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/v2qrarlze-o ), 
  ah yes , i 've seen this on tv here in slovenia . 
  a company went or was about to go bankrupt so people organized themselves and are now leading it . 
  i think you would get more responses if you would describe what `` worker cooperatives '' is .

  i use slovenian if possible . 
  i was surprised when i found out how many words derivate from german language are still commonly used in common language . 
  example ( english - official slovenian - common slovenian - german equivalent ) : time - \u010cas - cajt - zeit there is even slovenized italian curse word : porkamadona . 
  i see one from my room 's window . 
  it is next to the red cross . 
  and in general i think it can be seen at official buildings ( [ municipality building ] ( http://kraji.eu/pictures/gorenjska/cerklje_na_gorenjskem_sencur_z_okolico/sencur/obcina_sencur/dsc_0072_sencur_obcina_sencur_big.jpg ) ) and events ( [ government making a statement ] ( http://www.sloveniatimes.com/modules/uploader/uploads/aktualno/podobe1/cai32jqwaaaid3w.jpg-large.jpg ) ) . 
  what ? 
  did you read what i wrote in the body ? 
  it happened to me that i picked sloven\u010dina instead of sloven\u0161\u010dina when picking language . 
  / r/ireland . 
  according to 4chan americans poop in the stores . 
  he means sea access . 
  spanish weather means temepratures well above 30 \u00b0 c. 
  you lot complain when it gets hotter than 20 \u00b0 c. 
  never did . 
  that us and slovakia are very similair countries . 
  we do n't have any jokes about jews , though . 
  / r/france, 
  lately i play victoria 2 . 
  so you are asking not about people 's opinions on tank deployment in europe but about posts regarding the topic in / r/europe . 
  correct ? 
  if so , i do n't mind . 
  i mean that subreddit is for things related to europe so i do n't see a problem . 
  not the highest resolution but it is a small town and [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/74ktsv4.jpg ) is the best one . 
  i 'm very ignorant of my country 's politics but from the unavoidable media attention etc. 
  i can gather that it would be either janez jan\u0161a ( right wing politician ) or milan ku\u010dan ( retired left wing politician and ex-president ) . 
  i learned about him from [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/74tfs8r_smi ) song . 
  4chan , i think . 
  croatia - i enjoyed my holidays there so i guess i like their climate , beaches and other things that go with that . 
  the people we interacted with were alright as well . 
  austria - i guess an average slovenian appreciates the way their country is ran . 
  i especially like the mountain towns ( few houses , which are similar to the ones we have , beautiful mountainous landscape ) . 
  italy - the country with one of the richest histories right next door . 
  makes for a nice trip . 
  or so i have been told . 
  hungary - hmmm ... 
  they do n't cause any trouble . 
  they are there , doing their thing . 
  `` beating a dead horse . '', 
  that is the latest one . 
  i would suggest you to go to / r/russia with this . 
  from what i have seen they will be glad to help . 
  triglav national park . 
  edit : [ some things to keep in mind . 
  ] ( http://www.tnp.si/experience/c202/ ), 
  circa a month in croatia and a couple of hours in austria and italy . 
  shit , you are right . 
  you woud be surprised how many people name their kids/change their names because of the spelling , not the sound . 
  do n't plan on having children but french jean sounds like a nice name . 
  what was it about japan that shocked you ? 
  i know one person who has on multiple occassions clearly stated he is an atheist . 
  - why is there no santa claus in australia ?

   silently judging ah , the best kind of judging ... 
  i 'd personally rather be under austria and being looked down at than being part of croatia and also being looked down at . 
  come on , you of all people should know better than to engage in a discussion with the guy . 
  because he 's not trying to discuss anything . 
   austrians lock their children in basements oh wow ... 
  i did n't mean jokes per se , more like teasing . 
   it 's that , if someone was known to be jewish by their peers , would they be treated differently ? 
  probably not , apart from jokes about money . 
  i 'm sure some people will call that antisemitism but those people are idiots so their opinion does n't count . 
  tolerance . 
  if you read carefully and slowly , you 'll see those things were mentioned by him first ( except the * self centric as fuck * part ) . 
  i was just trying to explain not liking something about someone does not mean you hate someone . 
  i did not realize this was such a hard concept to grasp . 
  but i suppose it makes sense in a way . 
  what would be better for that ? 
  ~ ~ what would be better for that ? 
  graz or villach ? ~ ~ edit : i meant this as a question to what / u/xorangethunder said , but accidentally replied to your comment , sorry about that . 
  how are you not yet banned here ? 
  i just realized i owe you an apology . 
  when i said * americans * i expected you to know i actually meant * some americans * , not * all americans * . 
  but when you said * europeans * i went of about how we 're not all the same . 
  which makes me a hypocritical cunt . 
  sorry about that . 
  now i feel bad :|, 
   america is n't a hive-mind either but people seem content to believe that we are all trigger happy , `` self-centric as fuck '' , lazy , ignorant people . 
  ** people ** do n't think you 're all trigger happy , self centric as fuck , lazy and ignorant . 
  there is no doubt a group of unspecified size , who thinks ** all ** americans are ignorant . 
  almost certainly there is another group who thinks ** all ** americans are trigger happy . 
  sometimes they overlap and some people think ** all ** americans are ignorant ** and ** trigger happy . 
  no doubt a group exists whose members believe ** all ** americans are just perfect . 
  on the second thought , it probably does n't ... 
  but there is a much greater group of people , who think ** some ** americans are ignorant . 
  just because you had the bad luck to stumble across the first group it does n't mean europeans hate america . 
  is this something you can wrap your head around ? 
   also i guess i just do n't get the dichotomy of people think the us is harmful to the world but at the same time want us forces in their country and want military alliances with the us . 
  generally , people who think america is harmful to the world do n't want us forces in their country . 
  it 's also possible to think america is harmful to the world , but is good for europe . 
  is it two-faced ? 
  sure it is , but still it happens . 
   but if ** europeans ** believe that america as a country/government is overall a negative force oh for fucks sake ... can you please understand that * europeans * is n't this homogeneous blob but about 700 million individuals , who are n't connected in a hive mind and all think exactly the same damn thing . 
  clearly , * europeans * also think america is overall a positive force in the world . 
  or at the very least think that while america might do more bad than good , it 'd still benefit us to kiss ass . 
   surely you do n't support your country having an alliance/affiliation with them ? 
  which also does n't mean you hate someone . 
  the world is n't black and white . 
   on the other hand a significant number of europeans hate americans thinking americans are self centric as fuck does not mean we hate them . 
  thinking they 're idiots does not mean we hate them . 
  thinking us does more harm than good does n't mean we hate them . 
  calm the fuck down . 
  i 'm not going to argue with you about if europeans even think this about americans . 
  because i 'm sure you 'll be able to find a shit load of europeans who 'll point at least a single thing they do n't agree with americans . 
  either with their government , politicians , individuals they might now ... no one is perfect . 
  just because you do n't agree with every single thing someone does or thinks it does n't mean you hate them . 
  i know that might be hard to accept for someone who has been told their entire life they live in the best country in the world , but that 's their problem . 
  i would suggest you try to avoid the train between ljubljana and budapest , if at all possible . 
  it starts in the morning and takes 8 hours so you 'll waste the whole day on it . 
  but it is cheap , the cheapest one way is $ 9 per person . 
  you could maybe travel between ljubljana and budapest via zagreb . 
  it takes even longer but you switch trains in zagreb and have about an hour to kill , so you could have a quick look around zagreb as well ? 
  just do n't forget croatia is not in schengen , so that ** might ** complicate things a bit . 
  there are more trains between vienna and ljubljana and the journey takes * only * 6 hours and you can take an afternoon train . 
  and if you want to spend a day or two in graz and continue to slovenia from there , that 's even less time wasted on the train . 
  eu alone has over half a billion people with about 200 million more in non-eu countries . 
  do you genuinely believe a majority ( or any significant number for that matter ) hold such extreme opinions the op described ? 
  because you * frequently see people on reddit talking * ? 
  come on ... 
  has nothing to do with him being eastern european . 
  and i 'm sure someone is going to argue about that anyway . 
  it 's just that the guy is a troll . 
  and does shit like this on every subredidt until he gets banned . 
  an which point he creates a new account and continues doing it . 
  needs a monocle and a top hat . 
  i know some people who have ( or had ) the same breed of dog . 
  they are ** all ** named * barney * ... 
  most people i know that have pets treat them as family members . 
  there are laws against animal cruelty , but i 'm not to familiar with them . 
  the question is if he 's getting paid to take integration courses or is he on welfare that is conditioned on taking the integration course . 
  which as far as i am concerned are two different things . 
  i thought you meant like ... ` bonus ' to cover expenses ( lunch and transport ) . 
  you got that going on too ? 
   bonuses what kind ? 
  minimum * wage * is $ 790 per month , before taxes . 
  and employees are required to get an untaxed * bonus * to cover certain expenses . 
  which bumps it up slightly . 
  vat is either 0 % , 9.5 % or 22 % . 
  why would i expect people to * just know * ? 
  net or gross ? 
  ah yes . 
  it formats it as a numbered list . 
  it 's annoying as hell sometimes . 
   1 . is now a hiloday again :d 1st january was always a holiday ... you mean the 2nd of january , which was a holiday , but then it was n't . 
  and now it is again ... because reasons ... 
   we had to know types of soil , vegetation , climate etc. 
  of every continent . 
  exactly . 
  countries were n't the focus . 
  they were more like a side thing i felt like . 
   i had it on matura . 
  i had geography on matura as well . 
  fun times ...

i will for the regions i 've never been : molise well obviously , it does n't exist . 
  its only racist if you miss the point entirely . 
  its meant to make fun of everyone and everything with no qualms about it being inappropriate . 
  it comes from krautchan afterall . 
  you have no idea what a traffic jam is unless you 've done the strunjan - piran road in summer . 
  there needs to be a decent alternative road made because shit is just ridiculous . 
  considering most of the traffic is causing by the germans , austrians & italians driving to croatia , if more of those tourists actually stuck around it would be better . 
  this way they do n't just buy the vignette and that 's their only interaction with our economy . 
  basically all slovenian news outlets use it as a source . 
  i 'll have you know we put all three of our soldiers on high alert after this vile act against our serbian brothers . 
  winning the special olympics still counts as winning , right ? 
  there 's also a small amount of oil in prekmurje iirc , although its unlikely it has much of an impact on that  oil : $ 1.4 billion ( 5.3 % ), 
  chinese taipei *, 
  there 's a crapton of ex-yu people there and the locals love \u0107evapi & la\u0161ko pivo . 
  its very balkan . 
   people who do n't want to work  montenegro checks out, 
  good luck communicating with your weird russian-polish mix ( which are very different so idk how it would even sound like ) with anyone in the south slav language group . 
  aside from some basic words that are pretty much the same across all slavic languages , you would n't be able to go far . 
  i 've never seen it spelt `` giudo '' . 
  always judo .

  [ piran ] ( http://www.portoroz.si/si/imagelib/12-land/default/images/piran/piranska_modrina.jpg ) surely deserves a mention , for the sake of variety if not anything else . 
  ethnically ? 
  sure , could be . 
  but he still plays for your national team . 
  played for koper some years ago . 
  was pretty good . 
  also probably only estonian we know . 
  how could we ignore you . 
  you ( & kosovars ) are like our go-to guys for construction work or bakeries . 
  too many references no one knows outside for it not to be . 
  montenegro thing is most likely intentionally backwards . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/top_gear_ ( 2002_tv_series ), 
   not that i think its like you people skipped reading comprehension classes, 
  only if they go in the mountains, 
  i 'm sorry , but did we read/watch the same sources ? 
   http://4d.rtvslo.si/arhiv/tednik/174457467 in this we see a bunch of albanian students learning and speaking ( not amazingly , but one of the kids speaking has only been there a year ) slovenian , we see a bunch of older albanians speaking close to perfect ( if not perfect ) slovenian and one of them even won an award for her volunteer work . 
  there 's even a pie chart at 5:17 that shows the foreign population of velenje being two thirds bosnian . 
  ( kosovo just on 5 % ) hell this piece of news is the perfect counter-argument to your point . 
  we see them integrating , helping others integrate , or already integrated . 
   http://www.mnz.gov.si/si/novinarsko_sredisce/novica/browse/1/article/12208/10011/  http://www.vlada.si/fileadmin/dokumenti/si/projekti/2015/begunci/aktivno_za_strpnost_publikacija.pdf these are government publications that tackle the `` how to help people integrate '' questions . 
  nothing about albanians causing problems . 
   http://www.rtvslo.si/zdravje/novice/zdravstvo-je-dobilo-novo-orodje-za-boljse-komuniciranje/412195 again , nothing about them causing problems . 
  just a piece of news about the doctors & co. getting some help with interacting with people from different cultures . 
   http://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/zahtevali-znanje-albanscine.html a piece of news on velenje 's hospital looking for a nurse & a doctor that speak albanian . 
  while you and others surely see something wrong with this , its a completely reasonable request given the kosovar community that is there . 
  in the video we saw them learning but this is not a fast process , and having multi-lingual medical staff is always a plus . 
  nobody is forcing the rest of the staff to speak it , mind . 
  oh , and it says nowhere that albanians are causing problems . 
   yes , slovenes first and have absolutely no issues curbing some people 's rights . 
  it 's our homeland , they have their own and are free to move out . 
  slovenes first huh ? 
  what about our ethnic minorities ? 
  the italians and the hungarians ? 
  do they not count ? 
  what about our fellow slovenes over the border ? 
  should they go back to `` our country '' just because its `` their homeland '' and the italians or austrians or hungarians or croatians decided that they do n't have rights anymore ? 
  so that is why they insist on getting sunburned . 
  red orkz go fastah, 
   do you even read the news ? 
  i work in a news station . 
  i do n't exactly go out and seek all the news there are when i 'm not at work , but when i am , i kinda ca n't escape it . 
  in the past three months i 've never seen a news article about albanians causing problem even close to making the evening news . 
  the most i 've heard was from a friend that works as an elementary school teacher that his \u0161iptar students are undisciplined and do n't want to learn . 
  this is an issue , sure . 
  but then i remember that half my class back in the day was lazy and unmotivated and not exactly disciplined either . 
  and the only two kosovars were actually quite chill . 
  kids gon na kid . 
  as for your articles , what issues do you see ? 
  its mostly about preparing medical personnel to deal with people that do not speak slovene ( and not only albanians , from what i could see , since it mentions the refugees ) . 
  which is a very good idea , you save lives this way . 
  our language is retardedly complex ( for a slavic one anyway ) and we ca n't expect newcomers to immediately speak it . 
  they 'll learn eventually because you ca n't really function in slovenia without speaking slovene ( or serbo-croatian , but that 's another story ) . 
   and there 's always the question , why do n't we improve the economic conditions for our people to have more kids instead of subsidizing albanian ones with our welfare system . 
  ah yes , the age-old question . 
  first slovenes , then the rest , right ? 
  not like they live in the same country and are citizens with the same rights ( or becoming , anyway ) , right ? 
  `` now '' ? 
  they 've been coming since the late '90s / early ' 00s . 
  most of the bakeries & kebab shops are owned and ran by them . 
  what problems are they causing ? 
  if you edit in under a minute or two , no * will ever show up . 
  not if they are the religious types . 
  then you just pay them in \u0107evapi and burek . 
  we did learn a little bit about it in elementary school and during schooltrips ( you ca n't go near the triglav and not talk about where the name is from and & the zlatorog/goldhord legend ) , but that 's about it . 
  vast majority of them yea . 
  although i 've come across a couple that were from albania proper . 
  our bakeries too . 
  and construction workers . 
  or , the shorter version : slavic tribes started migrating towards the west & the balkans only around the 6th century , a bit after ol' aleksandar makedonski 's exploits , 
  yes please , i 'd like to actually be able to cross the border in summer in a reasonable timeframe . 
   it 's in the ugliest place on earth what about biella ? 
  and sheep . 
  when i was in high school , the girls were the ones drinking more than everyone . 
  they would down those fruit-flavoured vodkas like it was apple juice . 
  and , well , eventually puke but that 's another story . 
  columbus landed in lisbon first * when returning from the first voyage , not italy . 
  later on they continued towards spain . 
  * in mainland europe , he landed at the azores before that . 
  city centre is pretty nice tbh , op just took the pic from a less nice part .

  his point is that in resisting one antihuman regime they allied with the only one that was even worse . 
  i understand you 're advanced civilization , so can you explain to us barbaroi where exactly is the joke ? 
   i do n't mean to be rude , but this comment is an epitome of vagueness . 
  i 'm certain there are multiple reasons for this . 
  thank you , based missionaries . 
  i noticed . 
  does n't make it any more true . 
  whatever i 've been given in life is the result of hard work of my parents and grandparents and so on , and their whole generations . 
  i 'm not going to piss all over their life 's work . 
  those who are n't make excellent cannon fodder . 
  8 april 1204 was way way worse . 
  b\u00fcy\u00fck birader is talking to you !, 
  and there 's even a pretty good movie about it with rade \u0160erbed\u017eija . 
  i actually know that , i was just making a joke off a string of greek words . 
  hubris is hubris , ate is mind-blindness , nemesis is gods ' vengeance , tisis is destruction of the person who committed hubris . 
  it 's the basic plotline of a whole lot of myths and attic tragedies . 
  and some evil soul just had to downvote this . 
  krvavice 4 life . 
  any such post about ukraine that comes from russia i 'll gladly disregard as kremlin propaganda . 
   hubris ate nemesis tisis this is all greek to me . 
  sure , whatever you tell yourself . 
  i so wish you and those who think like you live a long and peaceful life , and that at the moment of your death eu is still around . 
  i read this in benigni 's voice . 
  i make a lot of sweet stuff at home , from marble cake to poppy roll to gibanica to mousse , but i simply do n't dare to make profiteroles . 
  for some reason they seem extremely tricky to make , especially that dough . 
  am i prejudiced ? 
   it was demolished a few months ago . 
  why ? 
  that 's cute . 
  i was always bilingual in croatian/italian and later i had to learn slovene up to native level . 
  add english and imagine how a conversation with me sounds . 
  i surely hope you voted remain , otherwise this would be just too hypocritical . 
   the guy wants to destroy national identity and culture which is textbook marxism . 
  i 'd like to see that textbook . 
  sure , that 's why some of us have bidets . 
  the turd goes into the toilet bowl . 
  you do n't shit into bidet . 
  there are trees in that forest . 
  of course there is . 
  there is no difference between polish and ukrainian keyboard warriors though . 
  seriously , balkan level shit . 
  so big and fat it needed to be repeated . 
  okay , good points . 
  i noticed . 
  they are annoying me the same way croat nationalists glorifying usta\u0161e and rewriting history annoy me . 
  it 's darkly funny in the way that i 've already seen everything that 's happening in ukraine right now . 
  on the other hand , i also noticed some poles foaming at the mouth at the mention of forced polonization and ethnic cleansing . 
  `` that does n't matter !, 
  they were worse ! '', 
  [ there was one the second time , but it ended up behind the barbed wire . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_von_ossietzky ), 
  oh , yes , forgot that one . 
  well , it 's still possible that the proofstering wrong too . 
  i 've just grown accustomed to double-checking anything that comes from russia , since it seems their narrative creators are always habitual liars . 
  that 's horrible . 
  just horrible . 
  like op said , ww2 was just too huge for a human mind to comprehend . 
  we get lost in the numbers , the battles and the events , and we simply ca n't keep track of millions of individual horror stories that did n't have any effect on the outcome . 
  but it 's those stories that make the war horrible , not the great decisions that great men make . 
  that 's also the reason why i ultimately prefer movies like cross of iron , das boot , come and see or fury to any of the war epics . 
  only they really make you feel you 're watching guys like you and me , of flesh and blood , and only such movies give you a mild taste of how frightful it all was . 
   on the topic of eastern front i can recommend the movie come and see . 
  i could n't sleep after watching that movie for the first time . 
  that image of the raped girl with the whistle haunted me for weeks afterwards . 
  i 've seen a man die , and that girl had dead eyes . 
  i do n't want to know how the makers of the movie did that . 
  another hard-hitting moment was when later , while researching for a table-top game i was making with my brother , i found a series of pics from the massacre where my great-grandfather was killed . 
  it was almost the same thing . 
  apart from obvious differences - the quisling clowns were italians , and they did n't burn them inside a church but inside a house . 
  but the rest was the same : they did put those that were n't burned alive on trucks and drive them off in an unknown direction . 
  there was a dick with a camera taking photos of people being killed . 
  there was even a nazi bitch present that went partying with soldiers after the killings were over . 
  after i read and viewed the photos , i immediately thought that i 've seen a movie version of my great-grandpa 's death . 
  and then i thought that i understand why my dad told me when i dated a german girl : `` it 's cool with me , but your grandpa would n't approve . '', 
  google again , in russian . 
  thw thing is , it 's just perfect , is n't it ? 
  that diary is some high level poetry . 
  it pushes all the right buttons , unlike anne frank diary that wastes so much time with family intrigues and anatomical details of her vagina . 
  another thing that grabbed the doubter 's attention was that it seems written with the same pencil despite the dates being months apart . 
  plus , the letter \u044f , which is the trickiest letter to write in russian cyrillic alphabet , is written super properly , above the level of a 3rd grade kid . 
  and it was found in stalin 's ussr , not exactly known for it 's devotion to truth . 
  in the words of another writer and gulag inmate karlo \u0160tajner , `` whatever the government told , it was likely that the truth is exact opposite . 
  no other country lied as much as ussr . '', 
  the only problem is it 's likely a forgery . 
  i 'm not sure what song you 're talking about , how does it smell ? 
  cool !, 
  i 'll definitely check it out when it happens . 
  there actually is n't that much dislike , otherwise we would be hearing horror stories about ukrainian immigration to poland . 
  it 's just that this kind of topic attracts a certain kind of people present in any country on this blue planet . 
  that 's why you stayed under occupation for 45 more years after the end of war . 
  you lost . 
  badly . 
  and according to your post :  man , you lost the war ... that gave germans , soviets and anyone else who got lost in polish woods the right to do with poles how they pleased . 
  the problem with chauvinists is that they successfully appropriated the nationalist label , just like commies hijacked labour movement . 
  nice . 
  so , um ... what 's going to be happening in the city ? 
  you won in 1939 ? 
  itt : poles and ukrainians find out their grandpas had blood on their hands and proceed to have a full-blown meltdown . 
  rare voices of sanity are moderately upvoted , but ultimately drowned out in sea of screeching . 
  patriotism = i love my land .

  for example , they could form a caliphate and obtain nuclear weapons . 
   let the bundeswehr take a breath . 
  given the problems it has what problems do you speak of ? 
  is there a broom shortage ? 
  the upside being that you do n't really need roads anymore . 
   how can something be implausible when it 's happened ? 
  implausible things do sometimes happen . 
  if i wanted to say something could not possibly happen , i 'd use the word * impossible * . 
  but anyway , is there solid evidence that it actually did happen ? 
  from what i 've seen , i 'd say it could have happened and i do n't have an opinion on it one way or the other . 
  is there some other evidence than the kurir article ? 
   well , estonia does not want to be nordic were the polandball comics lying to me ? 
   as well as serbia targeting it 's own people just to declare us terrorists you do realize that no one believes you when you say shit like that , right ? 
  edit : sorry , i see that you did n't just make that up now ( i 'm assuming you were talking about [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panda_bar_incident ) ) . 
  but when you are making claims that sound implausible , you really should be more specific , so that we can look this stuff up . 
   then why does he go to the trouble of not having * free elections * well , that would just be un-russian . 
  and i like turtles . 
  a more accurate analogy would be having to pay a tax every time you tell someone which radio station is playing the song . 
  which is just as ridiculous . 
   then they chanted death to europe and it did n't bother me because they were still just chanting . 
  ftfy, 
  i was making a joke about greater serbia . 
  like , there is no such thing as hungary , all of it should actually just be the northern part of serbia . 
  we are n't considering it . 
   you ca n't slightly win election , and become a dictator and yet that 's exactly what hitler did . 
   hungarian no such thing . 
  is actually northern serbia . 
  this is off topic , but albert einstein was actually fucking a serbian girl ( also married her and had children with her ) . 
  we do n't need to go through your post history . 
  this post of yours is the most severe case of butthurt i 've seen on reddit today . 
   secondly , the `` virovitica-karlovac-karlobag '' line advocated by greater serbia proponents would have stripped croatia of far more than 50 % it would have , but it was only advocated by the radical party , which was not even the largest party in serbia at the time . 
  implying that was a position of serbia or the serbs is intellectually dishonest . 
   and try to dismember croatia instead of letting it go peacefully that 's one way of putting it . 
  you could also say that croatia denied the right to self-determination to regions with serb majority . 
   yet serbs wanted to essentialy chop off 50 + % of croatian territory did they ? 
  in 1991 , serbian krajina was about 30 % of croatia 's area and about 7 % of its population . 
   inb4 i am turk i ca n't say shit aaaand you 've managed to play the victim in a completely unrelated comment section . 
  where do you live ? 
  [ they made internet access a legal right ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/10461048 ) , so i guess they are taking their internet connection seriously . 
   so go an pick a eu member where jobs for unqualified workers are still offered and which eu members would that be ? 
  that looks it was written by a person with a narcissistic personality disorder . 
   i think it 's mind-boggling that after the last 15 years people still think they can fight terrorism with military strikes well , you can fight is with military strikes . 
  you know , the organization that claims to be a state and controls a large territory . 
  of course . 
  first those war mongering maniacs stir up shit and then they run away from the situation like the pacifist pussies they are . 
   yeah i got it but what 's your point ? 
  the last 8-9 years growth in productivity has been modest to say the least . 
  my point was that it does n't make sense to take the peak of the bubble as the reference point . 
  the bubble was an anomaly and it does n't represent a normal or expected state of economy . 
  it makes much more sense to look at the data since after the bubble has burst . 
  and if you look at the data since 2009 till present , you get a yearly growth of 7 sek/h , and not 2 sek/h . 
  that is not dramatically lower than the growth before the bubble , which was about 11 sek/h per year . 
  to better understand what a poor choice of a reference point the year 2007 is , consider this example . 
  if a worker in 2007 worked for an hour building a house , than his productivity would be computed based on the value of that house in 2007 . 
  but the values of houses in 2007 were way overinflated . 
  people were n't actually paying that much for houses because the houses were worth that much to them ( as a place to live in ) , but as an investment , because they were expecting the prices to just keep rising at an unsustainable rate . 
  in 2009 , the value of that house was way less than in 2007 , so you ca n't really say that the worker actually produced the value that is included in the 2007 productivity data . 
  you can gat the data if you go [ here ] ( http://www.ekonomifakta.se/fakta/ekonomi/produktion-och-investeringar/produktivitetsutvecklingen-i-naringslivet/?graph=/17159/1/all/ ) and click on `` tabell '' ( the button just above the graph ) . 
  it seems it is n't possible to link to the table directly . 
   is that productivity growth , swedish stats ? 
  yes . 
  i 've copied the data from the table on the page that you have linked to . 
   and here is another graph where our stagnating productivity growth is painfully apparent . 
  and [ here ] ( https://i.imgur.com/5jx67js.jpg ) is how you should actually interpret this data . 
  the hump between 2003 and 2009 represents the bubble and the financial crisis . 
  the growth after the crisis ( about 7 per year ) is significantly lower than the growth before the bubble ( about 11 per year ) , but it is not dramatically lower and it is definitely not stagnation . 
  edit : fixed the growth numbers . 
  you seem to be forgetting that the uk is largely populated by chavs . 
  i 'd bet on putin . 
  now that 's a very clear case of whataboutism . 
  true , but a significant part of the people in some of the volunteer battalions are . 
  of course , it 's wise to avoid needless provocation . 
  but if someone responds to being poked by slitting the other persons throat , there 's clearly something wrong with him . 
   you can offend people in whatever the fuck way you want unless you live in germany , and say that the holocaust did n't happen . 
  then you may go to prison . 
  they did n't `` poke back '' , they killed three people . 
   they were calling ukrainian soldiers `` neo-nazi jews '' source ? 
  and calling them neo-nazi ( without `` jews '' ) is n't really that strange , since quite a lot of them are in fact neo-nazi . 
  they also like to slaughter ethnic minorities and destroy their villages from time to time . 
  i just love how everyone pretends russia does n't have a shitload of nukes while discussing this . 
  what if i told you that the turkish state has killed about 50 thousand kurds and destroyed 4000 kurdish villages in the past 30 years ? 
   as for phrase `` with some help from the uk and the us '' , you should do some research on that topic , that being ww2 i was thinking about the [ huge difference ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_front_%28world_war_ii%29#/media/file:world-war-ii-military-deaths-in-europe-by-theater-year.png ) between the casualties ( counting both the allies and the axis casualties ) on the eastern and the western front . 
  this suggests that most of the fighting was actually done on the eastern front , mostly between the ussr and the germans . 
   molotov ribbentrop pact i fail to see how this is relevant here ? 
  yes , russia was n't at war with germany until 1941 , but that does n't change the fact that they did more fighting , overall , than any other ally . 
   lend lease i 've looked that up now , and i see that the amount of goods the soviets got from the us really was huge . 
  i 'll concede that this amount of arms , fuel , and food may have been crucial for the soviet victory on the eastern front . 
   russia is capable only of bullying smaller countries they defeated the nazi germany ( with some help from the uk and the us ) . 
  they are enhanced crowd control structures , goddammit . 
  the crosses that some christians typically wear are hardly even noticeable , they really are n't comparable to a hijab . 
  you are actually not proposing that the hijab should have no more consequence than anything else , you are saying it should be treat differently than other items of clothing because some people wear it for religious reasons . 
   when it 's clearly about one single item of clothing but it obviously is n't about a single item of clothing , it 's about a very overt expression of ones religious beliefs . 
  you were reducing it to just a single item of clothing in order to make a point in your original comment , but you clearly acknowledge that it has some other significance . 
  just make up your mind already - is it just a scarf , in which case it really is weird to have it wrapped around ones head in a job interview , or is it not just a scarf ? 
  i was replying to :  i could n't imagine being turned down for a job because of a fucking scarf here , you were presenting one 's outfit as something completely irrelevant , and that just is n't true . 
  your appearance affects how other people will perceive you , and how you choose to appear tells something about you . 
  and as such it is relevant to hiring and other situations when someone must assess you in a brief encounter . 
  the interviewer will think you are weird as fuck , and because of that he will feel it 's risky to hire you . 
  he will likely go with some other candidate , whom he will see as a safer bet ( unless you are much a much better candidate in other aspects ) . 
  of course he wo n't tell you any of that .

  envy . 
  it 's our national trait , and everything bad about slovenia stems from it . 
  envy makes us spend our forces trying to one-up or fuck over our neighbors instead of collaborating for common good . 
  envy makes us invest heavily in keeping up a cute facade while nobody takes care of rotten supporting walls . 
  envy makes it difficult for us to step up for a common cause , because of the `` everything 's good as long as the next guy is worse off than me '' mentality . 
  envy forces everyone who lives in slovenia to be mediocre . 
  envy forces anyone who refuses to be mediocre out of slovenia . 
  i forgive you . 
  you 're french after all . 
  germany had powerful industrial base , hyperinflation did n't last for long and there were five-six years of economic boom before the great depression . 
  hvala !, 
  i heard you 're not supposed to answer phone with `` alo ? '', 
  in hungary , because it means `` is it horse ? '' . 
  any truth in that ? 
  yes they do . 
  in regular conversation they never say `` blagodarja '' , always `` mersi '' . 
  and why not ? 
  almost all our countries need a good clean-up . 
  ( i 'm not sure about czechia , do n't hear anything from there . ), 
  as long as those fucks are in government and have parliamentary majority , they will try to pull the same shit again some other way .

   sounds nsfl ftfy, 
  those people usually have a vested interest in bosnian breakup . 
  so you skip over all the juicy bits  it 's not just about inventing and ommitting facts . 
  i think more about the overrall narrative , what gets emphasized , what does n't , such things . 
  i think about , for example , making a huge deal about medieval principalities we actually do n't know much about apart from the fact they existed . 
  or the old story about our people being eternal innocent victims who never did anything wrong . 
  and the eternal whataboutism ( `` how could you do srebrenica ? '', 
  `` and how could you do jasenovac ? '', 
  `` yeah ? 
  and who killed radi\u0107 ? '', 
  `` and do you know how much we suffered in ww1 ? '', 
  and so on . ), 
  in bulgarian case , i was really taken aback when i realized they seemed to genuinely believe they won all the battles and lost all the wars , except for ww2 , which they fought on allied side ( wtf ??! ) . 
  the mantra about three seas and 500 years under turks was cute for a while and became annoying the 100th time i heard it . 
  also , when i told them , as a fun fact , about their wars with serbia and croatia in the middle ages , i got the answer `` well that 's the first time i heard we invaded somebody '' . 
  seriously . 
    as the european union has a single currency , the euro  the first sentence excludes my country and many others from the `` proposition '' that 's for us who have euro to decide . 
  madman theory does n't mean the president is actually a mad man , smartass , just that he acts like one to stay ahead of his rivals . 
  that 's an old tactic btw , nixon did it . 
  and that does n't work okay with euro in the mix . 
  i might have misunderstood you . 
  i thought you meant competing economic systems among eu states . 
  as in , one country is more socialist , another more liberal ... 
  this was very witty . 
  you 're a witty person . 
  ca n't do it with euro . 
  you 'd , of course , rather ditch euro , because you do n't lose anything by doing so . 
  okay . 
  it was all a matter of selecting the right orange for president .

  ljubljana has 130 % more average anual precipitation than london .

  i also refresh my knowledge of geography . 
  i love everything . 
  swimming , athletics , gymnastics , judo , fencing , kayak , canoe , whatever is on the tv really . 
  i really enjoy watching sports that usually do n't get coverage here like fencing and diving . 
  by that logic all sport events , national celebrations etc. 
  would be nationalistic conventions lol, 
  you do n't study sociology and philosophy in high school ?

  and the two who blew themself up in paris were what ?

  they were terrorist attacks and there could have been many casulaties .

  what browser do you use ? 
  chrome googles it for you and then there 's google browser . 
  you know , you can just type your search query into an adress bar and it will automatically google it for you ? 
  haha, 
   it translates them into your language and shows results for the translated search !, 
  does n't happen on google.si : /, 
   but at least until now , none of them have committed any terror acts . 
  that 's not true . 
  the guy who stabbed 5 in reutlingen was a refugee , the guy who blew himself up in front of a nightclub in ansbach was a refugee . 
  another 4 have been caught plotting a terrorist attack in d\u00fcseldorf , hundreds have been linked to terrorism . 
  the guy who plotted atat\u00fcrk airport terror attack was a refugee from chechnya . 
  two of the attackers at stade de france came to france with the migrant flow last year . 
  ticks are quite scary imo . 
  lyme disease can destroy your life . 
   they do n't pose a danger to people , unless you 're really unlucky . 
  but people pose danger to them . 
  it 's a law here that you need a wicker basket and you need to cut off mycellium in the woods . 
  mushroom picking is very common in various countries in europe . 
  my relatives go apeshit crazy when it comes to mushroom picking . 
  they drive across the country to get their dose of picking . 
  during mushroom seasons you 'll see cars parked by the road next to a forest because they 're searching for mushrooms . 
  also dangerous picking is wild garlic . 
  aparently there are poisonous plants that look very similar and every year a bunch of people end up hospitalized due to poisoning . 
  mr. google said that between 2009 and 2012 there was 16 reported deaths caused by animals or insects . 
  1 death due to dag attack . 
  6 deaths due to allergic reaction to bee , wasp , or hornet . 
  9 deaths due to bites or other injuries caused by other mammals ( bears , cows , bulls , etc. ) . 
  probably the most dangerous thing in slovenia are ticks . 
  we have the most lyme disease patients per capita in the world . 
  we have 3 types of poisonous snakes . 
  horned viper , asp viper and common european viper . 
  last fatal bite was in 1999 . 
  in the little sea we have , you can find greater weever , pelagic stingray , jellyfish and sharks . 
  none of them have been deadly so far . 
  at least not in recent history . 
  thanks for showing us what bees and dogs look like !, 
  such interesting and rare animals . 
  til !, 
  we do n't really have swear words here . 
  we do , but they 're strange , therefore no one uses them .

  nisva skupaj krav pasla - we did n't herd cows together . 
  najprej \u0161tal ` ca pol pa krav ` ca - first a barn , then a cow . 
  meaning you need to have a house before a family . 
  as someone else said , school is for studying , extra curricular activities are for after school . 
  we do have school sports leagues like ` school basketball league ' ( \u0160kl ) but it 's nothing serious . 
  kids who compete in these are members of clubs outside of school . 
  there are other between-schools competitions , like chess , futsal , handball , but not many schools are part of it . 
  it 's pretty pointless imo . 
  it 's really hard to say because winters have gotten a lot warmer here in recent years . 
  reading an article that in 2014 we had around a month of temperatures above 0 \u00b0 c in january , half of those above 10 \u00b0 c. 
  that 's consecutive days . 
  when before usual temberatires were -10 to +5 \u00b0 c , we get up to 15 or even more now . 
  it does get cold as well , i remember when we had less than -20 \u00b0 c but that 's rare . 
  the lowest measured temperature was -49 \u00b0 c a few years ago on komna near bohinj ( altitude 1520m ) . 
  we can have huge temperature differences , up to around 28 \u00b0 c in a day . 
  also huge temperature differences between the days . 
  in can be very warm one day and very cold the next . 
  i think the lowest measured temperature in my city was around -27 \u00b0 c. 
  * we do n't get much snow in recent years either . 
  it snows once , maybe twice a year . 
  but it also depends on the region . 
  my region gets little snow , but region in the right foot of our chicken gets quite a bit of it . 
  the average snow fall is around 20cm in the lowlands . 
  this is quite a weird question , i must say . 
  but , we play ` med dvema ognjema ' ( lit . 
  translation ` between two fires ' ) , which is kind of like dodgeball but we usually only use one ball . 
  and we play handball . 
  i 'm pretty sure we would be able to throw things without these sports . 
  kids are taught to throw balls without having a sport in mind . 
  well than perhaps border with poland is not regulated . 
  as i said , border with austria definitely is . 
  newer models of mazda come in this colour .

  oh jeeze , way too much to write here . 
  lots and lots of classics . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.ric.si/mma/2016%20m-slo-2016/2014090112035392/ ) is a catalogue of what 4th graders in gymnasiums need to know for a final exam . 
  literature starts at page 22 , if you 're interested .

  to make this even stranger , we seem to be obsessed with [ veronika deseni\u0161ka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/veronika_of_desenice ) , who was married to frederick ii of celje . 
  i guess the easy answer would probably be turbo folk , both the original balkan version , as our further bastradisation of it , where our `` oberkrainer '' music genre went from sounding something like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uclx522b9c ) to [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfhf67ynp-o ) . 
  well the `` new '' one is actually really old , and does n't represent modern turbo-folk/oberkrainer mix , but it 's the most well known , and the most easy to see the difference , even if you do n't speak slovenian . 
  modern version of this plague on our music industry is more toned down and closer to the traditional version , just that instead of songs about how nice it is to be a beekeeper , or going to the mountains other stuff , it 's all about double-etendre 's , so you get a song about sucking and licking ice-cream , but it 's actually about penis ( what a novel concept ) . 
  but the thing i really really hate is , it 's actually really hard to explain , but i 'll call it our `` colonial mindset '' . 
  not us being colonialists , but us not shedding our `` colonial '' past of being a `` colony '' . 
  that is , people here tend to hold in high regard both austria and germany , under whom we 've lived for around millennia ( cca 980 's - 1918 ) . 
  people here still unironically believe that if we were still ruled by austria or germany , we 'd be better of . 
  and sure germany , i kind of get . 
  they 've got beaten in two world wars , were made to pay for them and yet they still rule europe , both politically and even more economically . 
  but austria is n't really that better than us . 
  they to have huge corruption affairs ( hypo ) , they have corrupt politicians , and so much more . 
  yet people still for some reason believe it to be this promised land . 
  that 's why i call this `` colonial mindset '' , because we 're really similar to many african ( and other ) ex-colonies who are still clinging to their colonial masters , no matter how much they were screwed over by them . 
  if we ( and they ) would stop obsessing with trying to be like them , and try to find out how to be ourselves , we 'd probably fix some of the major issues . 
  and it makes even less sense in our case , because we were part of another multi-national union after austro-hungary , and while sure yugonostalgia is huge here , nobody really tries to base their political and policy opinions on either yugoslavia or any of the successor states . 
  every time something bad happens in politics or economy here , people always go `` this could n't happen in austria '' ( when in many cases it did , any probably even worse . 
  again the hole hypo thing , and carinthia 's - which i think is also linked to it - huge debt ) , and it 's always blamed on our supposed `` balkan mentality '' . 
  i promise to stop ranting soon , but i 'd like to point out that there was a play called hlapci , written back in 1910 which pretty much dealt with this same matter . 
  and it has since then seeped into our `` popular culture '' to that extent that both the word hlapci , as well as one specific quote became a byword for this kind of mentality . 
  btw : hlapci means `` serfs '' . 
  tito did nothing wrong . 
  cromwell did nothing wrong ( sorry ireland ) . 
  mugabe did nothing wrong . 
  we have a thing called `` izredni \u0161tudij '' roughly translated as `` irregular studying '' . 
  i think it was made up for this exact reason . 
  it 's basically a more concise form of lectures , that are mostly in the evening for which you have to pay . 
  the reasoning being , that a ) employed people do n't have time during the day , when they 're at their jobs to go to lectures , and b ) given they have jobs , they can pay for it . 
  but in practice it turned into a great way to go and study what you wanted to , but did n't have the grade average to enrol in . 
  you might have heard that slovenia is one of the few countries that has completely free university up to and including post-grad masters degree . 
  well our free studying is mostly payed for by people who do the irregular studies . 
  it raised all kinds of questions : is it fair that the same education is free for some , but not the others , are the faculties purposely restricting the enrolment into the more popular studies ( through setting how many will they accept in a year ) , to get more irregular students and so on . 
  this was kind of fixed by now making it possible that you can if your average is high enough enrol in regular classes , or transfer from one study to another , if you do some additional exams . 
  but even this kind of raised questions , like is it fair to someone who studied really hard for their entire life , that some `` schmuck '' who barely coasted along can get same education , just because they did the exams , which are in many cases in form of various reports and research papers , where you can easily get someone else to do it for you ... 
  really hard to say . 
  for a moment it felt like it will be iceland , who more or less has already accomplished most of the demands to join , but then decided that their economic crisis is n't that bad , and frozen the negotiations . 
  and every balkan country has loads of things to fix , before they 're ready . 
  bih needs a complete political system overhaul and break from the dayton agreement , which does n't seem attainable in quite a while . 
  serbia has the whole problem with vu\u010di\u0107 , and his bid for more authoritarian rules , i 'm not sure how far along montenegro is , but i assume they would be part of bigger group and wo n't be let in on their own . 
  albania , i do n't think even started negotiations , and kosovo is n't even recognised as a country by loads of un members . 
  so yeah it 's far more likely for either scotland , northern ireland or catalonia to join in next few years than any country from the balkans . 
  for few folk songs i 've heard dealing with this topic , it seems they were what we and germans call gastarbeiter 's , who then slowly decided to stay there . 
  a lot of folk songs deal with topic of man leaving his lover to go work in the usa to get better money . 
  and they supposedly sent money back to their family , so they could i assume join them . 
  there are also loads of short stories , books about it . 
  again the same reason . 
  the biggest reason for emigration was , that peasant families had for some reason primogeniture inheritance . 
  so first usually first son got the entire farm . 
  if it was specified to be divided , it usually happened in the way that first son got the bigger part , and others got smaller ones , and in some cases their land would actually be leased to them , so they were still working on the family farm , and had to give most of their produce to the master of the farm . 
  but that 's the richer peasants . 
  with poorer , where the farm was n't big enough to be divided , the first son would inherit everything , and everyone else would be on their own , to either marry into other family , work as a `` serf '' on a richer farm and so on . 
  so basically emigrating to the usa feel like a opportunity to really change your life and start anew . 
  on other hand women , especially from the littoral area would go work for rich families all over the mediterranean as nannies and general `` cleaning ladies '' . 
  again some would stay , other returned . 
  so that 's the majority of our emigrants , who emigrated for economic reasons . 
  then there 's the second wave of emigrants , the political . 
  they emigrated after wwii , when `` their side '' lost , mostly to argentina , but also to the usa . 
  i 've heard that at least back then ( and to extent even now ) there 's a big difference within the slovenian diaspora , where both `` waves '' do n't really get along . 
  well i 'm sorry , i not that well versed in subdivision of south styria ... 
  here `` hipster '' became a catch-all term to insult everyone trying to keep up with ever changing urban culture . 
  i still think you should visit it . 
  because it 's a bit of an exaggeration , i think you 'll find that most people in ljubljana are really friendly and open . 
  ( but also hipsters ), 
  well i 'm sorry , but celje and velenje are n't that far apart . 
  to me they fell into the same general region , like idrija , cerkno , \u017diri and rovte . 
  i have a suspicion that gavin belson from silicon valley was based on elon musk . 
  for tesla 's , i see them as the cars that rich `` hipsters '' use to flaunt their wealth . 
  that and my friend keeps yapping about them , and how great they are . 
  i honestly do n't care really . 
  sure i support the idea of fully electric cars , but i also do n't have a drivers permit and save the environment by riding a bike , instead of getting a drivers permit and buying a car . 
  i could add few more , now that i think of , but tbh do n't have too many stereotypes about celje . 
  celje/la \u0161ko / velenje ( southwestern styria ) : clinging to the past of counts of celje , while living in one of the most contaminated cities in slovenia ; our major brewery ( recently sold to heineken ) , in past la\u0161ko / union divide was also divide between ljubljana and styria , since merger they 're the same company , i always preferred la\u0161ko ; failing coal-mining economy , that has to be propped up with the most useless and most expensive thermal powerplant in the country , also the home of the biggest statue of tito . 
  zasavje : also really contaminated because of the thermal powerplant / coal-mining duo , home to laibach and communists ( pretty much the same thing ) . 
  the trick is , to only do shitty things to yourself , so nobody outside cares and only people calling it out are from within the country . 
  that 's why our major right-wing party ever so often promises to tell the world/eu what `` we '' did . 
  gorenjska ( upper carniola / northern part of the country ) : funny dialect , they 're really stingy , always cynical and like to complain . 
  dolenjska ( lower carniola / southern part ) : always drunk , they need alcohol to function properly , you start drinking wine at age 2 ( at least ) , they think they have good wine , but it 's actually either just a swill or can literally make you blind ( varies ) . 
  \u0160tajerska ( sytria eastern part ) : stingy , funny dialect - to the point that loads of `` stand-up comedians '' think they only need say stuff in it , to make things funny ( which makes it really cringey ) , they 're all poor , out of job , or have jobs in austria . 
  maribor is a shithole ( but i think most people living there would agree ) . 
  prekmurje ( over mura region / eastern most part ) : they exist ? 
  their dialect is a separate language . 
  bela krajna ( white carniola / southern most part ) they 're croatians in disguise , also have wine , but it 's not as defining of them as for dolenjska , complain about the fence that 's being built on the border with croatia . 
  koro\u0161ka ( carinthia north-east region ) : the smallest region , has a really special way of talking , even more poor than \u0160tajerska , even more people go to work in austria , celovec and beljak are their rightful clay . 
  notranjska ( inner carniola / south western part ) : depression , cold , woods , bears and nothing much . 
  ju\u017ena primorska ( south littoral / western most south region ) : their dialect sounds sexy to a lot , probably that 's also why their women are regarded as the hottest , they 're men either sound gay or are `` latin lovers '' . 
  they 're all tanned , speak some italian and are in general most nationalistic / patriotic and at the same time also most generally left-leaning liberal people . 
  severna primorska ( north littoral / north westernmost region ) : we should probably stop calling it littoral , because they 're surrounded by mountains , and are quite far from sea in general , known for sheep , mountains and wwi ( which happened there ) , adrenaline junkies i guess ( or more accurately : catering to them ) . 
  suha krajna ( dry carniola ; our `` ghetto '' ) : as drunk as dolenjska , and mostly known for strange crime that happened there in the past . 
  they 're still pretty friendly ( unless you 're roma ) and will offer you wine , which is easier to find than water . 
  idrijsko-cerkljansko-rovtarsko ( middle of nowhere ) : they have really funny dialect , which in case of cerkno sounds really guttural to me , known for quicksilver mine , bears and being a catch-all phrase for middle of nowhere : rovte . 
  i put them together , because it 's hard to define where they each lie , they 're on the border of littoral , inner carniola and ljubljana `` sphere of influence '' , but different from all those . 
  ljubljana ( our capital ) : infested with hipsters , who all like to eat in the latest burger joint 's , which only use local ingredients , while drinking a micro-brewed beer and speak in a strange mix of slovenian and what seems like english , they ( we ) also think , they 're above everyone else . 
  i ate pb for breakfast for a long , long time . 
  i am kind of fan of it , but currently have n't eat it in a long time , because honey + butter is the real deal for breakfast . 
  also what barbarian would mix pb with `` jam '' ? 
  i mean why ? 
  especially because high-quality jam we have here is good on it 's own and just the energy intake of that mix feels crazy high . 
  given that our country is roughly the size of new jersey , i 'd say that one hand a lot , and on the other not nearly enough . 
  i 'm a cyclist , so i cycled through most of the country , but yet there are still `` blank spots '' on my map , where i 've rode pass , but never turned to explore that part . 
  but in general , i have all the major parts of the country covered .

  but he does seem to speak slovene well which is commendable ( obviously he would n't be in his position if he did n't ) . 
  a lot of foreigners here do n't . 
  i did n't realise you lived in slovenia and i really do n't think i 'm going to compare my knowledge of my native tongue to a foreigner . 
  i also do n't appreciate your snide remark towards what you call slovene culture . 
  you may be ahead of the many people here who do n't think twice about speaking serbo-croatian instead of slovene but really , that 's what should be expected of someone coming to our country . 
  that 's nice of you but it does n't make it any more likely that i will accept your definition of who a slovene is . 
  i 've always prefered czechia to the czech republic . 
  the republic part is just weird to me ; we do n't say slovene republic or german federal republic . 
  we call it \u010ce\u0161ka in slovene , too . 
   using a heuristic method to decide whether to speak slovenian or english with the different-looking , different-named or different-whatever person is , worst case , annoying to them , if they 're actually of the same nationality . 
  there are no black slovenes or slovenes named fikret so that 's quite doubtful . 
  this is n't america so you can tell when someone is n't originally from here . 
  and really , most people start with slovene but even those foreigners who have lived here for decades would n't reply in slovene . 
   using heuristic methods to determine any rights , privileges etc. 
  is simply * ism . 
  all citizens get the same rights by the way . 
   and thus my saying that there 's people out there , that look completely non-slovene and have totally non-slovene names and last names , but still speak and write better slovene than most slovenes , still know all the cultural norms as well as any slovene etc. 
  yeah , i 'd like to see that . 
  looks are literally the first thing anyone would go by . 
  of course , it 's harder when it comes to other europeans but that 's where different names and surnames as well as language in general come into play . 
  different ethnicity does n't necessarily mean only the way someone looks . 
  i do n't know where you 're from but where i come from most people have the common sense to be able to tell apart one of us from a foreigner . 
  ethnicity is one of the most important elements though , precisely because it 's something you 're born with . 
  it 's not just a question of culture but language , ethnicity and probably other factors as well . 
  if someone has a german father and a russian mother he is obviously half german half russian . 
  the fact that his ancestors lived in a region that changed rule many times does n't change that . 
  the us and most other american countries ( or possibly all of them , i 'm not sure ) give citizenship to anyone born there but most of the world gives citizenship only to children of their citizens . 
  i do n't really understand how our prime minister could represent a single voting district since parliamentary elections are organised across the country and for a parliament that represents the whole country . 
  if something 's true , why deny it ? 
   i 'm an american who 's never been to europe . 
  says enough . 
  many people say that they 're lazy and thieves because that 's what they are . 
  they live on other people 's land and then feel entitled to water and electricity and they do n't work ( and kick out any gypsy that does find a job ) . 
  they are provided with social support and could all live in normal houses but they would rather live in the middle of the woods . 
  their children run around without shoes and instead of sending them to school , the gypsies raise them to continue the life of crime and vagrancy . 
  but in the end , the holier-than-thou organisations like amnesty international paint gypsies as saints and everyone else a monster . 
  the stereotype of gypsies stealing children and metals ( cooper ) would n't exist if there was n't truth in it . 
  in illegal gypsy settlements , medics only go in with police support and the police do n't act againt gypsy crimes as much as they would against any other crime . 
  i do n't see why i would argue against gypsies being viewed the way they are when there 's every reason to do so . 
  not really . 
  romas and sints are gypsies but some random hobo is not . 
  lol , i thought this cultural appropriation nonsense was an american thing . 
  sami are probably the last europeans i 'd imagine complaining about it . 
  usually , people grow different sorts of flowers and vegetables . 
  in the cities where people do n't have gardens , many own small plots of land outside the city to grow vegetables there . 
  unfortunately not . 
  i have held a few before but i 've only ever shot an air gun . 
  another marriage-related tradition is [ vomnsk poh ] ( http://www.lompodstorzicem.si/turizem/lomski-ploh/ ) ( lomski ploh for the uninitiated ) . 
  in the village of lom , after pust , the unmarried men chop down a spruce tree and drag it through the village as a way to tease women who have n't found a husband yet . 
  they drag the tree to tr\u017ei\u010d where they cut it up and sell it . 
  this is askeurope , not americanshitposting . 
  would the will of the european commission or the will of the european central bank sound better ? 
  this is even weirder tbh . 
  with that additional pa , it does n't roll off the tongue nicely to me . 
  never seen one ( except invalid toilets , i suppose ) . 
  the only unisex toilet i can think of is the outdoors . 
  north of kranj , far enough to not be affected with the kamen-papir-\u0161karje plague, 
  we always just said kamen \u0161karje papir , shaking the fist on kamen and \u0161karje and then opening it on papir . 
  i thought the rock-paper-scissors setup was weird but this is straight heresy . 
  jokes aside , they stressed papir normally ( do n't think anyone says papir in good old upper carniola ) . 
  they may say it in the wrong order but i do n't see how that would be hard to say out loud . 
  i was also taught rock-scissors-paper but some weirdos in high school used rock-paper-scissors . 
  it just does n't roll off the tongue the same way and it 's wrong , honestly . 
  in [ slovenia ] ( http://eucbeniki.sio.si/admin/documents/learning_unit/2028/0403_sr_1410260967/0403_slovenija_oblike_varovanja_narave.jpg ) , we have several types of protected areas , the main three being the national park ( we have one , the triglav national park ) , the regional parks ( 3 ) and landscape parks ( 40 ) . 
  never heard of them being here . 
  we have a few mormons and those jehova people and i may have seen one or two hare krishna people as well . 
  i 've only heard a few instances of americans speaking slovene ( or at least a few words and sentences ) and it did n't sound very nice to my ear . 
  once i heard a chinese man speaking slovene on the television and his accent sounded quite interesting . 
  other than that , i ca n't say any immigrant 's accent ever sounded okay . 
  i do n't think there ever was considering slovenes fought for foreign rulers for such a long time . 
  i guess you could say the partisans were and still are viewed a bit differently but i do n't know if that counts . 
  i suppose you mean multiculturalism in the anti-european sense ( the sort of `` diversity '' talk you see on this website as well ) because europe already is home to many different cultures , languages , traditions , ... 
  these native cultures should definitely survive . 
  something i used to get tricked with by my uncle when i was a kid . 
  basically , this is a colloquial way to ask someone `` do you eat or drink ? 
  '' , but the trick is `` raj\u017e '' is a colloquial way of saying rice so the question is really `` do you eat rice or drink it ? '', 
  it was built some time in the 1920s so it 's almost a hundred years old . 
  nobody in our country squats unless it 's someone in the middle of the woods defecating . 
  the slovene equivalent of chavs ( we call them \u010defurji - certain thuggish characters , children of ex-yu immigrants ) do n't do that , either . 
  i 've been in croatia , bosnia , serbia and montenegro and i did n't see anyone doing it , either . 
  why would you be concerned , are you afraid of a eu invasion on usa ? 
  anyway , i can tell you that slovenia probably wo n't be spending that much more on its army ( of ~ 7000 soldiers ) . 
  as far as i know , the whole eu could go into north korea-style militarisation and we 'd still spend far less than the us on military . 
   but in / r/slavs _ squatting everybody is very fraternal i do n't know where that tired old meme came from - maybe russia - but i 've never ever seen anyone doing that here . 
  not in slovenia , although i have read some leftist radicals on the internet writing ridiculous things about slavery and colonialism - it does n't apply to us , though , since it was really our ancestors that were victims of that during the times of turkish invasions . 
  i do n't think that 's a political belief that they 'll be able to force onto our society . 
  it is when people put foreigners before their own . 
  i ca n't really think of a good explanation for that . 
  i suppose it makes them feel better about themselves as it feeds their xenophilia . 
  jesus , the questions here are getting more ridiculous every day . 
  i heard barron - her and donald 's son - speaks slovene , though . 
  it 's mostly because of all the bad things associated with hillary , trump 's policy on illegals and his anti-establishment vibe . 
  and i guess people are sympathetic because of his wife to a small degree . 
  most of the people i talked to about the elections thought it was the right choice . 
  i do n't know how americans look at somalia but i presume a place like detroit or chicago is still a lot safer than somalia . 
  i 'm sure there far less chance of any trouble than if hillary was elected . 
  i doubt trump will support terrorists . 
  slovene ( upper carniolan and colloquial slovene ) . 
  we learned english and german in school , if that counts . 
  okay i get it .

  croatia have started to drive unannounced buses toward the slovenian border . 
  300 refugees were bused to the green border and illegaly crossed , they weathered in a tent on a football field . 
  a new train is expected and slovenian authorities worry the train will be evacuated in croatia and refugees herded toward closed border crossing , with refugees still caught in the no-man 's - zone with slovenian border police not letting them enter and croatians blocking the way back . 
  as of 12.00 2700 refugees crossed into slovenia . 
  * [ minister of the interior vesna gy\u00f6rk\u00f6s \u017dnidar ] ( http://www.delo.si/novice/politika/gyorkos-znidarjeva-kje-je-24-000-kapacitet-s-katerimi-so-se-hvalili-na-hrvaskem.html ) * said that austrian capacity are curently full and slovenia can not accept more refugees . 
  because of that we can not be sure how many more refugees are headed our way . 
  it is a fact that slovenia can not handle the increased flow of refugees . 
  i have to ask myself where is the 24.000 lodging capacity croatia boasted with or if they 've stepped into a role of a carrier . 
  she added that no matter what help to children and women wo n't be denied . 
  during the day we will try to reach cooperation with croatia , otherwise things might get complicated . 
  he supports closing borders . 
  the cabinet is vary of germany closing it 's border in which case it is a realistic chance that slovenia will be saddled with more refugees than indicated by quotas . 
  ] `` given the circumstances we will increase our border control with police and logistic support of the army where needed . 
  this includes technical measures . 
  he does n't believe germany will close it 's borders . 
  in his opinion slovenia should take all measures to keep the flow of refugees below the level that would cause internal unrest . 
   here you are that 's an awful site tough , based entirely on self reporting and some dubious choices for life expenses . 
  my thoughts exactly ... 
  maybe , * maybe * that means that for that particular industry it 's actually better for them to be combined . 
  to be fair the kurds should have a country to call their own . 
  literally the only thing i know about swiss political parties is that [ apparently svp are fond of sheep ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01752/picture-2_1752355c.jpg ) . 
  how much power does a region a a collective have ? 
  i really , really hope so ... 
  but lets face it when europeans go far right we go right into the terrifying territory . 
  as of now there are 2372 refugees staying overnight in temporary centres and the border police say they 've closed the border for the night ( refusing to accept late evening buses ) . 
  four afghans applied for asylum . 
  the weather was awful this week , raining non-stop except for today and yesterday afternoon . 
  but there 's more rain forecast for tomorrow and a yellow alert . 
  it 's getting cold * and * wet . 
  sleeping under the sky is n't an option anymore . 
  in my experience were xenophobic because people do n't move around much . 
  we tend to put down roots for the long haul . 
  for instance my family has lived in the same area since the 13th century and the same goes for most of our neighbors . 
  mother of my grandparent 's friends moved from the next valley and everybody knew she was n't really * really * `` ours '' . 
  this has changed in the last 15 years or so , but people outside of city know `` everybody '' living close and their aunt in australia/germany/argentina . 
  call your great aunt if her friend 's niece 's husband 's brother can come over to have a look . 
  foreigners stick out like sore thumbs with no connections and it takes a couple of months for people to slowly warm up . 
  [ delo : slovenia rejected the additional train with 1800 refugees this afternoon ] ( http://www.delo.si/novice/slovenija/prebezniki-begunski-val-slovenske-meje.html ) * until 14.00 1700 refugees left lodging centre \u0160entilj for austria with 200 waiting . 
  unofficially salzburg lodging centre is already full . 
  * four afghan citizens have asked for asylum . 
  * the majority of refugees crossing are citizens of syria , afghanistan and iraq . 
  * as of 12:45 1200 people arrived by a scheduled train ( sredi\u0161\u010de ob dravi ) and 600 by buses ( peti\u0161ovci , gru\u0161kovje ) . 
  six buses were announced for 17:00 at obre\u017eje border crossing by the croatian police . 
  edit : link, 
  * live : bo\u0161tjan \u0160efic , state secretary of mnz ( ministry of the interior ) : in the afternoon we are expecting additional 300 refugees at the obre\u017eje border crossing . 
  croatia would like for slovenia to accept 5000 refugees daily . 
  but we have austria on the other side that does not want to accept more than 1500 people daily secretary \u0160efic explains . 
  we can not afford to accept more than we pass on , because this would mean that there would be 35.000 refugees in slovenia in ten days and that '' would be unacceptable '' . 
  nonetheless slovenia is prepared for such an eventuality \u0160efic assures . 
  while the majority of the migrant leave the accommodation centre in \u0160entilj soon after arriving , three afghan citizens have applied for asylum sta reports . 
  \u0160efic : we have to respect the fact that the target countries - sweden , germany and austria - have started to limit or will start to limit the number of refugees they accept . 
  we have rejected an agreement to accepting an additional train with 1800 migrants . 
  until now four refugees have applied for asylum . 
  in a press conference bo\u0161tjan \u0160efic , state secretary - mjz : we 've managed to tend to all refugees crossing into slovenia . 
  the majority of refugees are citizens of syria , afghanistan and iraq . 
  as far as i 'm aware the only disclosable non anonymised information falls under infectious diseases where the center for disease control has to be involved due to large-scale public endangerment . 
  oh , ok . around here everybody keeps to the rifles . 
  the spirit of biathlon is strong with us . 
  yeah ... but what do the handgun laws have to do with it ? 
  also it 's harder to share with a stranger when you do n't have much . 
  i suppose the correct term would be asylum seekers , their refugee status to be confirmed . 
  at least the rivers are cooperating . 
  as of 19:30 the train traffic with croatia has been stopped . 
  lets just hope refugees do n't try to cross the rivers on their own because of the recent rainfall . 
  later on the croatian foreign minister has explained for htv that after the closure of the hungarian border slovenia becomes the only viable alternative for [ the refugees ] to go west . 
  she assured that croatia will talk with slovenia on the number of refugees that can be taken in . 
  pusi\u0107 has also confirmed that plan c is n't croat-slovene , but is in fact croatian . 
  she did n't put forward any details of the plan . 
  under government instruction the slovenian railroads have closed all train traffic with croatia at 19:30 . 
  the same measure was implemented at the last surge of refugees . 
  the tough process of horny teenagers . 
  after raptors ( and corvids to an extent ) got protected status pidgeon numbers started to go down quickly . 
  now i have crows , ravens and kestrel dominating airspace outside my window . 
  oh , and young owls are the worst when you try to sleep . 
  but it 's not a mere hat , it is a ^ fe ^ do ^ raaaaaaa, 
  bigotry in itself is very inclusive . 
  no matter your background or situation you can fall into it 's grip . 
  but , yeah . 
  this is n't racism . 
  it 's bigotry , might be xenophobia of the islamic flavor . 
  the article is behind paywall :(, 
  aaaand our posts have special departments dedicated to rerouting international mail . 
  uh ... by that point i 've given up on waiting on translators and ( my mom ) bought the books in english on the day of international release . 
  i know that in the movies they 've ( sometimes/sometimes not ) kept the original names and just made some sort of explanation in the subtitles along the translation . 
  looked it up : mark neelstin  mrlakenstein, 
  tell me about it . 
  in my generation of medical school less than 15 % of enrolled students were male . 
  our lab group of 10 had 3 guys and we were standing out to the point that assistants made comments on it . 
  so sad . 
  on a good note , male medical technicians ( unisex nurse title ) are becoming more common . 
  this reminds me of an old joke ... an albanian is buying an apartment from a serb in belgrade . 
  they agree on 20k marks . 
  the albanian ask : '' sooo where are you moving to now ? '' the serb says : '' zagreb . '' albanian : '' you know what ... let me give you 30k and you buy an apartment in ljubljana , so you wo n't have to move twice in five years . '', 
  yeah ...  but vjekoslava amerl sakic , a doctor specialising in family medicine , told croatian newspaper 24 sata that `` up to four months could pass before the first marijuana-based products are available to patients '' . 
   she explained that the ministry will decide which specific medicines are allowed `` only when the first [ thc-based ] substance is imported and when our [ croatian health service ] laboratories process it '' . 
   she said that doctors also need to evaluate all the possible side-effects , dosages and conditions of use for thc products , which can only come after the lab research . 
  ... this will take a while . 
  with autocorrect screaming at you all the way ... 
  at least you get to express your romantic side < 3, 
  try the slavic countries .

  eh ... why ? 
  it 's a commodity . 
  nah , it just reinforces the fact that i 'm being a massive ponce . 
  slovenian political space is independent from how i 'm acting on here . 
  fortunately , i might add , that 'd be too much responsibility for me . 
  mladina is a tabloid , not a newspaper . 
  but , well , at least we have demokracija and reporter , too . 
  i guess you also miss slivnik on top of delo . 
  oh , also , you 're both wrong and a bigoted asshole . 
  maybe it will stop , if you say pretty please with a cherry on top ? 
  i mean , multiculturalism is kind of a side effect of globalization , after all . 
  we ca n't have a truly globalized world if people ca n't move around globally . 
  of course he 'd say that . 
  they are quite nimby-ish , are n't they ... 
  are you asking me to prove a negative ? 
  well , it all depends on who 's the current editor-in-chief , was rightist yesterday , is leftist today , and who knows what it will be like tomorrow . 
  i rarely read it . 
  but i would be pleased if you stopped assuming `` slovenian left '' = `` has their heads up putin 's ass '' ; because you 'd be both wrong , and a bigoted asshole for doing so , 
  european nations tend to be quite fierce and often at odds . 
  as history shows . 
  in fact , the eu was designed in order to prevent future wars in europe . 
  that was its initial purpose , and still is . 
  of course russia would get mangled , worse than we would , they do every now and then , anyway . 
  i 'm only talking about the west , and that there 's going to be some serious cost/benefit analysis . 
  or swiss . 
  actually , i think swiss would be more likely . 
  france : `` okay , we 'll arrange for armed escorts , but you have join the euro . '', 
  oh , for the love of ... how about we just ... 1 ) nuke the entire project 2 ) have another one of those lovely world wars and kill off 10 % - 20 % of ourselves ( i volunteer to be one of the killed ones ) 3 ) spend another two decades just rebuilding . 
  4 ) fresh start on european integration 5 ) if it fails again , go to 1 ), 
  maybe the revolution never really ended ... 
  well it 'd be still interesting to see a projection of eu export growth without the sanctions . 
  weekends and vacations are counted in to i believe . 
  the problem is , and people simply fail to understand it , that what makes sense economically and what makes sense politically are often very different things . 
  and that most politicians , including german and italian ones , will nuke a sound economic long-term plan from orbit in order to preserve their votes in the short term . 
  same could be said for latin cultures . 
  guess you 're going to make me look it up , then . 
  i 'm a-gonna look for about thirty-seven pictures telling me about my butthurt . 
  this might take a while . 
  how about you link me the whole gallery , and i promise i will look through it , one by one , in 5 minute intervals ? 
  you really should work on making your stuff more efficient , automate it . 
  yes , yes , i know you think i am stupid and need to be told everything twice , but why are you putting up the show twice for all these people you 're trying to impress ? 
  do you think they 're stupid , too ? 
  let me worry about my butt . 
  it 's mine , after all , you need n't concern yourself with it . 
  but , well , the irony in this one , strong is . 
  it 's not , really . 
  but it will have the unfortunate consequence of creating prejudice . 
  that 's because human beings tend to think that anyone who consistently disagrees with them is a piece of shit . 
  sure you can . 
  you 'd be an asshole to do it , but that 's how most prejudices * work * . 
  yeah , so ? 
  what are you going to do ? 
  tell mom ? 
  yeah , so ? 
  had i thought you were arguing in good faith , i 'd have refrained from that . 
  but we both know you were n't . 
  the moment you started using phrases like `` calling your bullshit '' . 
  see , that phrase is used by people who are merely interested in asserting dominance , as opposed to bringing new information to the table . 
  you just wanted to throw a punch and act as if you `` won '' . 
  and i * despise * that , so i 'm fighting dirty now . 
  ca n't handle it , hotshot ? 
  you going to tell me i 'm a waste of your time and not worth your attention ? 
  going to put on some sunglasses and walk away in slow-mo like a cool guy walking from an explosion ? 
  ( note : that tends to sound more like `` well fine i 'm going home , and i 'm taking the ball , too ! '' ), 
  you were looking for a cheap fix of internet power and glory . 
  and i have nothing useful to do with my life , so i 'm going out of my way to mess with you , because you 're a bit obnoxious . 
  ( ps : anyone who wants to mess with me because i 'm obnoxious is free to try . ), 
  i think it was more a statement against `` moral high horses '' than anything else . 
  eh ... you do realize that acceptance of homosexuality is a very recent thing , yes ? 
  but on a more serious note , it usually tends to depend on where the church is strong . 
  why not ? 
  because of ukraine ? 
  remind me since when fifa was an organization supposed to enforce western foreign policy ? 
  in practical terms , if it 's not enforced , then it does n't exist . 
  if theft was only technically illegal but authorities would n't bother to persecute , you think people would consider theft actually to be illegal ? 
  oooooh , this is some dominant alpha behavior you 're exhibiting there , you manly hunk , you . 
  * consider me seduced * my place or yours ? 
  i mean this is what it 's about to you , right ? 
  asserting dominance . 
  proving you 're the alpha around here ? 
  and since i do n't actually have anything you could take , i can only assume you 're doing it because you want to impress me and get in my pants . 
  how did it feel when you hit that downvote button ? 
  did your hand stray into your pants to your erection ? 
  did you splurge all over your keyboard ? 
  were you all like `` everyone see that !? 
  see how i owned that guy , am i a stud , or what ? '', 
  i 'd bet money that 's exactly what happened , hotshot . 
  yeah , i 'm mocking you . 
  such a sad sight --, 
  i 'm saying that when you need to take a shit you go find a private place . 
  not really . 
  if i want to show `` they banned them all '' is wrong , i only need to find one that was n't banned . 
  i just find it funny how it 's always the radical groups that call themselves something like `` freedom '' or `` dawn '' or `` something else pleasant-sounding '' , really . 
  well , there 's also a matter of enforcing it on someone who can mangle you pretty badly even if you manage to subdue them . 
  the only rating company free of geopolitical risks would be one not based or having any economic interests in earth . 
  i 've been pondering it for a while . 
  and sure , learning the language is something i take as a necessity . 
  if you asked me if i meant to learn the language i 'd be like `` why are you asking , i thought that 's a given ? '', 
  as long as the `` beer '' in your name is n't bud or something . 
  but you ca n't ban `` freedom '' !,

  my family loves picking blueberryies . 
  they pick buckets of them every picking season . 
  i do n't mind . 
  blueberrys with sugar on top , delicious !, 
  it 's also a good brain food . 
  very , very , very . 
  there 's not enough very 's . 
  at least in the part where i live where we have abundance of mushrooms . 
  we do n't look for our cultural identity in serbia . 
  it was brought here during yugoslavia . 
  we have plenty of serbian and bosnian immigrants here that brought it here and still practice it . 
  it 's like saying britain looks for cultural identity in india and pakistan because imigrants from over there brought their culture with them . 
  we have our own culture that is vastly different from serbian one . 
  there is no wall between slovenia and italy . 
  western part of slovenia took quite a lot of italian culture as it was part of it for quite some time . 
  you could say the same about parts of northern italy and southern italy . 
  the culture in those two is different . 
  there 's also doughnuts covered in chocolate filled with vanilla . 
  those are n't good . 
  and trojane also has a blueberry filling . 
  i think . 
  where do you think the name comes from ? 
  rex was a dog from an austrian tv show . 
  everyone and their mother once had a dog named rex . 
  kung fu panda was great . 
  that 's also one of the rares ones i watched dubbed . 
  i did n't know that many countries dubbed . 
  horror !, 
  definitely subtitles . 
  only kids animated movies get dubbed . 
  not your english !, 
  english of spanish people in general lol . 
  your english does sound like you have a speech impediment . 
  is n't there a movement in trieste to gain independence ? 
  i do n't expect any country to be a shithole like some do . 
  i watch youtube videos , i read articles online , i know that even places like grozny are made to look nice . 
  why would it be boring ? 
  it does n't mean i do n't enjoy a country i visit , it just means that i know what to expect before i go . 
  i 'm not one of those who visits a country they just heard of and does n't learn about it on the internet . 
  i 'm also never disappointed by a country . 
  18.000 orphans or 18.000 kids in state care ? 
  i believe it 's the latter . 
  none . 
  i do n't underestimate countries and i come prepared . 
  we do n't have much orphans here . 
  those that by some unfortunate events become orphaned usually go to relatives or they are put up for adoption . 
  there were 9 adopted kids last year , 15 adopted by one of their parents partner and 11 adopted from abroad . 
  there are far more people ( around 600 ) on a waiting list to adopt , than there are kids to adopt . 
  ** edit ** : we have 3 youth homes ( [ 1 ] ( http://www.mladinski-dom-mb.si/ ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.mdj.si/ ) , [ 3 ] ( http://www.malci-beliceve.si/ ) ) for kids who temporarily ca n't live with their parents ( parents incapable to provide for their kids , destructive family , educational carelesness , alcohol abuse in family , sexual abuse or suspicion of it , running away from home , learning difficulties , housing problems , neglection , hospitalization of a parent/parents , etc ) . 
  these homes work based on a `` family education model '' . 
  kids are divided into heterogenous groups of max . 
  10 , mixed by gender , age , complexity , interests . 
  each group has 2 , sometimes 4 `` group parents '' . 
  all of the groups are autonomous and have their own rules . 
  in one of the youth homes , each group lives in a seperate apartment but they all live in the same building . 
  in other 2 youth homes , each group lives in their own house . 
  they live as they were a family . 
  kids go to different local schools , except in one home , where they have an internal school that can be visited by kids from outside the home as well . 
  capacity of all three youth homes combined is 122 . 
  all of the homes are for kids up to age 18 , but they provide facilities ( apartments ) for late teens as well . 
  we also have around 700 care families that take care of around 1000 kids . 
  reasons for a child to be put up in a care family are same as with youth homes . 
  ** edit 2 ** : i think eu is in the process of deinstitualization , which means providing help to families before they reach the critical point and placing as much kids in foster care or a similar programe as possible . 
  no , you 're # 2 , we 're # 10 ( 2013 world data ) , which is still good imo , considering the opt-in system . 
  we 're # 1 in heart transplant by a long shot . 
   ** language ** , culture and history are three things that connect people . 
  do n't you agree ? 
  no i do n't . 
  language connects you to your own nation , not to other countries . 
   this is a weird question . 
  do you feel more connected to germanic speaking countries just because you speak a germanic language ? 
  do you have exchanges with germanic countries just because they 're germanic ? 
  this was my original comment . 
  i still do n't know what you 're trying to prove here if you agree that language group is not something that connects people but culture and history does . 
  we have an opt-in system . 
  people are againts opt-out because of lunatics who spread conspiracy theories . 
  [ slovenia is a democratic republic ] ( http://www.us-rs.si/en/about-the-court/legal-basis/ ), 
  first you say you feel more connected to germanic language group , then you say you do n't feel as connected to switzerland than to finland which does not speak a germanic language . 
  so it 's not language that connects you but history , relations and proximity . 
  that 's the point . 
  someone from poland will definitely feel more connected to lithuania and germany than to for example fyrom . 
  logic . 
  at least 18 countries in europe have opt-out systems . 
  but they probably get stressed . 
  it 's not a nice thing using animals for entertainment of idiots . 
   places like private forests or the use the natural rescourses like forest berries by citizens is pretty restricted . 
  no not really . 
  image of yugoslavia was completely distorted in western media . 
  heck , most still believe we were part of ussr . 
   well ... yes ? 
  the langugae and culture are simliar compared to for instance polish . 
  talk is about language groups not geographic proximity to one another . 
  you 're just contradicting yourself now . 
  no poland . 
  you slavic , you must feel closer to russia . 
  exactly . 
  language has little to do with how much in common you have with someone . 
  it 's relations and history that counts , which is usually , but not always * connected with geographic proximity . 
  so you feel closer to someone in , for example , switzerland than to , let 's say , someone in finland , because they belong to the same language group ? 
  that 's just weird .

  especially with filip flisar and klemen kosi . 
  they think they 're funny ... lj dialect of young people is horrible with all the loan words and street lingo . 
  thankfully i only know normal lj people , with normal accent/dialect . 
  i do n't mind ljubljana accent at all . 
  i do n't like mb accent . 
  ick !, 
  slovenske konjice , \u0160entjur and area in between sounds ` hill-billysh ' . 
  primorska accent is the best one . 
  i think accent is just part of a dialect . 
  accent is intonation , the way you pronounce words , dialect is different words for same thing , different endings to words etc. 
  that 's called an accent . 
  no , i mean * accents * . 
  accent is part of a dialect . 
  when i speak literal slovene i have a different accent than someone from a different part of the country . 
  accent reffers to phonetics and phonology of speech ( sounds , pronounciation , ... ) , dialect is an entire system . 
  in the us , for example sounthern accent is an * accent * not a dialect . 
  there 's also [ natura 2000 ] ( http://www.natura2000.si/index.php?id=45&amp;l=1 ) protected areas . 
  same language can have multiple accents . 
  google says it 's been present since 1995 and they have around 100 members , 30 of whom are active . 
  but what 's the difference with any other poster , let 's say a living room poster ? 
  no , and i personaly think it 's silly the way us worships them . 
  pizza of course . 
  tons of food that 's so common we do n't consider it foreign anymore . 
  yep , it means the same here . 
  my favourite is [ this ] ( http://www.gorenjka.si/en/category/rice-chocolates/ ) bali rice chocolate ( i did not know it 's called mamm in english ) . 
  i recommend it if you can get it somewhere . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.mojacokolada.si/ ) a store with mostly slovene boutique chocolates . 
  idk if they 're any good . 
  i hear berryshka is good . 
  where do they steal it from ? 
  we once bought a whole suitcase of cheap knives , spoons , steak knives etc for 15 $ , it was new . 
  they said that we 'd pay more than 200 $ if we bought the same thing in the store . 
  of course we knew it was cheap stuff . 
  the funny thing is , they came in a car wit hungarian licence plates but they communicated in one of the scb languages . 
  do they give out cards saying they 're deaf and they 're collecting money for their association ? 
  we have plenty of non-slovene gypsies doing the same thing here . 
  ours are too lazy . 
  they give out cards saying they 're deaf or somethig similar , they demand a signature and then money . 
  or they just kneel infront of the store begging , some pretend they have no legs . 
  there has been plenty of talk about this things in recent years because most of them belong to arganised groups and all the money they get from people is taken away by the leader of their group . 
  there are also cars with hungarian licence plates ( they may not be hungarian gypsies ) driving around the countryside selling stuff . 
  like pillows , knives , drills etc. 
  they usually target old people because old people are naive . 
  * every now and then we get stuff in news about few of them being expelled from the country for aggressive begging . 
  i was interested more about why is the government doing nothing about the problem . 
  what about race dogs like galgos , lurchers , podencos and greyhounds ? 
  is there anything being done about them ? 
  we have a few associations that bring them here from spain and ireland and i was shocked reading stories about them . 
  i love graz . 
  i tell everyone to visit it . 
  basic treatment is included yes . 
  although you have to pay for white fillings , amalgam fillings are free . 
  white fillings are free for visible teeth in front . 
  edit : braces and cleaning for minors are free . 
  latvia ai n't good at all . 
  they 're 35th on fiba world ranking . 
  renault clio is without a doubt most popular car here . 
  especially for young drivers as a 1st car . 
  slovenian ** car of the year ** 2016 was opel astra , followed by \u0160koda superb , mazda cx-3 , audi a4 and renault kadjar ( in that order ) . 
  ** most registered new car brands ** were , in order , vokswagen , renault , \u0160koda , opel and ford . 
  ** best selling car moderls ** were renault clio , vw golf , vw polo , \u0160koda octavia and \u0160koda fabia . 
  ** best selling small cars ** were renault clio , vw polo , \u0160koda fabia , opel corsa and peugeot 208 . 
  ** best selling upper middle class cars ** were vw passat , opel insignia , bmw 3 series , \u0160koda superb and audi a4/s4 . 
  ** best selling upper class cars ** were bmw 5 series , audi a6/s6 , mercedes e , bmw 6 series and mercedes cls . 
  ** bestselling minivans ** were wv golf sportsvan , citroen berlingo , renault scenic , opel meriva and ford b-max . 
  ** best selling suv 's and crossovers ** were nissan juke , dacia duster , renault captur , nissan quashqai and peugeot 2008 . 
   the serbian government and the romanian government neither of them are in schengen . 
  they only need to protect their border . 
  hungary has to protect others as well . 
   not only that , but it is n't individuals , like me and you . 
  it was several eu leaders . 
  from merkel to luxembourg 's fm . 
  until there 's a law prohibiting fences , they 're individual opinions . 
   let 's be honest and realize that orban is a populist . 
  he 's a rusophile and has a bad influence on hungary . 
  neither mine nor your opion metters . 
  it 's on hungarians to decide who 's ` best ' for their country . 
  there is no law against any fences . 
  what some individuals think does n't metter . 
  every country has the right to protect their borders . 
  and schengen countries have a duty to protect other countries . 
  is there a reason why you keep mentioning western europe and not eastern europe ? 
  24th is still a working day here , so we set up a christmas tree in the afternoon , make dinner , eat a lot , watch tv and open presents . 
  we do n't do anything special on christmas day excpet for visiting family . 
  i have never heard of christmas wheat and none of the holy evenings and i was raised catholic . 
  not very active though . 
  wow , now it 's clear you have some major issues . 
  you have problems . 
  serious problems . 
  so you think the only buildings we have are dwellings ? 
  you 're embarassing yourself . 
  we also have dunaj ( vienna ) , majland ( mailand is german for milano ) , bene\u010dija ( veneto ) . 
  that was n't the question . 
  i wonder why not haha, 
  i know pretty damn well , i do n't need to google definitions . 
  either you did n't read the title , or you do n't know what a dwelling is . 
  uh , no ? 
  majority ? 
  why would majority buildings be communist buildings ? 
  world did n't start after ww1 .

now now , do n't change the rules honey , you first said with useles answers . 
  my answers are far from useles . 
  stop moving the goal posat and deal with the truth . 
   laibach are a bunch of nazis, 
  yes they are . 
  they are of the kavkasian race . 
   why is the hate directed towards roma so widespread and tolerated in europe ? 
  because they come onto some feeld of yours , settle there and wont leave and you cant evict them . 
  than 5 years later they will start conplaining how poor they are and how they have no utility infrastructure in their ilegal setelment . 
   to me , the roma struggle seems very similar to the black struggle in america how so ? 
   comments are so full of full on racism discriminating on national basis is called nationalism . 
  gypsies are white , an indoeuropean nation in fact . 
   very recently enslaved , noone enslaved them . 
  in fact in the time of feudalism when the ordenary pesant was bound to the land , the roamed europe free . 
   that they steal the do . 
  the come to your house ant tare of copper dranage pipes . 
  they steal manhole covers . 
  they even steal paper from paper recicling bins . 
   however the european racism again , not racism since they are the same race . 
  we could just arm the kurds , they have shown to be a formidible fighting force . 
  inforce a tanpone zone on the egean coast and around bospores . 
  build a border wall ( good oportunety to anex trakia btw ) and wait it out . 
  russians just inforced humanitarian coridors for evacuation . 
  but some terrorists are still lingering . 
  its strange , because i intentionaly watch 2 news sources , slovenias news has up to now beeen wery anti asad , and still is they depict the lawfull army of the syrian state as the bad guys and the islamists as the good guys . 
  while if you watch serbian media the reporting is much more neutral . 
  for example , with the same information available from their croatian colegue on the ground and other international sources serbian state news chose to air this `` the syrian army is seen hepling a lot of the civilians evacuating '' while slovenin media chose not to air it . 
  neither did they show the russian army pres conference . 
  i do n't care much for it , but nontheles in my opinion it is austrian . 
  seems like a praier we can get behind . 
   it creates a very `` you do n't believe the right way '' feeling . 
  whell they do n't ... 
  here is a quick are you a christian test : * do you believe in the father , the son and the holy spitit ? 
  * do you believe in the reserection of lasares ? 
  * who created our world ? 
  ansers : yes , yes , god atheist test : * do you believe in any diety ? 
  answers : no . 
   but if you choose not to believe , then you also have to go all the way . 
  i 'm surprized to hear this from a protestant land . 
  even chatolics are n't like that . 
  an atheist is someone simply not believing in jahve/svarun/thor / spagety monster ... why would n't you celebrate interesting cultular celebrations like christmas ? 
   not in denmark . 
  we have christianised it all . 
  we once had a king called frederik . 
  we actually have had a bunch of them , and this guy was the 4th . 
  he gave fastelavn ( carneval ) a religious meaning , summer solstice became sankt hans ( st. johns ) , etc. 
  could n't the same proces aply now to give them a secular meaning ? 
   i actually do n't know why we celebrate it on the 24th . 
  historycaly churche clerics cant agree weather he was born before or after midnight . 
  it is typical for nordic countries to celebrate christmas on the 24th  ai n't that just a tad degrading ? 
  or is that just me ? 
  why do you consider it degrading ? 
   so it would make no sense to celebrate them , would it ? 
  not realy , it would stil make conplet sense for an atheist to go to a christmas party . 
  because why not , we celebrate `` pust '' ( carneval ) wich is a pegan ritual , we celebrate summer solstic a nother pegan celebration . 
  and noone nowerdays believes in perun , svarun , \u017diva , vesna , ect . 
  16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 = christmas . 
  everyone knows that . 
  christmas is on the 25th not 24th . 
  your nordic ways are outdated . 
   ai n't that just a tad degrading ? 
  or is that just me ? 
  why do you consider it degrading ? 
   so it would make no sense to celebrate them , would it ? 
  not realy , it would stil make conplet sense for an atheist to go to a christmas party . 
  because why not , we celebrate `` pust '' ( carneval ) wich is a pegan ritual , we celebrate summer solstic a nother pegan celebration . 
  and noone nowerdays believes in perun , svarun , \u017diva , vesna , ect . 
  * 10 days  st. johns day why is this a big holiday in denmark ? 
   what do you think about this term ? 
  i think its a cheep way to artifitialy inflate the number of religious people . 
   is it a term that is also used in your country ? 
  i have heard the term `` people who believe they believe '' used, 
  standard ? 
  res tako misli\u0161 ? 
  sure what ? 
  interesantno, 
  you have made a mortal enemy * italian * pfe, 
  in to v stalnem dotoku . 
  itd itd, 
  slovene comandments : kill thau neighbour . 
  wishs to yourself misfortune as long as your neighbours misfortune is for that price greater . 
  remember the sabbath day by working loudly in the jard . 
  you shall murder the commies/nazies you shall give false testimony against your neighbor to gain land and influance . 
  you shall covet your neighbor 's house . 
  you shall covet your neighbor 's wife , or his male or female servant , his ox or donkey , or anything else that belongs to your neighbor . 
   you mean like slovenia made somekind of terrorist act on yugoslavia , what are you talking about ? 
  slovenia is a country not a militia, 
  ok how muxh has the pension risen in the past decade ? 
  usnje vrhnika was high qualety leder , we once exported . 
  we once produced military and engerering grade explosives sold to even the usa , the optics we produced surpased the world famous russian military optics . 
  and our bateries were used in military submarines how is this subpar shit ? 
  lets hope they do n't try and make us go there , cuz sory but i will not answer . 
  tho i do believe a peceful reanexation is in order . 
   our industry was old and very polluting we used to produse our own explosives , our own leder , our own automobiles , our own trains ... where is this now ? 
  is this not true ? 
  show me when have i advocated conspiracies . 
  kosovo & metohia might not be as welcoming ( but that is due to the large albanian population ) as other places , [ but in general serbs are the most welcoming people ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucg3ghrcu2wivesotgcxygjg ), 
  and someones bright idea was to leave that market and ruin our industy . 
   more choice and stable prices for consumers and citizens you mean how prices keep rising whilepensions stay the same ? 
  where have i spread conspiracy theories ?

  i still hide my kids , wives and husbands every time i see coldstream guards , because they wear red coats which is commonly associate with colonialism ( !! ), 
  so obviously they still have bloodlust for it . . 
  [ red star ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/mikoyan-gurevich_mig-35_maks%272007_pichugin.jpg ) is still fine though . 
  supposedly all such agreements are done like that and the reason is that it avoids pressure from corporations when the current proposals do n't grant them favors less that the amount maximally imaginable . 
  it confirms my current understanding . 
  i still do n't understand the outcry . 
  if you do n't like american produce then read the fucking label and do n't buy it , easy . 
  i have n't read on it . 
  is n't it supposed to remove some tariffs between the two markets ? 
  and if so not sure why people would oppose choice . 
  thanks < 3, 
  whoooosh, 
  i would n't leave a spaniard in waiting , you know how temperamental they are . 
  tell him that also . 
   one could make the argument good thing that * one * died long ago then , but whatevs . 
  edit : meh , i fucking agree . . 
  they shoud 've gotten like a month of community work ( for hooliganism , not blasphemy , though i do n't think they were charged with that ) . 
  my comment was more in the line of ` if you go on mount everest , do n't complain about frostbite ' . . 
   pussy riot case ffs the group got exactly what they sought . 
  you should n't be allowed to do whatever the fuck you want , even for an artistic performance of dubious value . 
   i want to hire them . 
  which costs couple 100k per song . 
  you do n't have that kind of money to spend on individual songs . 
   because that is just information . 
  and those are just words . 
  everyone knows that every through or intellectual work is isomorphic to [ natural numbers ] ( g\u00f6del numbering ) - or information . 
  does n't mean that the same rules that apply to small numbers should necessarily apply to ones with much bigger entropy . 
   even if this means ip producers get a smaller guarantee that they will get compensated ( which i do n't think it will mean ) . 
  it 's my belief that when nobody has to pay anything to get a copy the potential producers would stop producing because they would know the significant investment needed would not be compensated later through licensing deals . 
   as long as the main system for funding is copyright , they are n't going to show their full potential . 
  it 's like saying ` as long as bourgeois are oppressing proletariat the full potential of communism will not be shown ' . 
  there are a lot of parallels between those two totalitarian groups , maybe we should explore them . 
  you have some vague ideas , some sudo-science , no idea if it would work out , and you 're ready to change the system , possibly plunging it into another 50 years of grayness . 
  i 'm sorry , but i come from a european country that was until 90 's ruled by communists , and i 'm very weary of anyone claiming to know solutions coming with poorly defined reasoning and wanting to change the entire system . 
   people are in the mindset of the copyright payment system , when we switch this will change . 
  and in the communal world where all property ( not just intellectual one ) was shared things just fell apart for some reason . 
  guess communists were one step ahead of file-sharing types . 
   sharing and incentive are n't mutually exclusive . 
  for exhibitionist youtube-type of feces creations - no , for multi-million dollar investment - yes . 
   for some reason this is the important part to everyone . 
  it should n't be . 
  our civil rights and the preserwation of these is the important part . 
  i do n't care . 
  you want people to share stuff , so you want to increase personal liberties while i care about economy more ( i would prefer if people suffer if only i could see humankind flying in spaceships in next 40 years ) . 
  guess we have different priorities . 
  it 's my opinion that the economy would decline if your ideas were implemented , it 's up to you to convince me that this is not the case . 
   i am 95 % convinced that legalising i 'm only interested in a formal proof , and not in the slightest in ` gut feelings ' . 
   instead of those facilitating and publishing and marketing and all that maybe marketing people are actually producing value because the internet nullified most of the value the original product . 
  that is , the original product ( songs ) does n't feed the authors anymore ( because of p2p ) , the main products has become marketing . 
   would result in more incentive ( because more money ) i do n't know where from . 
  walk me through it , seriously . 
  if all ip protections were abolished , why would masses want to pay for anything if they could get it for free . 
   but that would mean they start paying more , it would seem . 
  not everything can be pirated and there are certain types of conveniences and general ease of mind when buying things . 
  again your conjecture is rather hand-wavy . 
  pirates paying more is probably a result of pirates being more tech-savvy , so there 's a hidden variable here . 
  i still do n't see how less protection would lead to more spending . 
   most pirates are not cheap leeches . 
  a few pirates download everything and pay nothing . 
  i call leeching ( in the p2p/torrent context ) ` pirating pirates ' and do n't recognize any further harm than the original pirating has already accomplished . 
   but the only way that music will be created is if the creators get paid , they are going to pay . 
  things are n't willed into existence . 
   i really like game of thrones , and the worst thing about watching it is that there is no way of giving money to the creators . 
  they want me to get a subscription , or possibly buy dvds or other stupid things like that . 
  i just want to give the hard working people some money . 
  i agree that the current forms of * legal * media distribution are totally and comprehensively fucked up . 
   almost all of it , yes , but you still need to use your hands . 
  which is n't the bottleneck , the work is 95 % intellectual . 
   they get a lot of the money , but the work they are doing is not needed . 
  so you think that there is a worldwide conspiracy , probably enforced by governments ( how else would it work ? ), 
  that are thwarting free market economics , one of whose basic tenets is cutting costs / cutting out middle men ? 
  surely a conspiracy of ` rothschild ' proportions ? 
   no rights are natural . 
  thus you should agree that there 's no a priori overriding reasoning why your desire to not pay for someone else 's intellectual work should take precedence as a government given right over desires of authors of intellectual products to receive compensation for their work ? 
   so you pay for a copy . 
  no , you pay for a license . 
  always has been that way . 
  if you paid for a copy then you could freely resell copies of it . 
  you are licensed to consume ( play , watch , read , etc ) a copy of that work . 
   when file sharing is illegal our rights are being threatened . 
  you already admitted that there are no natural rights , thus you have only the rights governments granted you . 
  thus you are then forced to argue why it is fair/moral/good for you to have an overriding right of sharing ip over a right of ip producers to get compensation . 
   people spend money on kickstarter and flattr . 
  people spent jackshit on both of those and both of those have yet to come with with results that can compete with the conventional forms of financing . 
  furthermore a model that produced a few small successes should n't be applied to a multi-trillion dollar economy without rigorously studying it first . 
   sharing information is a great thing . 
  having no incentive to produce intellectual work is n't so great . 
  again it 's up to you to make a rigorous proof of why in the world in which there is no ip protection the production of new intellectual work would not decrease . 
   we know that works sorta . 
  the flagship of foss - linux is produced by corporations most of which sell products that are not opensource ( ibm - all of their hardware , google - web search engine is proprietary ) . 
  redhad is an exception , but that 's because linux is so convoluted it needs support , or in other words - they are not fixing the system because they have an agenda of selling you support services . 
  perhaps in the future we should refer to them as ` the so called pirate party ' or ` the `` pirate '' party ' to avoid the confusion . 
   programming is working with your hands . 
  most decidedly is not . 
  unless you count in that the menial work like web development . 
  programming is intellectual work , the keyboard is only a conduit through which we transfer that intellectual work . 
   actually working on the actual music and software receive a bigger part of the money unions are not illegal . 
   a method where we do n't lose our rights self-given and not natural . 
   we force everyone to pay if they want a copy you do n't pay for a copy , you pay for a right to play a copy . 
  it 's a form of contract much in the same way a car loan is a form of a contract .

  yeah that is true , but somehow `` launching all your nukes '' , or even `` all your operational nukes '' seems like a rather stupid strategic move , so i did n't think of that ... 
  i 'm not sure what russia 's benefit from occupying finland would be . 
  i mean . 
  as i said several times before , this is reality , not fiction . 
  there 's reasons for what russia 's doing , and those reasons are deeper than `` they 're just evil assholes '' . 
  oh you so silly . 
  those shields are totally not directed at russia , but at dangerous countries such as iran or unstable middle east countries where terrorists could get their hands on nukes !, 
  honest , cross my heart !, 
  that 's been our narrative regarding those missile shields since ... ever . 
  and it turns out , russia was right not to buy it . 
  ( still , yeah i hope we can get them in place soon . 
  would n't want any missiles flying over my head . ), 
  they do whenever the narrative that they do suits us . 
  like you know , `` all muslims are terrorists '' narrative that 's so prevalent . 
  sure , whatever you say , man . 
  yeah yeah , i 'll just smile and nod . 
  just ... smile and nod . 
  well , sweden did try to overthrow the government of israel according to netanyahu ... so maybe their historical neutrality indeed * is * just a clever ruse , and they played us all for fools !, 
  yeah , russia is very orthodox there . 
  pun intended . 
  but still ... it 's fifa . 
  and considering that with the olympics in russia last year went relatively smoothly on this front ( the diplomatic/political aspect notwithstanding , mind ) , i have no idea what fifa is getting at there . 
  you ... really do n't have a clue what you 're talking about , do you , 
  looks more like `` what americans think of europeans '' , to be honest ... 
  really ? 
  so , if all nato members that are not meeting the goal of 2 % defense spending abolished their armies and dropped their spending to 0 % right now , the situation would remain unchanged ? 
  in other words , if those that are `` not doing enough '' would instead actually start `` doing nothing '' , then it would all stay the same ? 
  it would not and you know it . 
  you know that the situation would get way worse . 
  so you also know you 're full of ( ideological ) shit . 
  on a more serious note , this happens because the european integration is slow . 
  if we had a fiscal union in place , you can bet we 'd have gotten to this point sooner . 
  to be completely honest the similarities between europe ( or certain european countries ) today and japan in 1990s are starting to worry me quite a bit . 
  so that usa has something to feel good about themselves for . 
  i was just making a joke , calm down . 
  thought the subreddit could use a chuckle . 
  i know what you mean , by the way . 
  even i get told that we had it great under ussr ... despite never having been a part of it in the first place !, 
  okay , forgive me if this is ignorant , but seeing as the relations between russia and poland are n't something to write home about , why would you want to maintain a diplomatic mission in russia in the first place ? 
  i mean , it 's not like either side will be working on improving relations anytime soon ... 
  yeah , same here in slovenia . 
  but if we have to pick sides , germany is still a bigger business partner . 
  the situation kind of sucks either way , though . 
  ah , `` countless '' , a number that can be as high as 1,000,000,000,000,000 when you 're counting grains of sand , and as low as 2 when you 're counting `` guys that said something i did n't like '' . 
  well , i do n't think any nato country is a `` freeloader '' . 
  i mean , a freeloader would be someone who did n't even bother having a standing army and would depend entirely to other alliance members . 
  i also suspect a freeloader would just be kicked out entirely . 
  of course . 
  but that 's what i 'm saying , you 're vulnerable either way . 
  that 's why defensive alliances such as nato are a thing . 
  why , i am flabbergasted , stunned with shock and swept off my feet !, 
  i so totally did not see that coming !, 
  okay , just kidding . 
  i mean , you do n't have to be psychic to know this was going to happen before it was reported . 
  ... okay , excuse my shameless realism , but even meeting defense spending targets is n't really going to make them invincible . 
  ah , but do they have their own courts of law ? 
  even if they can get a lawyer for a civil case , the court itself is tax-funded , so they would not have access to it . 
  no `` private security '' is going to be infallible , and you would n't legally be able to use it to get your stuff back if someone steals it or anything . 
  your property would n't be protected by law if you were n't paying taxes , under my suggestion . 
  and if you send out some enforcers to take it by force , you 've broken the law , and since you 're not paying taxes , you do n't have access to due process even if you can buy a defense attorney . 
  it 's actually quite evil . 
  there are many things rich people benefit a lot more from than the poor , which are tax funded . 
  as i always say , `` corruption in politics is n't worse here than anywhere else . 
  merely just as bad . '', 
  well , socialism hated jazz , for some reason ... 
  that garbage looks mighty suspicious , like it 's going to try some funny business . 
  better to nip it in the bud . 
  well penniless people are n't good for the economy , no matter how you turn it . 
  so yeah , if they get some basic money to get through the month , they 'll buy stuff with it . 
  and in buying stuff with it , they 'll create revenue for the businesses they buy from . 
  so yes , it does make sense to try and get some domestic consumption going . 
  so , unless i am very much mistaken , their historical neutrality is nothing but a clever ruse ? 
  it all makes sense now !, 
  now i have an idea for a new eu4 game , what with custom nation maker now and all . 
  well you know , if you deal with clients , some of them are bound to be the kind that you really do n't like , as anyone who ever worked in customer service could tell you . 
  sweden just ca n't get a break , the other day netanyahu accused them of trying to depose him in israel  . <, 
  i always said everyone should have the option to not pay taxes at all . 
  however , by taking that option they would also agree to not have access to tax-funded services , like public education , public healthcare , law enforcement , public roads ... after all , if you 're not paying for it , why should you get to use it ? 
  yeah , booo left wing . 
  we 'd be settling alpha centauri by now if it were n't for them !, 
  on a more serious note , my impression is that it 's rather mixed . 
  lots of angry people from all sides of the political spectrum . 
  well , yes , but had it remained in serbia , it would be a serbian problem . 
  now it is n't . 
  depends , really ... i mean , if you have a slave touching your food while preparing it or bringing it , you are going to make sure they have clean living quarters and hygienic utilities , for example . 
  so you 'll make sure they have a reasonably good standard of living . 
  you do n't have to treat them badly , but they 're still a slave in that they work involuntarily and for free . 
  `` so a guy walks into a bar , and says i 'd like a molotov , please '', 
  well it is all about the point of view . 
  `` deserving of getting molotovs thrown at 'em '' is pretty much a more strongly worded `` i really do n't like those guys '' . 
  `` primary surplus '' is exactly what `` surplus before interest payments '' * means . 
  yeah sure . 
  i 'm certain that they 're all exactly like that , because a rather conceited person on the internet told me so . 
  i 'm also sure that 's exactly what 's going on in frankfurt , because the same person said so . 
  booo marxists , they 're why we ca n't have nice things , and all . 
  or something . 
  well , the way kosovo is right now , would n't it be kind of `` more trouble than it 's worth '' ? 
  anyone can be a fucking idiot , that does n't depend on political leaning and ideology or vice versa . 
  in germany , drinking a lot of beer would tend to de-escalate things , methinks . 
  you should n't feel ashamed just because some asshats happen to agree with you on some points .

  what the fuck is up with the title ? 
  you . 
  i love the comments under the youtube video . 
  how often can you say that ? 
  not this shit again . 
  i would n't be so quick to point fingers , you son of viking pillagers .

  because he is edgy , i guess ? 
  ascension of romania to european union thus giving it open borders ... 
  i wanted to post this myself but it seems pretty irrelevant if you do n't have something to compare it against . 
  gipsy population in europe today , for example . 
  it is an honour to think that we slovenes were once part of the same country as the glorious sons of alexander the great . 
  it must be noted however that austria is a rich country that has a population of 8,5 million compared to our 's 2 million . 
  and most importantly it never was in interest of people in transit to stay here . 
  they openly said that their destination was germany . 
  are we supposed to beg them to stay or something ? 
  i am not sure . 
  a thousand . 
  how many did austria accept ? 
  i thought you were just another stop on their way to germany . 
  i 'm not entirely sure who you are implying but we took in refugees as well . 
  the ones that considered our country worthy of their stay anyway . 
  you make it sound as if all statisticians count us as one . 
  while the example you provided is one in a very few i have actually seen and do n't really know why that is in practice ? 
  expect of austrian to first jump on the racism train . 
  stupid suggestion because the countries that joined later can not be blamed for current issues we are dealing with . 
  that 's when you know you are a shithole . 
   caroline de bendern : ` we need to form a bloc against countries like russia who want to destroy europe and ... absorb it . ' i could n't manage reading forward . 
  building \u2260 structure, 
  til the tallest building in europe is in russia . 
  what is it ? 
   if anyone has any questions , issues or would like to know the tallest in any country , just let me know . 
   - / u/bezzleford , author of the map maybe he cares to pinch in ? 
  paging / u/bezzleford . 
  credit goes to / u/bezzleford who also pointed out the following things :  this map shows the tallest building in each country in europe . 
  here are a few sidenotes :  the map excludes structures like tv towers ( e.g. 
  fernsehturm ) and monuments ( e.g. 
  eiffel tower ) . 
  i have only listed storied buildings . 
   the map only lists buildings by their architectural height , as defined by either the ctbuh or skyscrapercenter . 
  thus , buildings like the commerzbank tower in germany are listed as 259m , not 300m ( as the antenna mask is considered an outside element ) . 
   all buildings were rounded to the nearest meter . 
  thus , spain 's tallest building ( torre de cristal ) is listed as 249m not 250m . 
   the tallest building in europe is the east tower of the federation tower in moscow ( at 374m high ) . 
   the tallest building in europe under construction is the lakhta center in st petersburg which will rise to 462m . 
   for anyone who is n't familiar with meters , the key in feet is : 300m ( 980 ft ) , 250m ( 820ft ) , 200m ( 650ft ) , 150m ( 490ft ) , 100m ( 330ft )  the cevahir towers in macedonia ( rising to 142m ) are not listed as i 'm not 100 % certain they 're complete . 
  if anyone has further information that would be great . 
   had the uk been split into 4 nations , only wales would be in the 100-149m category . 
   if anyone has any questions , issues or would like to know the tallest in any country , just let me know . 
  # ` israel will not hesitate to destroy syrian air defenses ' by anna ahronheim march 19 , 2017 13:54 ** `` israel 's security is paramount and above everything else . 
  there will be no compromise . 
  '' ** ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- defense minister avigdor liberman threatened on sunday that israel `` will not hesitate '' to destroy syria 's air defense systems if israeli fighter jets are ever targeted again . 
  `` you have to understand the context , if we strike there is a real reason for it , '' he said while visiting the idf induction center . 
  `` we have no interest in intervening in the civil war in syria , either in favor or against [ president bashar ] assad , '' he said . 
  `` we do not want to clash with the russians . 
  our main issue is with the transfer of advanced weaponry from syria to lebanon and so whenever we detect an attempt to smuggle weapons , we will act to prevent it . 
  we will not compromise on this issue . '' liberman warned that there will be `` no compromise '' on the transfer of weapons to hezbollah and if air-defense systems are used again by the syrian regime against iaf jets , as they were on friday , israel will `` destroy them . 
  we will not hesitate . 
  israel 's security is paramount and above everything else . 
  there will be no compromise . '' israel 's arrow anti-aircraft missile defense system was used to intercept a syrian s-5 missile fired at iaf jets that had already returned to israeli airspace after carrying out airstrikes against targets in syria on friday night . 
  liberman also addressed the situation in the south of the country , saying that `` we will not invest israeli taxpayer money to invest in electricity and water for the residents of gaza while they are investing their money into tunnels . '' `` we are not willing to tolerate any provocation , '' he stressed . 
  `` the idf will respond strongly to every rocket fired from the gaza strip . '' liberman warned that there will be `` no compromise '' on the transfer of weapons to hezbollah and if air-defense systems are used again by the syrian regime against iaf jets , as they were on friday , israel will `` destroy them . 
  we will not hesitate .

  i do n't want to see spain break up . 
  especially not now , in this already troubled times . 
   skating home from work this sounds amazing . 
  try [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23x14hs4glk ) . 
   free europe what is that ? 
  no , actually . 
  but , yeah he does look similair it is just a very young photo of him . 
  21 then . 
  if the immigrants are in fact learning the language then that is not a sign of failure of immigrant system . 
  the most beatiful of them all . 
  nowhere did i state it was funny . 
  and so on and on . 
  what i and at least a couple of others ( 21 upvotes , 86 % upvote ratio ) have found * interesting * is the way the man is doing it . 
  there is no point in explaining it . 
  you either get it or not . 
  you are free to downvote/report . 
  not everybody likes everything . 
  i never said there is anything wrong with it . 
  so it begins . 
  again . 
  where are we ? 
  this is where gypsies and homeless people live here so i really do n't know how this deserves critisizm . 
  being a secular country does not mean no religion it just means that government and religion are separated . 
  i am sure you meant islam . 
  our state media does not have a mobile friendly website .

  if there 's a demand for it , why not supply it ? 
  `` we are the 65 % ! '', 
  `` concocts '' . 
  now that word gave me a mental image that makes me giggle . 
  it involves putin dancing around a large bubbling cauldron with smoke the color any normal smoke has no right to be , stirring in a pinch of self-aggrandizement , a few drops of glorious patriotism , a healthy dose of misinformation , and an eye of a newt . 
  i wish someone would draw that , because i ca n't draw to save my life . 
  will they get james spader to read it ? 
  pretty much . 
  some people just revel in victimhood . 
  easy way to notice them : they act like victims even when they 're not actually victims of anything . 
  not sure , doubt that belorussian passports are in high demand on the black market as the former yugoslav ones used to be in those times . 
  even if he actually meant that , that 'd be nothing short of delusional . 
  and they 're abbreviated as `` laws '' . 
  mandatory judge dredd reference here , especially if some wiseguy decides to give them voiceboxes . 
  `` proves ? '', 
  more like `` adds to the pile of already pretty much conclusive evidence '' . 
  but hey , that 'd make for a headline without a punch . 
  it 's officer crabtree , you see . 
  `` i was pissing by the door , when i heard two shats . 
  you are holding in your hand a smoking goon ; you are clearly the guilty potty ! '', 
  i gather that for russia , that 's quite a lot . 
  still , 12 hour shifts in what pretty much amounts to `` cubicle farming '' , that sounds horrible . 
  oh hey , an actual written post by a russian person instead of the usual poorly draw meme-type jokes , credit for effort right here . 
  and i 'm not being sarcastic , always a good thing when people actually look up things instead of going `` lol proofs '' . 
  i was mostly making a joke , since it seems all countries have a region that 's `` oh ... * those * guys ... '', 
  i want to read it before deciding ( as in , read the actual treaty text ) . 
  and that means i 'll have to wait a bit . 
  russia at least makes sense for football , whereas qatar ... 
  only swedes would put a hockey venue into the center of a solar system . 
  okay , maybe canadians would , too . 
  but as a hockey fan , i very much like that :d, 
  seriously ? 
  honestly , people have time for the damnest things these days ... 
  ai n't he adorable . 
  still a whole week until the deadline . 
  i 'm only going to start believing any news about greece on 4th june , 23:50 . 
  ... for i could n't , they kept interrupting to correct me . 
  every tourist ever i 've talked to < . <, 
  i thought bayern is n't `` really '' germany . 
  i think that 's the * misconception * , not the clarification . 
  basically , his answer is `` the misconception that romania is actually named for the indigenous romani people . '', 
  we are not `` open , friendly and generous people '' . 
  we 're conniving and cynical , but you have to spend some time around here to notice . 
  / spoken like a true slovenian . 
  i think the idea here is to hide the sometimes embarrassing reasons for why soldiers die in training accidents or while on base . 
  are n't we trying to wreck russia 's economy ? 
  let 'em bankroll it . 
  it 's not like the country hosting the cup makes a profit , fifa does . 
  the country 's just going to be left with expensive stadiums that will never be looked at again after the event . 
  now now , those bribes were given while adhering to the strict terms of paragraph 3 , article 47/4-a of `` how to bribe officials and make sure the color of the envelope is the correct shade of blue '' , there 's nothing illegal about them . 
  the first one was during rehearsal and the second one was n't in moscow , it was in chita , which happens to be closer to mongolia and china than it is to moscow . 
  you mean like the one in some backwater nobody cares about unless it gets hit by a meteorite ? 
  not sure that 's going to hit either of them that hard , but honestly , i 've got my own prejudice against twitter and facebook , so i 'm a biased source here . 
  oh , i see `` affluenza '' is catching on as a defense in russia , too , now is n't it ? 
  exactly !, 
  that 's what i was going for !, 
  the `` where is proofs '' line stopped being funny about three seconds after it was first use to poke fun at the russian `` denying everything '' . 
  it 's really a one-use wonder , was funny that one time , and is just obnoxious now ... or well , maybe not obnoxious , just ... boring . 
  we should come up with something else . 
  like `` but that bribe was given according to rules and regulations , how can it be wrong ? '', 
  ahhh , russia can calm down , blatter himself said that they 'll keep the cup . 
  would he * lie * ? 
  `` do n't you think that the uk might be better off if it does n't consider not being outside the european union ? '', 
  oh wow , that did n't take long . 
  well i 'll be ... who ` da thunk it , huh ? 
   also , danish block politics seem crazy . 
  hardcore classical liberals in the same block as nationalists , social liberals in the same block as democratic socialists ? 
  well , of course you 'd say that , you swedish person . 
  ( am i doing this right ? ), 
   does those people include yourself ? 
  nah , i 've kind of accepted the fact that i 'll never have a shot at `` all the money ''  but i stand by my point - people simply do n't have the capacity for long-term thinking . 
  myself included . 
  mid-term at best . 
  if there 's one thing i learned , living in this world for three decades and a bit more , is that people tend to not really have a capacity for long-term thinking . 
  if i can have `` all the money '' today , even if it 's doomsday tomorrow , hey , i got all the money , suckers !, 
  ( that 's how an average human being seems to be thinking ), 
  well , it 's very hard to believe that he was unaware of this corruption taking place . 
  not that i would have anything against prison labor in * principle * ... but , eh who am i kiddin ' ? 
  there 's no way this is going to happen in a proper , transparent and laborer-friendly manner in this particular case , is there . 
  to me it seems as if the only problem with * that * is `` we did n't think of it first '' . 
  actually it 's become a synonym for `` guys i do n't like '' . 
  speaking of which , `` putinist '' has also become a synonym for `` guys i do n't like '' . 
  problem is that `` not thinking putin is a cartoon villain '' seems to be conflated with `` admiring putin '' around here . 
  and yeah , putin 's russia is quite fascist , and currently engaging in a lot of dickery in eastern europe . 
  but , the reasons for that happening are a wee bit more complex than `` russia is evil and wants to take over the world '' . 
  i mean , it 's not like putin called the un and demanded * one million dollars !, 
  * good luck trying to explain that to the average internet dweller , though , you 're just going to get called a shill . 
  the only thing i could maybe , kind of sort of admire about putin for is how he manages to look at least a decade younger than he is . 
  i mean my father looks older than him , and he 's 10 years younger than him !, 
  * how does he do it ? 
  * ( cue `` doctors hate him '' ad spam ), 
  yes , i 'm going to sign myself under this , too . 
  also , i do prefer their more technical style of the hokey game over the north american , more physical contact style . 
  thing is , that `` without treaty change '' is going to keep it precisely as unfinished as it currently is . 
  does n't that sound a bit like `` valve replacement without open heart surgery '' ? 
  it 's missing croatia .

  apparently the swiss do n't like to follow bilateral agreements they signed .

  what does tim pool have to do with breitbart ? 
   pool 's coverage has been carried and syndicated by multiple mainstream outlets such as nbc , reuters , al jazeera , rt , and time . 
  he has also been featured in fast company , wired , and time . 
   in 2013 pool joined vice media producing and hosting content as well as developing new methods of reporting . 
   in 2014 , he joined fusion tv as director of media innovation and senior correspondent .

   ** i would have understood if the court had ruled on a concession to use a narrow strip without registration ** , but to bend international law like that does n't seem fair at all . 
  and exactly this happened . 
  those are still croatian waters .

  in operations against germans , in the northern parts of yugoslavia , some red army units took part in the last months of war . 
  they doubtlessly fought bravely against germans and suffered great losses . 
  on the other hand , the attitude of many officers and soldiers in those units was not in accordance to expectations of our people on how red army soldiers were supposed to behave . 
  wherever red army units passed , people would complain about excesses of many officers and soldiers . 
  a large number of women and girls was assaulted , many were raped , there were reports of murder and robbery . 
  initially , attempts were made to explain to people those were just isolated incidents , but the number of crimes was steadily rising . 
  it was massively harmful to the reputation of the red army and soviet union , and it was also a problem to our political work , since before the war we told our people completely different stories about the red army . 
  the atrocities became so widespread they became a serious political problem . 
   in total , our government organs received 1219 reports of rape , 359 of rape attempt , 111 of rape with murder , 248 of rape with murder attempt and 1204 reports of robbery with physical harm committed by individual officers and soldiers of the red army . 
  among the raped girls there was also a secretary of the district committee of the communist youth in vojvodina . 
  even the wife of a member of the national committee [ provisional government ] was assaulted . 
  there were some cases of rape in belgrade which caused resentment among our soldiers and citizens . 
  already during the battle for belgrade , in october 1944 , a female courier of the 6th lika division , carrying an order to the frontline , was stopped by a russian captain who tried to rape her . 
  when she resisted , he wounded her with a knife and raped her while she was unconscious . 
  especially two cases in \u010cukarica caused great disturbances among inhabitants of belgrade . 
  several russian soldiers gang-raped the daughter of a worker in sugar plant , who was communist party member since 1939 . 
  this girl was so demoralised and beaten-down that she ceased all political activities . 
  another citizen in \u010cukarica invited a group of soldiers , petty officers and officers to a dinner in his house . 
  after the dinner , when the russians got drunk , a red army major assaulted the host 's wife in front of him . 
  when he attempted to defend her , russians threw him out ; while he was running around the neighborhood screaming for help , his wife was raped by seven russians . 
  this event caused a real stupefaction in belgrade . 
   after this incident politburo of the cpy arranged a meeting with chief of the soviet military mission , general korneyev , to inform him about the shameful behaviour that was destroying the reputation of the red army . 
  our generals peko dap\u010devi\u0107 and ko\u010da popovi\u0107 were present at this meeting . 
  the remarks were made in friendly and comradely form . 
  milovan \u0110ilas then said that those excesses were additionally nasty because the belgrade bourgeoisie used them against the red army and commented that the english officers ( who were present in their military mission at the supreme headquarters of our army ) were behaved better than the soviet ones . 
   but korneyev refused to even listen to our complaints . 
  he immediately started protesting :  `` in the name of the red army command , i protest against these accusations because they are untrue ! '',

  can i ask why ? 
  funny that the only guy i got an answer from is a finn . 
  how did he get the money for all his activism ? 
  i enjoy triggering nationalists , and russian nationalists are uncommonly easy to trigger . 
  but honestly , i do n't believe in inferiority . 
  i do believe in incompatibility , though , and as it seems russian ( political ) culture is fundamentally incompatible with central european . 
  dealing with russian businessmen only strengthened that conviction . 
  i do n't . 
  do you deny that russia did fuck all to fix the damage soviet union did ? 
  while killing balts , poles and caucasus peoples en masse and expelling whole ethnic groups to siberia . 
  authoritarian . 
  everything is about him and what he 'll do , which is the main hint that he only wants to be the caliph instead of the caliph . 
  considering he was tight with upper echelons with putin 's cartel before doing about-face , most probably really corrupt . 
  stop being corrupt imperialist idiots , take a moment to reflect on what your country and your grandpas did , make some amends and i 'll immediately retract everything i said . 
  exactly . 
  the story of my grandpa 's dad being burned alive in a school building in an istrian village by germans does sicken me , but at least i know that only a rare kind of idiots excuse such acts . 
  i guess partisan vets whom i recite war poems on their anniversaries would be very disappointed to hear that . 
  i 'm perfectly aware of lithuanian resistance movement in ww2 . 
  i only wish we also had an anti-communist resistance movement ( chetniks do n't count ) . 
  i 'm not talking about forest brothers . 
  i 'm talking about redditors . 
  so tell me , what would it take for your country to once in your history stop being a kleptocratic , aggressive dictatorship ? 
  and do n't say navalny . 
  he 's just another putin , a wolf in sheep 's clothing . 
  i 'm pissed off at russia because i like it . 
  first time i heard about them , so no , i 'm not saying that . 
  what i 'm saying is that this attitude `` soviets were worse because they were mass-murdering * us * , while nazis were only mass-murdering jews '' seems to be somewhat widespread among pisters on reddit from baltic countries . 
  and i find that attitude disturbing , to say the least . 
  just do n't expect balts to show any sympathy . 
  this is actually what annoys me the most about their concept of ww2 : holocaust happened to `` them '' , gulags happened to `` us '' . 
  you ca n't expect a muzhik to understand anything but knout . 
  there is no process . 
  russians genuinely support putin 's regime , which is just ussr in shiny suits . 
  russians genuinely like stalin . 
  russians genuinely think that their ( mostly self-inflicted ) suffering excuses their crimes , which they committed wherever they appeared . 
  they were raping and plundering even in yugoslavia , and we were supposed to be their allies . 
  russia will never learn anything from history . 
  russia is a basket case . 
  lol, 
  they 're in the op . 
  did you , um , read my post ? 
  because then you would , um , notice that my question was rhetorical . 
  i do n't know . 
  how come nobody really hates germans ? 
  let 's be realistic : the today 's problem is not so much what soviets did . 
  the problem is that russians genuinely think they 're good guys and i do n't know what would it take to convince them otherwise . 
  well , we 're definitely more conceited than the apes . 
   we spent half as much in real terms , on the iraq reconstruction as we had on the marshall plan ... and the marshall plan had to cover far more destruction , countries , and people . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but was n't marshall plan aimed at giving a financial boost to the new european governments so that they could do the actual reconstruction themselves , while reconstruction of iraq was instead done by american firms with iraqis only as a source of labour ? 
  aw fuck reagan , brezhnev and fahd for whipping up this cancer .

  goddammit that was a question . 
  i do n't know of a single instance where a large influx of immigrants did n't spark a xenophobic backlash at some point . 
  what false accusation ? 
  ah well , misunderstandings happen . 
  no , it happened in slovenia , but i thought it was about non-violent , low-level xenophobia being irritating . 
  i was in poland only as a tourist . 
  [ there 's actually a polish wikipedia article about the word \u010defur , for some reason . 
  ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/czefur ) kinda chauvinistically written too . 
  no idea where he got that number of illegals . 
  i felt angry , to tell you the truth , and my first impulse was to go after him and bash him across his stupid head . 
  i ultimately did n't do anything except muttering `` what an asshole '' or something . 
  why would i feel guilty ? 
  wait , are you seriously implying ukrainians and poles are the same people ? 
  sure , why not ? 
  i sit on a bus stop with my mom and talk with her in croatian ( because that 's why it 's called `` mother language '' ) and some blonde dick passes by with his girlfriend and casually but clearly says to her : `` listen to this \u010defur , they always act like they own the place . '', 
  ah , that ? 
  my then-gf 's parents actually went through her wallet and , when she caught them , explained her that they 're pretty certain that croatian guy she 's seeing is stealing her money . 
  why ? 
  because that 's what croats do , they steal .

  dividing europe by linguistics , except when we 're actually speaking about language groups , makes no sense . 
  we are fully green , if you can not see . 
  we are fully green . 
  it does n't rhyme though . 
  and thankfully , there was no misunderstanding , i 'm still here . 
  on my travels , of people i met , dutch were for sure on of the most ignorant ones . 
  they really think highly of themselves . 
  that 's just one of the concepts ... 
  that 's horrible and probably one of the reasons more guys do n't go into this profession . 
  my girlfriend said a lot of parents actually express a wish for their kids to be in groups with male teachers . 
  seeing a naked child in kindergarten comes with a job . 
  they have to change their diapers , clean their butts and help with their potty training . 
  sure ? 
  ours just shows all the municipalities not [ administrative units ] ( http://www.upravneenote.gov.si/ ) . 
  my girlfriend is a kindergarten teacher and male teachers are rare . 
  however , they are super popular among head teachers , other teachers and parents because they look at kids from a different perspective ( less emotions ) and if you 're a male kindergarten teacher you are almost guaranteed to get a job immediately . 
  kids love them as well . 
  i feel like male designers are a lot more common than female designers . 
  and male nurses are a normal sight here as well . 
  my dog . 
  how about no ? 
  do we have a disproportional number of municipalities or what the heck is going on with us ? 
  how come slovakia is east ? 
  hungary just sticks out , so makes me think this is not geographical . 
  in that case , part of slovenia could also be southern .

  not just likely , just a few weeks ago it was said it was a ducth - spanish thing . 
  i 'm sorry but at first i thought it was a pig screaming . 
  to answer the question . 
  trapping a thief is fine . 
  they did n't have to laugh about it and film it . 
  that woman needs to chill though , but it 's a tactic to appear as a victim and gain sympathies . 
   no , they 're doing it because up until a few days ago the punishment was less than carrying or using a knife . 
  so ... they 're treating the cause by raising the punishement . 
  it 's only a matter of time . 
  the problem is with dutch eggs , not belgian eggs .

  [ one of them ] ( http://www.noviglas.eu/vipavski-priimki-2 ) other variations of the last name found in slovenia are furlani and furlani\u010d . 
  furlani is a romance language variation , furlan and furlani\u010d are slavic . 
  this is probably my favourite place in the whole country . 
  craving some \u017eganci and kislo mleko right now . 
  i really need to ask this on r/explainlikeimfive . 
  uk people keep insisting this despite their climate not being neither very cold nor hot . 
  if your house is well insulated it works in both heat and cold . 
  obviously no house can retain a constant temperature without a heating/cooling system despite how it 's made . 
  unless it 's built into the ground . 
  the difference with the us is that they have hvac things in their houses . 
   just one day ( 31 july ) where the temperature passed 25 degrees ha ... 
  this is the 4th heatwave here ( temperatures 30 and higher ) . 
  usually a heatwave lasts 5-7 days . 
  where i am , we use 1-5 , 8 and 10 . 
  6 si known but not really used . 
  7 and 9 i have never heard of . 
  lunch , transportation , afternoon and night shifts , sunday/holiday work , dangerous work ... etc. 
  used to be counted in base salary , they 're add on 's now , for almost 2 years . 
  it 's an europol thing . 
  slovenia has similar , so do other countries . 
  they 're not . 
  some things are cheaper ( mostly store brand names ) but most other things are more expensive . 
  all my sources say furlan ( as in last name , not what people are called ) is of slovene origin . 
  the last name is also a lot more common in slovenia than in italy . 
  origin of the last name , not origin of the word ` friuli ' is slovene . 
  the last name has slovene origins . 
  it 's how people in slovenia identified them back then when last names were starting to become a thing . 
  we also have lah for anyone of italian descent/lived/worked / fought/or traded with italians . 
  what part of ` natural water sources dry ' did n't you understand . 
  that means there 's drught and when there 's drught it would be shitty of people to use city water . 
  even private wells that are usually used to water plants dry out . 
  what else are people supposed to use but rain water or water supplied by firefighters ? 
  it 's only responsible to have a rain water tank somewhere to collect rain . 
  and when you do , some crazy austrian kills it and skins it :( [ warning !, 
  furlan is a slovene last name for anyone of italian , slovene or german origin that lived in friuli and then in slovenia .

  we were the first to leave , and now we 're somehow the only ex-yugo country that you still see as yugos . 
  with 200 million viewers , i think it 's safe to say that eurovision is popular in a lot of places . 
   why slovenia is a subdeveloped country screw you , spain . 
  they call the colour `` azzurro savoia '' ( savoy blue ) , referencing the [ house of savoy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_savoy ) . 
  apparently blue was their official colour . 
  oh yeah do n't worry , we all know they 're gypsies . 
  i do n't think i 've actually met a `` real '' romanian person before , but i do know that the ones we have begging and stealing around europe are mostly gypsies . 
  romanian beggars earn a ton of money all over europe . 
  they started appearing in slovenia a few years ago and it 's fascinating to see them work . 
  it 's usually middle aged women , dressed in the saddest rags possible , looking all crippled and sick in front of bigger shopping centers . 
  after a long day of whining and just being generally annoying , they miraculously regain their health and jump to the parking lot , where they get picked up by their families in brand new bmws . 
  my grandma is in full rage mode because all of her fruit trees were damaged . 
  how did they manage to forget both slovenia and slovakia ?? 
  unacceptable !, 
  same here . 
  i watch so many british shows anyways , and i 'd rather pay for it than feel bad for watching it illegally . 
  i use hola , even though it 's not the safest thing out there . 
  ads and a portion of the televoting money . 
  i use a vpn to watch it live on the bbc website . 
  i never watch it on tv anymore , because our presenters suck , so i either watch the official youtube stream with no commentators or find a way to watch norton 's version . 
  it 's only a waste of money if you host . 
  a regular participant earns a bunch of money from it every year . 
  eurovision got bad , and then it kept getting worse , to the point where it 's now actually good again , because of how terrible it is . 
  i love watching it , just to laugh at weird acts and graham norton 's snarky comments . 
  smartflix was blocked but they managed to make it work again . 
  it works great , but it 's not free anymore . 
  several eu countries did n't get house of cards , because other tv channels in those countries already own the distribution rights . 
  which is why i 'll stop paying for it . 
  used to be great before they got so serious about banning proxies , and the vpn service i use ( smartflix ) is n't free anymore . 
  netflix is not worth the hassle . 
  that 's because slovenia was a part of the austrian empire back then . 
  the lipica stud farm is definitely on slovenian territory now though . 
  this is obviously just a joke . 
  he 's actually pretty competent . 
  during his time in office , he has implemented a bunch of pretty major reforms , so he 's definitely not someone who just likes to talk but would never actually do anything . 
  yep , they had some set photos on / r/starwars last week . 
  every place in that area is stunning . 
  i spent a week in volterra 2 years ago and i still miss it . 
  they will more then likely learn at least one or two new foreign languages when they enter school . 
  so teaching them their local language at this age wo n't hurt them in any way . 
  true , but i 'd still say we 're pretty low on the list of importance . 
  we 're just kind of there . 
  apart from our long time territory feud with croatia , we do n't really mess with anyone 's business , so nobody pays any attention to us . 
  [ oh god , it makes so much sense !, 
  neutral . 
  we 're tiny and pretty insignificant , so they have no real interests in our country . 
  we also do n't really care about them , because apart from a history of communism , we have almost nothing in common . 
  no , i meant that he never really expressed a desire to connect with slovenia , at lest not as far as i know . 
  i mean , look at us , nobody cares about us politically . 
  i feel like putin does n't really care about slovenia enough to desire stronger bonds . 
  he was invited by the slovenian president , not the other way around . . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/pahor-vabi-putina-na-100-obletnico-ruske-kapelice.html?bl=0 ) article says that the invitation has already been accepted unoficially . 
  so he 's most likely coming . 
  it 's not going to be an official state visit though . 
  he 's just coming to the chapel ceremony . 
  different countries have different data plans . 
  i pay 15 eur per month and i have unlimited texting , unlimited calls and 5gb of internet . 
  no need for whatsapp unless i travel abroad . 
  not that popular in slovenia , at least as far as i know . 
  most of us already have unlimited calls and texts included in our data package , so there 's no need for additional apps to save money . 
  those of us who live near the borders also have the option of paying a few extra euros every month to save money on calls/texts across the border . 
  i only download whatsapp when i go on holiday and need a cheap way to communicate with my family , but i do n't need it at home . 
  probably german , because it 's used in more than one country and is already a pretty popular language . 
  and maybe italian or spanish , because if you know one you kinda know the other , and many people across the world speak one of those . 
  if you work in the tourism industry or own an international business , russian might a good choice too . 
  is the west more industrial ? 
  because that 's why italy 's north is doing so well . 
  pretty much the entirety of italy 's factory industry is concentrated in the north , which created a ton of jobs . 
  the problem is the way it 's distributed around the country . 
  the average is 11 % because of how good the north is doing , but most of the south is at 20 % + . 
  i never said she started it . 
  but what she said definitely encouraged more people to come . 
  i can vividly remember watching the news last year and hearing immigrants thank merkel for opening her arms to them and things like that . 
  she was n't just responding , no . 
  instead of nipping things in the bud , she said that germany will remain open for immigrants , which surely influenced hundreds of thousands of people to come to europe . 
  everyone agrees she played a big part in this . 
  because it does n't have a national minimum wage . 
   she said this had put greece in a `` very difficult situation '' and such decisions should be taken by the whole of the eu . 
  oh yeah , like how she made the decision to invite millions of people to europe with the rest of the eu , right ? 
  she almost single-handedly caused this , and now she 's complaining because other , much smaller and `` weaker '' countries are starting to take precautions in order to protect themselves . 
  i do n't know if that 's actually true . 
  most of them carry some cash or at least jewellery . 
  it really is a bit odd to not see this mentioned in any major slovenian newspaper . 
  this is all i could find : http://www.regionalobala.si/novica/balkanske-migracijske-poti-ni-vec-zaveznistvo-zdrave-pameti-in-red-v-evropi, 
  if they close the borders with trieste , how will i buy cheap nutella and laundry detergent ? 
  an open border with italy is of paramount importance for my family . 
  was it in trieste by any chance ? 
  there 's a bigger chance of seeing triglav in a dry dock in trieste than the slovenian sea . 
  we really do n't use these boats at all . 
  we use them to help other countries ( mostly italy with refugees in the south ) . 
  there 's really nothing for them do on the slovenian coast , so they 're almost never here . 
  probably . 
  i still think the biggest factor is media . 
  growing up with cartoon network alone was a good enough reason to learn the language . 
  i 'm pretty sure most of us would speak ( or at least understand ) english even if it was never taught at school , because it 's a part of our daily lives . 
  you probably only watch movies and tv in your native language , so you do n't have such an incentive to learn others . 
  countries with dubbing have the same problem . 
  i live close to the italian border , and my friends from the italian side speak significantly worse english , because all of their media is in italian . 
  slovenia is slavic and we 're pretty high on the list . 
  i think it has more to do with general culture and type of education than the native language .

i know . 
  but if have to choose between a far-right and a far-left candidate in the second round , you might have a problem . 
  even with two rounds , plurality voting system seems increasingly broken if this are the results it produces . 
  i do n't imagine the majority of french citizens supporting either of the two . 
  ( if you 're wondering about the alternative : ranked voting ) . 
  i think it 's more than one factor at work here . 
  i tend to agree abortion legislation is the main factor in ni and poland , but in slovenia abortion is legal up to 10 weeks into pregnancy , yet it tops the list here . 
  so i 'm thinking this map should n't be read so much as displaying lone-parent families as families with unmarried partners ( oxymoron ? 
  dunno , but many slovenes have kids , live togeteher yet do n't marry , thechnically being lone-parent families . 
  edit : there 's actually some legislation covering such arrangements under `` non-matrimony partnership '' , but no idea how that 's interpreted for the purpose of this graphic ) . 
  i for one welcome back our old german overlords . 
  yes , it has problems , but that should n't be a reason to throw away the baby out with the bathwater , like it 's popular with many eu critics . 
  i 'm pretty sure they could do without one of their sachsen . 
  well , after we 've helped re-establish the upper eu flag , we figured we could best protect it by relocating to the place above it , 
  well , the eu has been created mostly to keep germany and france from beating the shit out of eachother , so i think the current situation is fitting . 
  let 's admit it , everyone else are just hangers-on . 
  to serve as a bulwark for the eu , of course !, 
  i agree spain should be helped in drawing their flag , but i prefer the eu flag at the intersection of france and germany . 
  most importantly , though , italy already has their flag https://www.reddit.com/r/place#x=123&amp;y=325 and forcing france to give up further pixels seems unfair . 
  so beautiful , volunteering to anschluss some french clay . 
  where were the italians when the germans decided to invade , i wonder ... 
  take up your pixels and fight !, 
  join la r\u00e9sistance and help draw an eu flag in between and end this madness !, 
  afaik the eu regulations require that pipeline operator and gas provider be two different entities ( free market and all that ) . 
  that was not the case with south stream ( both gas and pipeline [ at about 50 % share ] would be owned by gazprom ) so it was nixed . 
  curiously nord stream is no different in that regard , yet it is ok ... 
  well , now you seem to be saying the british empire was n't quite as nasty as any other ... 
  makes me sometimes think , what if trialism had succeeded ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:trijalisti%c4%8dki_prijedlog_prema_nzb_1910.png, 
  so much lebensraum ... 
  maybe pothole-riddled roads result in people driving more carefully ? 
  good guess . 
  in slovene and german , at least , it means `` label '' . 
  i have a feeling you might be interested in [ this ] ( https://www.electricitymap.org/?wind=false&amp;solar=false&amp;page=map ) . 
  i 'm not sure why data for lux currently is n't shown , i think it usually is . 
  otherwise , yeah ... not all renewable energy is necessarily sustainable . 
  it 's also interesting that in slovene qc4 and qc13 differ ( ` totally comfortable/pleasant ' vs ` very comfortable/pleasant ' ) . 
  it 's like someone actually translated by hand without specialised translation software , which is nowadays pretty much standard everywhere . 
  qc13 is , i assume , structured similarly , but , yeah , that 's not conclusive . 
  thankfully you 're working hard to rectify this . 
  one interstellar bypass at a time . 
  villages were a mistake . 
  nomadic lifestyle ftw : if you do n't trust your neighbours , you just pack up your yurt and move . 
  ha , good one !, 
  i do n't know . 
  i 've wondered about this one before . 
  it 's certainly not recent , the oldest source i 've found till now is from [ 1922 ] ( https://www.google.si/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahukewirq_rps9tvahxlfxokhwfqdfuqfggomaa&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dlib.si%2fstream%2furn%3anbn%3asi%3adoc-mo4trfmu%2fb6529edd-fcc9-4c7a-b98f-bc6731877c05%2fpdf&amp;usg=afqjcnfrki_hycaiej9kkj0lxjd-bn8pva ) , while a question in an interview [ here ] ( https://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/hrvati-edini-sosedje-ki-slovencev-niso-ogrozali/90040 ) implies its from the time of a-h . as for why -- who knows . 
  maybe one of your ancestors stole a few chickens or did n't buy a round in a tavern ? 
  only if you 're within a few metres of the border fence when they decide to nudge it further south . 
   occasional prickle should help that smugness not become even more insufferable . 
  you 've somewhat failed in that respect , though , as the realisation there 's no established jokes for putting down the neighbours so one can feel better about oneself is only making me feel more smug . 
  perhaps ? 
  the largest minorities are immigrants from ex-yu countries and their offspring , albanians , roma , italians and hungarians . 
  i think it 's mostly how the question was phrased . 
   how comfortable they would feel if one of their sons or daughters was in a love relationship with a person from a different ethnic group this would be taken to mean `` anyone but slovene '' . 
  in this light , the percentage makes sense . 
  slovenes may not be nationalistic , but they can be quite xenophobic . 
  especially towards the people from ` down south ' . 
  nope . 
  81 % for slovenia . 
  ( page 24 [ here ] ( http://www.equineteurope.org/img/pdf/ebs_437_en.pdf ) ) i do n't know . 
  having a relationship of any kind is taboo now ? 
  firstly , * most * such divisions are theoretical concepts . 
  secondly , mitteleuropa and intermarium have little overlap . 
  if you squint really hard and ignore portugal and greece , sure , such division seems sensible . 
  i concede , i , too , sometimes use * eastern europe * to refer to the ex-communist half of europe , however this is only useful in the dichotomic relationship west -- east . 
  if you do n't see the cold war era western block as a monolithic region , i do n't think * eastern europe * should be seen as such nor why it is helpful to do so , since many states labelled as such have little in common other than being ex-communist . 
  damn , italy , get well soon . 
  yes , simpler , and stuck three decades in the past . 
  leave it to a brit to draw straight lines . 
  however , it 's still a vast improvement from the usual maps . 
  well , this is kind of to be expected from a far-centre news outlet . 
  the same map with the percentages superimposed over the territory of each state . 
  partly kidding -- but doing that would have been helpful . 
  nonetheless , good job . 
  ( hopefully i 've been gentle ), 
  nah , i think we can accommodate greece so they can join the region they rightfully belong to . 
  * occupied * meaning ` ruled/governed a part of the republic of latvia 's current territory ' ? 
  it should be coloured red , because those lands are currently under the occupation of the republic of latvia . 
  not the way i understand it from this short article . 
  the way i see it , long-term renting will become cheaper while due to the limited availability of tourist accommodation , vacationing will be less affordable ( to foreigners and spaniards alike ) . 
  ** less ** affordable if you do n't trust the logic of economics -- it even says so in the opening paragraph :  british tourists are set to find trips to mallorca and ibiza more expensive as a law placing a cap on the number of hotel beds and stricter rules governing holiday rentals are introduced . 
  i like this one , but i 've always felt it could much improve with somewhat tighter pacing , so i just went and [ did it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pno2rc5.png ) . 
  says more about the op than anything else , which is a bit of a shame , because if done properly , such research is rather interesting . 
  yup , hail corporate !, 
  is a steak bought in store a significantly different from a steak bought from store x ? 
  ( rhetorical question ), 
  napoleon -- best kaiser we 've ever had . 
   permanent provisional solution this is an oxymoron if i 've ever seen one . 
  this guy has some potential . 
  also , i think a list of resolved frozen conflicts would be quite a short one . 
  while , presupposing the universe is n't deterministic , this is true , i think this is somewhat beside the original point , which is basically : a person c can not be considered lucky to have been born to persons a and b , because the person c could not have been born to anyone but parents a and b. 
  unless one believes in some congregation of pre-existing souls waiting to ( re ) enter this material world upon conception , a person born to any other parent in any other time , under any other circumstances , etc. 
  would not have been person c. therefore person c can not be considered lucky to , e.g. , have been born to parents a and b and not perhaps parents d and e. 
   kristenmedina * 88 * this video is now banned in germany . 
  i think they 're right , however there 's a considerable disagreement whether the mutations have been generally beneficial or not . 
  much liberal , very wow, 
  i thought it 's missing the pronoun * ihr * , so it would read '' * ihr * deutschen , ihr habt ... '' probably either would have been better ? 
  i actually think it 's rather nice that the greatest man of croatia was slovenian . 
  beneath there 's a pyramid of drowning citizens supporting them . 
  do n't be silly -- that would mean croatia is too .

  i was surprised how many people attended !, 
  it seems that croatians really like czech movies . 
  i saw kolja and i like it . 
  thanks for the recommendations i appreciate it !, 
  i 've seen others also . 
  the last one i saw was vr\u00e1sky z l\u00e1sky . 
  i thought it was okay for one autumn afternoon . 
  nice but nothing special . 
  slovenian movies are so depressing and directors try too hard to be artsy and dark so it 's nice to see that kind of comedies that you have . 
  i like new wave so i liked sedmikr\u00e1sky . 
  happy end is simply great . 
  i really like the idea . 
  i like that movies are funny and light but are n't typical comedies . 
  i have to say that i was not so impressed with prague as some people are . 
  do n't get me wrong it 's a nice city and i think it would be okay to live there . 
  i just think i might be too used of this type of `` hapsburg '' architecture . 
  prices are still lower than slovenian so that is a plus . 
  i 've been in moravia too when i was younger . 
  i do n't have any special opinion about this region . 
  i like czech movies and your language is cute . 
  thank god . 
  ljubljana , slovenia : * one course lunch in a normal restaurant 6-9 eur * lunch menu 4-6 eur, 
  i suppose that is the reason . 
  i do n't think that our mountains in slovenia are closed during the winter so it is a bit unusual to me . 
  why is it open only in these months ? 
  meh i guess i wrote that two times . 
  thank you for noticing !, 
  border between slovenia , austria and italy [ slovenia , austria and italy ] ( http://www.gogorenjska.com/sites/all/files/upload/images/tromeja2.jpg ), 
  eh we are modest compared to croatians . 
  they even have flags on their trams in zagreb . 
  happy [ reformation day !, 
  ] ( http://www.sloveniatimes.com/slovenia-celebrates-reformation-day ), 
  in slovenia they are called indijan\u010dki . 
  slovenian name for native people in america is `` indijanec '' . 
  indijan\u010dek is a small or younger indijanec . 
  when i was in vienna i also saw an older man who was really angry and yell : `` foreigners get out !, 
  you took our jobs !, 
  and so on '' but this might be one of the isolated cases . 
  maybe this is the same guy as yours . 
  i have no idea why is that so . 
  it 's completely illogical i agree . 
  official german translation of gornja radgona is oberradkersburg . 
  ober is gornja in slovenian language ( upper in english ) . 
  burg is a castle , grad in slovenian . 
  so yes it is similar but it is n't exactly the same . 
  vienna is becs in hungarian that is why serbians and croatians call it like that . 
  slovaks call danube dunaj but city itself is viede\u0148 . 
  bakeries and ice cream shops might be similar because they run by albanians . 
  why do you guys count slovenia as part of balkans ? 
  is it because we were once part of yugoslavia ? 
  what else ? 
  geographically we only partially in balkans . 
  i 'm curious . 
  we were for long long long under the austrians . 
  we do n't have turbo folk music as they have in serbia . 
  we have \u010devap\u010dici but they are imported . 
  i do n't know what are the things that defines what is balkan and what is not . 
  in slovenia we have all saints day too ( november 1st ) . 
  halloween is becoming popular mainly in pubs and clubs . 
  there are some horror movies on tv and in cinema . 
  some people are putting pumpkins in front of their houses . 
  kids do n't dress in costumes . 
  we have `` pust '' for that . 
  austria , denmark , switzerland , germany, 
  it looks nice and peaceful . 
  the first 2 letters , before the shield sticker denote the region where the car was initially registered . 
  further division is made by the coat of arms of the corresponding city , placed after the regional area letters to define subdivisions . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vehicle_registration_plates_of_slovenia ), 
  not slovenia . 
  i feel so sorry for all the children . 
  sometimes it seems to me that they do n't really care that much about them . 
  i do n't understand why highly pregnant women want to go on a journey that can be dangerous for your baby and you . 
  if i would be pregnant i would just want to have a bed somewhere and rest . 
  is it really more important that you live in a country with the best standard or is it more important to safely deliver a baby ? 
  shopping malls are always full and cafes also . 
  it 's not so bad . 
  turbo folk music videos are hilarious . 
  we have numerous folklore groups all around slovenia . 
  popular is also so called `` narodno zabavna glasba '' or `` oberkrainer musik '' which was popularised a lot by slavko avsenik . 
  it was also very known in austria , germany , switzerland . 
  this music is popular in elder audience but also younger people do n't mind to dance to it on village parties ( so called veselica ) or weddings . 
  here is the most famous song from this genre . 
  [ ansambel bratov avsenik - na golici ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j00r4ymg7ac ), 
  well i spent lot of my holidays in croatia too . 
  we went there almost every year since i was born in 1989 . 
  so yes i know how it is . 
  it 's not unbearable . 
  sometimes we did n't wait at all . 
  even if he goes through slovenia he still needs to go to croatian highways especially if he goes to dalmatia but there is alternative : croatia `` old roads '' . 
  yes route will be slower but cheaper . 
  nazis everywhere ... 
  just a normal day in [ slovenia ] ( http://www.planet.si/imgs/g/1150x648/2015/34/022211jvw0d.jpg ) they filmed a movie here [ too ] ( http://www.planet.si/zabavno/novice-tv/v-srediscu-ljubljane-razobesene-nacisticne-zastave.html ) i think it 's not the same movie as is in czech republic . 
  well we do have caves https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_caves_in_slovenia but i did n't know that we are known for that . 
  and italy is france . 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  i understand that hospital is not in good condition but that does n't mean that it ca n't be clean . 
  he has slovenian wife . 
  otherwise i do n't think he is appropriate for a president . 
  we 're better than germany but it looks that does n't matter . 
  i like karel gott and his hand https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvgw7otutr4,
