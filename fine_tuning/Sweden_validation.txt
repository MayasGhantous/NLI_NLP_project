  also , i 'm talking from the point of view of the entire european geopolitical theatre rather than sweden . 
  in fact comparing a tiny nation to the world 's only superpower is pretty pointless , especially since sweden has been nominally neutral for over 200 years . 
  thanks for the links . 
  at least he did n't threaten to not honour american commitments to european allies . 
  how do you argue that an ally that has repeatedly puts its defense commitments in doubt and even threatens to remove their support altogether is n't unreliable ? 
  you ca n't deny that the current administration has done this to allies both in regards europe and south east asia . 
  mattis is right that europe - nato members or not - should increase their defense spending and not rely too much on unpredictable and unreliable allies like the united states . 
  but competent statesmen would apply this kind of pressure on their allies in talks behind closed doors rather than in front of the world and emboldening russia , especially right now with the russian revelations unfolding in washington . 
  no but if i had a copy of the iranian lawbook i could probably show you what applies to visitors . 
  and although foreign government representatives could refuse if they wanted to , they 're there to promote business cooperation , not antagonize their hosts . 
  what 's your point ? 
  we 're talking about diplomatic relations , not the justice system ? 
  iran has laws for what people should wear so it 's a matter of following the law , not assimilating to its culture . 
  iran has laws for what people should wear so it 's a matter of following the law , not assimilating to its culture . 
  proving my point . 
  they did n't follow custom , and the result was offending the host . 
  that 's a false equivalence . 
  first , diplomats are n't immigrants and second , why would we force anyone to take anything off ? 
  our laws do not dictate what people can wear . 
  and your assertion that `` iranian/muslim immigrants do n't remove their headscarves in sweden '' is n't 100 % true either as some actuality do because they 're free to do so . 
  as for iranian law , it requires women to cover their hair in some way and foreigners like these government representatives wear the minimum required scarves with plenty of hair showing while still conforming to diplomatic etiquette . 
  no , but observing basic customs of the host country is usually expected in diplomatic missions . 
  thank you , had to scroll down way too far to find people with some sense . 
  reddit loves circlejerking about sweden muslims and feminism . 
  this is n't feministiskt initiativ , these are members of government from socialdemokraterna and milj\u00f6partiet . 
  this is so stupid . 
  they swedish government is n't immigrating to iran , they 're on a diplomatic mission and we have important trade relations and social issues aside its good to have stable relations to one of he few actually stable states in the region . 
  yeah the mra/anti feminist angle factors into it . 
  nationalists tend to dislike anything that give women to many rights which distract them from their natural duty of producing pure children of course . 
  nationalists love masturbating to the idea of evil dark hairy foreigners raping pure nordic blonde women . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  elderly people are n't that much more conservative as far as i know . 
  there 's probably more of the '' * i do n't like it , but it 's really not my business either * '' sentiment than 100 % acceptance . 
  same goes for the very few religious people , our main ( formerly state ) church is very accepting as well . 
  social conservatism is just rare in sweden in general . 
  what ? 
  swedes have been open-minded about sex in general for decades , and tend to consider sexuality a very private thing . 
  giving a fuck about what two consenting adults do in private feels wierd . 
  we 've got the right to say that , internet time passes at least three times faster than regular time . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh01fkh8oia sorry for the quality , this is an ancient meme so handle with care . 
  it 's like how swedish nazis debate the anti-muslim party sweden democrats , which supports israel and has a few officials of jewish heritage or jewish relatives . 
  worth a vote to combat the immediate muslim threat or dangerously furthering the secret agenda of swedish zionists ? 
  a tough nut to crack for nazi top minds !, 
  those barbarians do not represent swedish pizza !, 
  traditional swedish pizza is made by middle eastern immigrants and [ looks like this ] ( http://kebabkungen.se/skovde/alpina/kp4/kp4.jpg ) . 
  thin crust , kebab , chicken or other meat , garlic sauce and a side of [ pizzasallad ] ( https://matmorsan.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dsc_1371.jpg ) . 
  if you 're really hungry , go ahead and add a [ whole bowl of sallad and some french fries on top ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d3nkkjc.jpg ) . 
  those pizzas are a crime against culinary law . 
  i 'm swedish and even i 'm offended . 
  no it 's worse than what they do to our neighbours , as well as the occasional nato detour through our airspace . 
  [ russia practiced nuking sweden a few years back ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/12139943/russia-simulated-a-nuclear-strike-against-sweden-nato-admits.html ) . 
  what he says is essentially '' * an authoritarian strongman is better than chaos . 
  * '' which is the foundation of legitimacy of dictators and poorly functioning democracies all over the world . 
  '' * without me there will be crime and terrorism , our nothing works , our country was once great and i will make it great again !, 
  * '' sound familiar ? 
  accountability is an important part of being a functioning democracy . 
  a system where politicians can and do vote to excuse themselves from corruption is evidence of a malfunctioning democracy . 
  89,3 % of all statistics are made up on the spot . 
   and no , russia wo n't invade gotland . 
  surely russia would n't invade georgia or ukraine either . 
  no one would have believed that , until it happened . 
  even if the probability is low , the problem is sweden almost abolished it 's defense after 1991 because `` russia will never be a threat again '' . 
  we do n't think russia will be aggressive towards us tomorrow , but in 5 years , 10 years ? 
  who knows . 
  and since building our defense takes time we have to be sceptic and prepare today . 
  same thing with our sweden democrats . 
  they vote pro-russia every occasion they get and recently had to fire a highly suspicious aide from russia , working under a swedish sounding pseudonym .

   illegaly occupied by ukraine and that 's where i stopped taking you seriously . 
   a referendum is pretty meaningless when held in an illegally seized territory under occupation, 
  * you * brought up nukes in response to a post where i said russia would most likely * not * use nukes 2 . 
  what the us did during ww2 in japan has little relevance to the geopolitical situation in the baltic sea 70 years later 3 . 
  russia * has * : - [ updated their nuclear doctrine to be more aggerssive ] ( https://www.csis.org/analysis/russia%e2%80%99s-nuclear-doctrine ) ; - [ directly threatened denmark with nukes ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-threatens-denmark-with-nuclear-weapons-if-it-tries-to-join-nato-defence-shield-10125529.html ) ; - [ practised nuclear bombing runs against sweden ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/12139943/russia-simulated-a-nuclear-strike-against-sweden-nato-admits.html ) . 
  i still do n't believe russia , or any other stable world power for that matter , would ever actually use nukes except in an end-of-the-world-scenario . 
  but it is undeniable russia is carrying out nuclear threats and posturing more aggerssively than the soviet union did after the cuban missile crisis . 
  a referendum is pretty meaningless when held in an illegally seized territory under occupation, 
   yeah but what about the us, 
  ... is not enough . 
  gotland is strategically important for the same reason . 
  you 're probably correct , but do you have a good source where i can read more about numbers relating to the geopolitical situation in europe please ? 
  not when talking about baltic security and stability specifically, 
  russia definitely wants access to the baltic sea and airspace . 
  and again , an invasion wo n't even happen from the start if they do n't believe benefits would outweigh the costs . 
  bleeding out an occupying force has been the strategy for both sweden ( although we were on the way of practically abolishing our defense since 1995 ) and finland since world war 2 . 
  even russia would face popular resistance from the costs of occupation and if there kept coming home caskets of dead soldiers , not to mention the effects of crippling sanctions . 
  what they 're facing in sanctions since crimea is pretty weak compared to fully freezing their foreign assets , not giving out visas and everything else the world could impose on them . 
  what 's your source for those numbers ? 
  is that 72 % of us spending counted as the usa : s total capacity , as nato commitments or as forces assigned specifically to europe ? 
  because those would make very different percentages .

  the title is very incorrect . 
  no one has died as a result of the riots .

  it 's still savage to throw rocks and set fire to cars . 
  people who throw rocks at police and set fire to cars are savages . 
  they are not savages because they come from another country , they are savages because they throw rocks and start fires .

  the thing is , even if we agree that society would be better off without violent porn , these laws are going to be completely ineffective . 
  there 's just no way to effectively stop it when it 's so widely available online . 
  it 's just gon na be the prohibition or the war on drugs all over again . 
  sweden already got rid of our `` 50 \u00f6re '' coin , which is roughly equivalent to 5 cents . 
  ca n't say i 've missed it at all . 
  so can we see those documents ? 
  it 's a secret . 
  they fly around north of scandinavia and then turn south . 
  nato has several functions and nordefco can replace some but not all of them . 
  the original point of being a member of nato is that the united states promise to use their 732 billion dollar defense budget to defend your country against a russian invasion . 
  nordefco ca n't provide that at all , so it ca n't really replace nato . 
  in peace-time areas like training , equipment and strategic development nordefco could replace a lot of what nato does , but the us still contributes with a lot of really useful stuff . 
  the nordic countries do n't have anywhere near the field experience that the us does , so discarding their input seems like it would hurt . 
  the third area , which i guess is your major reason for not wanting to be in nato , is the international policing stuff . 
  nordefco has no ambition to take part in that kind of stuff ( and we do n't have nearly enough resources to do so anyway ) . 
  to some extent , you could say that nato 's role here is just to increase the us military budget by 30 % . 
  i suppose that 's the price you pay for having their guaranteed backing if attacked . 
  my personal opinion regarding the last point is that some kind of world police is needed . 
  the un can not really fill this role because of its control structure . 
  no one will freely hand over the military forces they pay for to an organization they do n't control without some kind of reward . 
  optimally this organization should be controlled by a council of various countries where they get power in relation to their forces , with none of them contributing more than 10 % ( or even 5 % ) of the total . 
  it should be powerful enough to easily overpower any rogue countries or rebellions , in all areas of the world at the same time . 
  this would hopefully lead to a situation where starting wars is pointless in the first place because the world police would just come in and bust you . 
  it goes without saying that such a police force would currently be prohibitively expensive . 
  the only country really willing to pay for it seems to be the us , and that is why they 're currently running the only world police . 
  i would like to say that sweden should be willing too , but honestly i 'm not so sure that it 's worth it . 
  is it really worth trashing the welfare , education , health care and so on just to help other countries with the problems they caused themselves ? 
  right now it probably is n't , but in the future i hope it will be ( or rather , that we could afford to ) . 
  nato is not the only way to cooperate on defense . 
  sweden rely on getting help from nato countries , but it 's not like we do nothing in return . 
  we help them with a lot of military stuff , and in return we expect to be helped if attacked . 
  there are plenty of nato countries that spend equal or less amounts of their gdp on defense ( belgium , luxembourg , iceland , spain , hungary , albania ) and many others who only spend slightly more ( denmark , netherlands , norway , germany , czech republic , latvia , lithuania , romania and slovakia all spend 1.5 % or less ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure most of those countries contribute less to nato activities than sweden does and you are not only expected to help them , you are obligated to . 
  not sure if you 've heard of this concept called national sovereignty . 
  every country is allowed to decide for themselves what organizations and alliances they want to join . 
  norway have chosen to join nato but stay out of the eu . 
  they still function very well within the european community and take part in other treaties like schengen and others . 
  sweden instead chose to join the eu but stay out of nato . 
  instead of being a member of nato we 're just partnering with them in various ways . 
  according to [ this article on the official nato site ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_93853.htm ) the other members seem to be perfectly happy with the current arrangement . 
  i 'm gon na assume you 're swedish , so here 's the original basis for your quote :  i sverige fungerar luftbevakningens radarsystem , stridsledning och signalspaning dygnet runt . 
  i 'm not quite sure how dn managed to get that wrong . 
  how do they get to the uk without breaching national airspace ? 
  are they flying north of finland/norway or are they wiggling out from the baltic sea through the danish straits ? 
  we decided it was n't worth the money to keep a 24/7 readiness . 
  we have standby readiness parts of every day , exactly when and how much is secret . 
  to be fair , even though we 're not actual members of nato we still take part in a lot of combat exercises and actual missions like bosnia , kosovo , afghanistan and libya . 
  i 'm pretty sure we contribute more than our fair share given our relatively low population compared to countries like germany , france and the uk . 
  see [ sweden : one of nato 's most active and effective partners ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_93853.htm ) for some more information . 
  nato 's mission was n't to defend sweden . 
  nato responds to russian flights over the baltic sea on their own accord . 
  when the danish planes launched from lithuania they did n't know the destination of the russian planes . 
  even if sweden would have responded , nato 's planes would still have launched . 
  the response from sweden was very poor , but given the extremely low chance of an attack it does n't make economic sense to keep fighters ready for instant take-off 24/7 . 
  the flight from saint petersburg to stockholm only takes ~ 20 minutes at top speed so there is n't much time to scramble a response . 
  the only logical solution is that we instead rely on nato to defend us , and this obviously means we should be members of nato . 
  to a large extent we already are , as we take part of a lot of their exercises and missions in afghanistan , libya , etc. 
  actually formally joining nato is difficult to solve in terms of internal politics , politicians are n't willing to bet an election on something like that . 
  i 'm not saying clients would prefer seeing an illegal prostitute , i 'm saying most would stop going to prostitutes altogether . 
  the green party knows this , and it 's exactly what they want . 
  for someone that hires a prostitute twice a week on tuesdays and fridays and is completely open about it , getting a clean bill of health regularly would just be a nuisance . 
  however , this is n't the average client . 
  there are a lot of tourists and people who just do it every once in a while when they 're visiting frankfurt/berlin or something like that . 
  for these people setting up and going to a doctor 's appointment would be too high of a barrier . 
  there 's also still somewhat of a stigma associated with it . 
  a lot of people would be ashamed going to a doctor and saying `` i need a checkup because i 'm going to hire a prostitute '' . 
  this will effectively reduce legal prostitution by 99 % . 
  if they want to criminalize prostitution they should just say so instead of trying to hide it with something like this . 
  it 's dishonest .

  it 's also possible that countryside jobs like mining , foresting and farming is more physical and therefore attract more men . 
  this would be nice to have , but we 're at least 50 years from being able to afford it , and the money is currently better spent helping the third world .

   turned out that gramps had quite a collection of medals , but he had lost most of them since the only public recommendation he had valued in his life ( and the only one he ever displayed when alive ) had been a gold medal of the local farming society - i remember him saying that he did n't much appreciate how the society talked about him as a `` veteran '' , as he was in the army only for a few years in his youth , but he had been a farmer and a forester for almost five decades !,

  my grandfather fled to sweden before the war , his brother fought for germany . 
  edit : ok , let 's add to the story . 
  all this is third hand info , and maybe i dont ' remember it correctly . 
  grandfather was a fairly high official in the mecklenburg administration . 
  he was also member of the spd , and got into trouble in '33 ( moustaschy guy ) . 
  served jail time , but was released to help out with the administration . 
  i think it was concerning the hospitals . 
  he fled overnight to sweden with my grandmother from greifswald . 
  i would n't be surprised if she were a socialist/communist . 
  grandfathers brother i know even less about . 
  he was a paratrooper for germany , and i presume member of nsadp . 
  he survived the war , but the brothers did n't talk to each other until the 1980 's ( i think ) . 
  as far as i know they forgave each other - for fighting for the nazis and for abandoning the vaterland respectively - before the brother died . 
  i visited my dads cousins in germany as a kid . 
  we also use `` f\u00e4derneslandet '' , which is fatherland ( somewhat archaic spelling ) .

  it 's very tiresome arguing with you when you constantly start talking about things i 've never even said . 
  i was talking about the importance of being rigorous when it comes to interpreting european laws and not making exceptions to the left and right because `` we feel like it '' . 
  my second point is that i feel very strongly for the rights of everyone to speak their minds , and it baffles me that people do not realize that if they accept a society where some people ca n't express their views , they 're putting themselves in the line of fire also , because not everyone might think that * your * opinions are democratic/w/e ( do note that * i * never said you were though . ), 
  note that *** i 'm not discussing immigration policies *** so please , stop spitting immigration debate facts in my face , you 're in the wrong discussion . 
  why are you bringing the conversation away from the topic ? 
  we were not discussing swedish immigration policies . 
  i 'm not the one making the decision of such polices . 
  you do n't know whether i support them or not , which makes your fact-throwing in my face completely pointless . 
  god damn this is a tiresome opinion . 
  i argue my ass off with leftist friends to let nationalists in sweden voice their opinions without harrassments and death threats and shit , and then i 'm a nazi , and then i argue my ass off on the internet trying to tell people that no , just randomly expelling people because of a combination of their opinions and ethnicity ( oh i 'm sorry , * culture * , since apparently it 's okay to be prejudiced about culture and not ethnicity , idfk ) is n't a ) doable and b ) morally justifyable , then i 'm a weak ass not `` showing people what 's right '' and bla bla . 
  people are just the same shit to the left and right , narrowminded fucktards the lot of you . 
  maybe we should just dump all nationalists , islamists and leftist on a fucking island so i wo n't waste my energy trying to explain what the fuck democracy means . 
  show them how ? 
  because i totally said i was for open immigration ... how about arguing with things i 'm actually stating instead of things you * think * are my opinions based on generalizations ? 
  freedom only counts when it protects people with agreeable opinions !, 
  who cares ? 
  people who like things called `` laws '' and `` ethics '' like me ? 
  what the fuck 's wrong with people who lack moral rigor ? 
  the way i intepret it , these guys have been disruptive and sometimes aggressive in their persuasion attempts and should clearly be shown that that kind of behavior is hardly acceptable , but holy shit , you ca n't just walk through life just being `` i do n't like people like that , i do n't want them here ! '', 
  being morally rigorous is about having morals that are consistent and fair based on the situation , not this childish b.s. 
  you are spewing . 
  and no , do n't give me this `` do you like islamism/isis/terrorism !? '', 
  no , of course i do n't , but i do n't think having a retarded attitude to basic law and order is gon na help anyone fighting it . 
  walking around and handing out leaflets hardly motivates expelling . 
  / r/europe seems to have been a pretty weird mix of eu-optimism and stormfrontism ever since i joined like a month ago . 
  i usually try to steer clear of it now . 
  hey , do n't interrupt the circlejerk !, 
  well `` lucky '' is exactly how i 'd describe sweden , but one can definitely be happy over luck . 
  not that everything that 's good to sweden is due to luck , but i think our 200 years of peace can be ascribed to it . 
  the point about the uk and france being drawn into the conflict to guarantee polish security is not the complete truth , it was at this time apparent that nazi germany was a dangerous and expansive country that inevitably would pose a threat more serious to france and the uk than it was in 1939 . 
  the difference is though that both france and the uk had the power to enforce their own security policy through different means than sweden . 
  sweden was just a lucky bastard to never be invaded and did what i think was the most sane thing in order to stay out of it . 
  when it comes to canada , australia , and new zealand i do n't know really why they chose to participate , i have always just presumed it was because of their membership in the commonwealth . 
  [ something wrong ? 
  ] ( http://static.fjcdn.com/large/pictures/6c/26/6c2664_4984723.jpg ), 
  you just confused a volvo with a saab , are you sure you 're swedish ? 
  like * really * sure ? 
  can scania really be said to have been `` danish '' before 300 ad ? 
  germanic tribes in the southern half ( third ? ), 
  of the country , ish , probably finnic tribes along the coast of the northern parts , proto-sami hunter gatherers in the other areas . 
  this era also saw material and very possibly cultural changes influenced by the roman empire in the southern , germanic part . 
  during this period and the following migration period , religious centra seemed to shift from bogs and groves to temples . 
  people started building large halls , thrones , fortresses . 
  the variation in size of farm houses increased , the largest farm houses became larger , an indicator of increased social differences . 
  perhaps young men traveled to the roman empire to be hired as auxiliaries and came back with new influences and new attitudes towards society . 
  they had seen the centurions , generals , governors and heard about the emperor , they had seen a world where power came from individual , powerful men surrounded by a retinue of professional warriors , perhaps it was a slower , more ` seeping ' process that radiated from the germanic lands closer to the roman border , but possibly it was a combination . 
  runes were first used probably in the borderlands between the roman empire and germania and would in time spread to scandinavia . 
  the runic alphabet is almost a copy of the [ old latin alphabet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duenos_inscription ) . 
  so in general , a `` latinization '' of the scandinavian culture was going on , kind of how the 20th and 21st centuries are heavily `` americanized '' . 
  it was n't an assimilation or simple `` copying '' of latin culture , but latin culture was absorbed , combined , interpreted and fused with already existing customs into a new culture , and this culture would later `` give birth '' to the germanic cultures of the migration period and viking age . 
  which is pretty fucking sad . 
  you lose your ethnic identity once you do n't live up to a massive , negative stereotype ? 
  ah the space buses . 
  i turn into a giggly little girl every time i get a chance to ride one . 
   long answer : homosexuality was once socially unacceptable and thus it was punishable . 
  it became socially unacceptable due to multiple reasons and thus it was no longer punishable . 
  that 's my point , why should my individual freedoms be at the whim of the majority ? 
  this is more of a question of principle for me , either you let the majority decide for the rest what 's okay and what is n't , * or * you have a base set of rights that not even the majority can affect , no matter how much they hate it . 
   so , individual rights should be guarded and protected . 
  why are n't you protecting/guarding my right to threaten someone with death ? 
   there 's a boundary of individual freedom that should be guarded , and that boundary stops at displaying isis flags . 
  displaying an isis flag is legally and logically not a death threat , and saying that it is * kind of * a death threat since isis are extremists is not a proper motivation . 
  the problem is also that you assume that there 's always an easy answer to what is extremism and what is n't . 
  people in europe are already pointing fingers to the left and right and identifying `` fascists '' sometimes amongst the ranks of nationalists , sometimes islamists , sometimes left-wingers . 
  this is a dangerous development . 
  what happens when a relatively large nationalist movement - say the bnp in the uk for instance - is labeled `` extremists '' ? 
  then the voice of a relatively large portion of society becomes silenced just because the majority is uncomfortable with their opinions . 
  and what if we turn the scenario around , and nationalist hardliners all across europe gain more ground and * they * start deciding what is extremism and what 's not ? 
  i could easily imagine the feminist party of sweden being labeled `` extremist '' by a hard-line nationalist movement , and so would many of the far left-wing parties . 
  and will it stop there ? 
  how do we know that the definition of `` extremism '' wo n't start to creep into the political mainstream ? 
  are n't the social democrats of sweden extremists in the eyes of nationalists because of their vigorous defense of a liberal immigration policy and opinion that nationality and ethnicity are nothing but social constructs ? 
    besides , i 'd say waving any symbol i 'd like is freedom of speech . 
   and we 'd say it 's not . 
  then what * is * freedom of speech according to you ? 
    ... one could also easily reason that the suppression of their rights to express themselves will further radicalize them and make them paranoid , increasing the risk of terrorist attempts by them . 
   that 's funny because none of their rights is being suppressed . 
  that 's funny because you assume they think like you . 
  besides , i 'd say waving any symbol i 'd like is freedom of speech . 
  ... one could also easily reason that the suppression of their rights to express themselves will further radicalize them and make them paranoid , increasing the risk of terrorist attempts by them . 
  i 'd say , let them say what they want to say , but it 's the security police 's duty to keep any groups potentially dangerous to national security under surveillance . 
  as long as they 're not planning to cause any harm , let them throw their fits . 
  getting angry at someone you disagree with does n't motivate a ban , not to mention deporting european isis supporters to syria would not be a good idea , since many are not even * from * syria , it 's just dumping a european problem on the undeserving syrian civilian population . 
  i also think isis are fucking cunts , the whole lot of em , and it baffles me how anyone would want to support them . 
  still , temperance is a virtue , and i think it 's good to remain true to the moral principles of democracy and liberty . 
  yup , probably rural tribal societies in the southern 3rd of the country , and hunter-gatherers in the remaining area . 
  democracy in the modern sense ( and the original commenter , / u/alanlolspan explicitly said `` liberal democracy '' ) does n't mean `` mob rule '' . 
  individual freedoms * must * be respected and guarded , that 's what freedom of speech i all about . 
  afaik , the netherlands also has freedom of speech . 
  democracy is n't supposed to be convenient or comfortable for the masses , that 's easy to do . 
  most societies in the world accept differing opinions within a certain spectrum .

  oh , and its geographically close to almost everything . 
  looks like the old plan to me . 
  well , that was a waste of 29 seconds . 
  if it 's not a problem , and for germany it is not , then it is not a problem . 
  so , no . 
  meh , no difference for most people then . 
  they will probably not survive anywhere outside of the university/twitter . 
  thats why you never see them in the real life . 
  europe has no unity , putin is just showing it . 
  haha , like the french would allow that . 
  where are you from ? 
  lol , eu-funds . 
  the kid you are discussing with is a convinced left wing 16 year old who constantly goes out of his depth on r/sweden , just so you know . 
  because you are . 
  [ lie ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/lie ) . 
  never . 
  oh , are you back ? 
  go lie somewhere else . 
  and killing you could free up enough resources to feed someone else , what is your point ? 
  lol , you have no case , you have lost it . 
  the left is as disgusting as it has always been . 
  in the well functioning european countries we actually like the uk . 
  it is meh . 
  g\u00e4rdet as an area is pretty large with lots of greenery . 
   there is no censorship going on . 
  and there are no american soldiers in bagdad , right ? 
  what a useless statement . 
  yeah , high taxes drove them away . 
  you must be a troll . 
  its not fucking understandable , stop treating them like children . 
  not going to happen . 
  how about fists ? 
  they can be abused too . 
  you are wrong . 
  stop crying and accept that . 
   there are also smaller stores which have a minimum sale requirement before they accept cards , because of fees . 
  iirc , minimum sale requirements are not legal . 
  but still predominantly capitalist . 
  thus , we are all capitalist , mate . 
  lol, 
  well , name one economy that is not in some way mixed . 
  we are predominantly capitalist . 
  yeah no , we are all capitalist mate . 
  why would greece care ? 
  schengen is dying anyway . 
  haha , no . 
  haha , what does that even mean ? 
  i do n't mind lillebror . 
   how come swedish citizens want to support such things ? 
  they do n't , they are more or less being scared into submission . 
  swedish , but it is debatable . 
  wow, 
  you could always move to open somalia . 
  tough shit . 
  we also have both actually, 
  because its pretty much the only thing legitimising the existance of the eu in the eyes of the public at this point . 
  well , no shit, 
  lol , you lefties are nuts . 
  meh , who cares . 
  i highly doubt that . 
  what , you mean something like [ this ? 
  ] ( http://c85c7a.medialib.glogster.com/media/83/837f13afb8b744e6b089e24a21bb1fb701fe11e0be833e0793299161183c5a4e/yggdrasil.jpg ), 
  lack of resources limiting the available recruitment slots . 
  it is true . 
  no , its not his style . 
  better than russia . 
  nope . 
  the greeks want more money , thats basically it . 
  lol, 
  wrong game . 
  little brother complex !, 
  its a way to get rid of the left who created the situation . 
  are you retarded ? 
  the crisis is self inflicted , sweden has no right to demands others to fix it for them . 
   it will be disappointing to see schengen suspended . 
  meh , you 'll just have to bring a passport . 
  who cares . 
  good , maybe they can get their shit together finally . 
  no , we should make staying in europe a more attractive option . 
  after you . 
  fucked up , even . 
  are they rich too ? 
  what a bunch of cunts !, 
  dont they know that greece completely fucked itself over and should just be magically given money from everyone else who did not fuck their country over ? 
  pretty much . 
  no , but i dont mind his existance !, 
  oh look , someone is jealous !, 
  my understanding is that this was said as a joke , not something he actually wants . 
  lol, 
  wow , a whole 5 minutes ? 
   if people say that we should n't help refugees because there are violent persons among them , they are naive as well . 
  that 's not naivety , that 's recognizing the there is a tradeoff and picking a side . 
  you spineless shit , / u/low _ discrepancy completely ran over you , own up to it . 
  politically correct zombies did see it , but they deemed the threat of people getting killed like this to be worth it to further their cause . 
  some parts of the world are more important than others . 
  are you joking or are you just an average american ? 
  what you mean is , 30-40 % who are `` xenophobic '' , 40-50 % who are ignorant/uninterested and 5-10 loud , influential per cent who are pro multiculturalism . 
  just be aware , they arent as independent in their reporting as they are paid to be . 
  itt : jealous eastern europeans being overly proud of the eu because joining it is their only major achievement in the last 100 years . 
  neither country has u-turned yet .

  cant wait until eu catch up to swedish food safety regulations , local farmers are getting destroyed by competing european farmers . 
  what ? 
  the only thing in common between all horrible and great organised societies in history is that they all hate anarchists . 
  there is plenty of reasons to dislike anarchists , the biggest reason must have to be that they promote anarchy and that makes them pretty much everyone 's enemy and not in the highschooler sense . 
  we hate fascists and nazis for less . 
  or maybe thats the reverse reverse !, 
  its for consistency , if you stop denouncing an action then it becomes a silent acceptance . 
  its the sphere of influence , a northern baltic alliance has stronger influence over the baltics , if the baltics have an alliance they have stronger influence over russian minorites bordering russia . 
   the only thing this would serve is flooding europe with cheap chinese food and other low value products . 
  which is great , it would also allow better export to china , as a smaller `` quality oriented '' country ( sweden ) , china is a fantastic market because their upperclass in pure numbers pretty big , and insanely rich , and anything branded `` made in sweden '' sells like butter , even if it is overpriced , for chinese middle-upperclass image is everything , and swedish brands are hothothot, 
  which is interesting because it competes with swedish nuclear power which is not subsidized at all and taxed super heavily because it is too efficient . 
  so which one is it ? 
  keyword : `` stable full-time job '', 
  well then , welcome aboard . 
  just remember that it will limit how much you can work on government contracts , especially as someone working with encryption . 
  its pretty bad up here too , in fact most countries is pretty bad if you are an average or below average in any category . 
  now as a white person going to china , maaan thats like paradise over there, 
  well you are in luck , we live in the best timezone for competitive gaming !, 
  and normal games too !, 
  the easy part is we have brits and dutch people who are excellent at english , the rest are hit or miss but its much more fun to play with dutch people than it is with americans, 
  this also means that since you dont have to fit in you will fit in perfectly !, 
  not at all as big of a problem, 
  well technically not 87 % swedes because you need to consider those ineligable to vote and also the blank/minority votes . 
  so 57 % of swedes voted exactly for this , then you also have to consider that this wasnt that big of a problem in 2014 , it is in 2015 that all this stuff has spiked edit : hah downvoted for doing actual maths . 
  we are talking about freedom of speech , not the press , the press is fully capable of suppressing the freedom of speech . 
  you get a grip , you seem to underestimate the power of the media . 
  so we have this new thingy they need to vote for , lets look up the the people that disagree with our view and find some dirt on them , then we go ask them to change their mind , if they dont we fling the dirt out for everyone to see . 
  another example is selective bias , what you dont know about cant make you feel bad , so what they do is they filter out things that doesnt help your agenda , every news outlet does this in the world . 
  its just that in sweden the people in direct power may not align 100 % with the media this is very simplified but if you dont see how this is a thing happening right now you are truly blind, 
  they do have media power , and in 2016 owning the media means owning the public opinion which is where real power is . 
  great attempt att bringing nothing into the conversation . 
  nobody said anything about any government . 
  i have lived a summer in 38\u00bac while in china , i wore shoes outdoors and took them off when i got home and i changed socks every day , my shoes smelled fine , feets were clean and the floor didnt get dirty . 
  so ... if i can do it and it works for everyone who does it , shouldnt it work for mediterranean people as well ? 
  thats why you wear socks and change them every day , problem solved, 
   vacuum and mop their floors every once in a while , which you were going to do anyway like once a year thing because the floor doesnt get dirty if you only wear socks in anyway , we take our shoes off , we dont have smelly feet , our shoes smells great and our floors are clean , meanwhile you dont take your shoes off , your shoes smell , your feet smell and your floors are dirty . 
  if you think it is a nobrainer to leave your shoes on then probably you are a little too literal in how you use `` nobrainer '', 
   quite a claim . 
  indeed , most if not all people i know who moved abroad did it because it is much easier as a young educated person to find jobs down on the continent and elsewhere . 
  also cleaning fish in norway pays great !, 
  you havent met the left in sweden , its not exactly the rightwing people who promote the idea of a `` nationwide '' register of potential racists and sexists , they are also really eager to hang out people first and ask questions later . 
  * something about leftist media being over-represented in sweden * i mean , you cant say anything that is anywhere critical of how we are handling refugee current without being labeled a nazi in front of practically everyone in sweden . 
  it is pc-fascism , but it has evolved into poe 's law levels . 
  in sweden , we also drive heck of a lot more , we have a pretty good per capita safety , how do you explain that ? 
  also done on fucking ice roads . 
   market economy well , neither is the us then i guess :| the only difference is that in china the party rules the corporation , in the us the corporations rules the party , neither is a free market if you want to be picky and consistent . 
  sweden is still the same country : o, 
  not even the us have 1 `` army '' , they have 5 branches that works pretty independently from each other because it is more practical and secure , in the same way it wouldnt make sense to make just 1 branch in eu/europe , it would make sense to put it in smaller groups , the norbalt states could have a common navy in the same way we could have a mediterranean or atlantic navy, 
  love the idea of a negative income tax, 
  cant have the cookie and eat it . 
   it would numb your mouth and throat if it contained any good amount of cocaine . 
  so like the 10 cups of coffee a day ? 
  this puts it all into perspective really, 
  look , you seem to have problems with the english language , but for safety 's sake , that burn is a meme ( look under what a meme is ) , the second sentence was merely pointing out that rafale would soon not be the only one down there doing mission without counter electronic warfare support . 
  if you think this is a macho reply then maybe you got some problems reading english . 
  i know i would n't have gotten a cae with that level of reading comprehension . 
  its always scary !, 
  you never know , maybe trolls are real afterall !, 
  ( no but seriously , dead silence and a cracking noise in a pitch black forest ? 
  i dont care what is out there , my lizard brain tells me to run like hell, 
  * hon hon hon mr tough guy * has found his way into reddit . 
   `` the only aircraft capable of conducting bombing runs in libya without need for dedicated electronic warframe aircraft protecting them '' . 
  still might be true as well or should we continue compare totally unrealistic hypothetical scenarios , what about a normal guerilla war in southern chinas jungle ? 
  `` warm and comfy '' typically means 13 degrees inside . 
  it gets pretty warm up here in the summer , like 30 ~ degrees whole july if we are lucky/unlucky never experienced any of that `` comfy '' feeling you are describing . 
  nope , you can not be stripped of your citizenship by the state at all , the only way to get rid of a swedish citizenship is to give it up yourself . 
   personally i think it would be better to reinstate the death penalty . 
  no need to let murderers live . 
  but you do realize that there exist wrongfully convicted people that get executed still today in 2015 ? 
   also - no need for the fucking nazi shit . 
  grow up . 
  look , that nazi shit is exactly why you cant rip someone of their citizenship , because bad stuff has happened when you allowed a state to do that , and all it takes is for someone to convince enough other stupid sheep that someone like you ( / u/anonymityillusion for instance ) is a terrorist and his social group and voila !, 
  you are stripped of citizenship and sent off to a gulag in god knows where . 
  how do i know this ? 
  because it literally ( no hyperbole here either ) happened 75 years ago , in europe . 
  there is a great quote that is used and abused `` those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat i '' , this is a very very very prime example of things that would be topical in that quote . 
  nope you can not , even with two citizenships , a swedish citizen can not give up their citizenship either unless he has two citizenships . 
   otherwise i do n't see why they were n't stripped of it . 
  its in our constitution that you can not get stripped of your swedish citizenship , why ? 
  because i think you are a terrorist , thats why , also because we went through this once in the late 30s , early 40s . 
   as far as the eye can see !, 
  thats the problem with our forests up here , you could probably only see 10 meters into it then it is just darkness that consumes you, 
  that burn !, 
  but soon gripen might be going down there for some action , probably no bombing though , mostly recon, 
  the title says ` lombardy ** bans ** the burqa and niqab ' which lacks highly relevant contextual information . 
   the world 's best militaries is what you said , you just mentioned countries . 
  i mean where is the facts ? 
   nice of you to mention sweden , i assume you 're aware that they 've ended conscription there [ 1 ] ? 
  yes and we have lost all wars since 2010, 
  norway was also in a union under sweden during 1800s, 
  i see ... do we have any historical evidence for this ? 
  vietnam successfully defended in 2 wars with conscription . 
  they also invaded another country successfully . 
  russia is a running a quite successful military , and they do conscription . 
  sweden has basically had conscription for 1000 years or more in some way or another and that has worked quite well even the all mighty america had one kind of conscription not too long ago , but now they have a poverty problem so you dont really need it . 
   the world 's best militaries are the ones where it 's volunteers serving as a career , not everyone in a given age bracket serving whether they want to or not . 
  and your supporting evidence is ? 
  sweden has never been truly `` neutral '' in the sense you are suggesting, 
  swedish statistical bureau proved that salary difference based on genders is either a ) non existant or b ) impossible to prove without specifically investigating every single persons career decisions and lifetime behaviour , which would be impractical/wishful thinking . 
  basically they did a qualitative study of tens of thousands of people and decided the difference in salary might as well be motivated by star signs because the amount of people with identical backgrounds , doing identical jobs of two genders was really really rare and in the cases where people had the same gender the salary fluctuated more than you would think ( like 3 % ) so basically it is all unscientific assumptions that there is a gender bias on that particular front ( salaries ),

  that 's it really , it 's not a long song . 
  i do hope you learned the dance as well ? 
  you have to do the dance . 
  but what 's surreal about it ? 
  do n't you have any silly children 's songs in poland ? 
  do n't know about most competent , that 's difficult to rate and they were all very competent , but probably most famous . 
  he 's accredited for spearheading the invention of the v-2 rocket , then leading the team behind the redstone rocket , and overseeing a bunch of other stuff . 
  but they all did stuff , many became directors of their own branches . 
  there were n't many branches of the us rocket program without a german in charge . 
  and just to clarify , nasa was n't really * founded * by germans , they just ran a lot of it . 
  because no one did rocketry quite like the germans in the mid-1900s . 
  a lot of countries are great at engineering . 
  germany 's reputation comes from several things . 
  lots of people = large workforce and large pool to draw great engineers from . 
  early adaptors and great emphasis on education and making it universally accessible . 
  good quality control across the board , whereas many other countries had some independent shoddy companies lowering the impression of said country 's product quality . 
  `` made in germany '' , was therefore a mark denoting `` great quality '' . 
  `` germanic '' work ethics : you go to work to work , not to socialize etc. 
  but , yes , germany certainly has an amazing history in engineering . 
  but i do n't have any , so do n't you put this on me . 
  but if i did , who would i give it to ? 
   and ofc [ this gem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxut5trtiwa ) - like wtf sverige - how can this be one of your national songs ? 
  brutal do n't know what would make it a ` national song ' , it 's just a traditional song for kids and drunk people for midsummer celebrations . 
  it comes from a [ french military march ] ( https://youtu.be/ye70jrhorjk?t=25s ) . 
  the britons did n't think it was very imposing for some unknown reason , and condescendingly made fun of them changing the lyrics to ` au pas , grenouilles ' . 
  somehow that ended up in sweden and became a child - and drunk people favorite . 
  but you ca n't just listen to it , you have to do the dance , ~ ~ preferably ~ ~ drunk !, 
  that version you linked is weird though . 
  they 've added lyrics i 've never even heard before . 
  hats and pants , wtf is that about ? 
  ears and tails , and then you switch to pigs . 
  over 1600 germans scientists and engineers were brought over for operation paperclip . 
  many of which continued to nasa when that was founded in '58 and even more joined later . 
  the list goes on and on , the germans * made * nasa ... essentially . 
  that is true . 
  but if i were to play the devil 's advocate , i 'd say it 's not as much as ` refusing ' to give it back , as it is logistically difficult to do so . 
  - it 's over 360 years ago , both victims and offenders have been gone for generations . 
  the lines of inheritance are long broken , so who 's the rightful owner of today ? 
  with neither people nor country in a direct line of inheritance , who do you `` give it * back * '' to ? 
  there is no `` back '' . 
  if you die , and i take your television for a while , what gives your completely unrelated countryman any claim to it ? 
  of course one can argue it 's not rightfully mine , but whose is it ? 
  - and since the offenders are long gone , how can it be forced on today 's swedes ? 
  is it right for someone in 350 years to pay for a crime you commit today ? 
  the state of sweden does n't own them , they 're in the hands of museums and private collectors , all who 've acquired them legally . 
  a fair share have been donated back in good faith , but there 's no compensation for doing it . 
  and the state ca n't force the current owner to do so . 
  would you give up your house for free because someone came and made a claim the plot of land was stolen sixteen generations ago ? 
  - how do we even know which items were stolen and which were received legally ? 
  sweden and poland-lithuania did trade . 
  60 years before the deluge we were even in a personal union . 
  - and a lot of the items have also been lost with time . 
  so while `` most of these items have never been returned to poland '' is technically correct , it 's impossible to return them as they no longer exist . 
  a fair share has been donated in good faith , but it 's not possible to do that with `` most '' since they 're gone . 
  now i 'm not saying it 's right , the deluge is undoubtedly one of the darkest things about my country 's past , but how would you go about returning things ? 
  it 's not just a matter of `` here , you take it '' or ` refusing ' to do so . 
  how can a legal owner of an item be forced to give it away without compensation , and to whom ? 
  not really any outright threats , but the occasional military aircraft and submarine infringes on our territory . 
  there really is n't any legitimate excuse for them being there other than showing off their guns . 
  they 've also simulated nuclear attacks on sweden and such in war games . 
  ^ ( ^ edit : ^ typo ), 
  ca n't say i 've ever heard of such a thing , no . 
  we have a similar thing here since historically the populated parts were * effectively * disconnected in a similar way . 
  but when we 're talking about it , it 's ` down on '' * the continent * '' ' never `` europe '' . 
  we always see ourselves part of `` europe '' , but not part of `` the continent '' . 
  that refers to the historical ` mainland europe ' , the landmass traversable without boats . 
  edit : just to add , the swedish definition of ` continent ' is n't exactly the same as english . 
  ` europe ' is never a `` kontinent '' in swedish , it 's a `` v\u00e4rldsdel '' ( world-part ) . 
  ` eurasia ' is a `` kontinent '' . 
  so there is n't any ambiguity with ` europe ' being a continent . 
  the largest dictionary is probably `` svenska akademiens ordbok '' . 
  work on it started 1786 , but it 's still not complete . 
  they are now 37 volumes in but have eight letters left to go through . 
  i think it has about 500000 words now . 
  that 's honestly a lot better than i expected , thought i 'd butchered the spelling completely . 
  it was like 10 years ago i learned it from a classmate from greenland . 
  but yeah , that is all what i thought i said . 
  ` asavakkit ' is however less similar to ` akvavit ' than i remember ... og godt svensk !, 
  qujan is all i can say , unless i was lied to and it 's just bullshit . 
  and i 'm pretty sure i misspelled some things though . 
  `` i love you '' also remind me of ` akvavit ' , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was . 
  ` asakvakit ' or something ? 
  the thirty years ' war started in 1618 , 399 years ago . 
  martin luther wrote the 95 theses exactly 500 years ago , so there were n't many protestants to be unfriendly towards . 
  they do not . 
  cze\u015b\u0107 to you too , kolega !, 
  thanks . 
  haha , touch\u00e9 . 
  i was really just pulling your leg  you are correct . 
  but why do you even call it `` swede '' anyway ? 
  you could 've just used our word instead of naming it the exact same thing as us . 
  the americans managed to do that , even if they somehow got a weird dialectal word . 
  unlike them you could just use the normal `` k\u00e5lrot '' . 
  `` k\u00e5l '' means ` cabbage ' , so if you find the letter ' \u00e5 ' too difficult just call it `` cabbage rot '' . 
  much better . 
   ^ ( ( edit : ` rot ' means ` root ' , if you for some reason wondered what k\u00e5lrot acually meant . 
  it 's `` cabbage-root '' . 
   the corsican constitution is the oldest constitution in the world depends on definitions . 
  `` constitution '' simply means `` constitution '' , and there are as many different definitions as there are countries . 
  the first thing that cam be referred to as the `` constitution of sweden '' came in 1634 for example and i 'm sure there are older than that .

  again , not news , just failure to see the writing on the wall . 
  not exclusive to southern europe though , by all means . 
  but still , it was and is well known that the euro is very imperfect currency area and that the euro would be to expensive for the greeks . 
  i very much remember the arguments around our euro vote , and one of the main argument against the euro was that it would never be adjusted to our economy . 
  obviously that argument holds for everyone really ( apart from germany ) . 
  but , the reason we said no were more suspiscion against rest of europe , not any intelligence around economics btw . 
  so , that the euro would be to expensive was well known . 
   a lower productivity is not necessarily wrong , it 's the sign of certain types of economic activity . 
  yes , but greece has lower productivity on stuff they make too . 
  and , for anyone that has studied economics , it is not smart to build a whole economy on tourism and services . 
  while one can enjoy it while it lasts , it is not a sure thing ( nothing is really ) . look at thailand , they are trying like hell to diversify . 
  that is why i ask what greece for example have been doing for the last 30-40 years . 
  anyone with an economic background can tell you it is good to diversify a tad , and not put all your eggs in one basket , in particular if that basket is agriculture and tourism . 
  look at estonia , and poland . 
  they are trying to build up industries . 
  why have n't we seen more of that in the last 30 years in southern europe ? 
  that is one of the big question that i have been asking , and i would very much to know who is responsible for that . 
  had southern europe bothered to do that , they would not be in the situation that they are in . 
  greece has been in the eu since 81 , and i do not think they are on their way to become net contributors . 
  i think the estonia will be net contributors in 20 years , maybe poland too . 
  that is because they have dealt with their situation completely different . 
  however , you do not want to see that . 
  you are refusing to accept responsibility . 
  you do not even think that people in a democracy are responsible for their own elected government . 
  the problem is , until you guys actually accept your part of responsibility for the situation southern europe is in , it will never change . 
  change is not nice , but it is necessary for everyone . 
  and that involves accepting ones part . 
  however , looking at the way you are arguing you are just refusing to accept any of it . 
  you are not even admitting that the italians are responsible for berlusconi . 
  since people like you seem to be far to many , i fear for the future of southern europe . 
  i ca n't change you , but i can influence how my country acts . 
  and my advice is - stay away until they actually prove that they are attempting to change . 
  fight integration , because that would mean integrating with people like you , who refuse change , refuse to accept responsibility . 
   i have already answered you , no you have not . 
  you have not said , at all who is responsible for the state of southern europe . 
  i know you said that the southern europeans were * not * responsible for their democratically elected government ( a statement i find moronic btw ) but then who is ? 
  who elected the governments then , if not the southern europeans ? 
  who is responsible for the corruption in southern europe if not the southern europeans . 
  you are not answering that , and i guess it is because you are a coward . 
   your question itself is loaded . 
  no , it is n't - only if you are someone who is afraid of the answer . 
  for normal , non cowards it is a normal question , we ask it all the time . 
  `` who is responsible for the outfishings of the oceans '' ? 
  `` who is responsible for the crappy housing situation in stockholm ? '' . 
  that is what adults and responsible people do , one a ) ask what is wrong b ) then who is responsible . 
  that is part of the process of fixing things . 
  the very fact that you do not even * want * to talk about responsibility and is avoiding it like the plague tells me that you are not a responsible adult who is interested in fixing things . 
  you just want to make sure , at all costs , that southern europe is not made responsible for the mess in southern europe ...  1 . 
  southern europe has wasted eu funds . 
  southern europe is corrupt beyond solution and we all must be blame its people for it . 
  southern europe should become more productive ( cool let 's move all beach resorts to rheinland and its industry to mallorca ) are those things wrong then ? 
  what is wrong with southern europe becoming more productive and less corrupt ? 
  btw , it is you who added beoyond salvation and , moving to the rhineland , but that is just your idiotic assumptions and made up stories again . 
  it is odd , it is you that accuse me of lies , yet you are the irresponsible person who makes stuff up . 
   i have debated all those points , but you keep asking the same questions over and over , showing that you just do n't give a fuck about any fact it 's presented to you . 
  facts ? 
  i know about the funds , but you have not given me any facts about corruption and how to fix it . 
  you just called me a liar , when i proved you wrong , you changed the subject . 
  fact is that southern europe is corrupt , pay far less in taxes , are not a net contributor and far less productive . 
  that is nothing to debate about that , and at least you are intelligent enough to change the subject when i prove you wrong , again and again . 
  i think southern europe should stop being corrupt , and become productive , pay taxes and become a net contributor . 
  but , to do that one has to be responsible . 
  you have proven , over and over again , that it will take a long time . 
  grow the fuck up and realise that no one but you put yourself in the spot where you are . 
  you caused it , now fix it , with your own money . 
  hmm , we need to be cunning . 
  soon it is christmas , at least part of the plan has to involve bribing them with butter . 
  also , building several ullareds close to norway , lure them in and then not let them out . 
   can we agree that countries should either observe the rules they set for themselves or try to change the rules in a consensus-seeking manner ? 
  well , yes , of course , i agree with you there . 
  either follow the rules , or try to change them , through the proper channels , whatever they are . 
  however , that is not what has happened in the eu and that is harming the whole union . 
  i mean , it is not like belgium said , `` hmm , 60 % debt/gdp , that is to low , let us change that '' , they just joined and no one gave a shit . 
  no observing or no trying to change it . 
  now it is just a `` free for all '' . 
  and that annoys the hell out of me , in particular since i know that it is harming the eu . 
  i would be fascinated only if it happened in afrcia/asia or somewhere else , but this is costing everyone time and money . 
  now i am annoyed and morbidly fascinated . 
  also , i 'd like to add that * if * one do not obsever the rules one should get punished . 
  well , yes and my stepfather built something around a few trees , the ones closest . 
  but the house was on a small hill , and it was a green grassy meadow down to the lake . 
  to the left though ( also belonging to the house ) was a small gathering of birch trees , looking sort of like [ this ] ( http://ekuriren.se/image_processor/1.780811.1282081290!/image/1304158467.jpg_gen/derivatives/full/1304158467.jpg?maxwidth=468 ) . 
  it was rather pretty , you could see the lake throught the trees as well . 
  after the beavers had been there , it looked like someone had played a giant game of spillikin . 
  not the worst thing that could happen , but mother did try to save some trees . 
  beavers do not like dogs ... 
  the united states is one country . 
  we are not . 
  thus we should not try a unified currency without the other mechanisms in place . 
  you are again not answering questions . 
  and , again - what did i lie about ? 
  you are the liar , while accuses me and make wild assumptions . 
  all the time refusing to answer . 
  i have proven everything - i am not making stuff up like you are . 
  so , for fuck sake . 
  grow some balls and answer questions . 
  who is responsible for the state in southern europe if not the southern europeans ? 
  you never answered that but try to mix it up with starting to babble about agriculture . 
  cheap trick and it does n't work . 
  so , stop being spineless and answer .

  and have been doing since forever . 
  why ca n't they pay for their own roads ? 
  for how many more decades are the north permanently going to transfer money to the south ? 
  a federation would just make that transfer bigger , and more permanent . 
   but somehow i don \u00b4 t think that is a very popular idea or even conceivable today . 
  i 'd vote no at least , but i agree with you , they have to do something . 
  however , until that time , i hardly think the solution is a currency union completely without rules . 
  it is fascinating to watch though . 
  extremely happy that we are not in it . 
   they promised that the deficit would be falling . 
  ok , remembered wrong then . 
   the debt is not likely to go anywhere unless the economy grows . 
  but is n't the debt * supposed * to be falling ? 
  or have the euro countries just given up on the rules completely and decided to have a currency union without rules . 
  i find the latter rather fascinating . 
  not even a kilt on a warm summers eve in scotland/ireland ? 
  i have seen prince charles wearing them ... . . skirts are the best , far more airy than shorts . 
  and i have nice legs too , so it works . 
  so poland , slovakia , sweden and austria ? 
  i thought germany has been doing well too . 
  estonia ? 
  well , those that i have seen goes away to areas i ca n't see and have at least plastic hanging over and touching them . 
  then they start at a moments notice , and they have bags on them that fall over . 
  some of them sort of go down as well . 
  i mean , i do not think the mother murdered her child , but i 'd rather put my baby ( do n't have one , but my niece/nephew ) on my shirt on the floor in a corner ( at that age one always carries a baby bag i think , so one can change on them outside of the home with a blanket thingie they can lie on ) , and stand over them , than on the baggage carousel . 
  or , one just holds on to them , no matter how much they scream or smell , until you can put them down safely , even if the whole airport hates you . 
  i have done that at least , but in a store . 
  but i do not want to put them on something where they all of a sudden can disappear from me . 
  that is the biggest no no i can think of . 
  a screaming child is an alive child , silence and gone is far worse . 
   but an imperfect market situation . 
  true , my answer was a bit simplistic , i admit to that . 
  the supply demand is due to the imperfect market . 
   but , at long term , these benefits would attract new suppliers , thus creating a new equilibrium . 
   then : a ) not enough time has elapsed for new suppliers to enter the market , b ) every year there 's always an unpredictable increase of demand , c ) a monopolistic situation/barriers to the market exist . 
  or a little bit of all them , right ? 
  a bit of all i 'd say . 
  it is an imperfect market , as in you have to be a brewery within the city of munich to sell at the oktoberfest . 
  not that easy market to enter . 
  also , it only goes on for 16 days , which increases the demand , and the audience who pays for the beer might not be the same audience who pays for the beer at the local pub in schwabing . 
  sort of like we all have been guilty for paying x number of money more for an expensive coffee near a landmark ( spanish stairs , trafalgar square or just anything ) while a five minutes walk probably would have brought us better and cheaper coffee . 
  however , we want to sit there and look at times square and pretend we live there , so we pay more . 
  i guess one includes the image too . 
  ( and oktoberfest is really fun too :-) . 
  i am happy i went there before i stopped drinking beer due to being gluten intolerant ) . 
  well , it is up to the mods , but the real title was `` public masturbation not a crime : swedish court '' , which is technically right , in a journalism sort of way i guess . 
  it most certainly was n't a landmark trial , nor is it declared legal in any way . 
  i had read it before at r/economics , and what it proved was that the author is an idiot . 
  who the hell puts a baby on the baggage carousel ? 
  i mean , was the parent mentally disturbed or high on drugs or something because that is the only reason i can come up with with why anyone would do it . 
  not an excuse mind you , just an explanation . 
  or they wanted to kill their baby . 
  yes , the loss is on him . 
  i would n't take this case as a sure thing that one can masturbate on swedish public beaches ... 
  i hope and pray that they will remove the `` n\u00e4mndem\u00e4n '' apart from cases like freedom of expression etc. 
  apperently it was something that it was n't aimed at particular persons ... . i think , as you say that it would have been smarter to charge him with `` f\u00f6rargelsev\u00e4ckande beteende '' which is similar to indicent exposure . 
  instead the prosecutor choose sexual assault . 
  assault has to be `` aimed '' towards someone apparently , so that is why the prosecutor lost . 
  btw , if you were meaning to link something , you forgot i belive . 
  i am not saying that it is , i said it was better compared to the ** 80 's ** . 
  discrimination has decreased , * despite * economic downturns . 
  i am sorry , i do not see that combination . 
  violence/discrimination in sweden against gay people have slowly lowered and the toleration for such behaviour has become lower over time as well . 
  compare the 80 's to know for example - the 80 's were rich and tolerated lbgtq discrimination far , far more , than sweden does today , despite obvious economic downturns in between . 
  it has to do with education and the willingness of society and people to change their views . 
  apparently some do not want to change and/or educate . 
  human rights are based on what is a human . 
  science can help you . 
  it is funny because you want scientific evidence from me , yet your argument is `` i have a lot of friends '' . 
  take a look at poland for example . 
  the catholic church has been extremely involved in not allowing abortions , as in malta . 
  google it , i am on my phone . 
  furthermore , your ignore the argument that people who are not allowing abortions are teaming up with the catholic church . 
  that is a dance with the devil and i wonder how you can defend that they are legitimising an argali satin that are so discriminating , so non democratic ? 
  why ca n't a church be democratic ? 
  our churches are . 
  countries with almost as big as the church are . 
  how can you support non democratic organisations ? 
  why ca n't the be ? 
  it is also discriminating not offering gay people marry . 
  they have less rights than straight people - discriminating if women are so important to the church we should be allowed to be priest . 
  i so backwards of you to claim `` women are important '' while simultaneously refusing them influence and power . 
  popes can change things . 
  allow female popes . 
  who gives a shit if jesus was a man-lutheran churches and anglican churches are fine with female priest . 
  you just choose to discriminate women !, 
  i am not filled with hatred . 
  i do not belong to a organisation who discriminates half of the population . 
  i am not the one discriminating gays . 
  i do not rape children and cover it up for decades . 
  i do not see millions dying of aids in africa and still claim condoms should be forbidden . 
  you are . 
  thanks . 
  perhaps you can teach malta , ireland , poland and austria a thing or two . 
  but why is preventing abortions so important to the irish ? 
  catholic church ? 
  are irish people that religious ? 
  and why ? 
  the catholic church discrimnates gays , and women ? 
  the are against all forms of birth control and are the biggest hypocrites you can find .

  i suppose that depended \u00f6n where you were . 
  a czech that went to yugoslavia went to the west but a swede that went there went to the east . 
  as you have seen eastern europe is hard to define and insulting to some . 
  let 's say you meant the countries formerly behind the iron curtain . 
  slovenia and czech republic has already passed some states like portugal and greece . 
  ( and some more perhaps ) . 
  i guess that the whole ussr thing will end up as a few paragraphs in the history book . 
  agree , all countries that ca n't stand teddybears bombing are on my black list . 
  everything is relative http://ilovecharts.tumblr.com/image/1316393550, 
  i always thought that most in the south of europe are lactose intolerant . 
  if you only use milk in coffee and use a litre per week , it makes sense . 
  in scandinavia a liter of milk lasts a meal . 
  in fact i do n't think we have a name for it . 
  i always call it `` milk with long durability '' . 
  fittstim is better . 
  shoal of pussies as a derogatory term for feminists . 
  but he just quoted his driver so it was ok, 
  no dilemma anywhere , the only countries in europe with  20 % rate is bosnia , kosovo , montenegro , albania and macedonia . 
  income taxes are about oecd average . 
  if you check tax gap for norway it is not that bad . 
  the cost of living however . 
  but compared to sweden , `` balances out '' is not remotely true considering sweden 's high taxes . 
  yes , but : * the poor are not likely to have loans for real estate . 
  * the rich , money managers etc ( the rich 's pensions etc ) are likely to move the money out of the country early . 
  see the ongoing slow bank run in greece and spain . 
  in fact , our country is a good example of how inflation is used by politicians to avoid solving real problems . 
  during the devaluations pre-90 's , we kept our industrial base competitive by devaluation . 
  we did n't improve our competitiveness as much as other similar countries . 
  in short we helped industries that in the long term ca n't exist in sweden due to the labour cost . 
  obviously during the crises in 90 's it was politically possible to do a number of reforms that are still helping us . 
  we are among the top exporters in the world , more than germany . 
  among the fastest growing developed nations . 
  do n't kid yourself that inflation is helping the poor , it is like peeing yourself to keep warm . 
  well , during the day in good weather , there are very few that actually follow the limit . 
  no cameras and extremely few police in a very big district . 
  besides with very little traffic and quite good roads i consider it to be fairly safe, 
  i wish sweden would understand this, 
  read for yourself . 
  [ the leaked police protocol ] ( http://rixstep.com/1/20110204,04.shtml ), 
  bail does n't exist in sweden ( and most of the world ) . 
  your system is based on common law , which is used mainly by uk and ex uk colonies . 
  there are pros and cons for each but basically with assange 's history ( as it is now ) , he will be detained until trial , but i doubt it will ever be a trial, 
  here are the [ leaked police protocol ] ( http://rixstep.com/1/20110204,04.shtml ) . 
  judge yourself . 
  no it has to have minimum 2 year prison sentence, 
  sigh , the discussion was about how important languages are and that having tot learn many + a profession is not in most persons interest, 
  since when did declaration of independence and gettysburg address become an international literary masterpiece that would loose its historical importance when translated . 
  first of all it is important to you because you are american ( i 'm only guessing here ) . 
  as northern european i suppose that luther 's theses is more important but i doubt that i could read them or the magna charta , which i ca n't read . 
  still as from a small nation , the most significant books are not written in my native language anyway , i think that we are not so special, 
  i 'm only counting norwegian where i have lived 8 years and probably speak and write above swedish average, 
  yes but russian is really hard to learn, 
  as a fellow swede i kind of agree . 
  what most people do n't understand is that having a small language as a mother tongue , requires us to learn at least english . 
  to be proficient enough in english to work abroad takes a really long time . 
  i 'm here talking about not much more fancy than writing reports for work . 
  then learning a second language to the same level will take even more time . 
  i 'm not particularly good in languages and it is not my interest and frankly learning one language and then concentrate on what i like would be much better . 
  furthermore in sweden . 
  in many workplaces you would not be hired if you could n't speak english but it would just be an inconvenience if you did n't speak swedish as a note . 
  i consider myself to speak about 4.5 languages . 
  still can in norway, 
  you are making things far to simple . 
  the problems in sweden pre-crisis was due to many reasons . 
  sweden 's economic growth was slower than most other european countries . 
  we kept labour intensive industries and competed by devaluating our currency and the following high inflation . 
  then when sweden try to move a away from this quagmire , they loosened the currency control and pegged the currency , deregulated credit market etc etc. 
  with the still quite high inflation the interest was more or less negative as well as badly regulated banks that lent to much . 
  the crisis had been brewing for a long long time . 
  besides the generous tax benefits was removed before the crise . 
  and yes i believe that generous benefits make some people to choose not to work . 
  then i do n't want to take away them either . 
  you just have to find the sweet spot where it helps most and motivates people to work . 
  amazing that we had the crise in the 90s then ... 
  it might be that it was unsustainable and the first crisis that came along showed this . 
  the welfare state you are talking about lasted about 20 years and ended in the worst crisis sweden has had during modern times . 
  i was wondering about this . 
  he said firstthat hee came from zurich . 
  obviously learning that dialect is really hard . 
  also learn perfect german is hard att his age . 
  finally native english speakets have a very distinctive accent . 
  im actually amazed that hee got recidency in sweden . 
  it must have been obvious that hee lied, 
  no you could do nonmilitary things exactly like in germany . 
  for exqmple most of the resque squad ( ytb\u00e4rgare ) att the estonia disaster was this . 
  this had nothing to do with the military, 
  why would he ? 
  the next bailout ireland gets , then it must have an unconditional that it has to raise its company tax to an average eu level . 
  competing with lowering corporate taxes all around the eu is only good for companies . 
  yes this is all known ( but at least as i believe ) you underestimate the amount of work with children in general . 
  they have to learn everything and i mean everything . 
  being totally crazy of learning them everything early and only hand them toys etc that are educational just leads to stress on both sides . 
  i guess i 'll see if i was correct in 20 years besides my children are swedish and will learn english anyway . 
  when my oldest was 4 he could count to 10 in english and knew all colours . 
  probably picked it up in kindergarten . 
  you mean that a swedish 2 year old should not have thomas the train dubbed into swedish ? 
  i wish someone had told me that ... 
  calm down , you are not paying for all that . 
  he can have maximum 420 days of leave with a max salary of about 320 000 sek/year ( or 80 % of his salary ) . 
  i suppose that your employer chipped in or something .

  g\u00f6ran persson 's government in 1996-2007 pumped tons of money into it with no change ... reinfeldt 's government 2008-2014 started out well , reducing healthcare waiting times by * a lot * with some relatively cheap early changes , but then it kinda got stuck again . 
  not sure what current government is doing to improve it , but it seems to be mentioned less overall in the national debate now despite being just as bad as it used to be . 
  hell yeah , i love my cast iron stuff and use it like 90 % of the time , but sometimes non-stick is just better/easier . 
  one of my teachers ( older woman ) in elementary school in the 90s still scolded us for using `` du '' and how it was disrespectful ... only person i 've met that cared much though . 
  well you * did * stop using the [ bellamy salute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bellamy_salute ) while saying it in the early 1940s at least . 
  parts of the national collectivism . 
  do n't get me wrong , i do believe some collective thinking is good for a nation , but there has to be balance and there are related issues . 
  for example : - individual achievement is looked down upon to some extent ( though it has gotten better ) . 
  - individual responsibility when you fuck up is lacking in many areas . 
  someone takes a bribe and `` we have to look over our systems '' . 
  a social worker repeatedly ignoring a child in need until they suicide and `` we have failed this person as a society '' . 
  - sheer incompetence in for example doctors and 911 operators is to some degree excused because `` integrity '' , instead putting the blame for mistakes on the system or ... well , `` society '' . 
  - draconian rules punishing those who do not `` fall in line '' . 
  while the cases i mentioned above are people protected by collectivist thinking , some unions will use their massive influence to instead punish those who do not join their collective agreements and follow their rules to the letter . 
  company gives their workers salaries and benefits the workers are happy with ( and which may be just as good as the union collective agreements would demand ) , but do not join the union ? 
  they risk being driven bankrupt . 
  it has happened many times . 
  the workers agree that they do not * want * to join the union ? 
  the company may be blockaded and prevented from doing business until they can no longer afford to hire them . 
  immigrant worker breaks the rules even a little ( makes 500sek too little over a 6 month period or something ) ? 
  kicked out of the country . 
  the unions decide the rules and collective agreements . 
  they already lived here for several years and their employer admitted the rule break was their fault + offers to compensate after ? 
  too bad , you 're out . 
  when karl xiii had no heir , the napoleon general jean-baptiste jules bernadotte was adopted as heir-presumptive ( in an incredibly complex process which included much subterfuge and secret messages ) . 
  as the first king of the bernadotte dynasty ( the current royal family of sweden and the only dynasty created during napoleon still standing ) , jean-baptiste took the name karl xiv johan . 
  under karl xiv johan , sweden fought against napoleon in it 's final war , 1813-1814 . 
  * the policy of 1812 * dictated a complete change in swedish foreign policy , adopting the policy of neutrality that has now kinda stood for 200 years . 
   would be pretty one sided . 
  indeed , with finland on our side it 'll be the great northern war all over again !, 
  ( in which the swedish empire stomped a denmark-norway , saxony , polish-lithuanian commonwealth and russia coalition , then started it 's decline as charles xii decided to march on moscow and failed rather than accepting the peace terms tsar peter i suggested ) . 
  i know three gardens that have them near my parents house ... not sure how that area is compared to the average tho, 
  i have n't played victoria , actually ... gon na try to get back into ck2 sometime soon though . 
  thankfully , i was mostly finished with university by the time i got into eu4 , so i got the timing right there  currently waiting for the next release of the voltaire 's nightmare mod for it , with some italy stuff and bringing it up to date with the latest patch . 
  best eu4 mod out there . 
  difficult one , as there are so many ... 
  i 've played quite a bit of battlefield 1 lately , which is nice , but more often i 'm in minecraft and europa universalis iv . 
  i 'll probably go with eu4 , really . 
  that 's the nice way of putting it , yeah , 
  not sure why the party is , but to quote the minister who commented on it :  the arguments that can be given for the abolition of the dance permits , particularly in terms of order and security , outweigh the need for reduced administration . 
  then again , the swedish social democrats have always * loved * their excessive administration , bureaucracy and complex regulations ... 
  since the 1930s , dances at clubs and bars without a permit has been illegal , with the owner facing rather hefty fines if allowing dancing without said permit ( yes , it 's actually still enforced ) . 
  this includes spontaneous dancing from your guests , which must then be stopped , with security guards if required , or face said fines . 
  earlier this year , after several failed attempts by most political parties , a motion to remove this ban passed the riksdag with everyone except the social democrats voting `` yes '' . 
  while the social democrats ( as the major partner in the current government , with the interior minister defending the ban ) can refuse to do anything about it , they 'd have to give a very good reason for it , or i think they can be reported to the `` committee on the constitution '' for ignoring the riksdag . 
  yeah , ignore the dansk ... everyone knows it 's at * midsummer * you erect the phallos symbol and dance around it , while singing about [ tiny frogs ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/sm%c3%a5_grodorna ) , the [ provost 's little crow ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/pr%c3%a4stens_lilla_kr%c3%a5ka ) , the [ fox crossing the ice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%a4ven_raskar_%c3%b6ver_isen ) and other such things . 
  `` sm\u00e5 grodorna '' is actually a swedification of an english version ( `` in step , little frogs '' , written to mock the french ) of * la chanson de l\u2019oignon * from the french revolution . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sm%c3%a5_grodorna ^ ^ sorry . 
  the song is also used [ in minority report ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d25deeokjoa ) . 
  good thing they have so much oil to light it with !, 
  according to every poll i 've seen , support for a nordic/scandinavian union is by far the highest in sweden ... mainly because it 'd likely be the leader ( or at least perceived as such ) due to it 's higher population , higher gdp , geographical location , etc. 
  needs the full scene to truly appreciate how awesome it is : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=much5x98rxg, 
  v\u00e4nsterpartiet in s\u00f6rmland * did * [ want to make it illegal for men to stand up while peeing ] ( http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article14957561.ab ) at public restrooms back in 2012 , but most people ( [ not all though ] ( http://www.metro.se/kolumner/forbjud-stakissandet/evhlfl!sfepony3nbrgc/ ) ) just mocked them for how stupid it was . 
  probably what was reported about , but sensationalized and exaggerated to get more readers . 
  yeah , so i checked the site of the largest newspaper in sweden ... they had a translated version of this article : [ this goat with anxiety only calms down when she 's in her duck costume ] ( http://www.today.com/pets/goat-anxiety-only-calms-down-when-duck-costume-t105482 ) . 
  yep , there 's a ton that almost every pizza place in sweden has , and most places also have their own local stuff ... often named after the city , area , street , neighbourhood , some dude the owner knows or whatever . 
  oh , and some places have a pizza named after some local sports team they support , which gives part of the profits for that specific pizza to that team . 
  also noticed more `` fancy '' pizza places in the past few years , which tend to use goat cheese , rocket/rucola , pine nuts prosciutto , real mozzarella and finer meats on most of their pizzas . 
  i feel the stories get a more `` personal charm '' when they 're all about the same character though . 
  there 's also ones with bellman as the hero , outwitting his opponent and such : one day , bellman was invited to court to entertain the king . 
  after singing and playing the fiddle for a bit , the king asked what other skills bellman possessed . 
  `` oh , plenty , '' answered bellman . 
  `` for example , i am the greatest swordsman in the land . '', 
  the king got furious . 
  `` how * dare * you !, 
  do n't you know that your king is the greatest swordsman ? '', 
  he yelled , but bellman insisted that he was better . 
  eventually , the king calmed down and agreed to settle the matter the next day . 
  come dawn , bellman and the king met up outside the castle , surrounded by the king 's stewards and some local noblemen . 
  a servant handed them each a sword , and the king demanded to go first . 
  after standing frozen in concentration for a moment , the king slashed at the air , cutting a passing fly in half . 
  the nobles and servants applauded as the king bowed and smirked . 
  `` your turn , bellman . '', 
  bellman nodded and took a stance , sword at the ready . 
  when a small fruit fly passed before him , he slashed at it , but the fly simply flew away . 
  the king howled with laughter and placed a hand on bellman 's shoulder . 
  `` nice try bellman , but you missed . 
  you 'll have to train more to beat me ! '', 
  `` forgive me , your majesty , but you need to look closer . 
  the fruit fly may not be dead , but he shall never father children again . '', 
  we do in sweden ... though more commonly it 's as a `` bellman joke '' version of it where it 's bellman and two nationalities . 
  bellman being a satirical version of historical poet , singer and composer carl michael bellman ( though they are really nothing alike ) . 
  example from wikipedia :  a russian , a german and bellman wanted to see who could swim the fastest across the atlantic . 
  first out was the german . 
  he swam 1 kilometer and drowned . 
  next came the russian . 
  he swam 10 kilometers and then he drowned . 
  now it was bellman 's turn . 
  he swam and swam until he almost reached the coast of america - then he got tired and swam back . 
  we kinda have the opposite from parts of the left wing though , i guess ? 
  milj\u00f6partiet ( the green party ) wants to remove statues with any military association , including removing or moving any statues of historical figures known to have any association with military matters ( such as the so called `` krigarkungar '' , or `` warrior kings '' ) ... feministiskt initiativ ( the feminist party ) wants to remove the entire military and replace it with a `` feminist peace institute '' , and regards the military as a bunch of violent men who are only good for fighting ( disregarding that the swedish military is basically only used for peacekeeping operations and to assist during disasters . 
  there 's quite a few ... ** the battle of breitenfeld ** had swedish ( and saxon ) forces slaughtering the army of the holy roman empire , ending their ability to field a larger army and causing several princes to join the protestant side , turning the thirty years ' war in their favor . 
  this was a very important step towards religious freedom in europe , and cemented sweden as a major power ( the swedish empire ) . 
  ** charles xii ** marched on moscow after defeating a huge coalition against sweden , winning every major battle along the way . 
  literally everything that could go wrong outside of that went wrong , however , culminating in the king being injured just before the battle of poltava , which was then lost ( under the command of someone else ) . 
  after this , he fled to the ottomans , attempted to get them to declare war on russia , failed and was later driven out at the [ skirmish at bender ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skirmish_at_bender ) when refusing to leave . 
  started a new war when he got back home , was killed while overlooking some defenses , possibly by friendly fire . 
  started the decline of the swedish empire . 
  see , she does it so much there 's not even any media left to report about it !, 
  to add to what has already been said , there are a lot of rules , regulations and costs related to building in sweden .

  meaning the amount of natural forest itself is very high for europe ( total forest amount disregarded ) . 
  but it 's % of forest not % of land . 
  you make it sound like 3 % is a little . 
  for europe it 's quite a lot if you exclude russia . 
  i agree that they probably need help and they should be offered it . 
  the freedom of the individual trumps all of this though , as long as what you 're doing does n't hurt anyone else we have no reason to outlaw it . 
  how is sweden constantly breaking social norms and how is it heading to failure ? 
  `` my isis year , i thought i was so mysterious lol '', 
  well what is your reasoning ? 
  because he died and we 're all his sons ? 
  the worst is you get the highway next to the sexiest trees . 
  i stand by luf . 
  it 's brave to stand up for everyones right to consensual sex and not just what 's socially accepted . 
  the only arguments against incest and necrophilia in the form suggested here is emotional arguments and they should n't be regarded . 
  if `` it 's disgusting '' is your only argument then you should accept people using that argument against allowing homosexuality aswell . 
  aftonbladet is one of the worst rubbish tabloids in the western world . 
  but this article seems correct and i stand by lufs proposal . 
  i doubt people will start fucking their family just because it 's legal . 
  why should it be a crime , i think anyone should get to decide what happens to their body after death . 
  you thinking it 's disgusting is irrelevant , morally it is fine and should be none of your concern . 
  it only involves one person so not comparable . 
  it 's the same with the conservative youth clubs in sweden . 
  oh no that hurts . 
  we probably do n't care as much as brits think or want us to . 
  but still hope they stay . 
  especially kotor . 
  they 're odd enough that you know a few things about them . 
  some kind of christian news source ? 
  i 'm from j\u00e4mtland and we generally consider the oil thieves to be closer to us than the sauna trolls . 
  i 'm talking about the film maker who was murdered , not the painter . 
  yes todays `` provocative art '' is n't provocative at all . 
  a woman painting with period blood is what the youth think is provocative today . 
  real provocative art is the kind that people try to ban , the art that people will threaten and even murder you for , like the art of theo van gogh , lars vilks or charlie hebdo . 
  what i like about for example lars vilks art is that it 's so innocent , so minimally offensive and so legally clean . 
  artists go massive lengths to test the limits of art like that artist who faked suicidal behaviour and wasted tax money or that mexican artist who blocked a motorway with a truck causing panic , deaths and breaking many laws . 
  yet none of them can even hope of reaching near the level of rage and hatred from both the art community and the world as a whole as a sketch by lars vilks does . 
  political correctness should n't even exist in comedy . 
  comedy is a very important part of our civilization and it must be free from political correctness or it loses a lot of its purpose . 
  it 's pretty simple , if you do n't want to hear what a comedian says , do n't go to his show and realise the world does n't revolve around you . 
  because sweden owns the biggest island in the baltic sea and many other significant strategic points . 
  russia taking over sweden would put many european countries in a threatened position . 
  at least we 're trying to redeem ourselves in these areas , especially norway . 
  and amazonas deforestation rate has steadily decreased every year . 
  i think the compensation for deforestation is the biggest part , so many companies have a bigger than 100 % compensation . 
  but co2 emission is also going down in europe . 
  of course hitler would n't admit to supporting jewish groups in his speeches , they are purely propaganda . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haavara_agreement https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lehi_%28group%29, 
  you actually have both positions today . 
  `` nazis '' who are willing to ally jews to fight muslims and `` nazis '' who are willing to ally muslims to fight jews . 
  todays neo-nazi movement is far from organised . 
  this could be a the enemy of my enemy is my friend thing . 
  if he can support someone willing to fight both the british and the jews , he can probably oversee the potentionally inferior ethnicity , culture and religion . 
  germany supported just about any separatist group in enemy territory because it was a good strategy for destabilising them . 
  it 's possible he even supported the jews in palestine . 
  forgot about 2003 ? 
  i feel that southern europe is culturally closer in many ways . 
  it is true and it is around 27 wars depending on how you define a war .

  you seem to know the flair selling prices to americans . 
  i mean we have the relationship as brothers do between swedes and danes , we talk shit and insult each other alot but no one else is allowed to do it . 
  norway is a bit like the much younger brother the danes feel like protecting/cooperating alot with that are total bros. ( and mostly takes the side of the danish against sweden ) . 
  hopefully i did not assume to much as a swede even though i 'm obviously smarter than you danish . 
  you need to take the potato out of your throat when speaking !, 
  well the denmark - norway - sweden is a bit closer than france - uk though . 
  denmark and norway were a union for 300 years while fighting the swedes countless of times . 
  so a norwegian saying he hates the danes more than the swedes is sad for the danes . 
  then again , i totally agree with him . 
  kamel\u00e5s\u00e5, 
  `` you cant say those things '' ? 
  what planet do you live on ? 
  we have the internet now and information on pretty much every country that exist , i can look up how it is in finland and what the averages are easily . 
  then it helps aswell i have been there alot aswell . 
  you personal experience does not matter . 
  you show once again how little you actually know about these things when you are trying to say it is more expensive in finland compared to stockholm . 
  the cheapest i could find was around 1400 euro a month , for two rooms . 
  normal was around 1600, 
  i 'm telling you anecdotal evidence does not mean shit, 
  no you dont , this guy is average , if your family had less you were under middle class . 
  you show how little you know about things like this when assuming people that own/have a company have alot of money . 
  more often than not having a company is a big risk . 
  a bit late but you are just wrong , this is middle class in the nordics . 
  yea that is bullshit , even if i look here on reddit the americans say around 10 $ / kg is normal . 
  you are buying shit meat if you pay that, 
  probably because this is mostly middle class and americans prioritize cars alot more than the nordics . 
  the important thing about a car is that it moves and dont take too much gas/enough space in it . 
  as long as it does that we are fine with it . 
  i know alot of people who dont even have a driverslicence at age 35-40 , and they are all upperclass dr. in chemistry, 
  well that is in a big city right ? 
  the prices can be up to that in the big cities here aswell, 
  cultural, 
  yes . 
  nah this would be typical middle class atlaest in sweden , i would say finland aswell, 
  not a tourist attraction , old churches are more common than new ones, 
  but they are still one of the biggest producers , which means people buy it . 
  it 's literally impossible to stop all the sites from having their articles up , there are too many . 
  to make it work you stop them from getting to the sites . 
  you cant get up results for childporn either , google actually blocked sites for criticizing scientology . 
  it has also blocked neo nazi sites for an example . 
  they cant go for a witch hunt against the millions of sites the info can end up on though , preventing you to find them is easier since most come from the same place, 
  it 's usually much easier to get the information online , even if a student forgets their stuff in school they can access it all . 
  it also leaves more time in the school for other stuff, 
  the whole world in a nutshell for you . 
  when people use the argument `` i 'm a responsible person , dont regulate x i want to do . 
  regulate the people '' society does sadly not work like that , we have to customize laws against the minority that also affects the majority . 
  why would you think that ?? 
  they are sentenced to a punishment and when they have served it they should be free and not being affected negatively from it . 
  your first argument is just a strawman since this law was passed to help the rehabilitated to not get judged by their past . 
  we already have social programs to support rehabilitation and reintegration . 
  the reason they are making google block this is they cant regulate the millions of sites that can put up an article and make them take it down . 
  it makes more sence to stop people from getting to the sites from the search engine since you only need to regulate one . 
  the vpn argument is solid though , this does make that a possibility . 
  but i cant see they passing anything like that , it would make too much headlines and uproar . 
  it 's excellent for the rehabilitated , good for society and okay for the internet . 
  the contest is 50 % songs like this so it would not stand a chance sadly . 
  the alarming number of assaults ?

  if i try to push it as a fact yes , i just used it to show he was wrong that everyone have a hunter in his family .

  i think i have seen under 5 guns in my entire life minus competetive shooting . 
  yes i know , no doubt about it . 
  i just mean telling that everyone have a hunter in their family is a bit of a overstatement . 
  the same thing with some regions obviously have more hunters, 
  wasnt that the case through history ? 
  or was it only the elite mercenaries ? 
  well thats a anecdotal statement if i ever saw one . 
  i think many hunt , obviously , but not even close to what you are suggesting . 
  were i live maybe 3 i know hunt . 
  in my whole family ( hela sl\u00e4kten ) no one hunts .

  because if you want to attack one country you will get the others as allies, 
  the navy was named more of a defence , and that they are more than capable to defend against anyone, 
  nk would not be able to do anything . 
  it 's not like they are fighting hand to hand . 
  hard to do anything against sweden if you cant even hit their fighter jets or be able to shut down the artillery,

  its the same thing as saying `` people are dying in the middle east so you have no excuse to be sad '' . 
  its pretty disgusting .

it 's there : `` gro\u00dfbritannien '' . 
  the two sources you gave me both stated that you ca n't compare sweden 's reported rapes with other countries . 
  [ there is n't a general consensus about what the rape statistics shows . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_sweden#sex_crimes ) that is a fact . 
  this is also completely unimportant in this debate . 
  what 's relevant here is that you claim that swedes are subject to a lot of rapes because of immigration . 
  i 'd like to see a source supporting that . 
  you 're saying sweden has a lot of immigrants and a lot of rapes . 
  even if we assume both of those are true , you have n't proved any connection between the two statements . 
  edit : typo, 
   so , you 're saying a woman who is repeatedly raped only counts as one rape ? 
  so merely a stat ? 
  what ? 
  you quoted a source , i quoted parts of your source [ you left out to make it seem like the source completely backs what you 're stating ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cherry_picking_%28fallacy%29 ) . 
   the way you disregard rape and sexual assault is appalling . 
  why ca n't you accept that sweden has a disgusting problem with rape ? 
  i agree with you , we have a problem with rape . 
  every rape is one to much . 
  i am however annoyed by the way you use sources and rhetoric . 
   if we do n't count the swedish national council and apparently your definition of rape , i like this definition of rape , every act is one offence . 
  seems reaonable . 
   sweden still has one of the highest rates of sexual violence in the entire world . 
  how do you know this ? 
  the sources you have provided both says the statistics from sweden ca n't be compared with other countries as sweden reports rapes differently . 
  do you have other sources that confirms your thesis ? 
  i do n't like islam . 
  i do n't like christianity . 
  i do n't like any religion . 
  i will say that out loud and i do . 
  but i wo n't stop immigrants seeking a better life from coming here . 
  depending on how well we are able to integrate them here we should prioritise those in great need . 
  if we are n't able to help them sufficiantly and it 's rather safe to send them back i guess we should . 
  i do n't dislike muslims , i do n't dislike christians . 
  i think they could be as good citizens as any swede if given good education ( which as of now we are n't really providing , unfortunatly , but that 's a question of school politics ) . 
  keep cherry picking from your sources . 
   ** the number of unreported cases seems to be particularly high in finland ** : an estimated 2 -- 10 percent of all rapes are reported , compared to around 25 percent in denmark . 
  also :  the countries ' criminal statistics are not comparable . 
  apart from the differences in the size of their populations , there are also different modes of recording rapes that are reported to the police . 
  in denmark and norway the statistics record ** cases ** ( generally one case for one victim ) , while in sweden the statistics record reported ** acts ** of rape . 
  if , for example , a woman is repeatedly raped by the same man during the course of one day , each rape will be registered as a separate offence . 
  this is also true for cases where a woman is raped by a group of men . 
  hence , crime statistics in denmark and norway show how many people have reported rape , while the swedish statistics show how many acts of rape have been reported . 
  thereby giving credibility to what i quoted before :  the swedish national council for crime prevention claims that it is not `` possible to evaluate and compare the actual levels of violent crimes ... between countries '' , but that in any case the high numbers are explained by a broader legal definition of rape than in other countries , and an effort to register all suspected and repeated rapes . 
  it asserts that comparisons based on victim surveys place sweden at an average level among european nations . 
  `` probably '' . 
  i 've looked inside myself and my opinion on this is that all humans , immigrant or not , could and would contribute to society if they received the help they need . 
  integration is difficult . 
  but i believe it is the right way to go . 
  help as many as we can and help them help themselves contribute . 
  i believe the problems seen in immigrant dense areas is a result of bad planning and integration programs , not because of their culture . 
  the situation would n't be any different if we put swedes in rather isolated areas in denmark , discriminated them and did n't give them jobs because of their ethnical origin . 
  i 'll go to bed now . 
  this discussion has n't changed either of our opinions but i guess that 's the case in most debates on this topic . 
  good night . 
  i do n't feel better . 
  i 'm so sad , seeing all these comments about the `` problem '' with immigration and how the immigrants are supposedly ruining sweden following a post about how 16 000 swedes expressed their opinion on racism . 
  it 's just sad . 
  ok sorry , it is [ islamophobia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamophobia#racism ) . 
  do you feel better ? 
  how about you read your own source ? 
   the swedish national council for crime prevention claims that it is not `` possible to evaluate and compare the actual levels of violent crimes ... between countries '' , but that in any case the high numbers are explained by a broader legal definition of rape than in other countries , and an effort to register all suspected and repeated rapes . 
  it asserts that comparisons based on victim surveys place sweden at an average level among european nations . 
  you can criticise islam all you want , but generalising muslims and wanting them to have lesser rights than the ethnical group of the country is racism . 
  might be a bad source , i was on my phone and just copied the first link i saw with the story . 
  the thing is that it 's really not a matter of sources , him calling immigrants parasites is on tape and a fact . 
  why should i make a difference between what they say and what they do ? 
  i 'd say what they actually do is more important than what they say . 
  i could vote for the idea the party is built on , but in the end it is what they do that matters . 
  so what you are saying is that there 's danish people , and there 's `` danish '' people . 
  i 'd say that 's segregation , and from history we learn that segregation is never good . 
  a perfect example of racism . 
  the muslims immigrating to european countries want to escape this culture and have a better life in their new country . 
  why else would they want to migrate ? 
   please use arguments instead of strawmen , ad hominem and other fallacies . 
   borgarsvin . 
  could you provide a trustworthy source that proves that immigrants costs more than they provide and commit more crimes than ethnical swedes ? 
  even if this would be the case , we dump the immigrants in poor areas outside of the cities and refuses to give them jobs . 
  of course there will be crime . 
  and sure , put the criminals in prison , but do n't draw the conclusion that muslims are ruining europe because of a few peoples crimes . 
  http://expo.se/2013/sds-vice-partiledare-kallade-invandrare-for-parasiter_6266.html this is by the vice president ( correct term ? ) . 
  sure , it was around a decade ago , but the fact that \u00c5kesson have him on such a high position and ekeroth who threatened a immigrants with an iron pipe is still in riksdagen even though \u00c5kesson har proclaimed a `` zero tolerance '' towards racism are prime examples of their real opinions . 
  of course it is n't party policy . 
  they are n't that stupid . 
  there is a audio recording of how they speak of the `` zero tolerance '' within the party . 
  i 'm on my phone so i ca n't provide a link right now , but i think you 'll get a result if you search youtube for `` hur sd talar om nolltoleransen '' . 
  they say that people should n't be stupid and say inappropriate stuff in the media and that they should choose their words carefully . 
  jimmy and sd have numerous times spoken of muslims as parasites and that they are ruining sweden and europe . 
  i do n't understand how this is translated into only wanting to `` limit immigration '' . 
  it is obvious racism . 
   the edward snowden scandal shows us that europe needs its own autonomous security capabilities what ? 
  the whole point of this * scandal * was to make people aware of the us spying so we can try to make them stop , not introduce more spying programs . 
  for fuck 's sake . 
  i detest ( most ) politicians . 
  [ sw\u00c4rje !, 
  the difference is that by simple logic , we can assume a relationship between having little money and crime . 
  the same is not true for having a specific skin colour . 
  white people in poor neighbourhoods are as likely to commit crime as others . 
  there not being as many white people in these neighbourhoods is not caused by the colour of their skin . 
  [ so much crime ... ] ( https://www.bra.se/bra/brott-och-statistik/brottsutvecklingen.html ) poor people do more crime , not very surprising . 
  or you could simply look at an equal-area projection like [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tobler_hyperelliptical_projection#/media/file:tobler_hyperelliptical_projection_sw.jpg ) or [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:goode_homolosine_projection_sw.jpg#/media/file:goode_homolosine_projection_sw.jpg ) .

or greece . 
  absolutely . 
  greece could and did impose duties , taxes and tariffs on imports , also on such things like financial instruments and investments , but much more importantly could manage its deficit with the drachma and holding on to other countries fx reserves , much like sweden does now with the krona and euro reserves . 
  here 's the [ oecd source ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=rev ) , feel free to browse it at your convenience . 
  no problem , let 's not be bitter , we are just exchanging information , right . 
  my point is that greece was n't in terrible shape pre-eurozone even if there are a few salient points that stick out ( much like they do in every country , however ) . 
  i never brought up debt-to-gdp ratios . 
  i mentioned the huge trade deficit , which i view as the prime contributing factor in the crisis . 
  basically , greece has always been a client state of germany and some other countries . 
  it buys everything from them , not having any industry of its own to speak of , which is very much to the benefit of these countries . 
  it buys a few things from sweden , like cars and industrial equipment . 
  this has historically been the case , which is why it 's a different case than germany or the united states or japan . 
  also the size of the economy is a huge difference , that does n't give merit any sort of comparison between these countries and greece . 
  comparisons with ireland and portugal are more like it . 
  for that reason , that it has always been a net importer , its induction in the eurozone was a terrible idea for greece , because it was bound to create these problems . 
  before , greece * could * do things about the trade deficit : it could make money off imports via import taxation , tariffs , or even foreign exchange reserves . 
  now it can do * none * of those things , because of the unified currency and unified trading zone of the eurozone . 
  it must look to europe for balancing out these deficits since europe is in control of the euro , and europe has done absolutely * nothing * to help , except publicly blame greece . 
  i am very much against that . 
  very disappointing . 
  all of those are very spurious comparisons . 
  to begin with : some of your figures are definitively wrong . 
  japan has the highest debt-to-gdp ratio in the world , clocking in at over 200 % . 
  and are you seriously wanting to compare the economies of the united states , japan , and germany to that of greece ? 
  are you aware how many security valves the states for example have on a federal level to prevent financial meltdown ? 
  are you aware that , to prevent a debt crisis in 2008 , the us essentially bought out debt by printing more money , something greece could never in a million years have done after it joined the eurozone because it was n't in control of its currency ? 
  greece did n't start way worse off . 
  it was at 98 % debt to gdp ratio , which is fair for a country that is always been a net importer . 
  the trend is the same , like you mentioned . 
  so how was it way worse off ? 
  it was n't . 
  the problems were there , but they have been magnified and exacerbated a hundredfold because of the eurozone 's poor design . 
  like i said , greece has no access to correcting mechanisms of its economy . 
  they are at the hands of the european central bank , that has shown absolutely no incentive to help out beleaguered countries , which is what the eurozone compact was to begin with . 
  what are those comparisons you made worth ? 
  absolutely nothing . 
  any one country can not be considered * in vacuo * . 
  do you want to completely ignore the economic history of greece in favor of making a worthless comparison with a country a hundred times as large ? 
  that 's absurd , nonsensical , and what 's infinitely worse , it 's a misrepresentation of the worst magnitude . 
  i do n't know that you read your own link . 
  i see a debt-to-dgp ratio of around 98 before the eurozone , which is fairly standard . 
  it 's what countries like belgium , france and britain have . 
  i see an over 40 % increase since 2006 , which is what people ( like myself ) are arguing is the harmful effect of the eurozone on greece . 
  you are completely off . 
  no one benefited as much from the eurozone as the industrial exporting countries of the eurozone , and to pretend otherwise is a huge disservice to the people of europe . 
  trade tariffs gone , no currency exchange loss , no import taxation . 
  since the eurozone 's inception , german exports to greece have risen by 150 % - that is , they have more than doubled . 
  i hope you understand how this is a massive increase in profits . 
  in contrast , greek exports to germany have risen by almost 10 % . 
  that is a massively imbalanced trade deficit , and greece has access to ** none ** of the corrective mechanisms that can be undertaken to fix it ( measures such as fx reserves , import taxation , foreign exchange measures like raising or dropping the exchange rate ) , because the eurozone leaders did not think that far . 
  any kind of corrective and collective mechanism that would attempt to restore parity ( such as a theoretical eurobond ) have been shot down without a second thought by said exporting countries . 
  and to address what you think is a benefit , holding a country that does ** not ** have a german economy 's level sustainability to german standards , in order to access german interest rates , like for example inflation requirements , is definitely not a benefit . 
  in short , greece is held up by germany and co. as a client state whose only role is to buy german products . 
  when they inevitably fail because of these short-sighted policies , the strategy is to blame them to avoid any real examination of the problem . 
  this is an unpopular opinion , i know , and harder to accept , because it wo n't show up in any kind of journalistic media , but i believe it 's the truth . 
  it 's by far not the result of only that . 
  the situation only came to a head because of the trade deficits and fiscal imbalances put in place by an incomplete and poorly-thought out trade and currency union , which is what the eurozone is . 
  western media like to propagate this story , that greece and italy and spain and portugal have reaped what they have sown , while they themselves are completely blameless , and while it 's occasionally easy to see through that bullshit , it 's sad to see that some people still buy wholesale into it . 
  finally , you are deluded if you think your country is free of corruption . 
  if it benefits a bank or a big industrial corporation , it 's simply not called corruption , but something else to disguise it . 
  what a load of bullshit . 
  maybe you want the eiffel tower too since maybe london is visited by more people than paris ? 
  maybe all the world 's museums ? 
  your sense of entitlement is unbelievable . 
  fuck you . 
  that is a good point , and it is exactly what those people asking for `` fiscal transfers '' and `` wealth redistribution '' are asking for . 
  the cost of a new plant is too much for the greeks to undertake ; but if a german company came and opened up a plant in their country , that would mean that a real transfer of wealth took place , and new jobs opened up in greece . 
  that is part of what needs to be done ; however even in that regard greece is screwed because the former eastern bloc countries are more competitive , in terms of lower costs and wages , than greece , so germany would rather open up plants in slovakia , bulgaria , romania than greece . 
  and with the influx of countries that are historically poorer than greece , no matter how much greece becomes poorer , there will always be a poorer former soviet neighbor to expand to for german companies . 
  thank you very much for posting this, 
  letting greece revert to the drachma at this juncture would completely destroy them short-term . 
  since there is no mechanism , and no legal framework to formalize an exit to the currency , it will ( rightly ) be taken to mean that the euro area is n't anything else than a currency pegging mechanism that anyone whose fiscal targets are not met can be expelled from . 
  understandably this will hurt everyone in it and in the future countries such as france and italy might start thinking about exiting , too , since the lofty ideals that created it have gone the way of the dodo and now it 's just a way for germany to be an exporting powerhouse . 
  in short , there is no prosperity for everyone ; there is just prosperity for a few , and poverty in the cards for the rest . 
  as for greece , since all of its debts are pegged to the euro and governed by british law since the first bailout , it will not be able to pay back anything as the drachma would be devalued compared to the euro a second after it was issued . 
  life would be much worse for the average greek than it is now . 
  we are talking absolute misery . 
  starvation , riots , food stamps , medicine and other essential shortages . 
  there is no good way to do any kind of stabilization except one : the only one . 
  debt relief , and promote growth . 
  the combination of additional loans , austerity , and demands for costly reforms are demonstrably killing greece , absolutely and irreconcilably with the supposed good intentions and the visage of the `` caring partner '' all these disasters are foisted on them . 
  you should n't . 
  like i told you above , germany has profited * massively * from using a common currency . 
  if i were a net exporter of the magnitude of germany , my wet dream would be to gather up a bunch of my client countries that i export to , and ask them to use the same currency as mine . 
  of course the euro was sold as much more than that . 
  it was sold as beginning of the federal states of europe . 
  but a currency union , because of these exact problems i 've been explaining , ca n't function without equal fiscal transfers - wealth redistribution . 
  and since that has n't happened except in the capacity of your post , which is far too little compared to what is necessary , essentially the poor can only keep up with the only way left to them : borrowing . 
  it 's not a coincidence all the `` peripheral '' economies of the eurozone have run into borrowing trouble . 
  greece 's is only the most acute because of their systemic problems , but the eurozone nations will keep running into this trouble forever , greece or no , until a fiscal transfer mechanism is implemented . 
  this matter was very well known . 
  godley and others argued it in the 90s to no end , and it 's the exact reason the uk declined to enter the currency union , they argued it in the british parliament for months and months , talking about this exact situation : unequal competitiveness economies forced to join into a common currency , with the inevitable result of the less competitive economy collapsing . 
  greece should never have entered the union if there was going to be no fiscal transfer going its way . 
  it had nothing to gain other than weaken itself . 
  unfortunately it was lured by promises of `` european solidarity '' and `` european prosperity '' which have promptly evaporated when they were needed the most . 
  well , in other products the difference might be much more noticeable . 
  if you have to pay half price for something german , instead of something polish , would you take it ? 
  how about if you were trying to save money in the midst of a crisis ? 
  see , it 's not as simple as telling people to shop `` hip '' . 
  and also you know there are many industries that you simply ca n't start in greece .

  russia 's contribution this year was also quite traditional , keeping most of the eurovision song format . 
  australia 's contribution was a modern power balad , and delivered flawlessly . 
  power ballads have been popular for a while , but at least their different from 80 's `` schlager '' . 
  probably , the juries consist of people that are more interested in music than the general public and with a stronger tendency to think that eurovision should change with the times and not be stuck in the 80 's . 
  i 'm afraid you have caught the gay , if you are a man . 
  italy won the pop vote last year, 
  a lot of people did think it was great song, 
  polarising song, 
  i disagree . 
  going last is an advantage . 
  sweden could n't vote in semifinal 2 , this could explain why norway did not make it this year . 
   is it ` scone ' or ` scon ' ? 
  it 's decidedly `` sk\u00e5ns '', 
  nearly everyone i met in japan had a decent grasp of sweden , though . 
  ha , i refuse to spell it any other way than aluminium . 
  still american english rules supreme . 
  i tried to spell armor with a ` u ' for the longest time . 
  now , i 've resigned to using american spelling . 
  i will use uk english words and slang if i want to , however .

  why is every hockey fan in the world so concerned with it ? 
  it should be all-american us only hockey .

  bah , we colonized the shit out of these regions . 
  and you ca n't get much more swedish than h\u00e4lsingland . 
  not committed enough . 
  yup , and eesti can not into nordic quite yet . 
  they 'd be electable for temporary visa , as normal . 
  there 's no evidence the guy is affiliated with religion at all . 
  the vast majority of people who are able to stab someone are able to pronounce the words allahu akbar, 
  only for 1.5 billion people . 
  in 1866 a thousand veterans from the civil war marched on canada , won a battle in which they killed 12 people , before they were forced to withdraw by the american command . 
  i do n't know about bombs in the us , but irish nationalists launched their own , unsanctioned attack on canada in 1866 . 
  the idea was that britain would fight the us in canada , so they 'd have less resources to use in ireland . 
  ( they also built a submarine with the intention to use it to privately sink british ships on the american coast , but that plan was discovered as the vessel neared completion ), 
  what we can learn from this is that the strife was real , the conflict was real , the problems with criminality were real , but ultimately , it abated , and the irish in the us became americans . 
  similarly , i think that as long as the rate of immigration into europe is reasonable ( < 1 % of population per year ) , and the furor of the relatively young ideology of islamism dies down , * and we stick to our liberal values * , europe will be fine . 
  different , yes , mostly similar , yes . 
  keep in mind that communist terrorism was a problem for ~ 60 years ( 1917-77 ) , and we came out that fine .

  read better sources . 
  breivik leads a miserable existence . 
  he 's completely isolated from everyone except trained professionals . 
  he has no access to information . 
  he tried to sue the norwegian state , won in the case of regular naked cavity searches , but lost in the case of right to correspondence . 
  he 's kept at the brink of losing his mind . 
  you would n't last more than a week in this `` hotel '' , which breivik is unlikely to ever get out of . 
  hmm , interesting that in this war , breivik still outnumbers `` the enemy '' a factor ten to one in the nordic countries . 
  * russian tv after mh-17 * russian reporting on ukraine in general * soviet handling of chernobyl ultimately , you still have to believe that there are people who report the primary facts in a manner that agrees with your understanding of truth and knowledge, 
  my impression is that russian propaganda is all over the place . 
  both blatant and subtle . 
  the reason they spread rumours that are obviously false is to nurture the conspiracy theorists , lower trust in official statements about events , and disturb the consensus . 
  just look at what the american right has done with climate change . 
  a barrage of stuff . 
  also , contrary to what many believe , immigrants from high nativity countries have a total fertility rate maxing out at 3.0 in the first generation , then it goes down . 
  most of ukraine is perfectly safe for the obviously jewish . 
  my family in ukraine root for the small remaining jewish community in their city , have plenty of contacts in israel , etc. 
  the ww2 massacre in kiev ( babi yar ) was forgotten during soviet years ( the mass grave was bulldozed over ) , but is now remembered openly . 
  if someone said that ukrainians are about as homophobic as russians , i 'd have to agree , though . 
  this sounds good , but it 's quite off . 
  unless you live in these areas , you do n't understand . 
  i do n't understand it either . 
   these politicians pretending that they are unaware are simply lying . 
  they 're willingly turning a blind eye to this in order to protect the parents , the saudi-funded clerics and the muslim community in general . 
  they do n't care about the children . 
  children can not vote nor do they have a voice or any money . 
  hogwash . 
  this is about sticking your head into the sand , because the problem sounds unreal . 
  they sure as hell do n't like the fundamentalist clerics . 
  the muslim organisations are simply good at knowing what to say . 
  separate what you say in arabic and what you say in swedish . 
  it 's happened over and over again . 
  the largest problem is clinging to dishonest talking partners . 
  some of the larger muslim organisations want to paint over all problems while getting fee reign in their neighbourhoods . 
  you 're absolutely right . 
  the point is that most of these 300k engineers did not leave great jobs in romania . 
  consider this : in ukraine it 's considered a bad idea to get a degree in engineering . 
  why ? 
  because there are few good engineering jobs in ukraine . 
  the same probably held in romania the last 20-25 years : a lack of good engineering jobs . 
  good . 
  we can walk over lilla b\u00e4lt when you have given up . 
  a united europe is strong enough to tackle anything the world has to offer , except for 19th century nationalism and catastrophic global warming . 
  yes , denmark can into irrelevance  you should leave nato too . 
  i think we would have had the germany outcome : we would have been fine . 
  maybe we would have had to pay more to greece . 
  well , we do have politicians calling for `` dialogue '' , and claiming that a nato membership would `` aggravate russia '' . 
  but that 's not major themes . 
  2/3 or so of the turks who support erdogan only do what they think is right . 
  they get 99 % of their information from tv and what their family and friends say . 
  they think by voting for erdogan they do the right thing . 
  they are not subhuman , they simply have a limited worldview that is mostly out of their hands to change . 
  i do n't blame them . 
  unlike most involved in the western alt-right , who have plenty of information to go on , but openly choose an illiberal , conspiratory outlook where the preservation of skin tone is the top priority , these turks are being used . 
  it 's the political elite that uses them that 's evil , not them . 
  unless they do evil in erdogans name , of course . 
  i 'm not under threat .

  britain does n't have freedom of press guaranteed in law as far as i understand it ? 
  most have . 
  i believe great britain is the only exception . 
  the actual details differ of course ; no country - the us included - have unrestricted free speech , and some countries frame it as a right to print and publish rather than speak . 
  it can get more difficult to find information since it might not be governed by a single law , but separate laws for publication , private speech , defamation laws and so on . 
  the pan-european pita kebab . 
  turkey by way of berlin , then lightly flavoured by the local traditions in every country that serves it .

  front page headlines in the largest papers is `` media silent '' ? 
  strange definition of `` silent '' . 
  and makram\u00e9 . 
  i guess it 's all words of french origin . 
  `` caf\u00e9 '' and `` th\u00e9 '' for instance . 
  the spelling of tea is old-fashioned but cafe is normally spelled that way . 
  there 's more words that use it as well , i 'm sure ; i just always suck at coming up with specific examples . 
  swedish uses the \u00e9 as well . 
  not `` where did it originate '' but `` what is popular '' . 
  in other countries i 've been , it 's always sweden and the scandinavian countries that are brought up as examples . 
  it may have originated in germany ( i have no idea ) , but that 's not from where the concept became popular . 
  yes , video games and music . 
  but also the ideas of `` ombudsman '' , and `` welfare society '' . 
  i 'd say those have a greater long-term , large-scale societal impact than waterloo or candy crush saga . 
  i really _ hope _ so , at least ... 
  good , solid , worthy choice all around . 
  we do n't hear a lot about tunisia now precisely because of the efforts of these people . 
  merkel would be far too early ; it 's still mid-cricis .

  you seriously , _ seriously _ have the best beer on the continent . 
  not just the taste or the quality , but you have the sense to make beer weak enough that the flavour is optimised , and you can have a beer with your ( very tasty ) food without getting a buzz . 
  now , if you just were n't so rabidly against immigration we 'd actually consider moving there ... 
  the british press truly sets an example for the world with its restraint and careful consideration of facts , do n't they ? 
  deep-fried marmite ? 
  fusion junk food . 
  once article 50 is invoked there is no staying . 
  at the end of two years the membership is cancelled , treaty or no treaty . 
  two children , then twins . 
  the twins bit was n't planned of course - i believe they intended to stop at three , 
  it 's marriage though , not cohabitation , and that makes the numbers difficult to compare . 
  sweden may have late marriages , but many live together beforehand and only marry once they 're certain they 'll stay together . 
  my brother and his wife got married last year - after living together for six years , with a house and four children . 
  several friends have taken the same route of marrying only once they already have children and a life together . 
  many countries are non christian and people have only a vague notion of any details such as names or beliefs . 
  aristoteles , on the other hand , is somebody you 're likely to hear about in school pretty much everywhere . 
  in most cases , by the time you 're 18 you are out of high school , and you 're either starting to work and so you move to your own place ; or you go to university , in which case you 're again moving from home ( and likely to a different city ) . 
  grant money is used for salaries . 
  that 's often the largest item in a grant budget . 
  and often that includes the salary of the pi - if you do n't land a grant , you lose your postdocs and mostor your own income . 
  teaching is time away from science . 
  actual research is generally funded through external grants , in eu and elsewhere . 
  nobel prizes are for things that `` benefit humanity '' . 
  practical applications was the intent . 
  see the prices for blue leds or carbon nanotubes for instance . 
  math is not really applied directly like that . 
  there 's no , say , geology or philosophy prize either , for the same reason . 
  and some legal scholars claim that the prize committee is skating on thin ice with their awarding prizes for abstract physics discoveries - how does the higgs boson confirmation benefit humanity , exactly ? 
  it 's just because you can disguise sudden sneezes . 
  '' ... and then we have . . ah . . aah . . _ cauchiiii _ um , that is who discovered this theorem i think . '', 
  true enough . 
  but polls even in warn-torn countries show that the vast majority of people will rather live in the country - and region - of birth if they can at all manage it , and will flee the minimum necessary distance away if there is no choice . 
  actual far-traveling migrants is a fairly rare thing to begin with . 
  and since it 's so difficult to get citizenship or permanent residency you have a lot of stickiness . 
  people will stay longer than they want to get that safety assurance , and will hesitate to move again once they get it since it 's so valuable . 
  if citizenship or residency were something you basically could pick up at the airport people would be much more likely to leave again , as well as arrive , knowing that the door is not closed . 
  not at all . 
  rather , the society , in the form of health care system , assisted living and similar , should be the primary caregiver . 
  there 's a feeling that having to impose on family for intimate and not always delicate issues is embarrassing and demeaning . 
  a health care professional changing your diaper feels more acceptable and less of a loss of autonomy than being forced to rely on your daughter to do the same . 
  could just not draw a line at all . 
  let people decide for themselves what they are . 
  i bet it would cause a lot less problems than many people think , and less than the current system of a maze of arcane rules and regulations . 
  sorry sk\u00e5ne , you just do n't belong . 
  norrbotten - the northernmost area of sweden - has about 200k people in total . 
  some of those other scandinavian areas are even smaller . 
  you do n't need a lot of people moving , dying or getting born to affect the rate of change quite a lot . 
  i 'd really like to see a map like this with a ten-year time frame . 
  by -35 or so you start having all the extra fun of protecting engines , foodstuff and so on from the effects of the cold . 
  because what you really need is a whole other set of tasks to do in the snow and dark before you can get inside the tent . 
  sweden is one of the least religious countries in the world , and we had a state religion - with a minister of religion , no less - when i was a kid . 
  people were still being born into the church ( so you could n't leave until you were 18 ) until around 1990 or so . 
  still , few people ever actually cared about the religious bits ; churches echo empty most sundays . 
  i think that perhaps the us needs to take a very strict approach to separation because so many people are religious , and because you have so many religions with substantial representation . 
  it 's one thing to have , say , easter friday off when nobody cares . 
  it 's another when a majority , or a big minority , of people angrily ask why they ca n't get passover , or ramadan , or vesak , or o-bon off as well . 
  also , of course , some of the main holidays such as new year or midsummer have no living religious connection at all . 
  you can argue that in practice christmas , easter friday and the rest is much the same as well for most people . 
  but i do see a greater focus on this in sweden now than there used to be . 
  in part , no doubt , because the number of religions are increasing , but also because there is more of an active awareness of atheism as something worthwhile , rather than just an absence of religion . 
  um , i like helly hansen well enough , and i know our good norwegian neighbours enjoy their time out in the wild , but i do n't really believe a company making clothes for construction work , forestry and hiking would be the top brand even there . 
  bring back the classic hh fleece sweater .

  on the other hand , the eating and drinking at the end of the day seems a lot of fun .

  well neutral in the sense that we 're not part of a military alliance ( apart from the defence alliance the eu ) . 
  but they seemed to be talking about sweden so i assumed you were too . 
  if it turns out they were talking about a fictional country in a world that does n't exist it suddenly makes much more sense . 
  i really do n't care about this conflict anymore , the more you get into it the more you realise it 's absolutley hopeless , no side will ever get into to a functional two state solution and palestine is already doomed as a country , the more time that goes the further away palestine comes from being a country and we 've already passed the point of no return many years ago . 
  i do n't think you understand what neutrality even means . 
  sweden has peacekeeping forces in many countries and has been doing this for a very lonkg time , we 've also had forces in afghanistan .

  actually norwegian childbirth is a fucking mess . 
  norwegians are born with skis on so preferably you have to get them out first , and that 's not easy , right after the baby is born the father will take it deep into the forest and have it live with the trolls , a week later you go back into the forest and have the trolls not given him back he is unfortunately lost forever , if he is back he is ready to be a norwegian and gets a lusekofta which he will be wearing every day for the rest of his life .

  i have tried that , and i liked it . 
  any certain brands you can recomend ? 
  personaly i like morbier , v\u00e4sterbotten , saint agur and mozarella very much . 
  no i took it from ** `` football fans '' **, 
  yes i do, 
  ohhh shit , i was so confused . 
  uh , where is this border ? 
  actually not too many years ago it was revealed that many of the submarines that had spied upon us during the cold war that we were absolutley sure were russian , were actually west german nato subs . 
  i know , so small . 
  you claimed they were not football fans because they 're hooligans . 
  they are football fans , just shitty ones . 
  you did n't even read my post did you ? 
  never have i claimed supporters should apologise for hooligans , i 'm one of the people who are most against that idea , i 'm even against the idea of collective punishment in the way that uefa punishes clubs with closed stadiums because of a few bad eggs . 
  you seem to be thinking that calling them football fans is an attack on football fans , that 's not what i 'm saying , i 'm completely against the image that media wants to paint of football fans as hooligans . 
  but the hooligans who go to matches are still football fans wether you like it or not , even if they think the `` matches '' outside of the stadiums are more important . 
  football hooliganism is very much alive here in sweden also , a man was killed earlier this year due to it . 
  what happened after that was that all other football fans came together against violence because football is a bigger force of good than a force of bad , but it 's not all good , let 's not kid ourselves . 
  no true scotsman . 
  we would have found mh370 before we found that sub anyway .

  i 'm severely offended . 
  our coffee ? 
  i did n't know we were talking about national identity . 
  that 's getting a bit old is n't it ? 
  i 'm not even making a political statement , it 's just how it is , if you 're born in britain you 're british , no true scotsman does n't apply . 
  that would only be treason if you were chechnyan , if it was a country . 
  even if you 're a citizen of the country you 're spying on ? 
  apparently they were used to tips at several hundred francs , like 10 % . 
  16 and 17 bother me the most . 
  what do you mean with identity ? 
  you 're not less british just because you 're a muslim or support questionable organisations or even fight for terrorists . 
  you do n't even have to be at war with a country to become guilty of treason . 
  if you share state secrets with russia or spy for them and get caught you 're definitely going to be tried for treason . 
  i remember the king of sweden got in trouble years ago when he was in saint-tropez and only tipped 4 francs at a fine restaurant , i think the chef was dutch because dutch media was angry about it , we did n't hear much from france . 
  i guess there could be different expectations on tip from a normal person and a king . 
  is that a beer with the coffee ? 
  it was the red october .

  so the kurds want me to support any kurdish forces fighting is ? 
  is pkk among them ? 
  it does n't specify , it just says i must give support to kurdish forces and i 'm not going to just lightly possibly support pkk . 
  `` the enemy of my enemy is my friend '' - bullshit is a part of why the middle east is in chaos now and it 's certainly not moral .

  we need to work on it as a society , not just shame them into it . 
  the latter does n't work . 
  let 's take an example from school . 
  i was never really into gym class , but i did love playing football . 
  whenever i played football , i would run like crazy . 
  there 's no comparison between how exhausted i was from playing football with anything else i did that i had no interest in doing . 
  but i could n't just play football , unfortunately . 
  i had to do gymnastics and every other conceivable sport there was , which i both found boring and myself incapable of doing , which in turn led to me both not performing nearly as well in gym class * and * equating exercise with boredom and other negative emotions . 
  if i had been given a bit more free reign to follow my own passions , i would have loved gym class and would have benefited from exhausting myself every week instead of just once every few months . 
  how do i know this ? 
  because that 's exactly what happened in the last year i ever had gym class , when it changed into more of a `` do whatever you want '' model . 
  i found that i really enjoyed running , so basically every gym class i went to the nearby tracks and ran . 
  it was my twelfth year in school and for the first time ever i enjoyed gym class , and my health benefited greatly from it . 
  if that had been the model from the start i would have had a very different experience of school . 
  but no : every kid needs to learn every sporty activity there is , regardless of their interests . 
  the diversity of activities is more important than kids actually learning to enjoy exercising . 
  i get that teachers need to show kids a smorgasbord of activities so that they can actually find something they enjoy doing , but perhaps there could be a middle-ground that allows them to * actually do that activity * once they find it . 
  basically , we need to revamp society in a lot of different ways , to properly encourage kids ( and people in general ) to be healthy without shaming them . 
  we 're pretty bad at that at the moment , i feel . 
  what ? 
  ( hard ) cheese on a sandwich - it ca n't get any more standard than that in sweden . 
  or cheese and ham . 
  but i 'm not a fan of food stuff that comes out of tubes . 
  at least not the `` to be put on toast '' variety of it . 
  mustard does n't become magically bad if it comes in a tube instead of a bottle . 
  i do n't remember learning too much in school itself other than the basics of where you where and some of your history during the soviet times . 
  the baltic states and their capitals all kind of flowed together in my mind until i decided that it was kind of embarrassing after i left school and did a conscious effort to get them all right . 
  since then i 've learned small bits and pieces about each of the three baltic states that i was n't taught in school ( such as the polish-lithuanian commonwealth being a pretty cool thing that i previously had no idea even existed ) , but lithuania is still the baltic country that i know the least about . 
  it feels a bit more culturally distant than both latvia and estonia . 
  although that might be more because of lack of exposure to lithuanian culture rather than some kind of objective assessment of how it compares to ours . 
  there was a hole in the toilet . 
  yeah , this . 
  i find it a bit difficult to sort out what i learned in school and what i 've picked up later , but these things we learned at the very least . 
  i do remember being very critical of a lot of the wars they 'd been in during the 20th century , though , so presumably we 'd learned of those as well . 
  finland-swedish is * the * cutest swedish dialect , without question . 
  i do n't think i 've ever met anyone who disagrees with that . 
  i 've personally never identified with them . 
  it 's cool that they 're there - a fifth of our population fleeing to the us is a big part of our history , after all - but sometimes you really feel that they left sweden 150 or so years ago . 
  a lot of things that really define the current swedish society happened in those 150 years , so it feels like we 've diverged quite a bit from each other . 
  me , i 'm perfectly fine with you asking the question here . 
  just know that a lot of people keep asking the same question here . 
  any such questions that are constantly asked run the risk of getting a bit annoying at times . 
  in terms of actual advice : since you like military history , i suggest the [ vasa museum ] ( http://www.vasamuseet.se/en ) in stockholm . 
  the vasa ship was to be the pearl in the swedish fleet in the mid-17th century , but since `` moar cannons ! '', 
  is n't the best instructions when constructing a ship she sank just as she 'd set off on her maiden voyage . 
  in the 1950s she was finally brought up , restored and interred in her own museum where you can go see her in all her incredibly well-preserved glory . 
  it 's an amazing sight and the # 1 recommendation i have in stockholm . 
  sea-worthy or not , she was built to impress and that shows . 
  yeah , the ethics section is a little weird at times . 
  take the last question : the ethics of a `` yes '' * really * depends on which specific group whoever answers the question would hold back to advance the rest . 
  the very richest ? 
  the poorest ? 
  the sickest ? 
  immigrants and refugees ? 
  then , in terms of religion , i would have liked a third option between `` positive '' and `` negative '' on the last question . 
  i have no one singular opinion regarding religion 's role in our society , so it felt a bit weird to answer . 
  that said , interesting survey . 
  i look forward to the answers whenever they come . 
  i have n't seen it myself , but i remember reading some really horrible reviews of [ sean banan inuti seanfrika ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9j-nl9nizc ) . 
  i loathe the guy making it , and apparently it was just filled to the brim with african stereotypes ( on top of just being god awfully bad ) . 
  y' all could come and celebrate june 6th with us . 
  i do n't celebrate it especially much on my own , but if we all band together i 'll make an effort . 
  well , watergate occurred 15 years before i was born so i do n't have any first-hand experience ( or any other either , for that matter ) when it comes to how it was covered/viewed at the time . 
  but i know what it is . 
  do n't know exactly * how * i know , though . 
  might be because it was mentioned in school , or because i 'm just generally interested in politics and stuff . 
  but it is the biggest scandal i can think of in american politics , and led to the resignation of a president , so it 's not like it flew under anyone 's radar . 
  i ca n't control my own attraction , and if other people can , well then wow , somebody 's been keeping quite a secret from me . 
  i do n't think attraction is necessarily something unchanging that you 're born with , but i do think it 's dictated at least in part on a much higher plane ( ie . 
  by society ) than the strictly personal . 
  i would n't even find you racist if you said that you only found [ insert ethnic group ] attractive . 
  i mean , if that 's honestly the case then that 's the case . 
  you do n't owe anyone to date them or to find them attractive - that 's an absurd line of thinking - so i 've always been pretty uncomfortable with the notion of shaming people for who they do or do n't find attractive . 
  i mean , i do n't get mad at women for not finding me ( a really chubby guy ) particularly attractive compared to the men ( quite a bit less chubby ) we as a society generally do find attractive . 
  likewise , i 'm generally more attracted to women whose looks match their current beauty standard , and me not being into chubby women does n't make me a hypocrite . 
  it 's just how we 're conditioned by society . 
  * and that might be a problem * , especially if society tells us that white people are more attractive than darker-skinned people , or stuff of that nature . 
  then * the society * can have racial problems that needs addressing , and perhaps you could also argue that the society has problems it needs addressing in terms of only promoting skinny people as a beauty standard . 
  but i feel really uncomfortable laying that responsibility on individuals . 
  i do n't think that 's fair . 
  if you feel that society is stacked against you ( and i 'll freely admit that it is , for various people ) , then work to change society . 
  but if you work to change individuals , then you 're just a creep . 
  i 've seen some people rant at other people for not giving them a chance because of their ethnicity or whatnot , and that really just reminds me of the creepy guys who 're angry at girls for not dating them because they 're `` nice '' . 
  at the end of the day , no one is entitled to anyone else 's time , attention or body . 
  do n't be a dick and tell them that you somehow are or should be . 
  and likewise , while i do n't think not being into a specific ethnicity is racist in and of itself , saying `` i 'm not into you because you 're a [ ethnic slur ] '' still is , * so do n't be a dick * . 
  edit : corrected small mistakes . 
  you have some cool tales , just not typically in the category that i would classify as '' folklore '' . 
  i do n't consider tales about historical figures to be folklore . 
  we have similar stories about certain figures in our history , but folklore to me is more supernatural . 
  so bigfoot , the jersey devil , native american legends - stuff like that . 
  i do n't find that particularly interesting . 
  the native americans have some pretty interesting stuff , but the us as a nation is a bit too young to have many interesting folkloric creatures of its own . 
  the '' problem '' is that you became a nation at a time when people should have known ( and many times * did * know ) better than to think that everything that went bump in the night was some kind of horrible , man-eating monster . 
  consequently , a lot of the mythological stuff that comes out of the us can feel a bit ... i do n't know . 
  no matter how i try to describe it i come across as a bit more rude than i intend to be ( that 's not my intention at all ) , but let 's just say that my opinion of someone who came to believe in ridiculous things a thousand years ago is very different from someone who did so in the last two hundred years . 
  one is an interesting look at how a faraway civilization interpreted the mysteries of their time , while the mysteries had largely been solved in the other case which makes the superstitions of that time seem a bit more ignorant . 
  this is also why older native american folklore interests me a lot more than the more recent american one . 
  or to take another example : it 's the same way i view people experiencing nightly visitations by aliens . 
  unless the myriad of people reporting them are all completely bonkers , there is probably some truth to their experiences .

  it 's not just hungary and poland . 
  even austria 's foreign minister has strongly come out against these quotas . 
  the only thing this proves is how utterly isolated germany is on the migration question . 
  even their own public disaproves of germany 's current refugee policy by over 60 % in the latest poll . 
  these clowns do n't even have their own people on their side . 
   against a russo-turkish powerhouse is this a joke ? 
  the major co-operation that could happen between turkey and russia is not in europe . 
  it is in the middle east . 
  do you * seriously * think the turkish public have any appetite to send their soldiers to die and bleed for some adventurism in an obscure eastern european country ? 
  you have to be utterly delusional . 
  furthermore , russia will carry the pants in any russian/turkish relationship . 
  with regards to the middle east , i do n't see that as a bad thing as russia 's policies have been 100x better than turkey 's pro-islamist stance . 
  europe would benefit if turkey turned into russia 's stooge in the middle east . 
  islamists and jihadists would find it that much harder to go abroad and get training as turkey would no longer close an eye and wink them through . 
  the `` moderate opposition '' would get annihilated . 
  the only two choices in most middle eastern countries is either that the islamists take power or the secular dictator does . 
  neither is pretty , but one sure as hell is uglier than the other . 
  to the mods : i realise this may be an edge case , but my motivation for submitting it lies in the backdrop of the debate about radicalisation in europe . 
  whether we like it or not , the diaspora links outside of europe matters for what happens inside europe , and we have to understand that the communities in our countries are not sealed off to outside influence . 
  in short , what matters * over there * , will affect us * over here * , as the british are now starting to understand and the french , too . 
  surprised it is so low for northern italy . 
  also interesting to see france doing so poorly , given that its gdp per capita is on par with the uk . 
  repping eastern europe , someone has to do it . 
   however , i will say , if their neighbors did not want to loose land they should not have all planned on attacking concurrently and razing israel to the ground . 
  and who is razing whose homes to the ground ? 
  the level of ignorance in this thread is astounding . 
   just because we wimped out over terrorism does n't mean israel has . 
  israel has a terrorism problem for the same reason the british had a terrorism problem in ireland . 
  occupation . 
  europe 's terrorism problem is imported . 
  israelis are very keen on trying to conflate the two so as to build sympathy . 
  you obviously fell for it . 
  the source is filled to the brim with quotes from many other institutions . 
  go to * any * think tank 's website in the uk and search their archives during the brexit campaign and look what they had to say about it . 
  you 'll quickly find the answer very monotone and repetive . 
  if you 're * seriously * going to re-litigate the exposed 350 million lie then all i can do is laugh at you . 
  you 're beyond saving . 
  the article does n't outright mention it , but an underlying question is if the rate is increasing ( on a per capita basis ) or if the authorities are less na\u00efve / better at finding this stuff out in recent years . 
  the statements in the article hints at the latter . 
  in england , they have started to get much better at uncovering cases of fgm , which has led to a rise in the reported statistics , but it is still hard to say whether it was a rise in absolute terms since the data quality decades back is that much poorer . 
  either way , i am glad this is being treated as the crime it is and is being dealt with . 
   it was a possibility of what could be done with the money that is currently paying for eu membership except ** it was n't ** . 
  that 's the whole point . 
  it was never possible . 
  ever . 
  it * does n't * matter if it was an election or a referendum . 
  the entire line was a massive lie from beginning to end . 
  get a modicum of an understanding of how economics work before spouting off stuff you have no grasp of . 
  you [ can do everyone a favor and start here ] ( http://www.nhscampaign.org/nhs-reforms/brexit-and-nhs-funding.html ) . 
   we 're clearly not wanted of course you 're wanted . 
  everyone loves the british ( okay , maybe not the french and their stooges , like juncker ) . 
  but basically europe really likes britain . 
  that is incontestible . 
  the brexit anti-eu smears have gotten to you . 
   if we stayed we are holding back the eu form further integration which it seems is what everyone wants most of the ee nations want a vision closer to the uk . 
  people used to dismiss them , but they won the argument on migration quotas . 
  merkel said borders should be open . 
  now she speaks of protecting the borders from the artic to the mediterreanan . 
  there are more friends in the eu for the uk than you think , and they are not as inconsequential as many believe , as the last year has shown . 
  further , many nordic countries are also close to the uk in your vision of a reformed eu , like denmark and increasingly sweden . 
   boris johnson said we can put # 350m in to the nhs . 
  one person yes , but he was n't corrected by the brexit camp . 
  i 'm sorry , but when their own * campaign bus * is literally painted over with a massive and huge lie , and nobody from that campaign makes a concerted effort to correct that , that speaks ill of the entire campaign , not just `` one person '' . 
   both sides were full of shit . 
  sorry , but that is moral equivalence . 
  sure , cameron made a few hysterical statements about war , but he was quickly shot down by the other remainers and then piped down . 
  you had a much stronger internal bullshit correction within the remain camp , which was totally missing from the leave camp . 
  this reminds me of people trying to equate the gop and the dems , just because being equal makes people get along better . 
  but they are not equal . 
  one side just lies a lot more than the other , and is more dishonest . 
  just because remain were not perfect - nobody is claiming they were - does n't mean we should debase ourselves to moral equivalency for the sake of agreement , when there is no moral equivalency . 
  fundamentally , the decision to leave is regrettable , but i am comfortable with whatever outcome . 
  the world will not come crashing down . 
  whatever poison the brexiteers are trying to fill your brain with , we do n't hate you , we like you . 
  always have , always will . 
  and whatever comes in the coming years , you can count on us and we can count on you if the chips are really down . 
  that 's all that matters , when all is said and done . 
  sorry for the low yearly range , bloomberg does not [ show more than five years ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/gspg10yr:ind ) .

   seemingly unnecessarily a lot of the time it is only brought up in the context above , namely `` europe wants us to fail '' which was - and is - a bullshit smear . 
  you should know that . 
  do n't you think that kind of bs is tiring for * us * to hear ? 
   it 's frustrating for me join the club  at this point it really is flogging a dead horse for you , yes , but this is n't for you . 
  it 's for those who keep insisting on repeating the discredited paranoia/false fantasy of the world is against us . 
  as long as that false meme is repeated , it will need to be corrected . 
  i understand it 's tiresome for you to see , but believe me , i 'm * beyond tired * of seeing this sub smeared as somehow wanting to see the uk fail . 
  it 's nonsensical and utter garbage . 
  whining to me about it will not change it . 
  why do n't you lecture the people perpetuating the myth ? 
  you 'd stop the people spreading the bs and you wo n't see people needing to correct it . 
  it 's a win-win . 
   most of poles earns between 1600 pln and 2600pln ** net ** it does n't make sense to compare gross wages to net wages . 
  everyone 's net wages are smaller than gross wages . 
  the fact remains that the gross average wage in poland is around 1000 euros . 
  how that is distributed is a political question for the polish society , but the point is that the * starting point * is quite high today . 
  net wages are just an indication of a society 's choices ( taxes etc ) , that is why it makes less sense to compare than gross wages . 
   for this major part of society everything is expensive . 
  starting with food , tickets , fuel etc.

  yoghurt like products are made and eaten pretty much all over the world , it 's one of the standard things people learn to make after domesticating animals . 
  [ the new zealanders do seem to grow quite a lot of it ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/2005kiwi_fruit.png ), 
  the various social democratic offshoots from socialism are n't exactly the worst thing ever though . 
  i get what you 're saying , but still get a bit annoyed when people shit all over socialism as a whole . 
  social democracy did evolve from regular old socialism , it 's goals where/are even the same in some cases , just got rid of the revolutionary bit . 
  especially during it 's early history their ideas where very much the same , only lately that the socialist bits have started to become really diluted . 
  i guess it does n't matter what i think , but in my opinion it 's not black and white between socialism or capitalism for example . 
  there can be a bit of both . 
  full on socialism is bad , that has certainly been proven , but that does n't mean any socialism is bad . 
  and i do n't mean that in a `` if we just do it slightly different it will work '' kind of way . 
  i 'm talking about the socialist things that has worked , like unions . 
  there are plenty of things within socialist ideologies that are possible to do without creating a dictatorship or killing millions . 
  i 'm with you as far as `` never go full socialist '' or something like that . 
  but i do believe that a lot of the best things about my country should be credited to socialism as well . 
  a little bit off topic , but wanted to say that , ok . 
   and , in english ( in england ) , without the ` e ' the ` r ' would disappear as it does in ` cornbread ' . 
  is n't that more or less what has happened to the r in n\u00fcrnberg in german too ? 
  ( correct me if i 'm wrong , i do n't speak german ) i get the m thing , but do n't really understand why the e is there , you have plenty of words in english with rn in them , you just said corn yourself for example . 
  `` german '' is another example but with m , you do n't spell it `` gereman '' . 
  the jews , obviously . 
  they can probably invade germany and start up some forced labour camps and stuff too . 
  or munich instead of m\u00fcnchen , coming from who knows where . 
  or nuremberg instead of n\u00fcrnberg , which i dunno , i think they just got that one wrong . 
  probably because you only see the funny things posted on the internet , most of the time he 's pretty boring , very official all the time and stuff , like most monarchs . 
  i think the only thing wrong with him is that he has dyslexia , which is a bit funny , but yeah . 
  also , a bit like the british queen , he 's been king most of his life ( since 73 ) , i think after a while they stop giving a shit about certain things . 
  to be fair , just looking at the actors , von sydow is pretty damn cool . 
  would n't mind having him as our `` champion '' , as long as he do n't have to actually fight someone . 
  danish, 
   having a country that does n't share eu values leave the eu vs diluting eu values in other to please said country ? 
  then everyone else who has slightly different opinions on the eu might as well leave too . 
  until there 's only like one country left , then the eu will work much better , no annoying debates between countries or anything slowing down progress . 
  it 's not about size , it 's about how much help you need . 
  the eu definitely benefit for example lithuania and croatia much more than it does the uk , but that 's one of the main reason the uk should be a fan of it . 
  allowing poor european countries to accelerate their growth is good for everyone in europe in the long run . 
  countries like the uk , germany or sweden do n't have all that much to directly gain from the union , but for example building up `` eastern '' europe and allowing for trade with them is great for our own countries as well . 
  in some sense you can compare it to the us and the marshall plan after ww2 . 
   but think we have nothing in common with other more similar cultures . 
  we have plenty in common , some european governments are a bit meh though . 
  a very good example is the debt situation that was created in greece . 
  swedes absolutely love greece ( the culture , people , nature , so on ) , but we 're not exactly in love with their government . 
  the reason we have taken in so many immigrants is partly because of our unnaturally high trust in our own government . 
  or it might be that the euro countries really wish it 's working well , since they do n't really have a choice in the matter , they are already in . 
  not supporting their own currency would make no sense , but they might have very well been better off if they stayed with their own currency . 
  either way , it 's not that we think it 's necessarily `` bad '' , we are mostly just more selfish than others . 
  just thinking about sweden , having our own currency is most likely better . 
  but if you think about the entire european union it would probably be better if sweden adopted the euro . 
  but yeah , swedes mostly care about themselves , and we really do n't trust other eu countries enough to cooperate all that much with them , as can be seen on many other issues ( like eu army ) . 
  exactly things like the greek crisis is why we do n't want to join the union , but also why ( looking at a larger perspective ) it would be good if we did , just maybe not for us . 
  it has it 's own colour , slightly darker than sweden ( same as the blue on their flag ) . 
  just like how sk\u00e5ne is red even though it belongs to sweden . 
  if an actual nordic union where to happen it would probably have an entirely new flag . 
  the idea i like the most out of the ones i 've heard is a blue flag with either just a white star ( polaris ) , or the big dipper . 
  pretty fitting for a country literally called `` the north '' in our languages . 
  unfortunately alaska has sort of taken that idea already . 
  denmark , probably copied it from some german city . 
  that was back in the days of the kalmar union , when denmark ruled all the countries in the north . 
  then sweden finally broke free from the union and eventually made their own version of the danish flag , changing the colours . 
  then several centuries later norway and finland got their independence and created their own version of the flag . 
  then all the other more or less independent territories also started making their own flags , and pretty much every province in the north now has some sort of unofficial cross flag , but how much it is used vary a lot . 
  there are towns up there , they are just small ( a few thousand people at most ) and very spread out . 
  but the coast is relatively well populated . 
  - does not include any lakes \u2713 also , why do you people care if turkey is in it ? 
  it 's not like it 's hurting anyone , unless you really do n't want to get any info about turkey for whatever reason , in which case do n't look at it . 
  and whatever colours you choose there 's always someone complaining . 
  both are built by the same [ family ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_farnese ) ( if you did n't already know ) . 
  yes . 
  although refugee is not strictly a legal term . 
  it can be used in daily speech in a much more general sense , any group of people fleeing their homes ( even within countries ) can be called refugees . 
  that 's not mainland europe , it 's on an island . 
  [ this is probably the northernmost town ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@71.0616111,28.2463467,3a,75y,2.88h,79.32t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1splc1vyxvvvcdpjrx7kxz3g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) on the actual mainland from what i can see on google maps . 
  i do n't know , but we do have some male nurses at least . 
  the more men we get into a profession like that , even if it 's a small amount , the less `` shameful '' it is for other men to go into that career , so it 's sort of a positive feedback loop . 
  and while probably not as big of a deal , the same thing is true with women in it for example , that 's not exactly the most `` normal '' thing for a girl to get into . 
  of course that is getting better as well . 
   yet no one calls for more men to be nurses they do here .

   does asylum-seeker = refugee ? 
  i thought they mean two different things . 
  an asylum seeker is anyone seeking asylum in a country , literally anyone can do that anywhere regardless of your current situation or background . 
  you will however get denied automatically in a lot of cases . 
  a refugee is someone who is fleeing their home . 
  in reality most asylum seekers are refugees , but they are not the same thing . 
  and i think asylum seekers who are actually granted asylum are officially considered refugees , since you know , otherwise they would n't have gotten asylum . 
  so in the above graph they are more or less the same . 
   on a side note , surprised to see so many eritreans considering it 's such a small country and quite far away . 
  it 's also a real shithole , them and somalia are both relatively small countries far away , but they are so shitty more or less everyone wants to get out of there if they could . 
  well not everyone , but a lot of people , more than most other places . 
   i 'm not an expert on the history of botswana though , so i do n't know exactly how all of this came to be but a low , steadily growing population ( 2.3 million , as much as rwanda despite being over 100 times bigger ) and a lot of diamonds probably had something to do with it . 
  no colonialism . 
  they did belong to britain , but they never really did anything there . 
  the place was more or less ruled by the actual local people , in a government more or less by their own design . 
  that 's a huge benefit when they got their independence , compared to many african countries were any social or political structure was completely destroyed by colonialism . 
  they probably would have been worse off without the diamonds , but that in itself does n't do anything , just look at drc , they are among the most resource rich countries on earth , and possibly the shittiest . 
  in a way the fact that botswana did n't have any resources was what saved them . 
   what is your secret ? 
  social democrats . 
  but i do n't know , i think it 's our political culture that was the main reason , and that has been shaped by lots of things . 
  actually , the reason we top many of these sort of charts is probably because we have been among the richest countries on earth for quite a while now , we can focus on these sort of things because everything else is working mostly alright .

  since my body is constantly bitching with me , future health care or some other miraculous invention that fixes that annoyance would be wonderful . 
  in fact , just give me that and i can forgive a little wayward climate change or the occasional world ending catastrophe . 
  why do so many questions regarding how americans can stay longer/permanently in europe or how europe should let more americans in , tend to be so goddamn creepy ? 
  * shakes head *, 
  swedish and english . 
  i studied german for a long time and can pick it up to a decent level fairly quickly if i 'm immersed in it , but since i 'm generally not it 's pretty shitty for the moment . 
  i can read okay , but i struggle with the rest of it ( especially speaking and understanding spoken german ) . 
  i know , right ? 
  i find the vikings pretty fascinating , but much more so for their exploration than their pillaging , which is n't terribly cool . 
  but then it 's like we just popped back up on people 's radar in the 20th century , with no one caring that a lot of stuff happened in the * millennium * between the vikings and modern day scandinavia . 
  i do n't know . 
  i feel like the easiest answer would be california due to its progressive reputation , but i 'm not sure if i could handle living that far south . 
  maybe northern california ? 
  do n't know how big the differences are in climate between the various regions of the state . 
  but probably some left-wing state with a lot of nature and a fairly moderate climate . 
  if i were to ever move anywhere , i would n't choose somewhere with the same dreary winter weather we have here in sweden . 
  so somewhere not too cold , but not too warm either . 
  * lagom * , as we swedes say . 
   as for a destination i really would n't want to move to , it would probably have to be florida . 
  it seems both so dreadfully hot and incredibly far removed from my personal politics that i have a hard time seeing myself enjoying even a brief stay there , let alone permanent residence . 
  we have n't been in a war for about 200 years ( unless you count our participation in various peacekeeping missions ) , so there are n't that many fallen soldiers to remember . 
  who does n't know you speak irish ? 
  i get not knowing how to speak it themselves , but not knowing that `` irish '' is an actual language seems odd . 
  i really like english spoken with a german accent . 
  it 's a shame that there are so many stereotypes about it . 
  i rarely find them to be too true . 
  seems similar to how we swedes see danish . 
  you just have to fight the natural , humane impulse to call the emergency service or initiate some kind of heimlich maneuver . 
  i also like how the faroese speak danish . 
  i 've heard the occasional greenlander and icelander speak it as well , and somehow i can understand the three of them 's danish better than i can when it 's spoken by danish speakers from denmark . 
  i 'm not really sure why , because i ca n't understand either of their native languages at all . 
  haha . 
  well then . 
  the most recent example i have ( in terms of when i first saw it , not when it happened ) is [ this version ] ( https://youtu.be/opt5pvjkgl0 ) of * visa fr\u00e5n utanmyra * by sissel kyrkjeb\u00f8 . 
  there is another version of the song by laila linde lossius that has a more distinct norwegian quality to it , but i ca n't find it on youtube . 
  hopefully this [ spotify link ] ( https://open.spotify.com/track/2hbuy3nxkskz8txtfoc7m4 ) works . 
  [ byssan lull ] ( https://youtu.be/3atcqmmkgqo ) sung by vidia wesenlund is another example . 
  at 1:18 , i first thought that he hoisted an isis flag , which confused the hell out of me for a moment . 
  wow , that was hard to understand . 
  that is one awesome cat . 
  hahahahahaha !!, 
  aw shucks !, 
  * blushes * since the moomin people have already been mentioned i 'd like to add female norwegian singers . 
  for some reason i 've heard several norwegians cover old swedish folk songs , and i always enjoy hearing how that sounds . 
  bonus cute points if the occasional norwegian slips through . 
  huh . 
  would n't have thought floorball to be bigger than ice hockey in terms of hours shown on tv . 
  i would probably have pegged it as being maybe top 5 , but # 2 ? 
  i guess it must be shown extensively on channels that i have never watched . 
  my grandmother used to make a soup with potatoes , * falukorv * ( a swedish sausage ) and onions ( i think ) . 
  obviously some spices added to all of that , but i ca n't remember which ones since i never learned the recipe . 
  it was glorious . 
  in terms of soups i can make/buy myself , i 'd have to say shrimp soup . 
  it 's rare that i eat soup at all , but i remember doing shrimp soup a while ago and becoming nostalgic since it was something i ate quite often as a kid . 
  it 's easy and tastes good , so i do n't know why i do n't do it more often . 
  would n't just detonating a regular bomb to collapse/flood the tunnel work just as well ? 
  nuking it seems like overkill to me , especially so close to the uk itself . 
  i have n't really had any experiences with the police ( in the sense that i was doing anything wrong ) besides that one time when they caught me coming out with my family 's fireworks when i was a kid . 
  i was n't going to fire them off unsupervised , but it was kind of a bad look for an 8 year old to carry a ton of fireworks all by his lonesome ( since my mom and sister were a little slow behind me ) . 
  aside from that i 've mostly only interacted with the police in stuff that relates to school in one way or another . 
  either they 'd come and talk to us , or i met and spoke with them as part of a paper i wrote in university about various volunteer groups who were trying to keep the streets safe . 
  but that was a long time ago . 
  the only police experience i 've had recently is them briefly questioning me to see if i 'd seen or heard a burglary in a nearby apartment . 
  [ my results ] ( https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=70.1&amp;d=65.4&amp;g=67.7&amp;s=79.1 ) : social liberalism . 
  i do n't consider myself a liberal , but i do n't mind the description too much . 
  unless there is an option for social democracy its probably as accurate as its going to get . 
  hehe , yeah , that question was a bit odd . 
  what 's the alternative ? 
  `` chaos in the streets !, 
  loot all stores !, 
  burn down the parlament ? '', 
  i could understand the question if it put law and order vs public protest and civil disobedience ( or something along those lines ) , but just on its own it was a really weird question . 
  how does socialism and libertarianism go together * at all * ? 
  they should be on the opposite sides of the political spectrum . 
  i do n't know much about estonian military resources , but subjugating you with one tank and six helicopters seems overly ambitious . 
  i knew about us training norwegians and now that you mentioned it a faint memory about potentially helping them militarily stirs in me . 
  did n't know that we did/thought of doing the same for denmark , though . 
  well , that was certainly ambitious of us . 
  where in finland do you live ? 
  i can imagine that it gets harder and harder for cats to survive the further north you get , but in the stockholm area wild cats are not too uncommon . 
  we do n't have any where i live , but there are a few around my mother 's suburb . 
  i would have assumed that the situation in finland is roughly the same as over here . 
  it depends on how much it is used in daily life . 
  i like languages and would like to learn irish if such an opportunity arose , but if it is n't commonly used on tv or between people in general , then i think it would be really hard to learn it . 
  swedish is kind of notoriously hard to learn because everyone here just defaults to english all the time , and i have a feeling that the same might be even more true for a country where english is an official language . 
  but if it 's possible to really immerse myself in irish ? 
  then hell yeah , it would be really cool . 
  i 'm pretty curious about the language , so i 'd welcome the chance to learn it . 
  resentment is not the word i 'd use . 
  at least not to describe my general feelings on the subject . 
  but would i want people to understand swedish to the point that stuff written in swedish could compete with stuff written in english ? 
  sure . 
  i 've been writing my whole life and it 's kind of disheartening to know that you can never reach an international audience as long as you write in your mother tongue . 
  i 've written about video games , but there is basically no money to be made as long as you write in swedish . 
  there 's just no competing with the enormous english websites that every swede interested in games can read anyway . 
  so that sucks . 
  but i do n't resent the english language or its native speakers in any way . 
  realistically , english is the only way for me to be able to communicate with people . 
  take away english and no one would still understand swedish . 
  there would be a little more room to create stuff , but really , the benefits of english far outweigh any downsides .

so it fills the same purpose that the white house does plus guest rooms ? 
  eh , i just thought since the human race originated in africa we 'd all have some ancestry with them . 
  as in every living person . 
  does everyone have a little sprinkle of sub-saharan african origin ? 
  lol what ? 
  there is only between 100 000 and 300 000 muslims currently living in sweden . 
  which is why i do n't get why people get so upset about it . 
  eh , most of them that i meet tend to be pretty secularized or at least fairly moderate . 
  wow , what a dick move . 
  he saved 31 000 prisoners from the holocaust and they killed him for it . 
  which is weird since it 's estimated that there are less than a million muslims in sweden right now . 
   there was no corruption what the what ? 
  * smoothie . 
  now i * really * want to know what they think of our new governments pending decision to acknowledge palestine as it 's own nation . 
  what about our flag ? 
  i know but still . 
  i expected more for some reason . 
  the fuck ireland ? 
  i bet you 're hilarious at parties . 
  it 's a town if anything . 
  i think the reason for this is because everyone is so quiet around here . 
  nobody except the sd supporters are happy with this election . 
  if i were to be optimistic i 'd hope that the reds could create a coalition with some of the alliance parties . 
  until the other parties actually start to talk about the issues that the swedish democrats bring up they will only grow bigger and bigger . 
  denmark or norway . 
  i really like danish food , but i can actually understand what the norwegians say . 
  germany !, 
  do n't be fart so much . 
  the same way that russian history has always gone . 
  `` then , it got worse ... '', 
  yes , i mean just sweden . 
  and considering how willing europe has been to help ukraine i doubt that they would rush to help us . 
  i do n't know about us . 
  our defense is estimated to be able to hold out for a week and that 's pretty generous . 
  i do n't know how to feel about this . 
  on one hand i 'm glad to see that the us is protecting it 's allies on the other hand this may serve to escalate a bigger conflict rather than deter it . 
  if this turns into a larger scale war with nato vs russia i hope they do n't nuke russia because the fallout will just whiff right over to us . 
  it 's happening !, 
  aside from the obvious one , i 'd say [ kristian tyrann ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_ii_of_denmark ) . 
  also sweden 's first actual king gustav vasa is known as the angry dad of sweden . 
  here in sweden you get assigned to a seat like you would on an airplane . 
  you have an assigned seat and it 's more expensive . 
  maybe not , but the way they run their trains is amazing . 
  you just buy a ticket , get on and take a seat . 
  really simple an efficient . 
  i 'd say if this ever happens , we let the swiss handle it . 
  that 's a really bad picture of stockholm 's skyline : /, 
  not to be smug but our trains are easily the slickest . 
  that 's kind of expected when there are so few of you guys . 
  now or during the late 1600s to the early 1700s . 
  gustavus adolphus and all that . 
  / r/worldevents is decent but a bit barren . 
  i do n't actually go on reddit for international news . 
  is this because of communism ? 
  eu has enough problems as it is . 
  well this is out of the fucking blue . 
  finland big !, 
  ^ ^ soon, 
  that we are all beautiful . 
  it 's actually insulting to be described with such a simple word . 
  where is the revelation ? 
  this does nothing to shatter any image of her that is n't already there . 
  yeah , the nature looks very similar to home . 
  we need a new miljonprogram . 
  just slap down some ugly ass commieblcoks . 
  what you say it 's true , but i think it 's not an unfair assumption . 
  ethical companies are the exception , not the norm . 
  sweden was n't exactly a nation in that time . 
  we really do n't have any good ones . 
  they look kind of stupid . 
  it 's been a reality here for years now . 
  though it has not helped . 
  nice to see that golden dawn is n't surpassing 10 % but that might yet to be seen . 
  though i need to ask if this is a growth for them compared to the last election . 
  i 'll believe it once they 're out . 
  no sooner , but i admit it 's looking likely . 
  just so you guys know , henrik arnstad is not actually an historian . 
  he 's been lying about having a bachelor 's degree . 
  personally , even if i had a bachelor 's degree in history i 'd not dare call myself a historian until i at least had a masters . 
  they always say that , but i 've yet to see it . 
  maybe they need a party . 
  a bit of fun after trekking through europe . 
  do n't you worry your little head about it . 
  we 'll have them eating pancakes and drinking schnapps by next summer . 
  that 's entirely true . 
  most opinionated journalists that writes for the bigger newspapers live a pretty cushy life in stockholm city . 
  yeah , our country is still in rehab . 
  ireland seems to have readjusted very well indeed . 
  welp , they 'll hate it here then . 
  we 're almost as bad as the british . 
  though i suppose the realistic answer is that the food they get is kind of shit . 
  iirc they were buying redeemable steam keys that were n't region locked . 
  ah , maybe that 's an assumption on my part then . 
  i know that game companies sell their game cheaper in poorer countries . 
  there have been problems within the steam community because people were changing to russian/indian ip addresses and bought games for cheap using those . 
  do n't quote me on that though . 
  it might also be that they have older version , something that 's not immediately apparent at a distance . 
  tech companies sell their wares cheaper in poorer countries . 
  i imagine that 's been the case with syria . 
  least we could do , considering it 's our fault the lapland boarder is getting overwhelmed .

  white people ? 
  you do realize that the woman interviewed in the apartment was a refugee from former yugoslavia when she came to sweden , right ? 
  are refugees required to have dark skin to count , or what 's up with this comment ? 
  he might be biased . 
  the muslims i know definitely do not feel that way . 
  sweden has always had problems with segregation , we have n't ever had any policies to prevent people who are poor , unemployed or have social problems from moving to the same areas . 
  in some parts of the country it 's poor swedes who are problematic . 
  so the real issue is n't refugees per se , it 's being poor and not having a way to become a part of society . 
  we 've seen the same pattern for 100 + years here , and now refugrees happen to end up in that position . 
  while europe is more than the eu , most of the people in europe live in eu states . 
  i understand where you 're coming from , but i do n't agree that this specific post gives the impression that europe is the eu only . 
  we 've got the same problem in sweden . 
  not sure if it 's because of siemens though . 
  what about sweden ? 
  according to the map we 've got a authoritarian traditional family system but we 've got a very socialist/liberal system today , not authoritarian or right wing at all . 
  we 're in this recession because of excessive debt , specifically . 
  it 's a pretty good summary of the situation . 
  i 've seen the video and the sd guys really act just like any other neonazi thug here . 
  it 's quite damning evidence of what they 're really made of . 
  some might act deliberately . 
  it 's not uncommon . 
  depression is just one of the causes of suicide . 
  i 'm not dirty !, 
  i shower regularly . 
  i want to punch this asshole really hard with a baseball bat in his corrupt little head . 
  no , the only country that comes even close to being that big of a player is germany , and it 's still off . 
  while germany is more populous , turkey is geographically larger and holds a key strategic position in its region . 
  there really is n't any country like that in europe . 
  i honestly ca n't see why you would want to be a member either . 
  i really liked your country when i was there , but i did so for the differences , not the similarities . 
  however , a schengen deal would probably be a good thing for both parties . 
  turkey being a member and their ambition to become a regional superpower are incompatible . 
  i 'm pretty sure we do n't want turkey to be a member . 
  the differences and interests differ too much . 
  absolutely . 
  it 's not socially accepted even if it is n't viewed as cp . 
  not sure why you 're downvoted , what you said seems accurate . 
  i do n't know about slovakia , but it was only sold in sweden for a short period of time . 
  i 've been to copenhagen twice recently , once last summer and once this summer . 
  the restrooms in the central station charged both times . 
  as someone who intensely dislikes the taste of pork but loves beef : fuck the people involved in this . 
  so you 're blaming a whole religion for something that a few asshats does ? 
  that 's a bit weird . 
  now , i 'm not a fan of islam but these people are just a bunch of idiots . 
  do we blame soccer for the hooligans ? 
  since most of the younger ones are born here it 's technically their country , but that does n't give them the right to act like assholes . 
  provocation is a big deal in art . 
  the eu does n't include all of europe , and not norway where there committee that awards the peace prize is located . 
  it 's like how many american reporters do n't understand that the euro zone is n't europe , and it does n't even include all of the eu . 
  it 's really ignorant . 
  being unhappy does n't mean you think the left people are any better . 
  sd are really gaining ground now , i think that 's a pretty good indicator . 
  what ? 
  most swedes seems to like the mix of socialism and capitalism . 
  i did not praise the former government , they had pretty serious flaws in their policies as well . 
  it 's just that the flaws of the current administration are areas where the former one were better . 
  it took quite some time to implement a lot of their policies , and some have n't been implemented yet . 
  that was an interesting read , but i feel that they 're giving the current administration a bit too much credit . 
  first of all , the real effects of their cuts wo n't show for quite some time now , they 're still living on the merits of the more left-oriented one . 
  secondly , the privatisations have not been successful across the board . 
  in a lot of the cases it has simply turned into a moneymaking machine for the market , leading to higher prices and worse service for the population . 
  i do agree that privatisations can be a really good thing , but they 're not being pragmatic about it but it happens on a ideological basis . 
  it 's not good for sweden in the long run . 
  also , the way that they deal with poverty ( which means immigrants , to a large degree ) is going to become a problem . 
  we have had increasing social unrest in these groups , and lowering taxes has not generated more jobs . 
  the model for learning immigrants swedish is really flawed too , which certainly does n't help . 
  these groups feel discriminated against , and even if it was n't the intention it 's becoming a bigger and bigger problem . 
  another huge problem is how they 've reduced the disability services , and trying to get people back to work by force . 
  the idea was that it should be combined with rehabilitation efforts , which is a good idea , but it has n't been implemented nearly as often as it should . 
  this leads to a pretty oppressive disability strategy , and sick people finding themselves in poverty . 
  it may be possible for a good portion of the people on disability to work if they find work that caters to their disabilities , but these jobs do n't seem to materialise . 
  so you get part time unemployment instead . 
  these policies need to be refined quite a lot , especially improving the incentives for employers to employ part-time disabled people . 
  i feel that much of the economic gains from these policies are essentially a kind of piggy backing on selling out public property and are of a transient nature and they will lead to less efficiency much greater inequalities in the long run . 
  and worth noting is that a big part of sweden are very unhappy with these changes . 
  another straw man , interesting !, 
  that 's not what i said , i said it was impossible to talk about racism with people like you , because you will never admit to that being the driving force behind your opinions on immigration and multiculturalism . 
  that 's exactly my point !, 
  it 's why it 's impossible to have a discussion about racism and immigration . 
  these people just do n't understand . 
  no , that 's not what i said . 
  that 's a real straw man argument . 
  i even gave you an opening for discussion when i said most , but you just had to say something stupid like that . 
  you 're not making the best case for you not being part of that group , you know . 
  the problem with that discussion is that most people who talk about it that way actually are racist without realizing it . 
  i agree , but let 's call it forced marriage instead . 
  what you 're talking about is the predominant opinion in the nordic countries , and it 's quite possible that it is the most common form of arranged marriages within the immigrant populations of our area . 
  that does n't mean , however , that arrange marriages are like that everywhere . 
  i 'm willing to bet that it is n't in a majority of the cases around the world . 
  i think a lot of people do n't understand that arranged marriages can be conscensual . 
  i mean , if your relatives find you a mate that suits you well , that sounds like a pretty good deal to me . 
  as long as it 's fine to not agree to marry , that is . 
  forcing someone into marriage against their will is the problem . 
  in some cases it 's a matter of racism , some cases not . 
  that was n't my point , my point was that the structure is stacked against immigrants . 
  also , our swedish classes for immigrants ( sfi ) is terrible in most places . 
  on top of all these problems , we have structural racism . 
  it 's harder for people with foreign sounding names to get apartments in decent places and a lot harder to get jobs . 
  this is a huge part of the integration problems . 
  that 's not something you usually find in nature , though .

  salmiakki , is n't that saltlakrits ? 
  no mumintroll , though . 
  hetroed ? 
  it does not worry me . 
  i believe it will have its drawback , but we 'll hopefully gain even more . 
  we wo n't be defenceless , we 're still 500 + million in the eu , with the second largest economy . 
  it 's enough for defence , as long as we do n't face the us . 
  do n't worry , it 's only an american trope .

  it depends entirely on your idea what a european is . 
  and rest assure that different countries have different vies from yours, 
  does edinburgh count ? 
  or cdg ? 
  hmm , i lean more towards norway . 
  i guess it depends where in sweden you live . 
  if an eastern european muslim moves to the netherlands , is he then a western european muslim ?

  morality is associated with moral majority in the us , no ? 
  not in a good way , mind you . 
  yeah , so it varies , some countries are small and cramped , and some countries are not so small and less densely populated than , for instance , the us . 
  maybe you should travel around europe a bit , before you summarize it ? 
  if you 're a tourist , you will have the tourist experience . 
  the `` true '' europe varies between who you ask , and it 's different for sven living in sweden and for ole living in denmark . 
  travel , enjoy the world , live your life . 
  it 's not a competition . 
  i do n't think you can compartmentalize your life experience that way . 
  i 'm constantly experiencing europe by living here . 
  when i went to the us , i was eperiencing the us , of course . 
  but there 's no start and no end to your experience ( except birth and death , obviously ) . 
  it 's life . 
  i have a hard time believing it 's possible to experience all of europe in one lifetime . 
  or all of the us , or all of south africa , or ...

  has anyone resigned due to speeding ? 
  ca n't remember any right now, 
  i think this infraction might be seen minor in continental europe , but not so much in sweden . 
  we have a tradition of strong teetotal organisation that cleaned up the drunken sweden of the 19th century . 
  this means that there is no tradition of going down to the pub , there 's no one drinking any stronger than milk at work , and having just one beer or glass of wine at dinners etc is not common . 
  on the other hand , when it 's play time we drink a lot . 
  ( this is from my experience , others might disagree ), 
  more annoyed by the ( often ) continental europeans thinking all of europe is the same . 
  they should know better . 
  as this is askeurope , assume that we are talking about cities in europe ... ( i 've been to oakland and portland , but not cleveland . ),

  edit : just realized it 's ` americanisation '' in british english . 
  and ` realised ' ... 
  have to ask , is there a difference in pronunciation ? 
  i 've never heard of it otherwise . 
  but then again , how often does one discuss french military accomplishments in real life ? 
  all of them . 
  yes , soon . 
  until then , it 's a bit trickier . 
   and driving to portugal where * i will * live yes , they live in the us and will move to portgual . 
  they do n't live in portugal . 
  we eat reindeer ? 
  i 'll allow it . 
   we are both residents in the us, 
  well , georgia tech is legit so i do n't think the `` online '' will sound bad . 
  but call it distant learning instead , sounds much better . 
  the degree and the university is much more important . 
  but will you respect statistics ? 
  2015 had fewer reported ( to police ) cases of sexual violence and rapes in sweden than 2014 , which in turn were less than in 2013 .

  once again , your arguments work both ways ...  it 's a myth is it now ? 
  `` for in christ jesus the law of the spirit of life has set you free from the law of sin and death . '', 
  `` the days are coming , declares the lord , when i will make a new covenant ... '' `` by calling this covenant `` new , '' he has made the first one obsolete ; and what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear . '', 
  as i 've said several times , those religious scriptures are incredibly inconsistent . 
  debating fiction could go on forever . 
   i repeat : so you agree that christianity is different from islam ? 
  different religions , to a very high degree , similar . 
   is exactly what i said about you in the beginning : you 're just going on and on making zero sense whatsoever . 
  losing brain cells `` arguing '' here . 
  why are you avoiding the statement ? 
  what part did sweden play in those wars and coups ? 
  how many governments did sweden overthrow ? 
  how many wars did sweden wage ? 
  did sweden kill millions of innocent people ? 
  do people thank their soldiers for their service in iraq and vietnam when they did nothing but massacre innocent people ? 
  americans - `` everyone in the world is brainwashed but * us * , they hate us for our * freedom * '' . 
  democrat as republican , same shit . 
  do n't expect any answers , ty . 
   did they try to impose religion or not ? 
  did breivik try to impose his political views on people or not ? 
  once again , completely irrelevant . 
   they do deviate from british law . 
  i wont research if they break any british laws since it is irrelevant . 
  they do however deviate . 
  no , they do n't . 
  of course you wo n't research it lol . 
   if you look at any survey of trust in government , you 'll find sweden ranked way above the us . 
  once again , it 's easy to dislike your president when he is a reality tv star with no merits . 
  it just so happens that sweden does not have one of those . 
  americans are also the only ones stupid enough to romanticize skepticism of their government . 
  `` i need my gun for when my guvahment goes rogue '' . 
  i guess invading iraq , vietnam and like 50 other countries since ww2 under false pretenses or without consensus is not rogue enough . 
  you want so badly to think you 're in charge , but you 're far from it . 
  see :  1966  united states  lyndon b. johnson abolishes involuntary servitude . 
  you could go on all day , but thinking you lived in a modern democracy since europe was in feudal times is a perfect example of dumb fucking brainwashing . 
  once again , jim crow , 1965 . 
  do you define that as modern democracy ? 
   yes , like i said , the people i 'm referring to are n't right-wing . 
  i mean the highest-voted reply to my op on this thread was another swede who disagrees with you . 
  luckily , statistics speak volumes , someone who gets upvoted on reddit does not . 
  you live in a dream land . 
   everyone in the world does n't matter when we 're talking about cultural clash between scandinavia and islam :d i happen to be from sweden and you happen to be from denmark , but this is a bigger topic and it 's an international forum ... so yeah . 
   clearly you do n't . 
  or you would 've known the parts you were qouting are not part of the new testamente . 
  i never said i was quoting the new testament , but the new testament builds on the old testament and the old testament documents god 's punishment against sin etc. 
  this `` old testament is n't relevant '' myth is the biggest myth ever . 
   so you agree that christianity is different from islam ? 
  or what are you trying to prove by nit picking a billion other stupid shit from the bible ? 
  i started nit picking as a response to your nit picking . 
  you clearly have a problem with islam but not christianity which is hypocritical in and of itself . 
  if that is n't reactionary i do n't know what is . 
   so you agree that christianity is different from islam ? 
  or what are you trying to prove by nit picking a billion other stupid shit from the bible ? 
  once again , they are not consistent . 
  you tell me not to nit pick but you force me to and you do it yourself . 
   you can call it small and ridicule it . 
  they 're imposing their religion onto others . 
  agree ? 
  they yelled and cursed at worst and they faced jail sentences ... this is so incredibly irrelevant and i still do n't think you actually read that before linking . 
   ok , so you agree that they exist . 
  good . 
  uhm , clearly they do , but they 're not deviating from british law , so they are n't actually sharia courts as it would require that ... once again , completely irrelevant . 
  [ you posted a comment calling me an idiot and saying massachusetts outlawed slavery before sweden , then edited the idiot part out , then deleted your comment ... 
  impressive . 
  awesome :p, 
   i 'm not right-wing and the people i 'm referring to are n't right-wing . 
  you 'll have a happier life if you make a habit of refraining from unnecessary assumptions . 
  u/mrcnsrrvltng i was referring to those swedes who are keeping you up-to-date with swedish policy and education xd as i said , birds of a feather flock together . 
   no - most westerners are n't even allowed to vote for their heads of government . 
  in most western countries , it 's just whoever the party bosses decide it is . 
  the head of government typically the `` party boss '' ... must be confusing when you 're like the only developed country with a two-party system . 
   and also because they do n't vote for individuals - they just vote for parties , and are assigned representatives from lists made up by those same party bosses , representatives whose views all line up with what the bosses want , unlike our primitive system , where donald trump can become president even though the leaders of his own party hate him , because the voters - not the bosses - decide . 
  i think you forgot the part where the head of state , once again , is the head of the party and does the vast majority of party duties , i.e debates and the like . 
   this is 2017 . 
  look it up . 
  or just go over to r/politics . 
  lol , dude , americans elected him , whose fault is it ? 
   if you can say `` literally everyone knows , '' you have no business accusing any other society of brainwashing . 
  we are the longest-lived constitutional republic in existence yes i know , san marino etc. , do n't be pedantic and have been practicing modern democracy since most other westerners were in the feudal era . 
  it 's really some kind of brainwashing if `` everyone knows '' we do n't understand basic civics . 
  you just prove my point over and over again lol . 
  modern democracy while most westerners were in the feudal era ? 
  jim crow , 1965 . 
   they do impose it on others ( both muslims & non-muslims ) despite being a minority . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sharia_patrols you ca n't be serious lol ... did you even read that shit ? 
  some small group of muslim men made videos where they told people they ca n't do shit like drink and it went on for some time , they were then arrested and some of them faced jail . 
  facepalm . 
  by this logic breivik is proof that wyt pyplz are going to genocide everyone different in nazi fashion ... ridiculous . 
   religious freedom is not about each religion being able to have their own parallel society . 
  it 's about each individual having the right to believe in what he wants . 
  the moment you talk about sharia , it 's not about the individual , but the group . 
  in denmark that is certainly not allowed . 
  i ca n't imagine that not being the case elsewhere . 
  it 's called an opinion , not a good one , but it is one . 
  just because i wish i had a different pm does not mean i am planning a coup . 
   can you explain ? 
  i have no idea how that is an answer to what i wrote . 
  it 's an answer because they ca n't just do whatever they want because of their numbers , international laws and human rights exist for that exact reason . 
  it can not happen . 
   i 'm not talking about executions .

  sweden is also one of the most expensive places on earth which means a strained economy and higher tax pressure . 
  if you want these countries to go anywhere and not succumb to the evil that has grown there you should not say that braindrain is good , it 's what dooms these countries from the start . 
   so there are to a of obstacles that the region has to overcome before they can even start building a functioning immigration process . 
  not really , fighting does n't happend in all of middle east and there are plenty of safer places to start building . 
   there are a lot of things involved , housing , citizenship , food , clothes , and the prospect of a job . 
  we need to aid the development of these things , it 's both cheaper and more humane than our current policies . 
   these are all thing that sweden can take care of , though not in an unlimited fashion , of course . 
  we 've already breached the threshhold of what is possible . 
  what comes next is just to lower the quality in every manner possible . 
  we ca n't take in more refugees and immigrants without seriously harming the economy and welfare system . 
  although i 'm a bit curious , how many more do you think we have room to take in before enough is enough ? 
   tl ; dr we have the system and infrastructure to sustain this , they do n't even have a functioning state to begin developing a system that can handle the infrastructure of starting an immigration process . 
  this is false , you forget that there are more countries in the middle east than iraq and syria . 
  there are also very few reasons why we should take in people from somalia and eritrea . 
   welp , i guess we bring the wrong kind of immigrants yeah , i get the reasons that immigrants are good and they are when they have work , when they adapt to the culture and generally behave , like most european , american and eastern asian immigrants do . 
  however the kind of immigration we get drains the treasury so much that we have to cut down on our own welfare so we can afford them , and it 'll just get worse in time . 
  being generous does n't take you far if you 're stupid . 
  i was wondering when the news was gon na hit to / r/europe . 
  i do n't see the government doing good in this election and sweden democrates will probably gain a few percentages off this . 
  a lot of common people are starting to look towards sd as a neutral option when it comes to politics , even those who disagrees with them the most . 
  a lot of people are tired of coming second , third or whatever place the parties want to put the citizens of their own country in . 
  it was actually funny that the ideological opponent of the alliance said that reinfeldt was `` brave '' to come forth and say that we must embrace the refugees . 
  i really hope this zealotry will end , so the government can get some sense and start prioritizing the citizens like a government should . 
  people in sweden wo n't care until it happends here . 
  had the stockholm bomber taken people with him sd would probably be bigger and it would n't be mostly politically incorrect to talk about these problems . 
  currently people seem to care more about forcing parental leave to be equally divided . 
  i smell a battle incoming ... 
   when the scandinavians stop referring to the uk as great britain ( storbritannien/storbritannia/similar variations ) maybe we can talk about dropping similar linguistic shortcuts in english ? 
  no when we say `` storbritannien '' we refer to the uk . 
  just because `` storbritannien '' litterally means `` great britain '' does n't mean that we mean great britain . 
  i doubt sweden would invade finland . 
  denmark however could use some v\u00e4lf\u00e4rd . 
  i think we have dibs on that one . 
  it 's the same thing in sweden . 
  i 'm digressing somewhat but we have people who recently moved here who has arguments of the past and they actually bring them here . 
  christian vs muslim , muslim vs jewish bullshit which no swede want here . 
  they label these people as `` swedes vs swedes '' when that could n't be further away from the truth . 
  it 's just annoying to have to explain it and then some random idiot is very quick to say `` well they are swedes . 
  they live in sweden and have citizenship '' . 
  well yeah but if they decide to bring arguments that `` jews are inherently evil '' into the picture then no , you are n't as swedish as other swedes . 
  there is a difference , and you can surely become a swede if you cut the bullshit . 
  well , until some other swede can supply better songs i 'll just go ahead and go with [ carola ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wns4nu-boc ) and [ herreys . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfec_mrd-c ) actually i might aswell throw in some [ dota . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atjncwndub8 ), 
   * no sneakers ( unless you are excercising )  * no shorts , unless maybe you are in spain . 
  southern spain . 
  maybe . 
  why ? 
  so tell us , what can we do to help integrate more people ? 
  we 're actually giving a lot of them a place to stay , free education , a lot of grants and freedom of living in a western world . 
  do you not believe it 's up to the immigrants to adapt to the society rather than the society adapting to the immigrants ? 
  the thing is , there are a lot of different types of muslims , and some just refuse to integrate even with all of the chances given . 
  some just dispite western culture and honestly , that 's okay , but not if you want to live in a western society . 
  i 'm in . 
  nordic union and then union with baltics would be great . 
  small steps are best . 
  yeah sorry , i wrote in affect . 
  also profanity is unnecessary . 
  i 'm saying that the poverty and poor education is n't as bad as you make it out to be . 
  people are n't living on the streets begging for food and have actually right for grants and welfare . 
  they also recieve education for free . 
  again , your claim is just full of shit and lack reality . 
  muslims are n't behaving badly because of poverty or poor education and it 's a bullshit claim to make . 
   again , are you claiming that the netherlands has zero poverty and zero poor education ? 
  prove me otherwise . 
  please link articles which states that schools are fundamentally bad and that the muslims are suffering because of it . 
  also link to articles which states that muslims are living in poverty in the netherlands . 
  i claim that relative to the rest of the world they are not . 
  even grant takers in netherlands have more money than poles in poland with a job . 
  the school system in the netherlands is actually good . 
  according to oced they 're 9th best in the world which is above sweden . 
  also it 's not up to the netherlands to give them a better life , it 's up to themselves . 
  the netherlands can only do so much before it comes down to the individuals on how to pay back to the society . 
  of course not , because actually admitting your mistake would be so frustrating for you to do . 
  i was actually trying to help you and give you a way out but you 're just too stubborn to admit fault . 
  very well , be that way . 
  you 're claiming that poverty , rundown areas and poor education lead to extremism . 
  are you claiming the netherlands has a lot of poverty and poor education ? 
  if you could just see a little bit beyond that you would realize you 're full of shit . 
   most of these people turn into radicals and extremists because they 're from poor or rundown areas and have poor education . 
  was osama bin laden poor ? 
  somehow saudi arabia , one of the most oil rich countries in the world , is one of the most extreme in their ideology . 
   how the hell is this saying they all muslims the same thing ? 
  are you incapable of seeing oxymorons ? 
  you 're speaking against yourself . 
  you ca n't believe the same thing while not believing the same thing . 
  you 're claiming that every muslim believe in the same thing . 
  obviously this is n't true and i do n't know if you just used poor wording or if it was something else . 
  are you saying that every muslim has the same basis for their beliefs , or are you saying that the beliefs are the same ? 
   you realize not every muslim believes the exact same things and that the interpretations are widely different ? 
  are you actually implying that you believe in the same thing as isis ? 
  obviously lingua franca is important , but not being able to express yourself in your mother tongue is , weird to say the least . 
  by that logic one should just switch the language entirely so everyone can communicate . 
  i had to learn some terminology in latin , swedish and english when i studied , and while it was annoying it was necessary for me to continue with my studies in sweden . 
  all 3 were used but by far the least used was english . 
  sure it 's a bit frustrating when i know the terminology in swedish but not english but i 'd rather know it in swedish than english . 
  the best way as i see it is to teach courses in german and teach important terminology in english aswell as german . 
  we 're capitalists ? 
  geez thanks for telling me how the society is around here . 
  i must 've missed it somehow .

  i know the whole greek economy is not solely due to inefficiency and corruption but it is a big part , and it will hinder you . 
  ( there are several factors , the construction of the euro is one ) so , why not work on that instead of blaming other people . 
  and . 
  no it is not a strawman . 
  essentially you always blame the euro countries as soon it is not perfect . 
  guess what - painful reforms never are and if you have to make hundreds , some of them will be idiotic . 
  greece could have minimised that by actually reforming it public sector themselves , fight against corruption before and become more effective . 
  however , you choose not to . 
  why i never know . 
  so , why do n't the greeks suggest something far more effective ? 
  you can hardly not reform , can you ? 
  for god 's sake , if you avoid doing stuff for decades it is not going to be nice when you finally do it . 
  it is hardly the fault of the eu . 
  while your public sector is inefficient - you still want to keep people , i guess not to make them unemployed . 
  guess what - that costs . 
  do n't blame your public finances on the eu . 
  why did you build up that sector in the first place ? 
  blame your parents . 
  how is more coal and gas instead of nuclear `` green '' ? 
  but you do need structural reforms , there is no doubt about it , and you have needed it for decades . 
  are you saying that greece should n't do it ? 
  why should n't greece reform their public sector for example . 
  it is inefficient and bloated . 
  well , i think they have been doing worse than us for something like five years now if i recall correctly . 
  i am sure nokia factors in , but it can not be the sole reason . 
  poland is a fairly big economy , is n't it ? 
  seriously , i would n't bail out any bank with any money the way the euro countries does it . 
  * especially * not with tax payers money . 
  not demanding collateral is a bloody insult to tax payers and downright stupid . 
  what ? 
  the danes have complained and the swedes have answered with increasing the number of medical students in sweden ( or at least we are going to from 2015 or something ) . 
  i think we should blame the norwegians , or my favourite , the finns . 
  honestly , i do n't think there are loopholes that are that simple . 
  our politicians might not be the brightest all of the time , but the laws are drafted by people who has studied law and probably thought of the fact that someone could go outside the schengen area for a week or two . 
  wait until september next year . 
  which part is that ? 
  ca n't see on my phone ... 
  i think you have to wait a long time to see some real debates about the eu - election in sweden . 
  in particular since we are having our own elections as well in september 2014 . 
  it annoys me . 
  even if one does n't like the eu , one should vote is my opinion . 
  vote for someone who does n't like it then . 
  or , just vote goddammit . 
  what is the situation in your countries ? 
  in sweden a ) very few vote to the ep even though we normally have between 75-80 % in our elections . 
  in the ep , maybe 30 % . 
  b ) people do not understand that it is somewhat different in brussels than in sweden so they vote for the same party they always have , even though their interests would be better served by voting for someone else . 
  does anyone else have that phenomenon ? 
  it is not very expensive to buy msc - fish , i am a student and i do it . 
  also , if you worry about what they feed them there are organisations that keep track of that , go online . 
  not sure what they are called in france , but i am certain you have them . 
  i often buy norwegian salmon for example . 
  why do n't you eat grown/raised fish ? 
  or msc fish ? 
  yes , of course , but that at least can be fixed over time . 
  they will not be extinct , some perhaps , but rarer . 
  good , everybody is overfishing , europe as well . 
  we are however , overfishing less than we used too . 
  some of it is probably because we fish in africa , but some of it it truly that we are aiming for more sustainable fishing practises . 
  i think norway and iceland are doing fairly well in that regard if i recall correctly . 
  and , if you eat ( european eel ) stop it - immediately !, 
  well , if they need to eat them , it should go under the cap . 
  not under `` cultural heritage '' . 
  if one considers how paranoid some of their leaders were/are , i am sure they have spied on themselves hell , the fighting among leading communists makes the political fights in the west seem like kindergarten . 
  the least they have done is spied :-) . 
  no shit . 
  we have been doing it since the cold war and sharing it with nato . 
  finland too , and austria too i suspect . 
  not to mention all the nato countries . 
  is there anyone who has n't spied on russia ? 
  no , and it should also be mentioned that she was chosen by lo , our biggest union who is not in bed with , but married to , the social democrats . 
  i did write more specific in my long answer as an example of why sweden do n't want to participate more with the eu . 
  read that part ( it is the first part ) and explain to me not only why the eu did it , but why no one protested and you are all fine with that . 
  why did n't you demand collateral ? 
  buhu , blame it on someone else . 
  it is sweden 's fault that our bank saves sucks . 
  if not for sweden we could grow more tobacco . 
  we refuse to be scientific , but let us blame that on sweden . 
  buhuuu answer me at least about the bank saves - who the fuck does bank saves without demanding collateral . 
  why did you ? 
  why did you transfer all the debt to the tax payers , without collateral ? 
  how can you defend that ? 
  you caused it and above all you keep on making it worse by discrimination , by being in the pockets of banks , by rejecting science and ignoring the rules and common sense . 
  instead of fixing it you whine and bitch about sweden , when we refuse to participate in the next idiotic endeavour . 
  grow up , stop bitching and use some common sense and fix stuff . 
  you caused it , now fix it . 
  is n't every single tradition ( idiotic or not ) cultural heritage ? 
  i do n't understand why the eu should spend money on that - would n't our money be far better spent on the future , stuff like research and education ? 
  if the bullfighting ca n't survive on its own , maybe it should die out . 
  same for other traditions . 
  what ? 
  all we are saying is that we do not want the eu to speak for us in matters of national security . 
  it makes sense , since we have not signed over put national security to the eu , nor has anyone else . 
  why should someone who has no authority over me negotiate for me ? 
  madame , but thank you anyway . 
  ps , i understand you have no evidence for anything , but ca n't you at least explain to me how sweden is responsible for * snowden * , which you claimed . 
  haha , so you have nothing . 
  why am i elitist btw and what did we do to snowden ? 
  please , it seems you have no evidence . 
  post links from reputable sources or you are just another conspiracy nut .

  long may he reign !, 
  based on what my romanian friend has said there are a lot more factors than just money that is pushing emigration .

  the blue ones were particularly awesome . 
  gothenburgers do not like stockholm and stockholmers very much , no . 
  netflix , spotify premium , hbo and c more . 
  i also share a viaplay account with someone . 
  i 'll unsubscribe from c more after this month though , it 's not worth paying half of what my season ticket costs every month just to watch my clubs away matches . 
  they literally do n't have anything else in their sports package that interests me and their selection of films is mediocre . 
   but seriously , trying to alienate and look down on people that do not live at university campus only makes you look like a dick . 
  so does looking down upon the people who live at a university campus . 
   i 'd say , the more shit talking about stockholm , the more statistically likely it is that the person is a `` redneck '' . 
  you 've never been to gothenburg , obviously .

  in terms of clothing a baseball cap would be just about the last thing that would identify someone as an american . 
  but i bet you love knives !, 
  this is reddit , you 're meant to say darude - sandstorm !, 
  this suffers from having been made by a ( judging by the default answers presumably conservative ) american , thus restricting it to issues considered important by americans and answers to those issues that are common in american political debate . 
  notice how there is no option for a constitutional monarchy , even though it is the form of government for some of the world 's most successful democracies , or any option to omit a minimum wage in favour of collective bargaining ? 
  then there is the issue with the nonsensical application of sliders . 
  it 's like how it was playing football manager before they introduced the player roles , you just pulled the sliders right or left without having any fucking clue of what that did or what the slider was meant to represent . 
  `` agriculture funding 50 % '' ? 
  50 % of what ? 
  50 % of gdp ? 
  50 % of the government budget ? 
  50 % of all agricultural production ?

   i think most new cars are sold with a automatic transmission nowadays . 
  probably true for sweden , but not europe as a whole . 
  we buy larger and more expensive cars than most other europeans , as / u/explosivemachine pointed out elsewhere in the thread the smaller , cheaper models that dominate the market on most of the continent often are n't available with automatic transmission . 
  for a long time manual cars were much more fuel efficient than automatic , performance was better and most significantly they were cheaper . 
  all of these are less of an issue now than they used to be thanks to technological advances , but old habits die hard . 
  / u/explosivemachine has pointed out the key factor though , that you ca n't get a full driving licence without knowing how to drive a manual car . 
  it is no use to anyone that a manual accelerates to 100 a second faster , gets further on a single tank of fuel and costs two grand less than an automatic car if nobody knows how to drive one .

  i read [ hillbilly elegy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hillbilly_elegy ) by j.d. 
  vance between christmas and new year and found it pretty interesting . 
   it 's always better than this weird machine that lets the inside of food cold and the plate burning as hell you 're using it wrong . 
  they would n't have anything to be resentful about . 
  the upper classes used to be pretty serious germanophiles , that stopped after the war and the anglo and americophilia that was already widespread in the lower classes took over , but resentment ? 
  germany simply fell from being a place thought of as admirable to a country like any other . 
  yeah , they charge flag carrier rates for low-cost levels of service . 
  the last time i flew with them the stingy fuckers wanted over 600 kr to check-in a bag unless you did it two days in advance and in case you got thirsty a tiny can of coke was over 70 kr . 
  people in the thread are being really critical of ba , but sas make them seem like the greatest airline in the world by comparison . 
  free food and drink used to be a staple of flag carrier service , though many of them have cut back on it over the last 20 years or so as a budget measure . 
  more prestigious flag carriers like lufthansa , air france , klm etc. 
  still do it . 
   they offer no food or drink at all for free on short haul which is fair enough have they changed policy since last summer ? 
  because i got free food and drink when i flew with them from paris to london and from london to gothenburg . 
  anyway , i 'm surprised to see someone writing negatively about ba not mentioning their issues with delays . 
  they use heathrow as their hub , which causes serious issues with delays because that airport is in dire need of expansion . 
  there are so many beck and wallander films at this point that they both practically make up genres of their own . 
  eggs , pickled herring , meatballs and prinskorv , basically the usual sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord stuff that gets eaten at every major holiday , including christmas and midsummer . 
  my local shop had that stuff on sale for weeks ahead of easter . 
  did n't seem to be very popular as the same sad packet of it was left untouched on the same shelf in the refrigerator . 
  in the laundry room . 
  it 's more common and entrenched into the local identity here , you 're not going to find many other cities where literally every place has at least one witty pun as a nickname . 
   matador , is a true classic , everybody has seen it . 
  my danish friend disagreed and referred to it as `` a show for old people '' when i asked her about it a few weeks ago . 
  it has nothing to do with governments fucking up , it 's just the way pension schemes are set up in most of the world , they were all designed under the assumption that working people would always outnumber pensioners , the way demographics has changed over the last 70 years and continues to change that will not be the case for very long . 
  or the famous [ industrial waste ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/c\u00eeroc ) !, 
  you can drink the former sunderland manager ? 
  for uniquely swedish alcohol there 's [ punsch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/punsch ), 
  having been born in the 90s i hold no hope of ever receiving a single \u00d6re from the public pension system , our generation will be lucky to get public pensions when we are 75 + , if ever . 
  i have confidence that the part of the pension fund that is invested in investment funds will pay out , but this forms such a small part of the overall public pension system compared to the unsustainable tax-based part that i have a hard time seeing very many living off of it alone . 
  i put money into a handful of index funds each month with the intention of eventually retiring early . 
  i put away enough that i should be able to retire at 55 or so and live the rest of my life in relative comfort unless something really unusual happens to the global stock market within the next 25 years . 
  if i get lucky i guess i might even be able to retire at 45 or 50 .

  we 're no utopia , we have our issues like any country . 
  but anyone who claims sweden is an islamist hellhole , sure is disconnected from reality . 
  and ca n't possibly have ever been here . 
   norwegian is really only spoken in norway , although i believe swedes and to a lesser degree danes get some norwegian on their broadcasting channels . 
  not much honestly . 
  we 've got skavlan who , let 's face it , more often than not speaks svorsk . 
  i think ylvis was on some channel for a bit . 
  but , i do n't know , it 's not much anyhow . 
  we 've got more danish programming , but that too is almost non-existent . 
   it seems that the english-speaking world is unusually connected . 
  there 's absolutely nothing strange about an american who only watches british shows , an australian who visits american news sites , etc. 
  overall , there 's very little we do n't share with each other . 
  there 's absolutely nothing strange about a swede doing those things either . 
  heck , most of our programming is american or british of origin . 
  i 've seen some canadian and aussie shows on the telly as well . 
  there 's very little you do n't share with us either . 
  now , the same might not be true in the other direction ... 
   swedes would have more power than the others because of their population being larger , and that would cause problems . 
  i personally believe some clever person would find a solution to this problem though ... democratically there really is n't . 
  either all votes are equal , in which case sweden has more , or they 're weighted , in which case a swede 's vote will be worth less . 
  but that is if you group by nationality , which often is n't warranted . 
  just looking at myself i agree more with copenhagen than stockholm on * a lot * of issues , but i 'd still fall under the category of `` swedish '' . 
  we are after all culturally similar . 
  tl ; dr : no need to read this , i derailed again ... 
  thank you for the compliment . 
   -- why thank you !, 
   but ... well , i studied english a hl of the international baccalaureate ( higher level english for native speakers ) . 
  the same english education an ib student in britain would get if they chose higher level . 
  few people here go the ib , even fewer choose english a ( rather than b ) , and fewer still are stupid enough to decide on doing it higher level ... 
  but , when i make mistakes it 's most likely because of temporary brain malfunction or typos etc. , not lack of knowledge . 
  honestly , i make more mistakes in swedish than english . 
  but , yeah , our english is pretty good in general . 
  it 's a combination of things . 
  primary school 's compulsory ( year 1-9 ) , and english ( along with maths and swedish ) is a `` core subject '' you * must * pass to graduate . 
  and while year 9 english wo n't make you a linguist , it sure will be good enough for a conversation . 
  in addition , we 're a `` sub-not-dub '' culture . 
  and with the exception of cartoons specifically targeting young children , we do not voice-dub media . 
  which exposes us to more english than certain countries . 
  the same is true for all of scandinavia really . 
  also , internet penetration is * strong * here ( [ sort by percentage and count scandinavian crosses ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_number_of_internet_users ) ) , while we 're not populous enough to have a well-developed `` national internet-culture '' , so we end up browsing the english-speaking web . 
  but , we [ too ] ( https://youtu.be/uaszbm1cp5k?t=4s ) have [ people ] ( https://youtu.be/rt6cu_igf-4?t=4s ) who might not speak english as `` flawlessly '' . 
  mostly among the older generation though , but still . 
  i think some of that prejudice has to do with confirmation bias and availability heuristic . 
  i 've been googling to find them , but all i can find now is [ this ] ( http://www.norden.org/en/news-and-events/news/surprisingly-strong-support-for-united-nordic-federation ) , which does n't have the specific numbers of the result , nor is it what i remember . 
  the question is n't entirely right , it seems to more about cooperation than federation . 
  i read it in a magazine on the topic . 
  i 'm fairly certain their source was oxford research too , on mission from the nordic council . 
  and sifo . 
  but i ca n't find it now . 
  until i do i 'll edit my original comment , so it is n't disingenuous . 
  i 'm sorry , but i 'll try to find it . 
  i too would love it . 
  but ... as much as i would like to say yes , i 'm not sure it 'd work too well . 
  i 'm afraid the population difference would create a democratically skewed power structure either one way or the other . 
  we 've got three countries of about 5,5 mi . 
  people , one with almost twice of that and one with only a fraction . 
  either iceland gets no power , or swedes get little power per capita . 
  then there 's the issue of eu . 
  icelands only been toying with the idea , and the general populace of norway is still quite against it . 
  all while the other three are in general quite content with it . 
  also political system , three kindoms and two republics . 
  what do we go with ? 
  where would the capital ( s ) be ? 
  and policies . 
  we would dislike danish car taxes , danes would loathe an alcohol monopoly etc. 
  also , quite a few people are fairly nationalistic and would despise `` losing '' their sovereignty . 
  it 's only 72 years since iceland truly became independent from just denmark , about 100 years since finland gained their own sovereignty and 110 years since norway broke out of the union with sweden . 
  i personally would like it , but i 'm not sure how realistic it is . 
   a shame so many of our artists writes in english imo . 
  actually , i agree . 
  it is unfortunate . 
  i think that 's part of my problem with them , is that it feels a bit ... uncanny ? 
  since i 'm not used to it . 
  but i also find the general quality of swedish lyrics worse , but that may just be because i 'm pickier compared to english . 
  some musicians do write great lyrics in swedish , but in my experience they 're in the minority . 
   i 've watched scandinavian comedy once do you remember what it was called , or about ? 
   `` l\u00e5t den r\u00e4tte komma in '' is one of the best movies i 've watched . 
  been thinking of watching that one as i 've heard some great reviews , but i do n't know , have n't gotten around to it yet . 
  not a big fan of swedish cinema , tv or such . 
  i do think we 've had some great music . 
  and ... some abhorrent . 
  i tend to find lyrics in swedish a bit off-putting , for whatever reason , and prefer them to be in english . 
  but there are some exceptions . 
  well yeah , you would n't just make assumptions . 
  if you know they 're british but not from which country , of course you refer to them as such . 
  but i would n't make assumptions of them being british if i did n't know that either . 
  and i would never include the irish under that umbrella ... 
  i interpreted your comment as saying `` we refer to all of them as british , so we do n't have to differentiate incase we ever ca n't tell the difference '' or something . 
  the  but even then , i think we like to distinguish between the different countries and nationalities on the british isles if we are able to . 
  -- part was n't there when i wrote my reply . 
  you must 've edited it in after i 'd started replying . 
  yeah , that first part is what i meant . 
  but , in general , i find wales being referred to more of a region of england , unlike scotland which is always recognized by itself . 
  if someone goes to england and wales , they 'll probably just say they 're going to england . 
  and if they go to scotland , england and wales , they 'll say they 're visiting `` scotland and england '' , wales is kind of lumped together with england . 
  unless you 're specifically going to just wales . 
  --  but when talking about the people it 's much more common to just bunch you all up as `` brits '' , since a lot of us ca n't really tell the difference when meeting you . 
  probably even the irish , sorry . 
  not sure about that though , at least not where i 'm from . 
  in general i think people refer to scottish , english and irish individually .

  also open up your own home for the refugees please because it 's damn easy to spend public money and national efforts to feel good about your good deed for the day but it is n't as cut and dry when it comes to your own personal belongings . 
  always a no-brainer to have someone else deal with the problems for the sake of morality . 
  see it 's all so simple in your world , people are either with you or against you huh ? 
  well go back to my first request and ponder the consequences , your money will be sucked up by a black hole that only keeps growing as the word spreads between the worlds misfortuned , your garden and your home will be slowly degenerating into an ethnic ghetto and tensions will keep growing between your other family members and your new ones . 
  now imagine your situation on a national level and maybe you can understand why i 'm glad people like you are n't in charge . 
  you 're an idealist and you ca n't be bothered with reality - simple as that . 
  tss , idealists like you used to annoy me but nowadays i just feel smug . 
  there are tens of millions of refugees in the world right now , most of these are domestic ones meanning they are displaced within their own country . 
  exemplifying the syrian refugee situation almost all relocate to neighbouring countries where they live in camps waiting to return home . 
  unfortunately the regional war has become infected with various islamist groups so the war is n't ending anytime soon , hence some of the people will seek asylum in other parts of the world - and who can blame them ? 
  but remember that this is mostly to improve their quality of life not to actually escape death . 
  bcause when they 've made it to europe they 're already out of harms way . 
  naive people like you usually frame the debate as if the migration office is supposed to pick and choose which ones live and which ones die but that 's not how it works . 
  for the sake of argument , however , let 's say that this is the case and all these people are in imminent danger . 
  people like you would say that this justifies a lot of asylum grants but what number is ethical ? 
  you will say `` as many as possible '' is the humane goal but here 's the crux : there will always be people on the run , or at least for the forseeable future , so this refugee policy will have to be permanent . 
  i ask you then will you reform your own country into a global social office/ngo organization or will you turn - insert noun accosiated with racism here - and keep the status quo ? 
  now i pick the latter , for the same reason i do n't hand every roma beggar i see the keys to my house . 
  obviously i wish these people a better life but i 'm not idealistic about it - i 'm * realistic * . 
  yes , yes if refugees are properly integrated then there is of course no problem . 
  however african and middle eastern regugees have a quite poor track record in this case . 
  far more lucrative is labor migration and asylum seekers screened for those with a higher education . 
  the odd success story does little to help the problems in a macro perspective . 
  nobody wants refugees , it 's like throwing money in the lake and all you get in return is a lot of social issues and tensions that are ripe for populist parties . 
  the less refugees the better . 
  somehow they look really finnish , i do n't know what it is . 
  and i have always suspected that spain has , probably , the most potential to be a rich and competitive economy out of all the southern european countries . 
  i 've only become more convinced since spain has been , at least relatively , proactive in pursuing economic and structural reforms since the euro debt crisis . 
  the terrorists call themselves terrorists ? 
  fact checking not even once, 
  sweden have higher gdp per capita than both denmark and finland and that 's despite the recent immigration wave . 
  we should invest our public funds sensibly , like russia . 
  this would be unthinkable in northern europe . 
  i see you follow the debate, 
  not without looking through the statistics but i know about 4 % of the population identify as muslim and about 16 % are christian . 
  these groups vary in just how pious they are but overall people are n't very religious at all in sweden . 
  oh , and a large part of the middle eastern/african immigrants are actually christians from assyria or congo etc. 
  you should n't be too reassured as this really is a big issue for sweden , the immigration have been unplanned , too large , poorly implemented and worst of all : immune to critisism . 
  this is gon na take some time to clean up but like an alchoholic we have barely recognized that we 've got a problem to begin with . 
  funny you should say that because that 's usually what they do over a span of maybe 2-3 generations . 
  my high school was a cross with people from my very swedish area and students from an immigrant neighbourhood and about half of all arabs/africans in my class were atheists the other half was secular . 
  a few kids wore a muslim scarf but they tapped their iphones and gossiped like all teh other girls . 
  only one bitch was actually muslim , she went on about homosexuality being wrong and no one liked her . 
  that said there are some psycho terrorist imams that preach , well , extreme terrorist ideology and weirdly enough they 're indirectly funded by the state as a part of the social programs for the suburbs . 
  that kind of shit makes me wan na outlaw that whole shitty religion and be done with it . 
  now you 're starting to sound weird . 
  let me put it this way : in the 1960 's there was a huge number of italian and greek immigrants that came here but nowadays you literally ca n't tell the would-be italians/greek from the `` ethnic '' swedes because they act just the same and they look just the same . 
  this is successful integration , and sooner or later most of the middle eastern or african immigrants will be swedish as well . 
  you 'll see their heritage in their different features like black skin or big noses but that does n't matter to the civilized part of the world . 
  the only thing that does matter is that they will become part of society , if you 're the kind of person that gets thrown into a fit whenever you see a black guy then sweden will never be for you again , but if you appreciate a good citizen with decent values then you 're welcome to become swedish as well . 
  we got ta ditch this rubbish idea of `` multiculturalism '' along with a lot of other stuff first though . 
  i 'll give you this : the immigration and integration policy has been an ongoing fiasco for the last 20 years and it 's gon na take another 20 years to clean up this mess . 
  right now , a lot of people wo n't even recognize that it 's all a big fail though so plenty of work to be done . 
  nice finnish design . 
  that 's it finns . 
  is that why the swedish hdi ranking rose by one pont this year ? 
  it could also be interesting to note that sweden has n't noticed a drop in living standards in the last decade , actually quality of life increased more than in most other oecd countries . 
  yeah , sure the immigration system needs to be reformed but that 's about all you got right . 
  but you know what , how about both of us check back in a decade and we 'll see how those `` predictions '' hold up ? 
  damn you 're stoopid . 
  below croatia in 10 years ? 
  seems legit , or maybe you 're joking ? 
  they 're a mountain people , like the swiss . 
  they do n't want much to do with the rest of us . 
  heh , the finns are kind of crazy . 
  russians got rekt . 
  sweden 4ever russkis, 
  0.5 to 0.6 percent ? 
  wow ... 
  lol you do n't know how good you have it . 
  denmark , but why is it always another swede making a post about immigration , are you guys really so hot for that crap ? 
  the amount of energy is n't important , only how it 's produced . 
  since 1990 energy demand has risen sharply but co2 emissions has dropped . 
  are the kremlin trolls here as well ? 
  fine what about sweden then , as of this year 60 % of our power is from renewable sources . 
  that was n't the case 40 years ago . 
  you can very well sustain a stagnant population though , also no reason we have to consume natural recourses at the current rate . 
  the us uses 40 % less coal today than it did in 1960 but the population has nearly doubled . 
  how was this measured , number of start-ups or patents ? 
  first of all : the ukrainian army ( which has n't mobilized in its entirety ) are fighting both rebels that have been armed and trained by russian soldiers but also against russian troops - in direct confrontation . 
  the russian army is better trained , better equipped and has an extenisve consistent line of supplies and reinforcments . 
  ukraine needs : more and better weapons , modern vehicles including tanks and airplanes , time to organize a defence , competent leadership which is sorely lacking and most of all help from other armies . 
  spot on, 
  unfortunately ukraine will still be losing the war , they wo n't be able to prevail against russian forces without actual intervention from other nations . 
  lol at denmark , i do n't know if i love them or hate them . 
  lol at denmark , they got ta be trolling at this point . 
  alright thanks maybe i 'll go there . 
  i 'm planning on living in holland or belgium for a little while and i 'm torn as to where exactly . 
  k man thanks, 
  one last question then : amsterdam or rotterdam ? 
  cool , do you feel short in the netherlands ? 
  i mean are the dutch as tall as they say ? 
  planning on living there for a year or so and it would be fun to know . 
  me too man , how tall are you ? 
  i 'm 186, 
  the value of having a central bank is n't really speculation and as for value , i do n't know if you 're aware but it 's mistakes like this that we learn from . 
  where would we be today if people had n't been allowed to speculate ? 
  yes , see the cheap loans are part of the problem are n't they . 
  yes it 's probably impossible to break it up by now . 
  not really , a national monetary policy would have been a definitive advantage for most countries in the euro region .

  only # 1 and # 7 qualify , # 7 is the best . 
  peasants had rights in medieval sweden while in many other european countries , they were trapped in a feudal system . 
  it 's one example of a longstanding tradition , but i do n't know what to call it ; it was n't democratic , nor socialist . 
  nice video . 
  it 's like cgp grey , but better . 
  this is a straw man argument , because no conspiracy is claimed . 
  it is legitimate to describe a party 's actions and its implications . 
  there is no real claim as to * why * bbc has acted this way , just that it * does * and that doing so is ( allegedly ) not objective reporting . 
   `` there are many adjectives one can apply to the bbc 's behavior here : `` objective '' and `` neutral '' are most assuredly not among them . '', 
  i just learned that [ * there are 36,681 communes in france * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communes_of_france ) . 
  wow !, 
  is that going to be reorganized too ? 
   as the accomplice of bush in dragging the west into this * debacle * i think ** war ** is a good word for it . 
  100,000 dead iraqis during the conflict , disorder , chaos , refugees ... war should cover it . 
  how can he rule if he 's busy larping all the time ? 
  i 'm actually not a clog expert , especially not on the global reach of clogs . 
  are `` swedish '' clogs a sweden ( and close area around ) only thing ? 
  never thought about it . 
  please do n't address redditors as if they are official representatives of their flag flair . . 
  everyone knows australia is a continent , curious minds will want to know what other german speaking countries are continents too !, 
  we need a strong antisepptic !, 
  it 's eeuu when written though . 
  it 's freaking weird to give awards to government officials of another country , while they are still in office . 
  americans will appreciate that the tax authority declares people dead . 
  i mean , combining the two certain things into one . 
  do n't you see that more southern europe = more drugs ? 
  the solution is easy , ban southern europe . 
  the nordic agreements mean that social services are available to all nordic nationals in finland . 
  this is more generous than the european union agreements , and thus the jobless swede is welcome by default .

  now would be the time for a brit athlete to do this , if they wanted to make a splash . 
  i guess most of them do n't want to involve politics . 
  i do n't think the sentiment of english being `` your '' language is that strong anymore , it 's a world language now . 
  there must be some kind of political theory about why it was acceptable to reduce it so much . 
  anyway , it was a big bucket of budget money that each government could take from to fund the popular thing they wanted to do . 
  economics is political . 
  it 's not bias , it 's politics . 
  absolutely . 
  it 's his best series ever , and it 's very gripping . 
  88 % , i love quizzes . 
  i 've never even been to uk really , but i guess i 'm ready to invade . 
  the 2 millennia old coin on a coin is my favourite ( greek $ 1 ), 
  that 's going to change when the twilight generation comes into power . 
  having family in both countries , it is a bit heart breaking to look at this and seeing the countries going opposite ways . 
  even though we of course have a lot of very important things in common including the nordic treaties . 
  in russia , the mafia in charge has basically eradicated actual politics . 
  do n't worry , the financial system has been fixed , there are new regulations , and there wo n't be any recessions again . . / s, 
  it 's their standard propaganda , pretty boring . 
  big breweries in sweden and denmark really do n't have much to offer . 
  mikkeller is great , and there 's a lot more diversity beers like that in denmark that are interesting . 
  i think i prefer the german beers in fact when it comes to lager . 
  ( which is not a surprise since german beer culture is basically a competition where everyone is making the same beer the best they can . ), 
  spanish beer is totally normal lager beer and it 's good to me . 
  the lowest level court is also called tingsr\u00e4tt ( hovr\u00e4tt , h\u00f6gsta domstolen are the two above ), 
  it rather seems to be the reverse , a language without a country has no power to protect itself . 
  and when it has power , it often suppresses the regional minority languages . 
  irish is a privileged and empowered language to have the protection of a country , very few languages are like that !, 
  ( even if the country in question does n't seem to regard it as its most important language . ), 
  there are lots of awesome things about eu . 
  just remember that being a big empire is not how we measure success . 
  it 's very hard for schengen to happen . 
  scotland should obviously primarily be in a passport union with the countries on the same island . 
  like some ukrainians said , betrayed by a brother . 
  that 's how you get more than 100 %, 
  1970s version of `` capitalism '' is not the same version we are using now . 
  not in sweden , not in other europe . 
  \u00d6 and \u00d8 are equivalent , so it 's no big deal . 
  they found these four positive people at least http://www.sydsvenskan.se/2017-03-02/malmoungdomar-positiva-till-varnplikt, 
  one of the very popular corruption indices is just based on perceived corruption . 
  i do n't like it since it skews the results ( only some kinds of corruption are noticeable ) . 
  i like that , that differences in pronunciation are visible . 
  how did iceland end up with \u00e6 and \u00f6 ? 
  just that it 's a mix of swedish and danish choices for those . 
  you can have many of the same one instead !, 
  norwegian has somewhat more common accent usage than swedish , to separate homonyms for example * for * ( english : for ) and * f\u00f4r * ( english : fodder ) . 
  oh god someone please fix the y axis . 
  i wonder where the laptop ranks . . 
  kickbacks ? 
  easy way to funnel away money , is my guess . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/greece-corruption-trial-idusl5n0vl3v820150211 this is international corruption , facilitated not just by politicians that take bribes but companies that pay them out ( which is usually illegal ) . 
  edit : http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/complicit-in-corruption-how-german-companies-bribed-their-way-to-greek-deals-a-693973.html, 
  and forest . 
  lots of trees . 
  rest of northern europe and the netherlands maybe ? 
  interesting news , uninteresting angle . 
  farmer , difficulty : ~ ~ hell ~ ~ norway . 
  there is both hope and despair in this , how often we hear about things that only change because a new generation was taught something different . 
  if we want to change something big ( corruption and so on ) we need generations !, 
  my parents have made me understand that this kind of change happened to make people stop throwing garbage in nature , too . 
  i think debit cards are the absolute rule in sweden too . . 
  ah so maybe i can find lots of og that agree with me, 
  why did the germans decide that it was correct to write three l ( * `` ell '' * ) in a row , it looks so wrong . . ? 
  like this : * volllaststunden *, 
  the original memeification with the song & the leek was before youtube and all that . 
  it was a flash thing like this http://leekspin.com/, 
  the `` rational '' month names are really nice , too . 
  it would n't be news if the pony just stuck to the rules and had its bike . 
  there 's no reason to not have horse meat in them except that it should be declared somewhere what the food item contains . 
  it 's the normal name in norway . 
  it sounds a lot more original than the swedish name .

  being left in an orphanage till your 18/21 and risk being social misfits , fall into crime , develop mental issues or have 2 hairy men who likes to knit and decorate that love you despite not being able to make their own children . 
  those who are against same sex adoption do n't really care for the orphans and do n't care to adopt either . 
  no , this is the reason i 'm excited for the future and hopeful for the eu . 
  checked your history . 
  do n't try undermine the eu in a european sub . 
  i do n't get why you see us as enemies when we 're just happy to make it on our own . 
  i do n't normally call people out like this but the active atempt to take the wind out of anything positive about europe is getting under my skin . 
  you said and i quote '' [ trump wants europe to stand on its own . 
  time to kick the kid out of the basement and tell him to get a job '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5sds2u/eurozone_economy_quietly_outshines_the_us_stream/ddei851/ ) . 
  so now we 're well on our way to do so but for some fucking reason you do n't like it ? 
  you have rightwing retards reading their favorit propaganda piece because `` mainstream media is just libtard lies !!!! '' . 
  it gets shared on facebook . 
  people of lesser education who 's already angry at the muslims and the oh so super corrupt govermemt latches on . 
  even if it is just by reading the title . 
  that 's all it needs . 
  someone to tell you you 're opressed , someone else to tell you who 's at fault and bam . 
  no facts no debate . 
  just feelings and a title . 
  we 're doing okay !, 
  seriously though . 
  that 's great news in uncertain times . 
  always buy local . 
  if not , buy european . 
  wow ... 
  the bitterness in here . 
  it 's like you do n't want the union to work . 
  it 's like you want it to fail . 
  i support the idea of a union . 
  heck , even a federalization is in order . 
  i belive in europe and us europeans . 
  what the union needs is a reform of how mandates are distributed among its memebers . 
  right now it 's all located on france and germany . 
  whilte they are the economic power houses and should have more to say , i do n't agree with the overwhelming mandates they currently have . 
  the migrant crisis made it clear that 1 woman have too much to say and everyone is still to selfish and nationalistic for this to work . 
  for the dublin agreement and schengen to work , there needs to be a strong outer border . 
  either send economic support or manpower to the borders . 
  east european countries needs to lessen their religious influence on state decisions and get generally boost their education and boost their economy . 
  there needs to be a union defense force that everyone pays equal amount for . 
  not some gdp / % bullshit . 
  it 's a project that will take a while to complete but will pay off for everyone if they commit . 
  i do n't understand why people are so afraid of the future and the changes we can do . 
  but venezuela is a facist state ? 
  i do n't understand the attempted disconnect here . 
  i mean , nazi germany was a socialist and facist state . 
  they had a great run untill they went to war . 
  the nordic model does n't count as socialist because it 's successful and it hurts the narrative . 
  despite that , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/types_of_socialism , in this link , you 'll find among others , social democracy . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_democracy . 
  in the article , the nordic model is mentioned . 
  it has a mix of free market trade , yes . 
  in an aggressive capitalistic world you have to be able to function as an economy . 
  something venezuela was n't prepared for . 
  all the eggs in one oily basket . 
  when the saudis crashed the oil market , the only national income crashed . 
  what followed was a facist response . 
  what is often forgotten about venezuela is that the country has never ever been in a stable state . 
  never developed to a democracy . 
  and the rest of europe is cupping is nicely , 
  i do n't know what happened ... 
  i 'll start adopting 2 cats a day untill that pictues changes . 
  turkey is a big turist attraction among swedes but i think and hope we can call it quit . 
  it was already hard to get around as a european outside the tourist areas . 
  being manhunted for wearing shorts seems be the begining of the end for tourism in turkey . 
  i think goat cheese is only produced in the southern parts of europe . 
  i ca n't think any nordic country that has a major goat cheese production . 
  reindeer cheese and such would not supprise me the least . 
  mods . 
  do n't just delete the comments here . 
  you know this is very local news . 
  do n't start with an agenda now . 
  this is one of the few good places left on reddit . 
  i honestly feel like this is the way to go unless eu goes into full federal mode . 
  sweden is the odd child though . 
  once stockholm sinks into the sea , we might be on the level . 
  katze ass is love and trust . 
  you need to show your bum to your cat amd everyone you trust and love too !, 
  missmatched tooth paste flags everywhere . 
  i 'm curious . 
  do you want to be considered europeans ? 
  not members of eu , just geographicly ? 
  i 'd figure the tiny pink lady was too iconic to miss but it 's the queen of england this time . 
  i 've tried to say this a couple of times on this damn site but gotten massively downvoted because people get uncomfortable and ca n't argue . 
  i think because of the cold war propaganda , the definition of socialism is so blurry that it 's pretty much full blow communism the second you mention taxes or free healthcare . 
  [ the thing is , there 's lots of types of socialism . ], 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/types_of_socialism ) there 's one that 's [ sweden is based on ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_democracy ) that 's called social democracy . 
  saying that sweden is n't a real socialistic society is to bend the definition further . 
  by that logic , venezuela was n't either . 
  the main problem with the tried and failed communism/socialism states is that they all started with a millitary coup and ended up being an authoritarian shithole . 
  many of them had malicous outside influenses . 
  i also feel that corbyn gets taken out of context . 
  you could also praise venezuelas economic model and public services while being sceptical towards the rulers . 
  you could always set an example , 
  i felt like the joke about sweden reeked of t_d and / r/incels . 
  quite unoriginal to boot . 
  meh , when your only became successful because of the `` new world '' resources stealing from others , it 's kind of hard to take our eyes of you lots . 
  donald trump is pretty much the embodiment of american arogance . 
  damn , i miss obama . 
  those were some couple of years . 
  because it 's not ? 
  free healthcare and state owned infrastructure does n't make it socialist .

  we could also collect data on what eye color the perpetrators have as well , you fund all the new additions . 
  the moment ethnic crime data is reintroduced is the day sweden becomes great again . 
  good luck with brexit . 
  does n't look that bad either lol, 
  no im a syrian refugee who arrived tomorrow, 
  i meant autonomy . 
  serbia was independent for 9 years following the first serbian uprising in 1904 , reoccupied in 1913 . 
  then the second serbian uprising granted serbia autonomy once again and by 1835 they had their own constitution that called serbia a parliamentary principality . 
  the treaty of berlin was signed in 1878 , but the last ottoman soldier left serbia in 1868 and the process had already begun when serbia and the ottomans signed an agreement to end the second serbian uprising in 1917 . 
  serbia was independent , whether you like it or not . 
  what are you trying to prove with the serbo-turkish war anyway ? 
  it was not a war of independence lol it was in support of bosnian revolt . 
   milo\u0161 obrenovi\u0107 received the title of prince of serbia . 
  although the principality paid a yearly tax to the porte and had a garrison of turkish troops in belgrade until 1867 , it was , in most other matters , an independent state . 
  under the grandson of milo\u0161 's brother , milan , serbia gained formal independence in 1878 under the treaty of berlin . 
  i 'm taking racial crime data presented by the fbi as an example , how does that data help them in combating crime ? 
  yes , you need a group for it to be a resistance movement , not singular individuals who participate in foreign revolutions . 
  by 1830 serbia was already fully independent , and albanians were still ottoman pawns . 
  why ? 
  [ austrian empire ] ( http://prntscr.com/e9klti ), 
  when you do n't know what hyperbole is or that rinkeby is a bit bigger than just the town square where the film crew was yes, 
   it says albanians participated in revolutionary events i very much included it in my comment , i just wanted to highlight the part where it clearly says they killed them to prevent albanian resistance movements . 
  if they target potential resistance , there obviously ca n't be very big resistance , or they 'd deal with them instead . 
  but sure , keep ignoring what 's right in front of you . 
   therefore , something has changed in sweden . 
  there were reports in 1996 and 2005 . 
  just proves my point perfectly . 
  the data did n't do shit to help the state , it rather just created strife and therefore stopped being collected . 
   except that it did mention an existing resistance movement ( fighting on the side of greeks for their independence ) , and helping others do the same . 
  lol it says albanians participated in revolutionary events , but not that there were any albanian resistance movements at the time ( as they were the most loyal to the ottomans ) . 
  here 's the exact part since you are willfully ignorant :  * this massacre occurred in order to prevent albanian resistance movements *, 
   you might wonder , why do n't they collect it ? 
  because it does n't mean shit for the people who work with this , because those numbers wo n't make their work any easier or help them in any way , it will just be used by the far right to instigate . 
  what does the racial crime data collected by the fbi prove or do to assist the institutions ? 
  nothing , it just creates social dogma and results in racial profiling among other discrimination . 
   i mean how long it will take for mena nationals to form same part of population of sweden , like in current latvia where population is  30 % of foreign origin . 
  depends . 
  most people will integrate and later assimilate . 
  you realize all countries that exist today in europe did not just appear out of thin air , but were the homes for many peoples who at some point got assimilated , right ? 
  some wo n't , of course , but i 've never seen any complaints about the 600 ' 000 finns in northern sweden , the largest minority group in sweden . 
  people love to point their fingers at others , but an immigrant swede should receive the same punishment as ethnic swedes , as they 're supposed to become a part of this society rather than be pushed away . 
  blacks commit more violent crime than whites in america , but would you advocate different legal processes for the two ? 
  obviously not . 
   i mean how long it will take for mena nationals to form same part of population of sweden , like in current latvia where population is  30 % of foreign origin . 
  no idea , i feel like it wo n't happen any time soon . 
   the only major difference is that there are n't that much differences between latvians and russians on basic cultural , mentality level . 
  as there certainly are between ethnic swedes and mena immigrants . 
  it will be a riot . 
  or they conform , as very many have and will continue doing . 
   so you officially want to increase police presence in pressured areas ? 
  what happens when riots take place ? 
  you bring in the riot police to minimize damage . 
  you counter with equal force . 
  naturally areas that are much more crime-ridden than any average swedish neighborhood will receive more police presence and the safer ones wo n't require as much . 
  it 's just a natural response . 
  bury my head in the sand ? 
  i do n't see the need for ethnic data , crime is something you work on regardless of what the ethnicity of the criminal is . 
  the data does n't mean shit to the swedish state or the workers , it 's just there for breitbart , fox readers like yourself to instigate . 
  cute site too , basically breitbart # 2  sweden does not allow discussions of what they deem to be controversial issues . 
  that 's typical of the left , inappropriately called ` liberals ' . 
   name calling . 
  making up alternative facts to spread disinformation . 
  no , it 's one where the definition of the word , as in , the government has lost control and literally ca n't enforce law is not a fitting description for the area . 
  the fact of the matter is that those areas are more exposed than others , economically and criminally , and the solution according to police reports , is to ** increase police presence and mend ties with the population , increase co-operation ** rather than stop enforcing law . 
   what `` personal '' ? 
  lol , so basically swedish policemen decide on their own whether they want to patrol certain areas . 
  so no wonder why they do n't go there because of their own security . 
  i never said they choose where they go , just that people have their own opinions which does not make an area a no-go zone . 
   but if policemen under `` personal '' reasons do n't want to go there , how is law enforced ? 
  again , reading comprehension . 
   i mean ethnic , clanish mafia like structures running area under all sorts of criminal forms . 
  like being white swedish makes you target there for harassment or mugging . 
  i 've never been harassed or mugged for being white , nor have i ever encountered any of these outlandish law substitutions , but thanks for your concern . 
   i actually live in area which was most crime ridden in riga . 
  i have experienced how it has changed over 15 years , here the situation also was n't simple - different ethnic crime patterns , police corruption etc. 
  sometimes i wonder how swedes can be so incredibly naive . 
  honestly , i too , wonder . 
  i look forward to the day when our society is as evolved as the latvian society . 
  the world looks up to you . 
  no-go zones have a definition and those definitions are not met in the areas 50-odd areas , thus they are not no-go zones , no matter how badly you want to call them that . 
  [ this is what they call the areas and if decide to introduce words more fitting , you let them know ] ( http://prntscr.com/e9iz7q ), 
   no-go zones only cease to exist if you happen to not call them no-go zones . 
  it 's not a no-go zone if it does not fit the definition of the word , which no area in sweden does . 
  if you can name on that does fit the definition , let me know . 
  anecdotal . 
  swedish national council for crime prevention ( br\u00c5 ) does not collect that kind of data and thus there is no basis for such a statement . 
  you ca n't make an actual objective conclusion about it . 
  it 's called working there and knowing what the situation looks like , instead of basing their world view on fox and breitbart . 
   and the police did n't come because they did n't want to enter certain areas , that just never happened all of a sudden ? 
  police are there all the time , you just made that up . 
  it 's undisclosed why the police were not present at the time . 
   it 's obviously not as bad as detractors are going to portray the situation , but looking away and pretending that everything is ok and thinking that that attitude makes you superior to others is n't really helpful either . 
  pretending ? 
  if anyone were pretending , the police would n't release the report ( s ) that started the initial `` no-go zone '' rumor . 
  people care , and they know exactly how much to care , because they work there . 
  your average breitbart reader does not . 
  i have visited that exact place , that exact square , and i can tell you no one punched me . 
  i survived for more than 60 minutes there , can you believe it ? 
  beside that , how the fuck does that prove anything . 
  if i can get myself punched in dublin , does that make dublin a no-go zone ?

  they ca n't fly under the radar or use their size as a protection and they ca n't garner any sympathy by being native to an area . 
  a large chunk of europe already believes that islam is incompatible with western society . 
  the step from just believing that to also believing we need to take steps to remove them from western society is just a matter of how much of an issue people think islam actually is . 
  do n't confuse european kindness for a lack of claws . 
  it 's also enough time to get a sole majority . 
  terrorism is n't just making people scared and then politicians react to that , though . 
  every crime is going to scare people and an increase in a type of crime can cause political action . 
  the actual motive behind a crime has to be to spread terror in a population . 
  what we have right now is just a bunch of buildings burned down , there is as far as i know no reason to suspect that the perpetrators are connected to each other or that the crimes are . 
  would you call the people who burn cars every summer or so terrorists ? 
  i would n't feel comfortable calling them that just like i do n't feel comfortable calling this terrorism . 
  i also feel like there is a marked difference between `` fuck you , there ai n't gon na be no refugee housing here . 
  martha , fetch me my gasoline and my matches ! '', 
  and `` we , arsonists against refugees , have burned these buildings and will continue to burn buildings until we see the political change that we want . '', 
  in the previous scenario the motive was burning down the building and in the second one that was just a means to achieve political change . 
  eeeh , maybe ? 
  no group has left a manifesto or taken responsibility for this and it is very unlikely that it would be a group at all . 
  i think this has more in common with sabotaging construction equipment because you do n't agree with that skyscraper being built on what used to be a park . 
  terrorism implies a group purposefully targetting civilians in order to spread terror in order to get some sort of political change . 
  i ca n't get that from what is happening here . 
  i wish i lived in more enlightened times . 
  yeah , we could spend less on refugees here and double the unhcr budget at the same time , allowing time to help more people or give a better quality of life for the same ammount . 
  the ones who are for continuing this really have no leg to stand on at all . 
  i never used to feel personally affected by politics , it was more like sports for me , i might get pissed off or angry for a moment but then i went back to whatever i was doing and forgot about it . 
  this actually pisses me off the same way somebody kicking me in the nuts would piss me off , it makes me sick and it does n't go away when i do something else . 
  i do n't think it has anything to do with a desire to be decent , that would require people to sit down and think about it and then decide that they want to make a decision to be or to be seen as decent . 
  it 's more that this is just how it is . 
  there is a certain spectrum of things that are `` normal '' to believe and anything outside that is either strange and laughable or evil and must be fought . 
  give it ten years and i would n't be surprised to see that things have completely switched and and a new set of things will be true and `` obvious '' . 
  nobody will recall ever having thought differently , just that there were other dangerous or strange people that thought differently . 
  oh , i looked it up properly and i was wrong . 
  his sentence has actually been set but for 51 years . 
  this means that at the earliest he could get parole in 2016 , after 34 years in prison . 
  the life sentence in sweden actually does mean prison for life , or more accurately , prison for an indeterminate amount of time , minimum 18 years . 
  this sentence can later be converted into a normal prison sentence . 
  so say you was sentenced to life and now you 've sat 25 years . 
  you get your sentence converted to a 30 year sentence and now you have 5 years to go . 
  the longest set sentence in modern time has been served by leif axmy for a double homicide , 34 years . 
  there are several people serving life in prison who still do not have a set time , either because it is too recent or because their request has been rejected . 
  this guy might not spend his entire life in prison , but seeing as he is 35 currently he is going to be an old man when he gets out . 
  edit : leif axmyr actually had his sentence set to 51 years . 
  meaning he can at the earliest get parole in 2016 ( 2/3rds of sentence ) , this would have seen him spend 34 years in prison . 
  it was more like , in public discourse there was a very narrow spectrum of acceptable ideas and it was encouraged by the government ( indirectly ) and the media to ridicule , belittle or `` take action '' ( like firing or ostracizing ) against anyone who had ideas that fell outside of this spectrum . 
  people against todays immigration were never all painted as racists , it was more that they were failed individuals or `` angry young men '' searching for easy answers to hard questions and they were being led on by hitler in disguise . 
  i kind of got the impression that when it came to immigration you were encouraged to be `` dumb '' . 
  it has changed drastically in just a few months though . 
  things that would have been unthinkable just a while ago are par for the course now . 
  things are just so dire right now that it is completely impossible to keep up the previous status quo . 
  yes , if you are citizen of norway , iceland or any eu country or have a permanent residency permit and have lived in sweden for three consecutive years you can vote in local elections . 
  how do you mean ? 
  like for votes ? 
  do you mean a residency permit ? 
  i honestly do n't think that should be the immediate concern , it can take years to have your asylum application processed in sweden . 
  worst case scenario is 700 000 people arrive before the first ones have even been processed and then you have to house and feed and police all these people . 
  700 000 people is 7 % of sweden 's population pretty much all arriving at once . 
  i do n't see how we could house that amount people at an even remotely reasonable cost without tent cities . 
  these would have to be policed and the only institution that can do that is the military , police wo n't cut it . 
  and since a lot of these would not be granted asylum you have a situation with thousands of angry young men all in one place that are set to be deported . 
  recipe for humanitarian disaster if you ask me . 
  true , but not everybody can do this . 
  not everybody even has anything to really contribute with . 
  the most important tool for change the average person has is still the vote . 
  sd is the most popular party in the country right now ( i do n't want to say biggest until polls are actually confirmed by elections ) . 
  at this rate they could well be the largest block by themselves come next election . 
  shit , if things continue this way i would n't rule out them getting a majority , 700k new people in a year is a hard pill to swallow . 
  what else do you want people to do , overthrow the government ? 
  we should build armies and ships until russia is officially threatened , then we send a diplomat to improve relations and when relations are over 190 we offer vassalisation so we can diplo annex them ten years later . 
  after we feed them china , of course . 
  eh , vietnam and japan are smaller than several european countries . 
  those students are wrong then . 
  there is no shortage of unskilled laborers , swedish or otherwise . 
  given the option even them spoilt swedes would rather be a cleaner than live on welfare . 
  if they have better options they are probably going to pursue those , but that is true for everybody . 
  even low income earners in sweden earn a relatively high wage compared to what they could make . 
  you will be able to survive on any non shady full time job . 
  your picture of sweden as a place where swedes are all doctors and immigrants work for a pittance is wrong . 
  the students that told you this are idiots ignorant of how their own country works or they are pushing some political point . 
  my guess is they might have `` copy/pasted '' their ideas from the american left . 
  sometimes you see that with the left here , they 've just completely lifted a phrase or argument from the american debate that makes no sense in our context . 
  where did you get this ? 
  sweden is not the uae . 
  the whole `` they do jobs we do n't want to '' is just as bullshit as `` we need them for pensions '' . 
  at least in europe . 
  by more solid charges i mean , why not make up rape charges that would have an easier time sticking and would be more severe ? 
  surely if the us can convince the leadership of two sovereign countries to commit treason then it should be able to convince a woman to seduce assange and let the cia beat her up a little . 
  why not go with `` assange took a woman home and when she said no he beat her half to death '' rather than `` assange had sex with a woman when she was sleeping '' ? 
  even if he is convicted there would be many people going `` eh , that ai n't so bad '' . 
  do you realize that you are arguing against your own position ? 
  you beg a good question , if this was a conspiracy then why not fabricate more solid charges ? 
  this seems to be a theme with conspiracy theories , the shadowy group that controls everything is both omniscient but also extremely incompetent . 
  the only one of these i have heard of is sambo , which is common . 
  i could see kombo being used by particular types of girls but i 've never heard it . 
  mambo i do n't think anybody would use as it would have weird sexual connotations . 
  for roomates we just say roomate but in swedish , but roomates are not that common herr . 
  something i will never understand about you guys is this , if being a virgin is such an issue for you then why not just lie ? 
  you ca n't proove irregularities in the swedish court system by referencing things that happened in greece or the us . 
  who exactly would take this decision ? 
  who do you believe has the power to order a court to make a specific ruling ? 
  any healthcare professional be that a physician , nurse , pharmacist , whatever , that would aid in the suicide of a physically healthy person is a disgrace to their field and to humanity in general . 
  assisted suicide should be about allowing people to escape a situation that does not allow for basic human dignity and from which there is no recovering , not about projecting this stupid romantisation of suicide on the healthcare sector .

  greece had a debt of 98 % in 1993 . 
  but belgium had a debt of 125 % in 1993 . 
  that 's what i wanted to say . 
  we did n't end up in a situation like greece because we have ( had ) a huge private surplus . 
  greece does n't . 
  ok , that just means that you are not taking care of your finances either . 
  rather reckless if you ask me in these times . 
  there are a lot of reasons you are not where greece is , for example you have more industy , you are not as corrupt , you do n't have the same rampant tax evasion etc. 
  that is also in now way an argument for me to hand over more money we have been doing that every day since we joined . 
  and guess what - when we increased our retirement age , they decreased . 
  we reformed our labour market , they did n't etc. 
  why are they not changing then ? 
   but i think we could give them some space and some breath to do this . 
  what , apart from paying their salaries etc ? 
  how much breath do you need ? 
  whos money are you planning on investing ? 
  you do know that greece have n't really implemented anything , italy has n't changed any of it labour laws , they re - elected berlosconi etc. 
  you are saying that we should * keep * giving them money , without proof . 
  that is what we have been doing forever , and it has not worked - they have lived off that money . 
  enough !, 
  also , you do understand that `` the breeding space '' you are referring to is money that comes from other peoples tax payers ? 
  it is easy to hand over other peoples money . 
  if you are so sure , why does n't belgium borrow a lot of money , hand it over to the greeks ( you seem to say that is no risk ... . ) . 
  we would rather wait , but please , you go ahead . 
  '  well , i think this only really applies to greece and maybe protugal . 
  italy is n't in that much trouble today . 
  spain had a balanced budget before the crisis . 
  it were their banks that fucked it up . 
  same goes for ireland . 
  no , it 's not just about the banks , although i wish it was . 
  yes , the immidiate crises , but that is not what brought greece to it 's knees , or southern italys corruption . 
  italy has had a low growth for years , refused to deal with rigid bureacracy , rigid labour laws etc. 
   i believe we 'll be getting on a very , very dangerous path then . 
  this will cause the ez to collapse . 
  once the possibility of leaving the ez is certainly there . 
  so , if you ca n't handle the heat - get out . 
  or , you could see it as if you refuse to reform , lie , cheat and have no industry , you should n't be there to begin with . 
  cut the dead weight . 
  yes , i know that maybe other countries will fall , but perhaps they need to fall then . 
  you keep on asking money for your pet project , which was ill though off to begin with ( fincancial integration without political ) . 
   i fear the ez is too much intertwined with the eu to keep the eu safe after its fall . 
  what , so . 
  so you mean that we are not going to have a free custom union if the ez falls ? 
  i ca n't work in the netherlands any more ? 
  of course the eu is there , just set back a bit , think about it as eu back in 98 or something . 
  hardly the end of the world , maybe that will teach the politicans some lessons . 
   of course it 's not the fault of the lenders now , but they 're not free from blame either that is not what you are hearing from a lot of the countries in the debt crises . 
  also , while they are not guilt free ( the lenders ) , these countries essentially created this situation for themselves ( compare with the baltics , with finland , with sweden , the different crises over there , also created by the countries themselves , and solved by themselves ) . 
  all of a sudden we should come running with money so that you ill though through pet project wo n't fall , so that countries do n't have to change . 
  let it fall . 
  we are all grown ups - why not face the consequenses of once actions . 
  if it 's that bad , maybe it has to fall , you can start again in 10-20 years time if you like . 
   you need to remember why the ez was formed . 
  it was because of mass speculation against national currencies , in particular the italian and the french currency . 
  no , that is not why the ez was formed . 
  first , it was greece who had that debt in 1993 , not belgium . 
  sorry , i meant to write that . 
   also sweden made some great progress thanks to the open european market . 
  other countries , some of them in southern europe benefited as well . 
  i am not saying everything is/was bad , but while we paid off debt , reformed labour market ( we still need to do a lot more btw ) , balanced budgets etc , other countries * choose * not to . 
  so , now we have to pay even more since they have behaved ( financially ) bad.that is unfair and disloyal of those countries refusing to change . 
  honestly , when talking about being `` loyal '' to other countries , i do n't think they are being very loyal towards the eu or the eurozone . 
  it 's not loyal to * always * receive money . 
  it 's not loyal to live on other people 's money , it 's not loyal to refuse to reform . 
  perhaps they need this to wake up . 
   demanding from the greek that they get their budget under control with a bond yield of 17 % is just too harsh . 
  that 's impossible for greece . 
  personally , i think greece should exit the ez . 
   but it 's also important to keep the eu alive . 
  the eu is alive , maybe the ez is not . 
  if the ez ca n't handle the pressure , then maybe it should fall . 
  i am not big on keeping government , banks , states going forever with the help of aid . 
  sure , sometimes it can be beneficial with some extra help , but southern europe have received extra money since the eu was formed - maybe this is what the eu needs to see that you just ca n't transfer money endlessly . 
  sure it will hurt a lot , but it will be better in the long run . 
  if you are not ready for it , stop entering fiscal unions . 
  ca n't stop being corrupt - well , then you are not getting any more money . 
  we are putting band aids on what essentially needs surgery - that has to stop one way or another , and better sooner than later . 
   it 's the private debt that made it so hard for greece . 
  that private debt accumulated because of the eurozone . 
  no one forced them to borrow money , and as i said , 98 % ( !!! ), 
  also , what has made it hard for greece is the rampant corruption , the tax evasion , the lack of industry etc. ... 
   lets try to be pragmatic , what kind of non economic benefit are you going to have to sacrifice if europe go down i do n't think wwiii is starting which seems to be what you are implying . 
  i think one has to take responsibilty for ones choices , both as a person , and as a country . 
  i do n't think a lot of countries ( and persons ) are doing that though.i think in the long run it benefits everybody . 
  we ( sweden ) had a financial crises in the 90 's and i can really say that it was good that we had it , good that we had to fix it ourselves as well . 
  that crises paved the way for a common fear among people and politicians alike for inflation/to much debt / borrowing/overspending and has led to the fact that nowdays * none * of the big parties dare not to balance a budget . 
  we have a more independent national bank than ecb and we 've been paying off debts like there 's no tomorrow , which in the long run has helped us . 
  it honestly does n't strike me as many countries of the ez have that sense of responsibility of the crises yet , it is , after all , they who have created it ( just like sweden created our own crise ) . 
  i mean , heck , we are talking about retiring at 70 now , and people in other countries are demonstrating because they are at 65 ? 
  seriously , for the pensions to work , one * has * to work longer . 
  that is just one example of how i think the swedish mindset was positively changed by the crises , and i really do n't see why that ca n't happen in other countries . 
  it will not happen though , as long as one keeps on throwing good money after bad , nor will it happen if one alway blame other people . 
  besides , you have n't answered how loyal/solidaric it is to live on other peoples money . 
  why should just we be loyal with our wallets , why not them ? 
  i 'd rather be loyal in that sense that i know it 's going to hurt me to if they fall , but seriously , they might need it to fix themselves . 
  no one else can fix me , neither as a person or country , but i have to want it and be prepared to do it . 
  i do n't think a lot of countries in the ez are . 
  still , we do n't want to give more , and you have no right to force us , you did say you wanted the eu to hand over money to the eurozone . 
   of course the money should come with conditions.of course the money should come with conditions . 
  the money has * always * come with conditions , but that has never ever stopped anything .

  american cultural influence could be seen as great in some ways and degenerate in other ways . 
  american economical influence might be seen as great in some ways and inequal in other ways . 
  it 's kind of like those blm controversies : when you say `` america is great '' it 's understood that you mean `` for some '' , because it 's certainly not great over-all . 
  he hardly predicted them . 
  [ i think the first one was like in 2013 in husby . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_stockholm_riots ), 
  i like your version , where trump can [ predict the future ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qd8mo4n.png ) , but does n't know the difference between past and future tense . 
  he probably read a grammar book and thought everything he says is ` perfect ' . 
  i 'm not the one to google ` anders borg erect penis ' but please , be my guest . 
  i did n't ask him . 
  strong is probably more accurate than great . 
  trump did n't strike me as the hipster kind of guy until now . 
  yeah , pretty much that . 
  when were they great ? 
  i wonder how well this would float in the swedish pride parade this weekend . 
  the main news story this week was that former financial minister anders borg was at a party where he showed his penis , called women sluts and grabbed other men by the crotch . 
  socks in sandals is all about being practical and sandals are n't practical when hiking . 
  only fake germans would do that . 
  op 's title is slightly misleading . 
  this does n't seem to be a top list , but rather a `` best to worst '' list . 
  how many countries do we count the european union as ? 
  that 's iran , not italy . 
  either online or you call `` skatteverket '' ( the government agency that handles tax ) and ask them . 
  most websites only gives full social security number to registered ( paying ? ), 
  users so if you want that for you probably need to call skatteverket . 
  not sure how easy it is to get declined this information . 
  they always asked me who i was and why i wanted the information ( it was through work ) but i never had to vertify anything so basically anybody could do it . 
  yeah , most europeans i 've talked to think it 's fucked up but that 's how it works here . 
  i have a feeling that the journalist is n't swedish and was n't aware of how things work here ( or he was just clickbaiting ) . 
  edit : i should clarify that the government does n't stalk you to find your adress . 
  you register your living adress yourself but it 's up to you if you actually live there . 
  this adress has some importance ( e.g some items will only be sent to your registered living adress regardless of what you request ) . 
  so it 's assumed that nearly all citizens of sweden are in at least one of these groups ? 
  * a police register * the air force * an operator in the military 's most secret units * in a witness relocation program * drives a government and military vehicle to be honest it 's hard to estimate how large these groups are combined without more information . 
  i 'm curious on what the `` personal details of ** nearly all citizens ** '' includes . 
  was it the photos ? 
  name and home adress is public information in sweden . 
  if you want to avoid awkward half translations like this article just say 70,000 sek . 
  it 's the international standard code for our currency . 
   \u00c5gren was also fined half a month 's pay ( 70,000 swedish krona which equals to $ 8,500 ), 
  many commuter trains in stockholm are named by kindergarten kids . 
  they clearly needed to step up the game this time . 
  i read this on donald 's twitter . 
  i was probably unclear . 
  edited my comment . 
  i do n't think it 's hypocritical of the french for criticizing the death penalty despite utilizing it in an important historic event for them , and i do n't think they need to deny the french revolution because they changed their stance on capital punishment . 
  what i think is hypocritical is to make fun of what i described above while living in another country that also used capital punishment back in the days , as if that 's any different . 
  did there exist any countries that did n't have death penalty back then ? 
  that would explain the lacks of comments ; nobody wants to sound like a hypocrite . 
   * edit : i do n't think it 's hypocritical of the french for criticizing the death penalty despite utilizing it in an important historic event for them , and i do n't think they need to deny the french revolution because they changed their stance on capital punishment . 
  *  * what i think is hypocritical is to make fun of what i described above while living in another country that also used capital punishment back in the days , as if that 's any different . 
  if you use genocide memorial days to advocate for your conspiracy theories you 're just being disrespectful . 
  i do n't know how far we should take `` there is a time and place for everything '' but this is definitely not that time and place . 
  and it would stop just about as many innocent people from attending . 
  so the law saw one parent as adopt parent and the other as a step parent ? 
  or not at all ? 
  but what 's your opinion on a woman marrying a car and two cars marrying each other ? 
  and one could assume that adoption can be pretty important for couples who ca n't have their own biological children . 
  as a swede i was really surprised when my dad had to pay a fee for using a german atm . 
  also i wonder how population density plays into these statistics . 
  sweden and germany is roughly the same size but germany has like 8 times the population ( and according to this : 3 times the atm 's per capita ) . 
  yeah , according to [ this ] ( https://vapenfakta.se/forskning-och-statistik/ ) there are 619,000 gun owners in sweden and they own a total of 1,8 million weapons or weapon parts ( i 'm not entirely sure what ` weapon parts ' does and does not include ) . 
  * 6 % of the population owns one or more guns ( rounding the population to 10 millions ) . 
  * 3 guns on average per gun owner . 
  * 190,000 of the 619,000 gun owners ( 30 % ) practice or compete in shooting as a sport . 
  * 300,000 people hunts every season ( 48 % of the number of gun owners ) . 
  it specifically says that different people hunt each season so the total number of hunters ( who hunts less than once per year ) might be more than 300,000 . 
  twelve points for religion . 
  so are those lakes still frozen ? 
  -6 degrees celsius . 
  the recovery starts when you turn the trend around . 
  no , the purpose is to tell him he misunderstood a basic concept . 
  sorry , what ? 
  i just explained how graphs works . 
  you seem to confuse absolute and relative terms . 
  if a car is going full speed reverse and you want to recover back to normal speed forward , stopping the car to 0 is still part of the progress called recovery . 
  that despite the fact that at any one moment you will always measure a negative speed ( or zero movement ) and you have n't started moving in the right direction . 
  this was 35 % of my full attempt . 
  not sure if you 're giving the best analogies seeing as any financial crisis would mean death . 
  but sure , while your current trajectory might still be heading downwards , it is still posible to have a positive trend . 
  would you rather * have 2 billion dollars and lose 1 billion dollars per second ? 
  * have 2 billion dollars in debt and earn 1 billion dollar per second ? 
  it 's called a slow recovery because greece changed the trend from `` losing billions of dollars per second '' to `` losing nothing per second '' and now that they plugged the hole they need to figure out how to pump the water out of the boat . 
  that 's why it 's called slow recovery . 
  if you go from -5 % per year to -2 % per year and then finally to + -0 % per year that 's still a positive trend . 
  interesting . 
  so is gun rights special or is it more about infringing on the freedom of individuals ? 
  could it have been any other random freedom that obama infringed on ? 
  did obama even do much anti-gun ? 
  i heard a lot about it but nothing concrete . 
  so it 's really that simple ? 
  conservative , good . 
  liberal , bad , lynch . 
  so when you asses how much a president aided enemies , do you have a more elaborate criteria than if the president is republican/democrat ? 
  do you for example assume that the current trump failures are amplified by 12 or does he get a 90 month handicap simply because he is only half a year into his first term ? 
  man you must really hate trump then . 
  something does n't add up here . 
  what makes you want to lynch the political opposition then ? 
  you want to lynch your political opposition . 
  what differs you from fascists ?

  idiot . 
  b ) you are on an / r/europe board , most people here could lecture you in ways you have no clue about . 
  i think in soviet alone , 20 million died , in the wwii . 
  c ) give me a reason why * you * are morally superior and thus the only one allowed to talk about suffering . 
  it is sickening , a person from the richest , most powerful country in the world who invades countries and kills millions because it is fun , talk about * suffering * and thinks , due to this enormous suffering , that he is the only one allowed to talk about it . 
  are n't you going to lecture us about how hard it is living under dictatorship too , because your great uncle spent a month in ddr ? 
   go ahead kick back and complain about the u.s. in your tiny nordic country that has grown rich profiting from the liberal international order that the u.s. and our allies have built and maintained with money and lives , but do n't pretend like the word would be a better place had the u.s. been absent from the international scene these past 70 years . 
  it would n't be . 
  the fun thing is that you do not even understand that you are slowly , but surely , digging your own grave . 
  i have tried to explain to you that your military spending are far to big , and you answer that you need them to defend yourself against a country that does n't even exist . 
  if it was n't so sad i would laugh . 
  however , things are going down for you . 
  not now , but slowly . 
  instead of spending on education , you make sure you cut resourses from schools , from environment , from food stamps , just to make sure your spend more than the next 30 countries put together ( it says a lot about you that you think this sum is reasonable , and you justify it by defending yourself against the soviet union ... still ) . 
  no , you have no risk of getting invaded , and you are slowly , but surely loosing your international ground and standing . 
  iraq , but also things that you could n't even go to trade conferences because you are shutting down your own government . 
  but sure , keep it up . 
  what is the next country you are going to invade and then complain `` how much you 've suffered '' after killing poor defenceless peasants at a ration 1000 to 1 ( but your soldier is a hero , dying in a fight with a poor farmer ... ) . 
  you are truly a sad and narcisstic person . 
   let me explain it this way : the way the electoral system is set up creates a situation where there can only be two major parties . 
  this causes both parties to adopt essentially identical centrist political platforms with minor differences between them . 
  couple this with the lobbied interests who want to keep the status quo ( and who pay the politicians to vote their way ) , and you have politicians who run for office who disagree on very little of substance . 
  anyone who deviates far from that , for the most part , is marginalized and made a pariah . 
  third parties have zero power to get elected in anything of substance . 
  so , how have you functioned as a country before . 
  you have had this since the 18th century , what has changed now ? 
  also , if it is that bad , i supppose the call for change will grow until somethings happen . 
  i do understand that some things are difficult to change , all countries have that but other countries with a two party system manage changes , i do not see why the us could n't . 
  also , at least compared to us you have politicians who disagree more . 
  when i look at some of your more , ahem , let us call them colourful tea party members who obviously got elected and compare them to some pot smoking thing from seattle - there is a huge difference . 
   cutting military adventurism is difficult because anyone who advocates it is painted as someone who wants america to be invaded ( a ridiculous notion , but it does work to get people to the polls ) , and there are lots of people and companies whose livelihoods are tied to it , and they wo n't willingly let it go . 
  it might be difficult , but not impossible . 
  however , it is still a democratic choice the americans * could * make , but they choose not to . 
  so , you keep your military spendings because you want to . 
  you honestly have no clue , do you . 
  you are still using that , as an excuse , for your * current * military spending which is more * than the next 30 countries put together * . 
  you do not even seem to grasp the simple fact that it is way to much and you would hardly be invaded if you cut it with one third , tomorrow . 
  also , you are thinking and acting like you are some defender of freedom . 
  maybe 70 years ago , but your behaviour since , in the middle east , vietnam and elsewhere has proven that you do not care one tiny bit about ideals like democracy and freedom , just about your interests , that is all . 
  so , stop claiming ideals no one in the world believes you champions one tiny bit ( do you want me to give you examples of working against those ideals , every single fucking day ) and just come out and say `` we want to rule the world and for that we need to invade a few countries every now and then and we need a huge military complex '' . 
  no one , belives you champion freedom . 
  for god 's sake , at least read what the other americans in this thread states , they are being far more honest than you are . 
   you might have grown up in a soviet utopia in sweden without the u.s. guaranteeing your security . 
  sigh , you are one of those americans . 
  good night . 
   fighting two wars tends to get a bit expensive , which is why spending has gone up . 
  it 's set for for big cuts as we wind down operations in afghanistan and iraq . 
  anyway , that is what i said , that you should cut down on your military spending . 
  if you are doing it - why are we arguing ( apart from the fact that i do not believe that you will , you need wars to keep your military complex alive ) . 
   asian countries are quarreling over territorial claims in their seas . 
  check out a newspaper and read about it . 
  the entire point of our presence their is prevent war from breaking out , not to go to war . 
  seriously , i know that they quarrell , but a ) that does n't mean you have to be there because half of the time you just make things worse , * and * it still does n't justify the military spendings you currently have . 
   the u.s. has only been hegemon since the early 90 's , and thus only in a position to guarantee global balance of power since the early 90 's . 
  the u.s. , along with our significant allies like britain and france , rebuilt the international system we all live in after ww2 , and it has brought a period of unprecedented peace to the west . 
  the u.s. is responsible for maintaining that system , and that requires us to spend a significant portion of our budget on security . 
  jesus , are you trolling me ? 
  like you helped with vietnam ? 
  chile ? 
  iraq ? 
  and that is * still * not good enough reason for your spendings . 
  if the 90 's were good enough - go back to the spendings you did then . 
  your spendings have increased exponentially since ( almost obviously ) . 
   we ca n't in any really meaningful way . 
  we have treaties to maintain , sea lanes to protect , etc. 
  plus allies end up losing their shit - like saudi arabia and other gulf countries right now - if we do anything to pull back you managed to do that just fine before 2001 actually . 
  your spending has increased almost exponentially since . 
  the us military budget is as big as * the next 30 countries on the list put together * . 
  why not just make it as big as the next 15 countries put together . 
  do you think china is about to attack ? 
   used responsibly the us military can keep the peace by maintaining the balance of power between countries . 
  obviously iraq was gross misuse of that power , but if the u.s. was n't so involved with what 's going on in asia right now it could turn into an asian ww1 really fast . 
  when have you ever used it responsible ? 
  which decade ? 
  and , why were you less responsible in the 80 's and 90 's , when your defense budget was a lot smaller ? 
  and frankly , why on earth is asia going to war , and have n't you learned not to go to war in asia ? 
  how bad can it be ? 
  we bring ikea , pop music , meat balls and ombudsm\u00e4n . 
  just surrender ... ... 
  you said yes , as a country , united , republicans and democrats to the war on terror . 
  i think you could choose to stop it . 
  you have always had republicans and democrats and the same constitution and still managed to say no to war and and cut down your military complex . 
  what has changed ? 
  and , other countries with two party systems manage to change . 
  so , why not the us and why not now ? 
  you can still do it , i still do n't see any scientific reasons why not . 
  the only reason i see is that not enough vote against stuff , but that is the choice of the people in the us . 
  i am sure the person you describe exists btw . 
  go for it . 
  a ) i think people might believe that you think swedes are fucked in the head . 
  i do not mean that you think that , i just think your english might be a tad confusing . 
  b ) you linked to a russian article without explanation or translation . 
  but you forget that almost every single congressman/senator voted for the iraq war . 
  that was the people 's choice !, 
  you wanted that war . 
  do you want me to link to polls when i get back ? 
  you guys wanted that war , more than anything . 
  you forget that you have voted to increase the military budget every year . 
  you forget that the american people could punish obama , or anyone else who goes to war behind their back , or a congressman who supports it by electing someone else . 
  debt ceiling default and shutdown - well , do n't go republican then ?

  where do you see the word `` muslim '' ? 
  please stop with this shit , it 's getting ridiculous . 
  that 's your opinion . 
  i do n't know anyone who 's changing their votes . 
   there are very few countries in western europe alone with a higher gdp-per-capita , median income & average income , especially in ppp . 
  america is 14th in the world , ppp . 
  switzerland , luxembourg , ireland , norway , san marino are the european ones . 
  they are all except san marino above you in nominal as well . 
  gross per-capita income ( ppp ) has sweden , denmark , finland , norway and luxembourg ranking higher than you . 
  luxembourg beats you in average wave as well . 
   the eu as a whole , which is the only true comparison to america is economic size , population & territory , does n't even rank in the same league . 
  am i supposed to marvel at this ? 
  this has everything to do with your size and military capabilities , eliminating anyone who disagrees with you ( hello cold war ) and as i said before , putting your interests over anything else . 
  say hello to saudi arabia from me . 
   and you 're right , a big shift did happen in wwi . 
  it was the first time america seriously entered european politics from a strong , if not dominant , position , by basically being one of , if not the main factor in the war 's end , with us having a big seat at the table for versailles ' negotiation , even if it ended up being much harsher than we wanted . 
  we were also the leading proponent for the league of nations , even as congress rejected america 's entry into it despite wilson  but once again , the treaty of versailles is mostly european politics & history , so i can forgive your ignorance on it . 
   first of all , what does that even mean ? 
  you think the war would still be raging today if it were n't for the us ? 
  it never fails to amaze me how americans think they 're the center of the world . 
  you were not as big of a player in ww1 as you obviously think . 
  secondly , ignorance on what ? 
  are you trying to tell me the versailles treaty was written in english because of america ? 
  also , [ big fan of wilson ] ( http://thefederalistpapers.org/us/top-10-most-racist-quotes-from-progressive-hero-woodrow-wilson ), 
   wtf are you talking about ? 
  it was the eu countries which pushed us into libya & france was the one who was pissed at obama for not bombing assad . 
  lol libya was terrible , but comparing that to , say , iraq , is ridiculous . 
   which is my point . 
  you enjoy all the benfitts of nato without any of the responsibilities or commitments . 
  and are we wrong for asking for 2 % ? 
  shit , with friends like your country it should be a given , no something for you to mock . 
  that 's not our fault , they like us it seems . 
  it 's not like it was some long-term plan . 
  there 's like 19 countries that spend 2 % or more on defence , three of which are in eu . 
  trust me , we do n't need to be more like those countries nor do we need to increase spending when we 're already huge in comparison to the rest of the world . 
   of course not , because we 've already established above that you 're incapable of recongnizing your own mistakes , with a better understanding of american politics & history than europe 's . 
  lulz  kinda weird you mentioned hungary , but not greece , italy & spain . 
  lol what about them ? 
  what 's 16k refugees to 40 ' 000 ' 000 spaniards for example ? 
  eu and the countries come to agreements , why are you making it sound like they 're forced ? 
   oh , did you learn english to go to indian universities & watch south african movies ? 
  lol to get a job in the jamaican silicon valley ? 
  invest in new zealand 's wall street ? 
  america is rich because america is big . 
  there 's countries in europe with higher gdp/capita . 
  there 's nothing impressive about being 320 million people . 
  same with your `` language spreading '' . 
   you 're so fucking smug , and once again , ignorant of your own region 's history , you ca n't even admit the effect american hegemony has had on spreading the english language . 
  lol the versailles treaty was written in english as well as french . 
  the switch happened quite a bit earlier than ww2 . 
   and i do n't deny responbility or causing a fuckton of our mistakes . 
  but can you do the same ? 
  tell me , are you able to list off the numerous fuck-ups we made in the 50s , 60s & 70s , but at the same time do n't talk about , or worse , do n't know about , the countless european fuck-ups from the same time period when it comes to the era of de-colonization & the developing world , especially in regards to the middle east & africa ? 
  sure , but that happened and now the eu has not done anything remotely close to it since . 
  america has been all over the rest of the world since then . 
  europe notes american actions and makes sure not to repeat them , yet america does n't do the same . 
   as the saying goes , sweden will fight until the last finn . 
  and once again , you 're not in nato dude . 
  lol you just enjoy being surrounded by it & tied to them through the eu , with none of the responsibilities or obligations that come with it . 
  we are not literally in nato , but we are * in * nato . 
  why does that bother you ? 
  if we were , you 'd be crying over us not spending 2 % and the list goes on . 
  point is that we do n't border russia , we do n't need to be a walking military . 
  i like how you make it out to be our fault , we simply chose not to join . 
  if our allies see us worthy of interference in case of an invasion , how are we to blame ? 
  naturally we have ties with our allies . 
   oh , you do n't ? 
  than why do n't you push to offer southern europe fiscal transfers & a debt haircut ? 
  instead of , you know , imposing austerity on them while the rest of northern europe , your largest trading partners iirc , use a artificially overvalued currency to outcompete them . 
  that 's one hell of an argument lol . 
  i wo n't even start . 
   no , you just encourage them to come to europe & paint a pretty pocture while every other country between you & the med are actually the ones who have to deal with the fallout . 
  people temporarily staying these countries is somehow a massive burden on them ? 
  we have every right to our own immigration policies . 
  countries like hungary will only receive 200 fucking refugees in the next two years . 
  sweden accepted 30,000 asylum requests last year , yet there are over 2,7 million refugees in turkey alone . 
  please elaborate ? 
   yeah , that 's why & when so many swedes began speaking english , the british empire which was on it 's deathbed in wwii , not american hegemony which has reigned supreme over the western world since then & has more direct/overt influence on continental europe than britain probably ever did . 
  remember when great britain colonized half of the world and used english as a lingua franca ? 
  please explain how america made 12 % of india learn english . 
  i mean you literally speak english because of them , so there 's that . 
   yeah , you 'll increase the use of military force while reducing collateral damage with power projection & intelligence gathering not even in the same league as the united states . 
  lol you 're a fucking genius . 
  you do n't need a fraction of the power projection the us has . 
  america has 2.1 million personnel , of which < 10 ' 000 are in afghanistan . 
  intelligence gathering never has been the issues , but rather the us putting their interests above anything else , even the lives of civilians . 
   but leave it to a swede to act like this . 
  you rely on finland & america to futhur your military interests , germany & the eu to futhur your economic interests , southern europe & turkey to handle the worst parts of the refugee crisis which you continously encourage , but at the same time wan na get on a superiority shtick about how you 're a trailblazer who others should look to as a leader , even when as a society you 're learning english as fast as you can & gobbling down american pop culture like the shit is going out of style . 
  cringing hard right now 1 . 
  we do n't need to be a walking military like the united states . 
  and no , no one forced you , you 're the one who willingly takes that position , so like right now , you can be bombing in 5 countries and be militarily active , training troops etc in 130 countries . 
  not to even mention all the wars and your atrocities which you 're not even admitting or taking responsibility for . 
  as for finland , they have conscription and it 's not because of sweden , but rather because they border russia and are n't members of nato . 
  it 's kind of funny you 're talking about finland however , since they spend 1,3 % of their gdp while sweden spends 1,1 % . 
  massive difference , huh . 
  germany & eu to further economic interests ? 
  sweden has a strong economy , it 's called a socio-economic organization , for co-operation . 
  we do n't * need * anyone , neither does anyone else in the eu , but it 's beneficial for everyone . 
  southern europe & turkey to handle the refugee crisis ? 
  refugees are simply passing by southern europe .

  however everyone and their brother knows what the end game is : the wrecked corporate sector in southern europe , especially italy . 
  italy 's npa are very high and while their banking sector get all the headlines , their corporate sector is in a semi-zombie state as well . 
  since draghi himself is italian , it 's inevitable that this will be used against him when the ecb will pull the trigger . 
  so , for now , mostly german corporations that frankly do n't need it . 
  this of course also gives german corporations far better debt terms than they should otherwise have , which is a risk in of itself , but thats the game that has to be played to get the germans onboard for what is essentially a monetary bailout of southern europe 's corporate sector . 
  the irony of this massive `` hunt for yield '' in the bond markets is that nations who should * not * have this privilege are also seeing their bond rates go down . 
  for instance , poland 's economic populism by reversing the hiking of the pension retirement age , the disastrious 500 + programme etc is nevertheless seeing its bond yields go down . 
  india 's economic management is better , but they are a developing country , yet they still see this . 
  on top of all of that , the ecb is buying more and more eurozone debt and now even corporate bonds . 
  i get that op wants to make this a nationalistic `` see , germany good ! '', 
  feel-good story , but this is * not * a good story . 
  when debt becomes increasingly less costly all around the world , the appetite for careless risk and massive debt binges increases . 
  not every country is as fiscally disciplined as germany and reduce their debt even in good times . 
  this is a dangerous thing for the world , because markets tend to discipline bad fiscal behaviour but this mechanism is now increasingly out of order . 
  fair enough . 
  i 'm not following austrian politics very closely , to put it mildly , but i was under the impression that they were at around 15-20 % for most of the last decade or so . 
  wikipedia more or less confirms that . 
  good points . 
  i still think vdb is the likely winner for the reason you mentioned . 
  and at any rate , the president is largely ceremonial anyway . 
  a bigger shock is the sky-high support for fp\u00d6 in the poll . 
   doch [ til ] ( http://german.about.com/library/weekly/aa010806b.htm ) . 
  how is kern 's rapproachment with hungary going with the social democratic base ? 
  does he face any blowback of any kind ? 
  what 's the debate like in austria on that issue . 
  in sweden , the social democrats faced a brutal internal attack for their newly established asylum rules for instance . 
  there 's also the split between the old white working class base and the newly immigrant groups in metropolitan areas , just like in the uk with labour . 
  how is that dynamic , if at all , playing out in austria ? 
  thanks for the insight , just a follow-up , is n't kern doing more than his predecessor on immigration ? 
  i mean he has , for instance , made a point to repair relations with hungary and to co-operate closer with them . 
  just last year , hungary was denounced by faymann as reminding him of nazis , so is n't that a 180 ? 
  what i 'm saying is : given that kern has moved to this position , do you think it could blunt hofer any way at all ? 
  or do people simply do not trust the mainstream parties anymore on this issue ? 
   leaving the eu has been successful so far [ k ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-economy-pmi-idukkcn1020t2 ), 
  the burgers are running nato , not us . 
  and the burgers want the turks to stay . 
  i want a pan-european federal army . 
  i only want europe to be in charge of european defence . 
  however , as long as france/germany/uk are waffling on baltic and eastern european security , that will be a pipe dream , even with the recent movements and noises . 
  interesting he 's now being described as `` right-wing '' . 
  he was regularly described as far-right as recently as this year . 
  also , i have to say i am surprised by this . 
  given the post-brexit turbulence , i 'd have thought his euroskeptic stance would have hurt him . 
  perhaps other issues , like the terrorism in france and germany , have overtaken those concerns because he 's seen as more tough on immigration . 
  it 'd be great if an austrian redditor could chime in on this and address these issues . 
  hebrew was extinct for over a thousand years before it was revived and re-learned for ideological reasons . 
  cultures do n't really die , they simply go to sleep and they can be revived , if there is a will . 
  in a word : nato . 
  so , no . 
  many orthodox jews are forbidden to pray in churches by their rabbis because the whole holy trinity business is such a * massive * break with the tenets of judaism . 
  whereas the same rabbis usually allow jews to pray in mosques because islam is actually less of a break from judaism because a lack of belief in the holy trinity . 
  of course , this is a minority of all jews , but the orthodox jews are typically the most knowledgable of their scripture . 
  secular denominations of judaism are of course far more tolerant , but that is because the inventors of those denominations came out of the european enlightenment . 
   i doubt that anyone would let russia use nukes nobody would be able to stop them , but i do n't see why they would even use nukes . 
  i was just talking about nukes to showcase the * massive * difference in capability between the two nations  a full scale war ? 
  russia could probably win if the military had to emiliorate a civil war . 
   an invasion ? 
  aside from the usa , no one could pull it off . 
  an invasion from the outset would not happen , as i 've already outlined . 
  you arm the kurds , you get the iraqi and syrian kurds to join in , you see turkey become enflamed and * then * you swoop in , deal a decisive blow to the turkish military , restore order then follows . 
  that of course means splitting up the country . 
  anyway , this is all a theoretical discussion since nobody is going to invade turkey , but if it was going to be done , it would most likely be done that way , not an outright invasion from nowhere . 
   there wo n't be a civil war i do n't think you 're doing well on reading comprehension my friend . 
  i 'm not suggesting/predicting there will . 
  i 'm merely talking about how it could be done . 
  as for kurds in the east , you 're deluding yourself if you think its all about the pkk . 
  that 's why the kurdish/turkish conflict has gone on for so long  even then , you ca n't just swoop into turkey to `` stabilize '' the situation while the second biggest army of the nato is defending the country . 
  the united states could definitely do it but not without experiencing huge losses . 
  not a chance . 
  russia could easily destroy turkey 's military if turkey was already engaged in a civil war . 
  they have hypersonic jets and nukes , you have neither ( no , the nukes that the americans are storing in your country is not yours ) . 
   the `` kurds are an oppressed minority '' is kind of absurd . 
  spoken like a true turk . 
  ask the kurds in the southeast with their cities bombed out how `` absurd '' their oppression feels . 
   if you arm the kurds the military/police do n't even have to intervene , the population will take matter into its own hands . 
  as i said , there could be a way to involve kurds from iraq/syria who have a lot of warfare experience . 
  average joe 's with a gun at home but with zero training count for little . 
  my point here is n't that the kurds would win , they would n't . 
  the point is that with a 20-30 % armed population , it would create enough havoc for a civil war , by which then the west and/or russia would swoop in to `` stabilise '' the situation . 
  after which turkey could be carved up into different zones by ethnicity . 
  as i said at the outset : it 's doable . 
  at the same time , why on earth would the western powers and/or russia collude in that way ? 
  what purpose would a divided and destroyed turkey serve ? 
  none . 
  but the question is n't what i wanted , but rather if it 's possible . 
  it 's possible . 
   so strong stronk *, 
  in the uk ? 
  just curious , when was this ? 
  a few years ago , further back ? 
  how did these people get into that school if they were of mediocre academic quality ? 
  `` why are muslims never out there on the street distancing themselves !? '', 
  `` why are they silent !? '', 
  maybe you and i should build a lego airfield and try out different gameplans , jorge . 
  technially speaking you can be * for * democracy and still * against * secularism . 
  after all , if you define as being pro-secularism as the overarching goal , then what 's stopping a secular dictator or a secular military from running the country ? 
  is that democratic ? 
  that was the experience of turkey for most of the 20th century after all . 
   unlike what the guys over at / r/geopolitics believes , geopolitics are not only about acting rationally in the best interest of your country . 
  it is just as much about keeping power and in some cases , ideology and personal values also plays a role .

  i see and agree that this is a collective and unhealthy mental hangup for swedes but it 's not based on nothing . 
  it 's not about poltava . 
  has anyone stated something about british future relations to esa ? 
   they were there from the start i do n't think poland agrees on that one . 
  or well they do but not in a way that makes the ussr or russia look better . 
  russian nukes does not solve your problems of energy dependence . 
  on a unrelated question how is the most expensive building in the world going ? 
  whos ground forces ? 
  and also daesh is loosing ground on all fronts , sdf is less than 10km from raqqa and the iraqi army has taken at least half of mosul and is currently cutting it of from the rest of their territory . 
  they no longer hold any territory outside of syria and iraq . 
  we are just gon na end up with the muscovites taking over novogrod again . 
  i 'm calling it now . 
  how do you get putin to run against putin ? 
   same-personness = zero . 
  ftfy, 
  europe is n't the us . 
  russia has no reason to expect the eu to ` shun ' them in libya . 
  just like the eu is n't in tunisia and was n't in moldova or ukraine . 
  it 's usually impossible to get a nation to recognize historical mistakes or lies . 
  so that 's mostly a non-starter . 
  it would be like russia recognizing it 's transgressions against moldova , georgia or ukraine . 
  as for relations between russia and a revitalized libya i cant see how any one could guarantee such a thing if the eu is going to have it 's way with the new nation being some form of free market democracy . 
  the size of the russian economy in comparison to the eu guarantees that libya would orientate more towards the eu if they were given a free choice . 
  the only way to guarantee any form of more than cordial relationship between russia and libya would be some form of dictatorship and from our point of view i think we would rather see the state split than accepting that . 
  i ca n't say that i really know what the russians want in libya . 
  especially as they support one side but did n't veto the other side getting recognised as the official government by the un and that those sides are n't afaik actually fighting each other right now . 
  as for syria i do n't see what europe has to give that 's worth that much to them . 
  pretty sure the russians would . 
  i have a hard time to see what we have to offer russia that we are willing to give . 
  dialling back sanctions is of the table , and recognizing crimea as russian is not even in the room . 
  so what is there to compromise about ? 
  that is bs . 
  all ` the right ' has done in relations to the eu is to bitch and whine about the cost . 
  sure ` the left ' has complained and moaned about the morals of having a boarder so they were n't any help either . 
  as per usual no side in the eu was willing to look beyond their ideal solution to a problem until there was a medium or bigger crisis brewing . 
  and you seem to be labelling the debate of 2014-2016 in media as the only debate going on . 
  the issue of external eu boarders has been on the table since the early nineties at least . 
  different sides has had the upper hand in different times but a compromise has never been reached . 
  as such the eu has never acted with any measure of force in the issue . 
  so we trade ukraine for libya then ? 
  i do n't think russia would accept that at the current time considering the relations . 
  was there any side that said that they wanted to pay for the boarder controls collectively five years ago ? 
  italy and greece ? 
  the struggle within the eu about how to treat the external borders and frontex has been going for at least a decade . 
  the lack of enough consensus to even have a proper discussion has been glaring . 
  most i have seen have the same shade . 
  it 's probably mostly the photos that are shit . 
  the powerhouse of swedish armaments industry was founded on the expertise of immigrant walloon gun casters . 
  and that is almost relevant . 
  it 's not ` red ' it 's * burgundy * . 
  seriously ? 
  and also : why ? 
  you can see across europe that the breakfast buffets at hotels are becoming more pan-european by the year . 
  we are becoming a federation one danish rybread/french cheese sandwich at a time . 
  who would want to live in a disunited europe if that means that i ca n't dip belgian ( french ? ), 
  chocolate pastry in my black scandinavian coffee every time i stay in a hotel ? 
  i hope ireland will get its [ cable ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/pci_1_6_en_2015.pdf ), 
  amnesty , human rights watch and ` doctors without borders ' are `` collaborating to spread lies about israel around the media '' ? 
  she 's a strong and independent market and needs no permanent partner !, 
  shame on you all for spreading gossip about her !, 
  i think they like the strategic dimension very much but i think it 's partly about improving the competitiveness of the inland and open a middle alternative in the cost/speed calculation . 
  they spent many years trying to convince russia that they should be allowed to pay for and build a standard gauge track from donbass to kazakhstan but putin said no . 
  no , we have to create a new organization to be able to place it 's headquarters in strasbourg so we can get the french to let the eu-parliament stop moving . 
  france needs to have three separate armies . 
  it 's the only way !, 
  i think we should keep ada, 
  if we want to confuse and anger the anglos we can form a eu-comity to create a better english later . 
  the at-4 and javelin are not that comparable as systems . 
  an at-4 weighs a third as much and is single operator . 
  javelin : unit cost us$ 246,000 ( fy2014 ) at-4 : unit cost us$ 1,480.64 they point of at-4 is that everyone can have one . 
  it 's a direct descendant of the panzerfaust and still has the idea that you are supposed to be able to teach civilian kids to use it in less than an hour . 
  i do n't think ( hope ) us troops use javelins to blow holes in walls the way they used to with at-4 . 
   and still said fuck it let 's fuck libya up . 
  was n't libya already pretty fucked up by that point ? 
  or am i missing something ? 
  there is a slight difference in intervening in a country in the middle of a bloody civil war , and invading a country on the other side of the globe for ... 
  i do n't know reasons . 
  also most of the anglosphere seems to forget the for better or worse very special relationship between france and its former colonies in west/north africa . 
   it was a bad pun man that 's some / r/sweden levels of unprovoked shitty puns . 
  well done . 
  yes amos is a cooperation between patria and h\u00e4gglunds . 
  but the patria part of the project was purchased by bofors according to swedish wiki . 
  the swedish procurement department recently ordered 40 amos mounted on cv-90 chassis btw . 
  why would double or single barrels make it harder or easier to find ? 
  the main advantage of nemo in my world is that it can be mounted on our existing combat boats while amos had to much recoil = /, 
  afaik the gotland class is not ocean going . 
  there should be a price estimate for what it costs in an ocean going version as the aussies was offered that a while ago . 
  if we are bragging about superior swedish murder technologies i must recommend [ bonus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bofors_155_bonus ) and [ amos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amos ) ( i think strix as mentioned in that article is a single munition version of bonus ), 
  did n't harley davidson do the same ? 
  mmmm [ bonus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bofors_155_bonus ) you should be able to modify the design of the submunitions to make a version that fits in 122mm . 
  i think it did have those ? 
  did n't it ? 
  i hope mexico will start to call the yank-wall ` the anti fascist defence barrier ' . 
  would an audience at a political debate in the us really be chocked and maybe offended by a political candidate saying that they are n't the greatest country in the world ? 
  is that controversial for real ? 
   us infrastructure transfers between the states are last i checked 10x the whole eu budget ( including the cap ) . 
  the cohesion policy is over 1/3 of the eu budget and is moving towards 1/2 of it so there is n't much need to differentiate between them . 
  the us transfer system seems as most usian things , somewhat arbitrary and in need of constant political bickering . 
  much of the transfers seems to be that spending to achieve common infrastructure or technical goals is placed in the poorer states . 
  but the eu does n't have any such things , esa is n't technically a part of the eu and as such it has a hard time to make it move production to greece .

  you 're right . 
  the uk and france also conveniently ignored the cries for help from their eastern ally . 
  and ignored basically everything nazi germany did prior to invading france . 
  yeah it 's not like a giant south american country speaks portuguese . 
  in times of crisis , it does n't matter whether left of right wins . 
  what 's important is that populists do n't . 
  and i 'm afraid that is not the case here . 
  i agree . 
  it also seems they keep talking about `` data '' as if it mattered . 
  that was a very complicated time . 
  vilnus was both a large center of polish culture and the one and true capital of lithuania . 
  this was a large problem . 
  its main inhabitants were poles and jews . 
  but it was the capital of lithuania from the start for 800 years . 
  both sides wanted it and for good reasons . 
  pilsudski was a polonized lithuanian . 
  he wanted to bring back the commonwealth . 
  the problem was , lithuanians did n't want to , polish nationalists thought it belonged to them , and the soviets just wanted everything . 
  pilsudski 's intentions did n't really work out . 
  the only side that really gained on that war were the damned soviets . 
   most wealthy people evade taxes ftfy . 
  i 'm sorry but that 's the brutal truth wherever you go . 
  since extremely wealthy people will always find ways to stay rich , they do n't need to stop the crisis . 
  so they wo n't . 
  so what you 're saying is , germany should repay all the debts caused by populists in greece ? 
  what about other eu countries ? 
  the facts are this : there is a debt and someone has to pay for it . 
  there is no going around it . 
  the greeks can lose the most if it 's left unpaid . 
  so they have to pay it . 
  it 's not about whose fault is it , it 's about who cares about solving the problem . 
  compare / r/europe to / r/politics . 
  suddenly we 're not so bad at all !, 
  i do n't know where i heard it first but : `` your genes make you want to fuck pussy from far away lands , but your dick makes you want to fuck the nearest one '' . 
  that 's a big problem : there are only a dozen banks or so left in the market . 
  they 're all giants . 
  to create more smaller banks , what can be done ? 
  all the big ones would have to fail first . 
  chernobyl happened a mere 26 years ago . 
  ca n't the russians just give us a break ?

  a water drop hollows a stone not by force , but by falling often . 
  let 's hope that 2032 's headlines from belarus will be about its efforts in joining the eu . 
  romney can not be trusted on his word . 
  he shifts sides according to his sponsors . 
  should he receive enough money , he will adopt any policy . 
  giving money out to banks from taxpayer money is a thing he is very likely to do . 
  but of course he will cut taxes for the rich and for corporations . 
  indeed . 
  it just pisses me off . 
  sure , people make mistakes . 
  but if you submit a post here then please give it more than a second of thought . 
  well , of course scotland would have to re-apply . 
  they need to formally register all the new government contacts and addresses . 
  look , you have to submit papers to the government every time you sell a car or buy one , or change its technical state . 
  no wonder the same applies to the eu membership . 
  the level of condescending assholishness needed to make that comment introduction is breathtaking . 
  sure , thanks for sharing your insights , they 're interesting . 
  but if i lower my etiquette to your level for a second , let me say : that was a joke , you fucking dork . 
  get off of your high horse . 
  if germany left the euro zone , many countries would join the deutsch mark zone , i 'm afraid . 
  it 's important to note that the average value is misleading . 
  sure , if you 're blind and go shopping for random items in the store , you 'll buy the more expensive ones . 
  but the range of prices column is most important if you 're , say , thinking about moving somewhere . 
  or a crappy loaf of bread . 
  seriously . 
  swedish bread is horrendously expensive . 
  i was rather referring to the trend of ` clean coal ' and e.g. 
  reusing coal dust as a building material . 
  a very interesting and sad article . 
  in any case , modern heat and power stations can actually be quite clean and efficient ( up to 90 % ) . 
  power companies do try to not kill us , to an extent . 
  indeed . 
  a 6-day working week was a norm not so long ago in europe . 
  your idea sounds nice in principle , but i 'm not entirely convinced it would work . 
  the devil 's in the details . 
  for a company , to hire an employee means more than to pay his salary . 
  they also pay for social security , healthcare , and other kinds of taxes . 
  you would have to somehow convince companies to hire two people to do the job of one person . 
  to split one full-time salary into two half-time salaries means more expenses for a company , i 'm afraid . 
  oh no no no , sorry , but it 's not as innocent as you paint it . 
  those greeks who were employed in the bloated government institutions enjoyed bonuses for working inefficient jobs . 
  people faking medical conditions . 
  companies avoiding taxes . 
  it 's the same in poland , bulgaria , and many other countries . 
  greece is no different , and their problem encompasses the entire society . 
  half of the working greeks were basically stealing money for many years . 
  there is no painless way of paying it back . 
  well , technically there were almost no christians at the time . 
  they started off as a jewish sect . 
  the head jews were unhappy about having a group that does n't quite listen to them , so they split . 
  i totally agree . 
  there is a very nice historic reason for this particular boundary of europe and asia . 
  take a look at this map of [ roman provinces ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/the_roman_empire_ca_400_ad.png ) . 
  notice that the area west of constantinople is called [ europa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europa_%28roman_province%29 ) . 
  the anatolian peninsula , on the other hand , is called [ asia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asia_%28roman_province%29 ) .

  doubling down rather than admitting to yourself that you 've been fooled is hard to overcome for humans . 
  classic outraged reactionary with no reading comprehension . 
  meant in non european countries they have other priorities being in a developing country than to protest over european models . 
  there are controversies yes , but people do n't care enough to protest it . 
  never knew ukraine was in such a dire state . 
  same reason there 's european advertisement in non european countries . 
  it 's a thing to be desensitized and another thing to show it proudly, 
  i was hoping eu would be that . 
  of course but that nuance is n't used,

  king leopold ll 's atrocities, 
  this is why it 's imperative that there is a superpower which balances and can stand up to american interests . 
  you can in sweden,

  understandable, 
  you have n't been following the atrocities assad regime has been doing committing war crime, 
  do n't throw stones in a glassed house, 
  it does say something about society when they ca n't tolerate a non european model in advertisement, 
  it already shit . 
  fight fire with fire, 
  i certainly hope so , for eu 's sake . 
  why everytime, 
  what are the international community doing about this ? 
  lol from who ? 
  either you side with government or islamic terrorists, 
  i figured it was mostly immigrants who call themselves brits,

  their culture is n't reasonable is an ignorant thing to say . 
  how dare they ask to be treated in accordance to the law . 
  they should keep their mouth shut if they know what 's good for them, 
  where do you live that majority somalis are causing major damage socially ? 
  you ca n't expect an american to know geography, 
  czech politicians have nothing better to do ?

  i doubt you could explain what that culture is,

  let me get back to you and tell mixed people they do n't exist, 
  those types of people do n't care what happens outside the country . 
  they 're isolationist,

  wrong comment, 
  i do n't think british people would 've voted for trump . 
  even ukip see him as decisive, 
  leavers are not in the same category as trump supporters , you 're selling them short . 
  i would n't call them white trash so i see that unproductive , but i also do n't have motivation to change their mind . 
  plus , i have great confidence that sweden wo n't elect swedishdem,

  i do n't believe in that though,

  reading comprehension is not your strong suit, 
  muslims are social conservative but they vote for liberal parties . 
  theresa may is n't that different from status quo of british pm , just her authoritative control over her citizens but that had nothing to do with non british people, 
  nothing is black and white, 
  wtf does intention matter when it uses same characteristics of what a racist person would do ? 
  `` it 's just a prank bro '' is n't going to cut it, 
  you ca n't feel insulted otherwise get out of the country, 
  one man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter, 
  you also need experience . 
  companies have to prove that they could n't find american workers to fill the vacancies, 
  us is n't exactly in eu . 
  you ca n't just waltz in without residential permit or work visa, 
  immigration policy . 
  ca n't even spell the sub right rolf, 
  segregation already happens in france without muslim influence . 
  just ask your black friends to go in bars, 
  most of us who were born here did n't have a choice . 
  would rather live in us, 
  they can move, 
  60 years ago women had less rights than they do now, 
  well in terms of just europe ... 
  islamophobia does exist . 
  this is some r/shitamericansays, 
  absolute haram . 
  i would 've gladly shame those elders if i 'd witness something like that, 
  i can still work , pay my dues , follow the law and not have to except gone countries culture . 
  just do n't complain about integration, 
  nor do people in this thread apparently, 
  how dense can you be ? 
  same refugee ? 
  they have identity crisis, 
  if they 're british it 's understandable why they 're not labeled pakistanis since it 's a nationality . 
  seems like it 's the fault of police incompetence and they 're pushing the blame away . 
  the same reason why middle east is not called south west asia, 
  pakistan is not middle east .

of course , this is a sub with mostly european citizens . 
  obviously a military conflict on european soil will be considered worse for the people who live in europe . 
  it 's not that weird . 
  amen . 
  i 'm still too hungover to see the difference . 
  [ yes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbh3uaz4wum&amp;feature=kp ) , and we 're all pretty hungover today . 
  just as american democrats hijacked the term ` liberal ' . 
  giving up and abandoning parts of the eu is not giving up europe . 
  eu does not equal europe . 
  over my cold dead body . 
  in your previous comment you said this :  what i mean is that there is nothing socialist about the ps . 
  they are purely capitalist , just in favour of a bit more government influence on some issues . 
  you might want to look up want the word capitalist means as well ... 
   also , i would add that in most european countries , lots of essential consumables are vat free never heard of this , which countries ? 
  what does that have to do with it ? 
  they had their [ press conference ] ( http://junilistan.se/2014/02/17/pressmeddelande-junilistan-siktar-p ) less than a month ago and the campaigns have n't really started yet so i do n't blame you . 
  however , they have been noticed in mainstream media at least [ a couple of times ] ( http://www.svd.se/search.do?q=junilistan ) . 
  we also have the june list party making a comeback in the eu elections this year . 
  that [ commercial ] ( http://vimeo.com/57445812 ) almost convinced me that norway is worth protecting . 
  / r/civpolitics /, 
  they 're a lot of things , `` heaps of junk '' is n't one . 
   we still do n't know how many weapons there are . 
  he has licences for 557 , and we suspect he has at least that many , but we 're not sure yet . 
  they 're not sure yet . 
  i 'd guess it 's like / u/igeloktten says , that it comes down to non-approved storage of the weapons and maybe also the grenades . . 
  the swedish krona was the 11th most traded currency during 2013 so there 's no problem in exchanging really . 
  and we 're happy with it , there 's no solid public support for the euro whatsoever . 
  over my cold dead body . 
  just kidding , but no . 
  it wo n't happen . 
  i regret to inform you that there 's no such thing as a `` european citizenship '' . 
  there is however an idea of a so called `` eu citizenship '' which is something you automatically become when you have acquired citizenship in a nation that belongs to the eu . 
  it 's not the united states of europe . 
  malta is an independent democratic nation , as is all other countries that have joined the eu . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that as it 's this kind of ideas that fuel euro skepticism . 
  effectively reducing national democracy and the power of the voter . 
  well , this is as stated by the page of the so called `` eu citizenship '' idea :  it is for each eu country to lay down the conditions for the acquisition and loss of nationality of that country . 
  and by the way , regarding `` eu citizenship '' , have you even read the treaty on the functioning of the european union ? 
  it 's not that much of a big deal . 
  i ca n't really see the downside of this type of immigration whereas there are downsides ( and upsides of course ) to other types of immigration . 
  that 's a pretty twisted view on democracy and the right for malta to choose what 's best for themselves . 
  edit : also from eu 's own page on `` eu citizenship '' :  it is for each eu country to lay down the conditions for the acquisition and loss of nationality of that country . 
  [ doom and gloom ] ( http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/doom+and+gloom ), 
  so you consider yourself in a position to determine how an independent and internationally recognized state should issue their citizenships ? 
  should n't malta independently get to decide who becomes a citizen of their country ? 
  not sure why you 're down voted , feel the exact same way . 
  actually i do n't think i 've ever met anyone that 's 30 + and still live with their parents , sounds sad to be honest . 
  me , i moved to my own place before i turned 18 , best decision of my life . 
  i was there last week , i ca n't give you a count but there are a lot of people at the site . 
  by ukrainian constitution ( third chapter , article 72 ) they should be able to hold referendums as long as they collect 100 000 signatures , do you know if this has been done ? 
  would they be approved with the rate of corruption they have anyway ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  i was actually at the demonstration site last week , it was ( thankfully ) very calm at the time but it was very interesting to see . 
  it 's like a small city within the barricaded perimeter . 
  not sure if the demonstrations are the best solution , yanukovych was still elected democratically . 
  just get rid of him in the elections 2015 . 
  haha , there 's probably some backstory to it . 
  not that i 'm aware of though !, 
  yes , this is a very extreme case but it does make the point fairly well . 
  they would most certainly not call the police , even though we do not greet each other in that way here , 
  it 's real . 
  [ this ] ( http://prussiluska.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/glad-kvinna-i-norberg.jpg )  this thursday around 13 o'clock a women was out walking in the neighborhood of norbergs camping . 
  she met another woman who was out jogging . 
    the jogger looked happy , laughed and greeted the woman as stated by the police report . 
  since the woman did n't know the jogger she felt molested and reported the incident . 
  no , i know . 
  and it 's too bad . 
  converting the fee to a tax might happen in a couple of years though . 
  here both the left and the right supports it more or less , even though the right seems to a bit more in favor of converting the fee to a tax . 
  i think a tax is the right way to go , given that public service is significantly shrunk down to one tv and one radio channel and only programmes that are public service and not entertainment . 
  how about we force everyone that owns a mailbox to pay a `` mail box fee '' which funds a government printed newspaper and then we call that free press . 
  does n't sound like free press to me ? 
  we have more or less the same system with public service consisting of 6 different tv channels ( svt1 , svt2 , svt24 , children 's channel , education channel and svt world ) and four radio channels . 
  the fee of 2 076 sek ( $ 230 ) is mandatory if you own a tv , radio , computer , smartphone , tablet or an internet connection . 
  basically anything with a screen or radio receiver . 
  for me personally , i do n't even have a tv and i do n't own my computer , phone or tablet ( the company i work for owns it ) . 
  however , i have any internet connection at home and because of that i have to pay for 6 tv channels and 4 radio channels which i do n't consume at all . 
  it 's a deeply flawed system with public service that has turned into something way bigger than serving the public , i ca n't understand how anyone would support this , even less the danes who has an even more outrageous fee . 
  the difference is n't at all that big but you 're right , it 's slightly more expensive . 
  however , most of these companies have started in the last two to three years as the demand has been increasing a lot , mostly due to mobile data . 
  markets do n't change overnight but prices are going down , without government intervention . 
  the only reason roaming charges remain is that they provide revenue which is much needed for the expansion of 3g and lte networks , rates change constantly to be competitive as you probably know . 
  what will happen when you cut this revenue and still demand improvements in infrastructure is that subsidizes will have to put in place , so instead of paying the charges which are going down you 'll pay it through your tax statement . 
  in the latter case which you seem to promote there 's also the overhead of bureaucracy , of course . 
   if it moves , tax it . 
  if it keeps moving , regulate it . 
  and if it stops moving , subsidize it .

  you do n't need enforced planned economy like rates , the market is solving this rather well . 
  it 's not black or white . 
  the choice is n't between super high tax society and no society at all . 
  you think income tax is all tax we pay ? 
  the total tax paid by citizens when you start from the amount that the employer designates for the wage is around 70 % for mid-low incomes . 
  that 's theft . 
  there 's no solidarity whatsoever involved in the massive theft commited by our socialist democratic states . 
  60.1 b $ for cap . 
  almost half of the 135.5 b $ . 
  screw that . 
  i would n't label russia as an enemy because that 's outright wrong .

  which is terrible , if it 's true . 
  any victim of rape or crime in general should be supported and encouraged to report it . 
  however , let 's not pretend that there is a norm against reporting crime based on ethnicity . 
  the last part is the most disturbing , that she had the impression that this accusation was not going to be taken seriously . 
  i know that many women feel that way , and it 's a disgrace . 
  any accusation of rape needs to be investigated . 
  of course , for medical , psychological and legal reasons it is important that the victim seeks help immidiately , but for that to become the norm we need to work on our attitudes within society as a whole . 
  old opera was so kickass . 
  it was truly amazing how good it was . 
  my favourite browser was konqueror though . 
  what a beast , in its time . 
  anyways , i hav n't used ff in years so i 'm not sure how it works anymore . 
  but chrome has whitelists for plugins and scripts , so you can make rules for javascript or flash activation natively . 
  it 's not pushbutton easy , but it 's in the gui . 
  i 've turned flash off completely though . 
  too many security issues for my taste . 
  that 's strange though . 
  ff should definitely be able to play this with html5 . 
  plays fine in chrome with flash blocked . 
  i was happy to do it . 
  roseng\u00e5rd is a typical [ miljonprogramsomr\u00e5de ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/million_programme ) , so there 's really not much to see as far as architecture goes . 
  they * do * have an absolutely kickass spice shop at the square though . 
  to be absolutely frank , most people in sweden become total shut-ins in the winter . 
  we try to use a lot of artificial light and candles to make things a little bit better , and lots of people make an effort to stay physically active ( such as cross-country skiing and indoor team sports ) , but on the whole people are very withdrawn . 
  it 's * loads * better if it 's very snowy , because then you at least get the reflection of the snow for extra light . 
  warm winters are * the worst * . 
  the problem is n't really the short days -- the problem is that we * stay inside * working or at school for the few hours of daylight that we have . 
  i think we need to change our working hours during the winter but that 's never going to happen . 
  most countries do n't take family reunification seriously . 
  the guy probably knows exactly where his family is ; most likely some refugee camp .

  yes . 
  i do n't have any numbers really , but i 'd say about 75 % of sweden 's population live in the southernmost half of sweden . 
  have you heard about `` natural causes '' ? 
  death can come unexpected , even to someone who seemed healthy . 
  they use the same times as mecca . 
  the most important rule about fasting is to not harm yourself or anyone else . 
  stockholm is actually at 1/3rd of sweden 's length . 
  roseng\u00e5rd is not a no-go zone , holy shit . 
  it 's actually quite nice . 
  all kinds of people , lots of kids playing . 
  i 'm not going to say that it 's an amazing place to grow up , i would n't know . 
  but the tales of roseng\u00e5rd being a warzone are complete and utter nonsense . 
  yeah . 
  it 's about a bunch of ~ ~ xenophobic ~ ~ racist poles . 
  their opinions are not evidence of any thing other than their racism . 
  how is this relevant ? 
  are you fucking trolling me or what ? 
  the same as the difference between either of those and a terrorist act commited by a blonde blue-eyed man who was afraid of muslims . 
  keep up ffs . 
  well , no . 
  that was n't me . 
  but it 's still the truth . 
  confronted by the truth , you responded with a strawman . 
  i know that you 're good at strawmen . 
  you 're the one that asked if it matters if the terrorist is newly radicalized or not . 
  no need to show off , i 'm already convinced . 
  these investigations are not done by the case workers , but by experts . 
  usually it 's a firm that employs people of different ethnicities with good knowledge of different accents and geography . 
  are the 80 kids killed by a blonde blue-eyed man that was scared of muslims any less dead because he did n't praise muhammed ? 
  yeah but at least those are * our own * / s, 
  well , actually , i strongly disagree with saying that ideology * causes * terrorism . 
  terrorism has ideological manifestations , but the anger and the acts themselves are probably rooted elsewhere . 
  but i do apologize for the hyperbole . 
  i am an asshole . 
  terrorist attacks are usually politically motivated . 
  now , i 'm not saying that religion is an unimportant factor . 
  religion itself is problematic and islam in particular is in a bad state . 
  neither will i draw attention from the fact that there are religiously motivated attacks in many middle eastern countries , that directly target certain sects of islam or that target christians . 
  we have also seen the destruction of secular artifacts in syria and iraq . 
  all of this has a strong ideological and religious component . 
  however , there 's more to it than just religion or ideology . 
  lone wolf terrorists are extermely rare . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but breivik is the only example of a successful lone wolf attacker in europe , right ? 
  any future terrorist attacks in europe are most likely to be commited by people that have lived here for at least 10-15 years . 
  daesh could possibly send terrorists to europe , and could * easily * push europe over the edge as the population is open to that sort of thing right now . 
  but i do n't see how they would benefit anything from that . 
  the last thing they want is further involvment in their region . 
  they thrive on fear , not outrage . 
  are we just making shit up now ? 
  them being rich has nothing to do with anything . 
  of course i agree that saudi arabia should take in refugees , just as i believe that they should give women basic rights and not be a a racist and fascist dynasty that supports terrorism . 
  it 's not going to happen and that 's not the fault of other arab nations . 
  saudi arabia is a troll . 
  do n't feed the trolls . 
  yeah , well that 's the problem though . 
  it 's one thing to say that `` the influx of such and such numbers of refugees will destabilize europe , '' which is of course bullshit in and of itself . 
  and a completely different thing to say `` the aim of the refugees is to destabilize europe '' . 
  both statements are worrisome , but the second one is * way * worse . 
  i did n't expect that of romania . 
  yeah , i 'm used to it . 
  i have hyperbole and shitty comments too , but very often every single one of my reasonable ones * suddenly * go down to at least 0 or -1 karma . 
  i see it as a sign that one guy clicked my profile and just spammed the downvote button on everything . 
  are you implying that the * purpose * of the smugglers or the refugees is to destabilize europe ? 
  how europe reacts is irrelevant to the statement itself . 
  ok , here 's your chance . 
  what do you prefer to be called ?

  i 'm well are of that . 
  my point is that the end result is still the same though , and it does n't matter if you have a constitution saying you have freedom of speech , when you are not actually capable of exercising it . 
  based on the news coming from your universities , it seems like you still have a problem despite it being unconstitutional . 
  not just france . 
  this will completely change the way that europe handles the immigrants . 
  thousands , perhaps millions of immigrants will be negatively affected . 
  anti-immigration will rise . 
  this will massively fuel the right-wing parties everywhere . 
  segregation and racism will increase dramatically , from both sides as europeans become more suspicious and the muslims begin to feel like suspected terrorists by default this will have huge negative impacts , for both europeans and immigrants , for a long time . 
  and the worst thing is that there is nothing we can do about it . 
  if we go right wing and smash down hard on immigration , we will breed hatred amongst the immigrants already here . 
  if we take the tolerant route , we will just invite more attacks by showing that we are weak and they can get away with it . 
  there is really no good response to this . 
  if you truly live in sweden , and thus probably know swedish ( which i at this point doubt ) , you would know that graph is about total crimes across all categories . 
  in regards to * violent crime * which i clearly stated above , it 's reducing https://www.bra.se/bra/brott-och-statistik/vald-och-misshandel.html, 
  i am quite consistent in my opinions on tthis . 
  ibelieve that there are objectively superior and objectively inferior humans . 
  however , that metric is completely unrelated to sex , race , religion or whatever . 
  it is completely based on the choices that each individual make . 
  and a person who choose to murder children for his own fame or political agenda is objectively inferior , no matter which policy he does it for . 
  some rightwing fuckhead who have been listening to braindead circlejerks too long . 
  an objectively inferior human , who have probably never done anything to contribute or earn credit in the socity he so aggressively `` defended '' today by showing its worst side . 
  that 's what this dude was . 
  not some sort of glorious representative against the immigration in europe . 
  the funny thing is that people like you , who scream so loudly about the superiority of our society , are the absolutely least worthy to represent it . 
  trying to score cheap political points by somehow twisting the acts of a deranged murderer of immigrants into an argument against immigration is not the truth , it 's just someone with his head waaaay too far up his own ass . 
  given how the attacker was a native who targeted muslims , should we respond by saying `` this is how palestina feels , israel ? '', 
  except that violent crime in sweden is lower than ever . 
  simple . 
  not easy . 
  i never said it was easy . 
  and yeah , i do realize that it sucks . 
  but it 's the choice you have to make . 
  die from complications due to your obesity or drug abuse , or suffer through the process of getting rid of it . 
  that 's reality , and no matter how much patchwork we put on these people in the hospitals , it still wo n't help them unless they help themselves . 
  and until they help themselves , those money could be spent on those who do . 
  by choosing how you eat and exercise , day after day , you consciously or unconsciously makes a choice to be fat . 
  and by not doing anything about it , you are making a daily choice to remain fat . 
  losing , or gaining , weight is an incredibly simple process . 
  and by now , everybody should be more than well aware of how to lose it . 
  and if they do n't , the doctor will in 5 minutes explain to them how . 
  people who do extreme sports already pay for special insurances . 
  also , in many cases there is little left of them to perform a surgery on . 
  the major factor here is that the things you talk about are * accidents . 
  * accidents happen . 
  extreme sports-practicers also take a lot of precautions to prevent injuries . 
  overeating and smoking is the exact opposite . 
  the other major factor is that obesity is rising and it is a huge problem for society and healthcare . 
  we do n't have a problem with an extreme-sports epidemic that requires special legislation . 
  same way we do n't have an epidemic of aids patients , so we do n't need to pass laws on condom usage and healthcare because it 's not a major problem . 
  obesity is a major problem . 
  if 30 % of the population was abusing steroids , leading to fucktons of medical costs , i 'd say it would be a good time to limit medical availability for steroid users as well . 
  and if we had tens of thousands of skydivers die or get disabled every year , i do n't think anybody would hesitate to tell them to pay for their own emergencies . 
  obesity is a conscious choice , done every single day , for years on end . 
  the same with smoking . 
  car accidents can happen because of a momentary lapse of concentration . 
  you do n't just accidentally get fat because you fell asleep at a mcdonalds . 
  when peoples life choices cost society billions of euros yearly in easily-preventable diseases , then i as part of that society have the right to object . 
  not to mention the massive drain on the environment that obesity is . 
  are you ok with people living casually on welfare as well ? 
  after all , it is their life choice , is n't it ? 
  oh they can get healthcare . 
  they just should n't be getting bandaid-surgeries that will only be a waste of money because the underlying cause of the problem remains unchanged . 
  as i said , we do n't live in a magical wonderland of endless resources . 
  if someone is just soaking up thousands of pounds because they 'd rather get a bunch of surgeries than eat less or quit smoking , then they need to be taught the concept of action and consequence . 
  and since they do n't care about others , these limits should at least make them care about themselves . 
  the money wasted on these people could be put into actual issues that is n't easily solved by some personal responsibility . 
  well , i agree . 
  if you lead an actively unhealthy lifestyle , becomes sick due to said lifestyle and then refuse to change , then you should not be given free treatment for it either . 
  it 's not as if the law says that fat people with a heart attack will be turned away in the door . 
  but it does say that fat people needing certain surgeries will be required to lose weight first , which is perfectly sensible . 
  if you are sick due to alcohol abuse , you should be required to participate in a treatment program as well . 
  healthcare is n't free , and throwing away money on people who will just get sick again , and who have 100 % control over it , is not a good use of healthcare money . 
  what an utterly childish comment . 
  my life is actually quite excellent . 
  skydiving , scuba-diving , martial arts . 
  yep , riding a horse is dangerous . 
  which is why you tend to wear protection for it . 
  and it 's also not an activity that 70 % of the population engage in , nor is it an activity that has a pretty much guaranteed mortality rate . 
  * some * horse riders injure themselves , in accidents . 
  obesity and smoking is not an accident . 
  a vast majority of obese and smokers gets sick . 
  if you were an alcoholist refusing treatment , i 'd say the same rules should apply to you . 
  did he pay ? 
  he expects others to pay for him.he has gotten numerous surgeries , have done nothing to actually change his lifestyle , and still expects others to pay for it . 
  much like you apparently want others to pay for your shitty habits . 
  if we lived in a magical wonderland where we had infinite resources , i would n't care what the hospitals did . 
  but they have budgets , and the people with the least priority should be the ones who actively choose unhealthy habits and refuse to improve . 
  dangerous jobs and vehicle accidents are consequences of necessity . 
  we need vehicles . 
  we need dangerous jobs . 
  we do n't need smoking and overeating , they fulfill no function whatsoever . 
  i would that sports injuries could be a problem if we were suffering from some sort of epidemic of them . 
  but we are not , and most of those injuries probably comes also from obese people who wear down their joints . 
  stds can be irreversible and can easily happen by mistake . 
  owning cars is a necessity for many people . 
  smoking and overeating is not caused by accident , nor is it a necessity , and it can be reversed at any time . 
  we are also not suffering from a society-debilitating epidemic of poor drivers and std-transmitters , while obesity rates are skyrocketing , meaning that one problem here is clearly far bigger than the rest . 
  i 'm surprised to see so much objections to this . 
  for me it 's a perfectly sensible decision .

  they can do whatever they want , as long as i do not have to pay for them . 
  unfortunately , their unwillingness to change and their corruption means that they cost me money too , and , probably my non existing children . 
  i mean , i do n't rant about eucadors corruption , or moldovas bad choices . 
   how did you get to the conclusion that southern europe excuses everything with non-scientific arguments you excuse them with non scientific arguments . 
  and , i do n't know how many greeks that has told me about the dictatorship as a reason for not being productive . 
  when i point out the baltic states , china , brazil etc , countries who has/have it rougher and certainly ( in particular china ) has had dictatorship far later . 
  it is an excuse i am getting tired off , it is non scientific , not backed up by anything but southern europe uses it . 
  i think they should stop making up excuses and deal with the issue at hand . 
   you need economies that are as diverse as possible trading with each other . 
  yes , diverse is good for trading . 
  * not * for being in a federation or in a union , certainly not a currency union , and * not * for money transfers outside of trade . 
  read about [ optimum currency area ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/optimum_currency_area )  yes , they should have gotten their shit together . 
  and they refused to . 
  why should i be punished , and my children and grandchildren for their refusal to act like responsible persons ? 
  what more , you actually do n't help someone by just bailing them out the whole time . 
  permanent money transfers can be harmfult , that is a lot of economical theories behind that . 
  just look at africa . 
  if the perment transfered worked , then some of those countries would n't be as poor as they are . 
  same for southern europe . 
  they have to take responsibility as a country , and they are not . 
  instead they are blaming everyone but themselves . 
  only southern europe can fix southern europe . 
  so , more permanent transfers is a bad idea . 
   the rules that we have are shit anyway . 
  if one do not like the rules one leaves , or re-negotiates . 
  one do * not * ignore them and forces everyone else to bail you out . 
   without political will there is no rules . 
  well , if one is not a complete madman , one lives up to the obligations . 
  that is how politics works , if one is not insane . 
  one follows treaties . 
   actually the eurozone stability and growth treaty allows to a qualified majority to skip the sanctions . 
  no , not really . 
  futhermore , it does no allow for bailout , transferring of debt , debt forgiveness , or the fact that ecb intervenes on behalf of individual countries . 
  all that is against treaties and ecb rules ...  what are they going to do ? 
  let countries leave . 
  not bail them out . 
  we do not have a federation . 
  if one put oneself in the shitter , one should dig oneself out of it . 
   was n't cutting acces to eu funds to regional development funds to countries with too much debt the only possible fine ? 
  do not think so . 
  kick countries out , and force them to pay a fine for example . 
   germany was the the first country in break the agreement without consequences . 
  no , not at all . 
  greece , italy and belgium started out with a far bigger debt/gdp ratio than they should have ( maybe france too ) . 
  then everyone else followed . 
   what i see like very german is expecting that the spanish government will do something only because it 's in the spanish constitution . 
  they will pretend and the court will say that is enought as usual . 
  i can write too much about this . 
  another proof that the euro is messed up and not working , nor is the eu, 
   i disagree with you that you 're correct . 
  prove me wrong then . 
  i 'd like to see you prove to me that southern europeans do * not * vote for corrupt bastards like berlusconi . 
  what more , i 'd like for you to prove that they do not cheat far , far more on their taxes , and pay less while at it . 
  also , i 'd like for you to prove that they are less corrupt . 
  also , i 'd like for you to prove that it will be less permanent transfers to the south with a federation . 
  start with that . 
  and , i 'd like real proof , as in credible links . 
  i am at the uni , so i have access to all scientific journals . 
  i am sorry , but if you say that i am wrong , i expect you to prove it . 
   uk had 240 % debt during the napoleonic wars . 
  are you serious ? 
  who cares , we have never paid for them !, 
  it was 200 years ago . 
  are you saying that my grandchildren will have to pay for greece 's non productive corrupt grandchildren ? 
   greece joined in 1981 , spain and portugal joined in 1986 . 
  both of them have a history you might want to look up , even italy does.you do n't fix a country overnight , and even if you want to ... look at eastern europe ( which to be honest , has much less fault in their history as it was pushed down their throats ... ) so , you are saying that greece that came out of dictatorship in * 1974 * and spain in * 1977 * ( i belive ) , and italy in ** 1945 ** had an ** harder ** time than the baltic states that ** did n't even exist ** . 
  talk about getting things showed down their throats-they fucking did n't even exists as a country . 
  what you are saying is not only historically incorrect , you are extremely disrespectful towards eastern europe . 
  in fact , you are just making shit up . 
  i 'd like you to post scientific evidence that greece , italy and spain have had no chance to fight the corruption and develop properly and become productive . 
  scientic evidence please , as in well known economic journals . 
  otherwise , you are just making stuff up . 
  as i said , countries who had it way worse , korea , china , brazil has pulled * themselves * up . 
  they had it far , far worse than southern europe ( how many millions died on you in the last 50 years ) yet you ignore those . 
   generally , zones which are economic powerhouses are going to be net contributors and zones less developed are going to be net receivers . 
  sigh , that changes . 
  in the time of that napoleonic war you are so fond of , we were dirt poor in northern europe , so you are not talking about a scientific law . 
  what irritates me is that you play it like southern europe do not have a choice . 
  of course they do . 
  they choose not to pay taxes , vote for dirtbags and not become productive . 
  they have choices . 
  when estonia was deep in trouble and reforming their economy , greece was living high on our money . 
  again - it is about the choices one makes . 
  why are you excusing that ? 
  you are just playing southern europe as a victims . 
  they are not , they have chosen every single game . 
  there are no special circumstances that excuses southern europes lack of development , refusal to deal with corruption ( how can you excuse southern italy . 
  it has n't been fixed in 70 years . 
  how much more time do you need ? ) . 
   if i grow up in france and the gov pays for my security , healthcare , education , etc. 
  they are going to have a deficit.what happens when i get to 18 and instead of paying taxes there i move to germany and pay taxes there that question is n't even relevant until now , since the transfer of people in between eu countries has been very low . 
  so , no excuse for the poor perfomance in the south . 
  i think one of the biggest transfers were between the nordic countries btw . 
  sweden have something like 10 % of finns . 
  that does n't seem to have harmed finland . 
  so again , you are making stuff up . 
   although , it 's not like the rest of the countries that you hold in regard have been respecting the 60 % gdp and 3 % deficit standard . 
  i agree , the euro area is generally in trouble and no one cares about the rules . 
  again , some more questions . 
  how many more decades of southern europe not giving , but receiving ?

  glad you enjoy it . 
  our of curiosity , do you do the same thing between you at the iberian peninsula ? 
  are they endangered here ? 
  nope . 
  do we have tightly regulated hunting ? 
  yes are lions endangered ? 
  yes . 
  is hunting of lions well regulated ? 
  nope . 
  there you go . 
  [ corruption is rife in the [ spanish judiciary ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/08/us-spain-corruption-idusbrea070au20140108 ) , as well as [ local government ] ( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0176268012000353 ) . this is common knowledge . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2009/03/why_is_spain_so_corrupt ) is also a good article that compares our countries , among others . 
  [ nope ] ( http://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results ) . 
  cold be it , he might be trying to make himself understood , in a danish fashion . 
  no , we 're not a nearly as corrupt as spain . 
  do n't make us send our politicians to you !, 
  which means ? 
  would n't expect anything less from norway . 
  yes , he dislikes gardells ' humor and the weirdos in the pride parade , what is the controversy ? 
  i never claimed it was fabricated . 
  i do however absolutely think they 'll use the worst angle possible . 
  as they did in the article with gardell 's hyperbole . 
  i would say a paper like svd , di or aff\u00e4rdsv\u00e4lden , i.e. 
  not a tabloid like expressen . 
  jonas gardell is a `` character '' , there is nothing offensive in that description . 
  also expressen is hardly a credible source as it colludes with leftist extremists to register political opponents . 
  furthermore , he also is n't really saying anything that 'd be considered extremist outside of the swedish media circle jerk . 
  as for your second claim , it seems to lack a functioning source . 
  do you have any credible sources for your claims ? 
  it 's spain ; you can always bribe someone . 
  not to the extent that nafta absolutely slaughtered manufacturing , steel et.al . 
  that is not the case , you 're over simplifying to make it fit your lill neat view of reality . 
  if we actually look the developments within the us middle class i.e. 
  the economic backbone of any western country it has seen its incomes dwindle , especially the now former middle class in the rustbelt / midwest . 
  just because some fucking fat-cats and/or companies have a much higher worth and can distribute more to its shareholders does n't mean that the country is better of , there is no such correlation . 
  you honestly think that ravaging the middle class , increased concentration of wealth and the financialization us has benefited the average american ? 
  since it hyas `` benefited the whole country '' ? 
  in what way is the country now better of ? 
  you 're the one who should educate yourself , rather than parroting the theoretics of macro a. 
  you 're essentially arguing that gdp is good a measure of how good a society is of . 
  i should have been specific - it ca n't have a conflict with a member state ( and i think other candidate countries ) , hence turkey . 
  as for your examples the ageean one between greece and turkey is indeed a good one , but i 'm not actually sure whether this one is subject to other international laws . 
  come on , the economy was based to a substantial part on money laundering , it was the entry point of russian mob money into the eu all the way until the crash . 
  at that is had/has major issues with human trafficking . 
  man i do not envy the spy that has to note what kinda porn german politicians watch . 
  it is bound to be something degenerated and ungodly enough to send the poor spy to therapy for years . 
  no , i 'm mearly saying that greece blackmailed the eu . 
  if we were to look at the core requirements to join one is that you ca n't have a territorial conflict with neighbours , which cyprus has . 
  also , cyprus was n't ready to join , its economy as an example was a racket . 
  this does n't mean that i do n't think the turks should be driven of the island to put an end to their illegal occupation . 
  ask the average american worker residing in the `` rust belt '' about nafta . 
  ah , another outsourcing agreement . 
  this 'll surely benefit the average eu worker in industries and such . 
  [ here you go , read the whole page 59 to catch up on some of that fine greek `` solidarity '' ] ( https://books.google.se/books?id=bqemagaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa59&amp;lpg=pa59&amp;dq=eastern+enlargement+greece+veto&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ne1iwlihcn&amp;sig=se-qjg8g-iobt1cpyvrd_8dkoay&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ccoq6aewawovchmiwlpfhrbvxgivxa0sch3ieq1b#v=onepage&amp;q=eastern%20enlargement%20greece%20veto&amp;f=false ) . 
  edit : as a bonus , [ here you can read about the time greece blackmailed the eu in connection with the spanish & portugese eu-accession , pages 14-15 . 
  do please note that it is a pdf ] ( http://aei.pitt.edu/43444/1/cunha_eec_3rd_enlargement.pdf ) . 
   or i could even argue that poland and the baltics did benefit of the greek solidarity when we did n't veto their eu membership back in ' 04 , at a time when they were probably behind the european standards wow , really ? 
  greece blackmailed the eu to include cyprus in that enlargement . 
  so much for greek `` solidarity '' . 
  just like when greece blackmailed the eu in teh spanish & portuguese enlargement , that time for a loan . 
  mad has been reliant on second strike capability since the inception on submarine based delivery systems . 
  this missile shield would not upset this balance . 
  i 'm sorry sir , this store is fresh out of spending . 
  however , could i perhaps interest you in a referendum ? 
  are we going down this road again ? 
  the road were we pretend not to understand that these loans are to keep the greek state afloat regarding its financial commitments . 
  they might as well cross out the swedish ones , as they are n't particularly high speed . 
  if they push forward with more federalization i 'd wager that beyond the uk also scandinavian countries will exit the eu . 
  i would love to , we 'd have to change our government first though , since they ca n't cooperate with you or our other neighbours in a good manner . 
  there 'd need to be policy convergence in the sense that we adapt to the rest of you . 
  have fun !, 
  god i 'm happy we 're outside of that cluster fuck that is the ez . 
  in case of paywall ;  the euro might be worse for you than bankruptcy . 
   that , at least , has been the case for finland and the netherlands , which have actually grown less than iceland has since 2007 . 
  iceland , you might recall , basically went bankrupt in 2008 . 
   now , it 's true that finland and the netherlands have had their fair share of economic problems , but those should have been manageable . 
  neither country is a basket case , and both have done what they were supposed to do . 
  in other words , they 've followed the rules , and the results have still been a catastrophe . 
  that 's because the euro itself is . 
  or , if you want to be polite , the common currency is `` imperfect , and being imperfect is fragile , vulnerable , and does n't deliver all the benefits it could . '', 
  that was european central bank chief mario draghi 's verdict on thursday . 
   so what 's happened to them ? 
  well , just your run-of-the-mill bad economic news . 
  it 's only a slight exaggeration to say that apple has kneecapped finland 's economy . 
  its two biggest exports were nokia phones and paper products , but , as the country 's former prime minister alex stubb has said , the iphone killed the former and the ipad killed the latter . 
  now , the normal way to make up for this would be to cut costs by devaluing your currency , except that finland does n't have a currency to devalue anymore . 
  it has the euro . 
  so instead it 's had to cut costs by cutting wages , which not only takes longer , but also causes more economic damage since you have to fire people to convince them to take pay cuts . 
  the result has been a recession longer than anything in finland 's living memory , longer even than its great depression in the early 1990s . 
  it has n't helped , of course , that the rules of the euro zone have forced finland 's government to cut its budget at the same time that all this has been happening . 
   it 's been a different kind of story in the netherlands . 
  its goods are more than competitive abroad -- its trade surplus is an absurd 10 percent of economic output -- but its domestic spending is a problem . 
  the netherlands had a huge housing bubble , fueled , in part , by the fact that interest payments are fully tax deductible , that has since deflated some 20 percent . 
  that 's left dutch households with a bigger debt burden than anyone else in the euro zone . 
  on top of that , there 's been the usual austerity to keep its recovery from being much -- or any -- of one . 
  indeed , the netherlands ' economy was slightly smaller at the end of 2014 than it was at the end of 2007 . 
  that 's a lot better than finland , whose economy has shrunk 5.2 percent during that time , but , as you can see below , it still lags the 1.1 percent growth iceland has eked out . 
   now , it 's hard to do worse than iceland . 
  it basically turned its entire economy into a hedge fund that collapsed in 2008 . 
  its banks defaulted , its government had to be bailed out , and its currency collapsed 60 percent .

why not ? 
  why keep the u.s or france but not russia ? 
  neutrality ? 
  why would you move from sweden to the u.s ? 
  i get going on a holiday there or something but moving there for anything less than a well paying job seems crazy . . 
  honestly i do n't think it gets much worse than -25 c in most of sweden . 
  but i can imagine ( as a swede who 's never been to poland ) that it 's a different type of cold . 
  we also have a lot of wind and snowstorms so that probably makes the winters here rougher . 
  i live sort of in between the middle and the north of the country btw . 
  right , and the point of this video is ? 
  are you actually trying to say that the u.s. is a good country ? 
  it 's done a lot more harm than it has good on a global level . 
  give it a try translating !, 
  really curious how close or languages actually are so it 'd be fun, 
  man its cool seeing his old one from last year , the weight loss progress , the pregnant wife turning into a rock band, 
  shoo , go away . 
  it seems to be a thing with the language . 
  most native swedish speaking finns i 've met have been calm , friendly people . 
  finnish speaking people are much more loud , angry looking and generally grumpy . 
  in my very limited experience of course haha . 
  you are right about both deserving praise for their wartime efforts . 
  but . 
  there is no way in hell to justify the way churchill treated , amongst other , the indians . 
  saying that it was n't as bad as stalin is such a bad argument . 
  at some point it does n't matter if more died or more suffered , what matters is the reasoning behind , the powers that were at play and the amount of responsibiilty the leaders had for things turning out the way they did . 
  i 'd actually reckon stalin had less to do with how the soviet union was run than churchill had with the british colonies . 
  but one was a westerner so he 's praised and the other was an `` evil communist '' so . . 
  there are brits who praise churchill . 
  same . 
  i mean most of the time you are * on * the toilet when pooping * in * it ... 
  aight . 
  fuck it then . 
  my bad . 
  what 's lithuania got to do with anything ? 
  i only said that scotland was way closer to the nordic nations than the baltics - estonia . 
  not really since they have a lot of historical and cultural ties to the nordics . 
  their language and english dialects are heavily influenced by old norse . 
  their isles used to be populated by norse speaking people . 
  we have interacted with them for a very very long period of time and share a large amount of cultural traits . 
  them and estonia are probably the strongest contenders for a `` nordic membership '' or whatever . 
  even more than the other baltic nations . 
  is it not a good thing that we pay a lot in taxes ? 
  fun . 
  killing people is humour . 
  people are only critical to things that do n't fit their world view . 
  i have one very vivid memory of hanging with my older sister as a kid . 
  she introduced me to a friend of hers that is black and said : `` look patrichh !, 
  this is david , he 's a nigger ! '', 
  i was four and very confuffeled . 
  to be fair she was a white , seventeen year old girl from a small town in northern sweden . 
  fan va fint . 
  fuck that 's nice . 
  i 'm so happy we do something useful with the rubbish . 
  \u00c4sch , do we even still do that ( assuming you mean literally and not sd ) . 
  yeah i live just a couple miles south of sundsvall so practically the same weather . 
  i 'd never move south in my life . 
  if i 'm moving it 's gon na be even further into the middle of nowhere in the north . 
  oh it is n't at all too much work . 
  it 's actually way easier than walking through snow , especially since you use your whole body rather than only your legs . 
  there 's quite a bit of technique to it thought but as soon as you 've got down even the most unfit person can do it and enjoy it , lots . 
  source : fatty . 
  hahaha yea . 
  downhill is also very very popular but i did n't have anyone to teach me as a kid and to be honest i 'm a bit of a coward when it comes to that stuff so . 
  should n't prison more be about rehabilitation than punishment though ? 
  oh it 's cross country btw . 
  not like downhill haha . 
  it 's pretty much always dark in the winter so yeah we have to . 
  it 's actually pretty nice if you 've got a headlamp or something . 
  a bit creepy though at times . 
  true . 
  the wether right now is pretty shitty . 
  it 'll be my first winter ever without snow on christmas if this continues . 
  i 'm a swede but the climate 's pretty much the same and i love it . 
  sure summers are nice but nothing beats going skiing in the cold , dark winter and coming back inside the warmth and having a nice hot cup of gl\u00f6gg . 
  yeah in europe . 
  in many parts of asia though it 's a very common symbol still . 
  uh yeah they would . 
  nope . 
  just like some people in vietnam do n't * have * to work in sweatshops . 
  i mean , they 'll starve if they do n't but they do n't * have * to . 
  yep . 
  millions thrown at the working class individuals of romania to build a better country from . 
  it 's this individuals fault that his country ca n't provide security for him in the same way the uk or sweden can . 
  it 's this random romanian person on reddits `` victim complex '' diagnosed by another random redditor that is holding back all of romania . 
  socialism would solve this . 
  i 'm willing to bet working conditions are a lot better for north koreans than the majority of the workers europeans hire in myanmar , china , afghanistan and so on . 
  no it does n't . 
  superk\u00e5t means super horny . 
  o is not \u00c5 . 
  but . . 
  they 're wearing the hijab for religious reasons , so if they were n't religious they would n't wear it . 
  that 's like saying `` how many would marry in a church if there never was christianity or churches ? 
  by that definition everything we do is childhood indoctrination . 
  why would we have christmas trees if we do n't celebrate christmas ? 
  like , there 's no argument left . 
  who 's to say the swedish politicians did n't decide for themselves to wear a headscarf ? 
  hahaha what does that have to do with what the above commenter wrote ? 
  s/he did n't write anything about driving or funding salafist mosques , we 're talking about wether or not you 're forced to wear a hijab lol, 
  `` is probably minimal '' what does that even mean ? 
  you 're pulling shit out of your ass .

  you can send a squad of hitmen to the other side of the planet to get rid of insurgents . 
  never before in history of mankind was this possible . 
  our laws govern * every aspect of life * . 
  it 's unprecedented . 
  17th century man would be terrified by the intensity and reach of government control . 
  in the past there are many great individuals who sparked revolutions . 
  moral , religious , scientific , political ... they were hunted down and executed for their views . 
  sometimes they did n't mind that , having a heroic attitude , ideals larger than life . 
  today , a government can shut you up before you have your views heard . 
  historically , scientists were always trying to work * despite * the state . 
  many people with new , unconventional ideas about the world have been burned , coerced and subdued . 
  once science was able to deliver new fantastic weaponry and means of control , it was tamed and put on a leash . 
  today , science is a tool in the hands of governments and companies . 
  how many scientists work at l'oreal ? 
  far more than we need . 
  it does n't matter much whether something is publicly or privately owned . 
  powerful entities such as large corporations continue to consolidate their power further and further . 
  a single person can do absolutely nothing about it ; not can an entire society , in fact . 
  four banks own 60 % of the financial sector in america . 
  banks amounted to 10 % of the economy in 1950 . 
  today that number is around 40 % . 
  that should be terrifying news . 
  but it 's not discussed at all . 
  i can see how you view alarmist news on almost all subreddits . 
  i tend to agree . 
  but what i think is that the internet , much like any media , focuses on hysteria instead of causes of the malice we pretend to fight against . 
  the atrocities of nazi germany , for instance , were rooted in two things : the first was the misfortune of the german people . 
  but that alone does n't push people to war . 
  what was needed was an artificial enemy : the * untermensch * . 
  totalitarian governments always point towards an external enemy , creating a division between `` them '' and `` us '' . 
  modern media do the very same . 
  constantly looking for scapegoats , they raise hysteria because it makes money . 
  there are small freedoms and large freedoms . 
  freedom of movement around europe will become pretty insignificant if all countries in europe devolve into oligarchies . 
  an american can move wherever he/she wants , but wherever he ends up , it 's more or less the same . 
  in any case , i agree with you that we 're panicking . 
  but i think we 're right to be guarded - it 's just that our hysteria is severely misguided . 
  what 's worse , smoking and drinking is an extremely bad combination . 
  smoking contracts your blood vessels . 
  it 's their defensive reaction . 
  in turn , alcohol widens your blood vessels , so that defense is compromised . 
  look , do n't be so pretentious about knowing some high school math . 
  we 're talking about a ratio of a number ( our production difference ) and a non-negative number ( our original production ) . 
  in this example , our x can not be negative , as your production can not be negative . 
  so if you divide production ( time2 ) - production ( time1 ) ------------------------------ production ( time1 ) we get limit with production ( time1 ) --  0 . 
  for readability 's sake , if we define x2 - production ( time2 ) x1 - production ( time1 ) x1 = 0 , x2 = 1 we get a limit x2 - x1 lim -------- = + inf x1 -  +0 x1 now , i have no fucking clue why in the first place you wrote  fiy 0 * \u221e = 0 it 's not relevant to this little example . 
  if you wrote a computer script that calculated the rate of relative change of production , for a change from 0.00001 to 1 it would saturate your output and give you an enormously large number . 
  and assuming you can not have negative production , it would mathematically be infinity . 
  what a waste of time . 
  first of all , 0 * \u221e is an undefined number . 
  you need to specify what kind of 0 and what kind of \u221e we 're talking about . 
  for instance , for x approaching 0 , if you multiply x * 1/x , you get 1 , and not zero . 
  if you multiply x * 1/x ^ 2 , you get \u221e . 
  as for the \u221e % change in production : the absolute daily change would be 1 . 
  on the first day , you divide the absolute change by the previous number . 
  so you get 1/0 = \u221e, 
  then again it 's easy to have a large relative growth when you have almost nothing . 
  if production went from 0 to 1 pencil per day , that would be an infinity % of growth . 
  from what i 've heard , you have quite a vigorous bustling tear gas industry , spreading its products all over the world !, 
  in the past , revolutionaries and great individuals faced death for spreading their views . 
  oftentimes they did n't even mind that . 
  these were the heroes . 
  today 's great individuals are not so lucky as our technology allows the governments to prevent any alarming new ideas from spreading in the first place . 
  damn you , balkans . 
  a diplomatic way of putting it . 
  if you want to spend your retirement years there , then you 're in for a lavish lifestyle , that 's for certain !, 
  you 'd be even better off in ukraine , but i suppose it 's a bit less safe than somewhere in the eu . 
  most polish people do n't have any savings . 
  about 7 % of them , i think , have any savings beyond the 3-month safety margin . 
  by comparison , in china it 's about 50 % . 
  the price of bonds does not imply the well being of a country - quite the opposite , in fact . 
  for instance , german bonds are extremely low , because it 's a no-risk investment . 
  sadly that wo n't happen . 
  those in power are obviously in a position to avoid justice . 
  the best we can do is try to change the system even a little bit to avoid getting into even bigger trouble . 
  the thing is , in the american system , voting for a third party actually helps the largest party gain votes . 
  the system they have set up converges to a two-party state . 
  to change that , something really big would have to happen . 
  a giant , 70 % majority new party would have to be elected for the sole purpose of changing the constitution . 
  looking at history , one might notice that such revolutions happen only after enough people do n't have enough food on their plates . 
  i have a suggestion - in the next survey you could include a question that relates to a user 's activity on / r/europe . 
  this way you could assign weights to a user 's survey data . 
  could you elaborate a bit more on that subject ? 
  i can not recall seeing him do anything out of the ordinary . 
  what disqualifies him as a mod ? 
  i wo n't repeat what other people have already posted here . 
  to me , the best thing that came out of turkey was the independent news show , [ the young turks ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/theyoungturks ) . 
  they are an example of excellent journalism . 
  i think it 's not fair to say that lithuanian forces did n't help in the battle of vienna . 
  surely they did n't take direct part in the battle itself . 
  however , after the polish forces left for battle , lithuanian units had to defend the commonwealth against hungary ( which tried to take advantage of the absence of polish troops ) . 
  if it were n't for that , who knows what would have happened . 
  what genocide do you speak of ? 
  i 'm not trying to start a flame war , i 'm just curious what are you referring to . 
  germans should n't have had straightened all these rivers throughout the last few decades . 
  they reap what they sow . 
  this only means you have met a lot of morons . 
  most of the people i know are atheists . 
  this means : 1 . 
  i have met a lot more atheist garlic bread fans than religious ones .

  do you think your government would be willing to negotiate a release of [ bouvet\u00f8ya ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tqpjx21.png ) ? 
   estonia - they think they 're better than everyone else well , are they ? 
  a danish person is called * dansk * in swedish . 
  that 's ... that 's a quarter around the globe . 
  dude , i 've had several relationships during these last fifteen years and seychelles have never even come up . 
  i travel a lot , i know what expectations are , i 'm in no hurry because i have other places to visit first . 
  just the other day i made a post of how i love this sub and all the people in it because they 're moderate and humble to each other and then you come along with this judgemental pseudopsycho babble . 
  you do not know me . 
  swedes are definitely the most humble at least / s, 
  this pisses me off to no end . 
  my time is my time , i do n't live to work , i work to live . 
  nord-norege , same thing in [ sweden ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/sverigekarta-landsdelar_norrland.svg/450px-sverigekarta-landsdelar_norrland.svg.png ) being like the 3/5 top of the country, 
  [ mrw ] ( http://img.pandawhale.com/113640-i-have-a-really-bad-feeling-ab-s9sz.gif ), 
  i do n't read newspapers ( or e-newspapers ) , i do n't watch tv or listen to radio . 
  i used to but when i stopped my quality of life got so much better . 
  the seychelles have been my dream destination for fifteen years but it 's really not somewhere i 'd go on my own or with a friends , it 's more of a * romantic * destination . 
  japan and australia is both on my bucket list and other places i want to go is backpacking through laos , cambodia , vietnam , philippines . 
  i love south east asia , bali , thailand , singapore are all fantastic . 
  my top recommendation i always hare is bali . 
  that is absolutely adorable, 
  what part of norway is considered * east norway * ? 
  is it the part close to finland ? 
  ( do n't you dare answer * sweden * ), 
  frick on stick that 's some finnish lengthening of words right there, 
  i 've come across many anglospherian citizens who works in sweden . 
  just now this week it was an australian guy at a marketing firm in gothenburg . 
  there are jobs , especially in the engineering field but i 'm sure that the countries that are very proficient in english as a second language ( netherlands , denmark , finland , sweden ) it 's not seen as a hindrance and maybe even a merit since your input as a native english speaker can help . 
  countries where english is n't * as * good might not be interested, 
  absolutely golden , especially the first mod repsonse !, 
  educate [ yourself ] ( https://youtu.be/bgotrmkrjo4 ), 
  numbers from 2012 say that 11 % of swedes smoke and 10,5 % snus . 
  anja < 3, 
  too kind a name in english if you ask me . 
  in swedish it 's something like hag-haul, 
  ** ice hockey ** obviously finland ** cross country skiing ** norway ** beer drinking ** danes, 
  that 's like * that * friend you had growing up playing boardgames but because it was his boardgame he could change the rules of it to suit him or everybody could go home . 
  yeah we all know * that * friend, 
  love that sibling bantery :d, 
  they 're in german . 
  please summarize them for the rest of us . 
  relevant username, 
  a week ago i booked a flight to bali . 
  sabaton is one of the two bands i would care enough to see live . 
  they 're on tour now.doing two weeks in sweden . 
  exactly the dates i 'm going to south east asia . 
  fml, 
  sounds like a title to grey boring romantic drama, 
  * only 32 % * . 
  sounds awfully high to me . 
  it must be highly subjective . 
  i can assume it feels like all french smoke when it 's three times as high as here . 
  i just meant that you found it excessive with that many spreads to choose from but having so much cheese to pick from is n't excessive . 
  growing up in malm\u00f6 , sk\u00e5ne i did n't meet anyone that did n't hate on stockholm until late in my teens . 
  it was just the default . 
  in sweden the road is sm\u00f6rg\u00e5s which translates to butter-goose . 
  we mostly eat open faced * sm\u00f6rg\u00e5s * like [ this ] ( http://www.bildshop.nu/productimages/vm-grov-sm\u00f6rg\u00e5s-m-ost-dsc00.jpg ) is a typical breakfast * sm\u00f6rg\u00e5s *, 
  here in sweden these kinds of markets easily have meters upon metres of different kinds of cheese . 
  i can imagine it being the same way in nl ? 
  same user that posted [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5yljux/do_you_think_germans_are_sincere_in_their/ ) so i guess op has something against germans, 
  they hide it when they all sing at the same time but as soon as they sing one at a time it 's like claws on a chalkboard . 
  i 'm more surprised that they were the one winning the macedonian competition, 
  maybe you can shed some light on this , i 've heard that danes have it easier understanding rikssvenska than sk\u00e5nska . 
  i 'm from sk\u00e5ne ( and even worked in k\u00f6benhavn at times ) and i rarely understand danish, 
  oh i did n't mean that she was made up , i just made a point that the numbering did n't seem to really be important enough to be correct . 
  and apparently a few made up ones, 
   ( actually she should be margrethe i , because the real margrethe i was n't queen ) what the ... 
  i had to read up on regal numbering and came across this * sometimes legendary or fictional persons are included . 
  for example , the swedish kings eric xiv ( reigned 1560 -- 68 ) and charles ix ( 1604 -- 11 ) took ordinals based on a fanciful 1544 history by johannes magnus , which invented six kings of each name before those accepted by later historians . 
  * i guess it 's not that important then , let 's just hurrdurr something, 
   we had a german king . 
  i did n't know that . 
  that 's fascinating . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_finland_ ( 1918 ), 
  i know that a lot of swedes want to give back sk\u00e5ne to denmark if that counts . 
  at least they 'll be an invasion deterrent . 
  wo n't be blitzing with those hogging all the roads, 
  thank you for this !, 
  i still remember [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/dwlrcgh-1nu ), 
  wait what !, 
  did you switch design on currency with only 12 years apart ? 
  i apparently got the spelling wrong , it 's solstollarna . 
  it was a little bit weird looking back at it because international stars like samantha fox and mandy smith were both guests on the show . 
  the name of the show was ~ ~ solst\u00e5llarna ~ ~ solstollarna . 
  the and it 's the blonde mermaid that is the one exposed, 
  it was n't a big thing . 
  there was even slight nudity in children 's show in the 80s . 
  l\u00e5t den r\u00e4tte komma in ( eng title : let the right one in ) set in a suburb in the 1980s about a boy and girl . 
  amazing photography s\u00e4llskapsresan ( eng title : the charter trip ) swedish classic about a couple of swedes going to malorca on a charter trip . 
  yes !, 
  i remember seeing this in the 80s when public tv showed it . 
  i was only eight or nine at the time but the end really messed me up . 
  paranoia grew in me . 
  saw it again about ten years ago , now i noticed there was a lot of nudity , did n't really acknowledge that first time around, 
  funny , i would n't bat an eye if cousins were married but i 'm thinking the view on this might be because how close you are to your cousins growing up . 
  my cousins lived 400km away and only met them twice a year . 
  we were all the same age though, 
  student ? 
  gothenburg city net , bahnhof service provider 25 $ for 100/100mbit fiber all the way into my apartment . 
  i get that speed and during the four years i lived here it has only gone down once and it was because of a faulty fan in the station . 
  45000 customers went down for an hour or so .

  i do n't say it makes sense but i heard lots of arguments like that . 
  if its in the public domain its the publisher just like if you print books written by charles dickens ( no his decendents doesnt get rolyalty ), 
  considering its a bestseller in the middle east i 'm not suprised . 
   i believe the objection to printing and selling it is less based on its magical powers and more on the thought that it would be something of poor taste to see big stacks of ` mein kampf ' stacked in bookstores , next to the latest dan brown . 
  even israel does n't make it illegal to sell mein kampf . 
  i actually read it because well everyone seems to have an opinion about it without actually having read the book ( which is usually a bad sign ) . 
  i was suprised on how little anti-semetism it contains ( do n't get me wrong . 
  there is lots of it there but from other peoples descriptions i thought every sentence would be filled with anti-semetism ) and the fact that he seems to write more about how much he hates the slavs . 
  i thought he actually had some interesting observations . 
  especially on group behaviour and how populist politics should be conducted for maximum effect . 
  clearly his proposed solutions/politics were evil and terrible but not everything in the book is about that . 
  he also writes lots about how groups work , about history etc. 
  there is no denying that he was pretty smart when it comes to convincing people and one can see some similarities with europe today . 
   not getting any benefits in germany my point all along . 
  as long as you give them high benefits they will come . 
  if you stop they will not come . 
  although i think most of them would prefer turkey rather than poland if they could n't get to one of the rich welfare states . 
  i doubt your plan till work . 
  you can not just put them on german trains and ship them to poland . 
  they do n't want to go there . 
  they want the higher benefits in germany . 
   and integrating a few million refugees ( luckily for us most people from syria and iraq are still there ) should n't be too much of an issue for europe in its entirety . 
  but the problems is that they do n't wan na spread out evenly . 
  they do n't wan na go to romania instead of germany . 
   it 's also not really fair to say that comparably generous benefits in germany or sweden are the reason for migration into europe . 
  of course it is . 
  do you really think they are coming for the weather ? 
  if i was a refugee and i got to choose between going to germany and cash in alot of benefits or poland and get none i would of course choose germany . 
  to say that these people do n't try to maximise their own standard of living is silly . 
   and integrating a few million refugees ( luckily for us most people from syria and iraq are still there ) should n't be too much of an issue for europe in its entirety . 
  yea , but they are n't going to go to romania , portugal and poland . 
  they will mostly end up in germany and sweden because that is where they will recieve more welfare ( if you do n't believe these to be the case check how many goes to germany and how many goes to poland )  tens of millions of people have illegally entered the usa even though they hardly receive any benefits there . 
  1 ) many come for labour 2 ) they do recieve benefits that are way higher than in for example mexico . 
   i do n't think so . 
  i do n't have the time to look up the ecj ruling in full text , but as far as i understood the articles about it , people who have worked for some years in another eu country have the same welfare rights as citizens . \u00a8 people from syria and afganistan is n't eu citizens and eu law does n't apply . 
   nope . 
  that ruling was based on parts in our constitution that are n't changeable . 
  it 's legally possible and reasonable to give asylum seekers food , clothing etc. 
  instead of cash , but the sum may not substantially differ from what germans would get . 
  alright , then i guess germany will always continue to be the number 1 destitination of refugees . 
  there are 40 million people in the middle east that has the right to asylum and says they want to come to western europe if they could . 
  do you think germany could take in 40 million refugees and pay them all welfare ? 
   anyone who 's a resident however is entitled to welfare yes , but any country could easily change the laws . 
   on the other hand , there 's still no country in europe that has stopped providing shelter for asylum seekers , so i guess it has to be mandatory . 
  it 's not mandatory . 
  they have the right to live here as long as the conflict is going on . 
  the host country has no obligation to give welfare to non-citizens and they have no obligation to give them citizenship . 
  most countries currently gives welfare to refugees and germany and sweden has the highest benefits ( hence why everyone tries to get to germany or sweden instead of slovakia or some other country ) . 
  i do n't know about germany but sweden could just change its law overnight to exclude them from welfare ( or just give them a very low welfare becuase it might not be a good idea to have a lot of angry young men from afganistan on the streets hungry ) . 
  if they changed the law so that they only get minimum welfare and will be sent back as soon as the conflict is over alot less ppl would try to get to sweden . 
  i 'm pretty sure that germany are n't legally obligated according to their constitutional law to give alot of welfare to non-citizens . 
  they could probably also change their laws . 
  i guess in the sense of letting these people in . 
  hardly because of integration though . 
  pretty sure isis members are n't going to stop committing terrorism just because they get another job program from the goverment . 
   discrimination based on heritage is forbidden , hence the only way to abolish it for refugees is to abolish it for you citizens as well . 
  in what country is forbidden constitutionally to give less welfare to non-citizens ? 
  in sweden eu migrants do n't get any welfare and its not unconstututionally . 
  they have the legal right to apply for asylum : meaning they can live in the country until there is no danger anymore at which point they can be sent back . 
  just change the welfare laws so that non-citizen are n't entitled to welfare and restrict citizenship to only those who actually become productive members of society and send the rest back as soon as the dangers are gone . 
  that would make it alot less attractive to come to nothern europe . 
  there is a reason they do n't wan na stay in hungary , bulgary , etc even though there are no wars there : the benefits are higher in sweden and germany ( heck if i was a refugee i would also prefer sweden or germany because i would get more benefits ) . 
  yeah ... sure ... it 's europes fault these people committed terror attacks in the name of islam ... if only we had more integration programs they would n't do it ... 
  false . 
  there is nothing that says they are legally obliged to open the borders . 
  it only refugees on european soil that have a right to apply for asylum . 
  also no treaties guarantees they should have the right to welfare . 
  cut 100 % of the welfare for reguees and most would rather stay in turkey . 
  the person that came up with this idea should be promoted . 
  yea , the socialist goverment in sweden would probably love it . 
  but it wo n't work . 
  you ca n't just put them on a train and ship them to poland . 
   they 'd be just fingerprinted and shipped to poland i 'm sorry but that sound horrible to suggest that you take unwanted people in germany , mark them and then `` ship '' them to poland ... sounds like something else ... 
  no , they ca n't . 
  they ca n't discriminate against other eu citizens . 
   it 's like they 're actively trying to drown and want to pull as many people with them as possible . 
  i think that is a cristal clear analysis of swedish politics . 
   tax payers and children of tax payers will . 
  true . 
  the politicans will still get their cash . 
   if they come over to us , they will want to leave and go to sweden or germany exactly . 
  they do n't come to sweden because every other eu country is hostile . 
  they come here because we give them more money than anyone else . 
  i remember this case . 
  exactly . 
  that is especially true when it comes to educated people who actually understands that taking in 500 000 ppl on a yearly basis ( from the finance minister yesterday ) will create problems . 
  they know that yet they choose to ignore it to give the impression that they are a good person . 
  because they say what sells best . 
  and being politically correct sells more because no one is offended . 
  but why is he just standing next to the guy ? 
  i know :( i tried many times . 
  often just ended in pain . 
  a player from the opposite team ? 
  hey guys we have a nerd here . 
  lets get him !!, 
  that 's why i wan na learn how that game works . 
  it seems like there is actually more strategy there than in other sports . 
  what ? 
  they are living my childhood dream !, 
  is this like br\u00e4nnboll but with running zig-zag and having a teammate throw the ball for you ( why ?!,

  best analogy i can give you , with out surgery or something . 
  it 's the original reasoning behind it , but it has indeed evolved . 
  for a while it was looked on as a anti-mastrubation device , wich kind of worked back in the day before lube . 
  now i belive they claim its hiv-protective and cleaner . 
  to remove a functioning body part of your children to appease your invisible skyfriend is rather odd when you think about it . 
  this got me curious about how large the other european subreddits are .

  that my friends , that takes character . 
  in some languages * on * and * for * are very similiar . 
  so i understand the confusion . 
  yes it is !, 
  1905 never happened !, 
  return to your master !, 
  back when we had conscription ( 2010 ) ; if you were a pacifist , you still had to do your military service . 
  they just put you in a non-combat training , so you had to peal potatoes and stuff . 
  in the regards to sweden where just about every other party has gotten closer and closer to the middle ( maybe not so much v\u00e4nsterpartiet & kristdemokraterna ) . 
  id say that votes for the far right is more of a no vote on the current view of the system than a vote actually for the policies of the far right . 
  i felt that i needed to xpost it here . 
  because the title hit home , it 's true . 
  i had never heard about this . 
  in school or on tv . 
  [ wikipedia link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flight_and_expulsion_of_germans_\\ ( 1944 % e2 % 80 % 931950 \\ ) ) about it for those who trust wikipedia more . 
  well they did succeed in poland . 
  iirc : she 's straight edge . 
  healthcare and meatballs for all !, 
  first time they 're counting votes in azerbaijan . 
  would love to see jedward when they 're in their 50s and all they have left to live for is the eurovision song the do once per year . 
  suprisingly so , good on you ireland . 
  the honorable shiny spandex knights of ireland !, 
  give it to switzerland , they 're neutral !, 
  afaik its not raised to 67 per say . 
  you can still retire at 65 , but you have the right to work to 67 if you so choose . 
  thats the american version of cnn . 
  not cnn international . 
  wich we get stuck with here in europe . 
  what also annoys me about cnn , is that they 're still broadcastin in 4:3 . 
  im gon na sell the eu financeministers some magic beans ... 
  congratulationswelldone, 
  i 'd like to add * views on greek bailout * views on future eu expansion * views on eu in general * views on imigration ( from other european countries , and non european countries ) * do you watch the eurovision song contest, 
  some of our fellow countrymen do tho . 
  [ relevant satw ] ( http://satwcomic.com/new-nordic ), 
  welcome to the club !, 
  and most importantly , what did you eat ? 
  there 's always been a strong nordic unity . 
  even before schengen we had pass-free inter-nordic travel . 
  there is a sort of trust among us . 
  so i can see why this would seem like a good idea . 
  sad day for the french . 
  swede here , 62 % if you make 53k euros / year . 
  last time i checked ( 2008 ) the top tax rate was about 85 % back in the late 70 's . 
  i was thinking more of eu-wide implementation of full body scanners . 
  fair point though . 
  this could have terrifying implications . 
  why would you standardize something if you dont intend on implementing it ? 
  in order for europe to be able to tackle this increasing rise in religon . 
  we need to be more aware that every religion is just an idea . 
  an idea a few people hold very dear to their heart , but its nothing more than an idea , and its absoutley essential that we , as an open society , are able to discuss the merits within these ideas . 
  wether its , islam , judaism , christianity , communism or capitalism . 
  i strive for as localy produced as possible ( for a reasonable price ) which usually have me buying swedish products . 
  i kind of stay away from anything out of european tho i have to admit that . 
  except the occasional sweet from foregin countries , just to try it . 
  actully thats not the free market . 
  during the nixon administration the us goverment realized that it would be cheeper to produce a lot of just one crop . 
  they settled on corn . 
  cause its versitile . 
  subsidesd it heavily . 
  america ended up overproducing corn , the us goverment buys any corn that doesnt get sold on the open market . 
  so now they feed their cattle with corn . 
  they allso invented a way to make a sweet liquid out of corn using acids . 
  this is what the sweetner in american coke . 
  americans are aware of this and some disaprove . 
  `` mexican coke '' is selling in certin places around the us . 
  as mexico still uses suger . 
  ( sorry i co-run a soda blogg so i know trivia like this ), 
  i 'm sure they 're aware that they suck already . 
  i have to admit that i 've got mixed emotions about this . 
  on the one side im glad , if not thrilled that europe finaly is getting its own , independant from the us , navigation system . 
  thats not made for the military and adopted for public use . 
  this is great . 
  on the other hand it essentialy not needed , as there 's allready gps . 
  it doesnt fill a new use and just servers to further clutter the near earth debris . 
  mixed emotions as you can tell , still , a great day for europe . 
  the question is , would the join ? 
  are n't they too neutral ? 
  laptop & latte generation . 
  gon na start using that term now . 
  hits suprisingly close to home . 
  thats a very nice flag you have there , i like how it compliments my flag . 
  subreddit improvements are always welcome . 
  well done . 
  [ a lot of things ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/november_9 ) happend on this day in history . 
  perhaps most notably : [ napoleons coup d'\u00e9tat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18_brumaire ) in 1799 [ night of broken glass ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kristallnacht ) / kristallnacht in 1938 and [ the fall of the berlin wall ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_wall#demolition ) in 1989 the 9th of november has truly been an eventfull day for europe through history . 
  and so did you !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ( ( probably ) ^ ), 
  good ol' european sunday news roundup thread !, 
  please state your country when you reply , especially if you have weird flair . 
  ** remember : ** please state your country when you reply , especially if you have weird flair . 
  ^ ( i 'm talking to you secessionist ! ), 
  ** remember : ** please state your country when you reply , especially if you have weird flair .

because if someone is n't converted they 're a jew if their mother is , therefore you can argue that judaism is an ethnicity . 
  well the philosophy goes along the lines that if people understand what they hear they might relate better in songs . 
  cold war , considering your flair you are hungarian which used to be a satellite state . 
  during this era there was the west ( nato ) against the warsaw pact in the east . 
  if they think very conservatively they might still see you are their enemies !, 
  afaik , it 's been stated that they 'll have more english in the song so that rest can understand ( it fucking sucks that italy does like this , their grande amore was the greatest thing ever and so were their last entry until they did the english edition . ), 
  also it needs to shorter ( 3 minutes ) for it to be played at eurovision , so they have to cut 37 seconds out of the track . 
  it 's a tribute to the book `` the naked ape '' , which is a big inspiration for this song . 
  in which has context about the evolution and how homo sapiens evolved in a different form from the gorillan ancestors and therefore we have different behavior and evolutionary threats , such as evolving bigger penises and the sexual selection . 
  the [ italian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-onrxfhbhb4 ) song is a fucking masterpiece , it 's lyric is a satire about how the western world try to understand eastern culture with westernized twist . 
  it also features how bizarre the western world really with intelligence being out of fashion here and how the only things we do is taking selfies and buying chanel . 
  just like we do with the younger generation of students in pe events shall we ? 
  everyone 's a winner do matter what , am i right ? 
  fucking hell mate , kids needs to learn how to lose , which no one seems to have figured out . 
  i just realized that when i dug deeper into the ideology 's which mp and s ran, 
  wow , our government is pathetic . 
  it 's just a coincident that no women were winners . 
  you have to consider how many people do n't get the nobel prize , but alright veronica consider it as a patriotic thing . 
  wow , really did n't realize that . 
  just saw the title and though , hey , f !, 
  can claim themselves to be a feminist government because `` we got 3 % of the votes '' . 
  that 's just embarrassing , and why are they even trying to make such a big deal out off being the first `` feminist government '' anyway ? 
  ~ ~ they are n't even in the swedish parlament , the only thing they have going for them are a single seat in the european parlament . 
  they are n't really representing our government and their debates are horrible , i 'm surprised they even got 3,12 % of the votes . ~ ~ edit : apparently this is our government ladies and gentlemen , i forgot how feminist s and mp are . 
  yeah , for that reasoning , i hate to write on the phone ... 
  the controversial part is that the source is of israeli origin . 
  and can therefore easily have favored israel in the situation . 
  patriarchy is a think to take into consideration when looking at news . 
  albeit , the incident is still very newsworthy and horrific , it should still be taken with a small grain of salt to maybe having patriotism . 
  i would presume to disguise their identity , so that they would be able to walk or kill on guarded soil without being caught . 
  sure , like i stated , it was a political decision . 
  i would also add in the unfairness towards italy during the versailles agreement . 
   wut we never liked hitler . 
   it did not prevent your country from being hitler 's ally though . 
  because the opinion of the people does n't have to mimic the political one . 
  especially an autocracy like italy during the fascism regime . 
  it 's also very strategic to side with germany because of their offer of military and technology . 
  that 's like saying `` if i throw up a ball into the air , then it 'll be in china in some hours . '', 
  fuck me , it 's simple gravity !, 
  how about that analogy instead ? 
  it 's the meme-pool , where the cultural values fight for natural selection . 
  turkey themselves decided that religious values , as in islam , is greater than secular . 
  it 's really sad when you come to think about it . 
  turkey used to be one of the most progressive and secular country in the middle east . 
  would you risk it when in the current state everything is fine and you can import cheap goods from the largest growing economy in the world ? 
  nothing internationally would have happened , with or without the recognition of taiwan . 
  but on the flip side it could spell hostility towards the taiwanese from the chinese front . 
  which is why you do n't apply logic to stereotypical national jokes ... 
  that 's the suicidal temperature for us swedes ... and you call it cold ? 
   why would you want sharia laws to not be objective ? 
  i never stated my opinions on the matter . 
   but they are still very objective . 
  no they 're not . 
  yes , most of it covers the same thing but there are still differences . 
  if they were objective they would all be the same . 
  which is n't the case . 
   women shall wear a burqa looks rather objective to me . 
  neither the quran or the sunnah forces anyone . 
  there are passages proposing that women shall wear clothes which are n't revealing ( same for men ) , but nowhere does it state anything to the regard of force . 
   there is only one sharia law , but there are many interpretations therefore it 's not objective . 
  it exists in many different forms . 
  even though the sources are the same , as in the sunnah and the quran , there are different scholars reading these are creating laws based on them . 
   anyway sharia law has nothing to do with climate change . 
  of course not . 
  but you 've commented that isis does n't deny climate changes where the context is about the homologi study of dup and sharia laws . 
  sharia laws are n't objective . 
  countries have different sharia laws . 
  although for the fenoscandinavian and german principalities they were ruled under larger kingdoms . 
  for the fenoscandinavians it was the kalmarunion while the german were the holy roman empire . 
  this map only shows the sovereignty of these principalities but not the union they had over their principalities . 
  yes lenin if anyone just wanted to fill the empty space which marx left open in his communistic manifest . 
  he even warned to not put stalin in charge of the union in fear of a downward spiral . 
  in all honesty , can we even state if * anyone * is a true marxist ? 
  i mean , if anything karl marx himself did a rather poor job of not coming up with every conclusion for the premise of the capitalistic view . 
  if anything , what is the right condition to even start a communist revolution ? 
  the resources need to be national and if anything it 's not really rational for the country 's economy most of the time . 
  if anything i want to see a rationalized modern version of the communist manifest , because it for sure can provide a good cause if it 's written with stable conclusions . 
  well it 's kinda hard in actually to predict potential interactions . 
  although i would highly doubt that marx would criticize the communism which soviet leaders ( at least the first big 3 ) , i would still regardless enjoy to see that someone actually went with his ideologi to an success . 
  optimism aside i could see him being enraged over the russian revolution , since lenin and stalin alone badmouthed any communistic future . 
  no one really dares to propose any communistic view due to prejudice . 
  although the sect of socialism has risen in many parts of the worlds , especially democratic socialism . 
  while communism run china have faded away from many aspects in the economic sector . 
  meanwhile both cuba and north korea have an unclear future for the fate of communism and authoritarianism . 
  because people associate communistic revolutions with the conclusion of a marxist leader . 
  when in actuality it has never been the case . 
  both stalinism and leninism has gone away from the radical view which marxism propose . 
  if anything i would consider titoism as the closest anyone has come to being communism . 
  although , it in itself was n't true marxism . 
  no denial that every aspect off the communism states were against individualism and for the communistic market it 's still just an aspect out of many . 
  or you know , it 's a coincident ? 
  green in islamic culture represent jannah ( paradise ) and was widely used for royalty during the fatimid caliphate . 
  not only that but it got the association with arabic nationalism during the arab revolts as a way to show independence from the turks . 
  and has since been used in arabic ( or at least muslim ) countries together with the other pan-arabic colors . 
  for the polish fascism flag i got no clue sadly . 
  but it seems to be the only fascist flag to future anything ordinary and not any nationalistic aspects . 
  all in all , it 's been a movement which has existed since 1929 , known as the national radical camp or onr as in the polish version . 
  are mine the only ones who did n't say so ? 
  they say that you can use it for some knowledge on the subject and then use sources on the site . 
  because wikipedia is n't a firsthand source .

  and as for caricature of your character - i do not need to . 
  you do it so naturally , all by yourself in the way you never fail to make everything about greek , and how the rest of the world should adjust to your needs . 
  frankly , i could n't come up with the stuff if i tried . 
   'm not going to reply to your crazy rant about your supposed cultural superiority i am not superior against your culture , just against you . 
  we have however , established that a long time ago and frankly , it is not to difficult . 
  your arguments is `` blablabla , trojkas fault '' . 
   if you read the article and all you understood was `` damn crazies want to break the rules again i did n't even respond with regards to the greeks , if you had read my answer . 
  you have never bothered ever to follow them , so nothing new there . 
  the new information was provided by you , that again , you blamed the rest of the world for something the greeek goverment did . 
  as in `` we have to follow it even less becaue the troijka ( !!, 
  ! which is not the maastricht countries , but then again , you are very illogical ) said something and my government was then undemocratic . 
  thus , we have free reigns of not follow it . 
  `` i think that is your `` logic '' but then again , greece have never bothered to follow it anyway , so i guess that was just number of 2352 of the times you have pissed on the treaty . 
  but , a new take was perhaps blaming the maastrich countries , usually it is the troijka you blame . 
   your comments reek with superiority complex . 
  get over yourself . 
  said the person who questioned if i had even read it . 
  you know i had . 
  just just want to be stupid . 
  i do n't need to get over myself . 
  it is you that have to take a deep look at yourself and stop blaming everyone else for what is happening in greece . 
  if it is n't the troijka destroying greece , then it is apparently the 25 maastricht countries who are responsible for the undemocratic behaviour of the government.that is the sum of your arguments . 
  and , as usual from you , no evidence . 
  it is sad , the more i argue with you the more i understand why things are going the way the are going in greece.if all do like you do ( which i do n't really think , and hope not ) in the sense that you are constantly blaming others , and disregarding other people 's democratic rights , and the law , that is what you want to do . 
  of course that will lead to problems . 
  i just wished you would understand ( and i am an eternal optimist , perhaps even you can understand it at some point ) that it is your doing , not our . 
  and , as long as it is my democratic rights you feel like trample on , you can bet that i will argue with you until there 's a cold day in hell . 
  so , fuck up your country . 
  not mine . 
   so , the government bypassing the parliament to pass `` structural reforms '' now is justified because greece did n't care about the maastricht treaty in the past ? 
  that is * your * government , and * you * should deal with it . 
  have the 25 maastricht countries specifically told you to `` give up democracy '' ( and do not confuse with the troijka ) . 
  i know the swedish government has n't . 
  and , even if they * had * , which they have not , then your democratic government could of course say , `` no , that is not democratic , let us not do that ... '' the fact that the greek government * chooses * to do it this way have nothing to do with the maastricht treaty , but it is typical that you blame it one something else . 
  if you do n't like your government , here 's a hint - re-election , demonstrations or do n't choose them in the first place . 
  i do n't blame my governments failings on the bloody maastricht treaty , nor do i think it is a reason to treat the other 25 countries undemocratically and put myself in the center . 
  i might not like it , not reason not to follow it . 
  is that how you think it should be done ? 
  if you do n't like a law and a treaty , just ignore it ? 
  no negotiation , no cooperation , no discussion - just `` fuck it '' . 
  no wonder you are in deep shit then . 
   hello ? 
  planet earth to igelkotten . 
  you 're not making any sense . 
  but you do who thinks that the bad behaviour of the greek government is the reason that we should override demcracy and just toss treaties out the windows if it does n't suit the greeks is ? 
  earth to naurgul . 
  the failings of greece , or the greek government is not the fault of the 25 other maastricht countries , also , if the greek government behave undemocratic , it is because they are , not because there is a treaty in brussels ... ... and , last but not least . 
  it gives you no reason , none whatsoever , to ignore democracy . 
  you have given no argument whatsoever why greek could n't go the democratic route . 
  either withdraw from the treaty , or * argue that is bad and renegotiate it * . 
  a lot of other countries might agree , but you have given no reason why * my * democratic rights should be overriden . 
  it is my right to be a part of a new treaty . 
  it is important to me . 
  it is also my right to be a part of the discussion when/if it should be dissolved . 
  you ignore that right . 
  you steal that right . 
  why should my rights , or the rights of poles or finns be overridden ? 
  why not go down the democratic route ? 
   have you even read the article ? 
  are you aware what the article means when it says the `` maastricht orthodoxy '' ? 
  or are you here just to deride me for the country i was born in ? 
  yes i have , and yes you know i know what they mean , and yes , you know that too so now you are just being silly . 
  and i am deriding you and your country because you seem to think that you and your country have the right to override the democratic process for all the other 25 countries . 
  i think you are stupid who blames the other 25 countries because of your government failings , and because you think you have the right to remove my rights to a fair and balanced process when we right a new maastricht treaty . 
  if you respected any other country and its inhabitants , you would say that of course greece have no right to remove that process and i might also point out that it has been extrememly disrespectful of greece not to follow the treaty . 
  it say a lot of how you choose to ignore the law and the treaty.not that you are alone in that respect , but you are the only one dense enough arguing that you have right to disrespect us . 
  or are you so ignorant that you do not understand that continously breaking a treaty is disrespectful ? 
  if you want to be treated with respect , perhaps one should stop doing stuff like that . 
  but it does n't seem like fun , more like heckling . 
  maybe the dutch have a different sense of humour . 
   that 's completely unrelated to what i was saying ? 
  greece following the maastricht treaty prior to the crisis has nothing to do with whether democratic procedures were overriden to force it to comply after the onset of the crisis . 
  no it is n't . 
  you just ca n't start complaining about one of your instituitions not being able to follow it the way you want when democracy and following the treaty meant nothing to you the 10 years before . 
  you do n't have any arguments , nor do you have any rights to override and ignore the maastricht treaty . 
  you have always had the right , just like everyone else , to withdraw or to discuss the treaty and its conditions . 
  that is good democracy to discuss , to put things to vote , and i think it might be vitalising . 
  to say that you have the right to override it - well , why do n't you leave then ? 
  you have never bothered to follow it anyway . 
  and , you have no right to trample on my rights , which in fact you have every time you ignored it . 
  we worked to follow it to the letter - why have n't you ? 
   for a specific example relevant to the `` maastrichtorthodoxy '' , consider all the democratic institutions of the debtor countries that have beenoverridden so that the eurozone intergovernmental crisis-management decisions could be implementented . 
  what ? 
  i have no idea what you are talking about , but i do know that greece have n't bothered to follow the maastrich treaty one single day , so blaming the maastricht treaty for that , is rather super silly.i want scientific evidence that greece never ever had any options but not to ignore the treaty from the beginning . 
  furthermore , if you take the right ( which you have already done btw ) in your hands just to ignore and override it because it suits you - well , you are overriding my democratic rights . 
  and , who in god 's name gave you the authority to do that , and do even more damage than greece have already done . 
  we have signed the treaty too you know , and have followed , almost to the letter . 
  why have n't greece bothered , and do you really think that gives you the right to ignore it even more ? 
  countries who just do not follow it , dont ' engage in discussions , do n't want to vote - they are the ones hurting it . 
  not the countries who do . 
  to say , that because a ) you choose not to follow it and b ) your economy was so fucked up that you then could n't c ) then there was no option but to bail you out which also ruinied the treaty and from there draw some bizarre conclusion that you have the right to overrun the rights of 25 ( !!! ), 
  other states , it so undemocratic , and illusions of grandeur , that i am baffled . 
  no , the maastricht treaty have not been followed to the letter . 
  greece is one of the worst culprit of that , from day one . 
  to ignore that , and later put the blame on the troijka for greece not following the treaty , is one of the worst spin of reality i have ever read . 
  in addition to that , trying to use that as an excuse to overrride the democratic rights of 25 other countries and say that `` we do not have to discuss this , because the troijka was mean '' is baffling . 
  in fact , every single detail of your argument just strengthens mine . 
  if that is how greeks think , i think the maastricht countries should watch and guard the treaty with their life . 
  in principle i am all for changing it after votes in 26 countries , after discussions etc , but if countries think it is not valid because some of them failed so enormously ( most have n't you know ) - well , then we need to hold on to it tighter than ever . 
  if this is how some respect democracy , then the rest of us needs to fight for it .

  the `` root causes '' of migration is an increasingly open-border asylum system in europe . 
  but merkel , who runs the show , has already said she wo n't budge on the key issue . 
  and as long as she does n't budge , this is all a chimera which means ** nothing ** . 
  merkel is the obstacle to progress not these africans . 
  i actually think you 're underestimating the ideological underpinnings of this project . 
  nobody is making a killing here . 
  people want to believe these materialistic explanations because they ca n't fathom why their gov would do this against their own people . 
  neither do i , but i 've left the `` the elite benefits on this '' bs a long time ago . 
  this is ideological , not driven by money . 
   sweden will now spend money on refugees who arrive from those countries due to the poor economical and living conditions . 
  that ... does n't makes a lot of sense . 
  the total asylum budget for the next 4 years is 270 billion sek . 
  that only includes * initial * costs . 
  it does n't include the long lead times to get into the employment market ( for those who get in at all ) , the strain on social services etc. 
  to put this in perspective : sweden could fund the ** entire ** un syrian refugee budget for many times over for this sum . 
  please do n't pretend that this has * anything * to do with `` humanitarianism '' . 
  it 's an ideological project . 
  the absolvement of the swedish culture . 
  but you ca n't sell it like that . 
  so instead they use dead kids on a beach as emotional blackmail . 
  nobody does the numbers among the general public and those few who do are demonized . 
  when are people finally going to notice what is going on here ? 
  it has nothing to do with humanitarianism/saving lives at all . 
  nothing . 
  the money spent speaks far louder than all the government propaganda ( and the media lies ) in the world . 
  there used to be an old journalistic saying , maybe we should heed it : ** follow the money ** . 
  i understand your good itentions by the reality is this : this wont be fixed until all parties agree on nationalism . 
  peoples political preferences on economy , energy , social issues etc will always be too different to house under a single party . 
  to achieve this we need metapolitics more than parliamentary politics . 
  your attitude is part of the reason why sweden is such a mess now . 
  too much group think . 
  tell me , who were the * real * crazies ? 
  too many swedes are obsessed by following concensus/what the media tells them . 
  we now see the results of that mentality . 
  wonglik stop fantasizing about sweden . 
  poland will get swedish refugees in the next few decades . 
  do n't worry , it will be the sane ones like me . 
  we 'll bond by making gulasch together and squat in adidas track suits like brothers !, 
  dont talk about stuff you have no fucking clue about . 
  sweden have instituted amazingly generous benefits for refugees in recent years . 
  so much so that even the ( pragmatic ) left has started to slowly , cautiously warn about `` disincentives to work '' . 
  also typical to see the anti-ee patronising tone so common among white lefties . 
  go fuck yourself . 
  yeah those are just the three biggest cities in sweden and whose urban metro population together account for 40 % of the country . 
  nothing to see here , move along . 
  seriously , the amount of self-denial that exists in sweden is off-the-charts huge . 
  as for your white flight tactic , do n't be a whimp . 
  do you love your country or not ? 
  if you are not willing to fight for it , you do n't deserve it . 
  you know sweden could fund the entire un budget for syrian refugees for the amount of money we will spend on just a fraction here at home . 
  it 's time to finally retire the laughable propaganda that asylum immigration has anything to do with `` human rights '' . 
  as for being pro-gay rights etc , i 'm on board on that . 
  but the term `` human rights '' today has become so bloated . 
  the guy 's been saying the same thing for years . 
  has n't stopped the catalan nationalists . 
  i mean , what is he going to do ? 
  send the army ? 
  people have to remember the history here , how the fascist dictator franco brutalised catalonia . 
  it 's even in the lore of f.c. 
  barcelona , how he went into the dressing room and threatened the barca players because they were winning against his beloved real madrid . 
  i think it was in 1944 , but i 'd welcome any corrections if my historical memory needs to be updated . 
  i 'm a federalist and i am naturally inclined against secessionism , but europe 's political system is overwhelmingly democratic and if the catalans * really * want to go at it alone , go ahead . 
  i do n't see how monaco not being part of france is a disaster or luxembourg going at it alone is a problem . 
  it 's not enough to reject his application . 
  they should deport him , too . 
  why allow a dangerous person like that to even roam the country ? 
  i 'm sure israel does n't want him , but [ that 's too bad ] ( http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/1.567450 ) . 
  would n't it be a version of the eternity machine ? 
  and for some reason they hate central banking and are in love with gold . 
  isis is just the latest example . 
  oh , and check . 
  so basically , the courts and the body of european regulators will decide how to enforce the intentionally vague rules . 
  people who are acting as if this is a done deal have n't done their homework . 
  your stream does n't have english dubs . 
  right now there 's some slavic dude talking in full speed and yeah , fairly useless if there 's no english audio dub if you wan na follow the debate . 
  being central european is probably less of an allure as poland gets richer , and thus the social values of the ce are not nearly as associated with success . 
  also , i 'm not sure if you are the arbiter of being pro-central european , considering your relentless pro-islam/pro-refugee stream of [ `` contributions '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/obeystatusquo/submitted/ ) . 
  20 years from now , we 'll be discussing how to integrate central europe into eastern europe and people like you will be marginalised , as you should be . 
  stereotypes never cease to impress me . 
  now we just need one of those `` sweden loves gaysex '' comics from / r/polandball and we 're all set . 
  ( damn you the netherlands , for stealing our thunder ) . 
   my country sometimes feels like a whore you 've been whoring out to uncle sam for decades . 
  even went into iraq on his command , silly brit . 
  but china , which has no agenda to invade half the world and invite the other half into its country , is somehow off-limits ? 
  what we 're seeing now is a smart rebalancing from the uk to a more balanced foreign policy . 
  this should be celebrated . 
  if anything , the uk is turning into less of a whore ( or a slave if you want to use that analogy ) and becomming more independent , like india . 
  your mindset is weird . 
  no it 's not his point . 
  he was trying to dismiss the findings by using a shit comparison and it blew up in his face . 
  and you missed that . 
  how is it dishonest ? 
  it deals with london , not the uk . 
  just because it does n't fit your narrative ? 
  pathetic . 
   there 's a difference between saying immigrants are causing a rise in tb , which i do n't remember ever having contested and saying tb was eradicated ( i do n't think there is any country in the world that has eradicated tb ) and has been imported immigrants are imported into a country . 
  it 's not hard to understand . 
  unless , of course , you 're unwilling to accept anything badly linked to immigration , which it is obvious you are . 
  it 's also possible to have two thoughts in your head at the same time . 
  the uk could be doing a better job on tb , and immigration could contribute to the spread of tb , and both can be true at the same time .

  october 2015 : `` wtf , eastern europe , you ca n't dump migrants in germany . 
  we 're building a fence now , so take care of the migrants yourselves . '', 
  our politicians like to talk about our `` sacred '' neutrality and how no one in their right mind would attack a scandinavian country in the 21st century , but i would n't be surprised if we woke up one of these days to the news of sweden being quickly fasttracked to a full nato membership , or getting a special protective status . 
  yesterday [ dn ( article in swedish ) ] ( http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/nytt-hot-mot-sverige-holls-hemligt/ ) revealed that the 150 soldiers that were ordered to remain on gotland last week were told to do so because of an increased russian threat to the island . 
  the threat is at the moment still top secret , and a potential russian attack is now described by the swedish commander micael byd\u00e9n as `` one with low likelihood '' , rather than `` unlikely '' . 
  i 'm not especially young , but i think a decade is a fair amount of time on which to base statistics , at least when it comes to societal trends . 
  1916 : two years into wwi . 
  1966 : vietnam war , cultural revolution in china , cold war with multiple nuclear tests this year , the troubles in northern ireland . 
  ( warning , pdf ) [ economics and peace.org ] ( http://economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/global-terrorism-index-2015.pdf )  terrorist activity increased by 80 per cent in 2014 to its highest recorded level . 
  ( p 6 ) ...  more countries than ever have high levels of terrorism . 
  countries suffering from more than 500 deaths increased by 120 per cent . 
  in 2014 , 11 countries had over 500 deaths while in 2013 only five did . 
  ( p 6 ) ...  since the beginning of the 21st century , there has been a nine-fold increase in the number of deaths from terrorism , rising from 3,329 in 2000 to 32,685 in 2014 . 
  ( p 35 ) see figure 10 on page 37 . 
  [ 211 terrorist attacks carried out eu member states 2015 new europol report reveals ] ( https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/211-terrorist-attacks-carried-out-eu-member-states-2015-new-europol-report-reveals ) from the te-sat 2016 report linked on europol 's site :  the number of attacks slightly increased in 2015 compared to 2014 . 
  a total of 211 failed , foiled or completed attacks were reported by six member states , and almost half of them ( 103 ) by the uk . 
  the attacks resulted in 151 fatalities : 148 in france , two in denmark and one in greece . 
  these figures are markedly higher than those of 2014 , when four people were killed and six wounded . 
  the uk reported the highest number of terrorist attacks ( 103 ) in 2015 , followed by france ( 72 ) and spain ( 25 ) . 
  the number of attacks in france in 2015 increased for the first time , after a continuing decrease in the preceding four years . 
  this increase can be attributed to the jihadist terrorist attacks that the country had to endure , and the occurrence of seven right-wing attacks - the first that have been reported since 2010 . 
  the number of separatist attacks in france continued its downward trend from 125 in 2012 , to 50 in 2015 . 
  in spain , 18 attacks were classified as separatist and seven as left-wing . 
  ( p 10 ) ...  signifcant increase in the number of jihadist attacks , from 4 in 2014 to 17 in 2015 ( p 22 ) ...  signifcant increase in arrests for jihadist terrorism , from 395 in 2014 to 687 in 2015 ( p 22 ) my own conclusion : compared to 1916 or 1966 there are n't as many largescale wars in the world today , and the threat of nuclear annihilation is low , but in the period since social media and handheld devices became popular ( previous decade ) to today the number of terrorist attacks has increased , and 2016 seems like it will be a particularly bad year . 
  so even though our information is getting better , the number of violent incidents in the world is increasing . 
  compared to 1916 or 1966 the current year sure is peaceful , but compare it to any other year in the past decade , or since we became increasingly connected , and you 'll see there 's a spike in violent attacks in europe . 
  smartphones , twitter and live threads were n't introduced recently . 
  we 've had them for a number of years , so in my opinion we 're already past the point where we can see a growing number of violent attacks and contribute it to an increasingly volatile world , rather than the development of new technology . 
  these last couple of days have been crazy here on / r/europe with the vitriol , the accusations and the kneejerk downvoting , so it 's great to see that there 's still possible to have a decent conversation with people who do n't necessarily share one 's views . 
  you have my respect for that . 
  honestly , given the two options i wrote in the last paragraph of my post , i would have much rather preferred it if the uk had stayed in the union , despite all the issues of the past . 
  even if the brexit paves way for tighter integration we 'll still have to deal with the economic uncertainties that resumed this morning . 
  i think in the short term it 's going to be bad for everyone involved . 
  further integration , and a common fiscal union in order to keep the euro going , would be nice , but ultimately i would prefer if we kept the status quo . 
  brexit endangering the union and the benefits of it in my opinion far outweights the positive possibility of more integration between the remaining member states , at least at the moment . 
  as a half-swedish , half-bavarian catholic ( soft ) conservative eu federalist i 'm probably the last person to express what the average swede is feeling ( the other redditor posted the poll numbers ) , but this specific swede thinks brexit was a mistake , and a mistake all of us are going to be feeling for several years . 
  while an exercise in democracy , it was a poor one , as it has left half the country feeling triumphant , and the other robbed , and it was the product of two campaigns where one was based on what now appears to be several lies , and the other on poor enthusiasm as it seemed the status quo would prevail , and it essentially reduced a very complex question to a matter of immigration , which will probably continue to the uk , either from eu states through the eea , commonwealth nations , or both , and independence . 
  the last one i find ( pardon ) outright laughable , because firstly , if the referendum has shown anything , it is that member countries can leave the union if they so choose . 
  there was no shady attempt from eu or the leavers to fudge the numbers or influence the voters in a wrong way . 
  whether the uk will get a worse trade deal after the exit ... well , it is a third party now , and the eu should first and foremost look out for their own . 
  secondly , the uk has always been with one foot in the door , and it has had more privileges and opt-outs than any other member state . 
  i have nothing against british people , but i think as a member of the union , the uk has acted as a selfish bastard on many occasions . 
  here 's a quote from another redditor ( sorry , i did n't copy their name ) about the undemocratic nature of the eu :  that 's not true , and that 's the greatest lie of the leave campaign that they got everyone to believe . 
  you elect your mp of your constituency . 
  same goes for the eu , your whole country votes and its seats in the european parliament are given out to parties proportional to the vote they got . 
  each country gets a number of seats based on population . 
  this is clearly democratic . 
  the european council is made up of democratically elected heads of government of each member-state . 
  seems democratic to me . 
  many people have problems with the european commission ( the executive branch of the eu , with responsibilities similar to a pm or president ) , saying that it is n't democratically elected . 
  yes , you do n't directly vote for your european commissioner , but each state gets one . 
  the democratic country gets to nominate their commissioners , which have to be approved by the democratically elected european parliament and the president of the european commission . 
  the president of the european commission is nominated by the democratically elected european council and approved or vetoed by the democratically elected european parliament . 
  so , the european commissioners are indirectly , but democratically , appointed . 
  the president of the european commission can remove commissioners . 
  i think it 's unnecessary to demand more direct democracy , because if the elections to the ep have shown anything , it is that voter apathy has increased steadily over the years . 
  people just do n't care about these matters , and there 's not much hope they 'll read up on the important questions before an election , if they were given the chance to vote more . 
  would you want voters to elect a person because he promises diffuse things , or because he 's clearly the funniest candidate , or because he was the handsomest one of the lot ( something my grandmother has done on several occasions ) ? 
  in my opinion that 's only a recipe for disaster . 
  i 'm saying all of this as someone who has benefitted greatly from the eu . 
  the erasmus program allowed me to study abroad , where i met my wife , the schengen area allows us to visit her family whenever we want without much planning in advance , and the euro allows us to treat most of europe south of denmark as one country . 
  i can only speak for myself and maybe some other swedes , who have also benefited from erasmus and schengen , but the eu has been an extremely positive influence in my life , and it saddens me when i read how some people would want the union to completely disintegrate , just because they perceive it to be evil and undemocratic . 
  still , i 'm hoping only good will come out of this ordeal , which in my opinion would be if the british parliament decided to ignore the results of the referendum , and if they lost their privileges and opt-outs . 
  if that does n't happen i wish you all the best , and hopefully the departure of one of the more troublesome member states will usher in an era of tighter cooperation and integration on the continent . 
  i 'm just going to leave this nugget of information i borrowed from / u/cellularized :  simple old chap , the eu is undemocratic since the eu elections are n't first past the post , it 's lacking a chamber membership of which is hereditary and the president of the whole thing is n't appointed by a 90 year old german monarch who is also the head of state and church . 
  i can understand that people are scared . 
  i do n't , however , get why they are so eager to post their stories on the internet , where the largest pieces of shit congregate , and on twitter where anonymity is n't always everyone 's priority . 
  and on the internet cowards are more prone to spew their crap . 
  escalation would come from publishing these stories on social media , not from reporting a crime to the police . 
  eh , i do n't in any way or form support the brexit , but there 's some serious thathappened vibe over these posts . 
  all of this should fall under the public order act , yet none of these people called the police or media ? 
  i googled racist incidents that have happened since the referendum , but i have n't found anything . 
  should n't at least the remain side media be eager to jump on incidents like these ? 
  this is currently the juiciest meme on reddit . 
  brilliant . 
  what 's a bit terrifying is the fact that scotland might veto the brexit . 
  i support scotland in their fight for independence , but this would mean they would save the political careers of a clearly nervous boris johnson and his leavers , while further fueling the rage of the people who voted leave towards the scottish and the eu . 
  boris johnson would n't then be propelled to the post of pm with the support of content leavers , but because of the outrage and hatred of the same people . 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  but the question is how it can be stopped ? 
  with a positive pr campaign ? 
  people do n't care about the eu unless they can shit on it ( see the parliamentary elections - voter apathy has increased steadily despite the fact that the parliament has gained in power over the years ) . 
  with an european version of the english defamation law ? 
  i think this will only turn more people against what they perceive to be a greedy and evil union . 
  ultimately , it comes down to the politicians themselves . 
  they should be expected to respect the institutions they actually benefit from ( like nigel farage in the ep ) , and at the very least not blatantly lie about the eu . 
  but expecting politicians to act in a respectful manner ? 
  when hell freezes over maybe . 
  with and outsider 's view and limited knowledge of uk politics , i 'd say that after cameron declaring that he would resign and boris johnson seemingly reluctant to announce his candidacy for the post , the chances the uk wo n't leave are somewhat higher now , at least in my book . 
  it 's clear neither side actually expected leave to win . 
  it was a smart move by cameron , though . 
  he could 've stayed and been the responsible leader who initiated the withdrawal from the eu , and gone down in history as the one who messed up a lot of people 's future , but now the responsibility will be with someone else . 
  * if * the economy reacts badly in the near future , whoever steps in after cameron will be the one who plunges the uk further down into the abyss . 
  the new prime minister will have to decide if it 's better to respect what the people have decided , or to choose the safer route and keep the status quo . 
  ultimately , it will be the economy that will decide , but i think it was a smart move by cameron , because if the markets react badly , the blame will be solely with the brexiteers , probably crippling whatever political ambitions they have for uk after the referendum . 
  after yesterday 's initial tumult and after reading some of the articles where leavers regret their vote , where the leaders of the campaign have taken back some of their promises , the talk about scotland , ni and london ( lol ) wanting to secede , i 'm not so sure uk will actually follow through with leaving . 
  i think one of three things will happen : 1 . ), 
  the uk leaves . 
  my money is still on this one . 
  uk does not invoke article 50 and stays in the union , but a. ),

what on earth are you talking about ? 
  the swedish national dishes of spaghetti bolognese , texmex tacos and kebab pizza are delicious !, 
  that 's preposterous !, 
  everyone knows it is in fact the dane who does the moronic thing !, 
  unless there 's a norwegian in the mix , then it is he who is the fool . 
  yeah , saying `` excuse me '' is perfectly fine . 
  i usually do as it feels more polite than just expecting others to be perfectly aware of my subtle , non-verbal hints . 
  actually , i do n't mind small talk with strangers either - the problem is that most who do strike up conversations on the bus are nutjobs , drunks or junkies . 
  `` vogel '' - remember that those germans ca n't pronounce `` v '' correctly !, 
  but how does it last for `` hours '' ? 
  one cup ? 
  i mean , it goes cold within 10 minutes tops , and there 's so little of it , especially if you have an espresso or macchiato . 
  perhaps this is more important in colder climates . 
  no worries , i agree the coffee that 's served at standard caf\u00e9s and most workplaces typically is n't very good . 
  that 's why i grind my own beans and use a french press , or go to good caf\u00e9s . 
  still , i usually drink 2-4 cups in a pretty short time . 
  guess it depends on whether it 's a social `` fika '' , in which case we slow down a bit , or just to remain functioning at work/university . 
  what style of coffee do you drink in croatia ? 
  why ? 
  look , this was most likely done by a small group of independent protestors , who have no power to cancel any meetings whatsoever . 
  i 'm not directing this specifically at you , but some of these comments are so depressingly jaded and dull . 
  no , it probably wo n't make much of a difference , but if people get riled up by shitty homophobic laws and want to paint a zebra crossing in the colors of the rainbow , why the fuck should n't they ? 
  noone 's claiming this changes everything , it 's just a small act of disapproval . 
  germany is great . 
  i lived there for a couple of years in my teens , and since then i really appreciate it and go there to visit pretty often . 
  good food , great beer , the most fun and insane capital in europe , good public transportation , some beautiful scenery , close to everything , and so on . 
  you guys strike a good balance between fun and business . 
  for me as a swede it really feels more relaxed and laid back than my country , while everything still works like it 's supposed to ( and like i 'm used to ) . 
  but please stop dubbing movies and censoring video games ( if you still do the latter ) . 
  nah , i 've met some attractive maltese people of both genders . 
  but it did seem like every maltese person turns into a chubby , short meatball the second they turn , like , 45 . 
  especially the men . 
  it 's not a stupid question , it 's actually kind of interesting . 
  if you , as a non-native english speaker , grow up hearing more american english you 're obviously more likely to adopt an american accent . 
  same goes if a certain accent is seen as desirable or cool . 
  i 'm guessing some key factors are : * how your parents speak english ( if at all ) * if you 've been exposed to a certain accent before , e.g. 
  through traveling/living abroad * which accent is more popular among your peers * exposure to certain accents in media note that , for most people , their accent is obviously going to be an approximation of the `` actual '' accent . 
  certain key characteristics of that accent will be incorporated , without being completely accurate . 
  for example , one might consistently pronounce a the american way in words like ca n't , bath , dance and so forth . 
  it just makes more sense to be somewhat consistent . 
  once you reach a certain level of fluency it 's usually not too hard to switch between a couple of general accents at will , much like a native speaker . 
  i 've even had friends go through , say , brit pop phases and suddenly affecting a british accent . 
  on a final note , some people will never really acquire an accent that could really be called `` british '' or `` american '' ( or anything else ) - as general as those classifications are ( e.g. 
  the stereotypical eastern european bad guy accent ) . 
  i think austria has a pretty distinctive feel to it . 
  mozartkugeln , almdudler , beautiful christmas markets , krautsalat , marillenkn\u00f6dl , salt mines , sturm , sachertorte , krampus ( maybe not 100 % austrian ) ... ok , i realize i 'm mostly listing slightly touristy food and drinks , but having spent several vacations in salzburg and the surrounding area i have fantastic memories of restaurants , mountains , ski resorts , monasteries and hiking trails . 
  truly beautiful country . 
  i met a very interesting man named franz , the boyfriend of my older cousin , who would sneakily give me glasses of sturm during dinner when i was 13 or 14 . 
  he was larger than life and had a big red nose and a personality that shone through even if i understood very little of what he said . 
  if you said you liked a glass or a piece of silverware he would just put it in his bag and hand it to you later . 
  i remember seeing a mother slap her daughter hard across her face for being too loud in central salzburg , and i thought that wow , this is really a different country from my own . 
  i remember visiting my aunts friends ' lodge up in the mountains , where you drank water straight from a small alp stream that they had diverted into their garden . 
  my aunt 's husband is an austrian lawyer , and he 's told countless stories about how he would drive between villages and meet important clients , and how they would drink way too much at noon , then go drive to the next village , then drink some more , then drive to the next village and so on , until it was time to go to bed . 
  this was in the 70s , and he does n't drink and drive anymore , but back then it was the norm . 
  he smokes like there is no tomorrow and they always keep a pantry stocked with mind blowing amounts of candy . 
  during chestnut season he would always buy chestnuts and roast them for me and my friends . 
  no one really liked the chestnuts , but we liked him and ate them anyway . 
  i 'm not gon na apologize for the unnecessary wall of text , i just felt like writing about my experiences with austria and its people . 
  love it , have to go back soon , it 's been at least 15 years . 
  to be fair , americans ( outside of cities like ny ) are n't typically viewed as very fashionable either . 
  to me , that guy from the college kid meme is the quintessential young american in terms of haircut and clothing . 
  he could be belgian , too , they often have the same haircut , college style hoodies and jeans that are just a bit too baggy/loose . 
  but i do agree with you about germans . 
  people have a better sense of fashion in berlin , but otherwise there are a lot of ill-fitting dad jeans and outdoorsy , gore-tex type shoes . 
  a lot . 
  edit : just wanted to say that i love germany and germans . 
  you nail the balance between order and fun . 
  do n't worry about your jeans , they 're ok . you americans are a good bunch , too , from my more limited experience . 
  longyearbyen is obviously on there because of how far north it is . 
  oslo and stockholm are about the same latitude , but i guess it could be argued that oslo should be switched with stockholm as the latter is significantly larger and probably more well-known . 
  not really true . 
  every other bartender in gothenburg seems to be a brit these days , they usually know enough swedish to give me a `` stor stark '' , but other than that it 's easier to just switch to english . 
  when will this wave of british bar staff end ??? 
  we ca n't take any more !, 
  i do n't like adding the '' / s '' , because explaining sarcasm kind of defeats the point of it , but yeah , i was being sarcastic . 
  nooo , everyone in iceland lives within a 3 km radius and anyway they do n't have anything better to do than frolicking around chanting about their cultural homogeneity so why not just show up ? 
  i really think that light pollution in itself is a non-issue . 
  it 's bad if we 're wasting non-renewable resources , but assuming we do n't ( which is most likely an erroneous assumption but also a somewhat distinct issue ) i really prefer it if the streets where i live are well lit . 
  the night sky is beautiful for sure , but so are many other things that mostly exist outside of cities , such as forests and beaches . 
  i guess it 's a bit different here in sweden compared to more densely populated places like the ruhr district , though . 
  but surely darkness and nature should n't be too hard to find in canada !, 
  that sucks , neighbor . 
  the romanians beat us swedes by a long shot , but i pay about the same price as you do for ( very stable ) 100/100 ( possible to get it a bit cheaper , but i do n't want to have to commit as i do n't know how long i 'll live in my current apartment ) . 
  at least we/you are not australia or the us ,

  i 've never been to poland but would like to go - would you recommend any particular city or area ? 
  it 's not a crap job at all , but it does n't have the same status as being a medical doctor ( very few jobs do ) . 
  because fuck poor people of ethnic minorities , they do n't count anyway , right ? 
  what an appalling attitude . 
  how is it misleading if it literally shows the number of citizens of each country that have died in commercial aircraft crashes ? 
  it 's only data . 
  of course it does n't tell the whole story , but it 's still accurate . 
  however , it 'd be interesting to see casualties per capita as larger countries will obviously have more deaths due to pretty much any cause . 
  this is the funniest shit i 've seen this week . 
  masterfully edited . 
  i love the harmonies .

  they were two people who were picked at random . 
  their family might not want to speak about them publicly , although i 'm sure they are loved and missed . 
  so are you saying that germany is not prepared to process 800000 applications then ? 
  i seem to remember that this figure was based on 30 % coming from family reunification programs . 
  no it 's not true . 
  but it is comical . 
  you 're funny . 
  holy shit 54 downvotes . 
  you have my respect loliger . 
  it 's ok , negative karma is the real type of internet points on r/europe , 
  well , he is a human after all . 
  if we want to have any chance of bettering our societies and make them more safe , we could benefit greatly from understanding the motives of criminals . 
  where do wp imply that the general media claimed it was an islamist attack ? 
  they refer to flashback and to facebook , which they describe quite accurately . 
  and it is not an exaggeration that these sources had * immense * publicity at the time . 
  you might recall what this sub looked like during that time , with tons of people claiming that these were islamist beheadings . 
  if you had bothered to read the article itself , it would be quite clear to you that the man is described as deranged . 
  he did , after all , try to kill himself too . 
  i could n't agree more , it is so frustrating that people choose religions that they do n't even believe in to identify themselves . 
  but i guess that realistically , we are all affected heavily by religious traditions . 
  an atheist jew may still have strong jewish influences culturally speaking , just as i have christian values ingrained in me whether i like it or not . 
  the solution as you pointed out is better parenting ( and to some extent education ) , which is something i think society as a whole is tending towards . 
  i do think that multiculturalism is a strength in the sense that it presents multiple choices and a competition for the best practices . 
  i believe that all cultures have strengths and weaknesses and that we could benefit from combining the strengths of different cultures to form better societies . 
  however , all of this must be based on certain fundamental rights . 
  the fact that the rights of many girls from muslim families are denied is a disgrace and should never be accepted . 
  agreed , there is a lot of work to be done in that department . 
  i 'm personally not a fan of banning political expression as has been the trend in europe in the last decades . 
  there must be better ways to ensure open societies , and the road we go down now is a dark one that will only lead to less trust and less freedom . 
  those laws * are * up for discussion ( there are no taboos to me ) , but if we 're really going to undermine human rights we 're going into a deep shithole where majority rule wo n't mean anything anyway . 
  i would also say that on the whole , these laws enjoy immense public support . 
  i write `` on the whole '' because public support must be seen in a probability density manner , since it changes too quickly to base laws upon . 
  the qur ` an is a very special religious element , as you point out . 
  however , there is still tons of room for interpretation and moreover , many muslims `` pick and choose '' . 
  my experience is almost exclusively with shia muslims . 
  okay , then let 's put that aside . 
  it 's true that i have a certain way of defining democracy that may not be the most popular definition . 
  i do however like to point out that my definition is the legal one . 
  because it 's not one of those polar things where it either is or is not . 
  for example , representative democracy does n't even present us with the opportunity to express our views on many matters . 
  yet it also presents the opportunity for people to impose their views on others in matters where they do n't even affect them . 
  so it 's perhaps not the ideal form of democracy , but it still presents us with way more power than many alternative systems . 
  we definitely need to work to make our societies more democratic , and i 'm ready to sacrifice a lot of things for that to happen . 
  however , i 'm not ready to sacrifice human rights for it . 
  let 's take a simplistic example . 
  suppose that 9/10 people hate your t-shirt . 
  it can be argued that they are affected by your t-shirt just because it exists , so they should have a say about whether you can wear it or not . 
  but that does n't even matter to the view that `` democracy = majority rule '' , because they are the majority . 
  so they can vote your t-shirt into the trash . 
  in this particular case , slovakia has signed up on human rights treaties as well as treaties with the eu . 
  they have done so by the albeit flawed ways of representative democracy , but they have done so nonetheless . 
  now their people want to suddenly back out of those agreements . 
  they surely have the right to change their minds , but for this to work on a large scale there needs to be a process that ensures fairness ( otherwise the system will be too easy to manipulate and your vision of democracy falls over ) . 
  realistically though , do you see how this sort of behaviour would be unsustainable for a civilized society ? 
  the view that i 'm presenting you with is not some radical mumbo jumbo , allthough i assure you that the views that i personally hold on this matter * are * radical mumbo jumbo . 
  the fact is that western societies are based around personal freedoms and rights , of which having votes of equal value is just one among many . 
  yeah i 'm using only my own experience with muslims as source . 
  about 60 people who i know well of whom about 25 have expressed support for lgbt rights . 
  some of them have had those values put to the test by being confronted with gay people in the family . 
  at least 50 of these people are in favor of equal rights for women and men , while i only know of 2 ( who happen to be women ) that support the traditional muslim views . 
  they live in an islamic country . 
  i 'm only counting the people who identify themselves as muslim here , not the people who say that they do n't really care about religion . 
  although in my experience that does n't skew the ratios on views of social rights , which is why i think the premise of this discussion is flawed . 
  actually those are some of the exact causes that many muslims do support . 
  well , to answer your question more directly then , i think there are big problems with islam that legitimately need to be critisized . 
  however , we should not apply our views of islam to people that call themselves muslims automatically . 
  the brushstrokes are extremely broad in this sub and that 's why i 've got sand in my vagina . 
  the point of critisizing islam is either that ** a ) ** the people that call themselves muslims listen to us and change or ** b ) ** they become secular and simply put less emphasize on their religion in their lives . 
  for that to happen we need to actually make sense in our arguments . 
  yeah , of course i 'm biased , how could i not be . 
  it 's called being human . 
  the most infuriating thing is a person who thinks he holds objective views . 
  it 's also the most telltale sign that the person really does n't know what he 's saying . 
  it 's not simplistic . 
  it 's just very simple . 
  he also said his mum would flip her shit if he told her that he 's not a muslim , so i would say that islam does affect his life . 
  this is not a contest in who had the worst muslim upbringing . 
  just because your upbringing was worse does n't invalidate his feelings . 
  but for the record i disagree with him too . 
  it 's not a solution to just avoid conflict . 
  it 's your interpretation that stoning et.c . 
  is part of islam . 
  many muslims do not feel that way . 
  they are still not secular , just not violent , either themselves or by proxy . 
  really ? 
  because last time i checked germany was part of the eu . 
  and in the eu , the countries vote on their common interests . 
  but whatever i must be wrong . 
  tl ; dr if you do n't want refugees , then do n't sign treaties that say you will accept them . 
  many societies throughout history have been called democratic , but none of them have been based purely on the idea of majority vote . 
  i submit to you that majority vote is a dreadful idea on its own . 
  there needs to be a framework for it to work . 
  by western standards , we have the right to free thought and free expression for instance . 
  those should be obvious parts of such a framework . 
  majority vote would be a waste of time without them . 
  i 'm not even going to list the rest of the necessities for majority vote to mean jack shit . 
  the point is that whoever complains that their democratic rights are being violated because people come to seek asylum is a clueless twit . 
  that still does n't change the fact that plenty of muslims do `` pick and choose '' . 
   muslim that follow less they religion are better ? 
   the polls don \u00b4 t have simply grain of truth , they show that large ( ranging from 30 to 80 ) groups of muslim worldwide hold certain beliefs that are bad .

  and if not how is this whole stealth idea even worthwhile ? 
  i mean the stealth would have to be * dramatically * better if f35 is going to be any good vs russian anti air for instance , if it 's just `` slightly better '' with a lot better aerodynamics then what have you really gained except a more expensive f-16,

  nowhere am i justifying the russian state as it stands . 
  what i 'm saying is it is developing into absolutist dictatorship , not totalitarianism . 
  and no they are not the same thing, 
  i understand the impulse to demonize russia/putin but what they have is not and will never be a totalitarian state partly because they do n't have the military or administrative capability to enforce such a state and partly because it would infringe on the orthodox church too much for the public to support it edit : to add : the anti-gay law you referenced is evidence of my point . 
  the russian state has never had an anti-gay agenda and the only reason this law exists is to placate the orthodoxy . 
  this is because the state knows it is not strong enough to stand on its own and must have church support . 
  a totalitarian state is incompatible with a strong and independent church . 
  it is however very compatible with absolutist rule ( source : most of 16-1900s europe ) . 
  this is common in all states it does n't make them totalitarian though for instance you are not allowed to own certain substances ( drugs ) or consume alcohol in certain places ( in most countries ) , this is an infringement in order to keep civil order but it 's not totalitarian, 
  fyi historical fascists actually self identified as fascist , it was n't always just used as a synonym for `` evil '', 
  i do n't think putin wants totalitarianism , he wants absolutism , which is not the same . 
  north korea is totalitarian ( the state dictates everything in your life ) , saudi arabia is absolutist ( a single person dictates what the state does ) you can have a totalitarian republic,

  during wwi `` the morning hate '' referred to the ritual break-of-day artillery firestorm ordered by officers to prevent soldiers in the trenches from becoming complacent and/or unwilling to shoot the enemy on / r/europe i think of it as the obligatory torrent of swedish immigration articles and opinion pieces that have accumulated in the new section during the night, 
  . . is what swedes would like to think what it actually is is swedes are lazy and like comfy chairs so we stay within insulated walls 95 % of the day, 
  there 's been a housing problem for a long time in sweden to begin with ( or rather i should say , in major cities ) adding a 27 000 + influx of people needing a place to stay does n't exactly help i think the deal is this : swedish municipalities are tasked with finding somewhere to house x amount of refugees and are payed y amount of tax money ( cover costs + some more to make it an attractive thing for other municipalities to join in too ) . 
  the municipality then goes and finds somewhere to house the refugees ( hotels , rental housing etc. ), 
  now the way it 's set up it seems like in at least this one case the money awarded to the municipality is such that normal tenants ca n't pay parity with what the municipality would pay if the landlord hosted refugees instead of regular tenants , and so the landlord chooses the refugees why they get this much money per refugee i do n't know but i guess it might be some kind of idea to promote integration since we 've seen refugees are pretty unhappy if their housing ends up somewhere outside of a major city so maybe the municipalities get extra money so they can house them in more expensive ( central ) places, 
  but where is proofs ? 
  aka the uk has the most bankers/richfucks to skew the distribution, 
  having a narrow distribution does not guarantee a higher mean - everyone can be equally poor, 
  just to make this abundantly clear : there are very few things about the `` liberal party '' that you can actually call liberal their real name is `` the people 's party '' and they are pretty much exactly as authoritarian as their real name implies, 
  i know you might not understand this but altruism goes deeper than having your secretary bring you fair-trade coffee, 
  i never once had my english proficiency tested when applying for a us visa this is n't even remotely a relevant issue here it 's about the us only wanting beneficial immigration while taking as little responsibility for the instability they have created around the globe as possible, 
   i think in usa their definition of immigration is broader than just taking in refugees . 
  it 's broader in every country but no one is talking about limiting skilled immigration, 
  this is not the racist part the racist part is that they have a campaign targeting * specifically * immigrants as needing to work , the underlying assumption is that a. they do n't and b. they should because they owe it to `` us '' ( meaning us danes as different from `` them '' the immigrants ) also the work part is n't even the whole message i understand if you do n't read danish but they also call for stricter asylum rules right in the middle of a global refugee crisis and `` more demands on immigrants '' the last part is n't even specified what it is but it meant to convey a general sense that people who come to denmark have to earn their welcome rather than being welcomed from the outset this campaign plays to a political climate which reflects the attitude of danes towards immigrants , and it is clearly not a welcoming one, 
  yes but how is any of this relevant to whether we should honor our asylum obligations ? 
  the only relevant points are these : 1 . we 've made agreements 2 . we are committed to upholding those agreements in an * honest way * meaning we accept refugees primarily on the basis of * their * need , not our own . 
  3 . denmark is apparently not, 
  i 'd say the high proportion of degree holders from nigeria is mostly because if you are from nigeria and do n't have a degree or on your way to a degree you are simply not allowed into the us, 
  tolerance of someone who behaves just like yourself is not really tolerance though when we talk about a tolerant society we normally talk about tolerance of diversity e.g. 
  tolerance of practicing muslims in sweden the majority of people still have the aspiration to be a * tolerant * society , in denmark i would say tolerance has only ever been the idea that people can behave like danes do regardless of , or ( depending on the degree of racism ) in spite of , their ethnic background, 
   the amount of racists and xenophobes in the general population is at very similar percentages in both countries , but the media landscape is vastly different . 
  this is probably true but even abraham lincoln owned slaves it is possible to not be a racist and still participate and perpetuate a public debate that is framed in a racist way also you do n't have to be an overt racist to disconnect your empathy from the sheer number of refugees that currently need to be taken care of , but doing so results in discussions where the rights and lives of those refugees become vastly undervalued compred to trivial things like a `` hygglig '' copenhagen city life, 
  if the argument is that the current political climate in denmark is not evidence of nation-wide racism because it is a `` factual discussion about what we can reasonably afford '' as you suggested . 
  then having a poster explicitly singling out immigrants as `` having to work '' being part of `` empty rhetoric '' if anything proves the opposite namely that danes are by and large pretty racist and the current political climate in denmark is a reflection of this, 
  it is pretty meaningless though as socioeconomic status , as commonly used , is a nebulous concept and therefore `` adjusting '' for it really just means `` adjusting for wealth/income gap '' which is not the same, 
   it is , but that does n't mean that we should n't be willing to talk about culture . 
  we should n't let racism or fear of it dictate political dialogue . 
  what meaningful discussion can be had regarding `` culture '' though ? 
  who is silencing debate ? 
  what debate ? 
  if the debate you want to have is about if x ethnicity has a culture that makes them y and therefore we should z then i can make redundant all future such debates by the statement `` no set of xyz exists such that legislation should target x '', 
  `` adjusting for socioeconomic status '' is not something you can simply do nor is any social science study accurate enough to where this would be a meaningful thing to try to do, 
   saying `` we can only handle x amount of immigrants '' http://www.thelocal.dk/20150323/danish-pm-party-touts-hardline-on-immigration that 's not what you are saying nor the rhetoric you would use to say that the posted campaign shows pretty clearly what the view of immigrants is in denmark , which is `` you betta pick dat cotton son or ya get the whip again '', 
  no but it is common practice for genuine racists to substitute culture for race in order to present a racist point of view while pretending to not be racist analogous to a slave owner saying `` it 's in their culture to pick cotton , i 'm not a racist '', 
  they are unhappy about how racist we are making them look, 
   there is no reason why a college educated person in europe should n't be allowed to apply for any job they are qualified for over here . 
  my problem is not how hard it is for europeans to work in the us , it is in fact pretty easy ( having done it myself ) my problem is it is * so much easier * for europeans to work in the us compared to iranians/iraqis/pick a country, 
  http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jun/19/refugees-unhcr-statistics-data the us accepts about the same number of unhcr refugees as the uk and sweden this is not proportionally what the us should be taking in as for immigration there are two hurdles for coming to the us : 1 . you have to get there ( rules out refugees pretty much ) 2 . if you are an immigrant , you have to be `` wanted '' in regards to point 1 , most european countries take in so-called quota refugees from un camps which means taking in refugees that are normally not able to get to your country and for point 2 . the us immigration system is notoriously geared towards accepting `` skilled '' immigrants, 
  the us is not exactly picking up any slack though http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jun/19/refugees-unhcr-statistics-data taking in the same absolute numbers as the uk, 
  most people in sweden know this and are ok with it most people recognize that the over representation in crime statistics and otherwise has to do with socioeconomic factors and want the discussion to be about reducing these factors ( become a better society ) rather than about if we should respect international agreements on asylum seekers ( give up our national morals , like you have in denmark ), 
  good contribution to the discussion, 
  young to young-adult men are more likely to be racist young to young-adult men are more likely to be on reddit young to young-adult men are more likely to favor a counter-mainstream narrative the overlap is significant, 
  i expect 12 points for our soulless hip-hop bastardization of david guetta [ compare ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpiw0tkwfeg ) and [ give 12s pls ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhflqrw3sss ), 
  not like norway owes its well-being to a hard work ethic nor do you put your wealth to any particularly good causes so do n't see why you got ta hate bruh,

  no that 's completely false . 
  swedish has * ridiculous * amounts of ( low ) german loan words from the middle ages , a result of the hanseatic league . 
  they 're just so thoroughly swedified by now that it is n't apparent anymore . 
  no other language even comes close to having the kind of influence on swedish as low german has had . 
  it could almost be compared to the relationship between norman french and english . 
  disregarding borrowings though , danish is obviously more closely related to german than swedish is , being closer . 
  not at all . 
  there is plenty of stupid shit about the usa that i hate , but also lots of amazing shit that i love . 
  we know all americans are n't retarded , but the ones that * are * do seem to be exceedingly so , and in a way that is particularly infuriating for europeans . 
  at a whopping 53 meters and 15 stories , the [ eurostop ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eon3kgew9ae/tbhdqjjabsi/aaaaaaaafri/3s7gpx0nahk/s1600/eurostop%2b113.jpg ) along the motorway is apparently the tallest building in my city of ~ 90k inhabitants . 
  i believe it 's a hotel of some sort . 
  well , i do n't actually want to move to another country , so i just interpreted the question as ` if you absolutely * had * to ' ... 
  good luck getting the attention of ancient gods without sacrificing !, 
  uh , unchanged . 
  i do n't really see what the big deal is , to be honest . 
  i 'm not interested in politics in the slightest and am not too sure what the eu actually does or how it affects my life . 
  feels like sweden would do fine without , too . 
  but what the fuck do i know ? 
  obviously nothing . 
  uk 's still cool , though . 
  i do n't know about the rest of europe , but in sweden , what you 're describing is how most roundabouts work . 
  there are exceptions where they 've made custom solutions to suit the roads better and make traffic flow , but it 's always clearly marked by arrows . 
  norway or denmark would be my first options , because it would require the least amount of effort . 
  i 'd adjust to the language in about a week and culture is already so similar that i 'd fit in just fine . 
  could also visit sweden whenever i wanted . 
  after that , maybe somewhere in the uk or ireland . 
  like , somewhere in the countryside where all you do is go to the pub every day and banter with your neighbours . 
  i think that kind of life might suit me . 
  it 's a really well known foreign language . 
  i still remember having to learn it as a child and getting better at it throughout my life , while swedish has always just felt completely natural , like an integral part of me . 
  even though i speak it very well , i still make new discoveries with english and have to actively think about how to express myself properly and grammatically , which i never have to do with swedish . 
  so there 's definitely a big difference there . 
  i do n't really see what you mean by making english official . 
  like , replace swedish with english ? 
  no , why would we do that ? 
  we 've spoken swedish here for a thousand years , i do n't see us stopping anytime soon . 
  and yes i would very much like more media in swedish . 
  podcasts , in particular . 
  i have to travel a lot and consume hours and hours of podcasts every week , but there 's extremely few good ones in swedish , which is a shame . 
  it 's actually very similar to the swedish spoken in sk\u00e5ne . 
  it 's weird to hear it because it 's got all the same weird diphtongs and melody but uses danish words and grammar . 
  it 's more like the sk\u00e5ne dialect is supposed to sound , i guess . 
   is racism really that bad in europe to this day ? 
  you do n't hear about it very often around here . 
  not really , but that 's because we 've been trying to let go of these ideas for 70 years now . 
  then americans come along , all psyched about their ethnicity : `` wooo !, 
  pure swedish viking blood , baby !, 
  usa !, 
  usa !, 
  usa ! '', 
  ( sorry , that 's my impression of an american ) , not realizing that this sort of thinking can be quite unsettling for europeans . 
  the only people still in europe with that mindset are hardcore neo-nazis pretty much , so that 's where my mind automatically goes when i encounter that attitude . 
  i do n't want to hear about how swedish your genes are . 
  it 's incredibly off-putting , frankly , and certainly not something that you should be proud of or place any importance on . 
  hey now , it 's only dark half of the year . 
  the rest of the half is incredibly bright to make up for the darkness . 
  we still drink a ton though . 
  edit : `` the rest of the half ? '', 
  what the fuck does that even mean ? 
  leaving it . 
  what 's annoying is when americans just straight up say `` i 'm irish '' ( or italian , norwegian , polish , or whatever ) . 
  you 're not , you 're an american with european ancestors , like almost everyone else in your country . 
  just say `` my great-grandfather came from ireland '' if it 's somehow interesting or noteworthy to you that your ancestors came from somewhere else , even though that 's pretty much the case for literally every person on earth . 
  americans sure seem to find that fact about themselves absolutely fascinating . 
  it 's why our countryside is sparsely populated - it takes too long to construct those complicated roofs . 
  denmark was n't much involved with the hanseatic league at all , and was actually in conflict or even at war with it for much of its existence . 
  of the scandinavian countries , sweden was the only one who played a big part in the hanseatic league . 
  interestingly , our involvement actually changed our language a lot , from the influx of thousands of low german loanwords , making it quite distinct in terms of vocabulary from danish and norwegian , who never had thousands of germans living in their cities . 
  obviously all the nordic countries are very similar , but i 'm actually going to say germany . 
  the northern parts , specifically ; things start to get weird the more south you go . 
  but the north of germany looks and feels * exactly * like home to me , except that everyone 's speaking german . 
  i 've never been to finland , though . 
  i have a feeling it would be extremely familiar also . 
  not really . 
  i could probably guess if someone 's from southern , northern . 
  eastern or western europe , but that 's about the extent of my accuracy . 
  ( and it 's not like i 'll even get that right ) edit : but like others in the thread , my `` own '' people are fairly easy to spot most of the time . 
  i recognize swedes and other scandinavians from a mile away by their familiar awkwardness . 
  i rest my case . 
  they 're mostly like us , except most of them speak finnish , which is a ridiculous language , and i do n't know why they insist on it , frankly . 
  well , like most changes in language , it was n't instant . 
  it took a long time for `` rolig '' to change from `` calm '' to `` funny '' - like several centuries long , with many stages in between . 
  but simplified a bit , you can think of it as first widening in meaning from `` calm '' to simply `` positive in general '' and then narrowing down again , but to `` funny '' instead of its original meaning . 
  nope . 
  the firstborn child of the monarch is next in line . 
  used to be firstborn son , but we changed when our current king had a daughter . 
  our history is your history as well . 
  pre 1809 that is . 
  uh , soft drinks are usually called `` l\u00e4sk '' . 
  i 'm not overly fond of gothenburg myself , to be honest . 
  i find the typical jolly gothenburg attitude really fake , like they 're just trying to live up to everyone 's expectations somehow . 
  also the city is fucking impossible to drive in , it 's like its roads are designed by drunk children . 
  well stockholm is a much bigger city than gothenburg , so there 's naturally more to do there . 
  also , i 'm not saying any of that is actually true , it 's just the reputation the city has in sweden . 
  no , there 's no place where * everyone * would like it , obviously , but gothenburg probably has the best reputation out of all swedish cities . 
  it 's known for having jolly , good natured people and gothenburgers are all supposed to be relaxed and laid back . 
  even their accent is famous for sounding happy and carefree . 
  compare with stockholm that 's universally hated by everyone who does n't live there . 
  fair enough . 
  ah sorry i missed that `` ago '' .

  unless also counting svalbard which is somewhat a special case , ~ 1000km north of mainland europe 's northernmost tip . 
  i had planned a longer vacation trip to south korea , hong kong and japan ( + probably a few more destinations over a couple of months ) some years ago ... but things got unusually busy at work , so i postponed the vacation for career reasons ( in hindsight a terrible move ) ... then my friend i was going to travel with passed away . 
  -- however , i still ca n't really grasp how ** easy ** it is to travel , as i did n't really grow up with it being talked about . 
  when i grew up i had only norway and finland within reasonably distance for traveling `` internationally '' . 
  ^ ( well , also northern russia , which at the time was the soviet union , so that was out of the question . 
  even long after the su fell apart ... 
  besides , northern russia is mostly just mining communities and protected military complexes ; not exactly tourist destinations either way . ), 
  airfares were prohibitively expensive back then , compared to the last couple of decades ( no competing low fare airlines back then ) . 
  and as a northerner , traveling abroad was a lot more expensive than for southerners since i would have to get to an international airport first , which would in many cases add 40-100 % to the cost ... and also add a lot on travel time . 
  looking at a map ; the distance from my hometown to southernmost sweden , not to mention neighboring counties in the south , like denmark and ( west ) germany , was roughly the same as ontario - florida or southeastern alaska - california . 
  here a clip from the day after : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfa-h6yhzog ( interview in swedish ; but the clip also shows the hungover moose recovering in the garden ... before being strong enough to leave . ), 
  well , could n't it possibly be that the made statement actually had a point ? 
  economic desperation leads to desperate actions , and while not everyone crippled by unbearable medical bills necessarily becomes murderous international drug lords , it * does * evidently lead to increased crime rates ... that might affect anyone . 
  besides ; the us still spends * more * taxdollars per capita on healthcare than pretty much any other country , but the cost of use for average mundane care is * still * crippling for many people , * even * with insurance . 
  it 's a mess where costs are inflated due to hunt for profit maximization by several parties in the supply chain . 
  what 's the reason behind letting police services , fire & rescue services , public roads , public schools , libraries , national parks , etc being free at the point of usage ... but not health care ? 
  you can call for the cops , fire brigade , sea/mountain rescue , etc , without being billed ( assuming the calls were warranted , and not deliberate misused or `` prank calls '' ) ... 
  but you * ca n't * call for an ambulance by the same terms . 
  what 's the differences between a fireman , a cop and a paramedic ? 
  or rather what 's the difference that leads to one of them being considered an `` optional luxury '' as opposed to the other two ? 
  -- if i plan to buy a new tv , i can compare prices between stores and ** choose ** whatever i want ... but if i do n't find any interesting deal , i can also choose ** not ** to buy one . 
  life still goes on . 
  i can still live perfectly fine without a new tv . 
  but if i get hit by a drunk driver and is unconsciously taken to a hospital , and spend a couple of weeks in a coma , it 's not a business deal i 'm actively choosing . 
  it 's not a `` free market '' if the `` customer '' has no choice ... ... then also consider the possibility that drunk driver perhaps * being * a drunk because of self-medicated depression ; after loosing a kid to cancer . 
  he could n't afford cancer treatment for his kid , but is still financially screwed just for * diagnosing * the cancer ; and he also could n't afford psychiatric counseling after the kid died . 
  i admit there are a few benefits with your system . 
  for example , it gave us the premise of breaking bad , one of top 10 best tv-series i 've seen ... 
  the plot would have been ridiculous in any other developed country . 
  you can * live * without owning a ferrari . 
  what 's the point of having the `` best care available '' , if it 's at the same time not * realistically * available due to prohibitive costs ? 
  `` oh , you have this rare type of cancer , making you unable to work due to inconceivable pain ? . 
  lucky for you there 's this treatment that wi ... oh , wait ... you 're unemployed and broke since you 're unable to work due to pain ? 
  then you unfortunately do n't belong to our target group ... 
  some years ago , the prison guards at a high security facility * forgot * to lock in a few inmates at night . 
  6 prisoners escaped ... ... to the kitchen . 
  where they then spent the night baking chocolate mud cake . 
  and cozied it up in a pillow fort , watching tv . 
  one news article also stated that when the huge blunder was discovered , there was nothing left of the cake , and * the embarrassed night staff had n't been offered any of it . 
  not a single piece * . 
   even the swedish !, 
  they just do n't use a special word for it . 
  ** mys ** ^ noun ; ** mysa ** ^ verb ; ** mysig / mysigt ** ^ ( adjective and adverb ) carrying pretty much exactly the same meaning as the danish words , as well as the norwegian , * kose * ; * koselig * . 
  there 's also ** hygglig/hyggligt ** , which is related to the danish word , but means more * decent * , * ok * , * reasonably * , * nice-or-pleasant-but-not-fantastic * . 
  and there 's also the ( excessively formal and oldfashioned ) ** gemytlig/gemytligt ** , which is obviously a loan from german . 
  i once looked at a jar of marshmallow fluff at the american corner of the international section of my local store . 
  i laughed when i read on the back of the jar : `` spread on sandwiches , as part of a healthy and nutritional breakfast '' . 
  seriously ... * part of a healthy and nutritional breakfast * ? 
  it 's 98 % sugar and hfcs ... with the remaining part being a minuscule amount of artificial flavorings and egg whites . 
  it 's possibly one of the ** least ** healthy and nutritional thing you could even imagine putting on a sandwich ... 
  zero nutritional value , and will just cause an insulin crash ; making you feel dizzy and fatigued about an hour later . 
  eating a wax candle would supply you with the same amount of minerals and vitamins ( if not * more * ) , but without making your blood glucose levels go on a rollercoaster . 
  -- edit : i also find nutella , which is `` only '' 50 % sugar , repulsive as a sandwich spread . 
  it 's * candy * , not * food * ... 
  i always * prefer * taking a train over flying , for distances under let 's say 1000km . 
  both more convenient and cheaper , and also better from an emissions standpoint . 
  with a train you usually do n't have any restrictive luggage limits ; no transfers , just go directly from city center to city center ; no queuing for luggage check-ins , no queuing in security checks ; no long waits before boarding the plane , etc. . . just board the train , read a book , have a meal , have a nap , and you 're there ... 
  but * over * 1000km , i feel the opposite . 
  i have a 1600km domestic train trip booked the next week . 
  i 'm not really looking forward to spending ( in best case ) 21 hours on the train , each way . 
  the trip itself is usually ok , and i often meet some fun person to chat with during the trip , but it 's the * uncertainty * and unreliability that gets me ... 
  i mean , severe delays are n't too uncommon during this time of year ; anything from a couple of hours to several days . 
  last time i was delayed * over a week * on my way home . 
  a combination of canceled trains due to reindeer collisions , and canceled trains due to `` extreme weather '' , i.e regular ordinary swedish winter time . 
  i had a look at wikipedia : https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/gamla_svenska_m%c3%a5tt hardly any of the old units are actually used nowadays , except the ones already mentioned . 
  a few not - * too * - old-fashioned ones are : * * aln * ( ell ) - distance between elbow and tip of middle finger ~ 59cm * * famn * ( fathom ) - the distance between a man 's outstretched arms = 6 * fot * = 1.78 m * * rast * ( rest ) - walking distance in forests before having a break ~ 5km * * steg * ( pace ) - a long step = 1/2 * famn * or 85-90cm * * tunnland * ( barrel of land ) - the area used to sow a barrel of grains ~ 1/2 hectare = 5000m \u00b2 * * tv\u00e4rhand * ( handbreadth/palm ) - the width of a hand ~ 4 * tum * or 8-10 cm * * kanna * ( pitcher ) * * fat * ( keg ) * * tunna * ( barrel ) few of the above are used as actual units today , but * may * in some cases be heard in fixed phrases and expressions . 
  -- one interesting one i ca n't say i had heard before was * * yxkast * - the distance you 'd throw an axe . 
  was apparently an occasionally used unit in legal documents during the middle ages . 
  [ relevant satw ] ( http://satwcomic.com/doctor-strange ) mads mikkelsen is however a great actor . 
  jagten / `` the hunt '' was * intense * , and i also like his characters in somewhat older films like flickering lights . 
  -- edit : [ a scene from flickering lights ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe4zbck01hu ) . 
  ( unfortunately no subtitles ), 
   coincidentally , 
  satw is actually pretty accurate . 
  that said ; finland has been *** very *** important throughout swedish history ... from the middle ages up until 1809 ( edit : and then also keeping both the soviets * and * the nazis occupied during wwii . ), 
  without finland , who knows what sweden would have been today . 
  probably would n't even exist as an independent country ; being squeezed between historically warmongering denmark , poland and russia ... 
  i 'm not saying sweden was n't equally ( or more ) warmongering back then ... but it was easy/easier being cocky when you had the determined kamikaze finns on your side . 
  northern sweden : finland western sweden : norway southern sweden : denmark stockholm : whichever country happened to be perceived as trendy and fashionable at the era . 
   the formal name here is ` storbritannien ' ( great britain ) , and the colloquial name is just ` england ' . 
  well , the actual formal name in swedish is '' * f\u00f6renade konungariket storbritannien och nordirland * '' , but you rarely hear it ... mostly just `` storbritannien '' . 
  ... or very casually : `` england '' , but it * most * cases `` england '' refer to just england proper . 
  ( although , to some people it just just means * london * ) . 
  - far , f\u00e5r f\u00e5r f\u00e5r ?

  ( yeah , i see the lake ), 
  speaking of junk food for drunk people . 
  in the north of sweden a [ parisare ] ( https://ohmansmatovin.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/parisare.jpg?w=630 ) is a grilled crosscut of a huge sausage . 
  served in a hamburger bun with ketchup , mustard , and either ' [ bostongurka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bostongurka ) ' or ` gurksallad ' ( bostongurka mixed with mayonnaise ) . 
  -- the parisergrill-sausage itself has a very finely ground texture , contains lots of fillers like potato starch and water ( ~ 50-55 % meat ) , and hardly any noticeable spices at all ( * trace amounts * of nutmeg , ginger , onions , salt , pepper ) . 
  it 's basically a jumbo-sized falukorv . 
  i 'm in my mid 30s , and i know exactly * two * persons , my age or younger , who are religious ( and conforming to a major religion ) ; both christians . 
  they also happen to be the only religious people i know who are younger than 85 . 
  although there are some religious folks out there , i just do n't personally know that many ... or rather , i do n't know * if * someone else i know is religious . 
  most people who have any kind of religious beliefs are very casual and laid back about it , and does n't care much about the church/mosque/etc ... 
  religion and spirituality is mostly a personal opinion , and seldom a conversational topic . 
  i mean , i can sometimes go about with my life for up to maybe a year without hearing * anyone * talk about personal religious beliefs . 
  -- the vast majority of people i meet in my daily life are atheist , or * are percieved * as atheists . 
  religion is simply not very noticeable at all .

  regardless if you believe it occurred or not . 
  ukraine should speed up the reform process and work towards peace . 
  i was quite shocked when i came across this public data but most ukrainians ( 70 % ) are still deeply unhappy with the government . 
  if the government fails to deliver then i do n't think it is unthinkable that new mass protests will occur .

  ukraine should realise that it is imperative to speed up the reform process and work towards peace , not against it . 
  that is if ukraine still wants the support of the west . 
  nice attempt at history revisionism . 
  the joined peacekeeping force was the result of an agreement being signed between the head of parliament of georgia , eduard shevardnadze , and the president of russia , boris yeltsin . 
  thus , to claim that the peacekeeping force was ` unilateral and illegal ' is nothing short of hogwash . 
  georgia , russia and south ossetia were all members of it . 
  additionally , georgia remained part of it through out the entire conflict , as it was only in september that georgia withdrew .

  ** job losses loom for london 's fund industry after brexit ** city will lose out to ireland and luxembourg london 's fund industry will be hit by job losses after the uk voted to leave the eu . 
  the move sent shockwaves through the asset management sector and triggered turmoil in global financial markets . 
  britain voted by 51.9 per cent to sever the uk 's relationship with the eu on thursday , prompting fears that asset managers will cut staff and relocate others out of london to maintain access to european investors . 
  at least one fund manager rushed to draw up legal notices to stop redemptions from their investment products on friday , as the impact of the referendum became apparent . 
  it is understood that the financial conduct authority , the uk watchdog , contacted asset managers last week to check how well equipped they were to deal with redemptions in the wake of an exit . 
  amin rajan , chief executive of create research , the consultancy , said job cuts were now on the cards for the fund industry , which had been banking on a remain vote . 
  several fund managers are putting plans in place to move jobs from the city of london , the uk 's financial centre , to countries such as ireland and luxembourg , which are big centres for the asset management industry . 
  they fear a british exit -- or brexit -- would leave uk-based asset managers struggling to access european investors . 
  one of the uk 's best-known fund houses will move some jobs to luxembourg , according to an employee who was familiar with its plans and spoke on the condition anonymity . 
  `` we wo n't be moving our headquarters , but we do need to think about our resourcing in luxembourg , '' the employee said . 
  mr rajan said : `` over the next five years , the centre of gravity will shift to dublin and luxembourg for retail funds ; and frankfurt and paris for institutional funds . 
  london 's pre-eminence can no longer be taken for granted . '' earlier this year , the central bank of ireland , the financial watchdog , said it was preparing for an influx of investment managers from the uk to ireland if brexit were to happen . 
  pat lardner , chief executive of irish funds , a trade body , said : `` there is a uniqueness about our relationship with the uk fund industry . 
  and ireland has a deep relationship with the uk . 
  so that puts us in a strong position to help . '' camille thommes , director-general of alfi , the luxembourg fund association , added : `` for industry players this starts a period of uncertainty , and some might look for alternative jurisdictions , such as luxembourg or ireland . '' the uk 's exit from the eu comes at a tough time for asset managers , which are already dealing with falling profit margins and concerns about performance . 
  this month , mckinsey , the consultancy , forecast that profits at asset managers would fall by a third over the next two years . 
  daniel godfrey , former head of the ia , the trade body representing uk fund managers , who is currently working with the uk regulator , said the out vote would pile further pressure on asset managers . 
  `` there is an immediate downside for asset managers . 
  plunging valuations means plunging assets , and that will dent revenues . 
  the potential slowdown in uk gross domestic product would also result in prolonged pain for the market , '' he said . 
  `` all industries will see job cuts in that scenario and asset management will be no different . '' investment companies have tried to reassure investors about the impact of a brexit , amid fears they will pull huge sums of money from investment products . 
  assets in the uk fund industry have already fallen by a fifth over the past 12 months . 
  chelsea financial services , the uk fund supermarket , said on friday there had been a 10 per cent rise in investors looking to switch funds or move from funds to cash , or vice versa . 
  the uk and the eu now face what is likely to be a lengthy negotiation to unwind britain 's 43-year membership of the trading bloc . 
  saker nusseibeh , chief executive of hermes investment management , the uk fund house , said the outlook for markets and the fund industry relies partly on the outcome of the negotiations between the uk and the eu . 
  the city is expected to fight hard to maintain strong trading links with the eu . 
  however , britain is already receiving pushback from eu states saying there will be no renegotiation of the uk 's membership . 
  mr nusseibeh said : `` there is an expectation we will see a sharp and short reaction [ to the brexit vote ] . 
  my concern is this could be prolonged : that this is a steady decline rather than a short and sharp decline . 
  `` but asset management as a business is something that the uk is very good at . 
  i am sure it will survive , but for some it will be tough . '', 
  the ftse 100 closed at -3.15 % , but as you can see , my comment was referring to ** ftse 250 ** , which closed at -7.18 % . 
  ftse 250 is known to be a better representation of the british economy , as it includes ewer multinationals and more home-grown businesses than the ftse 100 . http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/stocks/indices/summary/summary-indices.html?index=ukx http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/stocks/indices/summary/summary-indices.html?index=mcx additionally , i am not referring to morgan stanley rumour . 
  it is unthinkable for a bank to immediately cut jobs a few hours after the referendum . 
  but the process to shift part of the operations to the uk has already commenced . 
  stop spreading misinformation . 
  ftse 250 closed down 7 % , going to be a long time before the market calms down . 
  likely to see further volatile until brexit is complete . 
  project fear was no bluff , major banks have already launched contingency plans to shift part of the operations to eu . 
  if the uk fails to negotiate a deal including ` passporting rights ' . 
  the banks will not be able to operate across the continent . 
  by remaining in the eu , banks based in the uk were able to provide services to the whole of the eu without having local offices . 
  london is the financial centre of world due to this and favourable banking regulations . 
  capital economics predict that exports of financial services to the european union will decrease by half ( # 10bn ) additionally , the ecb has previously attempted to deny non-euro zone clearing houses euro liquidity . 
  as the most powerful non-euro zone member has just left the eu it will be a lot more difficult to stop any future attempt . 
  which if it passes will force euro clearing and settlement to take place within the euro zone . 
  definitely not going to be business as usual without passporting rights . 
  if passporting rights for uk based financial services is lost i can guarantee you it wo n't be business as usual . 
  `` we believe that the scottish parliament should have the right to hold another referendum if there is clear and sustained evidence that independence has become the preferred option of a majority of the scottish people -- or if there is a significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014 , such as scotland being taken out of the eu against our will . '' if the uk parliament denies them this option , it 's not unthinkable for them to unilaterally launch a referendum . 
  - the pound has plummeted to a 30 year low - japanese stock market has crashed 8 % and suspended trading - already a push for another scottish independence - calls for an irish reunification referendum - far-right nationalists across europe now calling for referendums and the demise of the eu - hundreds of uk pension funds underwater - ftse is expected to open 10 % down ( the bankers knocked 8 % off in the 2007 financial crash , so this is big ) - german dax market expected to open 10 % down - hsbc is worth # 10bn less since yesterday - s&p has announced that uk now likely to lose its aaa credit rating - in two hours ( as of 7am ) the uk economy has lost over # 255bn , the equivalent of 40 years ' worth of eu contributions - our prime minister has resigned, 
  `` in almost all western assessments , the exercise is described as concluding with a simulated nuclear strike on warsaw . 
  but this scenario appears problematic ; in a discussion with the author , a senior russian military officer who had been a member of the planning committee for zapad-2009 was surprised to hear this and said that a simulated nuclear strike had never been part of the exercise . 
  much of the english language reporting on the subject can be traced back to a single news story in the united kingdom 's daily telegraph by matthew day , entitled ` russia `` simulates '' nuclear attack on poland ' . 
  this headline , not written by the reporter , is not supported by the actual content of the story , and there is no mention of an attack on warsaw . '',

   russian official military doctrine involves pre-emptive nuclear strike . 
  false . 
  the russian military doctrine no longer has a preemptive nuclear strike provision . 
  it 's still a developing partnership with china . 
  way to early to call it a failed partnership as we have not seen the full-scope of cooperation set to take place . 
  already seeing significant improvement in bilateral relations and joint stances on topics such as ukraine and south china sea . 
  additionally , over 30 deals were signed last december during the 20th china-russia prime ministers ' regular meeting . 
  ranging from energy , investment , finance , high technology and more . 
  both countries set to benefit immensely from closer ties so we are just seeing the start of sino-russian cooperation .

  swedish 20-year-old guy here . 
  i , as well as most of my friends , are very eu-sceptic . 
  what type of people have you been hanging out with ? 
   we 've just got quite a few crackpots . 
  we ue-sceptics base our sceptisism on the fact that most eu-states are far more corrupt than sweden , the fact that sweden pays more to the eu then we get back , and the recent arrival of numerous so called eu-immigrants ( read : roma beggars and thieves ) . 
  believe me , our scepticism has very little to do with crack . 
  i was asking the canadian . 
  i satirised over the irony in making that statement as a white north american . 
  not that i 'm against nationalism by default . 
  then there 's a difference in the degree of supremacy , not in its nature . 
   i mean , this is mostly anecdotal and first-hand , but i do n't think so many of my friends have misjudged these places . 
  i agree with you . 
  even though it 's anecdotal i find it hard to believe that these stories are wrong when they 're practically the same in every immigrant neighbourhood all over europe , from lampedusa in the south to small refugee homes in the scandinavian wastelands . 
   no , i do n't have any sources to support that suspicion . 
  as usual in this debate . 
  no , the question is angled . 
  they asked something like : would you accept immigration from bulgaria and romania if they worked and integrated ? 
  this says nothing about what englishmen , scotsmen , welshmen and irishmen actually think of immigration as a whole . 
  why is it scary ? 
  argue against it instead of stating your emotions . 
  are you trying to portray an entire group of activists as wrong based on your personal observations of grammar among their comments ? 
  so people who come from across the seas should respect and integrate with the community they reach , eh ? 
   plus , it is an obligation according to international law to help refugess running away from war . 
  says countries that have no problem with bombing libya in order to secure oil and gold . 
  so we pay for you to wash and feed the immigrants before they come to us to live on our work ? 
  this is a typical issue . 
  immigrants in sweden are always pro-immigration until some rivalising group from their homelands comes here . 
  then they turn into vicious protectionists . 
  as a non-brit , i would actually like to hear those details . 
   and as sad as it makes me , this is often just a disguised discussion of how to keep the roma out , many of who are from romania or bulgaria , and many of who - for whatever reasons - are poor and have little to no education . 
  people see them as beggars in the streets , and this is what shapes the image in politicians heads . 
  some romanians are even mad because people confuse them with roma . 
  ad hominem and straw-man . 
   seriously , we had the exact same discussion in 2011 , when germany finally liftet the working ban for the first round of eastern eu-states . 
  the result of immigration from one group of countries does not predict the result of immigration from another group of countries . 
  romania and bulgaria are countries with far greater issues than the countries previously included . 
  you can not compare romania with poland . 
   if your sex life , and your potential long-term relationship , is strictly for procreation then i can only feel sorry for you , you are in an extremely tiny , and boring , minority . 
  these personal opinions of yours do not disprove my statement that human sexuality is a means of reproduction . 
  same could be said about food . 
  food is for our survival , but we also enjoy it . 
  that does n't mean that you can live solely on candy meerely because you enjoy it . 
   he said : it 's like marrying a sheep . 
  he 's not comparing the sheep to the homosexual being wedded . 
  he 's comparing the act of wedding a sheep to the act of wedding a person of the same sex . 
  so dagestanis are russian muslims ? 
  and is there oil there as well ? 
  if so i know a country that might be interested . 
  she was a sex bomb , alright . 
  whilst rubbing your balls and your vagina . 
  that 's a straw-man argument . 
  he never called homosexuals animals , he said that their sexual orientation is equally deviant as that of those who prefer sex with sheep . 
  and he does have a point ; sexuality is a means for reproduction . 
  how can homosexuality be evolutionary sane ? 
  actually it does . 
  being in majoroty does n't protect you from being portrayed negatively .

  we were n't neutral during finnish winter war , but non-beligerent .

  we also sold to the allied . 
  being neutral we could n't count on brittish coal to import , so we had to buy from germany . 
  like we did before and after the war . 
  being neutral does n't mean we stop trading .

  had no idea they had so varying traditions within poland .

  sure , i guess the german guy/girl dont wan na take the national socialist denial discussion today ... although i doubt the rest of europe think its `` just a stupied discussion '' that we should forget ... europe will never forget what the german national socialists did ... 
  of course  is it good that the swedish press is kept under control by the state to a certain degree ? 
  just because sweden is n't perfect does n't mean that other countries in europe should strive to make the mistakes sweden has made , right ? 
  sure the national socialist were n't socialist ... . 
  state control of media is bad . 
  you are right . 
  a member of the warsawa pact, 
  i promise i am not stefan l\u00f6fven ( the swedish pm ) . 
  just because i am swedish does n't mean i agree with the socialist government . 
   do you agree with every polish politican ? 
   right-wing governments communist parties are n't much better . 
   so maybe not everything is lost yet . 
  except the swedish welfare state will be broken permantely within 2 years according to a leftish economist ( so no bias here since he supports the current government ) if the current trends continue . 
  so i think we are pretty screwed . 
  yup , i believe in you guys . 
  i think polish people wo n't tolare this for too long . 
  still many former sovjet states that did n't embrace liberty and a market based system to the same extent as poland did . 
  umm ... what ? 
  i was talking about poland and not sweden . 
  do i think that the socialist goverment in sweden is awesome ? 
  does it have anything to do with poland ? 
   at this point probably more so than even the hungarian government . 
  in what way ? 
  hey ... not every swede supports the crazy socialists policies ... heck thats why i am sad because poland seems like a perfect country to move to when sweden collapses . 
  compared to other former sovjet countries . 
  is poland a better place today than in 1989 ? 
  yes . 
  is it perfect ? 
  no , but it has moved in the right direction . 
  out of all former parts of sovjet poland is one of the ones that made most progress . 
  nah , do n't be too sad . 
  all of europe is going crazy . 
  all you have to do is being less crazy than everyone else and you will be fine . 
  poland into space ? 
   nazis come on . 
  they are not national socialists . 
  they might be a bit nationalistic but they are hardly hardcore national socialist \u00e1 la german style . 
  too be fair uk and polands history is pretty different . 
  poland always ends up getting screwed by everyone else to the west and the east while uk ( excluding your weird colonies ) has never been occupied in modern time . 
  so its not that weird they have some trust issues . 
  come on poland :( you were heading is such a great direction . 
  1 ) exactly which eu instrument are you refering to ? 
  2 ) it 's totally irrelevant . 
  sweden can say : `` we give zero benefits to immigrants '' . 
  there is no need to provide them with anything ( above perhaps the most basic food initially ) at all according to international agreements ( including eu legislation ) . 
  there is no right to stay after the conflict in the country is over and you no longer count as a refugee . 
  if sweden implemented those rules we would have the same amount of immigrants as poland ( no benefits there etc so no refugees go there ), 
   the government has already used most of the options it reasonably has available at this point in time at a national level . 
  no , they have n't . 
  if sweden changed it laws to say that refugees that have right according to the un treaties can stay here ( excludes anyone who has lived in a un refugee camp ) until the conflicts are over and then they are sent back but they have no right to welfare benefits . 
  then the flow would stop . 
  there is a reason they choose sweden and germany instead of slovenia , slovakia , etc : because there welfare is higher here . 
  there is no war in any other european conflict so if all they want is peace they would go to other countries that are closer . 
   anyway i 'm fairly convinced we 'll see quite a bit lower but still high numbers during 2016 . 
  guess we will see and i guess it depends if the left goverment goes through and actually tries to decrease immigration . 
  guess we will see whether you will be right or not  the biggest change is though that eu politicans ( including swedish ) are now employing the help of the not so democratic leader of turkey and giving him money to make sure no refugees can leave his country . 
  this week . 
  it was a couple of weeks ago . 
  do you think it will be more or less when it gets warm again in the spring ? 
  at least then it was n't really volentary, 
   would be very politically `` brave '' yea , and thats why it wo n't happen . 
  sorry , was 2 years and not 1.5 years . 
  and bear in mind that it is an economist that has earlier agrued for a generaous immigration policy . 
   that 's really not enough reason for a billion euro project . 
  but the bulk of the cost isnt paid by the us . 
  its paid by the eu . 
  of course the us wants to be able to use it too . 
   ban the use of gps and galileo for ` security reasons ' , china ca n't `` ban '' the use of it for the us or eu . 
  they can try to jam it or fake the signals ( which is why you want to have a reserve system like galileo if they jam gps ), 
   prc which country ? 
  they could easily change the laws letting them work . 
  probably . 
  there is a reason they walk all the way from turkey that is secure and they have more in common with . 
  its basic economics . 
  if there is no reward for coming to the north they wo n't come : why leave muslim , warm turkey for the secular cold nordic if you dont benefit economically ? 
  they will have to do it . 
  according to projections the swedish welfare state will collapse ** permanently ** if the current rates of immigration is sustained for 1.5 years more . 
  the swedish priminister recently said after the paris attacks '' ** we ** have been naive '' . 
  of course he is n't going to say that he has been naive but that `` we '' as a people have been . 
  probably if someone destorys/damges/hacks the gps system they can switch to galilio, 
   why treat refugees differently ? 
  eu laws demand that they give fingerprints , and there is nothing wrong with that . 
  because politicans are scared of coming across as `` inhumane '' and rather let people break the law than being acused of being racist . 
   homework right because the illiterate syrian farmers are probably going to do a great job with that haha =p, 
  the law can always be changed . 
  and stop tempting them with promises of welfare etc. 
  if we said : `` sure , come here but you wo n't get any welfare at all so that if you do n't get a job you will starv to death '' there would be a big decrease . 
  do you boycott everything from marocco ? 
  true . 
  it 's simple . 
  just ask : what would either side do if they had the military capacity to exterminate the other side ? 
  israel : they have that capacity already . 
  they could kill every palestinian within days if they wanted . 
  they restrict their use of a violence though . 
  hamas : they have said they would kill every jew in israel and around the world if they could . 
  it 's even in their rules that all jews shall be killed . 
  if they had the capacity to kill all jews they would .

yes , it could be worse . 
  but is that really good enough to justify anything ? 
  and how much do refugees get in jordan , in terms of welfare , housing , education etc , and who pays for that ? 
  sure , 120 thousand refugees are nothing , sweden 's share ( about 5k if i got it right ) will not even make a dent in the overall situation . 
  but is it a one time thing ? 
  what will happen with the poor bastards aiming for germany/denmark/sweden etc but ending up in romania ? 
  i do n't see how this situation is sustainable for the eu or any of the member nations . 
  only good thing is it may eventually lead to the end of the eu , so i shall look on the bright side . 
  i know it sucked , but how is that different from yours ? 
  the actual number is the only relevant thing , adding `` it 's only x % of total '' makes it an idiotic argument , which was my whole point . 
   120.000 is less than 0.5 % of the total refugees out of syria so calm your fucking tits i guess denmark could handle 35 million immigrants , it 's only 0,5 % of the world 's population ... 
  i 'm sure they do . 
  or attempt to . 
  if they are anything like sweden they fail completely . 
  at least 90 % does n't have any identification . 
  that does n't stop sweden from handing out residence permits ( permanent ones , too ) like it 's candy . 
  and if you somehow get a deportation ruling against you , since we do n't know who you are , you will not be deported anywhere ... 
  even in those few cases where deportation is possible , activists and media ( in sweden those two are pretty much synonymous ) will protest until the authorities give up and makes another exception . 
  so we do n't actually know who we let in . 
  but we make an attempt to find out !, 
  sorry , it was sarcastic . 
  could have been a line from any of our media-elite though , including our public service ( supposedly neutral ) tv/radio . 
  it is of course a huge burden , but if sweden and germany invites them over , we can deal with the consequences ourselves . 
  no need to fuck over the rest of our neighbors . 
  how racist . 
  refugees are n't a weight to be carried . 
  it 's beneficial financially , socially and culturally so why the hell should the rest of europe/eu get to share our immigrants ? 
  we had one called svenskarnas parti in the elections 2014 . 
  they got a couple of thousands votes and discontinued their party soon after . 
  i 'm sure there 's a couple even smaller parties or new ones for the next election , but i do n't see an actual far-right party getting votes in sweden . 
  it 's hard enough to get people to consider voting sd . 
  as a fellow leftist ( former mp-voter , our green party ) sd is the only party that has politics compatible with left ideals . 
  how are we supposed to have a generous welfare state when we have 10 million citizens ( most of whom are n't net contributors financially ) in a world with billions of poor people ? 
  we should use whatever means we can spare to try and make the rest of the world a better place , not borrow cash to make our own land as shitty as most others . 
  germany and sweden should split it 50/50 . 
   i do n't understand why mandatory quotas are n't forced onto countries . 
  i do n't understand why spain are n't forced to take all refugees by themselves . 
  oh , you probably would n't like being forced to do something you did n't agree to . 
  it 's fair because that 's the deal all involved parties signed on to . 
  how would it be fair to suddenly alter the deal ( without them consenting to it ) these countries have ? 
  unfrenchify them and then toss their asses out . 
  yeah yeah , against the rules . 
  but rules can change . 
  i 'm terrified you might not leave . 
  if you do n't , there 's no way we will even consider it and we 'll go down with the ship . 
  if you do leave and we see how nicely it turns out for you , we may just follow your example . 
  ca n't we have both please ? 
  our former prime minister ( fredrik reinfeldt ) has flown over sweden and he saw plenty of empty land and forests . 
  we have room !, 
  i 'm guessing our current leader has flown over finland and made the decision that you also have room , and need the cultural/social/economical enrichment . 
  we are just trying to help you !, 
   `` the german willingness to help may not be overused . 
  burdens have to be distributed within the eu says the german minister of the interior at a press conference in berlin . 
  so , hints of a limit to german willingness to help ... `` burden '' ... 
  trying to get other nations to bear germany 's `` burden '' ... what the hell ? 
  sweden will not stand for such intolerance . 
  we will have to invade you and take control before history repeats itself . 
  having a limit is racinazifascist , the germans are at it again . 
  you could learn a thing or 5 from us swedes . 
  i 'm more interested in finding out why , despite planned increased revenue from raised taxes , as well as our economically beneficial mass immigration , our finance minister is considering borrowing money from the european investment bank specifically for the reception of asylum seekers . 
  allowing germany/sweden/austria etc. 
  to set their immigration policy will very soon cost them more than 2 % of gdp , not counting social/cultural costs . 
  i hope they have more brains than we do . 
  i agree 100 % . 
  but if we elect people that act irresponsibly , it 's our problem . 
  begging other countries to fuck themselves over because we did and now we sort of regret it ( but ca n't actually say it out loud , our media would crucify a single step in the `` wrong '' direction ) is disgraceful . 
  i ca n't stand the hypocrisy . 
  we made our bed . 
  we get a new chance 2018 . 
  sweden is acting disgraceful , pretending to be `` the humanitarian super-power '' and welcoming to all in need but doing everything to keep the numbers from rising even further . 
  denmark should not let refugees through to sweden , but as you say , sweden to finland go ahead . 
  we keep giving strong incentives to cross the mediterranean sea at any cost , then whine when people inevitably drown . 
  and then , to top it all off , we expect the rest of eu to `` take their share '' even though it 's apparently `` extremely beneficial '' for the swedish society/economy to accept refugees , regardless of numbers ( numbers are racist , to even hint at 500k , as some german did the other day , as some kind of limit for sustainable asylum applications would in sweden result in a huge outrage ) . 
  we have insane and/or incompetent leadership . 
  i am ashamed . 
  sorry neighbours . 
  will cameron cancel the plans for the brexit referendum now that the conservatives have already won the next election ? 
  do n't put it all on merkel/germany . 
  sweden is even worse and has been at it for a while already . 
  yeah , merkel is a bigger voice in the world/eu , but we compensate by being twice as stupid . 
  yes , but since i would be extremely devastated if a couple of hundred ( i do n't actually know how many , just pulling a number out of my ass ) football-players would suddenly need a work visa i am taking a personal interest in the matter and will now go to your mighty fine island and start up an anti-farage campaign . 
  well then , with so much at stake i am now a devout believer in the eu-project . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb81/eb81_publ_en.pdf page 152 . 
  the 3 most skeptical ( towards federation ) countries in the eu is not having a referendum on it . 
   so , i guess what i 'm asking is -- why always britain ? 
  why is it britain that has always been reluctant about european integration and is now even going to vote on leaving the eu , and not france or sweden or austria ? 
  is it just a cultural thing ? 
  http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb81/eb81_publ_en.pdf page 152 is particularly interesting . 
  norway and iceland is n't even in the eu , and the rest of the nordics are much more negative towards the ultimate integration step of federalization than the brits . 
  pages 139 , 141 , 144 , 145 are also interesting . 
  edit : what i 'm trying to say is there 's plenty ( a super majority even ) of swedes who do not want a federation . 
  or more decisions taken on eu-level . 
  or the euro . 
  or common foreign policy . 
  but out politicians and our media wants that . 
  so the debate is dead . 
  they are just slowly getting on with the process even though we do n't want it , just hoping we will be tied in completely before anyone notices . 
  yes , that happens . 
  and much more . 
  he makes great money if he pays that much in taxes .

  either way very nice job with the list , schweiz and iceland probably has the most upvoted pictures of any european country , so it 's not like yours were bad . 
   a coat of arms , yes . 
  but a flag ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  i think almost all of these are just the coat of arms put onto a flag . 
  unemployment is only low compared to the last decade or so . 
  and it is still very high in certain groups , immigrants for example . 
  or in certain regions , like anywhere outside of the big cities . 
  combined with the housing shortage it screws up the life of a lot of people . 
   we are building more then in decades . 
  does n't change the fact that we have one of the most fucked up housing situations in the world . 
   schools results are improving . 
  in some cases dramatically . 
  and so on . 
  but we still do n't have any teachers , and that does not seem to be improving . 
   the good stuff just dont get any attention , and the ( often fake ) negative are spammed over and over . 
  but a lot of people also just ignore the real negative stuff even though it 's spammed . 
  and really , how much is actually written about the housing shortage for example ? 
  that is a huge issue but it seems like no one really wants to deal with it , basically thinking we can build us out of it , which we are n't anywhere close to doing even if we are building a lot . 
  every country has a bunch of problems though , sweden is n't unique in that . 
  but my impression is that most swedes way overestimate how well our society actually is doing . 
  not thinking we are perfect of course , but definitely better than a lot of other countries who in reality are doing just about as well as us but with a smaller economy or something like that . 
  we have had a headstart , that 's the main thing that 's good about swedens situation . 
  yeah , of course things are going to have to be renegotiated , that 's sort of the point of the whole thing . 
  but it 's not like it 's going to be a huge deal if it has worked this far there is clearly a solution to it . 
  iirc you can set it to a specific number/interval and it will automatically adjust the length to that . 
  what 's your point ? 
   cyprus is one of the cradles of civilisation and as such belongs to the whites and not to t * rks lol, 
  someone uses . 
  as thousand separators ( or whatever it 's called ) . 
  and they probably made the map somewhat hastily and just pasted the scale on there without adjusting it to show better numbers . 
  could be an assignment for a gis class or something . 
  we had to have a scale and a north arrow for the map to be approved , so normally it ended up looking something like that . 
  also everything very much looks like the default settings on arc or qgis or something , so yeah . 
  the uk is already not in schengen , so do n't see how that matters . 
  and i do n't think market access is a huge deal for a small military base in cyprus . 
   serious question you could try reading the article ... 
  i mean yes we are not `` running into the bottom '' . 
  but we have fairly big problems with several of the most important parts of our society . 
  housing availability/prices , healthcare , schools , police , unemployment , inequality . 
  i think all those things have at least at some point been working better than they are right now . 
  the reason we are among the top countries on a bunch of lists and stuff is because we used to be at the absolute top . 
  the rest of the world is catching up though , and might pass us if we do nothing . 
  i do n't see how it 's related to terrorism though , like barachiel claimed . 
  well there was that one time when our foreign minister told them they were basically stuck in the middle ages in regards to freedoms equality and that stuff . 
  they got a bit mad but i think everything went back to normal after a while . 
  but does n't it really mean the same thing all the time ? 
  like when using it ironically , you put a word in quotation marks because that 's what a person ( real or fictional ) would say , not what you personally mean with it . 
  same in the `` signaling unusual usage '' case , the word is not actually correct there ( and you know it ) , it 's more of a saying or figure of speech or something like that , so you put that as a quote . 
  at least that 's how i see it , and never really have problems understanding what it means . 
  yes , of course . 
  it can be used in a bunch of different ways . 
  but the only information it actually gives in all those cases is that it is a quote . 
  the rest is about context and interpretation . 
  as far as i know the symbol means the same thing everywhere , there might just be certain ways in which it is more commonly used in certain countries . 
   would it be a good army though ? 
  almost certainly more efficient and better than 28 separate armies trying to work together . 
  the difficulty lies in how and when to use it , as the separate eu countries have vastly different philosophies on that topic . 
   what language would we speak ? 
  your own , or if you need to communicate with someone who does n't speak your language you use english . 
  working with foreigners is hardly a new concept you know ... basically , to reach up in the ranks you would need to know english , but just for basic people on the ground i 'm pretty sure you would still work together with people from your country in most cases . 
  but it depends on how it is organised . 
   how much would each country contribute ? 
  that 's up for debate . 
   which country would lead this army ? 
  the eu . 
   what if france wants to do something with a few thousand troops but germany is against it ? 
  same way it works with other decisions by other eu organisations . 
  with an actual unified army there would no longer be a german or french army , there would only be a european army , and france or germany would not have any special powers over any parts of the army , and to use it would require the eu whichever-part-of-it-that-handles-these-things to approve it , so it would indirectly had to be approved by x number of countries or mps or whatever ( possibly by every country , which would be a hindrance for it to actually achieve anything , but may not be a bad thing ) . 
   would we increase our spending ? 
  what the article says ( i 'm pretty sure ) is that to maintain a similar strength army would save us a lot of money . 
  so whether we save that money or make a better army for the same price is up to us . 
  ( or even increase spending and get an even better/bigger one , unlikely )  i think it 's a brilliant idea if the questions above are answered for . 
  there are answers , but not everyone likes them . 
  i 'm very unsure about this myself . 
  for me the biggest question is how the use of this army would be limited , the purpose of it . 
  very strictly as a defense of the eu i 'm definitely for it , but when it comes to international missions and stuff ( like a potential intervention in syria for example ) i 'm very uncertain , not sure if i 'm willing to give up sweden 's sovereignty on that topic . 
   it 's a weird anglo press mannerism . 
  it means it 's a direct quote . 
   to us non-english speaking persons it means that the author is distancing himself from some statement , or that it is not mean seriously . 
  that is one way to interpret a quote . 
  but the symbols themselves does not carry that meaning , they just tell us it 's a quote . 
  it 's possible the english press uses it more freely without putting the quote in as much context , but i do n't really notice it so ca n't tell either way really . 
  in sweden foreign born people do have significantly more kids than native swedes . 
  like 0,3 children difference or something like that ( look it up at scb.se if you want exact numbers ) . 
  but we do n't keep regular statistics on skin colour/ethnicity/religion / other subjective things , so ca n't answer that part of the question . 
  and swedish , unsurprisingly . 
  some we are more logical ( imo ) , `` ear hangers '' , `` toilet ring '' ( duh ) , `` river horse '' . 
  but then we come to sandwich which is `` butter goose '' , ca n't really explain that one ... 
  although you can call it `` macka '' instead if you want , but not sure if that 's better , it 's a romani loanword of all things . 
  maybe it 's higher than i thought , most thing i 've done has been just above 100kr/hour , which is about 11 $ , assumed some things ( like restaurant work ) got worse pay than that , but maybe that is the lower end . 
  granted , it has probably risen a bit the last 3-4 years since i did any work like that , did n't think about that either . 
  no , but union membership is very high . 
  if a company ends up not following agreements by not hiring unionised workers for example it can end up with all the other unions boycotting them anyway , famous example is how they forced [ toys r us ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/03/18/sweden-retail-unions_n_6888328.html ) to follow the agreements by blocking them from transport , banking and that sort of thing . 
   when toys `` r '' us refused to back down , transport workers stopped deliveries to the stores , warehouse workers would n't handle shipments bound for their stores and bank employees refused to process transactions for the company . 
  they stopped toys `` r '' us from advertising in the local press , and swedish blue - and white-collar workers ' unions encouraged their 2.5 million members not to shop there . 
  but there are still certain jobs were there is n't much policing from the unions . 
  like small businesses or new jobs that does n't fit into the previous structure or whatever ( foodora is a current example i think ) . 
  the swedish numbers include some taxes , it 's about 30 % that gets payed before the employee even sees the money . 
  but then we also have maybe another 30 % `` normal '' taxes on top of that , depending on a lot of things , the more you earn the higher % you pay .

  also , the nuclear power plants we have now are far far safer than tjernoby , just like you said . 
  i just think it is madness to do what germany is doing ( and denmark ) , reject nuclear power to increase the number of deaths and add to climate change , just because nuclear power is bad . 
  i do n't think it is in comparison to coal . 
  sure , in an perfect world our houses would a be heated with renewable energy and love and peace would reign , but until that day , i 'll take the least bad alternative . 
  nuclear is less bad than coal . 
  where does the faroe islands get their energy from ? 
   i 've gotten the impression that things are better now and that the finns are a much better-liked minority . 
  probably , due to many reasons . 
  we have gotten new minorities to dislike :-) , and the finns who comes now are generally better behaved . 
  i also think any of the old alcoholics are dying out , but it is still seen ( according to my relative who is a judge , and a friend who is training to be one ) and can be found in the statistics if one look . 
   i also remember reading that at some point a lot of the bums in stockholm were finnish alcoholics probably , would n't suprise me , but i guess those who came over in the 60 's and 70 's are starting to die off now ( if they drink ) . 
   we 're more focused on the standard story that finns went there , worked their way up and assimilated eventually ( with a few hitches here and there ) . 
  i mean , to a large extent that is true . 
  most finns assimilated and obviously did n't have the knife fights/alcoholism problems . 
  nor can i ever recall real rasism against finns , more like bloody finn , like perhaps someone said `` bloody redhead '' , not really insulting and certainly nothing someone of finnish origin cared about . 
  there were more who drank however and it was more than the swedish population . 
  i just wondered it was talked about , since as you say , one has the half jokingly , stereotype of an alcoholic finn here . 
  i do n't really mean that most people see finns that way , it is more of a joke , like you make jokes about us , but there is some truth behind it and most people are aware of it . 
  sidenote to that , i do n't know if you have heard about [ susanna alakoski ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/susanna_alakoski ) but she wrote a widely praised book svinal\u00e4ngorna ( was also made into a movie with noomi rapace ) about growing up in a finnish alcoholic family , in ystad sweden . 
  i like her and i really recommend her books , but i do not always agree with her and her political views . 
  she always blames poverty , but ca n't seem to see that the poverty she experienced was due to her parents being alcoholics , not due to the fact that they were not paid ( i mean , in the 70 's , one could live a decent life at least with two parents working in a factory . 
  not expensive handbags perhaps , but a decent life ) . 
  however , i like how she writes and i do n't always have to agree with someone 100 % to like their writing . 
  who knows , it might broaden my perspective :-) . 
  she has also written a book about having a brother in prison ( her brother became a criminal ) and a diary how poverty/alcoholism affects you as an adult , even if one as `` got away '' , as she did . 
  this post ballooned a little bit in the process , sorry . 
  no , i thought it was an interesting read , thanks . 
  yes , of course , but that is not shorts . 
  i have never seen it , if one exclude my very niece who dressed herself and had dress , skirt and pants . . it is sort of cute when you are around 3 though :-) . 
  maybe it is a girls things , to be overly anal about it , but i 've honestly never seen it , and i imagine it would be uncomfortable and bulky . 
  have you ever seen a woman wear shorts and skirts together outside of school ? 
  i suppose if you do it in april or something it is not to hot , but i still think it is a very localised custom . 
  is skype american ? 
  is he the one who believe we are all ruled by lizards ? 
  where did you go to school ? 
  i have never heard about it , honestly . 
  have you ever seen it outside of school ? 
  in an office , in the street etc ? 
  i think it must have been a local trend . 
  we do n't really have school uniforms , but if we had , i can not see the school forcing girls to wear skirts in the winter , it is to cold . 
  really ? 
  i thought the average finn drank more , but i could be wrong of course , has happened before . 
  we do ? 
  honestly , i do n't know anyone who does that , never even heard about it . 
  a huge bonus with skirts is that they are cooler than shorts . 
  that disappears if you wear both . 
  if it is cooler outside you wear a coat , suffer or thicker stockings . 
  also , another reason one would never wear shorts with skirts is that it would be far to bulky / the skirt would n't fall in a nice way . 
  even the non tight skirts has to be somewhat tight around the hips out of necessity , and a pair of shorts would make the waist so weird . 
  and , my butt would look to big !, 
  [ norwegian ] ( http://www.norwegian.com/uk/ ) and sas, 
   sing-songy language , that is what i am referring to . 
  what you say is true of course , it is a brother/friendly relationship . 
   manly men with vodka in sweden , the finns are overrepresented in alcohol related stuff , everything from murders , fighting , etc. 
  is that talked about in finland , or known ? 
  would n't mind that at all, 
  hopefully it will spill over , just like women 's rights . 
  it really does seems like gay rights will be the thing of the 21st century . 
  i hope it is . 
   having said that , he was always a cabinet member in governments that continuously improved malta 's respect for gay rights and especially women 's rights ( bringing us inline with eu law ) . 
  that was a requirement , he had too . 
   tonio borg was in a cabinet that removed the requirement for a husband 's signature . 
  what he seems to do and what he believes seem to be oddly compartmentalised . 
  i am sorry , but that is so fucked up that i ca n't even comprehend it . 
  it seems like claiming that a saudi prince is a female rights activist if he claims that women should be able to drive and ride a bike . 
  he is not , at all , on the side of women and gays , he is an extremely conservative catholic to everyone but the maltese population who sadly , seems to care little about those things . 
  maybe he is a step forward compared to other maltese politicians , but to the rest of europe he seems to come from the 50 's . 
   ( in malta that 's not uncommon - the most laissez-faire catholics in the world ) . 
  no , then you would have more female rights , abortions etc , like austria , spain and other countries . 
  if you were , people would ignore the church and think for themselves . 
  but perhaps you mean that you are very good a doing one thing and saying another . 
  that is always something that i have a problem with in catholic countries . 
  to me it is hypocracy , and unnecessary hypocracy at that ( i mean , we are not talking dictatorship here - if one does n't agree with the church , tell them so and leave ) . 
  i have never understand why peopel choose hypocracy when one do not have to . 
  however , to me a lot of people in spain , italy , ireland etc seems to ignore the church , a lot . 
  why not malta ? 
  or is perhaps the younger generation starting to ? 
   as regards the rest of the population - acceptance of gay rights seems to be growing exponentially , which is good to see although the current government is also against same-sex marriage . 
  it 's been good to see more of the lgbt community get into the spotlight - it was n't the case 10 years ago the 21st century really seems to be the lbgt century . 
  good . 
  i hope the eu will force gay marriages up on the agenda . 
   i 'm one of the few people i know who is unreservedly in pro-choice , so i 've had debates with women where i a i truly hate debating with pro lifers , apart from being fairly ignorant , they can never stay on the topic without calling names . 
  you seem normal and nice so it must be really frustrating living in what seems to be such a extremely conservative community to me . 
  i hope it will change . 
  i do n't see a way out of it and it pisses me off . 
  me too . 
  i truly hope this becomes a big thing in the eu and the maltese have to explain themselves . 
   i ca n't explain it . 
  i hate the idea of killing endangered birds , but unfortunately it happens regularly . 
  i can understand that it must be frustrating , but what i find so weird is that is seems to have popular support . 
  i mean , we are not talking about a few bad apples - everybody has those , we are talking about huge chunks of the population . 
  that is also why i hope it draws more international attention , i hope/guess that the maltese wo n't like being known as a population of bird killers , or perhaps they do n't mind ? 
  ok , sorry then , i mixed them up . 
  so , borg is the asshole who hates gay , abortions and women - dalli is the corrupt asshole . 
  why ca n't you send none assholes ? 
  does the population of malta hates gays , women and birds ? 
   well there 's a very loud part of the maltese population that love to kill birds . 
  why ? 
  also , i have a lot of hunters in my family , but to kill * endagered * birds , is not proper hunting , it is proper being a complete idiotic asshole . 
  do these people support the killing of rhinos and elephants too ?

  fuck the experts and everyone who lives in london or is young , brown , reads the guardian , has a uni education , has a passport , likes veganism , has a bike , likes renewable energy , is gay , feminist , reads statistics ... did i forget anyone ? 
  well , if i did , rest assured , * fuck you * too !, 
   who has consistently afaik held the position that immigration should remain free that is a total lie . 
  he has consistently campaigned on a australian-style point system . 
  what he * did * say is that some eu migration would always be there , but that is compatible with a point-based system where you pick and choose those you want . 
  after all , skilled eu migrants would still come . 
  what we 're seeing here is a massive backtrack , now he 's opening the door to continued free access to all of eu , which is the direct opposite of what he campaigned against . 
  nice try , though . 
   you should go see a doctor . 
  are you lashing out now because you 're arguing against a straw man and i called you out on it ? 
  i 'm not going to go into a mudfight with someone who has a failing temper . 
   you forget the statements you wrote 1 hour ago . 
  more like you need to read better ? 
   and you dare play the intellectually dishonest card . 
  yes , how * dare * i ask people to represent my arguments correctly . 
  the cheek !, 
   you fucking said it , own up to it . 
  you 're right tough guy , i did say what i said . 
  the problem is that you have n't understood any of it . 
  what ? 
  did you even read my previous comment ? 
  you 're making so many deceitful straw man arguments here it 's crazy . 
   the danish  their language sounds as people talking with the mouth full of potatos you touch my erogenous zones with such effortless ease . 
  til : looking at data and considering facts is * literally communism * . 
  can you spell anti-intellectualism ? 
   so lets make a fiscal union . 
  i 'm all for it . 
  but considering how [ hostile your country is ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/06/07/euroskepticism-beyond-brexit/pm_2016-06-07_brexit-01/ ) , i 'm not sure your people are on board . 
   if you want to restrict foreign workers on your territory nah , i 'm not in favour of a general restriction . 
  i would consider a partial re-orientation of labour mobility from poor & old nations in the east who suffer from serious de-population . 
  the goal here is n't to insulate sweden , eu workers contribute a lot to our economy , but to protect the poorer eu countries . 
  if they had a tfr of 2.5 or above , it would n't have made much difference , because they can just replace those people . 
  but many of those in the east have a tfr of 1.2 to 1.4 that is extremely low and crippling if you add mass-scale emigration on top of it . 
  you seem unable to understand the difference between the special circumstances of the `` old and poor '' countries and a general principle , of which i am in favour . 
  i do n't think this is a black/white position . 
  the czechs never had major population emigration , though , because they started at a very high level ( however their post-fsu performance was mediocre so they did n't catch up very fast ) . 
  i 've seen that point about the baltics , but why take chances ? 
  they need demographic support and considering that they are small countries with a particular culture , it makes sense to repatriate some of the emigrants . 
  i fully concede that most are gone forever , but maybe a couple tens of thousands could be enough . 
  a few points . 
   only marxists think i 'm not a marxist . 
   no need to address points that are made on patently absurd purely marxist principles this is your way of saying that you 're too lazy to do the effort to actually read the studies on american election demographics . 
   it 's enough to simply debunk the underlying basis , as i have done , as that demolished the points . 
  nice work there patting yourself on the back for no reason whatsoever . 
  i 'll just close with this : the gop share of the black vote has held fairly constant for 10 running election . 
  the same is true of the hispanic vote . 
  only really the asian vote has moved in the last few decades to being only 25-30 % gop . 
  and even then , the movement from election to election is not more than 5-10 % . 
  these shifts take a lot of time . 
  you could , of course , study the last 10 elections and make informed commentary . 
  or you could take your current approach , which is to reject all data and yap about `` marxist principles '' which makes no sense whatsoever . 
  you 've made clear which approach you prefer and i think it is fruitless to engage you further as you seem mentally hostile to look at data that contradicts your world view . 
  it 's a nonsensical comparison . 
  sweden as a whole does n't lose 30 % of its population by internal migration . 
  sweden is a fiscal union between territories , the eu is not . 
  if the eu was a fiscal/political union , i would n't have cared if lithuania lost 30 % of its population simply because everyone shares the same budget and there would be far stronger mechanisms in place than there are today to plug the fiscal gap to depopulation areas . 
  since those mechanisms are not in place between eu nations but exist * within * them , to compare the two is fundamentally naive . 
  you completely dodged all major points i 've made . 
  you 're linking the brexit vote , where the demographics are near 90 % white people , with an electorate which has 40 % minorities . 
  until and unless you accept that this makes the two uncomparable , you 're not going to get why trump will fail . 
  basically , all your arguments boil down to wishful thinking that somehow the brexit vote will translate into a trump win , it 's fantastically ignorant of the demographics of the american electorate and just exposes that you 've never researched the topic . 
  gni per capita corrects for that , and your 2015 numbers are not wildly different than your gdp numbers . 
  i do n't find new yorker exceptional by any standard , even if it has a decent quality . 
  paying that sum just for cartoons is pretty daft from an economic viewpoint . 
  wait , is it my turn to use ** bolded ** words to replace logic with emphasis now ? 
  yeah , it 's truly ironic . 
  it would help the poorer eu nations even more because the net contributions would be largely the same but now wales does n't get any eu funds , so more to eastern europe . 
  to be frank , i would n't be against some limitations on labour from ee to richer western nations . 
  lithuania for instance has lost 30 % of its population due to emigration . 
  that is not good by any measure and they could use some ( partial ) reverse labour inflows . 
  brilliant cover , although largely irrelevant . 
  major leave figures are now backtracking faster than the speed of light and are pushing openly for eea access and are admitting that eu movement may not end . 
  speaking of which , the new yorker is probably one of the last major magazines which does these ( high-quality ) colored covers . 
  i wish more would chip in to preserve this tradition . 
  damn those experts , they keep popping up !, 
  no , it is nonsense . 
  the stock market = / = uk economy . 
  also , the value of the pound should be seen from a longer perspective . 
  it 's one-day drop was large , but its absolute value is still within the historical norm . 
  `` we 're tired of the experts '', 
  canada 's housing market is dogshit , too , though and their tuition fees are rising fast . 
  thinking about it , only really germany has a good housing market of the major developed nations today , without having a bad economy . 
  ukip has slowly transformed itself into the enp - english nationalist party - anyway . 
  now that scotland is leaving the union to join the eu , enp+t ory will rule england and wales with a rump labour party for the spoils . 
  not a good outcome . 
   who cares about food and money you 're not fooling anyone , greece , they are not turning into you , 
  ah , the fallacy of `` the educated will look out best for the nation '' . 
  not really . 
  the educated will look out for the educated and well-to-do , just like the poor will look after the interests of the poor . 
  people are selfish , regardless of educational status . 
  the only thing that cartoon reveals is the smug attitude of some that they are more equal than others , by serving up an idiotic child-like example with more relevance in a children 's book than in the real world as a way to pat themselves on the back . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/21/michael-gove-compares-experts-warning-against-brexit-to-nazis-wh/ ), 
  obviously a speculative/anecdotal question , but what 's your general sense for reunification in ireland ? 
  caution or outright resistance among people ? 
  what ( realistic ) steps should ni take in order to boost the chances of them being taken in ? 
  and given the prospect of a tory-dominated , pro-austerity england/wales , they are not wrong . 
  why would n't they want to share a nation with [ these geniuses ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqrg7wh_fc0 ) ? 
  ( backstory : crazed brexiteer tries to burn up eu flag , ca n't because of corrupt eu regulations preventing flammable material in flags ) . 
  poland is the most pro-eu country in the entire union though ( via pew polls ) . 
  sure , money helps , but the notion that you have a big eurosceptic feeling in the nation like the uk , nl or france is just delusional .

  really smart and passionate people . 
  when i got a bit older but was still in school i also got a bunch of turkish school mates . 
  still to this day ( 10 + years after we graduated ) get some valuable perspective on stuff that happens in turkey thanks to at least one friend i still keep in touch with on facebook . 
  so i have a hard time seeing what people are saying when they are scared of arabs/middle easterners/muslims , because my experience with them has been rather wonderful . 
  that 's not to say that there are n't practices over there that i do n't agree with - there are a lot of them - but i know for a fact that people from the region can integrate well and hold swedish values as their own . 
  i respect people reclaiming slurs and stuff like that , but i would have a very hard time using it even if i knew someone i was speaking to or of was okay with it . 
  it was a really bad word when i grew up . 
   franzmann so that 's an insult in german ? 
  `` fransm\u00e4n '' is just how we refer to french people in swedish . 
  yeah , we do have the same expression in swedish , but coming up with danish jabs is too much fun just to give up simply because it might indicate some kind of - * shudders * - brotherly love . 
  finnish has some of the best expressions i know . 
  whenever a similar question is asked , you always learn some new one that is just majestic . 
  who was esther ? 
  the moomin one is really cute as well . 
  i feel like we have something similar , but i ca n't remember what it is exactly . 
  hahaha , i remember first hearing about that when some us media picked up the phrase and went all `` whuuut ? '' . 
  well , except for the ones who went `` makes perfect sense . '', 
  oh man , i love that one . 
   \u041a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0443 \u0443 \u045f\u0430\u043a\u0443 '' - '' buy a cat in sack '' , buying things without previously inspecting them interesting !, 
  we have `` k\u00f6pa grisen i s\u00e4cken '' , which means `` buying the pig in the sack '' . 
  apparently the saying comes from sneaky people in the middle ages selling cats ( or rats ) in sacks while claiming they were piglets . 
  kinda fun to see your expression being about what was actually in the sack and ours being about what people thought was there . 
  i do n't think you should act intentionally ignorant . 
  that just lessening yourself . 
  it 's perfectly possible to be both informed about something and unwilling to talk about it at length , and i think that 's the best stance to take . 
  hopefully people back off when you say that you do n't want to talk about something . 
  it 's certainly a boundary that * should * be respected . 
  i see what you 're saying and it 's not a phrase that i think i 've ever seen used in sweden , but i * have * seen a lot of dutch people here referring to ( i think ) indonesians as a model minority in the netherlands . 
  so it does exist to at least some degree in europe . 
  the rest of your comment is pretty spot-on , though . 
  not really . 
  you mostly hear about other countries when 1 ) there 's an election , 2 ) something bad happens ( be it a terrorist attack , an accident or for example a flooding ) , or 3 ) something significantly happens politically , good or bad . 
  germany * finally * legalizing same sex marriage was a news story , and russia struggling on that front has been news as well . 
  but unless something exceptional like the examples above happens , we do n't really get daily news from any other country . 
   like , remember that scene from matrix movie , where neo is shot at by the agents and the bullets slow down and stop in the air ? 
  he picks one , looks at it and it 's written `` made in estonia '' on the bullet . 
  my god , that 's a beautiful , wonderful joke . 
  danskj\u00e4vlar is the one that comes to mind - danish devils . 
  when i grew up in the 90 's `` svartskalle '' was a rather common slur as well . 
  it means `` black head '' and while it can refer to black people i mostly saw it directed at southern european/black-haired non-nordic people . 
  it was a long time since i saw someone use it , though . 
  good riddance , i say . 
  unlike the jab at the danes - which is all in good fun - `` svartskalle '' was an actual real slur used by proper assholes . 
  haha . 
  we have basically the same word for danes : * danskj\u00e4vlar * , meaning danish devils . 
  you can have `` svensk '' as a surname , meaning `` swedish '' , but i struggle to come up with any more examples than that . 
  i went to berlin with my german class . 
  we had a small exchange where we stayed for a week with the students in their english class , and then they came over and stayed with us for a week . 
  the only thing i remember going to while there was a concentration camp outside of berlin . 
  i do n't remember the name of it , but a quick google search says it ought to be sachsenhausen . 
  i also went to brussels in belgium with my ... well , a class that taught political stuff . 
  so we went there to learn about the eu , since the eu parliament is there . 
  when we actually went to the parliament an employee there stole my wallet , which led to me spending the day answering police questions and filling in paper works instead of actually going around learning the stuff that the entire trip was about . 
  got everything back okay later in the day , though . 
  turned out stealing something at the eu parliament security check-in was a very bad idea . 
  who knew ? 
  i ca n't imagine many places in the world having more cameras pointing at you than there . 
  i ca n't imagine a young person in sweden who do n't know english . 
  maybe not brilliant , wonderful and perfect english , but fairly good english nonetheless . 
  the education starts * so * early and english is * so * prevalent in society that it is basically impossible to not pick up . 
  same here . 
  i thought it was a thing of the past , but every once in a while it comes back again . 
  the funniest example was when my dad asked a band he 'd just discovered during a show they 'd played while he was on vacation somewhere abroad , if they had any plans on coming to sweden . 
  `` yeah , we 're doing a gig there next week ! '', 
  when he came home to sweden he immediately started looking for tickets but could n't find any . 
  it took quite a while until he realized that they were actually playing in bern the following week . 
  what an absolutely glorious map . 
  that is glorious . 
  had totally forgotten about him . 
  my dad used to buy them all the time when i was a kid . 
  ca n't speak for finland , but i used to see a lot of marvel comics when i was a kid in the 90 's . 
  not as much dc stuff - batman , but that was it - but i remember having a subscription for spider-man , x-men and a comic book that collected the best stories regardless of characters ( meaning it could be hulk one month and wolverine the next , and then thor the month after that ) . 
  i also read a lot of image comics , like spawn and witchblade . 
  it disappeared as i got older , though , and nowadays i rarely see any comics in general stores anymore . 
  a shame , because i really liked reading them as a kid . 
  but maybe kids read them digitally today ? 
  i know i would . 
  she 's wonderful and i love her , but i actually think that [ bamse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bamse ) would be a better answer here . 
  they represent two very different role models , even if they might appear pretty similar since they are both very strong . 
  but bamse is basically what happens if you mix pippi l\u00e5ngstrump with winnie the pooh , which is about as wholesome as you 'd expect from that description . 
  hahaha , wtf ? 
  hilarious , but probably for the totally opposite reason than what was intended ... 
  is d\u00f6ner iconic for germany ? 
  it looks just like kebab everywhere to me . 
  on the other hand , i think that kebab pizza is pretty iconic for sweden , so maybe i should n't be too harsh regarding what you pick . 
  i would n't be too surprised to find places like that in rural sweden either . 
  i just do n't have any personal experience living there . 
  that food stereotype is rather strange . 
  yeah , marmite 's shit and you seemed to have a weird affinity for salt and vinegar crisps when i was there as a kid , but other than that i had nothing to complain about . 
  perhaps nothing too remarkable , but certainly nothing that would help me understand the origins of the stereotype . 
  seems like a pretty chill place . 
  although i just binge watched five seasons of hawaii 5-0 , so you do seem to have an ungodly concentration of human trafficking drug lords with surprisingly personal vendettas against most members of the somehow above-the-law law enforcement . 
   that show is fucking gorgeous , though . 
  it 's probably better marketing for hawaii than most actual marketing for hawaii . 
  i do like that hawaii seems to be just as much of a melting pot as the rest of the us , but with different cultural ingredients from those found on the mainland . 
  it seems like a really interesting blend of cultures . 
  i have n't been to any especially remote places in sweden , but since i 'm half-finnish and my family used to own a house in finland in a rather remote area i hope that counts . 
  it was the type of house that kind of missed that the 20th century with all of its glorious innovations happened , so the heating came from a fireplace and if you needed to take a shit you had to go to an outhouse across the yard and swat off mosquitos as you sat there . 
  we had a neighbor on a hill across the road , but besides them there was a couple of miles until you ran into other people ( let alone a city ) . 
  i 'm half-german , half-finnish , so i 've got relatives in those countries .

  would that also be illegal to posses that video ( that i might or might not suspect already exists ) . 
  how is a buyer going to know the difference btw , or is all rape porn going to be banned ? 
  so why did n't he include the title . 
  can we all just skip the headline and use the first paragraph now ? 
  so , then you should be able to link to it . 
  prove it !, 
  where do i say greece is the devil . 
  you should try facts . 
  you are lying now and making stuff up . 
  where have i even mentioned the content , greece or that greeks are the devil . 
  you are a liar . 
  i think the rules says do n't manipulate the title . 
  you did , and there is no reason to exclude the title , other than you want to . 
  i think if everyone did like you , using the first sentence and not the headline , it it would be unreadable . 
  well , i think if one want to change the title one should always include the original title . 
  that should never , ever be excluded . 
  well , so not using the title , which you excluded , is not incorrect ? 
  all of us can just start to use the first sentence ? 
  when i went in to read it , i did not see the title , not at all . 
  i am on my phone and i saw something completely different . 
  if you are going to use an incorrect title , at least include the original title . 
  that can/should never be excluded . 
  why do you manipulate the title ? 
  i do not like when the opinion of the op , rather than what the article is about is in the headline . 
  also , i thought it was against the rules in r/europe . 
  we used to have very cheap electricity but denmark/eu raised the prices for around 7 million of us , despite the fact that they use coal . 
  that is rather annoying . 
  but honestly , i have never really understood how the prices here are calculated . 
  it depends a lot on the water levels up north and how cold it is . 
  we are not really potheads . 
  and liberal - perhaps but it is more like the rest of the world is conservative . 
  and we have problems too - youth unemployment , immigration , crime etc. 
  it is so weird just the picture one gets of sweden on reddit . 
  i am a female , could n't do it if i wanted to . 
  i suppose i could rub my breast against stuff , but i hardly think that would make the same impact ... 
  that is true . 
  i guess i have seen the camorra as one organism , not several fighting each other . 
  have to read up on the camorra again . 
  they are really a horrible lot . 
   do you have a swedish word for the act of swaffelen ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swaffelen i do n't know actually . 
  the reason i do n't say no is that somewhere in the back of my head there 's a bell ringing , but i could be wrong . 
  it sounds like a word we need ... we do have the word `` olla '' though . 
  that means touching your penis to stuff , sort of like a dog marking his territory ( not peeing though ) . 
  to be used in a sentence like `` so , your girfriend broke up with you ? 
  yes , but luckily i `` ollade '' her and her roomates toothbrushes before i left . 
  i think i will tell them in a week . 
  i have `` ollat '' all their plates too '' . 
  no , i do n't think they have any morals , not at all . 
  however , i figured that someone with some intelligence would figure out that it is bad to poison the area where * my * house is , if i am the one dumping the toxic waste . 
  i mean , i 'd dump the toxic waste in africa or somewhere if i was an immoral camorra boss , not in naples . 
  basically , do n't shit where you eat . 
  god , that is stupid . 
  i always assumed they were rather intelligent . 
  i do n't know if anyone has ever had this idea . 
  it is nothing i recognise , seems more of foreigner 's vision of what sweden should be like . 
  yes , if you do n't get your act together you 'll get a kebabslag you 'll never forget . 
  that word conjures up images in people heads of forever being incapable of having children . 
  sweden for example had forced sterilisations and those poor individuals were forever unable to have children . 
  wow , sorry , had no idea . 
  have to point out though that birth control is n't really sterlization , and immigration camps are n't really `` detention camps '' . 
  if a small country gets thousands of refugees , they have to give them shelter somehow , and a camp is often a reasonable solution . 
  i have never heard about that . 
  there 's plenty of dirt on israel without making stuff up . 
  no , they discussed it , but it was never set in motion . 
  yes , of course . 
  i had a friend who had to do it due to medical reasons when he was 16 . 
  oh , that is a really good one . 
  i completely forgot about harry potter . 
  i agree , they far right are doing the correct things all the time . 
  i am actually very impressed by their actions ( i am not voting for them , not at all , but that does n't mean i ca n't recognise smart politicians when i see them ) . 
   if the other parties keep downplaying these as radical fringe groups , they will be dumbfounded by electoral victories of the hard right again , i agree . 
  another thing is how idiotic adresses the far right . 
  instead of actually talking about the issues that the far right talk about they just accuse them of stuff . 
  why not adress the issues instead ? 
  what are you so afraid of if you are in the right and they are wrong ? 
  i also hate how they call them `` fear mongerers '' . 
  what , * every * party does that , it is part of being politician . 
  i 've heard cameron do that , but he is by no mean the only culprit , just the one who came to mind . 
  our swedish politicians do that , all the time . 
  yes , i agree , the us is an example of non religious circumcision . 
  but i do n't think it is the non religious people in europe that will circumcise and/or demonstrate against the law . 
  also , whether religious or not - it is obviously just as wrong . 
  why ? 
  it does n't matter if you do n't have a car . 
  no , i was trying to be nice . 
  obviously useless on you . 
  please tell me again how you are going to change the treaty quickly . 
  i know , it is weird how the eu/euro seems to bring out the worst in some . 
  i might not like the decision but that is my problem ( and i need to get over it ) . 
  how can anyone be against democracy , it bothers me . 
  even if you do n't like me and my arguments ( and while i do not agree with you i can most certainly understand your frustration ) you have to understand how things work . 
  i am not even saying that your arguments are wrong ( although i advocate a different solution ) but you can not suggest anything that is undemocratic and impossible . 
  so , instead of just saying that `` something has to happen '' you will have to understand that every eurosceptic in the world , from the moderate ones like me to the geert wilders and lepens in the world will fight you in court and the elections . 
  and we will win , since the law is on our side . 
  so , you have to come up with a solution that works within the law . 
  frankly , i am sure you agree with me that everything has to be done within the law . 
  and , if you take that into account , your solutions are not really feasible . 
  i do n't agree what was done to the irish , but it does n't mean that it will happen in germany . 
  i agree , a bit of democracy is not wrong .

  deep down , humans are masters at rationalizing and justifying their habits , so doctors tend to behave like people in general , at least when it comes to public habits . 
  right answer : [ snus ] ( http://blog.northerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/byron-white-snus-portions.jpg ) snus is still much more popular with men . 
  when people criticize putin , they usually criticize his third term . 
  it 's been dominated by consolidating power at home while `` restoring glory '' abroad , and not giving two fucks about being a predictable trade partner that focused on building the economy . 
  yes , the 2000-2012 era was good for russia . 
  it was also a time of high oil prices . 
  since 2012 , putin 's rule seems more interested in geopolitics than making russia a great place to live in . 
  why quarrel over living standards , when you can have pride and glory ? 
  when we 're lucky , we get mainland weather from central and eastern europe instead of north atlantic weather . 
  some summers are amazing , some suck . 
  it 's a lottery every year . 
  you are entirely missing the point . 
  there 's overlap of issues in international trade , where russia wants to sign bipartisan treaties on a tit-for-tat basis , and us/eu style treaties where markets are regulated in the open and multinationals can cross borders with increased ease . 
  so anti-globalism can be married with being pro-russia , since russia 's main exports , oil and gas , do n't matter much to anti-globalists . 
  otherwise the political discourse in europe is still the most diverse in the world . 
  russian agents also promotes conspiracy thinking : `` nothing is true , everything is a conspiracy '', 
  l o l, 
   poor things . 
  now what else are they going to do with all their money ? 
  invest it where the risks are lower ? 
  if you invest in something , let 's say a workshop for your own business , would you want to give it away for free when the local authority expropriates the land ? 
  or would you actually want to use the workshop to make things you can sell to other people ? 
  ironically , russia mostly supports existing movements too . 
  anti-establishment movements are easy to manipulate in that they lick up everything that runs counter to what the local government is saying . 
  the perfect audience . 
  he supports people who are for the freedom of press , international trade and freedom of self-expression ( also known as `` the gay '' ) . 
  nasty globalist in a nutshell . 
  also universal values over nationalism . 
  why do you think the un envoy to syria is willing to put his own life at risk to let the militants out of aleppo ? 
  an area where 200,000 are living is being bombed to dust . 
  philip morris lost in the end . 
  however , i agree that these arbitrary courts come with a number of problems . 
  the current mood in many eu countries is to say no to everything , though . 
  nuclear shutdown in germany was an unexpected decision based on the public reaction to an event in japan . 
  the trajectory before that pointed to a low risk of policy change in the medium term . 
  sure , you can pin all the risk on the investors , but that 's just going to give investors cold feet . 
  and * some * amount of protection for foreign investors seems reasonable , since arbitrarily shutting down a foreign business is a lot easier than doing the same for a national business . 
  the national business can rally local influence much easier . 
  what exactly `` the right amount of protection '' is , is another question . 
  my understanding of trade arbitration comes from the nuclear industry in germany . 
  the swedish company vattenfall invested a lot of money into german nuclear power . 
  before fukushima , permits to run power plans were processed so that the plants could run until 2035 - 2040 . 
  in a pen stroke , germany voided those permits and set an end-date to 2020 . 
  there 's a case now , where vattenfall is suing the german state for , yes , billions in lost profits . 
  this is the situation the anti-ceta folk want to eliminate : they want to governments to make [ canadian ] investments void of value without risking a lawsuit . 
  yeah , that 's one opinion . 
  another opinion you see quite often is `` the eu is a dictatorship '' . 
  britons posting standard eu-rants are going to get downvoted . 
  do n't see it that much otherwise . 
  i 'm not happy . 
  a popular opinion i 've seen is that the uk is screwing themselves by leaving . 
  everyone 's so convinced this is a bad deal . 
  my money is still on that the primary reason is not `` this particular trade deal will be bad for europe '' , but `` omg , there 's a clause that says local government are not allowed to screw over foreign companies without due process !, 
  '' , i. e. anti-free trade propaganda . 
  if the eu has nothing worth exporting , we 're doomed anyway . 
  but in the end , no deals are signed , because myopic thinking and bickering . 
  yay !, 
  elitist ? 
  no , the scaremongering about trade agreements have come to a point where common people , including people in this subreddit , think that international trade is bad . 
  it 's a fucking joke , that 's what it is . 
  yeah , there 's a significant roma minority in finland . 
  even in sweden , you can identify people as finnish roma . 
  they 're not beggars , and rarely scammers , these days . 
  those come from abroad . 
  yeah , i was in poland recently and met one of my wife 's friends . 
  he backed pis . 
  a major reason is that people got po-exhaustion . 
  corbyn leads a party that is undergoing the transformation from a major ruling party back to a movement . 
  that would be a first , no ? 
  russian images proudly show unguided carpet bombings . 
   has received a record low amount of refugees during the summer , despite expecting many more . 
  which weirdly coincedes with the russian intervention and the reversal of war fortunes for the syrian government and goes directly against the braindead ` russia intervened to create more refugees and destroy europe ' narrative . 
  the eu also made a deal with turkey , and macedonia closed ( etc ) closed the land route to europe . 
  now people are trying to go from egypt and libya instead , but in smaller numbers . 
  there are still millions out there who would rather be in europe than na or me . 
  the nature and timing of lies vary . 
  the us will deny cia activity , but not military action . 
  you 're probably right in general , but in sweden the road tax for diesel cars is higher , as well as being based on ( theoretical ) co2 emissions . 
   no , the eu has more relaxed nox/particulate emissions norms ( and some other requirements ) specifically for diesel engines because ... nobody really knows `` protectionism '' is a simplification . 
  european car makers made cars that were popular among europeans that happened to do well on many parameters , but not nox emisions , and no institution were all that interested in fighting them on this issue . 
  vw is also the biggest car manufacturer in the world ( in competition with toyota ) . 
  they 're the biggest player pushing for turbo-diesels . 
  it 's known that they cheated in america ( other makers used urea-additive in the us ) . 
  so i do n't think it 's that strange that they were persecuted for their cheating in the us . 
  yeah , this perplexes me too . 
  probably the truth is too damning , so they stalled to bury it . 
  i suspect there was an ceo-official gambit to `` play unfair first , ask for forgiveness later '' . 
  swedish arms makers ( and telcos such as telia ) have been pretty bad too . 
  key thing is that they have been prepared to bribe people in countries where bribes are expected . 
  instead of pushing for better business practices , they 've played to win . 
  ikea tried doing it the right way in russia ( as far as is know to the public ) , but they faced a lot of pushback when they did not bribe key players for permissions , to get projects started , necessary infrastructure , etc , etc. 
  the american norms were not set with turbodiesels in mind . 
  european tests were much more lax ( = bad ) , but also were set with diesel engines in mind . 
  the thing is that all ( or nearly all ) car makers cheat on the european nox test . 
  the fundamental problem is that many of the advantages of the diesel powertrain disappear when max nox levels are set to the same as for gasoline cars . 
  europe has had a 30 year long love-affair with turbodiesels and low fuel consumption , and emissions testing has been all too lax . 
  so i guess one reason that vw reacted as they did was because they know other makers were no better outside the us market . 
  the malign intent is the same . 
  yeah , the poles in gb are the worst !, 
  as seen in the brexit referendum , the people of europe oppose successful economic immigration too .

  why do n't you complain some more about how misunderstood you are ? 
  how the world claims that `` the french '' won the world cup when it was really just 11 guys on a field , and you had nothing to do with it . 
  and you write `` the americans , the brits etc '' but i guess that since you are french you have done nothing wrong ? 
  but i suggest that you start with some light reading . 
  first , learn the difference between the eurozone and the european union . 
  it was very evident from your comment that you had no clue . 
  second , after spending a few months learning that , perhaps you could move on to learning the countries in the eu ( i think europe will be to hard for you ) . 
  spend a week or two understanding the difference between finland and sweden . 
  then we can start to talk , and i 'll even download a bieber song for you . 
  no , i am not , but you are a whiner who takes everything personal . 
  how french of you . 
  you are so stupid that you do not even know the difference between the euro and the eu . 
  we voted no to the euro , but i guess you are so uneducated that you have n't figured out we are not in it yet . 
  hint , we are not finland . 
  buhu , my country fucked up and i am not taking respinsibility for it . 
  we forced the euro upon the europeans , poor , poor us . 
  keep whining , you are doing an excellent job . 
   and then have the balls to ask me to personally take responsibility . 
  you clearly have a problem against the french . 
  no , i did n't , i said , the french !, 
  which you read as `` me personally '' . 
  if i say `` the french should invade syria '' , i do not necessarily mean you , which i clearly explained to you . 
  however , you refuse to understand that , because you like to whine i guess and feel like a victim . 
  keep it up , you are an * excellent * whiner , you could whine for france . 
  here are posts when you are clearly incorrect , according to yourself . 
  how * dare * you write about `` the americans '' the way you do . 
   even if it does n't technically change anything for americans ' daily lives , it will be a major blow to america 's confidence , as most americans alive today have always lived in a world where they were on top . 
  and americans are a very proud bunch . 
  how america will react to being number 2 , to the `` commie '' chinese of all countries , remains to be seen . 
  but it could at least fuel social unrest . 
  how can you be 100 % sure that the americans are a pround bunch for example ? 
  are you sure there is not a single american who is not proud ? 
  what is this generalising that you do , it seems like you assigne traits to 300 million americans . 
  that is absolutely stupid , you can not know that . 
   what did give him some form of legitimacy for the french is simply that he did manage to impose himself as the prominent military leader of the free french forces how dar you speak for every single frenchmen here ? 
  perhaps someone did n't agree with degaulle , or are you saying that it never happened ? 
  please stop using `` the french '' you obviously have no clue about anything , since 100 % of the frenchmen had not agreed , or even voted about de gaulle at the time . 
   [ -- ] martelfirst 4 po\u00e4ng 3 dagar sen ( 4 | 0 )  it 's true , during ww2 the americans favored a more far-right-leaning french leader to command the free french forces ( slightly more `` far-right '' , because ultimately how dare you presume to know what every single american wanted ? 
  stop this immediately , you can not speak for the americans . 
   the british probably would n't do the same as they were for republican victory . 
  how dare you speak for the brits ? 
  how dare you . 
  you have no right to do that , you have no idea what 100 % of the brits think . 
  do you realise how fucking sillyt you are now , or do you want me to continue ? 
  yes and you complain and whine like the little baby you are when something does n't suit you . 
  buhu , someone said the french were responsible for the creation of the euro , but i am french , and i did n't create the euro . 
  i mean , it is correct that the french people democratically voted for and elected the people who forced the germabs to accept the euro and it is also equally true that they created a really bad euro and it is also true that we are just whining like me but since personally did n't do that no one on the planet can say `` the frebch '' . 
  then i will outwhine you until you can stand it no more . 
  you whiner . 
  accept that one say stuff like '' the french are responsible for x and the germans for '' . 
  i will read your posts very carefully from now on and if you ever say , `` the french '' without meaning 100 % of the population i will tell on you , just like you do . 
  so , unless you can mean 100 % of the population , do not ever mention nationalities again , you whiner . 
  remember that , no more mentioning of nationalities . 
  at some point when you leave your teen years we can have a grown up discussion about adulthood , euro , nationality and above all , responsibility . 
  until then , enjoy justin bieber and miley cyrus . 
  the french people choose to elect your leaders who forced a disastrous currency union upon the rest if europe . 
  and saying you do not accept blame - you have voted have n't you ? 
  you are part of a people that forced the germans to accept a currency . 
  or your parents did . 
  and , you and your peers have elected the inept leadership we see now from france , which is none . 
  you have elected people that are not being honest about forcing the euro upon the germans - i mean you are n't even admitting to it now . 
  it is a sore spot for you , but get over it and own up to it . 
  behave like adults . 
  and , then i also guess that you will never ever say something like '' we beat england '' because you personally did n't win then . 
  it is the same thing . 
  and you can never say something like '' israel harms palestinians '' because every israelian in the world is not doing that . 
  your arguments are beyond silly . 
  i hope i never see you write about nationalities here again because i will call you out , every single time , even if it is just `` we won '' . 
  because you did n't . 
  not you personally . 
  there is a huge consensus on what an optimal currency union is . 
  and , there is not a `` perfect '' one anywhere . 
  not on the euro . 
  since economists work in the world of politics , you can find marxists economists etc. 
  also , economists are aware that they live in an imperfect world with all its restrictions . 
  thus it makes more sense to advocate for debt reduction for greece , than a politically integrated union where the finns transfers huge amount of their wealth south and germany pay off italy 's debt . 
  however , head over to r/economists and ask if they consider the euro optimal even in an imperfect world . 
  internal devaluation is bad , in particular since there is no end in sight , no real debt reduction and it will take decades to raise their productivity to those levels of northern europe . 
  they are loosing several generations i mean , compare it to the currency union between ddr/brd . 
  the ddr had no debt , they have had enormous help from the west that made sure they have schools , pensions , social security etc and the ddr is still less competitive , more than 20 years after the fact . 
  how long will it take southern europe who has no help and corruption as a bonus ? 
  i fault the eurozone countries leaders for not acting . 
  they should . 
  help them or kick them out , but act . 
  no , that is really not the truth , not when it comes to spain and portugal , only greece . 
  are you not aware of how a currency union works ? 
  what is happening there is internal devaluation which is really tough . 
  are you denying that ? 
  i will post links as to how currency union works later on and then i 'd like for you to explain why you are right and the economists wrong . 
  sigh , if i say `` france is invading kongo '' or `` france is supporting israel '' i do not mean you personally . 
  do you honestly have no clue about the difference between a country and a person ? 
  do you want me to explain the difference between a state and a human to you ? 
  now you are just being very , very silly . 
  have you never heard expressions like `` the germans started wwii '' or `` the brits drink a lot of tea '' . 
  no , that does not mean that every single british person drink tea , but a lot of them do . 
  are you so dense that you do not get that ? 
  do n't you say france won , when you win in rugby against the brits , or what do you say ? 
  a team of players that ... that said - why did the french elect people that forced the germans into a currency union they never wanted ? 
  why did the french create such a bad currency union and why have you guys not tried to change things ? 
  why have n't you taken responsibility for it , just like generations of germans that never had anything to do with the war shoulder responsibility for that ?

wow , thanks for the text and translation . 
  in `` new turkey '' just one of these lines would guarantee you a lifetime in prison . 
  and i can see why he is pissed . 
  the song is rather catchy . 
  he probably found himself dancing to it involuntarily . 
  he is done with the free press in turkey . 
  now he is trying to control german media . 
  this is not his first attempt . 
  he threatened international newspapers and tv channels ( new york times , the guardian , cnn are some examples ) before . 
  however , previously he did it only by verbally threatening them . 
  now it looks like he upped his game by trying to apply the methods he used internally ( government pressure ) in an international way . 
  this only shows how delusional he became . 
  he assumes that merkel can control german tv as he controls the turkish one and thinks if he can manipulate merkel , he can manipulate tv via her . 
  it will be interesting to see how this story develops as it will show if the free press is really free . 
  ~ ~ turkey is in eet ( at least for now , they are considering to move east , and that might happen this week ) ~ ~ update : yes it actually happened . 
  turkey is in utc +3 from now on . 
  well , privatization can be interpreted as a good or bad thing depending on your personal views . 
  but i guess everyone can agree that selling a highly profitable government business ( or any business ) for less than it 's yearly revenue is not a very smart economic decision . 
  it might be done in a developed , stable economy to encourage private investment in a specific area but even than it should be done very carefully to cover for the economic impact . 
  his method is just `` sell 'em all '' . 
  can not agree with this one . 
  it is not like he has been a nice guy for years , and then suddenly went nuts overnight . 
  for the the sake of keeping this comment short , i will skip over his radical islamist , anti-democratic speeches he made before 2003 ( when he became the pm ) . 
  since his party had majority seats in 2002 , he started building his way to slowly creeping his own people in government institutions and building influence over media . 
  one of his first actions was to take over the media empire of cem uzan who is at least as corrupt as him , so that he could have been a threat . 
  later , he slowly continued his progress on these takeovers either by visible or invisible means ( like building influence over media moguls who has other investments through government projects etc. . . ) in the mean time , he built an imaginary `` our economy is doing great '' bubble . 
  since 21st century economy involves a lot of `` convincing people that you are doing well '' he managed to make the impression that the economy is actually going well . 
  in reality however , he funded this mirage by selling all profitable government businesses and land . 
  he also supported investments on short term , high visibility projects ( like a lot of construction work and opening thousands of shopping malls ) which actually do n't provide any sustainable economic stability so the economy always need to be fed from outside sources ( like the sales mentioned above or illegally taking over some large funds ) . 
  so as a result , currently turkish economy completely lacks a middle class with a high gap between the rich and the poor . 
  i always say it is a ticking time bomb and when it goes off , the results will be worse than greece . 
  in foreign relations they also failed miserably . 
  before 2002 , turkey had it 's problems but it was a well respected country in the diplomatic scene with a consistent attitude towards regional and global events . 
  while you might not agree with those policies , at least they displayed a consistency . 
  after his government , turkey did a lot of flips on nearly any regional event . 
  you can see it in the relations of turkey with eu , israel and arabic countries . 
  today , turkey is a country which is basically a diplomatic joke . 
  neither ex-allies , nor it 's neighbors trust turkey while planning any of their actions . 
  turkey has been pushed away from the global diplomatic scene . 
  finally , while all of this was happening , using his power over the media , he managed to turn all of these into things that gained him more popularity among the turkish people . 
  during this process , he managed to pass many laws which granted him mire and more power over the country . 
  finally , in 2010 , by changing the constitution ( where he got the votes of many left leaning people by promising to send perpetrators of 1980 military coupe to court ) one more time , he granted himself a lot more power over the judiciary branch of government and also over the military ( which has been the two last institutions resisting against his will ) . 
  using that power , he managed to place his supporters to critical locations in these organizations , granting him complete power over the country . 
  that 's when he started acting more openly as a dictator , in a way visible from outside of turkey . 
  his latest presidency , and the advantage he got over eu through the refugee crisis just empowered his ego so much that he now thinks that he can bend other countries to his will too . 
  wow , i wanted this to be a short one :-), 
  just to make things clear : in sweden , when people graduate from high school they already graduate with a good degree of english and most of the time do n't feel any need to learn a third language . 
  that 's why duolingo is used mostly by immigrants who use it as an extra tool while learning swedish at their state funded language courses . 
  as a result , it is perfectly normal that the number of swedish learners are higher than other languages . 
  as someone who just got finished with those courses , let me say that especially the first year is painstakingly slow , however it gets better over time . 
  i got both native swedish and immigrant instructors during my time and i can easily say that the immigrant one performed better than most of the native swedish ones ( to me , he shares the first place with another , native swedish one ) . 
  i can say that getting the right instructor is a matter of chance of course , however i believe the system in itself is consistent and well designed to achieve the goals that it was set to achieve . 
  turkish , living in sweden here . 
  simply put : this is the european attitude i enjoy seeing . 
  not just because it is against the false claims and wrongdoings of the turkish government but also because it is a great display of solidarity . 
  it is important that people of europe can gather around certain shared values , since it is the only way for a union with such a diverse structure and history to survive . 
  i do n't remember any time in the history of republic of turkey that a foreign affairs minister is denied entry or a minister is declared persona non grata by any other country . 
  the actions of netherlands is not something you can do `` in the heat of the moment '' or something they did just because they can . 
  they are hard decisions with consequences . 
  maybe it is time for the people in ankara to think about how it came to this point instead of spreading incoherent blame . 
  came here to write this and you beat me with 4 minutes . 
  so , greenland is not europe , but denmark and faroe islands are ? 
  i 'm not sure how they would respond if they heard that . 
  one would have a lot more chance if the exam was oral instead of written . 
  it just becomes a matter of hiding the potato properly in your mouth . 
  makes me laugh every time i watch it . 
  and i know it is pretty famous in sweden in general . 
  it 's in kungsportsplatsen, 
  i find the numbers on nordics rather hard to believe . 
  but of course results of this kind of research can depend highly on how the question is asked . 
  is there a link to the actual research ? 
  for someone who has been living in sweden for many years , i have n't met a single swedish citizen who identified as religious ( christian , muslim , jew etc. . . ) . 
  of course i have n't visited the bible belt of sweden , but from what i heard , even there it is around 30 % religious . 
  while most people was not religious , most did n't identify as atheist either . 
  this was not because they believed in any other deity or `` power '' though . 
  however , also most of them did n't specifically identify as `` atheist '' either . 
  i think it was mostly to avoid using that kind of controversial title . 
  you are right , i have n't checked its age . 
  nevertheless , it is still stands out among others for not being made of shiny glass . 
  i think when ranking buildings like this , there should be a weight defined by the age of the building . 
  as you can see , most of them are modern steel/glass buildings while esztergom basilica , st. peter 's basilica or palace of culture and science are much more impressive when you consider their age or the technology used to build them . 
  `` macedonia '' ? 
  are you trying to start a war or something ? 
  dear portugal , please stop using fahrenheit and switch to using celcius as your unit of temperature . 
  love , sweden ps : what ? 
  what do you mean you are using celcius ? 
  it is ridiculous to claim that anywhere on earth can be 46 c \u00b0 . 
  it is generally labeled as the `` dull city '' of turkey . 
  while there are many places in turkey which is a lot more dull than ankara , it became the poster child of dullness since it is the second biggest city and capital . 
  while the kernel of the city has its roots in the very old times , current day ankara maintained no connection to that history . 
  modern ankara is basically built after the republic , to become the capital and a star of the new , modern turkey however , as a result of being the capital , it developed to a huge city of bureaucracy , which you can see the effects everywhere . 
  still , in that form , the city had a bit of interesting qualities to itself . 
  you could have visited a couple of nice parks , dive deep into the history of the republic , take a look at the historical roots of the city/anatolia by visiting museum of anatolian civilizations , and if you are brave enough get to the old fortress , where you can enjoy the old streets before getting stabbed/robbed . 
  however , even that limited attraction of the city disappeared after the current mayor came to power at 1994 ( yes , 23 years ago ) . 
  after him , the face of ankara lost all its attraction and just became a city of bureaucracy and huge shopping malls . 
  of course together with him , his ideology also started to gain power and a more conservative mindset started to dominate the city . 
  so as of today , it is not even a shadow of the city which it was planned to be . 
  clearly you have n't been to many cities in turkey . 
  try some underdeveloped central anatolian city where they actually kill gay people instead of putting up signs for it . 
  edit : i do not mean to defend what they do in ankara , just showing that it is not the lowest point

  it 's one of our biggest export in terms of natural resources iirc . 
  yo i heard you liked trees ? 
  now that 's what i call edgy !, 
  i 'm just echoing what the kurdish organisation said on their website/facebook page . 
  i do n't have any further information . 
  oil . 
  the kurdish organisation holding the rally has blamed turkish nationalists or something like that . 
  * looks sneeringly to the southwest *, 
  because it 's just not done in swedish press to release the name of someone until their judgement has been rendered . 
  though it is a public document that a private person can request and look over . 
  i think that they 're being a bit bossy but their heart is in the right place . 
  idk , the police officer in question has come out and said that he did n't mention the swedish democrats specifically but rather just said `` xenophobic forces '' . 
  they are n't changing their actions , they 're changed how they report on what they do . 
  not really , most people just do n't care too much . 
  it 's something you talk about at dinner parties between the main course and dessert . 
  idk . 
  he just seems like a huge coward who wants to earn his paycheck and leave at the end of they day without being called by any journalists . 
  or he does n't want sd to gain more voters . 
   a conspiracy of silence perpetuated to help the migrants commit mass sexual assault . 
  that 's hyperbole . 
  you could from the events in cologne and on this festival argue that people from the middle-east/north africa does n't fit in and does not respect european/german/swedish society and law , but what you can not claim from this is that there is a concious deliberate conspiracy to keep these things from mainstream media . 
  but that 's just my opinion . 
  but to go back to what you said i think it is true that recent political and social trends put preussare on people to keep a lid on these things . 
  that 's his point . 
  which is just plain cowardice , it 's not his call to make imo . 
  there might be true to what they 're saying , but the slant is usually to misrepresent the facts . 
  many swedes and me among them think that sd should not be in parliament nor government but i think that withholding information like that helps sd more than it helps wherever he has chosen to lay his political sympathies . 
  i would n't say that it 's a matter of puplic safety as anyone can be a predator , but i think that all the facts of incidents should be laid upon the table . 
  even if they might seem damning to certain leanings . 
  i 'm not sure it means he should resign , i think he desrves a chance to redeem himself . 
  though i wholeheartedly agree that there should be consequences for the police 's mishandling of this situation , keeping information like that from the press is simply not the his call to make . 
  no i do n't think so , the minister of justice is appointed by the government but the police chief gets promoted by merit as far as i know , and this just police chief for the s\u00f6dermalm police force which is a part of stockholm . 
  i ca n't say that i completely agree with all that you 're saying , but withholding information like that is not his call to make . 
  if he were a politician it would be less damning , because liar and politician are almost synonyms . 
  yes , you 're right . 
  that guy is a lone police officer and not the police departments press person . 
  that might explain why they did n't run the story . 
  translation ( to the best of my ability ) :  it 's a sensitive topic , sometimes we do n't dare to say things as they are because we 're afraid that it plays into the hands of the swedish democrats ( populist right-wing ) . 
  we have to take responsibility within the police-force . 
  what a coward . 
  edit : improved translation, 
  i 'm not too bothered over a 42 median age . 
  i 'd suspect with what we 'd be healthy enough to live much more active lives . 
  i just feel like whenever there 's been turmoil in france in the last few centuries paris is either sacked , starving , occupied , really filthy , or the center of a revolution . 
  ** paris ** , the city that always gets a raw deal when france is in trouble . 
  come back brother !, 
  we always loved you more than denmark !, 
  not to mention that the deal was bullshit anyway . 
  turkey could very easily stem the flow of refugees without foreign aid . 
  they just do n't . 
  yeah i 'd want to get out too because that seems like clusterfuck waiting to happen . 
  actually some of them have been complaining about the woods here in sweden . 
  though i expect that 's due to them having to live on a converted lodging spot in the middle of nowhere fun . 
  have you tried finnish food ? 
  it 's spooky not scary . 
  totally different things . 
  exactly , though i do n't understand why he went for the deepest aspect of being a finn first . 
  if he had any sense he would at least aclimate himself to the booze first . 
  nope . 
  consveratives in sweden are weak-sauce christians . 
  the neo-nazi/farther right organisations like to call up the viking stuff . 
  the symbol of mjolnir have been adopted by a few neo-nazi organisations . 
  though since you asked , the swedish version of cowboys would probably be a forester from northern sweden . 
  sorry , the christian values in sweden are no more . 
  we 're homosex nation now !, 
  it also seems to be run by affluent and oblivious expats . 
  the gun is a weapon for the weak and the instrument of oppression !, 
  the true socialist revolution must be fought for with sword and shield !, 
  50-99 % that 's a pretty safe estimate i take it ? 
  what 's the best answer to violence ? 
  more violence !, 
  i mean it is hard to find another solution when one side is actively engaging in atrocities and murder , at the same time as it would be impossible to negotiate with them without legitimizing them . 
  though i hope we 'll see another way that does n't involve violence soon . 
  maybe mind-control or something . 
  i do n't think that 's quite right . 
  extreme ideologies like nationalism or fundamentalism are on the rise because things are changing so people who oppose the change naturally have to find something they do n't want to change and cling to it . 
  to some it 's the nation and to others it 's the religion . 
  they did n't promote it . 
  they just did n't give a shit so long as it did n't undermine their authority . 
  religion as a whole is reactionary . 
  it 's just that in most of europe there is either no need for any religious organisations to stir shit up , or they 've shifted their marketing . 
  whoop whoop !, 
  now you 're tempting me to continue . 
  it 's more fun when you 're mad . 
  i 'm just trying to bend the words as much as possible , to see if they brake . 
  though i 'm against the prohibition of any type of clothing ( or the absence of it ) i 'm not getting too involved with this debate . 
  well burqas and niqabs are native customs to muslim countries . 
  so as long as they 're worn by muslim natives i do n't see a problem with this . 
  sure but calling yourself a `` humanitarian superpower '' is the height of arrogance . 
  and since we 'll have a cold winter this year i 'm sure it wo n't be pretty for those poor fuckers in military tents . 
  sure military tents are pretty cozy with the built in stove thing , but i doubt anyone wants to live inside them long term . 
  i know this is an issue of logistics but i feel a small amount of satisfaction that none of our politicians can look down from their position as a `` humanitarian superpower '' ( ugh , that phrase just makes me wan na puke ) anymore . 
  i said scolded not punished . 
  you can bet that most international news agencies would be really mad about causing an international incident . 
  after four years of being shit on i would expect him to be quite cooperative . 
  probably bad things . 
  we would also be scolded by the eu and un pretty harshly . 
  that 's not going to happen with erdrogan because everyone knows the man is insane and wo n't listen . 
  i wonder how people would react if i ran into our parliament screaming `` deus vult ! '', 
  probably the same as in this article since i would be disturbing it .

  i 've been stuck with my nose in a john ajvide lindqvist short story collection for the past week , but just finished it . 
  so , uh , i do n't know . 
  reading it did reignite my love for reading , though , so i might just pick up another book . 
  i 'm currently eying `` doctor sleep '' by stephen king . 
  i 've had it in my collection for years , but never read it . 
  i * do * love king , so we 'll see about that . 
  i have another collection of swedish fantasy short stories that i also have yet to finish , so i 'll probably pick up one or the other . 
  other than that i do n't have any direct plans . 
  might see if my dad want to go out to eat , like we 've talked about for a while but never gotten our butts up to do . 
  i do n't know if there are any serious resentments going on , except from people who sort of live and breathe to hate people ( neo-nazis and so on ) . 
  since we have n't been in a war for two centuries we 're pretty chill with most people . 
  ca n't really hold a grudge against russia for them taking finland in the early 19th century . 
  the nordic feuding is just sibling rivalry , and the banter between different regions of sweden is n't any more serious either . 
  this is my favorite type of swedish swearing . 
  you can get * really * creative . 
  back in the day , people had a habit of thinking that if you spoke * about * the devil ( or other monsters ) directly , they would appear . 
  ( i would guess that 's where the `` speaking of the devil '' saying comes from . ), 
  as such , they would create new terms for the same being , so that they could speak of it without invoking it . 
  then it sort of snowballs from there as more and more expressions are formed for the same thing . 
  you can see it in other places in swedish as well . 
  we have ( had ) a shit ton of words for `` wolf '' as well , since that is something people were scared of in the past . 
  in fact , our current word for wolf ( `` varg '' ) is not the original word we had for the animal , but one of those `` dance around the true name '' words . 
  the original word ( `` ulv '' ) is n't really used anymore , except for in `` varulv '' ( werewolf ) . 
  just some random knowledge/context for ya !, 
  27 degrees ? 
  how do you survive ? 
  i assume it 's because of the sun heating up your home and not because it 's `` set '' at that temperature ? 
  i 'm not sure if we have such a strict separation of pupils , but there is some after a while . 
  first there are nine years where everyone is together . 
  after that you can drop out if you want to and feel happy not having a job in the future . 
  for everyone else there are three more years , but here you can choose a path . 
  me , i went down the `` societal stuff '' path . 
  it can be a bit difficult to explain since it 's pretty broad , but i ended up studying sociology later in university which should give an indication of this path . 
  other paths focuses more on nature stuff ( biology , physics etc ) , computer stuff and technical stuff . 
  there are also paths for music or sports , if you are so inclined . 
  probably even more , if you want to specialize even more . 
  and from there on there 's university , plus some re-education centers ( which my sci fi damaged brain translates as `` fascist indoctrination centers '' when i see the term in english , but it 's nothing of the sort :p ) . 
  my grandfather ( a swede ) and my grandmother ( ethnically german , but living outside of germany since the borders had been redrawn post-ww1 ) had very different stories about the russian forces . 
  which is a bit odd , since it was my grandmother who told me my grandfather 's stories ( he died when i was a baby ) . 
  but he could end up playing cards with them , since he was an ambulance driver for the red cross and therefore not an enemy to them . 
  my grandmother 's own recollection of the red army was very different . 
  i 'm however not sure if her family had to flee to germany ( or sweden , in her case ) because of the red army , or if they just hid from them and were later chased away by their non-german neighbors . 
  either way , her stories did n't exactly paint russians in the best of lights . 
  it was a long time since i heard them since she passed away many years ago , but i remember vague fragments of a very scary time . 
  maybe i 'm missing some sarcasm here , but is n't not murdering children for something so ridiculously innocent kind of a low bar to set when calculating people 's generosity ? 
  maybe i 'm missing some sarcasm here , but is n't not murdering children for something so ridiculously innocent kind of a low bar to set when calculating people 's generosity ? 
  now i really need to 1 ) learn spanish , and 2 ) really tick off a spaniard oh so fiercely . 
  i want to see that irreverent anger in action !, 
  with all of the norwegians around us , we 've never really had to be for a good time . 
  their bumbling ways always provide plenty of laughs on their own . 
  you have some seriously funny people . 
  dara o'briain has been a favorite comedian of mine for years , while aisling bea is a more recent comedy crush i have . 
  how come vietnamese people are such a big minority group in czechia ? 
  we do ? 
  i kind of recognize the siesta one ( sorry !, 
  ) , but the other ones ? 
  in my experience , the stereotypes we have of you are more in how you are different from us : we are quiet , so you are ( comparatively ) loud ; we are reserved , you ( again , comparatively ) outgoing . 
  sidenote : do you even * have * donkeys ? 
  i 've always thought of them as more of an american ( in the continental sense of the word ) animal . 
  it really depends . 
  if i 'm feeling well , sure . 
  either i can enlist the help of someone i know or i can take a cab . 
  if i 'm in pain , however , i 'm not leaving the apartment ; i have trouble navigating * in * the apartment . 
  so after a low , i need some time for my feet to get well enough for me to be able to use them . 
  i 'm slowly getting there , but it takes some time . 
  i was n't aware of estonia wanting into nordics as much before i joined reddit/askeurope . 
   i mean that both jokingly and more seriously . 
  the serious aspect of it is that i 've learned a lot about estonia and , especially , their relationship with finland . 
  as a half-finnish swede , that 's been really interesting since i was n't aware of that relationship before . 
  putting aside the whole `` into nordics '' of it all , i also feel like i 've gotten to know estonia ( in particular , and the other baltic nations to a lesser extent ) better than i had before , which is pretty cool as well . 
  on a more general note , it 's been pretty informative to hear from people in eastern europe . 
  it adds perspective to things . 
  thanks !, 
  thanks !, 
  yeah , that bit about struggling with people not seeing one 's disability is something i 've noticed too . 
  for me , people only see me when i 'm feeling basically at the top of my game , which is when i can actually get out and go to the doctor or whoever . 
  my family might occasionally see me when i 'm worse , if i ask them to shop groceries or something when i ca n't , but government officials etc only ever see me at my very best . 
  it makes it kind of hard to explain that the vast majority of days are significantly worse . 
  one thing i 've found fascinating about the uk , though , is the show the last leg . 
  it feels a bit weird as a non-brit to explain to a brit what a british show is , but just in case you have n't seen it : it 's a talk show hosted by three people , two of whom have various disabilities . 
  it 's not exclusively about disabilities - they discuss a wide variety of topics - but it 's a thing that comes up every now and again . 
  i found it really interesting . 
  i watched the latest episode ( a few weeks ago ) on youtube and was immediately hooked . 
  not only is it really funny , but i identified a lot with their discussions about disabilities and the troubles they faced . 
  i 've never seen anything like it , in sweden or elsewhere . 
  i found the sheer existence of such a show really cool , and i think they 're four seasons in , so apparently it 's going rather well . 
  it felt pretty heart-warming , in a way . 
  during my last doctor 's appointment i was referred to a. . . i do n't really know what to call it , but a place where you go to have your need for `` help items '' examined/supplied . 
  problem is , my last doctor 's appointment proved to be a bit too much for my feet to handle ( which feels incredibly ironic , in a way ) , so i 've been pretty much knocked out since then . 
  i 'm slowly getting better , though , so hopefully i 'll get there and get something to help me get around better . 
  need to get there first . 
  right now that 's a pretty big hurdle , since i 've barely been out of the apartment for quite a while . 
  when i 've worked up some strength again i 'll try to get there and then we 'll see . 
  well . 
  i ca n't speak for people in general , but i find myself in a weird situation since i ca n't walk properly , but at the same time is n't paraplegic . 
  it would probably be a little easier if my feet/legs just straight up never worked , but how much i can walk any given day swings wildly between `` to the store nearby/other simple errands '' and `` walking ? 
  really ? 
  lol no '' . 
  the problem is that this does n't qualify me for disability benefits , since i technically am '' fit to work '' ( neither my butt or my fingers are busted , so i could potentially sit in an office and type in front of a computer screen ) . 
  i just ca n't * get * to work , but that 's a problem that no one i 've met really cares to much about .

if you see nordic `` fighting '' , esp between danes and swedes , know that its only two brothers fighting . 
  he is a danskj\u00e4vel , but he is our danskj\u00e4vel !, 
  yes . 
  the entire top of the company are in holland now . 
  tax reasons and what not . 
  [ and as in real life . 
  is there any explanation for the germanic nations doing so well ? 
  is it just a coincidence ? 
  - bj\u00f6rn s\u00f6der p\u00e5 svt opinion 2013 so rut is lying then ? 
  this is such a false claim . 
  firstly : the ruling partys does not put forward the motions they know will get voted down from the opposition . 
  since that would be bad press , i.e. 
  `` the goverment have lost 50 % of the votes so far '' doesnt win you elections . 
  second : since it is this way swedendemocrats have ~ 51 % voting with the goverment on the motions that gets put up for voting , and the socialdemocrats have around ~ 48 % voting in line with the goverment . 
  it 's a media agenda to portray the sweden democrats as the knee-hound of the goverment . 
  madness among the general population . 
  the right want to dump wages and the left want voters . 
  what was the book called ? 
  he is as little norwegian as i am chinese , if i where to move there . 
  it might be that the time of great power are seen with a glorious aura for most swedes . 
  and that might spill over to the subject of conquered areas and it 's people . 
  i can understand that the finns dont see it that i do . 
  but i think we had something great going in the way where we still to this day comes along great . 
  this is not the reality in many other countries where one ruled over the other at one point . 
  i feel very close to my nordic brothers and would not shy away from intergrating our countries even more . 
  i dont know if this really answer your question though . 
  i would n't mind it . 
  mind you , we 've been a country togheter with finland for a longer period of time then with sk\u00e5ne ( scania ) . 
  i would say that the swedish-finnish union might be a good thing . 
  however , i find it very hard to believe that it would become a reality though . 
  yes . 
  they talk that around 1 m. of sweden 9 m. population consume snus on a daily ( / weekly ? ), 
  basis . 
  that would make our consumption of tobacco a lot higher . 
  what a fun idea !, 
  do you want a postcard from sweden ? 
  its not about sex at all . 
  its about mutilating on a child that can not defend itself . 
  if everyone got to chose at 18 or 21 it would be no problem . 
  yeah sweden !, 
  get the hell away from us with your awesome welfare , wonderful women and otherwise superior country !, 
  you are making us look bad , go away !, 
  oh sure you can adopt the culture , it is needed for you to establish yourself in society . 
  and in the long run for your children and grandchildren to intergrate . 
  however , a 30 year old man ( or 20 or 50 or whatever ) that moves to a new country does not become ` swedish ' or ` chinese ' from just getting a new passport . 
  you have to agree with me on that ? 
  i know i am in the minority with this point of view , but no , you can not get ` swedish ' or ` bristish ' if you are not born in said country . 
  you can be a swedish or british * citizen * . 
  but being swedish and british does take in cultural and historical values aspects - atleast for me . 
  i know its not the best comparison but if i moved to china or thailand , i wouldnt become a chinese or thai right ? 
  i would still be a swedish person - who is living in china . 
  granted , that if your family lives in one country over a few generations - and your grandchildren knows nothing else then said country , then sure they might become swedish or british or chinese . 
  but that is a question if they have been open to the new country , taking in the new values and traditions . 
  edit ; born and raised in said country , or with parents/family that you learn the cultural/historical codex and moral values as traditions that are uniqe for that specific people and country . 
  good luck on your move here !, 
  study or work ? 
  and hell yeah to not having to throw your cloths away after a night out !, 
  indeed it is ( i am a ` snusare ' myself btw ) . 
  i know that ciggaretts = / = snus . 
  but there might be some correlation between the two of them . 
  and it is important for the wider picture . 
  why do sweden have so low cigarette usage ? 
  perhaps it 's becuase nearly 1 million swedes use snus ? 
  do n't think swedens numbers are that great . 
  sure it 's only 13 % that smoke , but we got 1 million snusare aswell . 
  thats quite alot of tobacco usage . 
  i do n't know how fair i can answer this question . 
  however i will give it a try . 
  ( from a swedes view , that do not live in stockholm ) . 
  first off : i love both stockholm and k\u00f6penhamn ( copenhagen ) . 
  i have visited stockholms plenty of times and k\u00f6penhamn and denmark in general a few times . 
  answer : i dont think you will find a too big difference of culture between the two . 
  i feel at home at both places ( and lost aswell from time to time in both ) . 
  i would dare to say that danes and swedes in general are quite alike . 
  therefor i guess that a trip to both would not make you shocked in any way . 
  stockholmare might be more ` with the nose in the air ' - however you will find those people everywhere , even in k\u00f6penhamn . 
   you will get around just as good in both places since both danes and swedes speak good english . 
  overall i think you can enjoy a visit to both . 
  there will be plentyfull of things to do , see and experiance at both places . 
  make one trip now and another later and see what town you like the most . 
  either way i think you will have a great time !, 
  if you enjoy winter activities sweden/norway are the way to go . 
  also a high procentage of the population speaks english ( and the young adults even more so due to high influx of english in popular culture . ), 
  although sweden are beautiful in the spring/summer aswell . 
  highly recommends stockholm during the warmer months . 
  fantastic breakfast , made for a king !, 
  spot the batman !, 
  well me and my family are talking about leaving sweden for another nordic country . 
  the situation here is getting out of hand , and i do n't want to be a part of a country that basicly renamed itself `` relocation place 1a '' . 
  there is no sweden anymore . 
  the left and right have both sold out this country . 
  finland , im coming bro . 
  all of them ? 
  i feel its kinda late even . 
  a halfyear ahead of time feels about right for me . 
  and poland had what ? 
  and i would guess most are from germany/eastern europe . 
  dont get me wrong here . 
  but at times its fun to tease . 
  dont know what i was thinking .

  edit : wish i knew this, 
  hopefully school days does n't happen, 
  how is germany least compassionate ? 
  do they mean the country or its people ? 
  i assume there was some sort of agreement between greece and turkey and that the problem is turkey not leaving . 
  that seems like western europe values instead, 
  what 's wrong with eu gun grab ? 
  hopefully japan trade deal would make their goods cheaper, 
  perception is more important than intention . 
  if greece would 've left cyprus alone , none of this would happen, 
  you should check standard of living and lifespan of third world countries . 
  europeans are already a minority in today 's world . 
  why is that ? 
  so that the abuse is done outside jurisdiction ? 
  speaking from experience ? 
  i was about to get my pitchfork ready . 
  would love to hear opposite view here . 
  do n't want this to be a circlejerk, 
  doubling down , are we ? 
  ca n't picture that . 
  you have a problem with daily mail being banned ? 
  polls are anonymous though, 
  i see that as them diversifying their assets , not going into politics in europe . 
  same as china . 
  all i 'm saying is that it 's better to read from many sources, 
  russia has bigger ambition on international interests . 
  i doubt qatar cares about outside middle east, 
  politicians are afraid of defense contracts being reduced . 
  what reason would the authorities look the other way . 
  besides qatar interest , their reporting on issues are informative . 
  i say that everytime i look at what 's happening in europe and us, 
  i believe it has become a tradition, 
  you do n't see the irony when you yourself is trying to shutdown dissidents . 
  it 's xenophobic , not racist and do n't try to silence others . 
  your priorities are warped . 
  criticizing the only person who identifies xenophobic comments yet letting others do the opposite . 
  why do you hate yourself ? 
  they had a meltdown when cameron won the election . 
  td subreddit is not a place to have constructive discussions . 
  yes , that 's why i support secularism throughout the world . 
  participating in free open societies challenged those views . 
  french people of foreign origin did not make them less french than those who are not . 
  majority african francophone countries are christians . 
  only senegal is exception . 
  you 're so full of shit . 
  polls in france would show that they do n't want african migrants as well, 
  your fears are unwarranted . 
  russia has more influence in balkan region than turkey . 
  lol turkey ca n't even handle iran influence . 
  you 're overestimating turkey . 
  you mean russia, 
  hopefully islam does n't exist as it is today, 
  i would love to see a video of that, 
  how long will it be once islam passes as not alien ? 
  this is european forum . 
  why would a european be in td ? 
  i know it 's hard for you to understand that people are n't nationalists . 
  there 's no sense of loyalty to a country that does n't provide shit to their citizens . 
  france believes that being french is n't about blood or ethnic . 
  that 's what their secularism was built upon, 
  if trump was only effecting america , i 'd join with you, 
  christianity used to be an alien thing from middle east, 
  so france would be okay with francophone africans ? 
  trump himself said it was a muslim banned, 
  i also was antisemitic and against gays . 
  not enough to do something about it , but having an open society challenged those views . 
  it 's xenophobia plain and simple, 
  it was a trump joke, 
  by being an ass, 
  morocco does n't send their best in europe, 
  is it bad for me to want merkel leading on foreign and eu affairs in these troubled times ? 
  even though i align with schultz political views , no one comes close to merkel 's foreign influence . 
  did he say anything about canada 's incedent ? 
  total failure, 
  i know it 's hard to believe but kurdish terrorists do exist , just as there are arab terrorists . 
  i meant spying . 
  germany 's reluctant on sharing information on terrorists just because they 're kurds is n't a good excuse . 
  since when was turkey and kurdish forces in syria/iraq fighting against each other ? 
  head of state . 
  remember snowden leak ? 
  ireland and northern ireland have their own schengen, 
  the whole slogan was take back control . 
  whether they want to reduce migration is another matter . 
  majority voted for uk to have control of their sovereignty . 
  uk and ireland will still be able to allow freedom of movement between one another . 
  there just need to be security checks . 
  ca n't have eu border open to non eu countries, 
  yet germany is completely okay with america doing one is citizens and heat of states ? 
  self deprecating ? 
  i do believe western countries should hold responsible for exporting foreign terrorists to failed states . 
  uk wants to control their borders . 
  that 's why they left eu . 
  what is this madness ? 
  i 'd rather not live under mob rule , than you very much, 
  it would be shameful for any other country to have it 's citizens break the law outside their country . 
  i 'm sure they well be some mutual agreement, 
  i 'm sure eu can offer morocco a deal they ca n't refuse . 
  have them sign it, 
  it 's not hypocritical if you do n't believe in militarily spending, 
  northern europe just believes that they already have a good governing structure and does n't want to risk having outsiders the over them .

  a ) the eurozone implement the ftt , and the traders will stay within the eurozone ( paris/frankfurt ) , even if they can move and avoid the tax elsewhere , like london/stockholm . the eurozone politely ask other countries if they want to join , and they are ok if no one else wants to join . 
  b ) we ( the world ) implement the ftt all across the world simultaniuosly , and everyone benefits from the ftt . 
  everyone has seen the value of the ftt , and are doing it to help europe 's failing economies . 
  i believe in : c ) the eurozone implements it , the trade will move , they will lose money and more lose of prestige and remove the tax . 
  before that though , they will bully ( or as you say , be diplomatic about it ) other countries to implement it to . 
  maybe small countries like mine have to obey , maybe not . 
  they will not get london , china , us , canada , australia , russia , japan , brazil along , no way . 
  if i got it wrong with a and b , please enlighten me to what you think will happen when you implement the ftt then . 
  have a nice evening . 
  well , you do n't have to , and if you do n't feel like it , the french one is the shortest . 
  it is just that you asked about the science behind my opposition towards the ftt . 
  do you have any science articles for me , being pro ftt ? 
  do you have any science articles about implementing a global tax , like you want to with china , japan , us ? 
  i really have n't found any about implementing global taxes , particularely while including dictatures so i am a bit curious how you plan to go about it . 
  ok , i thought about fogh rasmussen saying that you were going to vote on it again in 2007 , but you never did that , now that i think about it . 
  thanks, 
  did n't you vote yes to the euro ( swede here ) ? 
  are you going to vote again on the euro , or just on the additional deal ? 
  yes , each got to choose their favourite slide !, 
  here are some of the links you asked for , arguments against the ftt . 
  in case you do not have access at the moment to databases , i have chosen articles where you can just copy and paste it to google scholar .

  to say the least , it was even hard to find positive articles about the tobin tax , even when i tried to find any . 
  basically almost all of the articles i found were against it . 
  i am looking forward to your articles and papers including examples of what sweden did wrong , how china/us is going to bow to diplomatic pressure , how the scientist are wrong about the ftt and more issues that i am sure i have forgotten to mention . 
  have a nice evening . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-16090055 ) is a slide that illustrates what your professor what talking about ( the real exchange rate and export , the last one in the slideshow ) . 
  while i agree with that , i really do see this as only a part of the problem . 
  beggar thy neighbour did n't force greek corruption and low productivity , or the fact that almost no eurozone country lives up to * their own * rules , french banks etc. 
  it is one issue , yes , but certainly not the single cause of the crises . 
  you did bring up an interesting point though , thank you for the video . 
  i know , that is one of the many reasons that i do not want those taxes . 
   sweden has pledged to join the euro eventually and has participated and profited from the eu for decades . 
  sure , you were n't at the core of the problem , but we 're supposed to be in this together , right ? 
  if not , sweden can leave . 
  some of sweden 's politicians have already indicated that the parliament may well not give their approval to this agreement . 
  that is not what you said before you are changing the argument . 
  i quote `` the fact of the matter is that everyone fucked up , when we decided to open up our economies so much without providing some more integration '' . 
  we did not fuck up , and i have asked you to provide example of where sweden did that . 
  also , we have been paying netto since we joined , * while * battling a financial crises of our own , reforming a our pension system etc. 
  we did not receive any money from the eu then , which is perhaps better in the long run because we were forced to change . 
  second , we are in the ** eu ** together , not the ** euro ** . 
  and yes , we might not ever join the euro , but saying that we have to leave the eu , because we are not joining in with the euro , is plain bullying . 
  why ? 
  you have to separate those two . 
  and , sidenote , there is no way sweden is going near the euro at the moment . 
  a poll published today said a whopping 10 % of the population wants to join . . we have more people believing in martians . 
  third , we have not yet joined the euro , so we have not integrated the way you imply or the way eurozone countries have . 
  why do we then have to pay for the * eurozone 's * mistakes , not ours . 
  and , why do we have to pay in a way * you * decide ? 
  ( taxes not decided by us ) if the eurozone countries decide not to obey the rules they themselves set up , decide to rush into a fiscal union without solving the political problems first , to ignore underlying structural problems , to ignore incompatible economies , to ignore rampant corruption in some parts , the fact that they increase spending without any real growth etc - we did n't do that to you . 
  you did that . 
  you did not create our crises in the 90 's , we did not create yours now . 
  i am ok with transfers has to be done , but i am not ok with a single krona going towards corruption or so other countries do n't have to deal with their issues . 
  also , i am not ok with paying more than we already are . 
  that is what the eu want !, 
  and the money is going to cover for the deficit they were n't supposed to have in the first place !, 
  we are providing plasters to a patient who has cancer ...  they who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety that is correct but i find it unrelated to the point . 
  good - then you are not forcing us in any way to implement ftt then ? 
  because doing that is would be clearly undemocratic , would n't it and forcing us to give up our freedom . 
  so , let us then pay what we currently pay and leave us alone then . 
  forcing issues upon us that has been caused by eurozone mismanagement is not very democratic , is it and i am glad you are agreeing with me on that . 
  what more , i do not believe china , japan , us * et al. 
  * is going to follow the eurozones lead , why should they . 
  you ca n't even get sweden , hungary etc to agree with you . 
  also , our finances is a lot better managed than the avarage eu/eurozone country and we do not want to hand over more power to you , or more money . 
  are you saying sarkozy is better at managing the finances than anders borg ? 
  i have never proposed to dismantle the eu , which you seem to imply but maybe the euro . 
  that is however , up to the euro-countries . 
  just ignore us , while you solve your problems.i do not see why i should pay for the saving of a currency i do not believe in . 
  it will affect us too , greatly , but it is better than throwing billions down the drain for decedes , which is what essentially has been done . 
  let the recession come then , perhaps that will force the necessary reforms . 
  last , long post , but of course i will provide you with links , i 'll just do that in next answer . 
  while i agree with you that economics is not the most reliable of sciences ( while i have read some economics , i am more of a science scientist myself ) i do tend to believe a lse professor more than some `` unknown '' ( in the nicest way possible ) arguing on the internet . 
  i 'd like you to provide me with scientific links too , as a base for your belief that china/us will join in and that the ftt will help . 
  have a nice evening, 
   it 's hard to have papers available that tell you stuff about large scale economics , simply because it 's hard to create meaningful experiments that deal with these complexities . 
  well , that 's why we have scientist , since everyone ca n't be an expert on everything . 
  i 's say that most economics scientist are against , it , but the eurozone is arguing for . 
  would you do that with other scientists ? 
  claiming that doctors are wrong , chemists do n't know what they are talking about . 
  admittedly , social sciences are more difficult to predict but that does n't mean we ca n't . 
  so , basically you and the eurozone are ignoring what science say because of faith . 
  and , yes , experiments has been done and they did n't turn out well . 
   also , how on earth , are you going to get china , japan , us , canada etc to obey , and not make money out of it ? 
  that 's a good point . 
  obviously , if everyone plays greedily in this scenario you end up with europe losing money and the others profiting from it . 
  but that 's like saying that if one country unilaterally outlaws slavery , then all others will profit from the extra workforce while that country 's economy suffers . 
  clearly , sometimes it is possible to get countries to cooperate for some joint good . 
  second , you ca n't ignore the fact that china , canada , etc are not playing with merkozy . 
  you have to solve that first , or the trading will just move . 
  china is not lying awake thinking of the greater good of europe you are saying taxes = good . 
  that is simply not true , not at all . 
  there are a million scenarios when this does n't hold true , more often than not i 'd say . 
  you are also saying that all of a sudden that all of the eurozone , that up until know have behaved irresponsibly , all of a sudden would turn around and act like selfless , good people , just wanting to help . 
  that is the most unlikely scenario i 've ever heard about . 
  so , italy is going to be free from corruption from now on . 
  no more billions down the drain ? 
   we did not fuck up the fact of the matter is that everyone fucked up , when we decided to open up our economies so much without providing some more integration .

  in fact anyone who could move would do so . 
  would n't you do the same thing ? 
  if you translate it to english it would be : `` you ca n't eat the cake and keep it at the same time . '', 
  for the last 5 years i 've always seen merkel and sarkozy together on tv leading the eu and taking responsibility . 
  i 've rarely seen gordon brown or david cameron together with other eu leaders trying to resolve the problems with the union . 
  the uk , one of the largest nations in the union , has failed to show any type of leadership . 
  they 're always whining and complaining like a spoiled baby about everything with the union instead of taking leadership and responsibility to contribute to fixing it . 
  even though they are not part of the euro they should try to influence the eu . 
  i 'm almost certain that they could if they actually tried . 
  the uk has to either start taking responsibility and lead europe or exit the union . 
  they ca n't eat the cake and keep it at the same time . 
  edit : grammar, 
  iirc there was a thread on reddit that turkey jails very many journalists . 
  personally i think croatia and other southern eastern european countries should be allowed to join if they meet all the criteria . 
  turkey might join , but most probably not in the next 20 or 30 years . 
  jobbik is not in power in hungary . 
  if they ever become a government party then they will most likely face sanctions . 
  remember that austria is a lot better off economically than greece or hungary . 
  i do n't know exactly how the political system in greece works and i also i do n't know how much other parties hate the golden dawn but if the system is anything like the swedish one then there is a possibility of having a socialdemocratic-conservative coalition ( or similar ) . 
  other countries have had these types of unusual coalitions . 
  i think it 's important for political parties to be able to put their differences aside and cooperate if such an extremist party would gain considerable influence . 
  however if they some how get 51 % of the vote then greece will face boycotts and economic sanctions from eu countries . 
  typical swedish double standards . 
  we do n't like tobacco companies , unless we 're selling . 
  there can never be too much x-com, 
  most probably because these are poor areas where many poor immigrants or danes with immigrant background live . 
  when this happens they socialize mostly with people from their own culture leading to segregation . 
  segregation slows down integration which keeps them in poverty . 
  poor people are are also more likely to commit crimes . 
  because segregated immigrants look different , do n't socialize with the majority , and because many of them are poor and commit crimes may lead to racism from the majority which in return has an equal reaction to the victims . 
  there are also other factors which can lead to racism such as political instability , problems in individual lives ( drugs , alcoholism , bad or no family , debt , depression , etc. ), 
  which bring these individuals into far-right groups , or just plain ignorance . 
  the vast majority of people do n't want to live in these types of neighborhoods . 
  people who can afford living somewhere else will . 
  another problem is that newspapers love to write about silly `` sensationalist '' articles because they sell . 
  they write a lot more often when an immigrant commits a crime than when a swede commits one . 
  the newspaper would only be filled with crimes if they reported every single rape , abuse , murder , and theft . 
  at the same time they condemn nationalist parties and spread their `` politically correct propaganda '' which the nationalists like to call it . 
  the newspapers are a part of the problem . 
  unless it 's a serial killer or a very important person got murdered then it 's not real news . 
  some newspapers write articles which are borderline hate speech . 
  i think the first step would be to teach tolerance at a young age ( and about other cultures ) and at swedish classes for adult immigrants about swedish culture and democratic values , which many immigrants do n't know well because they 're from dictatorships . 
  the second step would be request media to stop writing `` sensationalist '' articles and whenever they want to condemn nationalist parties and their opinions then they should do it properly , also not to mention these newspapers should stop writing articles and posting `` art '' which are borderline hate speech . 
  the third step is to get unemployment down as much as possible , especially in poor segregated for obvious reasons even if it 's crap jobs . 
  also some immigrants have a higher education but they 're from universities which are not approved of in europe . 
  why not have a fast `` re-education '' in swedish or english for these people to prove their knowledge and that they can work as doctors or scientists in our society . 
  the goal should be to educate people as much as possible , especially the people with no education whatsoever . 
  these people need to feel welcome . 
  if they want a place of worship then they should have one . 
  if i was a christian or a jew and i lived in a country with few churches or synagogues i would feel extremely welcome if i would be given a place of worship . 
  nobody should be forced to give up their culture ( assimilation ) because they are living in a foreign country , however they should be a part of our society ( integrated ) and lead normal lives . 
  also we must not forget that very many immigrants are actually living normal lives . 
  there are n't very many of these types of slums in our country . 
  if you look at other countries in the world they are many times worse off than we are . 
  the 're many people who 've lived generations in their countries and they still live in slums . 
  some of these types of comments which i 've written now tend to get downvoted . 
  if you disagree then you 're welcome to discuss this with me in a reply . 
  you actually went back 4 months in his post history looking for him to state what political ideology he follows . 
  creepy . 
  [ ingrid carlqvist also said ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69be-7apera ), 
  they have to put up with bullshit either way . 
  of course you can counter protest , but it 's not your responsibility because it does n't really have to do with you . 
  i understand that you are concerned . 
  xenophobic people are a lot louder on the internet than people who are n't . 
  here in sweden you will find plenty of people who do n't mind from what background you 're from . 
  of course there are people who unfortunately do n't like muslims but they are a minority who are very loud on the internet . 
  at least it was like this when i was in high school ( which was not very long ago ) and among my friends today . 
  thank you for your input . 
  what is your opinion about the xenophobia on this subreddit and what i was discussing earlier about ? 
  you never know when sweden will join the euro . 
  i have no doubts that it will within 20 years . 
  maybe norwegian crowns are better considering it 's not part of the eu . 
  i would also like to add that you did n't reply or comment to my question about bosnia and albania . 
  why would you `` love '' see them protest about that ? 
  it has absolutely nothing to do with them . 
   i rather not to , i mean , sweden 's fine but i do n't think i 'd manage . 
  i hope that 's a bad joke . 
   indeed . 
  the only difference which is the problem me and others are bringing up is that the people who run the stanley cup does n't advocate violence and they do n't teach and reward the people who go there to be obedient and to follow their teachings and much less to go out of their way and force others into it . 
  with regards to islam , that ca n't be said , they actively suppress dissenting voices and they are more than willing to use violence to achieve their goals . 
  the nhl is a business and want to make money so they obviously do n't advocate violence , however the riot was most likely planned whether they would win or lose . 
  who is `` they '' ? 
  i personally do n't know any muslims who advocate violence . 
  i also believe that most muslims and imams do n't advocate violence because the large majority are n't extremists and live normal lives and are normal people . 
  muslims , just like us , are individuals and they do n't have a common goal as you seem to suggest . 
  my argument is that there are assholes everywhere in every group . 
  that 's why there is a minority of muslims in western europe who want sharia become violent if it does n't go their way . 
  here in sweden we have nazis who march through the city every year during the national day and they are escorted by the police for everybody 's safety . 
  how many muslims were violent in paris ? 
  and how many muslims live in paris and/or france ? 
  the majority of muslims most likely did n't care about the video or thought it was disrespectful . 
   oh , so because you know some muslims and they 're fine , all muslims and islam as an ideology are fine . 
  wow , i feel much safer already . 
  if you feel threatened ( or not `` safe '' ) by muslims then it might be time to go and meet new people , or why not move to a muslim country for half a year ? 
   and there were also attempts for such protests here in europe as well , greece and france come to mind , so the political instability and poverty is n't the cause of it but rather why they proved to be so deadly - as there was n't the security to prevent it . 
  greece is n't that politically stable considering their economy , the rise of the golden dawn with their connection to the police . 
  i do n't know about france but i will take your word for it . 
  if the same amount of people were going to go out and be that violent in western european countries the military would have to most likely be dispatched . 
  the people involved in these protests are most likely uneducated and have a pretty bad life . 
  how much violence was there in bosnia or albania , both countries which have a substantial muslim population ?

  it 's more an issue with culture and such and actually owning your place . 
  if you have a steady income you 'll probably be able to sublet , but it 's usually pretty disadvantageous and can be a bit ... meh . 
  people also live at home longer than we have in the past ( there 's a bit of a stigma against that here ) . 
  roommates are n't super common compared to some other countries , we 're pretty individualistic people . 
  the waiting time for a place in cities like stockholm stretches upwards to 20 years . 
  that 's the main issue . 
  uncommon outside of the nordic countries possibly , but i do n't know any name that 'd only exist in sweden . 
  popular names ( top 100 in sweden ) that may potentially be limited to the nordics ( ? 
  ) : - ** \u00c5ke ** ( \u00c5ge , aage ) : derived from medieval ` anicho ' , `` ancestor '' . 
  - ** kjell ** ( kjeld , keld ) : from old norse ` k\u0119till ' ( `` cauldron , helmet '' ) . 
  - ** h\u00e5kan ** ( haakon , h\u00e5kon , hakon ) : probably from old norse ` h\u00e1 konr ' , `` high son '' . 
  - ** rune ** : from old norse ` r\u00fan ' , `` secret '' ( yes , same origin as ` runes ' . 
  not pronounced like that though ) . 
  - ** b\u00f6rje ** ( b\u00f8rge ) : variation of * birger * ( maybe birger fits too ? 
  ) , from old norse ` bjarga ' , `` to help , to protect '' . 
  - ** \u00c5sa ** ( \u00c5se ) : from old norse ` asa ' , `` goddess '' . 
  - ** gun ** ( gunn ) : from old norse ` gunnr ' , `` battle , war '' . 
  edit : added some etymologies and danish/norwegian spellings for anyone interested . 
  it feels a bit ineffective and unnecessarily bureaucratic at times . 
  and going abroad you realize how expensive stuff can sometimes be here . 
  the lack of housing is also a pain in the arse , but i do n't know if that 's a consequence of the nordic system or just sweden things . 
  i would n't give it up though . 
  i 'm getting an education , have zilch in debt , and if shit were to hit the fan i know there 's a safety net to catch me . 
  ^ ( edit : grammar fixes ), 
  i do n't think that 's limited to places with universal healthcare , it 's a pretty universal complaint . 
  anecdotally , the longest waiting time i 've personally encountered was in the us . 
  he does n't really represent any constituency . 
  the prime minister is n't elected by votes . 
  his seat in parliament is from stockholm 's constituency , yes , but being the prime minister he 's currently off his duty as member of parliament . 
  and the description `` which constituency they had represented in their country during their election '' is n't necessarily accurate as there is n't an election for the position . 
  anyway , since you 've written it i assume you have a source , but since you have n't linked anything [ here 's one ] ( https://www.riksdagen.se/en/members-and-parties/member/stefan-lofven_ac737989-5fa0-44bc-ad69-c1a0ddba71bb ) in case you do n't . 
  it may , i do n't know enough about the netherlands to confirm . 
  we do n't use formal/polite pronouns , titles , last names , or any of that type of formality at all since the reform . 
  not even during formal occasions . 
  with the exception of the king , you 'd ` du ' everyone even at things like the nobel banquet . 
  we do . 
  they 're not ubiquitous , but libraries , schools , sporting facilities etc. 
  may have them . 
  an officially supported cultural shift ? 
  but no , i guess more of a cultural shift . 
  there was n't any law change or such . 
  long story short : it started a few years earlier with some workplaces adapting the policy , but what 's called the `` du-reform '' came into place in 1967 with a policy of the head of the national board of health . 
  this then spread to the other governmental organs , and eventually it had trickled down to everyone else . 
  it did take about ten years until everyone was comfortable with it . 
  also , it can be noted it does n't apply to royals in official settings nor when addressing the speaker in parliament . 
  -- edit : there 's apparently a [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/du-reformen ) , if you 're really curious . 
  we do n't have one since the `` du-reform '' in the 60s/70s . 
  it 's ` du ' ( you ) or first name . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kmuwxluoyg that 's the highest placed swedish song on the charts here currently . 
  i do n't listen much to popular music myself , so i do n't really know much else . 
  is n't ` ombudsman ' used in russian too ? 
  no , no . 
  that 's not at all what i meant !, 
  i just wanted to explain why i found it unnecessarily convolute . 
  apologies if i 'm inarticulate and it came across as something else . 
  dear god , i do n't think it offends anyone . 
  i just did n't want others to be misled about the meaning and without context i think it may . 
  that is n't any better for me either . 
  k\u00f8benhavn or k\u00f6penhamn , i really do n't care . 
  but those weird mixtures ... man , they 're horrible . 
   k\u00f8penhamn that spelling is making me feel oddly uneasy . 
  it 's some kind of uncanny valley shit . 
  more accurately they 're named after the eponymous mine next to the village , where they were all discovered . 
  holmium was also discovered there ( ytterby lies in the stockholm archipelago ) . 
  in addition to those five , four other elements found in the mine : - scandium ( named after scandia ( latin for scandinavia ) ) - thulium ( after thule ( believed to have been another latin word for scandinavia ) ) - gadolinium ( after chemist johan gadolin who discovered yttrium there ) - tantalum ( after tantalus in greek mythology , unrelated to the ytterby ), 
  when you churn butter small lumps of butter forms and floats on the surface of the milk , these lumps were called `` butter geese '' . 
  that meaning then extended to all butter , and since you put the butter on sandwiches , soon the entire sandwich was referred to as ` butter goose ' . 
  has little to do with actual geese ( other than the fact that they also float ) . 
  ` sandwich ' actually comes from the english town of the same name , or rather its [ earl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_montagu,_4th_earl_of_sandwich ) who supposedly invented it . 
  not to my knowledge , no . 
  and if you meant that as some stereotypical implication that i 'd lack humour , i do n't . 
  it 's just that most people here do not speak swedish and it 's a bit unnecessary and misleading to translate it like that , just for the sake of being weird . 
  sure , it can be whimsical and fun for us who speak the language . 
  but it 's not very nice to mislead others who may not know that sm\u00f6rg\u00e5s means sandwich and may take your translation at face value . 
  no , it 's swedish for ` sandwich table ' . 
  the fact that `` sandwich '' can be broken down further into ` butter goose ' , does n't mean that that 's what the ` sm\u00f6rg\u00e5s ' of ` sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord ' stands for . 
  that 's a different matter and saying so is just convoluting it excessively . 
  sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord means ` sandwich table ' . 
  also they do n't use falukorv . 
  it 's ... * okay * . 
  better than starving , but not something i 'd serve the king . 
  yeah , it 's like traveling activates our viking genes or something . 
  it 's obviously very different from person to person . 
  but , in general , yes . 
  til i 'm german . 
  i have jack wolfskin stuff and always wait for green . 
  is it because people believe it 's bad for their health ? 
  we 've had criticism of palm oil here , but it 's all because of how horrendous its production is for the environment . 
  not an health issue . 
  i feel like our `` regions '' are being a bit overstated , i mean they cooperate . 
  for example , the travel card i used in j\u00f6nk\u00f6ping can be used for trips to , from , and within the six southernmost ` regions ' of sweden . 
  that 's an area larger than the whole kingdom of the netherlands . 
  and since it includes trips to , and from those six regions , it can be used elsewhere for taking a trip , or going back home . 
  i mean i 've used that card to go to , and from , copenhagen and that * is * a different country . 
  the reason we have those regions is to decentralize and allow each region to have better control of their public transport . 
  it 's more difficult for someone sitting in stockholm to know wither h\u00f6\u00f6r needs an extra bus line and allocate resources for that , than it is for someone already in scania . 
  wait , so is it a brand like mastercard or visa or do you call all debit cards with pins `` pin '' ? 
  sweden 's a mostly cashless society , i only carry a debit card . 
  the busses and trains of most ( all ? ), 
  regions , have their own system with contactless travel cards .

  sadly , i have to emphasize on the idea that i 'm pro-eu and pro-schengen ** but ** there are groups , cultural or ideological that do no have a place in this modern world were we continue to meld . 
  i 'd really like for them to be a part of the future though . 
  same here . 
  i thought it would be a place to escape the left and right media bias but as all facist playgrounds , it just means no reality that does n't fit my rightwing bias . 
  i remember during the us election cycle , it was all anti-hillary and no anti-trump . 
  i mean , yeah , there was lots of shit on hillary and rightfully so but come the fuck on . 
  there 's no bigger pile of shit than trump . 
  uncensorednews is a t_d sub though . 
  it has about the same type of moderation as the main sub . 
  i 've given up on subs with a specific politocal orientation . 
  both left and roght political subs on reddit is such a heap of shit . 
  when people are civilized and ca n't have civilized conversations , they come to civilized subs . 
  i think you underestimate how bad some countries are and how far their prooaganda reaches . 
  lets say that / r/russia or / r/turkey was moddee by a team that was pro-west and banned anyone that was n't . 
  how pissed would n't you be ? 
  i 'm curious what you mean . 
  it 's a defensiv pact , no ? 
  well they do n't share the idea of peace or moral . 
  that 's pretty clear . 
  i 'm usually very level headed but i see less and less a place for islam and religion and those who practice it in this modern world . 
  problem is though . 
  say that we solve it by cutting away the cancer as it is . 
  how long will it take untill skin colour is the reason . 
  i do n't know if stupidity ends where islam ends . 
  so you say ? 
  i feel that we need less facism in europe though . 
  hope they get zero seats . 
  edit : i triggered a lot of snowflakes . 
  i replied to a dumb opinion with another dumb opinion . 
  but i 'll be honest . 
  if the torries win , i hope you lose all your rights to eu and you deserve the facist distopia that follows the torries rules . 
  extensive spying by both cctv and wiretapping the internet . 
  it 's straight out of fucking 1984 and you people are just smiling because fuck brown people right ? 
  i get it . 
  i 'd love a closed eu border too and the muslims kept in their litterbox but i wo n't terrorism for facism . 
   those who would give up essential liberty , to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety . 
  you know this very well and if you think for once , you 'll know what it means for you in 2017 aswell . 
  that 's not really an argument . 
  it 's just another version of `` because '' . 
  well that 's neat as shit . 
  i always pictures ukraine as a black forest with obvious plains . 
  they ca n't . 
  brexxiters is as classy as trumpets . 
  one chromosome heavy and in a dorito/mountain dew fueled frenzy . 
  because they 're most likely not turkish . 
  ask the salty fuckers at / r/the _ dumbfuck . 
  this is very conflicting for me as a left leaning person . 
  i 'm not against helping others or immigration but seriously . 
  abuse the system like this and ypu deserve to sink in the sea . 
  not a facist state !, 
  brexit was n't power grab based on racism !, 
  / s i love you brit-bongs but what 's going on is n't healthy . 
  you know what a healthy democracy looks like . 
  we have had cia swoop people from sweden before . 
  not something he would risk and i agree with him . 
  sweden can be pretty fucking shady at times . 
  you will always see the loudest and the dumbest defend the most disgusting people . 
  once you mix nationalism into your sense of pride , logic is the fist to go . 
  i 've gotten scorned everytime i tell you guys that brexit was based on nothing more than a racist agenda . 
  if there had not been a migrant crisis and a zombie apocalypse like invasion in the tunnel , there would n't even be a refendrum . 
  france/brits . 
  got ta googla that one . 
  nato ( as in every fucking one ) . 
  the us took down japan in ww2 though . 
  you did n't have anything to do with that though . 
  i 'm sure having you involved would have given the japs the victory . 
  i really love these kinds of housings . 
  every new neighbourhood tendd to be built in american style standard where the clone tool is abused . 
  seriously guys . 
  stop treating us as the only intelligence service in the world . 
  they 're good allies with lots of new tools but we do n't need them . 
  we can do without even if we go at half speed and it 's not forever and all intelligence . 
  just till trump and the nazi party is out of office . 
  is njet rojshan hax !, 
  tackar and thank you . 
  technical translations is n't always easy . 
  either wind powered electricity or power from recyceling plants here in the southern flatlands . 
  is `` fj\u00e4rrv\u00e4rme '' the same as geothermal heating ? 
  because of so , that too . 
  trust me . 
  we all feel that way . 
  i 'm not going to argue at lengths about immigration but most of the uks immigrants comes from former colonies like india and pakistan . 
  everyone have shady poles and gypsies and that 's an economic issue that will still presist because you ca n't close your borders despite what you think . 
  it 's physically impossible . 
  why do you think we laugh at trump ? 
  regarding the 4th reich . 
  by far and wide , yes . 
  the mass exedous these last years made it appearant that merkel had waaay too much to say about things and she was the one of the strongest catalyst to uks racist brexit voters . 
  that 's why many of us now support a eu reform . 
  uk leaving did n't hurt eu at any economic or political level but emotionally . 
  it 's a good wake up call and i do n't think you get to insult that but in my own experience , the rightwing politics that uk now ride out on , builds on and makes their supporters only spew insults and nationalistic dreams of the past . 
  like say ww2 germany and trumps usa . 
  i wholeheartedly feel sad for those that ca n't imagen a future that has n't passed . 
  maybe i 'm just being idealistic ... 
  i do n't see anyone refuting the idea with anything other than feelings . 
  because a retarded post deserves nothing vetter than a retarded awnser . 
  also , uks whole detatchment from their eu allies revolves around masturbaiting over nationalistic and dead dreams about the glory days and the empire . 
  brits still friends in my eyes but when people like cbfw86 comes along , i do n't mind hitting them where it hurts . 
  most refugees tend to go for places that hand out pure cash . 
  they want to be able to wire the money home to their relatives .

  the implied answer being that citizens in the western world are * innocent until proven guilty * , and so someone 's legal rights ca n't be taken away on a mere suspicion . 
  was that a response to my comment ? 
  maybe . 
  the analysis i 've read says that planning of terror attacks today is often orchestrated/directed by people in other countries , making the internet a necessity . 
  but it 's hard to assess how many conversations are held offline . 
   hard to plot anything when you are stuck in your house 24/7 wait , what ? 
  that 's obviously not true , it is well known that the bulk of radicalisation and planning is done online . 
   most of them probably were just guys with radical views that had no intention of making an attack i agree with this part . 
  wow . 
  talk about missing the point . 
  the important word was n't `` jihadi , '' the important word was `` suspected . '', 
  but it 's still not possible to actually do it on a regular basis . 
  there are n't enough police , they do n't have the resources , they do n't have the facilities to lock up or investigate so many . 
  thank you , it 's nice with some good news for a change . 
  welp . 
  i guess it 's time to leave / r/europe as a lost cause . 
  that 's the problem then , a statement without a reputable source is just a piece of opinion , not a fact . 
  googling is n't feasible , since one will find any number by googling . 
  if i start looking around the internet for estimates of how many refugees sweden receive yearly i will probably find some websites that says `` none '' and some that will give an answer in the millions . 
  did any of them link to a source ? 
  bring up whatever estimates you want , as long as it is based on actual statistics and polls made by reputable sources . 
  if you just pull numbers out of your ass , like people generally do in the migration debate , your post will be downvoted and possibly even deleted . 
  of course there are evidence , because they are doing it in public . 
  they did n't post any information about where migrants are living until about a month ago , then the fires started burning every other night . 
  some of the buildings were in use , and some were empty and intended for use . 
  arson against the ones with people sleeping inside them are of course infinitely worse , but the attacks against some of the empty ones are more telling in this instance : many of them were just regular buildings owned by the city , and no work had been done to convert them into living space yet . 
  no signs where it said `` migrants here , '' nothing . 
  so how did the perpetrators know what to burn down ? 
  because the sweden democrats have published lists of intended asylum shelters online . 
  recently , migrationsverket ( the migration agency ) decided that the exact location of new shelters must be confidential because of security reasons . 
  but sd has n't stopped posting the locations , they are leaking the info because they , in their own words , do n't agree with the decision . 
  very responsible for a political party to undermine a government agency trying to carry out its orders , yes ? 
  there is absolutely no legitimate reason for them to post the exact addresses ( with street view pictures and maps ) in the way they are doing . 
  they say that it 's in the interest of `` transparency , '' so that people can `` let their opinions about the shelters be heard . '', 
  that 's obviously bullshit , because there 's no need for addresses/pictures/maps if that was the case : just write that 10 new asylum shelters are planned , and if people do n't like that then they will protest . 
  no need for addresses to protest , that 's only required if one wants to set fire to the places . 
  they clearly are n't doing it in order to have rallies or demonstrations at the sites , because they have n't organised any demonstrations . 
  i ca n't see the difference . 
  everyone knows who are encouraging the attacks and guiding arsonists to their next targets . 
  pretty obvious difference , the new pictures are in colour . 
  sorry if i spoiled it for anyone !, 
   the argument you are making is usually an argument made by people who do n't really know the teaching/history of christianity , or any other religion . 
  it 's perfectly fine to be atheist , just keep in mind though that you probably only have a cursory knowledge of religion if you have n't spent any time actually studying them or practicing said religion . 
  yes , i should have been more careful . 
  on the other hand , i said it in response to a post where a * non-muslim * made exactly the same type of generalised remarks about islam , assuming that every muslim follows the quran , and that only a minority `` cherry-picks . '', 
  his knowledge about islam and my knowledge about christianity should be comparable , i think ? 
  well , i would n't know the details of it , since i do n't believe in any gods . 
  from my perspective it looks like cherry-picking , and i usually hear christians describe it as such ( they often say that `` naturally '' they have to cherry-pick , since half the verses in the bible are so outdated and do n't apply to our current society ) . 
  maybe these people are so `` bad '' at being christians that they 're not even right in this explanation !, 
  very possible . 
  every muslim i know ( that i have asked ) are very against sharia law since they consider it barbaric . 
  then again , those muslims are either born in sweden or came here at a young age and has grown up here , so they 're obviously `` westernised . '', 
  i 'm sure i 'd get different answers if i travelled down to syria or something to ask people . 
  that 's true , though the same holds for christians . 
  almost all christians today are `` bad '' at following their own religion since they cherry-pick what they like from the bible . 
  and thank god , no pun intended , as i 'd be dead otherwise . 
  among many other things , the bible states that the penalty for a child disagreeing with his/her parents is death by stoning . 
  i 'm swedish , and i know exactly how * br\u00e4nnboll * is played , can someone eli5 the differences between baseball and br\u00e4nnboll ? 
  we 'll simply have to wait and see what happens in the coming decades . 
  it 's an interesting subject , so i 'd be following it anyway . 
  in this instance , extremely likely . 
  this is psychology we 're talking about . 
  the field is built on our preconceptions , which inevitably are more coloured by cultural norms than we would like . 
  this is the reason that psychological diagnoses can change so much in such a short span of time . 
  people have n't changed , but our conceptions about what is sick and what is n't have . 
  and the fact of the matter is that if someone says `` paedophile '' everyone thinks of a man abusing children . 
  a related question then , do all paedophiles abuse children ? 
  of course not , having an urge and acting on it is not the same thing . 
  do we know how many of these `` silent '' paedophiles there are ? 
  no , not even close , the stigma around paedophilia is fucking * huge * , which means that those paedophiles who never do anything never come forward either . 
  so we know that the number of unrecorded cases is huge , the real figure is bound to be a lot larger than what we see . 
  now to women then , why do we see fewer * recorded * cases of female paedophiles ? 
  because it 's a feedback loop , society does n't think that women `` can '' be paedophiles , so a woman with those urges are even less likely than a man to come forward , and when no female paedophiles are reported it strengthens the tendency !, 
  and there 's even a chance that she is less likely than a man to act on it ( it has been shown that men are more likely than women to act on urges and impulses , in other scenarios ) . 
  understand , i 'm not making a prediction to say that there are just as many male and female paedophiles . 
  maybe there are , maybe there are n't , i do n't know and i * ca n't * know at this time . 
  i 'm only saying that there are a number of reasons that our data is shit , and so we should avoid drawing conclusions from it . 
   strict patient-doctor confidentiality rules mean the men can be assured they will not be reported to the police . 
  um , i should hope not . 
  for what crime would they be reported ? 
  it 's written like it is the very soul of generosity to * not * report law-abiding citizens to the police . 
  but that does n't say anything . 
  the books only takes into account how many men/women have been diagnosed with paedophilia ( at the time of their writing , no less ) . 
  and since we 're discussing the possibility that female paedophiles are being underdiagnosed , it does n't help at all to look at statistics of diagnostics . 
  it 's just circular logic . 
  it 's meant for like 16-18 year olds . 
  i 'll start a nation-wide campaign !, 
  better use kickstarter . 
  i know . 
  fair enough , you did colonise part of it !, 
  part of england i mean . 
  as in a part of britain , but it so happens to actually be located in england proper . 
  eeeh , yes . 
  though my main point was n't that we do n't * know * the difference , of course we do , but people are just careless about the difference in speech . 
  if we 'd all be * proper * we 'd have a special term for the uk , as opposed to great britain , and i 'm guessing you do n't have that in denmark either . 
  in swedish it would be f\u00f6renade kungariket , sounds horrible !, 
  do you say holland or the netherlands ? 
  it 's the same thing . 
  oh , i hope you 're not under the impression that we do n't * know * . 
  of course everybody knows , we too have geography .

cant answer for the rest of the countries but my anecdotal experience in sweden are immigrants from russia are chechen or other minorities ( that often do not get asylum ) and roma coming from serbia . 
  [ oh you want more ? 
  this in on one of their demonstrations . 
  ] ( http://skola.expo.se/images/tl_sd_07_1994.jpg ) you racist apologist will never quit . 
  the difference is that one is joke in bad taste and the other is a genuine opinion . 
  [ this ] ( http://skola.expo.se/images/tl_sd_09_1996.jpg ) was how one of the members looked in the 90s while their current leader joined the party . 
  and [ this ] ( https://cdn3.cdnme.se/cdn/6-1/841033/images/2010/sverigedemokraterna_108503051.jpg ) was the posters during the same time . 
  on the bottom it says :  varning !, 
   to swedish girls !, 
   avoid unprotected sex with negros that carries the deadly aids virus !, 
  preferably : do not dishonour your race , your sweden , your family and relatives . 
  yeah , they 're just a bit center right . 
  the were communists historically but now socialist/social democratic . 
  what facts are twisted and how does it work ? 
  to me this is a fair representation although tongue in cheek . 
  ah , so that is what tevez is doing on his time off during the wc . 
  good for you , keeping yourself busy and organizing a human trafficking ring in north africa . 
  interesting to compare the forecast to reality . 
  it shows that sweden came in 7th place 2009 and in the latest in 2013 , in 8th place . 
  there is a reason why the page on forecast for hdi are deleted from wikipedia . 
  well the result i 've seen from that culture when i visit friends and family from southern/eastern europe is that 26 year old still lives at home and puts every bit of money on a car that is too expensive for them while wearing fake designer clothes . 
  on the other hand , the same bragging culture exist in sweden only that people brags about how healthy they are , how well they raises their children , how much they work out and how politically aware they are . 
  we have more of an social media facade than an street facade . 
  i get about $ 1000 each month but i think the cost of living is a bit higher here . 
  maybe its because i have cheap rent but for me thats enough and beyond . 
   the casualty figures for the whole of yugoslavia sways between the maximum 1,700,000 and the more conservative figures between 1,500,000 . 
  [ 99 ] or one million . 
   they should be honest and just admit that the reason why he was fined is simply because they disallow `` hate speech '' , whether his sayings are backed by fact or not . 
  the court commented on the report that hess submitted and they nullified it . 
  they wrote that the one single paper is not solid evidence of a commonly admitted truth of any form . 
  but the far-right page that ops link sources failed to include that for some reason . 
  no , he did not . 
  he submitted what he claims to be proof but was nullified by the [ court ] ( http://www.expressen.se/kvallsposten/sd-politiker-i-ratten-for-hets-mot-folkgrupp/ ) . 
   does this law apply to radical muslims who do hate speech towards other minorities too ? 
  yes of course , [ one example ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ahmed_rami_\\ ( writer \\ ) ), 
  this is what you initially wrote :  this means in practice that a ** russian guy ** can come up to me '' pretty singular ? 
  my initial point is that your example when you discredit russians in front of a russian is false and would not be included in the law against hate speech . 
  that is backed up by the example when a 16 year old was acquitted for doing a hitler salute . 
  a insult of miscredit aimed towards a small group of russians or one single isnt enough to be included , at least according to the the professional lawyers of the court but you probably know better right ? 
  if you just took this as an adult you could 've admitted that your example is wrong and this could have taken about 1 minute instead . 
   if you can read you can clearly see that wikipedia say they 're connected to the arab/kurdish culture . 
  no , one of the sources claims that . 
  here is a source that says its a culture spread all over the world : [ source ] ( http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/212/readings/honor-kil-ng.pdf ) now you got your sources , fine scholar . 
   it could be but you 're assuming things ( in my case no it was n't private ) no you clearly wrote russian and not russians . 
  so in your scenario it was you and one other russian . 
  you have to target a greater group and do it on a public forum aiming to reach to a lot of people . 
  tired of people trying to discredit a law they even do n't fully understand . 
  i have n't argued that the honour killings does n't exist , so no need to show me anymore wiki pages . 
  i discussing the reason for it , countless regions all over the world greatly oppresses females and have done long before islam and span all over the world . 
  you are not stating your point and what you agues for . 
  the article quotes are just historic statements . 
  how is that not a private discussion ? 
  and if you say it to one specific person it is not included in the law , even if you are out in the public . 
  you must aim it to a group that you slander and not just a single person . 
   perhaps but why should we care about your opinion ? 
  if you want to dispute the grounds your best bet is facts . 
  saying it 's your opinion does n't make it true , and it does n't prove it either . 
  wikipedia is a good first step . 
  [ 1 ] oh a link to the wiki-page of what honor killings is ? 
  so for my feebly functioning mind , maybe can get the slightest grasp of the term and get back in the game again with the great thinker and scholar that is yourself ? 
  a greatly tipped fedora my dear sir . 
   they 're way more prevalent in certain regions and religions . 
  they are more prevalent in undeveloped countries and regions , yes . 
  but what is your point ? 
  let me guess : its the muslims and arabs !, 
  no , because you said `` asshat '' to a russian in a private discussion and therefore it does not qualify as hate speech . 
  the problem here is archaic/obsolete behaviors that are not specific to any regions or religions . 
  this `` honor killing '' is going on in albania , kurdistan and india and are in my opinion a result of female oppression . 
  not really . 
  `` asshat '' would hardly count as hate speech and when people get convicted its usually on good grounds . 
  saying that muslims have a deeply rooted culture of raping non-believers is n't anywhere near `` asshat '' . 
  but are n't you only focusing on dishes and where they 're originated from ? 
  traditional cooking is n't all food culture . 
  ah , another one that only visited stockholm . 
  there are scandinavian restaurants all around the world . 
  modern scandinavian cooking is very much popular and highly regarded around the world . 
  just look at the bocuse dor winners , only scandinavians and french for almost 25 years . 
  that was n't a border guard . 
  that was the migrant reception centre , they were already on spanish soil . 
  its not considered a aphrodisiac , that 's an old myth . 
  well you did say  it 's like calling for trouble that is like saying she called for the rape by getting lost . 
  the sick part that i think everybody should focus on is that people still rape and not that people gets lost or makes common mistakes . 
  of course its foolish to just walk about thinking you are completely safe in a poor country but i was just puling your leg about the `` armed security '' part , which is a little over the top in my books . 
  if you are careful in india , you are perfectly safe and wont need an army with you . 
  or when we talk about a rape we can instead focus on the fact that people still do that to other people . 
  instead of focusing on the victim and laying blame there . 
  are you really serious ? 
  negative , this is alpha eagle requesting armed security or ap/at back-up asap regarding a freedom convoy in brown country . 
  engage in all hostile activity . 
  the really 90s seems to be the heyday of german music . 
  but if you listen to industrial music or ( minimal ) techno , germany is the place to be . 
  also : dont forget that boney m are german . 
  do the spanish royalties have legal immunity ? 
  you said  2008 was a year with way fewer immigrants than most other years i showed that 2008 was a year with less immigrants than usual . 
  you want more examples ? 
  lebanon : 39 % syria : 10 % jordan : 6 % there is a lot of christians in the middle east and they are accepted are an integrated part of society . 
  no , my number are in general . 
  in 2008 we had 90k new citizens , 2009 98k , 2010 91k , 2011 93k and 2012 111k . 
  so in reality less than 100k in the last few years and 2008 was not a year with fever immigrants . 
  if you look at the refugee quota , 2008 has the highest number since 1980 .

  i know there has been complaints from mostly young entrepreneurs about new rules and taxes that are way too punishing . 
  the government seems to have been forced to back down though after protests from two major groups . 
  brioche does n't make for a good title though . 
  oh gosh , i guess france dos n't have any problems , it is totally keeping up both with german influence and economy . 
  i mean just look at that gini coefficient !, 
  ( and horribly bad comparisons ) . 
  yeah , everything is fine . 
  if we instead look at a real alternative to bnp ( hdi ) we 'll see an exellent result , but nonetheless a result heading in the wrong direction . 
  this partly due to the indications innovation & technology as well as trade , economy and income . 
  fact of the matter is that hollande does not seem to have any direction at home . 
  if france is not to undertake any long term reforms such as those recommended by louis gallois ( see the article ) what would the alternative be , more dirigisme perhaps ? 
  or why not more domestic bailouts such as with psa ? 
  this dos n't change anything though . 
  the 2009 greek deficit of about 14,2 % did n't fall down from the sky one day , it is still a product of greek policies decided on by greek politicians . 
  also , i 've yet to hear a viable alternative to austerity . 
  not yet , but it certanly is n't really going in the right direction now is it , or perhaps france has magically began to reform over night . 
  cute . 
  if you think joining a failing currency union as a very small country ( and in the process losing every fiscal tool avaliable ) seems like good idea then you might wan na stay away from these topics lil boy . 
  it 'll just be an additional burden to re-introduce their own currency again as i see it . 
  so the ez is really desperate for new bailout funds heh . 
  i ca n't see why on earth would latvia join the ez at this time . 
  ah , it is a national trait then . 
  add to that list sports bars in major south european cities :d, 
  i 'll be damned , you 're right . 
  what a dumb change though , making it a less logical name . 
  noted . 
  as someone from scandinavia i ca n't stand the cheek kissing of some countries , to me it is revolting . 
  also , britts ( everyone single one i 've worked with on assignmnets abroad ) complaining about food when they 're abroad . 
  i mean the uk has the worst food in the entire eu * by far * but still you 'll hear consant moan for a cornish pasty or something . 
  this is faux news kinda , i mean even if greece has regained competitiveness due to lower labour unit costs france has a distinct advantage over greece in that it is a stabile and functioning society without the many uncertainties companies would face in greece . 
  it isnt called the * `` council of the eu '' * , rather the official name is * `` the council of ministers '' * . 
  you know the place the coreper i & ii works for . 
  that is not primarily the fault of europe , though we have responsibility . 
  i mean to adress population would require us to talk about the elephant in the room i.e that india , parts of africa , central asia , mexico and some south american countries has to promote significant decreases in their birth rates . 
  in regards to the destruction of nature resources the problem lies primarily with the us , china and india . 
  to sustain the present population in a country a birth rate of 2,1 kids / women is needed . 
  we need it because since if do n't have it we will get even more scewed democraphic make up . 
  also , if we do n't have the `` replentishment '' we can kiss the welfare state and old age benifits and care good bye due to both a lack of tax money and a lack of people to care for the elderly . 
  if we look beyond upper classes et.al . 
  you 'll find that the house wife ideal that is still common in us is n't appealing ( in general ) to european women ( thank god ) . 
  though naturally is varies depending on country and whether you live in a city or rural area . 
  furhtermore , as we can see from statistics , in countries where women have few choises and hence are expected to follow traditions there is a correlation with low birth rates ( see italy , spain and greece ) i.e the house wife ideal is not viable at any level . 
  i mean if europ\u00e9 as a civilization is to remain relevant we have to develop and remain competitive . 
  this both in regards to birth rates ( immigration is not the answer ) and productivity ( increased female participation in the work force ) . 
  for this to happen the single male breadwinner concept has to go once and for all . 
  what we need is increased flexibility for families to combine family life and work , also , this needs to happen on the eu level . 
  europ\u00e9 wide studies shows that european women in general value increased flexibility between their work place and family . 
  hence to bring their small kids to work is something that would be valued by a majority of women . 
  also , if we are to bring birth rates to the required level ( 2,1 child / woman ) this something we have to get used to if we want too see increased birth rates . 
  if you ca n't see their own absurd reasoning for sueing farmers you 're beyond my help . 
  no , i do n't need to change anything i believe . 
  you however seem to be one of these dumb white knights ( us republican ? ), 
  who ca n't see facts right infront of you . 
  you can look at their own home page * for starters , then you can just google and look at what established news outlets has to say . 
  * http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/saved-seed-farmer-lawsuits.aspx, 
  i take it for granted that people are able to process information and decide whether it is false or true . 
  still , it dos n't change the fact that monsanto at best is shady company . 
  do you think that the crop contamination stuff / lawsuits in the us us `` anti ag tech bullshit '' ? 
  your point is ? 
  do you find google to difficult to use ? 
  just type in monsanto and you get a shitstorm of bizzare stuff , like this as an example ; http://www.ibtimes.com/monsanto-protection-act-5-terrifying-things-know-about-hr-933-provision-1156079, 
  it seems to have a nice castle , would be a nice place to visit . 
  good view of the enemy as well !, 
  it is very hot here in sweden as well . 
  i have black leather in my car ... wo n't be nice when i am going home after work  <, 
  i used to date a croatian girl ( dispora ) who liked turbofolk-ish music . 
  i always know that the music is gon na be bad , but it is still impossible to perpare for it haha . 
  i know that estonia in part has been a part of my country for a while * * : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_livonia other than that i know estonia is seen as a stellar reformer in the wake of the crisis . 
  also , tallin is a really nice and picturesque city . 
  hahah , case in point . 
  are you trying to defile my ears ? 
  i hope this list wo n't include listening to turbofolk :d, 
  new sickness ? 
  france has been losing competitiveness for 10 years , at least . 
  what has the leadership done ? 
  kicked the can . 
  i mean hollandes new proposals amounts to lowering the competetiveness of the rest of europ\u00e9 in order to stregthen france . 
  in the end hollande will have to do a turn around like mintterand if france is regain its place alongside germany . 
  those were just examples ( likely ones ) but still just food for thought on the difficulties the ecb might encounter as a lender of last restort if they had to defend a ez wide stimulus . 
  i do think markets expects the ez to muddle through and to continue to kick the can rather than breaking up . 
  true that bail ins / outs will be deprimental , but qe at ez level would have to be underpinned by institutional changes such as an independent authority for a bankning union to back the ecb in times of speculation . 
  this will take some time to achieve . 
  i agree though that something is needed to change market expectations , to kick the can is no longer viable . 
  to pack a punch qe would also have to be decided by the european council at a eu-27 level , this to restore both consumer and market confidence at the eu level . 
  edit : then the question becomes : is there enough political will at eu 27 level ? 
  i doubt it . 
  the question though is whether the ecb in the long run can counteract confidence problems that will arise from divergence in economic preformance at member state level . 
  unless it has the absolute backing of every ez member state regardless of individual member state performance i can see the markets taking aim . 
  such a policy would in effect mean that a independant banking union authority would have to be established to back the ecb up . 
  true , this said the lack of confidence is also partly due to ever present internal rifts in the ez , effectivly making it unable to do anything . 
  this because of national considerations inevitably affecting stances on the ez level . 
  the ez is kinda like a boat without a captain where the helmsman is agruing with the cheif engineer . 
  the mainstream media is n't that much better . 
  your current issues does to a great extent consist of various `` gaffes '' , obstructivist republicans , the absurd sequester or the confusing policies of a president whoes policies all in all are n't that different from those of gwb . 
  if they can find someone who 'll be able to form a viable government perhaps that is possible , 
  indeed , it is all nominal discussions , shots in the dark really . 
  though it easy to see a scenario were a ez wide qe is being implemented , then we will see reports like this ; country a : good progress in both structural and institutional reforms , higher growth , decreased uneployment . 
  country b : moderate progress in structural and institutional reforms , sluggish growth and unchanged unemployment . 
  country c : low progress in structural and institutional reforms , no growth , increased unemployment . 
  now a likely scenario is that country a will be ireland while country b and c will be italy and spain .

  idk if it can or if there will be a scientific proven `` treatment '' in the future but there is no way to prove that it ca n't be changed . 
  and if it could be changed , there is no inherent damage in that . 
  i do n't see anything in the article about it being restricted to children ? 
  anyway , it does not seem to be a ban of the practice , just for medical professional to not prescribe treatment ( of dubious nature ) for something that is not classified as a disability/disease . 
  colongne . 
  throwing acid in women faces . 
  stoning . 
  slicing and sewing up genitalia .

   without evidence heh, 
  i visited naples once . 
  when i was walking down a one way road ( filled with people , market stands , scooters ) i see a car reversing at high speed , right down the road . 
  i guess he really did n't want to drive around the block . 
  honestly though , the people in rome drove like cunts too . 
   b ) its undermining of the monopoly on legitimate use of force of the state . 
  the contract goes both ways , something the states in europe have bee ignoring for far too long . 
  the monopoly is only relevant if the state manages to deter crime . 
  the questions are not connected as a whole . 
  it is composed of several different alternatives . 
  the alternative `` does not resist '' does not contain any implication of inebriation . 
  i understand your confusion but that is not a correct interpretation of that sentence . 
  ` certain situations ' only indicates that the question is composed of several different parts . 
  the actual interpretation in the source is the correct one : `` respondents were asked whether having sexual intercourse without consent was justified in nine different circumstances '' . 
  are you incapable of reading and understanding english ? 
  so kitane is making up a new scenario . 
  well , there is still missing consent between point 4 and 5 . 
  in his scenario , two people have arrived at a home . 
  no information is given of verbal or non verbal consent from that point to the sexual act . 
   i just happen to know the law . 
  laws differ between countries . 
  `` heavy intoxication '' as it 's considered under swedish law does not , afaik , cover situations where people can voice consent but rather situations where the victim is not passed out but delirious and unable to clearly show or give a verbal confirmation of consent . 
  that question is however very badly worded , as it does not describe the level of intoxication . 
   if things lead to sex not in the question . 
   i am talking about all 5 points happening in single scenario with a sexual intercourse as a result . 
  that 's not implied in any way , why would you assume that ? 
  the question does not imply that any verbal or non verbal consent has been given . 
   she 's all over you and comes home with you , does n't say no , lets you lead and does n't fight back . 
  that is not described in the question . 
  is everybody in this thread lacking in reading comprehension ? 
  it 's not implied in the question that any of that has happened . 
  let me give you an example that happened to a friend om mine . 
  at a party she went to bed , a man came into the room , laid down in the bed and proceeded to remove her clothes and insert his penis in her anus . 
  she did not figth back as she froze in fear . 
  clearly a rape . 
  if a woman goes home with you , kissing as so on and hanky panky with to active parties happen there is obviously a non verbal consent , but that is not the situation that the question is about as none of that is mentioned in the question . 
   in my mind , `` does n't say no and does n't fight back either '' is a sign of consent ... am i a rapist ? 
  if we are looking at a situation where she has given no non-verbal communication that she is willing , then yes , you could be . 
  personally i ca n't understand how you can reason that having sex with someone that has not shown any indication of consent is not rape . 
  nothing , but all i could get in italy was coffee , white bread with chocolate on ( ! ), 
  and cigarettes . 
  caffeine , sugar and nicotine - all your body needs !, 
  also , you felt that that was the weird part , not that i made a joke of an entire city ? 
  your driving , your taste in politician , your idea of breakfasts , milan ... ( really though , i feel like an idiot , sorry , although , i was joking too ) . 
  have you ever been drunk off your ass and really hungry ? 
  ( tbh i 've never eaten one , i prefer my kebab in a bread . ), 
  um , do you really feel that this thread is the right place to say that ... 
  because blood sausage and mothafucking lingonsylt !, 
  it 's like someone eating chilis raw and complaining that it 's to strong . 
   fall of nation-states in favour of federal ones , for what reason ? 
  what powers would the nation states give up to the eu that they have not already ? 
  social rights ? 
  not likely . 
  crimes ? 
  abortion rights ? 
  drug regulation ? 
  laughable . 
  taxation ? 
  fuck no . 
  ( ( increased regulatory power of alchohol , firearms and tobacco and similar ? 
  not very likely since the eu have tried to take our systembolag , our snus * and * our rifles ... ) ) why would the smaller countries * ever * give up their independence to be ruled by the populations of frace/germany/italy ? 
  no fucking clue . 
  i mean , sure we are european , but it 's not as if we are very similar . 
  how are our nordic culture similar to say , italy or greece . 
  and then some morons want to get turkey in ... 
   if you 're looking for an equivalent , it would be outlawing child baptism . 
  that is such a dumb argument that i actually am surprised to hear it , even from a genital mutilation apologist . 
   they remove areas of the clitoris and completely change the landscape of the genitalia . 
  nice to see you argue against a strawman . 
  `` removing nerve endings does not reduce sensitivity '' - ya ok , sure mr unbiased american doctor . 
  `` circumcision does n't have anything to do with reducing pleasure '' - except that 's the * only * reason that americans do it . 
  furthermore - do you have any source on your statement - it does n't fit with the narrative of the main religious text - ie the bible . 
  if you where actually informed you would know that there are a multitude of forms of fgm , several which are prohibited in civilized countries , yet are less invasive than mgm . 
  frankly , your comment where a waste of time both to write , read and answer . 
  go fix your ignorance . 
  i mean , what is the difference between cutting away labia minora and the foreskin ? 
  both have integral biological functions , are aesthetically beautiful and are large areas of skin with a multitude of blood vessels and nerve endings . 
  why a special place in hell for one of those procedures ?

   the arson attack had financial support from andreas lindblom , manager of skansen , and paul wretlind , chairman of the stockholm section of the liberal people 's party . 
  the siege of the west german embassy in 1975 by the red army faction , aka the baader-meinhof group . 
  ** 4 people were killed , 2 embassy personnel and 2 perpetrators , an additional 14 people were injured . 
  again , i quote [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_german_embassy_siege ) :  the group consisted of six members : karl-heinz dellwo , siegfried hausner , hanna-elise krabbe , bernhard r\u00f6ssner , lutz taufer and ulrich wessel . 
  they entered the embassy , took thirteen embassy officials , including ambassador dietrich stoecher , hostage ( or twelve officials , according to some sources ) , and then proceeded to occupy the upper floors of the building . 
    they warned swedish police to back off or some hostages would be killed , but the police did not comply and one of the hostages , baron von mirbach , a german military attach\u00e9 was marched out on to the landing and shot to death . 
    the group was then told that chancellor helmut schmidt was not prepared to negotiate with them ; in response , economic attach\u00e9 hillegaart was made to stand at a window and was then shot three times . 
  with the murder of hillegaart , the attackers announced that they would execute one hostage every hour until their demands were met . 
    swedish police prepared to storm the building , but before they had the chance to , the embassy was rocked by a series of violent explosions ; the tnt had been detonated . 
  ulrich wessel dropped a grenade , which detonated and killed him . 
  the remaining hostages , as well as the raf terrorists , all suffered severe burns . 
  siegfried hausner was flown back to west germany , where he soon died of his wounds in prison . 
    the explosion of the embassy was caught on tape . 
  swedish news reporter bo holmstr\u00f6m was standing outside the embassy ready to broadcast when the explosions took off . 
  after taking cover holmstr\u00f6m started yelling `` l\u00e4gg ut , l\u00e4gg ut ! '', 
  ( `` start broadcast , start broadcast ! '' ), 
  to make sure that he was on the air . 
  when he knew he was live he began to report from the events .

  most famous for his actions as the un secretary-general in the early cold war , e.g. 
  his intervention in the 1956 suez crisis , his efforts in defusing the congo crisis , his efforts to smooth relations between israel and the arab states , his conferences in geneva for nuclear disarmament and his negations with china to release the 11 captured us korean war pilots .

  i said there were more after it than before it . 
  which is still wrong . 
  it existed because the serbs were there . 
  bosnia was part of austro-hungary in ww1 and committed genocide , so bosnia should n't exist either then . 
  it has to do with the switch in demographics . 
  serbs were not a majority in bosnia after ww2 . 
   bosnia existed before the world wars , it existed after it . 
  part of austro-hungary and yugoslavia . 
   there were more serbs in bosnia after wwii than before it . 
  nope , but even if they were , it 'd just be shitty border drawing and shows why your borders are fucked and serbs should be let to secede . 
   no areas were ethnically carved out in a quasi-state that continued to exist after wwii . 
  every area was ethnically targeted and called for the extermination of serbs , but were stopped . 
  as for `` existing after ww2 , '' the only thing rs still has from the 90s is the name . 
  please spare me the time by not posting your low effort responses , really a waste of time . 
   because `` muslims '' were forced to say they are serbs in the census no they were n't lol , straight up fucking propaganda . 
  800k muslims yet they were forced to say they were serbs ... okay . 
   also bosniaks were n't allowed to call themselves as bosniaks . 
  sure you were , no one just used those words . 
  everyone called them muslims because it was n't clear cut who was what after ottoman liberation . 
  this was commonplace everywhere , like in crete where all the muslims after liberation were called turks regardless of ethnicity . 
   keep spewing serbian alternative facts please  more like common knowledge . 
  cringey historical accuracy is cringey . 
   they were n't all killed in bosnia . 
  what is wrong with you ??? 
  30k bosniaks were n't killed in modern day rs either , but rather all over the country . 
  shitty argument after shitty argument . 
  nowhere , so why do you mention it ? 
   i suppose you have to mention every other instance on earth when talking about a certain topic or else you 're a `` hypocrite '' ? 
  quit your bullshit . 
  it 's called being consistent ; not having double standards . 
  probably a foreign concept to you . 
   germans have apologized and distanced themselves from nazism . 
  so has serbia . 
   serbs are doing the opposite , they cheer for the war criminals as heroes nah lol  still have ambitions to secede rs from bosnia . 
  sounds like a great idea . 
   yeah , they did n't . 
  well , 2 million bosniaks did n't die in the 90s to serbs either , problem solved , huh ? 
   but since a crime committed 100 years ago apparently makes it justified to commit crimes today never tried to justify committing crimes , but rather justify self-determination , which apparently everyone has rights to . 
   we are n't talking about wwi or wwii , we are talking about the events of the 1990s . 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen you discuss this topic without some whataboutism involving the world wars . 
  if rs ca n't exist because of 30k dead bosniak civilians , how can bosnia exist despite 2 million serbs in ww1 and ww2 ? 
  so rs can secede if they change their name then ? 
   there were more serbs in bosnia after ww2 than before it , but keep up your lies . 
  not really . 
  [ compare '61 to ' 71 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina#1961 ) . 
  even then , that 's called poorly drawn borders , ya know . 
  what are you , a genocide denier ? 
  nice . 
   this is like saying that germany as it is today is responsible for the things their ancestors have done . 
  2 hours ago you did n't seem to have any problems holding rs today responsible for what happened in the 90s ... interesting double standards . 
   vojvodina was also a part of the ndh , does this mean that serbs killed 2 million serbs ? 
  your logic is so flawed it defies reason . 
  bosniaks were n't systematically killed like serbs were , so no . 
  that was just an answer to your question if 2 million serbs died * in * bosnia . 
   serbia declared independance first declared independence how ? 
   and then began ethnic cleansing in neighboring countries which effectively turned every countries against them . 
  croatia in bosnian war ? 
  montenegro was where ? 
   because serbia committed war crimes , they lost all claims on neighboring countries in the eyes of the international community . 
  it 's quite similar to the way germany shrunk in 1945 . 
  no war crimes were committed from the sides of bosnia or croatia ? 
  interesting . 
   what on earth does bosnia have to do with that ? 
  are you telling me that 2 million serbs died in bosnia ? 
  that 's obviously bullshit . 
  ww1 bosniaks were part of and fought for austro-hungary . 
  ww2 part of ndh as muslim croats and helped massacre serbs again . 
  bosnia was a part of ndh , so yes . 
  croatia does exist . 
  what you 're telling me is that if rs changes name it has the right to self-determination ? 
  nice . 
   where the fuck did / u/neutral _ fellow say anything about kosovo ? 
  nowhere , but it 's called being consistent . 
  your argument does n't hold water and it 's as simple as that . 
  you 're being a hypocrite , 
   whataboutism my argument is shit , but if you point that out , it 's * whataboutism * . 
  screw being consistent when you can cry wolf instead . 
  every time someone points out your shit arguments you start whining about whataboutism ... really ? 
  it 's called inconsistency , 
   irelevant to the discussion ndh doesnt exist croatia does exist , actually . 
   and all of the criminals have been punished . 
  10/10 historical accuracy  let 's ignore their summers in south america   ( and arent celebrated unlike in serbia ) again , that 's some hilarious shit . 
  that 's why singers like thompson have so much attention and that 's also why president of croatia from 2000-2010 called the creation of ndh a victory for croats or how he claimed jasenovac was a work camp rather than a death camp :d, 
   do n't point out my double standard and faulty argument , it 's * whataboutism !, 
  bosniaks have everything to do with ww1 and ww2 , you obviously have n't studied your history , 
  something something , up to 2 million dead serbs in ww1 and ww2 . 
  you do n't like counting that ? 
   what a vile comment . 
  what do you mean `` hiding behind '' ? 
  srebrenica is the worst crime in europe after the holocaust . 
   32000 bosniak civilians died , and 4000 serbs did , and you want to turn this into a level playing field ? 
  why start counting from there ? 
  count the up to 2 million dead serbs in ww1 and ww2 and start talking about `` level playing field '' . 
   may i ask you why you think it 's okay to be rewarded for genocide ? 
  thank you . 
  upwards of 2 million serbs died during ww1 and ww2 , yet bosnia is independent , 
   the only reason it exists is because of removing a large group of people i.e. 
  oh yes , 800 ' 000 serbs were forcibly moved there during the 90s ... wait no , serbs have been living there for ages . 
  just like kosovo , bosnia , croatia , montenegro , macedonia , slovenia all needed support of everyone in the country ... oh wait, 
   only when it comes to ethnic political entities with historical prerogative .

  the eu has nothing to gain from helping the ukraine , specially if the east is not a part of it . 
  im just stating the obvious , nothing is happening . 
  so again , against russia , does europe stand by ukraine ? 
   putin just needs to understand that europe ( and its allies ) stands by ukraine . 
  against russia , do they though ? 
  what , really ?

  but your point is still that because the catalonian executive representatives have been removed , catalonia as an entity does simply not exist , right ? 
  so you mean that because spain killed off the aragon-king and occupied their territory , aragon/catalunia does simply not exist ? 
  in that case i guess the baltics are still soviet and norway/finland is swedish .

  ah , the `` less informed people '' aka `` everyone not agreeing with you '', 
  i 'm sorry , i do not follow , a majority of the swiss are for joining the eu , but they do not want to be in independent and therefore not be in the eu . 
  also , you think giving up your independence and becoming part of a large union gives more independence ? 
  also , the swiss people believes that it 's better to go solo . 
  this makes no sense to me , please explain . 
  so you want to be part of the eu , but not give up your independence ? 
  sounds to me like you do n't want to be in the eu then . 
  well , you probably know it better than me , but then why arent you in the eu yet ? 
  both , but originally i meant what you said . 
  its because we 're not in the euro-cult , therefore we have not fully embraced the `` eu-identity '' and are not true europeans . 
  but that second part does have some truth to it . 
  edit : also , europeans in general are not as in love with the idea of a northern socialistic paradise that naive , white , middle class americans on the internet are . 
  why ? 
  it 's not like people care about the eu-elections , they sort of just happen . 
  though , i have only voted in one , and that one was not very talked about in the media etc. 
  and this coming election , even though it is in may , i have n't even seen a poster or a proper political discussion about it in anything established . 
  the national elections are the big thing . 
  why are you guys so pro euro ? 
  it 's clearly a failed currency , half of the members are on the brink of collapse and it gives pretty much 0 benefit to the member countries . 
  it 's actually quite funny that the further away you get from the european union , the better the countries seem to run . 
  thinking mainly of norway and switzerland . 
  oh come on , stop hating on the swiss for not being in love with the socialistic united states of europe-idea . 
  sweden wont . 
  noone cares about romania, 
  danskj\u00e4vel , it means `` fucking dane '' . 
  oh ^ wait ^ this ^ was ^ not ^ r/polandball, 
  just ignore the leeching eurocrat . 
  you mean all the communist apologists ? 
  because he didnt need to , obviously . 
  good for you when you apply then , but it still wont make you a member automatically . 
  no , i did not . 
  no , catalonia is a member of spain , not the eu . 
  what other spanish agreements do you want to stay in ?

  even if it 's very likely that they did it , they 're still innocent until proven guilty ; same as everyone else . 
  battery life is still pretty shit . 
  people have been saying that it 's going to get a lot better any day now , but they 've been saying that for decades and the advances are still rather underwhelming . 
  `` stop shooting each other or we 'll shoot you '' ? 
   are you joking or what ? 
  yes . 
  but my point is that a lot of the time , both sides are doing superficially similar things . 
  since we assume that we 're right and they 're corrupt , we do it for good reasons while they do it for bad reasons . 
  and that 's probably true , but it 's not irrational of them to suspect that it might be the other way around . 
   i swear to god i 've heard the number 28 so many times it became burned into my brain . 
  which works great until the number changes and the number 28 is still burned into your brain forever . 
  either way , there 's nothing you can do with that knowledge except get points in trivia games and pub quizes . 
  from a western perspective of where the border is , sure . 
  it varies . 
  in some newspapers , the comments are more balanced and factual than the articles . 
  which might not say much . 
  considering the questions they asked , that seems perfectly reasonable . 
  knowing the number of member states is useless , and changes every couple of years anyway . 
  knowing if switzerland is a member is meaningless unless you plan to do business there . 
  knowing how the parliament is elected does n't really matter , as long as you know that you get to vote for some of them to represent you . 
  this kind of knowledge just * does n't matter * . 
  your life is completely unaffected by whether you know it or not , including things like passport and visa-free travel , because you need the passport anyway to board a plane and you did n't need any visa before the eu either . 
  that does n't help if your country was n't in the eu when you were in 5th grade . 
  the eu is still new enough that anyone over 30 remembers when it did n't exist . 
  the union has only been around for 24 years , which is n't particularly long . 
  most people simply never learned anything about the eu in school , no matter how mandatory it is today . 
  not the member states question , as that tends to change every few years . 
  it 's rather useless knowledge . 
  i also did n't learn a damn thing about the eu in third grade , as sweden had n't joined yet and it was n't seen as particularly interesting . 
  keep in mind that people above 35 are likely to not have learned ** anything ** about the eu in school , because it simply was n't taught . 
  i 'm not sure if a disagreeable referendum result is quite as notable as a battle where a million people died . 
  to be fair , any time russia has any major exercise or stations anywhere near a border , that 's seen by the west as aggression or provocations even if russia insists that it 's merely defensive . 
  so the fact that the west says that something is just defensive does n't mean it 's unreasonable for russia to read more into it . 
  they were aggressors before the sanctions . 
  hence the sanctions . 
  it probably wo n't make russia * stop * , but if disagreeable political actions come with a heavy financial cost tacked on , they 'll be much more reluctant to do so in the future . 
  the harsher the sanctions imposed , the less are the chances that we 'll see another crimea any time soon . 
  they 're far away , though . 
  it 's harder to ignore when the descendants of the survivors are still living in the country . 
   if you say `` 1 +1 = 3 '' and try to get others to believe so , it should n't be free speech . 
  that works as long as you and legislators agree . 
  it turns into a literal orwellian nightmare if you do n't . 
  the book even uses 2 +2 = 5 as an example . 
  if the government says that 2 +2 = 5 , saying otherwise is a crime , and whether or not you can prove it is irrelevant because attempting to prove that point is itself illegal . 
  that was impossible to know at the time , though . 
  the real question is n't whether it was a sensible move if you know everything we do today , but whether it was a sensible move at the time . 
  and knowing what they do know , it might well have seemed like the lesser evil even if you consider the fate of the poles . 
  they obviously failed to prevent an all-out war with germany and japan , but looking back we know that was pretty much inevitable . 
   there are examples of your prime minister and foreign minister saying sexist , racist and anti-semitic things . 
  yeah , but that goes for most countries . 
  every government has a couple of loons . 
  my point is that the really insane things that get any international media coverage are mostly non-stories about nobodies . 
  sweden both imports and exports lots of meat . 
  i do n't know the numbers , but i believe it more or less evens out . 
  some of it is mildly absurd , like importing certain beef cuts while exporting other beef cuts , as different bits have varying popularity in different countries . 
  i 'll trade you the front half of a cow for the back half of a cow !, 
  it is in sweden , where the story is from . 
  it is being cleaned , but very slowly . 
  a lot of it is so poisoned that it would be uninhabitable even if you cleaned it , unless you bulldozed the top 100 meters of soil and hauled it off to ... somewhere . 
  mainly arsenic , which does n't really decay or go away . 
  yeah , but the kebabpizza pictured is standard . 
  you can order that in pretty much every pizzeria in sweden , and people do . 
  it 's likely the most popular pizza here , for some inexplicable reason . 
  the only problems sweden has with water is having too damn much of it in the spring ( and on midsummer ) . 
  you do realize that we grow vegetables in sweden too , right ? 
  maybe not so much in the east and the north , but the south and the west is pretty much just farmland . 
  no one is saying you ca n't eat meat . 
  all they 're saying is that the free food you get in school occasionally wo n't contain any . 
  you can still bring a bag of bacon for lunch if you want . 
  yeah , but do n't eat the fake meat . 
  look at countries with stronger vegetarian traditions and make bean dishes and falafels and stuff . 
  it 's often the other way around . 
  the synthetic fertilizers contain the same stuff as the manure , minus all the carbon . 
  and the excess carbon will screw over waterways and kill all the fish by depleting all the oxygen . 
  if there 's excessive nitrogen in the water , the problem is using * too much * fertilizer , not using the wrong kind . 
  only because people believe all the `` omg ! '', 
  stories about how a swedish politician said something crazy . 
  never mentioning that the politician in question was a local politician in some municipality in the middle of nowhere whose ideas do n't have the support of anyone . 
  often pointing out that they 're a member of the second biggest party or whatever , but not mentioning that no one else in the party agrees with them . 
  but people do n't , so cutting down on it is a good idea . 
  tax haven outside of the eu , though , meaning having to out-bank the swiss at their own game . 
  without their decades long head start in treaty negotiations . 
  you expect people to still have hope ? 
  do n't expect much . 
  the tower of the cathedral is sort of neat , but that 's about it . 
  it 's been completely overrun by giants ever since don quixote died . 
  a disgrace , really . 
  no , just statistical averages . 
  the average person is of average intelligence and has an average education , and the number of times they 're more right than the majority and the number of times they 're more wrong than the majority should even out . 
  of course , everyone reading will say `` but i 'm not of average intelligence !, 
  '' , and that 's true . 
  half of you are below , though just like everyone in the world ever you 're fully convinced that you 're much smarter than almost everyone else . 
  no one is going to hold a grudge for that long . 
  i 'm sure the scots would stop caring about the english once they 'd left the union . 
  i think it might end up being better this way in the long run . 
  the eu will work much better without countries constantly threatening to leave and working against it from the inside . 
  they can always rejoin in 10-20 years or whatever . 
   except for , you know , the ones who did turn up , voted remain and got fucked regardless . 
  that 's how democracy works . 
  the majority rules .

  being from america , you would think you know freedom of expression . 
  just as other people find it comical that you think they 're bring forced to wear it in germany . 
  because germany should n't be oppressive to their citizens or residence . 
  culture is a weak argument . 
  just say for xenophobic reason . 
  it got to sting that america has marriage equality before germany, 
  it 's true but people do n't feel comfortable shafting the rural areas for urban cities . 
  plus democracy does n't allow iti, 
  why are they idiots for believing in freedom of expression ? 
  people do n't have choice in what country they were born at . 
  why should the country expect citizens to be loyally ? 
  how long are you non native if your family lived in uk for three generations, 
  easy , they are minority in germany , hence want liberalism . 
  they 're majority in turkey , hence want social conservative policy, 
  and then people question why do n't they assimilate . 
  how can you assimilate when the majority do n't accept you . 
  i do n't think german automakers and french wine would allow for embargo / s, 
  ca n't really disagree with that . 
  idk , not knowledgeable on how the law works in france, 
  how sad that france became this low, 
  since when has muslims pushed legislation or rules that hurt others ? 
  this is just bigots being bigots, 
  fair enough , sorry for jumping the gun . 
  i tried replying earlier but was notified the content got deleted . 
  seems to have a good point . 
  why you have to put pakistan on full blast , why not just say sweden . 
  a question with a question ? 
  okay , no but i 'm not russian . 
  uk has it way easier than german . 
  at least being british is n't an ethnicity so integration into britain is as easy as america or canada, 
  do you really trust your current politicians with nukes ? 
  children are n't racist or homophobe from birth . 
  their environment leads them to be . 
  i ca n't see how national indoctrination is n't the same as religion . 
  nationalism is an irrational standpoint, 
  because i did n't want to have to bear the burden of explaining why they 're bigots and antisemitic, 
  england probably because of london and them being anglophone speakers, 
  because then the international community would actually start giving shit to what happens outside their borders, 
  whether you like it or not , globalism is here to stay and the world will likely be more connected than ever before . 
  nations will cease to exist in substitute for federation, 
  what a ridiculous assumption and paranoia to the highest order . 
  you 'll fit right in with lizard people, 
  i bet most people enjoy him smacking around the top politicians as though they 're mates . 
  now , if there was someone that could do this to junker, 
  cause he 's a jew who is into multiculturalism / s, 
  it does n't make me want to ban skirts and makeup . 
  it 's indoctrination to the highest order for kids who did n't developed mentally, 
  you do n't know social structure forces women to be feminine like school uniforms and workplaces ? 
  switch hijab to skirt and see how ridiculous your statement seems, 
  it 's hard not to see the similarities . 
  anyone with half of brain would be uncomfortable with the image, 
  they 're not mutually exclusive, 
  because refusing to allow people of certain geographic to come is a form of discrimination , which is looked down upon by western civilization . 
  because eu countries respect human rights and freedom of religion, 
  she 's an epitome of pragmatism . 
  killing her dog wo n't shake her goals . 
  such a low effort to compare with saudi arabia . 
  eu countries should compare with those that respect human rights value, 
  merkel and obama have better relationship than cameron, 
  honestly it 's because the population is n't social conservative . 
  the party aligns with the public views, 
  canada is a country of immigrants , the cities belong to all canadians not just white, 
  my uncle must be ecstatic and fuming with national pride . 
  i 'm never going to hear the end of it, 
  i wonder what used to be the big topics before the migrant crisis, 
  atlanta hip hop scene is really thriving . 
  the dab came from there . 
  it 's logistically impossible without breaking eu rules, 
  in europe with an american flair ? 
  yes it 's too much to ask, 
  unfortunately i 'm still in college and have n't gotten into the job market yet . 
  being in the eu and having a lot of opportunities to work in other countries must be a plus but idk if you want to leave croatia . 
  i 'm sorry i ca n't give you a good advice because i 'm not experienced, 
  because it 's a regressive outlook, 
  bro , that is definitely a crazy amount to feel grateful of in a developed country . 
  people get that much in a week . 
  surely that ca n't be right , only 500 ? 
  is it a blue collar job or are there skills needed for it, 
  sweden changed from the savagery of the vikings to now . 
  it really puts time into perspective, 
  rip ... just like jesus , we 'll remember you for your sacrifice . 
  what led you to think that ? 
  do you personally experienced or have facts disputing it ? 
  who 's their candidates ? 
  that wolfe guy blundered so bad , it showed the incompetence of ukip, 
  do n't worry , it was n't only eastern european immigrants they were against . 
  they are staying awfully long there, 
  people do n't want to see themselves as xenophobes and be oppressive, 
  how do such simpleton up vote this crap ? 
  people do n't even know what they 're arguing about, 
  would it be wrong for me to hope in some kind of twisted way that trump wins just to see the meltdown, 
  compared to what other countries have for their head of state in europe , merkel is jesus, 
  i respected her criticism of saudi arabia and the palestinian issue , but this really is baffling . 
  except for mena and south africa , i do n't think africa is more racist than white countries, 
  i thought she was better than this . 
  i do n't mind getting raped if it was from an attractive biologically women, 
  the opposite is letting turkey succumb to russia 's influence and middle eastern theocracy . 
  it would benefit europe tremendously if turkey progressed to eu standard . 
  same for eastern europe . 
  care to refute their opinion or ...

  later , everything west of constantinople was basically called europe , and everything east , asia . 
  if turkey is in europe , then great britain is a south american country . 
  haha , i just pictured someone watching this wonderful video while sitting in a cubicle , and pondering how he or she never saw half of these places or did those fun activities . 
  in the window , the view outside is a rainy parking lot . 
  gypsies , pollacks , rich people , women , alcoholics , nerds ... the list goes on . 
  everybody belongs to some group . 
  if you 're one of them , nobody cares if you get your face smashed in . 
  but if you 're some sort of special protected group , any harm done to you will be considered a political movement against every member of your group . 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  a jew gets beaten and suddenly their community fears a great societal anti-semitic movement . 
  geez , do n't panic . 
  people from other ethnic groups get beaten up without the whole country caring . 
  yeah , it 's a great example of manipulation by the media . 
  if there is no evidence for the attackers being arabs , let 's get some witness to say some vague testimony . 
   i did n't really see it that well because i did n't bring my glasses , but i thiiiiiink it might be them arabs . 
  newsflash : arabs thought to be behind a brutal assault on a jew . 
  i suspect anyone who devotes his or her life to spreading religion must be some kind of nutjob . 
  eu 's bureaucracy is simply put - byzantine . 
  if we want to have any sort of federal europe , it should be simple and close to the people . 
  right now , most eu citizens have not the slightest clue how this whole circus is functioning . 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  i certainly do n't like centralization : companies are getting bigger and bigger , nations are merging . 
  there is less and less diversity . 
  we 're all watching the same tv shows , we 're thinking in similar patterns . 
  for instance , i would like to see scotland have its independence just to see something new on the old european playing field . 
  i do n't want europe to become another usa , seeing america 's flaws . 
  i do n't want europe to become uniform , so there is always a place for everyone . 
  sure , it 's a utopian fairytale , but having an unattainable ideal at least pushes you in some direction . 
  a eu with a trade union , with freedom of passage between borders , with many wonderful projects such as the erasmus exchange - that 's something we can not deny worked for the benefit of europe . 
  but let 's not give the eu a president , please . 
  local governments are the ones that are the most honest and accountable . 
  as we go higher and higher , we get corruption , lobbying , and debauchery . 
  the way i see it , the vatican might at some point become a hostage of italy - does n't italy provide most of vatican 's budget ? 
  let 's just wait and watch , it 's going to happen within a generation or two . 
  these are the 3 most popular and the most deserving , in my opinion . 
  and the soviet anthem is just so good they kept it after the collapse . 
  sure , now they sing about their colorful flag , but everybody 's singing the old lyrics in their heads , i bet . 
  yeah , you might be right , it will go underground . 
  but on the other hand i expect that there will be proper , wise child care laws . 
  let 's say a religious parent illegally and dangerously circumcised his or her child . 
  after a few years , the kid goes to the doctor for a general check-up . 
  the doctor checks everything and notices that the kid was mutilated . 
  now , according to child protection laws , he calls the proper authorities and the parent is in deep trouble . 
  alternatively , if a parent tries to circumcise a child and something goes wrong , they will have to call emergency . 
  they will save the kid and then the parent will be in deep trouble . 
  exactly . 
  being poor in a post-communist country is completely different than being poor in , say , germany or france . 
  while being poor in germany means you wo n't be buying a new iphone or a car , being poor in the east means you 're going to have to go through people 's garbage in search of clothes for winter . 
  why all the downvotes ? 
  look - if you 're so fond of your scientific way of thinking , then go do your own research . 
  you dismiss those `` so-called scientists '' , but that 's how ichthyology works . 
  nothing idiotic about that kind of experiment . 
  being skeptic does not boil down to rejecting every opinion other than yours . 
  if you understand evolution a little more than what you see from cartoons , then you 'll be inclined to accept the idea that some pattens propagate from simple organisms to the oh-so-proud mighty and complex human beings . 
  yes , our society is similar to groups of other kinds of animals . 
  to put it in layman 's terms : in times of danger , societies unify . 
  he who is different from others will be branded . 
  this is basic tribal thinking , present in today 's society despite our hubris . 
  if there is a war between tribes , and your skin color is strange , or you do n't dress up in your traditional colors , you look like a spy from the other village . 
  tribes have treated this extremely seriously for ages . 
  to fit in the group you had to mutilate your own body . 
  if your self-expression is incompatible with the accepted norm , some people will want to kill you . 
  what happened in america after 9/11 ? 
  every muslim was immediately suspected of terrorism . 
  suddenly the entire usa behaves like a tribe . 
  compare a no-stress kindergarten to the military . 
  children will be brought up to be individualistic and non-conformist . 
  in the military , not so much . 
  you can not be gay in the military . 
  you have to shave your head . 
  everyone should stand in line . 
  if you 're different , others will gang up on you . 
  that 's how society works . 
  you can try to sell me your politically correct slogans but i 'm not buying them . 
  conservatives are always on about preserving traditions and pointing at those who are in any way different - be it sexual orientation , skin color , origin , religion , clothes . 
  self-preservation is about working in the interest of the group . 
  self-expression is only about the individual . 
  if the group sees you as a potential danger , you will be excluded . 
  that 's why i try to say that conservatism , nationalism try to unify people under the slogans of the preservation of society/tradition . 
  trade unions want to preserve the rights of workers . 
  look at solidarity - it was unanimous against their oppressor , the government . 
  after they won , the group disbanded and started a war between its factions . 
  i think the pattern is pretty clear . 
  it 's not a false dichotomy , as it can be observed in nature . 
  i ca n't find you a source now , but there were studies on fish about this . 
  scientists observed a species of fish that can easily ( within a generation ) produce offspring of different scale colors and patterns . 
  when there was a threat present ( predators , decreased amount of food ) , the fish tended to be all the same . 
  there was a low number of individual fish different from the average , so the deviation of appearances was lower . 
  with a prolonged absence of threats , newborn fish started to exhibit individual traits , scale color patterns etc. 
  this may be a very simple experiment but it does illustrate a principle rule in evolution : there is place for diversity when there is less danger . 
  times of strife are a test for this diversity . 
  diversity needs to be there before there is danger , in order to increase chances of survival . 
  unifying around the most successful combination of traits is a way for a population to survive . 
  i might not persuade you that it made sense to substitute `` unity '' with `` survival '' . 
  but if you would like to know where i took those ideas from , i highly recommend reading books written by ian stewart and jack cohen , a team of a mathematician and biologist . 
  maths and biology are sort of polar opposites . 
  together , they take a very unusual perspective on life in general . 
  the book they wrote most relevant to this question might be `` the collapse of chaos '' . 
  otherwise you might want to search for other general texts about evolution , behavior of populations in presence of danger , that sort of keywords . 
  hope that shed some light .

  it goes under `` international '' . 
  our two most popular news papers/tabloids are metro and aftonbladet , both are shit . 
  then we have two largest liberal news papers svd & dn , which both are actually rather good at covering european news - although it goes under the international headlines . 
  we also do have a very good supply of foreign news papers in our libraries . 
  [ relevant scale for assessment ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_european_framework_of_reference_for_languages ), 
  it looses all meaning if translated . 
  it 's not easy ( latvian ) being estonian . 
  but it 's cool ( baltic ) . 
  so , without parenthesis ; it 's not latvian being estonian , but it 's baltic . 
  i know a great swedish joke about estonia ; det \u00e4r inte lett att vara est , men det \u00e4r balt !, 
  but there was a previous opening a couple of years back ? 
  was n't there ? 
  edit : i was thinking about [ this opening ( article in swedish ) ] ( http://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/krigets-fasor-fram-i-ljuset-i-finland ? ), 
  did n't know . 
  i actually just assumed they were armenian because of his fascination for armenia . 
  the more you know !, 
  never met an armenian , but i know lord byron moved there and looked [ fabulous ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nugcteh.jpg ) in traditional armenian garments . 
  cool photographs that i have n't seen before . 
  a few years back ( 2008 i think ? ), 
  the finnish government released a lot of previously unpublished war photographs of very graphic nature . 
  they showcased things like cannibalism amongst the poor russian souls caught in the finnish motti 's . 
  i do really like the reindeer packed with supplies . 
  i know reindeers were used by norwegian sami 's to smuggle supplies past nazi checkpoints in norway for the allies . 
  not really similar to the british riots . 
  it 's very isolated and unorganized . 
  we had big riots in gothenburg against the `` war on terrorism '' , those were massive and got way out of hand . 
  these current riots are much smaller but they seem to have way more destruction of property in it 's wake . 
  it 's more like extreme vandalism than riots or protests . 
  they have a finance minister ? 
  one of swedens greatest song writers is dutch . 
   a american man finds his wife in bed with her lover , he grabs his gun and shoots the other man . 
   a saudi man finds his wife in bed with her lover , he grabs his wife and takes her out to the town square and stones her . 
   a swedish man finds his wife in bed with her lover and asks `` what did i do wrong ? '', 
  this is a joke i 've heard a couple of times meaning to show what a bunch of sissies we are . 
  but really , which solution is the least stupid ? 
  buying sex is illegal , selling sex is legal . 
  oh was it one of those municipal youth jobs ? 
  for like 15-16 year olds ? 
  50 sek / h ? 
  what on earth did you work with and how old were you ? 
  but that 's kind of the point , there is no regulated minimum pay . 
  however most people are members of a union and they collaboratively bargain their salaries . 
  sweden 's old emergency number was 90 000 , so stupid . 
  oh lappland is a official geographical area in both sweden and norway , it 's just that what 's outlined on the map seems to be a cultural area that ought to be closer to `` sapmi '' which is an unofficial geographical area - but the cultural area of the sami people . 
  so today i would n't say that `` lapp '' is un-pc , it just refers to people in the lappland area , rather than the sami people . 
  should n't `` lapps '' be [ sapmi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%a1pmi_ ( area ) ), 
  the term `` curling parent '' comes from the sport of curling referring to the aspect of the sport that is brushing the ice in front of the stone to reduce friction . 
  in america the concept is usually called `` helicopter parent '' as the parent is always hovering overhead . 
  blue banana . 
  oh c'mon - this submission seems to just bait for attention and drama . . 
  it 's from a comedy show where he proclaims a bunch of things about germany and the other contestants has to guess whether it 's true or false . 
  they say that it 's true that germans have a higher iq and also give a source . 
  i must have clicked somewhere wrong , what i watched was a speech with [ this guy ] ( http://youtu.be/_rmzmxbzc8w?t=50s ) . 
  but wasnt this clip , he speaks quite clearly here . 
  the one i originally watched it was almost difficult to comprehend . 
  what a guy to stand up in the ep with that stutter !, 
  but ... god how difficult to listen to . 
  edit : i must have clicked somewhere on youtube , what i watched was a speech with [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/_rmzmxbzc8w?t=50s ) guy . 
  kista galleria is open until 2100 all days of the week . 
  regarding your flag flair , why does it say `` oink '' rather than `` portugal '' ? 
  what is a real libertarian ? 
  i 've heard a lot of different definitions of the concept - all claiming to be `` real libertarian '' . 
  so , what do you believe ? 
  what are your ideals ? 
  is n't it ? 
   in sweden we had a butcher who , with state regulated calculations of meat content , had to write down that his sausages had a meat content of 116 % in his sausages . 
  brought up some confusion , but was all according to law . 
  oh the embarrassment . 
  i 'll redact my bolded comment and leave it there for context . . 
  really ? 
  the banana ? 
  come on !, 
  oldest myth in the book . 
  a lie brought up by eurosceptic british media that spread all over europe . 
  the whole law was basically just copied from regulation that already existed in most of these countries through different trade organizations in to the official eu law . 
  and the very strict regulations of size on bananas was only for the `` extra class '' bananas , not the usual class ' that most stores have and sell .

  i read a bit further and apparently they managed to make an exception for pizza to count the 1/8 cup of tomato sauce as 1/2 cup of tomato sauce - which makes it a vegetable . 
  now im trying to find how many cups of tomato sauce warrants a vegetable by european standards .

  i only have two friends in the military , neither will probably tell you that they are military the first time you meet them . 
  they do n't want to be judged .

  im being spammed with downvotes , on every comment .

  im so surprised . 
  the spamming of downvotes really proves how correct this was :  the angry reaction people in here have shows they misunderstand . 
  you should have listened to what she actually says . 
  but it seem in this thread its all about straw men . 
  no wonder the anti-refugee people are difficult to take seriously .

  this really is n't proof , you know . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lkvln/sweden_vs_denmark_debate_refugees_so_close_but_so/cv7pcot this is still from the original thread . 
  is there a reason you refuse to admit it ? 
   `` just because dkk in denmark and fn in france have gained popularity , does n't mean sd in sweden will too '' is not the same thing as  you even say sd will never gain popularity . 
  right ? 
  its very simple . 
  im getting downvotes for political reasons . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lkvln/sweden_vs_denmark_debate_refugees_so_close_but_so/cv98gpd?context=3 this is the same comment . 
  i deleted it and repeated it , because they spammed it with donvotes . 
   basically in every thread about sweden you show up , say your famous `` everybody on reddit is delusional about sweden , no information here '' ( i 'm paraphrasing ) , and usually call someone racist -- oftentimes me . 
   i use this alt to call out racist bullshit , because they are often rabid enough to follow you to other subs , and open the comment history and downvote everything you say . 
  no good if im making comments in a serious sub , and even that is downvotes for no reason , other then the racists are upset . 
  if this sub was not so obsessed with lying about sweden , for the racst agendas sake , then we would not have to call them out on it . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lkvln/sweden_vs_denmark_debate_refugees_so_close_but_so/cv7p07i another exampel .

  that is fanatical . 
  people here dont care who is right . 
  they just want to silence those that dont fall in line . 
  yes . 
  why would he not ? 
  he knwos what he is talking about and makes very good points . 
  / europe is going to hate him yes , but that is a compliment by now . 
   since they seem to still have some connection to reality !, 
  why is it that everyone that `` gives it to denmark '' seem to be this childish ? 
  the entire thread all the same . 
  this is why right wing populism is so manipulative . 
  it demands that you accept their world view and sensationalism , against experience and knowledge . 
   ( `` migrants will adapt , they will benefit us at one point '' ) . 
  yes , we have gone though this before . 
  and they will adapt , they always do . 
   `` just because dkk in denmark and fn in france have gained popularity , does n't mean sd in sweden will too '' which is 100 % true . 
  thanks for all the donwvotes . 
  i reapeat : name me one alternative media that is not right wing extreme propaganda . 
  anyone ? 
  or just downvotes to hide behind again ? 
  edit its been 14 hours since i posted this question the first time . 
  i have gotten 40 downvotes on it before asking again this time . 
  thank you for proving my point / europe . 
  swedish politicians wont accept populism or sensationalism . 
  so were where the swedish raggare when sweden took in 80.000 finnish refugees in 1944 ? 
  luckily our politicians are sane enough so they dont get their worldview from racists and extremists on / europe and / european . 
  the delusions of this sub is getting creepier by the day . 
  its a bubble of misinformation and propaganda , and you all eat it up . 
   european continent are you seriously confusing the european continent with r/europe ? 
  you can not possibly be that dumb ? 
   if you insist on being disingenuous some people will keep downvoting you . 
  that is not why im getting donwvotes . 
  the racist are downvoting anyone not as dishonest as you . 
  in fact , its proving my point . 
  everyone can see that you lie , but still downvote me . 
  no one is that dishonest and rabid for no reason . 
  and we know a lot of these myths and rhetoric started on white power circles , so why copy them ? 
  i dont think i need to distance myself from something i have not said . 
  your straw men are not my responsibility . 
   most of the swedish speakers in that debate sounded positively dictatorial , wanting to do away with the side of the discussion that disagreed with them , emotionally blackmailing their opponents , and basically dismissing the concerns of a good many voters . 
  see this is why its impossible to deal with right wing populists or racists . 
  you see what you want to see . 
  none of that happened in that video . 
   he basically calls most of the european continent racist . 
  you did this to get the racists to keep spamming downvotes , i dont care if you do it personally , but you lie about me to get me even more downvoted and hidden away . 
   but i understand if they hate us because of our politicians . 
  if they hate us because our politicians are not sensationalists or populists then let them .

  what could happen though , with a left minority government , is that the right side still present a common budget , and sd chosing to support that one rather than presenting their own . 
  that would mean that the left side would have to enact the rights budget suggestion . . 
  i really hope it only means that she means that eu wo n't object to ukraine willingly belonging to the eurasian union while still have a trade deal with eu . 
  however , i ca n't help but feel it 's like a women 's shelter sending a woman back to her abusive man , because it gives russia more reason to try to push ukraine towards it . 
  monkeys ? 
  really ? 
  fair enough !, 
  just shows my ignorance , but that white area was so tempting a target for it . 
  so am i !, 
  you can really play `` spot chernobyl in ukraine '' on that map . 
  my personal take on the reason for him saying that is that he put the opposition in a tough spot . 
  either they have to campaign on a no reform platform , invent money ( or overspend ) and seem financially unreliable or cut costs associated with immigration and expose them for the risk of being seen as racists . 
  but that 's just my uninformed take on it . 
  there was another poll that was reported a few days ago ( [ link in swedish ] ( http://www.dn.se/valet-2014/majoritet-for-att-ta-emot-flyktingar/ ) ) 26 % think sweden should accept more refugees , 36 % think the level should be the same , 32 % would like to decrease the amount and 6 % said `` do n't know '' . 
  in an election where 3758951 voters voted for 20 seats in the parlament , meaning that each seat takes about 5 % of the votes , or 188000 votes . 
  just to keep the perspective . 
  that 's how you get invaded . 
  ah , no , the swedish state radio has a program each summer where different more or less famous people get 1 show each where they tell their story and play some music . 
  i did not listen though , so i do n't know what he was talking about . 
  few swedes have heard of gustav trolle , but everyone learns about kristian tyrann and stockholms bloodbath ( and sometimes they get told ( incorrectly ) that he 's nicknamed kristian den gode in denmark ) . 
  left-wingers does n't like mannerheim ? 
  how come ? 
  swedish wikipedia had no information about any controversy and i thought he was considered like the greatest finnish person of all times ? 
  [ josef fritzl ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fritzl_case ), 
  i like your thinking !, 
  luckily he is n't known by many above the age of 30 ( well , unless they listened to him on radio this summer ), 
  so did israel . 
  is n't that because of the investor protection parts though ? 
  as far as i know , there does n't exist anything like that between membership countries in the union ? 
  well , he did kill off most of his opposition in [ stockholms blodbad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stockholm_bloodbath ) and he was king of sweden for awhile , so i think he counts . 
  nah , he 's more of a footnote in swedish history . 
  he was king on paper for awhile , but not in reality . 
  and after his failed war he was deposed . 
  to be honest i do n't think _ that _ many swedes know we shared king with poland for a few years . 
  i have a hard time coming up with anyone for sweden really . 
  the closest i can think of is a danish king called [ christian ii of denmark ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_ii_of_denmark ) ( or as we call him kristian tyrann ( christan the tyrant ) . 
  but that 's so long ago that we do n't really hold the danes directly responsible anymore . . 
  fair enough !, 
  i just recall reading those amas a few months ago , and i liked them so much and i just remembered that tidbit about him and dyson . 
  but the reddit legendar / u/touchmyfuckingcoffee ( who basically is the reddit go to guy when it comes to vacuum cleaners says that dysons are n't as good as other brands .

   in his speech at the 1974 nobel prize banquet friedrich hayek stated that had he been consulted on the establishment of a nobel prize in economics , he would `` have decidedly advised against it '' [ 24 ] [ 28 ] primarily because `` the nobel prize confers on an individual an authority which in economics no man ought to possess ... 
  this does not matter in the natural sciences . 
  here the influence exercised by an individual is chiefly an influence on his fellow experts ; and they will soon cut him down to size if he exceeds his competence . 
  but the influence of the economist that mainly matters is an influence over laymen : politicians , journalists , civil servants and the public generally . '', 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nobel_memorial_prize_in_economic_sciences ) . 
  i think it 's an interesting quote that deserves some thought . 
  it 's not the nobel price in economics . 
  it 's [ the sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nobel_memorial_prize_in_economic_sciences ) . 
  saying otherwise gives it more gravitas than it should perhaps have . 
  would n't it be better to set up a temporary tribunal like was done in haag after the jugoslav war ? 
  or is the keyword here suspect so that would not be possible ? 
  i wish they would have shown more eu cities , because of the ones named , london was only behind vienna , paris and budapest , while it had prague slightly behind london and athens and sofia quite far behind . 
  the reason for political refugees from sweden is because we have compulsory education and that you are not allowed to home school your own kids as you see fit . 
  so there are a few cases of people that can not accept this and thus move country . 
  ( then we have people moving to other countries for other reasons as well , but not as refugees ) . 
  apart from iceland , i also suspect norway could get fast tracked if they had had any wish at all to join . 
  also i suspect that a independant scotland would be a member before 2020 as well . 
  but of other states i see no realistic candidates . 
  getting drunk for ukraine . 
  hm , i like the sound of it . 
  can we apply for eu sponsoring , something something culture event ? 
  the german hostage i suppose in this case . 
  will this cause eu to back down or will we stand firm in the face of the bully ? 
  out of curiosity , these same links that you spam ( in different threads according to your posting history ) how do they relate to the topic at hand ? 
  care to actually share your thoughts on it ? 
  i do n't see the relevance of the drought in western usa to the problems facing the polish logisitics companies , but then , i 've always been a bit thick . 
  i think we need to be a group of people doing that , those shipping costs looked a bit excessive for one person to go all in and buy a few beers . 
  sadly it only seems that systembolaget in sweden sells different kinds of ukrainian vodkas . 
  ah , see , this is where your knowledge of the english language has you at a disadvantage then !, 
   because to me ( i was going to write us , but i 'm not going to pretend to speak for someone else ) it 's more like `` it 's better to cause a little discomfort to ourselves rather than having someone else cause massive discomfort to us '' so to me ( thanks to my ignorance ) it was a witty comeback . 
  and getting shot in the head is referring to oneself 's position in relation to russia if one did n't take action against them . 
  so to me ( with limited knowledge of english ) it made complete sense . 
  this would be so amazing . 
  [ almedalen week ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/almedalen_week ), 
  i was going to complain that i did n't see any sex , then i clicked the second link . 
  i could see the roof of my house !, 
  do they have an internal competition in russia who can come up with the silliest reason as to ban products or something ? 
  was that one of his polish tweets ? 
  because none in english claimed that . 
  the closest was his retweet that said :  got to check out more convoy trucks this morning . 
   one closed trucks was opened for press . 
  this is n't [ / r/danmag ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/danmag/ ), 
  because it had nothing at all to do with a broader definition of rape ( going into effect around the time you mention ) , counting each instance of rape as 1 case ( even though it can be a person reporting being raped every day for a year = 365 cases ) and in general a high tendancy to report the crime here compared to other parts of the world . 
  what an unpleasant man . 
  yeah , i read the entire thing before i noticed that . 
   danske bank is the part of the danske bank group , the largest bank in europe and one of the leading financial organizations in europe .

  `` a trillion here , a trillion there , pretty soon , you 're talking real money . '', 
  [ misattributed reference ] ( http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/everett_dirksen ), 
   an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization . 
  i think you 'll find it somewhat hard to argue sweden fitting that description . 
  in sweden , anabolic -- androgenic steroids are illegal to buy , own , make , sell , give or bring into the country .

  this is n't the 1950s anymore where we needed finnish immigrants for our workforce . 
  sweden has at least 8 % unemployed rate , and this only includes people over 25 , those not going to school , and who are written as unemployed . 
  over 25 % of people under 25 in sweden are jobless . 
  most of our `` better '' immigrants are in school in sfi ( swedish classes ) . 
  and a good chunk of people are n't written as unemployed because they get support from their family instead . 
  this all makes a lot different statistic number . 
  sweden 's workforce does not need more people !, 
  it needs more actual jobs ; there is already a huge supply of educated potential workers . 
  wage dumping is all that will happen with taking in more workers , and it already happens way too much . 
  tl ; dr : most immigrants the us lets in are those who have money or already have a job set up . 
  yep . 
   give them greater control over it how does the eu have more control over the flow of refugees without the dublin rules ? 
   more immigrants that 's not what i said though  usa has only double the amount of refugees that sweden has ( in an outdated statistic ) , yet its land is over 8 times larger . 
   if syrians do come to the united states now how are they going to do that , exactly ? 
  they wo n't be able to get in the planes to get over there due to controls , unless they go through illegal methods and pay a lot for it . 
  all i was wondering is why the us government does n't seem to want to share any of the asylum burden . 
  they have a military presence already in syria , lots of airplanes and cargo ships going back and forth ... surely it would n't be too hard to take a couple thousand back with them every once in a while and give them `` the american dream '' ? 
  according to `` the economist '' , * increasing * wage dumping and increasing the burden on social welfare services is a positive thing to a country 's economy . 
  boy have i been wrong !, 
  not attacking you , but why does n't america take more refugees anyways ? 
  after all , usa is `` the big melting pot '' , innit ? 
  also a lot more open land etc for them to go to .

   i was not able to watch movies while traveling what do you mean ? 
  i could play netflix fine with traveling , as long as i did n't have vpn turned on . 
  only thing lacking was some stuff that did n't exist in my traveling region ; is that what you mean ? 
   i remember daredevil was delayed this is most likely because they had trouble getting subtitles made in time . 
  especially since they release the entire season at once : / swedish subs are usually made quickly so there is n't usually too much of a delay , but i know this happens to finnish netflix sometimes . 
  for some reason they require localized subtitles to be made before putting it out in those regions , so it 's a bit unfortunate to us who are fine with english . 
  her solution to lack of integration in sweden is to continue to increase the amount of newcomers we get . 
  because obviously the system is n't overloaded , so throwing all these people into slums that contain very few swedish people will totally make integration happen . 
  she can keep backpedaling all she wants , she is an awful person and hopefully no one eats it up . 
   negativ h\u00e4ndelse som intr\u00e4ffar * utan avsikt * fr\u00e5n de inblandade a plane crashing because of ( for example ) bad weather conditions is an olycka . 
  a plane crashing because someone broke into the cockpit and removed the pilot is not an olycka . 
  so i think she fully understood that olycka ca n't be used for an intentional act . 
  she says such stupid shit all the time ; there is no way it 's not part of her plan . 
  a native swedish speaker , such as \u00c5sa romson , would never use olycka as anything other than something that is purely accidental . 
  an olycka is * never * something that has intent in it . 
  so she knew damn well what she said . 
  but are n't those who enter [ fas 3 ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/fas_3 ) not considered as unemployed by scb ? 
  and those who go back to school when they ca n't find work -- even though they already have high qualifications -- also not counted in scb 's aku statistics ? 
   disgracing `` a foreign nation or a foreign state , its superior official , head of state , flag or other recognized symbol of nationality , the flag of the united nations or the flag of the council of europe '' is a criminal offence under art . 
  95 of the criminal code . 
  the punishment is a fine or imprisonment for up to two years . 
  in the case of a `` gross offence '' , the punishment may be imprisonment for up to six years . 
  the same punishments apply to disgracing , insulting or uttering defamatory insinuations about `` other employees of a foreign state present in [ iceland ] '' . 
  if you want to make an example of a country that is a bit more plaintiff-friendly in defamation suits , you 'd want to try usa . 
  but this wo n't work anyways , he would n't get asylum for this . 
  all we can hope for is the courts work it out and rule in b\u00f6hmermann 's favor and remove the law . 
  if not , maybe he just pay a small fine to appease some people . 
  there are many high-up germans who want b\u00f6hmermann prosecuted , particularly those who have not been happy with his previous acts . 
  most of those people who claim the prosecution is to respect erdogan 's honor is n't giving their full feelings on the matter . 
  the uk ? 
  even after the 2013 defamation act was passed , libel suits in the uk are generally not very plaintiff-friendly . 
  i imagine if b\u00f6hmermann was trialed in the uk , he would not win . 
  sounds weird that someone would think their neighbors would care less about your nation 's security than another country half way around the world ... but if you consider that the usa has just 5 % of the world 's population -- yet around 50 % of the world 's military expenditure , and adding onto how `` world police '' they are , i guess it 's not too unrealistic for people to see the us as the biggest ally . 
  how does my name check out ? 
  it was a policy change in 2011 to give permanent residence permits to syrians instead of the normal temporary permits . 
  previously , the policy was generally to only give temporary permits and have them be renewed after 2 years . 
  but because migrationsverket are lazy and has said that `` the situation does not seem likely to improve in the near-future '' , they changed the policy . 
  ich will has still been censored ? 
  i thought they just did n't air the music video when it was supposed to be due to the attacks . 
  kinda sad if so , it honestly has a good message . 
  did she apply and get a ut-kort as your sambo , or is she here as an eu citizen ? 
  if she got an ut-kort , she should make sure she is written as arbetsf\u00f6rmedlingen . 
  if she is also under 25 , and has been written there and searching work for the past 3 months , she will be allowed into `` jobbgaranti f\u00f6r ungdomar '' program and get around 3000 a month from f\u00f6rsakringskassan . 
  if she is over 25 i think there is another program , but need to wait more months to be let into it iirc . 
  not a super lyx thing but could help with a bit of money if it 's an issue at all . 
  eh , bostadsbidrag is still pretty generous . 
  sure you are n't going to get a place on norrmalmstorg with it , but there are still decent places . 
  ( of course this is considering you can find available housing in the first place ... ), 
  it depends . 
  originally they were supposed to be just temporary residence permits , which is for 2 years . 
  then when they renew , there is a chance it will become perm . 
  once they have that , it 's pretty difficult to make them leave . 
  one big fuck-up that sweden has made now in the past 5 years is from laziness : by default , anyone claiming to be a refugee from syria is given a permanent residence permit , not the normal 2 year temporary permit . 
  so these people will probably never leave , other than on their own decision ... which i ca n't say i am too expecting of . 
  well , adultery is/was criminalized during the years clinton was in office ... so technically what he supposedly did was n't fully legal , but i think most people do n't get charged for it unless it 's in a divorce court . 
  so basically you want to be prescribed marijuana for your ptsd ? 
  sorry then , i do n't know much about that ; have you asked those people who were successful from uk/scandinavia ? 
  i just am not too sure how one would be able to arrange it ... even if one were prescribed marijuana in the netherlands , would a pharmacy in their home-country dispense it -- much less even have it in stock ? 
  but i wish you luck , hopefully you find a solution . 
  what is your illness and current country of residence ? 
  [ ehic ] ( http://www.imtj.com/news/european-health-insurance-card-ehic-not-medical-tourists/ ) is not intended to be used in the way it sounds like you are describing . 
  the formal way to go about doing would be to become a resident in the other country , with plans to stay there for a long amount of time after your treatment is handled ( aka pay back in taxes etc ) . 
  otherwise , you are doing medical tourism which is not the intention of ehic and is generally not very nice to the country you are visiting . 
  unless you 're describing just getting medicine prescribed ? 
  the way you explain it without much backstory makes it hard for me to understand if you are needing some special operation ( `` illness not treated well '' ) , or if there is some drug you need prescribed that is not allowed in your country ? 
  so please give more backstory if i did n't explain good enough , 
  yeah , and i assume it 's the same in spain as it is in sweden ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urgcz15cdga still awful what they did , no one should be attacked , but the beggars are typically not refugees . 
  i use chrome if i am watching netflix , the subtitles are really big though . 
  just another reason why sometimes it just becomes nicer to open the file in vlc/etc instead . 
  if i have to do anything bypass netflix 's geographic restrictions , for me the easiest solution is to find a 1080p bluray rip/web-dl of the content with english subtitles built in . 
  ( ignoring really obscure or old stuff , of course ) have n't tested any alternatives in sweden sadly ; if i want to watch some tv series it 's usually on svtplay/tv4play/some other official site . 
  even in that case i usually end up using svtplay-dl and playing it through vlc ... maybe i am weird , but it always feels best to simply have video files if possible . 
  i do n't typically try to avoid giving the publishers money ... but if i need to go through hoops to get something to play in good quality and have flexible settings , the more straightforward decision is that with no drm/etc . 
   the rapes were n't reported until several days after ah yeah , there 's the kicker . 
  if only they went into the hospital for one quicker , they could have hopefully gotten a trace then . 
  none of those who were assaulted ( in ways other than `` just '' groping ) had any kind of rape kit taken ?

too bad our military has been severely mismanaged and underfunded for the last decade or two but i would much prefer we get our collective heads out our arses and explore a defence alliance with you guys before even considering nato though . 
  sell the medal . 
   what evaluation process is so perfect that calling it flawed is not a reasonable opinion ? 
  if any given evaluation process can be considered flawed then calling an evaluation process flawed adds no information whatsoever . 
  of course not . 
  it was meant as a snide comment to point out that that band of murderers do n't hold any legitimacy whatsoever . 
  anything we do to inhibit their rampage will by them be seen as an affront and of course be propagandised against us but that ca n't be a reason to not act with respect to the movement of fighters to and from europe . 
  still much nicer colours than theirs . 
  ` they ' as in the women i guess . 
  every time i can identify a word being spoken by a danish person i learn danish . 
  i have n't learned much danish yet :(, 
  population . 
  damn it , my plan was moving to denmark . 
  so let 's throw a party in solidarity of our ukrainian friends ? 
  we really fucked that one up . 
  even better for gaza !, 
  consumer rights have always been strong in scandinavia . 
  well the question you 've so far failed to answer is ; how can i trust my representatives if i do n't know what they 're doing , how can can i hold them accountable for their actions ? 
  well they got whipped with birch twigs when they sat in the sauna . 
  that 's when they realised finland is just like saudi arabia but colder . 
  this is interesting . 
  would you like to share the source ? 
  practice makes perfect . 
  i 'm not informed on the matter as to what would be the most suitable solution so i voted united benelux because i do n't like too many colours , also makes geography easier . 
  also , what the fuck is up with the baltic sea ? 
  now imagine the hassle if we 'd have border control . 
  syrians get permanent residence automatically . 
  is there an echo in here ? 
  you mean they ca n't even vote left . 
  first one . 
  the rest of europe knows about arnstad ? 
  now i 'm sad . 
  batt it iss an `` s '' vuitt an appsajd daun tjajnees hat !, 
   also , anti-racism and anti-discrimination ideas are very entrenched in swedish psyche and feels nice , as a foreigner , to know that they 're actively ** fighting the urge to hurt ** you . 
  ftfy, 
  my father was actually working on the gripen project in the late 80 's . 
  he was responsible for the wings and the nose of the aircraft and in connection to a crash my grandfather called him asking what the hell they were doing . 
  father responded by noting that the wings were still intact . 
  it must have been the crash in 89 because he was ill with leukaemia in 93 . 
  rest in peace father . 
  sure , that 's why you do n't start off with lets unite norden . 
  that would be like asking a girl if you can cum on her face before even having a first date . 
  what you do instead is talk about closer cooperation in areas where it makes a lot of sense . 
  for example in areas such as higher education , r&d , foreign policy , media and so on . 
  you ca n't create unity by slamming a gavel on a table but you can create conditions that increases the exchange between the nordic countries to the point where the idea of a unity becomes natural . 
  well it 's not like you ca n't argue convincingly that there are lots of upsides with a united norden without associating the idea with idiots . 
  well i have a knife and a bottle of koskenkorva so i guess i qualify . 
  that 's four merci though . 
  i have neither career , network nor friends so suck it !, 
  how about you get half of our journalists and we get half of yours , balance achieved . 
  glad to be of help , brother . 
  you can not if it 's irrelevant to the context is what it says . 
  we 've accumulated plenty of sand from our new countrymen for our heads to bury in . 
  edit : okay , i fucked this up . 
  it was supposed to be a joke about getting sand in your shoes but there 's no mention of shoes . 
  stupid me . 
  what 's wrong with the netherlands ? 
  `` try to stay pissed at us about this issue for a few more years '' . 
  i 'm sceptical about this comparison , as someone already mentioned some countries have mandatory military service and in sweden it 's very unusual for someone pursuing a msc in engineering to take out a bsc after three years , in fact at lund institute of technology there 's no requirement on people studying for msc in engineering to write a bachelor 's thesis . 
  furthermore in a booming economy it 's fairly common for people to skip out on taking their degree as they find jobs before they 're done with their thesis . 
  for example i had a co-worker who did n't finish his master 's thesis until he had twelve years of work experience because he was snatched by industry . 
  looks more like dancing . 
  i approve . 
  we just want a fair fight is all . 
  there is probably no underlying logic , she is just incredibly stupid . 
  in the beginning of the nineties there was a surge in immigration to sweden as well as xenophobia and racism . 
  this scene portrays a debate of sorts in the immigrant ghetto of rinkeby where the prime minister and his minister of immigration attended to give reassurance . 
  the minister of immigration has the brilliant idea that a singalong is just what 's needed . 
  kumbayah might work . 
  though we already tried [ we shall overcome ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=izqpmroclcm ) in sweden . 
  sure , why make an argument when you can write something stupid . 
  well that last thing seems a bit optimistic . 
  what if the comments are biased ? 
  yeeeeeaaah, 
  [ sure we did . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gustavus_adolphus_of_sweden ), 
  so not brb ? 
  it 's tiresome to hear of people speaking about the benefits in the long run when the long run has already occurred in some places . 
  in the long run you get malm\u00f6 , a city that have n't been able to balance a budget for years without significant financial assistance from the rest of sweden . 
  if malm\u00f6 was a country it would be worse off then greece and when the rest of sweden ends up in the same spot the people who rely on tax financed welfare are thoroughly fucked ( which ironically will be to a large extent the very same immigrants peoples hearts ache for ) . 
  you can not presuppose that foreign born people can be successfully integrated into society such that the foreign born pays in the same or more taxes than the native while using the same or less tax money . 
  it has n't happened after decades of trying and there 's no reason to believe it will be accomplished in the following decades . 
  making policy out of premises that are n't valid today and will probably not be valid tomorrow is unintelligent to express it modestly . 
  even if people accept the premise that a human has a duty to help any other human that needs it ( which many do n't and for valid reasons ) then i still have to ask , how much help will be available in a decade or in two ? 
  well the tax payers certainly are n't making any rules . 
  well the purpose of the eu is to meddle in the affairs of sovereign states . 
  i think you 're misinterpretating ( it 's written confusingly ) . 
  60 % of those who responded `` we 're at war with islam '' identified as danish people 's party voters appears more plausible . 
  that really depends on how the data was sampled . 
  for a random sample you can be reasonably sure the conclusion would n't change considerably in a repeat survey . 
  if they stratified over relevant demographic groups as well the uncertainty is very small . 
  though recently non-random or correlated sampling schemes have been employed ( typically in web panels ) for which it is hard to give any theoretical guarantees from the outside . 
  for the first two you should n't expect more than a couple percentage points difference in a repeat survey . 
  david irving , while certainly later on arguing very controversial points also made contributions to the history of ww2 . 
  he was jailed in austria . 
  firstly , the eurocrats will do that just fine without my help and secondly it wo n't be beautiful . 
  fuck no . 
  do n't try to drag us into your mess . 
  apparently they should have made a cancer prevention campaign instead . 
  the whole idea of democracy stems from ancient greece ; is this idea even more outdated ?

`` i dare say with confidence that , had us europeans not been around , it would 've been eastern asia that had come to lead the world for a significant period of time '' no shit ... 
  it is really amazing actually how a few european nations were able to completely dominate pretty much the entire world with a fraction of its population . 
  we call the ground floor the first in sweden too , danskj\u00e4vel . 
  you greatly overestimate russias military prowess compared to that of the eu which has three times the population , has more than 7 times larger gdp , has nukes and overall more advanced technology and not to mention would be defending . 
  it is also pretty much guaranteed that the us would intervene and aid the eu to sink every russian ship in the baltic , bombing all nearby military forces to oblivion and then stopping at russias border to avoid nuclear war . 
  the vietnamese population were also very poor and had little to lose by fighting . 
  the terrain where 95 % of sweden 's tiny population lives is also far less defensive than vietnam 's dense jungles . 
  if half the neo nazis live in russia that is extremely high per capita . 
  difference in total gdp . 
  please do !, 
  could we throw finland and the baltics on too ? 
  it seems like it , the parties of the former goverment seem butt hurt and do n't want to co operate for some idiotic reason . 
  `` collapse of the greens '', 
  i just voted for the left-center social democrats , i really hope we win . 
  that 's islam . 
  is n't russias economy mainly based on natural resources though which are abundant in the east and centre ? 
  by the way , would n't large parts of the russian forces be stationed in the east and to some extent the south to defend just in the same way large parts of us forces would remain in the americas ? 
  should n't this even out the odds ? 
  russia has more landmass to defend but fewer troops and much poorer power projection . 
  all right , you seem knowledgeable . 
  still , russia would n't attack a nato country unless they all become absolutely batshit insane and then they might use nukes and everyone is fucked anyway . 
  yes , it 's kind of insane really . 
  is n't a lot of russia 's military hardware old and their regular army just 100-200k troops though ? 
  would n't a highly technologically superiour force of 100 000 entrenched soldiers be able to halt the russians ? 
  if russia had problems invading chechnya how on earth would they attack the most powerful military power to ever exist ? 
  you would n't need half a million soldiers in eastern europe . 
  station 100 000 soldiers there with good air support and the russians would never get through unless they used nukes . 
  for perapective , the us already has 60 000 soldiers in europe . 
  ukraine is in neither the eu or nato , you ca n't determine how the west would act if poland or the baltics were attacked based on ukraine . 
  the us has ~ 60k troops in europe of which 40k are stationed in europe . 
  adding the military and aerial power of certain other nato contries poland could probably be held . 
  britain was far more powerful . 
  in some ways . 
  i would n't really call 1700 's china dominant , i would go a bit earlier than that , 1600 's maybe , before europe became so dominating . 
  they do not come close in any way to the power projection of the us , neither do they desire it . 
  excuse me ? 
  they did n't `` invade '' mali , they deployed a few hundred soldiers by request from the government to repel the brutal islamic fanatics trying to take over the country . 
  nah i got it , i just wanted to tell you guys how awful our army is . 
  you would probably win , no need to surrender , our army is a complete joke . 
  sorry , i misread . 
  azerbaijan is more than twice as large and has more than three times as many inhabitants ... 
  no , it is illegal to protest in many western countries . 
  the funny thing is that a popular demonstration demanding more freedom , tax cuts or something could be described in the exact same way in many western countries . 
  re-read my comment but substitute byzantine with eastern roman . 
  because those areas were truly part of the byzantine heartland . 
  why not both ? 
  9 % of the us gdp is n't exactly minor in any situation . 
  i would n't call canadas gdp a `` small number ... 
  they have the eleventh highest gdp in the world , just under russia . 
  better trade , lol . 
  you will further distance yourselves from the largest economic entity in the world . 
  i 'm not saying in large scale . 
  but since norway i right on the border to sweden it 's not wrong to assume that at least a few thousand people born there have moved to sweden the last few decades . 
  i know i was wrong but i 'm just saying the amount of african/arab/middle eastern is n't as high as people think . 
  the fact that there 's just 5 % muslims is quite telling . 
  that 's not a huge amount really , a decent amount of the non eu born people are norwegian too . 
  no it is n't , a large part of those are finns and people from the balkans which have integrated really well . 
  for reference , there are roughly 5 % muslims in sweden . 
  the vast majority . 
  only a small part of those 20 % have come recently from syria and somalia as refugees , most are either finns or from the balkans . 
  i literally could not are less about the joke you did . 
  i honestly think almost every possible combination of words would offend me more . 
  joking about you being part of the ottoman empire is not worse than spitting on someones parents grave for fucks sake . 
  you can joke about anything . 
  i hope you are trolling . 
  modern macedonia has ** nothing ** to do with historical macedonia . 
  i was clearly talking about the growth during the industrial revolution , not the larger period including the time before and after . 
  i said `` just look at the difference between 1820 and 1913 . '', 
  you are right about africa but european growth was exceptional . 
  just look at the difference between 1820 and 1913 . https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_population_estimates, 
  lol ? 
  they have the perfect climate . 
  europe surpassed africa in population during the industrial revolution . 
  `` it 's true that a recent report by three u.n. agencies said nearly 239 million in africa are hungry , a figure some 20 million higher than four years ago . 
  and recent crises in the horn of africa and sahel certainly highlight the desperate uncertainties of food supply for millions -- malnutrition still cuts deep scars into progress on health and education . 
  but the africa progress panel and many others believe that africa has the potential not only to feed itself , but also to become a major food supplier for the rest of the world consider , for example , africa 's agricultural land . 
  according to an influential recent analysis , africa has around 600 million hectares of uncultivated arable land , roughly 60 percent of the global total . '', 
  ** slams **, 
  studying some histology before i play laserdome with a few friends . 
  what do you mean ? 
  get some cute little ducks , 
  thank you , your comment both warms and saddens my heart . 
  you sound intelligent too , if you intend to move from poland i would be honored if you moved here . 
  that 's a nice reply . 
  i do n't agree with you completely but you make some good points . 
  sorry for being rude . 
  oh right , i thought it was all refugees . 
  sorry if i sounded judgemental . 
  moldavia has just 3 million inhabitants and is the poorest country in europe by quite a bit . 
  christianity is the largest religion and the estonian culture and values is in many ways connected to christianity since it has been present in their history for centuries . 
  it 's the same with all cultures really . 
  indian culture is affected by hinduism and japanese by shinto . 
  no one is asking you to take in an unlimited number of imigrants ... stop being so fucking sensationalistic and scared just because a tiny amount of people settle in your country . 
  it 's not like 200 poor people imigrating to a country of millions a year is going to have an affect on the country , just admit that you are a racist and do n't want dirty syrians in your country . 
  8000 people over three years ... ? 
  that is almost as pathetically low . 
  you could literally do that more than 1875 years and still only reach norway current population . 
  i 'm not advocating taking in as many as we do ( it 's a bit too many honestly ) but we really should be splitting the ones coming to europe more evenly for better integration . 
  the richer countries could even subsidise with some money . 
  why the hell would fourth generation immigrants feel alienated and torn between two cultures ... ?

  i guess that is what i should expect from someone who thinks spain has the right to overfish , brake the law and just generally ruin for the rest of the world with your overfishing . 
  and , you will never explain , you just say that . 
  the thing is , there is not solution , which both you and i know . 
  but you do not care about that , instead of looking at what * is * happening at the moment you claim as long as there is greed and corruption in the world , you * never ever * have to explain , anything . 
  that is such a cowardly way out , one can never erdicate that . 
  you can always point to one person and say `` look - he is greedy , i can not answer '' . 
  but , what one could do , is look at what * is * happening in the world right now , which is massive pollution and climate change and fight it with the best available technology. , you however do not want that , you want to keep polluting . 
  i guess with your attitude towards over fishing i should expect no less . 
  you do not give a shit , about climate or environment , you just want spain to have the right to fuck up for everyone , like with overfishing . 
   the risks are lower in the other path . 
  no , and if you are going to make that statement i want scientific proof for that . 
  i challenge you with this report , that speaks against you . 
  please , tell me in detail what is wrong with the latest ipcc report about climate change ( i have n't even started about the rest of the pollution ) and give me just as credible report that basically proves , like the ipcc report proves that climate change is happening that what you say is going to happen will happen . 
  please , show me that report . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.ipcc.ch/ ) no , you will not , it does n't exist . 
  you jut do not have any answers are far to much of a coward to admit it . 
  rather that dealing with the current reapity you make up threats . 
  we are the first country with a plan , but please i am waiting to hear what you are going to do with the co2 emissions you prefer before nuclear . 
  i 'd like to hear your plan for that and for climate change . 
  that is happening now , do before you criticise something quality far , far less emissions i 'd like to hear your plan - in great detail please . 
  how are you going to fix climate change ? 
  capture co2 ? 
  go on , you prefer that to nuclear so you have to have a bloody good plan then . 
  yes , we are just waiting for the last ok . have plan , is ok ` ed by the international whatever the agency is called . 
  i think we start around 2020 . 
  can you tell me how dk and germany are going to capture the pollution is letting out and the co2 emissions . 
  you have no plan for that do you ? 
  it seems to me sweden with its nuclear is far ahead of germany and denmark . 
  and that is because the germans and danes chose it . 
  why ? 
  but right now germany is moving away from nuclear , so unless imported ( which would be beyond hypocritical and please do not be like the danes who do that ) at least germany 's mix will be no nuclear . 
  and , because of that germany chooses co2 emission , pollution and climate change above the safe technology that is nuclear . 
  but for other countries maybe you are right , but unfortunately germany and denmark seems determined to stick to co2 emissions . 
  not true , and both you and i know it . 
  you are  this whole thing started because i said i do n't like pride parades . 
  not because they are gay , but because they are to flashy for me . 
  liar , you did n't like gays . 
  but , do you know , i 'll dig up your old post - * just for you * so i can prove not just on r/sweden , but also on / r/europe that you are a liar . 
  is n't it bad that you can not delete my posts ? 
   while i 'm no big fan of fracking , gas is currently our best bet . 
  it is waaaaay cleaner than coal or oil . 
  no , nuclear is , but germany and denmark refuse to accept that . 
  i think a lot of germans suffer with you . 
  jokes about sweden/dk aside denmark 's and germany 's energy politics actually pisses me off . 
  you guys ( not you personally ) have all the recourses to fix most of the co2 emissions , if not all , but refuse to . 
  that makes me far not annoyed than at struggling countries that do not have a chance . 
   and danish education does not at any point say that coal is better than nuclear . 
  how and why should i be the one to educate people about nuclear ? 
  and i think generally people do n't feel the need for nuclear and i have never heard about all of the swedish people that suffer the consequences of this ? 
  so , why have n't the danes in 40 years grasped the fact that coal lets outr for more co2 than nuclear if your education is so good ? 
  and if your education , like you are saying , have taught the danes that you do n't think it is * necessary * to fix the co2 emissions , then it is a shitty bad education . 
  i mean , we are in the worlds first , biggest and ** catastrophic * humanly engineered climate change with a new mass death of animals , no idea of how many degrees the climate will change but the danes do n't even feel a basic need to fight that and to educate people ? 
  that is what you are saying . 
  please , explain why you are so special , so unique that you can just have the right to ignore technology , far , far safer than coal and just keep on ruining the climate - for decades . 
  i am so waiting for that explanation - because that is what denmark is doing . 
  so , i guess that is what you are tought . 
   i agree that danes are generally uneducated about nuclear , but even though they were i still think there would be a lot of people that would be very unhappy about it . 
  so , now they are uneducated . 
  well , that is a choice then by the government i guess . 
  honestly , not my problem . 
  educate them or overrule them . 
  a lot of people are unhappy about gay marriages and interracial marriages . 
  we , just as denmark in those cases and as educated and civilised people everywhere , do n't give a toss about those idiots , and do the right thing anyway . 
  and , you have had 50 years to educate people . 
  so , ignore them and build . 
   that is impossible for denmark to have so would have to rely on other things true , like france , or japan , or , uk etc - one build nuclear plants . 
  like most countries in the world , i think it very few that have hydro power like we have . 
  but , had we thought like the danes we would have been half hydro , half coal ... . . that would have been enormously stupid , would n't it ? 
  so , why is n't it stupid when denmark does it ? 
  why ? 
   where are your sources exactly that says that the danish coal consumption apparently kills millions of people ? 
  coal maybe kills millions in the world every year but that is not in denmark or in sweden , i would guess it could almost entirely be china , our coal power plants are far more sophisticated and environmentally friendly than those in china . 
  i never said in denmark , but denmark contributes . 
  just like i never said 17 000 / year in sweden , of course not . 
  but , i also said that the easy coal deaths , not the astma and * i did n't even talk about denmarks co2 emissions that the danes willingly spew out in the athmosphere to ruin the climate * . 
   i have never heard about all of the swedish people that suffer the consequences of this ? 
  not just swedes . 
  are you saying you and the rest of denmark do not know about environmental pollution and coal ? 
  and are you saying that danes do not know that * willingly choosing co2 emissions over non co2 emissions is bad * ? 
  then you are uneducated as fuck , and frankly , i think the danes know about pollution and climate change . 
  it is really one of two things . 
  either the danes are dumb as rocks and have no clue about co2 emissions , pollution - nothing . 
  or they know , but willingly choose co2 because they do n't really give a single fuck about the environement . 
  which one is it ? 
  personally i do n't think most of you are dumb as fuck , i just do n't think you give a single care about how you affect the world , the climate , the air . 
  if danes are still against -  it seems like you have a hatred towards danes and denmark . 
  haha , no , i have danish family . 
  but against your energy politics . 
  and danes who do not have the facts , which among other is you . 
  it feels like danes just ignore the fact that they decade after decade pew out emissions , refuse to face the facts ( wind power will never , ever cover your needs ) . 
   sweden has put the danish people at higher risk with the barseb\u00e4ck nuclear power plant , with it being 20 km away from copenhagen . 
  so , stop buying from us . 
  i think that is a grand idea . 
  you do not want nuclear - do n't buy from us . 
  the hydro is up north , you are not getting it . 
  it is rathe hypocritical is n't it not wanting nuclear by you , but not minding buying it from others . 
  swedes can die from nuclear , and danes have a right to spew out co2 and ruin the climate according to the danes , because that is the danish policy . 
  i look at what you do , not say . 
  and , if we stopped cooperating about electricity , i 'd laugh myself into next week . 
  our needs are covered - always .

  swedish figures for the first six months 2017 compared to 2016 ( when the numbers fell drastically compared to 2015 ) . 
  i included the top 10 countries , middle east or not . 
  number in parenthesis is the total number of applicants for the period . 
  * syria : down 41 % ( 1873 ) * iraq : down 40 % ( 952 ) * afghanistan : down 47 % ( 930 ) * stateless : down 26 % ( 540 ) * eritrea : down 20 % ( 531 ) * iran : down 27 % ( 502 ) * turkey : up 213 % ( 457 ) * georgia : up 5 % ( 399 ) * somalia : down 59 % ( 387 ) * albania : down 6 % ( 320 ), 
  [ hemnet ] ( https://www.hemnet.se ) has basically everything you can buy . 
  swedish only . 
  i 'd say it 's becoming more and more popular since it was declared a national holiday back in 2005 . 
  still no huge celebrations though . 
  most people i know have a picnic , a nice dinner or something along those lines . 
  there 's also official celebrations in every part of sweden . 
  citizenship ceremonies are usually on this day as well . 
  for a flat electricity is about 32-40 $ / month and water is included in the fee/rent of a flat . 
  i found an example calculation for a free-standing house with a yearly water consumption of 150 000 liters , and that would be 425 euros/year or just over 35 euros/month . 
  i 'm sorry , that 's simply not true no matter how much it 's being said on reddit . 
  when eating out most people do tip , either by rounding up or giving 5-10 % . 
  some people also round taxi fares . 
  it is n't a social requirement to tip , but most people do it anyway , especially if they had a pleasant evening . 
  i mean it 's common ( at least at better places ) , but of course it 's still optional . 
  the norm is to tip 5-10 % at dinner restaurants when you have a waiter . 
  otherwise tipping is weird . 
  service fees/tip are never included in the bill . 
  prints on the receipt stating that the tip is n't included are seen as unethical by both the restaurant employers organisation and the hotel - and restaurant workers union . 
  smoking is n't that common in sweden ( thanks to snus ) , 8 % of all men and 10 % of all women smokes daily . 
  down from 13 , and 15 % in 2006 . 
  i usually check multiple stores to see if i find something i like . 
  for everyday stuff i usually go to [ brothers ] ( https://www.brothers.se ) , and for jeans i almost always shop at [ jc ] ( https://www.jc.se ) . 
  35 year olds was born in 1982 , just saying, 
  [ it 's friday !, 
  the most unique is probably the [ tunnbr\u00f6dsrulle ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h4bkukd-huw/uvmo6ye_nii/aaaaaaaabse/n8_naf9pdtk/s1600/dsc_0788.jpg ) basically it 's one or two hot dogs , mashed potatoes , salad , creamy shrimp salad and all in a soft flatbread . 
  22 right now though . 
  i like it when it 's between 10 and 15 degrees in the middle of the night , makes it far easier to sleep . 
  a reasonable 12 degrees outside right now . 
  [ kent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nrcr1qihb4 ) , [ loads ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jocj9rld88 ) , of [ good ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwxur_vdwwe ) , [ songs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykm558k_d0w ) , [ they had a long career ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7jgiz81vmy ) sadly they stopped [ last year ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buboci11sps ), 
  the electricity provider , and i was wrong , there 's actually over 100 different companies to chose from . 
  the companies does n't have to sell their `` own '' power , they buy from the nordpool spot market at fixed rates , and sell the electricity to costumers . 
  so it 's completely normal to live in [ lule\u00e5 ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/place/lule%c3%a5/@65.5870972,22.1463379,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x467f6314d2e8b867:0x4034506de8c8620!8m2!3d65.584819!4d22.1567026 ) and have `` varberg energi '' as your power company , of course based in [ varberg ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/place/varberg/@58.6561046,20.4827319,6.17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x465029e864525f1d:0x4019078290e7b80!8m2!3d57.107118!4d12.2520907 ), 
  you are billed separately for the actual electricity and the grid . 
  i feel this is the phase we 're going through right now . 
  it 's a race to the bottom and it 's simply not possible to not be a part of it i 'm afraid . 
  i seriously do n't understand the question , anyone care to explain ? 
  yes , the * rental * market , 25 % of all swedes live in a rented apartment . 
  the rest either owns their own house , or live in a type of condominium known as a `` bostadsr\u00e4tt '' . 
  these markets work exactly as you 'd expect them . 
  the rental market is regulated , and the rent is set by a form of collective bargaining , pretty much the same way as wages are decided upon . 
  there is a waiting list in most cities . 
  as the price of each apartment is fixed the one with the longest time in the queue that has shown interest in it get it . 
  it 's generally a harmful system , and different political parties have different ideas regarding how it should be reformed as they want to avoid high rent increases that force people out of their homes . 
  sure , it 's what i do when changing power company . 
  i 'd say it 's mostly good , with a few exceptions . 
  i like the fact that i can choose between three train operators between stockholm and gothenburg , i also very much like the fact that i can now get painkillers at a grocery store , and also choose between 20 , maybe 30 different power companies . 
  however , i 'm not really a fan of the deregulation of vehicle inspections . 
  not because i do n't trust the private companies ( they still need to be accredited ) , but because it 's damn annoying looking through all the different companies homepages for a free time slot . 
  worth noticing is that in all deregulated sectors the old government enterprise till exist and compete on equal terms as the private alternatives . 
  if they work for a county the average is $ 47 000/year , in private sector it 's $ 52 000/year . 
  the salary itself is n't terrible , but it is a stressfull work . 
  deregulation has been massive over the last 25 years . 
  just concentrate on something else . 
   what country are you from ? 
  see flair  what do you like about your healthcare system ? 
  it 's open for everyone , it gives me the choice to choose my provider , statistics are easy to find , and results are pretty good . 
   how is it paid for ? 
  taxes , and a small out of pocket expense ( maximum $ 125 per year and maximum $ 250 per year for prescription drugs ) . 
   is it efficient ? 
  cost effective , mortality rates , etc are my parameters for this question we have the same public spending per capita as the us , our private spending is a lot lower though as you might have guessed . 
  5-year survivability for cancer is 71.4 % survivability after a heart attack ( both in and outside a hospital ) : 73 %  are you satisfied with your healthcare ? 
  generally , yes . 
   are there private providers ? 
  yes , but they are in the same system as the public providers . 
  thus you do n't pay anything extra . 
  it is also possible to have private insurance in order to get full private care . 
  only about 6 % of all swedes have private health insurance . 
   any personal anecdotes ? 
  do n't really go to the doctor that often , but last time i did i got to see my gp and get a recipe within 24h , which is decent i think . 
   what could be improved in the system ? 
  we need more nurses , like a lot more nurses . 
  problem is that it 's not a very attractive job at the moment , so they could use higher salaries for example . 
  since the healthcare is organised by the counties there are some differences in quality , some hospitals also have unreasonable waiting times at the emergency room . 
  i think this is partly due to the lack of staff , but also due to incompetence by the people in charge . 
  just want to add that mil is also used by government agencies , so it 's not just your everyday swede that use it . 
  the tax agency for example use the * mil * for everything that has to do with distances ( deductions , company car benefits etc. 
  pickled herring ( inlagd sill ) comes to mind ( not to be confused with fermented herring , aka surstr\u00f6mming ), 
  about 50 % of swedes live in a house that they own . 
  i 'd say many have their own house as a `` life goal '' . 
  here 's and [ example ] ( https://www.maklarhuset.se/bostad/sverige/uppsala/storvreta/olle-akares-vag/314081?referrer=hemnet#bilder ) of a typical ( well , this one is very nicely renovated ) house , built in 1946 . 
  [ another example ] ( https://widerlov.se/tillsalu/cmvilla4l8j69gd3e12l77s?showimages=true ), 
  it 's literally top of the page on svts news site . 
  technically they 're allowed to move , there was one ( sketchy ) football club here that did just that for this season . 
  opposing fans are shouting `` murderers '' and hoping they will be relegated at the end of the season , and since they 're dead last that will probably happen as well . . 
  clubs here have such rich history related to where they 're from . 
  [ hammarby ] ( http://www.stockholmdirekt.se/_internal/cimg!0/kebpsdxuiobg5hoboa47uk5vcb1hixf ) is a team from `` s\u00f6der '' , the southern parts of stockholm , there is no s\u00f6der without hammarby , and there is no hammarby without s\u00f6der . 
  they exist to play the sport , no ? 
  business in the sense that they need to make ends meet , otherwise no . 
  do n't know if it 's regional or not , but doing a u-turn in the middle of the road ( without there being an intersection or roundabout ) is often called * rallarsv\u00e4ng * '' [ navvy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/navvy ) turn '' , or * g\u00f6ra en pajas * `` do a clown '' . 
  norway 2 . 
  finland 3 . 
  germany 5 . 
  27 % of the population between the age of 25 and 64 have at least 3 years post high-school education . 
  this percentage increase by about .5 points every year . 
  how many of those that have masters degrees i do n't know . 
  another 15 % has a post high-school education that 's shorter than 3 years .

  i still ca n't believe how this is an alternate version of a b-side that never ended up on an album ( other than a b-side collection ) . 
  i * love * this song . 
  [ flicka med guld ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kgenx5e-nc ) - joakim th\u00e5str\u00f6m . 
  the most beautiful love song i 've ever heard , and i 've still not decided if it 's happy or sad yet . 
  [ du f\u00e5r g\u00f6ra som du vill ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jdng6y6uwi ) - patrik isaksson . 
  he can become a little repetitive since this is the only kind of music that he really does , but this is still a magical song . 
  [ under ytan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chy8t_9m9dq ) - uno svenningsson . 
  this has been one of my favorite songs ever since i was a child . 
  it 's just so haunting . 
  there are 50 areas with various levels of criminality , and in five or six of them , it 's especially bad . 
  they are n't no-go zones , but they can be a challenge for the police ( especially since the police get little more than a hot dog and a pat on the back in terms of resources to actually operate with ) . 
  hahaha . 
  let me reassure you that it 's meant more as `` i want to live my whole life in the north '' rather than some sort of viking battlecry . 
  there is ? 
  that 's cool , did n't know that . 
  yeah , he 's probably the most well-known politician we 've had , although i had n't guessed people outside of sweden still remembered him . 
  it 's a careful balance . 
  being part of a military alliance obviously has certain advantages in terms of potential support if things were to go sideways somehow , but at the same time we are sort of a neutral buffer zone between nato and russia . 
  if both finland and sweden were to join nato , nato would gain control over basically the entire baltic sea . 
  that would shift the balance of power in that region immensely , and the consequences of such shifts can be hard to predict . 
  at the very least it would heighten the tensions in that area , which is not something that needs to happen right now . 
  ... unless the tensions grow so much that it 'd be advisable to join nato out of self-preservation after all . 
  as i said , it 's a balancing act . 
  i never meant that the us is n't actually part of north america . 
  it most definitely is , just like russia is without a doubt a european country ( as well as an asian one ) . 
  what i meant was that both the us and russia seem to operate , politically , on a much higher level than as just a one part of a continent . 
  russia is n't just `` a european power '' like any other - its a global superpower . 
  the us , likewise , is politically so much more than just a north american country . 
  when i look at both of you on the global political stage i see you more as two singular forces than as `` only '' part of north america or europe/asia . 
  i hope that makes sense . 
  that 's not to say that i do n't view the us and russia as north american or european/asian in other contexts . 
  if i met you on my travels , you 'd most definitely be a north american to me . 
  * facepalms * so obvious !, 
  how could i forget him ? 
  1 ) you have * way * too many famous people . 
  share some with the rest of us . 
  2 ) ruth negga 's irish ? 
  that 's cool , did n't know that . 
  i really liked her on agents of shield , and i heard that she did really , really well in some movie that i ca n't for the life of me remember the name of now . 
  dammit . 
  3 ) dara o'briain is dope . 
  i 've loved him for years and years . 
  so incredibly funny . 
  :d 4 ) graham norton is one of my favorite talk show hosts . 
  no matter the guests , the interviews always turn hilarious . 
  i feel that it 's similar to the suggestion of alfred nobel by yosoyunpayaso above you : people certainly know about both of their legacies , but i do n't think that they themselves are all that well-known . 
  abba and ikea still tends to be the sort of go-to , stereotypical answers i see when people try to sum up sweden quickly , but i agree : if you asked someone just off the street to name someone from sweden , i think they 'd be much more likely to say zlatan than abba . 
  it depends on whether or not you prefer ice hockey or football . 
  the hockey team hears it quite often at the end of games ; the football team , not so much . 
  :p but on a more serious note : i used to know it , but since i never sing it anymore i ca n't say for sure that i would be able to sing it perfectly now . 
  it 's not especially long , it 's just that everything kind of blurs together . 
  but i 've always liked how it promotes nordic unity rather than some sort of swedish exceptionalism or anything like that , so i try to never forget it * too * much . 
  everyone seems to know about abba , even if i doubt most people could name the actual people that made up the group . 
  nowadays i 'd probably say zlatan ibrahimovic . 
  you probably have to be interested in football to know him ( at least if you 're outside of europe ) , but i struggle to come up with a bigger name . 
  they are europeans , in an absolute sense . 
  part of russia is in europe , and most russians live there . 
  no question . 
  but i also feel that they transcend their geographical location somewhat . 
  they are not a `` european player '' when it comes to world politics , but a `` world player '' . 
  much in the same way that i do n't consider the us to be a north american player . 
  both nations operate at a different level than say sweden , who will probably always be a `` european nation '' when it comes to world politics . 
  so when i do n't consider russia 's politics european , it 's not because i do n't consider them to be europeans but rather that i consider them to be much more than europeans . 
  we are all different countries and while we are very similar on the whole , we still have our own political and economical realities to deal with . 
  there is n't any reason for us to join up any more than we already do . 
  the five nordic countries cooperate in a bunch of ways , especially through the nordic council . 
  we 're almost a mini-eu as is , so there is n't really a need to develop it further . 
  the way things are right now works out great , since we get all the perks of that close cooperation while not being tied to each other in the areas where our interests diverge in important ways . 
  norway and iceland are n't part of the eu , while sweden , denmark and finland are ; norway , iceland and denmark are part of nato , while finland and sweden are n't . 
  the countries all have their reasons for staying out of the respective organisations and being forced into either because we are part of some pan-nordic/scandinavian state would n't benefit anyone . 
  except maybe eu/nato themselves . 
  i love our forests . 
  they can be magical . 
  i used to love walking in them when i was younger . 
  you can either take a gander at a general google search for [ swedish forests ] ( https://www.google.se/search?q=svensk+skog&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=590&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewif2fjb7u_rahwqf5okhqf_bswq_auibigb#q=svensk+skog&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbs=isz:l ) or look at these pictures : [ 1 ] ( http://cdnx.nwt.se/inkommande/opbgnf-2417080.jpg/alternates/free_1140/2417080.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.skogssverige.se/sites/skogssverige.se/files/styles/large/public/images/portals/bild1273_-_skog.jpg?itok=ph-7jqvr ) , [ 3 ] ( https://hallbarahokarangen.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/skog1.jpg ) , [ 4 ] ( http://www.naturskyddsforeningen.se/sites/default/files/styles/artikelbild/public/artikelbilder/skogssluttning_986x370.jpg?itok=yywcdtgl ) , [ 5 ] ( http://naturarvet.se/wp-content/uploads/2013/05mossmatta.jpg ) , and [ 6 ] ( http://www.naturvardsverket.se/upload/var-natur/skyddad-natur/nationalparker/hamra/hamra-skog-027nf672-hog.jpg ), 
  i used to be basically cashless until my local store began refusing my card for no discernible reason . 
  i do n't have that problem anywhere else , but i need to have some cash on me if i want to be able to buy groceries . 
  annoying . 
  but i would go cashless if i could , and if it were n't for this particular store 's technical problems it certainly would n't be a problem in sweden . 
  there 's a lot of shit going on , but in the end there is only one thing that i think would be really bad : breaking up the eu . 
  i still do n't think that 's especially likely to happen , but brexit has shaken that certainty a lot . 
  now i feel that the eu is under attack on a lot of different fronts , both from within and from the outside . 
  but assuming that we do n't do anything stupid and the eu stays strong , i do n't really foresee any problems that we ca n't fix . 
  as some of the other people have said , if you 're old enough , you 've seen europe and the world deal with a lot of shit before . 
  sure , there are fires out there , but there are also plenty of flowers growing from the ashes of fires we 've already put out . 
  the problem i have is more that there are five permanent members of the council , rather than who those members are . 
  i have no problem with france and uk being there per se , but it all feels very elitist when they can not be replaced . 
  i also think that it harms the un 's credibility when the biggest nations constantly get their say and the right to veto decisions . 
  the un works best if everyone agrees that they represents the world at large and not just a few chosen nations . 
  but if you 're dealing with a nation or leader from africa , the middle east or perhaps southeast asia , and they say that the un mainly represents the interests of the superpowers ... they 're kinda right . 
  that becomes a problem if neither the government or the populace of said country respects un 's authority , because that hampers the un 's ability to act immensely . 
  and there are certainly times when we really , really need the un to be able to act . 
  but as i said , that 's more of a structural problem i have with the un rather than a problem i have with either the uk or france ( or the us , russia or china , for that matter ) . 
  i ca n't really speak for the netherlands . 
  never been there . 
  but the dutch seem like decent folks . 
  even if they do joke like that with their friends , i 'm sure they can vary their teasing to an appropriate level depending on who they 're talking with . 
  i 'll throw in sweden and norway as travel tips . 
  i 've never been to norway 's fjords , but i hear they 're amazing .

  i 've never been to belarus , and not going to bother going to a country requiring you to get a visa for a visit ( lol !, 
  ai n't nobody got time for that ) , but i 'd be curious to learn more about their situation . 
  interesting to see how the western and eastern bloc nations have fared since the cold war . 
  my northerner pal estonia seems to have been doing very well . 
  my esti friend told me about their alko-taxi , a boat serving finns with cheap booze . 
  free market at it 's best !, 
  in my newspaper here in sweden , there were a ton of articles for a while about how estii schools were superior to ours , even if we spend more money on ours . 
  `` what can we learn from them '' and so on . 
  cheers to all eurofriends out there . 
  speaking of which , here is [ a great british radio show about billy the bookcase from ikea ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04nmxy2 ), 
  good to be the top bun in the sandwich, 
  suck it , other scandilosers !, 
  something akin to denmark , australia or japan . 
  basically open borders for skilled workers , but not for others . 
  but before the 2018 election , i guess i have some reading to do wrt moderaterna , so i could be wrong . 
  true true, 
  that depends on * how strict * you mena . 
  many nations have shameful pasts - few acknowledge it . 
  britain , france , spain & nl have colonizing pasts that are worse than the nazi holocaust - the rwandan genocide , stalin and mao were both much worse in terms of the amount of carnage . 
  my country ( sweden ) has a horrible history of mistreating the same people ( aka lapp - hence the name `` lapland '' for what maybe should be called `` same land '' ) . 
  but many people from those countries do n't accept it as a bad thing - and many are even proud . 
  shit was bad yo !, 
  til , sadly :( . 
  while that might be true , since they are already part of the political elite in germany , i 'm sure many think of a vote for them is a vote for the status quo . 
  it ai n't easy , that 's what it is !, 
  germans should be fucking proud of how they are handling their genocide . 
  many nations have dark histories , but very few own up to it . 
  mad respect to . de for that . 
  now the question is : how can i vote for a restrictive policy for asylum seekers , without getting this grab-bag of loonies in the mix ? 
  we have the same problem in sweden - only one party which does not have a super-liberal immigration policy - but it 's also the party that has a bunch of crazy `` ex '' - nazis . 
  sitting in my lonely chamber i yearn for more direct influence over how i 'm governed . 
  like choosing different representatives for different topics , or actually being allowed to vote on individual motions in the parlament instead of just choosing a representative . 
  all we have is ** now ** . 
  `` celebrating my heritage '' is more about the now than it is about the past , at least in reality ( even if we have ideas about `` past '' - but ideas are only something existing in the ** now ** as well ) . 
  heritage is also something that only exists ** now ** - the way i celebrate my old traditions is not how they were celebrated in 1300 , and when i try to celebrate like it was 1399 , i 'm actually not . 
  i 'm celebrating like it was 2017 , and the imagined past is part of that . 
  celebrating oktoberfest as part of your heritage is n't * really * about doing the same thing as grandpa 's grandpa , but about the community that you are in ** now ** . 
  but i definitely understand what you mean as well . 
  are n't you using the language of the english ? 
  it was a joke !, 
  i can only say the same  . 
  been there thrice , only on the east coast so far . 
  cheers !, 
  abschluss ( or absclu\u00df ) means finishing something . 
  welcome to europe and r/europe !,

  how does that work for northern ireland ? 
  seems easiest to trade it to roi in exchange for an underwater pipeline of guinness . 
  i 'll be over for a beer if you 'll airbnb me, 
  time for bayexit ? 
  * not at all . 
  the only use of christianity we have is that we take days off on christian holidays . 
  but it is cultural heritage and as such has a very special place , which is not true for `` newer '' religions here ( such as islam or new-age religions ) . 
  * russia is definitely european , as much as france , england or portugal . 
  it 's a shame the cold war separated europe as much as it did . 
  * good . 
  also love not living with them lol . 
  * we have a culture of being independent , but not the same as in america . 
  here if you live with your parents after 20 people people shake their heads . 
  i hear it 's different in the south - the banter goes that in italy they live with mama until 30 . 
  * guess why you want to move out asap ?!, 
  * cousins - close . 
  one step further : no contact basically . 
  sad !, 
  nope . 
  here in scandinavia it 's mostly hunters on the countryside who own them , and recently immigrant gangsters in the newly formed ghettos . 
  very sad :( . 
  no such thing - weddings are not about contracts or anything . 
  do n't ask me what girls care about - i never seem to understand what they want anyways ... 3 . 
  not forgotten . 
  i think the main reason why we are happy to give up national rule for european rule is because anything is better than killing each other . 
  sometimes feeling queasy about power moving further away from the people , but anything beats wars so i 'm ok with the eu . 
  we do have elections for the eu , we chose the parties to sit in the parlament . 
  i 'd like more direct democracy , but for now representative democracy has to suffice . 
  not a threat , people vote for what they wish . 
  i 'm freelancing , and the client is in london . 
  i got a 20 % salary decrease after the vote , and when we made the next contract they got a 25 % price increase from me . 
  wish it was n't so . 
  wish they 'd stay , but it 's their choice and i respect that . 
  not with erdogan acting the way he does . 
  turkey is always switching between being european and arab . 
  lately they seem to be leaning more to arabia . 
  ireland is a tax haven while being inside of the eu - so you 'll find a lot of international business there . 
  great if you want to work in it . 
  iceland not so much . 
  afaik they support themselves thru tourism and fishing , as well as bj\u00f6rk record sales . 
  fish is nice , it 's a great island to visit as a tourist , and bj\u00f6rk ... 
  i 'd lie if i did n't say i have a life-long crush on that girl ... 
  there is no one place to startups . 
  you 'll find the funding capital in london or stockholm . 
  you 'll find the coolest hacks and cheap apartments in berlin . 
  extremely good . 
  have never been that far away from home , but my father has been there for work many times . 
  brings home the best food . 
  have had a lot of work mates from india , all of whom have been cool guys . 
  many beers have been had . 
  i feel close to my other nordic friends - estonia , finland , norway , denmark , iceland , greenland & the faroe islands . 
  i see those nations as my brothers and sisters . 
  weirdly enough , some voice inside of me wants to count the netherlands in there as well ... 2 . 
  i think pretty good - since we are all afraid of china running ahead of us and russia starting world war 3 ( they are already waging war in europe - in eastern ukraine ) .

you 're right about english being the established language in pretty much all fields requiring higher education , though i 'm not certain that includes all countries , especially not at the native level . 
  it might be the norm in sweden and finland ( as mentioned in the vid ) and perhaps most of western europe , but i doubt that 's the case for the east and south unless you have any sources on that . 
  also , it does n't mean that a switch is impossible . 
  the idea would be to slowly phase in esperanto via education , first compulsory alongside english ( or just single compulsory in countries where english is n't already ) , then single compulsory after say 10 years when it might have attained a viable community of its own , and finally adopted as the sole working language when speakers have become numerous enough for the language to actually be viable as a working language . 
  while it would make sense to have english be the working language due to the simple fact that it 's essentially become the lingua franca , i 'm not so sure many would be so happy about it . 
  the french guy 's opinion , while almost nonexistent here , is something i 've heard a lot in hungary , and i 'd imagine not being too uncommon in other parts of europe . 
  anybody else have any similar experiences ? 
  what 's it like in your country ? 
  personally , i 'd prefer some neutral language like esperanto take the place as working language . 
  it 's supposedly easy to learn , has no overt cultural associations and constructed to be similar to most european ( or at least indo-european ) languages . 
  as a mere tool for communication , it seems to fit perfectly imo . 
  glad to see you became mod !, 
  you 're most certainly the right person for the job , in my honest opinion !, 
  might be , though most homeless people i 've seen have seemed swedish , at least judging from their accents . 
  the last example i 've seen with roma people in pretty much every major european city i 've been too . 
  that 's different , then we 're talking about transliteration , which is different from translation . 
  if it 's in a foreign script , then of course it has to be transliterated , as otherwise it 'd be completely illegible . 
  however , if the names written in the same script as one 's own ( in this case , roman ) , then i see no reason to change that , except for technical limitations , but that 's pretty much been made a non-issue thanks to modern computers . 
  myself , when i write a name down in say a paper , i always make sure to preserve the original spelling if it 's in roman , even if it 's something as complicated as vietnamese . 
  if i transliterate it , i look up one form that i stick to ; for example , i always use [ scientific transliteration for cyrillic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientific_transliteration_of_cyrillic ) or [ hepburn romanization ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hepburn_romanization ) for japanese . 
  what i choose depends on how well it preserves the original spelling , how well it can represent the language phonetically , how common it is and whether it 's officially recommended by said country 's own authorities or not . 
  pc keyboards have it too . 
  only problem is that it 's region specific . 
  here in sweden , keyboard come with the standard \u00c5\u00c4\u00d6 , plus the ability to add accute and grave accents , tildes , circumflexes and umlauts to certain letters ( mostly vowels ) . 
  i type with a hungarian keyboard , which includes all hungarian characters plus relevant diacritics for german , polish , czech , slovak , romanian , slovene , serbo-croat and albanian . 
  my point is that one should be able to have every diacritic for every european country , or at least for those part of the eu . 
  the swedish keayboard lacks \u0110\u0111 and \u0141\u0142 for examples , why hungarian ones ca n't type ca n't produce \u00c5\u00e5 , even though they can type \u016e\u016f , which is just plain stupid . 
  eastern name order . 
  cultural thing . 
  do n't know why though . 
  all i know is that it 's common in east asia ( china , japan , korea , vietnam etc. ), 
  and , for some reason , hungary . 
  can be nice sometimes though . 
  for example , i always used my hungarian name order when i was studying japanese for that reason ... also because it was easier to pronounce . 
  i know , i hate that just as much . 
  i keep wondering why they ca n't add a h\u00e1\u010dek here or an accent there when it 's all easily available in microsoft word or copypastable from wikipedia . 
  hell , this is the eu and i 'm still waiting for a keyboard equipped with all of our funny characters on one set . 
  or any other religion for that matter . 
  the catholic church is n't too positive about it and i ca n't imagine the calvinists being that either . 
  it would n't be so bad if people could just stop translating and applying it to foreign names . 
  i still remember when i was in lithuania and i saw a picture of bush on newspaper front , headlined `` d\u017eiord\u017eas v. bu\u0161as something something lithuanian '' . 
  it was as awful as it was hilarious . 
  i 've hear lots about relative poverty here , but nothing measuring absolute poverty in this country . 
  i 'm not surprised though , if you 're unemployed you 'll receive social security grants . 
  i 've you 've got kids , grants for those too . 
  got a place to live in ? 
  here 's a tiny one to help you along . 
  addicted to drugs ? 
  you 'll be put through rehab till you 're judged to be able to function normally again . 
  ca n't handle money , property or your own daily needs ? 
  you 'll get a custodian who 'll help you do that . 
  the state provides !, 
  it does n't always work the way it 's supposed to , but it 's pretty thorough and as long as ones knows how to handle one 's economy and is n't too averse to cutting back on some spending when one 's on the dole , one can actually get by just fine until one finds work . 
  lot 's of people manage this way . 
  hell , it how my own parent 's managed the family before dad got work ten years in ( they 're both immigrants ) . 
  it 's tough , sure , but not unfeasible . 
  makes one wonder why they 're any homeless people about at all , though i 've always assumed they were addicts who 'd exhausted their chances ( enlighten me if i 'm mistaken ) . 
  compared to other major cities like paris or budapest , or even k\u00f6ln or amiens , stockholm and malm\u00f6 have n't got many homeless people at all . 
  i rarely drink it , since i detest it , but when i do , i add a fifth of a mug of milk and three spoons/cubes of sugar to mask the taste . 
  most of my friends either drink it black or with some milk but no sugar . 
  i 've never really been able to like the coffee here , it 's watery and the taste feels hollow . 
  the best coffee i ever had ( and the only one i ever liked , for that matter ) i drank in romania . 
  had the best taste an aroma ever and , sadly , i have n't been able to find anything like it since . 
  same here . 
  i wonder if that does n't go for pretty much every modern country . 
  nice , i 'll be checking them out , thanks !, 
  i usually enjoy listening to folk metal for the most part too and only songs where they use their native tongues . 
  i know korpiklaani 's predecessor used to sing in saami and they have a few really good songs . 
  make the same sound you do when you 're blowing out candles and it should sound just right . 
  by sound , i like the saami languages the best . 
  i 've heard northern saami and i think it 's absolutely beatiful !, 
  wikipedia is your friend : [ malta ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malta ), 
  i have absolutely no idea why they chose to ban it . 
  personally , as somebody who do n't use nicotine , i appreciate it more when people take snuff than go smoking ( even though that does n't really bother me either ) , as it does n't create any smoke . 
  plus , they do n't have to leave the company to go outside and smoke every time . 
  if you happen to be in the southern parts of sweden : 1 . 
  simrishamn , stenshuvud , br\u00f6sarps backar ( all on the same road ) 5 . 
  han\u00f6 also , pretty much any deep forest in blekinge , sm\u00e5land or northern scania is wonderful during the summer . 
  that sounds really nice and i 'd love to try it !, 
  myself , i 'm from a small town in the deep south , blekinge to be specific , and i 've never seen it eaten here . 
  do you think it might be more of a northern thing ? 
  i mean , considering they call herring north of kalmas `` str\u00f6mming '' and the ones south of kalmar `` sill '' . 
  dad is a persian from iraq , so i get to eat quite a bit of persian and arabic cuisine when he cooks , while mom 's from hungary and she cooks a lot of hungarian dishes , though a lot of other ones too . 
  consequently , i 'm ethnically half-persian and half-hungarian , but personally i feel more swedish than anything else and i 'd say i 'm also culturally swedish , since i was born and raised here . 
  well , i would if i 'd ever eaten it , but i have n't . 
  come to think of it , i do n't think i know anybody who 's done so either . 
  it 's not something people eat , really , except for maybe certain celebrations and even then many omit because they simply do n't like it . 
  at least , that 's how i see it . 
  may also be that it 's not that popular where i live . 
  how would that be weird ? 
  as a swede , eating some meat dishes with jam and jelly . 
  the sweetness is not uncommonly found to be strange by outsiders . 
  as a hungarian , using sour cream in a lot of foods . 
  in this case , it 's the mild sourness that outsiders find strange . 
  as a middle easterner , the amount of sugar/syrup/sweeteners that go into whatever sweet stuff we eat . 
  outsiders seem to not like that a lot . 
  might be , though viewing jews unfavourably is one thing and putting those thoughts into action is another . 
  the fact that they 're viewed negatively throughout the muslim world is no news to me , my reasoning was simply based on the assumption that palestinians would be more likely to react aggressively considering that they 're actually part of the israeli-palestinian conflict , unlike the others who just see it from the sidelines , not to mention the experiences they likely might have had in palestine with israeli settlers and military . 
  again though , zerkish has already made it rather clear that this possibility is unlikely , so i withdraw my case . 
  it does and i hate it whenever it happens .

  i did n't mean it in the sense of actually being mentally challenged , just that they were murderous cunts . 
  but sure , they would be vulnerable , but then you would not give them the same freedom like the rest . 
  sure , but you do n't need to be extreme right to believe that a proper background check and declining people is a good thing . 
  you 're trying to compare very different things which makes your comparison awkwardly stupid . 
   why ? 
  because it 's illegal to smoke weed and if he 's a guest in the country he 's going to follow the rules just like everybody else . 
  i expect everyone to just switch sides soon . 
  sd being for gay rights and the left being against gay rights . 
   why would n't you want to be part of nato ? 
  political reasons . 
  we ca n't claim neutrality as easily and we 're expected to join military operations . 
  besides natos past is n't the brightest . 
   when you look at what happened in the ukraine do n't you feel there 's pretty much a nato line that the russians ca n't / wo n't cross and that you should be part of it ? 
  why do you think russia would even try to invade sweden ? 
  i disagree with the nato line . 
  if russia tried to invade sweden even if sweden is n't a part of nato , the member countries would still help . 
  it is . 
  they 're twisting the words for their agenda . 
  what makes you say that ? 
  so in conclusion , yes . 
   as long as it 's not intended to be a caricature of africans , then what is the problem ? 
  apparently some people got dibs on some colours because they 're included in their appearance . 
  as he said , criminals are criminal by choice . 
  they get criminal because they want to be feared , be respected and more money . 
  i doubt eu want to get involved with sweden 's stupidity . 
  business visas , to make it clear . 
  it 's being abused to the maximum and arbetsf\u00f6rmedlingen even supports it . 
  dumbest thing i 've heard this year . 
  the line is very arbitrary , but i would n't call someone fluent who does n't know what a spatula . 
  it 's a very basic word . 
  if you argue that vocabulary is irrelevent or of little importance of fluency then how would you define a fluent speaker ? 
  there is obviously a major difference between someone who can pronounce and know what a spatula is and someone who does n't know and ca n't . 
   do you have a source for your claim ? 
  except for my mates no . 
   i 've never met someone below the age of 60 who is n't fluent in english . 
  then you have n't met a lot of people . 
  i would n't even say that 15 % of swedes are fluent in english . 
  there are a lot of seemingly trivial words that we never learn in school or online for that matter . 
  if you go to usa or gb you 'll hear words you 're not familiar with at all . 
  there 's a big difference between proficient and fluent . 
  knowing how to say `` the shop is just down the street to your right '' is not the same as being conversational . 
  killing everyone to saving everyone . 
   so either they asked too many young people or we are boasting quite a lot probably a mix of both . 
  the swedish figure is highly oversaturated aswell . 
  there is actually an astonishing figure of youths who does n't speak english very well . 
  another thing is that english speakers are often more centralised in the bigger cities , which makes the map seem kind of wrong . 
  i 'd suspect that the further out on rural parts of the country , the less english speakers you have . 
  also , there is a big difference between between being able to speak and write english , some can write flawlessly but ca n't pronounce simple words . 
  field day in denmark ? 
  well ... 
  i feel sorry for the danes , it 's not their fault they 're born with a potato in their mouth . 
  we should liberate them from their evil curse , but then we 'll end up maybe understanding the danes ... 
  seeing as they have n't been able to communicate for centuries we do n't know what caveman technology they posess . 
  they might be discover fire soon enough , then maybe be able to build simple huts . 
  in a hundred years they might even discover maths . 
  italian style pizzas ( with thin crust ) generally suck . 
  i 'd take anything but the pizza . 
  there are different aspects . 
  at my martial arts school i train with military and the police force and sometimes they like to teach street self defence and techniques . 
  sure * some * schools may purely be for sports , but i 've talked with a few other guys and their respective schools have also some form of self-defence programme or classes . 
  no he said that `` martial arts are n't real '' . 
  that makes no sense , of course it 's real . 
  i am calling out on his bullshit that you can not defend yourself if you do not have a weapon , which you most certainly can . 
  you 're comparing apples to pears . 
  self defence and ability to escape a situation are completely different things . 
  there are situations where you simply can not escape and where self defence is needed . 
  it 's a last resort yes , but saying `` just run away/just walk away/just leave '' etc is just a gross simplification . 
   martial arts are n't real or effective forms of self defense . 
  why do you believe so ? 
   if anyone is curious , there is an older swedish spelling of kung , `` konung '' . 
  the `` o '' is pronounced like the `` ou '' in course !, 
  there is also `` knug '' . 
  sweden , norway , finland , drunkmark , same shit different name . 
  finally !, 
  well ... from a social perspective it is , but from a biological perspective humans are sexually mature enough to copulate at that age . 
  most of sweden is that cold if not colder . 
  -20 c is just a ~ ~ regular ~ ~ warm winter . 
  i like you . 
  what 's the difference between `` racist hate crime '' and `` hate crime '' ? 
  h\u00e5kan lans is a great example of people who have had his inventions stolen and then demanded to pay for the court costs etc. 
  the only reason why the companies ( compaq , dell and hp ) he sued won was because his attorney sued in the wrong name . 
  they sued in h\u00e5kan 's personal name instead of his company 's name ( which held the patent the companies infringed on ) . 
  was maybe . 
  currently i do believe it 's sweden when you count nominal . 
   well if we 're going to play that game , they 're also highly overrepresented in education , charity , and everything else . 
  i 'm going to need a source on your bullshit because according to what i 've read they are not at all , in fact they 're underrepresented in higher education . 
  it 's misleading if you contribute poverty to one of the root factors commiting violent crimes . 
  poor people generally commit more crimes because they have more free time . 
  there is n't a financial reason to why they commit more violent crimes . 
  you could just aswell point out that unemployed people commit more violent crimes . 
   what do you want to tell me with that ? 
  because people can usually relate to the `` white trash '' neighbourhoods and poor neighbourhoods in us that they 've seen on cops or whatever . 
   germany is not that very different from sweden i would wager . 
  it is very different . 
  while sweden has a tax rate of 31 % up to 60 % if you 're rich , german taxes goes from 14 % to 45 % . 
  the nominal tax rate in sweden is much higher and therefore we have more money to spend on eg . 
  support for the poor . 
   also even tho the poor people of sweden are less poor than poor americans , poor people just generally commit more crimes and pensioners generally commit less crime . 
  my point is that `` being poor '' in sweden is n't really being poor at all compared to other countries . 
  you have free healthcare , means of study etc while getting money from the government for housing , being unemployed etc.

  what 's so awful about being tolerant/helpful towards people in tough situations ? 
  why am i a horrible person ? 
  i 'll admit that the data i 'm standing on has looked at the total number of converts , over all religions . 
  so yes , it 's possible that the act of conversion is almost always a clear marker for increased terrorism risk , while still lowering the risk in some cases . 
  especially if it 's in regards to a religion where the number of converts is small , it might get hidden in the data . 
  you do n't have to be swedish to accept that a male-to-female transsexual is in fact ( and have always been ! ), 
  a woman , trapped in a man 's body . 
  you just have to be a non-asshole . 
  does n't it demonstrate the entire point of the film ? 
  it 's not bullshit , because someone who converts is generally extremely passionate about their new-found stuff , compared to people born in a religion who are generally `` meh '' about it . 
  it 's that passion that is dangerous , if it 's channelled into something destructive . 
  this is a simple statistical correlation , a fact , it 's not an opinion you can agree or disagree with . 
  concerning jainists , you ca n't assume that every religious person will be a textbook example . 
  if you do , you 'll be in for a nasty surprise . 
  religious people are irrational by their very nature , which makes it less predictable than how it looks in your fantasy world . 
  you 're trying to use logic to describe this jainist , which is laughable . 
  within every religion , including jainism , it will be possible to find people claiming to be a follower when they really are n't representative at all . 
  as i said , some religions ( such as islam ) are more likely to produce terrorists than others , but conversion itself is also a risk factor , and an even bigger one . 
  this means that if we take any christian , any muslim , and a newly-converted christian ; the new convert is the one who is the highest risk , followed by the muslim , followed by the regular christian . 
  ah , got it !, 
  there 's a pretty huge difference : nato is a defensive alliance , while russia is an offensive bully who likes to take shit from their neighbours . 
  nato has not , and will not , be the ones to instigate a conflict . 
  so no , russia is in fact not threatened by a nato that comes closer to russia 's borders . 
  it will , however , prove an obstacle to russia 's hopes of just doing whatever they like with their neighbours , so i can understand that they 're annoyed . 
  it 's such a bore to have to live by the laws like everyone else . 
  yes , russia did invade ukraine . 
  and they invaded georgia in 2008 . 
  this is simply facts , you can find the information anywhere . 
   yes religions give power to those who control the followers . 
  but when a father slices his son 's throat because he became an atheist , that 's not a political agenda . 
  it 's the result of a fucked up belief . 
  i kind of agree with both of you . 
  maybe we can conclude that the problem is n't * just * a political agenda , it 's both agenda and belief . 
  so we can set them up for acquiring even more fundamentalist views ? 
  i do n't know . 
  if they ever get out we might be in deep shit . 
  read his comment again , repeat until you understand it . 
  he said that the action of conversion itself is the highest risk factor . 
  which religion is ** also ** a risk factor , though a smaller one . 
  so yes , a muslim is more likely than a jainist to be a terrorist ( it 's a risk factor ) , but the guys to look out for are mainly the recent converts . 
  the first movie is about a girl though . 
  what 's the word for swede ? 
  it 's a huge difference between throwing a diplomat out and taking them captive . 
  in the latter case there can ( will ) be interrogations . 
  that 's the real reason that countries do n't arrest each other 's diplomats , and why it 's considered an enormous * faux pas * to do it . 
  if it was accepted , it would just be too easy to get your hands on secrets . 
  the only defence would be to only send diplomats who do n't know anything important about foreign policy and strategy , but then they could n't negotiate very well and there 'd be no point . 
   a child aged three to four , whose body bore traces of a violent death traces such as ... missing a head ? 
  it 's not a zero-sum game , trade favours both parties . 
  meaning that a british exit will hurt both eu and the uk financially . 
  not true . 
  the eu has a huge interest in not making it look like anyone can leave the union and still keep all the perks . 
  if that 's the image given , then half the countries might leave , which would be the end for eu . 
  so , it 's in the union 's interest to punish the uk as hard as possible every step of the way . 
  it 's a simple question of survival for the union . 
  no one has said that there will be no business done except the sound of crickets . 
  there 'll be * less * business . 
  how much of your income do you give to beggars ? 
  not so much ? 
  fuck what people want , right ? 
  donating stuff for free to the uk seems strange when they voluntarily leaves . 
  has n't he repeatedly said that even if his side loses he wo n't step down ? 
  probably because he wants the vote to be about the issue only , and not whether one likes cameron , but the reason is n't important . 
  he 's still the guy who 's going to negotiate the new deal . 
  i guess this is one of those `` luck of the irish '' things again ... 
  i just find that highly irrational . 
  it 's not as if you can avoid crime . 
  it 's possible to lower crime levels , yes , but this is a very silly way of doing it . 
  more funds to crime prevention would still be vastly cheaper , and give better results in terms of personal safety ( because more police resources would * also * prevent crimes committed by non-immigrants ) . 
  locking hundreds of thousands of mostly innocent people up is as stupid an idea as stupid ideas come . 
  the only purpose it serves is to prevent you from having to look at someone with a different skin tone , which is probably your main goal even though that 's not how you 're phrasing it . 
   it costs us far more to lock them up than it does to have a smaller percent commit a crime  * it costs us far more to lock them up than it does to have a smaller percent commit a crime *  ** it costs us far more to lock them up than it does to have a smaller percent commit a crime **, 
  i think it 's very rare to own a single gun . 
  either you do n't own guns , which most people wo n't , or you got like four or five . 
  the vast majority of gun owners are hunters , or sometimes members of shooting clubs , depending on the country 's culture . 
  a hunter is often not content to own a single gun ; he can have a few different rifles for game of different size , and a shotgun . 
  i 'm basing these statistics on my father , who hunts every once in a while , but i think he 's fairly representative of a regular guy who has hunting for his hobby . 
  how is it politically correct to blame a rape on the victim ... ? 
  that 's the polar opposite of political correctness . 
  so who 's going to decide , if not england ? 
  the situation we have right now is that everyone who is n't from an english-speaking country simply follow their lead , i do n't find that elitist . 
  we have decided to use * their * language , if we all agree to use something else we can . 
  exactly !, 
  i 'll always refuse to accept `` sometiems '' as correct spelling , for instance . 
   would you say it 'd reasonable if england was the only one to decide what english is correct ? 
  yes , actually . 
  very reasonable . 
  which gives every other nation/individual that speaks english a choice : either comply or go their own way . 
  if the latter is chosen enough times , it will eventually result in different languages . 
  there 's already a difference between american and british english . 
  as an english-speaking swede , i would consider it very strange if a voting ballot showed up in the mail asking my opinion on some change in the english language . 
  and if we take the path of representative democracy , i 'd consider it equally strange if my government was asked . 
  yeah , that 's what i hear from jewish friends as well . 
  it 's terrible . 
  taking an oath ? 
  how in the fuck do you reach the conclusion that i 'm a shill ? 
  i 'd really like to see your arguments here . 
  a guy said that latvia is really nice compared to sweden and has a low crime rate . 
  another one answered with facts : that while latvia might be nice , it has in fact three times as many murders as sweden . 
  some idiot responded by citing one ( 1 ) case of murder in sweden , as if that somehow makes it impossible that the murder rate in latvia is three times higher , his statement was completely * non sequitur .

  it is going to be a terrible experience . 
  china for example is going to make an example out of uk as to follow its '' one china policy/don ' t you dare to breaks up '' and it never going to sign a trade deal so everything need to go via eu regulations eg and usa is going to push uk to get back . 
  ( all of g7 nations was against uk for leaving ) smaller nations are not stupid so they are not going to rush for a trade deal as they know they 'll get a better deal waiting when uk is getting more desperate but all this experience is needed to get all that '' eu is a pain '' mentality away so when joining the bigger trade block in future you can get in on a better term for rest of eu and not be that 50/50 inout country as you use to be . 
  well said mate . 
  i feel more european as years goes by too . 
  i have notice myself identify me as '' i come from europe '' rather then saying '' i come from sweden '' and then when asked where in europe i 'll say sweden . 
  ( live in china ), 
  did i blame leave campaign only ? 
  cameron , the gov , the leave campaign and boris who was supposed to be next pm all had no plan . 
  have fun having bank of england start burning it 's currency reserves/have the pound free falling but at last the uk is now free from the big '' unorganized eu bureaucracy '' . 
  just give it to anyone it is not like [ boris ex london mayor care anyway ] ( https://twitter.com/ravisomaiya/status/747124898515017728 ), 
  lol this must be a 4chan joke . 
   i know many people here are too young for that , but watching 9/11 and the developments leading up to afghanistan and iraq felt similar . 
  thanks for making me feel old . 
  '' there was never a plan '' eh should you not have one if you call for a referendum ? 
  what the actual fuck ? 
  well it is a low tax country and not a tax heaven , even hong kong with 16,5 / 0 % tax is not regarded as a tax heaven but i get your point . 
  however ireland happen to be a populair country to set up eu business as it is a english speaking country and if uk is leaving eu that market would go nuts so expect scotland to have a good time taking uk 's investments eg . 
  the irish gdp are growing faster then china right now , why would scotland not have the same options like its small celtic neighbour ? 
  wow the conservatives would probably get away with that but would the ukip perhaps grow larger with more angry people ? 
  depends if they let scotland have their own referendum i guess ? 
  hey i got a deal here . 
  if she or that minitrump guy pull off the referendum can you guys then stop saying that eu is undemocratic ? 
  this should have been dealt with before the referendum . 
  but hey , a leave victory could never happen they said . 
  we had a referendum about it and could not get over 50 % so we are going to need to wait for another referendum . 
  hey ~ ~ minitrump ~ ~ boris the ref campaign is over now so you do n't have to lie anymore . 
  to be fair my country sweden have not adopted the euro yet even we easily could adopt it ( had a referendum but we pretty much said we would adopt it in 1995 ) but uk got way too greedy to have all the special things and it backfire hard with this referendum attempt to get away with more things . 
  you might even have to go back being a efta nation now . 
  remind me of sweden voting to join eu and to adopt euro in 1995 and then said '' yeah we get the euro at some point '' . 
   i am so disappointed by 51.9 % of the uk citizens people under 18 year did not vote and it had a overall turn out of 72 % so far from 51,9 % of all the uk citizens . 
  nigel farage be like : fcuk i now needs to do things like actually be present at eu meetings and act as a responsible politician lol . 
  you have my meatballz, 
  i think uk have another 2 year to go before leaving the eu so scotland can probably get away with staying without needing a veto if they chose to . 
  scotland leave 1,018,322 votes remain 1,661,191 votes [ source ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/politics/eu_referendum/results ) bbc, 
  so uk is going back to the european free trade association now ? 
  in adam lindin ljungkvist 's defence i 'll say that there where no [ singns ] ( https://funsubstance.com/uploads/original/41/41204.jpg ) to control the farting on the football field . 
  eddit . 
  happy mid sommer , 
  agree with you 100 % on that . 
  i said that the message is clear = in . 
  but it does not force reader as other '' doomsday '' headlines telling you directly to vote in their favour = smart headline by guardian . 
  the headline and not it 's content . 
  i do n't read guardian so i do n't know . 
  vodka drinking contest sounds like a bad idea , same as a sauna contest . 
  maybe they will unban if you lighten up the hard feelings with a joke ? 
  one finn and one russian went to compete for who can stay in a sauna for the longest time , the russian died . 
  the one guardian have will have high impact i think as the lights all around europe show how close we are together . 
  it also does not tell the reader what to do just that it is important to vote today so the reader do n't feel forced but the message is clear . 
  we got the world 's oldest central bank btw so it is not like we are doing a bad job at having our own currency . 
  how can the uk be against platyous sex toys ? 
  they need to have some fun too . 
  the big difference is that he said he did the attack randomly and did not know who she was just knew that she was a politician . 
  it was hard to see him more then some mental ill confused guy and had no correlation with the euro debate . 
  norway be like : thats cute . 
  [ for the republic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6ad-m7cw84 ), 
  well i was being funny with the boil in hell part ofc . 
   what if a student claims to be a pastafarian and has to whip up some noodles 3x a day to appease the flying spaghetti monster , would that be allowed ? 
  do n't talk about our lord the flying spaghetti monster like that !, 
  you 'll end up in spaghetti hell and boil for eternity . 
  eddit . 
  btw i was looking on the [ fsm website ] ( http://www.venganza.org/about/ ) and it says that their religion have a 30 day back guarantee so you can chose to go back to your old religion if you do n't like it and they have good things like stripper factories and beer volcanoes in their heaven !, 
  see this is why we ca n't have nice things . 
  it is not the size that matter but how well you can use you missiles , that is what she said . 
  alright i get it now , the 4 swedish airplanes were there to defend agains political incorrectness . 
  lol, 
  ok now i do n't get the joke , how is airplanes flying over blue sea and microaggression related ? 
  guess the joke is that sweden spend very little of its gdp on military . 
  eddit . 
  we still make it to the top 10 weapon exporter nations world wide somehow so we are not as innocent country as ` murica trying to make us sound like . 
  eddit2 . 
  the joke was probably about political correctness . 
  because of it might disrupt businesses , qatar is 100 % relying on foreign relations . 
  keep burning your coal you silly german . 
  why not build modern reactor so if the core melt it just trap inside a vault that you can keep closed for thousands of year if you wish . 
  it is way more dangerous to be afraid of building new reactor and still keep the old ones , do n't you think ? 
  green party had to do a logical decision , their feelings must hurt now . 
  it is getting to the point where people get real tired of the old propaganda just like people in america gets tired of the war on drugs eg . 
  lol it is not like we are a big producer of air . 
  if tropical countries did not share their air we would all be fucked :d, 
  we could build all the nuclear power plants in the north of sweden where no one live . 
  what is the point of building it in central europe ? 
  we have old mountains that wo n't have earthquakes and have no other nature disasters eg and if shit would blow up anyway the wind would fly into northern hemisphere killing like 50k people and some polar bears and that is worst chase scenario . 
  we also can use old mining tunnels to store all the nuclear waste or build new and better one deep under the mountains . 
  look at it as investing rather then sharing . 
  we make back the money spent on export and trade most likely . 
  picture your own country and how the richer urbanised areas such as copenhagen ends up spending money on roads on the country side eg . 
  is it a waste of money or is it helping businesses and ordinary people living in copenhagen ? 
  i was thinking of this new story when i read this one about qatar . 
  i am pretty sure she will let go after this news hit the headlines on big news sites . 
  your nationality make a big difference around the world sadly , imagine if she was from a 3rd world country eg . 
  george soros was against the erm too so he is not very eu friendly , he simply betts anywhere he can make money . 
  this made me think of when time did have a online poll and north korean leader the person of the year . 
  lol, 
  turkey in eu is very unlikely as long as any eu state vote no for them to join , do you think greeks by 2020 will vote them in by any chance ? 
  lol . 
  staying economic partner however is good for us and them even if turkey is being authoritarian for the moment . 
  why do amsterdam help funding roads somewhere on countryside ? 
  for same reason just on bigger scale . 
  monarch does not hold on to any power more then the immunity to parking tickets and such lol .

thanks , that means a lot !, 
  i 'd read that . 
   so you agree with me if you think so you should read my posts again . 
  i 've made my point rather clear ( that the underlying problem is one of bureucracy and xenophobia , and that a swede or norwegian would n't end up in the same situation ) . 
  frankly , i 'm bored with you now , and see no point in trying to make you see what you have decided you wo n't acknowledge . 
  you can lead a horse to water , et c. , et c. 
  there are qualifications in the sense of skills and experience , and in the sense of requirements . 
  it 's obvious that the man did n't meet the * requirements * , or he would have gotten a job , but he had the skills and experience needed to be very close to any reasonable requirements needed to fly a plane . 
  note that i did n't say he should join finland 's armed forces , i think he should do what most fighter pilots do when they do n't work for the air force anymore -- work as a pilot for a commercial , civilian airline !, 
  and that this is somehow * impossible * because he was born in somalia or wherever and not in finland , is completely unreasonable . 
  is it different types planes ? 
  yes , very , but it is common for military pilots the world over to seek jobs piloting commercial planes , so it ca n't be insurmountable switch . 
  are there different models of planes in finland and africa ? 
  very likely , but anyone who has worked as a pilot is able to fly more than one plane , and have of course tested more than one plane during training . 
  again , i 'm not saying that this man should just be able to jump in the cockpit in a minute , but it ca n't be so hard for him to work as a pilot in finland that he should have to scrub floors instead . 
  because that is , again , a waste . 
  we 're not talking about someone without qualifications . 
  we 're talking about someone who * is * qualified , but still ca n't make it due to a combination of prejudice towards foreigners and non-matching bureaucracy between different nations . 
  if not for those factors , it would be the easiest thing in the world to have a pilot from one country take a couple months crash course to polish up the skills and learn the differences in these new planes to be flown . 
  perhaps you do n't think it 's desirable , in that case i misunderstood you , i thought i picked up a distinct tone of * shadenfreude * in your writing . 
  in any case , what we have discussed is a symptom of a serious problem , which would n't require any impossible reforms to address , and your attitude of `` this should n't be fixed '' makes you part of the problem . 
  hence my irritation . 
  wow , such a stunning lack of self-perception in just one comment . 
  i 'm impressed by the hypocrisy . 
  yes , that was my point . 
  the way he phrased it seemed like he was actively happy about it , and that 's why he was disagreed with ( because he was , well , disagreeable ) . 
   if you ca n't get the job you want you get the job you can . 
  that 's how it is . 
  you do n't fucking say . 
  that 's not why you 're an idiot , you 're an idiot because you somehow find this a desireable outcome . 
  it 's an obvious waste , to everyone but you . 
  it may seem that way , but it has more to do with the fact that the refugees actually want to keep living where they settle down , and not have to move again in a couple of years . 
  sweden is the only country in the eu who has promised the refugees a permanent permit of residency , every other country issues temporary asylum permits which may be rescinded the second the civil war in syria is over . 
  i do n't think it 's strange that people want to have stability in their foreseeable future , and try to avoid living on `` borrowed land , '' so to speak . 
  it has nothing to do with germany or denmark being worse to live in than sweden , it 's all about the permits . 
  anyone telling you otherwise does n't understand their motivations at all . 
  but that reasoning is n't economically sound . 
  so we have a high rate of unemployment and therefore we do n't need more people ? 
  believing that the number of jobs is somehow fixed and that the number of people needs to accomodate that is backwards thinking , with that reasoning our whole economy would stagnate !, 
  jobs do n't appear by magic , they are created by people , and more people create more jobs . 
  the main problem with sweden 's economy has always been that we 're a pitifully small country ( population-wise ) , and that makes everything extremely inefficient . 
  are you deliberately missing the point because it 's more fun to attack a straw man , or are you just stupid ? 
  no one has ever said that it helps swedish economy more to accept syrian refugees rather than american engineers or whatever , * but * both types help the swedish economy since we 're a very small country and we need more people ( i ca n't speak for germany , since i know nothing about their economy ) . 
  the crucial difference between you and the syrian is that the syrian need our help , you do n't . 
  if you 'd like to move to europe you can apply for visas and whatever through the official channels , you 're in no hurry . 
  so the primary reasons to accept immigrants will always be humanitarian , but of course we could n't do it if it would destroy our economy , so it 's fortunate that our economy needs it ( in the long run that is , it will obviously mean slightly higher rates of unemployment in the short run ) , and those are secondary reasons . 
  you know , being poorer and having a harder time joining society ( by being helped to find a job , or other benefits ) does n't make people * less * radicalized ... 
  it 's always the groups on the socioeconomic edges of society that are prone to radicalization . 
  yes . 
  ah , time for a good ol' round of `` troll , shill or moron , '' / r/europe 's favourite game these days . 
  i 'm actually not sure where you belong . 
  nice paper you linked , it would have been hilarious if people had n't taken it seriously . 
  a quote :  the point is that now that the empirical facts are in and no longer a matter of serious controversy , i do n't even know where to begin . 
  what this author is doing is called * refuge in audacity * , he 's hoping that if he tells a lie big enough no-one will dare call him out on it . 
  you 're doing the same thing , by the way , when you try to convince me that muslims with automatic rifles control french cities . 
  as an aside , i 've lived my entire life in malm\u00f6 , sweden , another city which is run by dangerous immigrants who have scared away the cops -- if some newspapers are to be believed . 
  if you actually come here you 'll notice that it 's bullshit . 
  and even if you were right when you bring up these examples of failing assimilation , * it would n't matter * . 
  i do n't expect you to understand statistics or science , but this is what 's known as anecdotal evidence . 
  you 're trying to disprove a * trend * by finding someone for whom the trend does n't hold , and that 's not relevant because the trend only has to hold in general . 
  even if there were ghettos in malm\u00f6 were the police wo n't go -- and there are n't -- that would only mean that there are some exceptions where assimilation really does n't work . 
  those cases would be thrown in jail like any non-immigrant troublemaker , and that would be that . 
   might possibly ( speculation ) sue what ? 
  who 's done them wrong and under what law ? 
   there 's many loopholes that have to be sorted i whole-heartedly agree !, 
  the laws and practices should work , of course !, 
  but , i do n't think it 's a catastrophe either , in my experience these things have a way of working out . 
  taking care of the refugees would go * better * and smoother with better laws , but it 'll still go fine . 
  this is not the fall of western civilization . 
  also , laws are never perfect , they are just made better , and we 'll never achieve a perfect response to immigration anyway . 
   come to europe where they believe they 'll get everything for free . 
  i really do n't think anyone believes that . 
  the refugees thus far have been pretty smart about things , and surprisingly well educated too . 
   our kin should be our priority . 
  race and culture is important . 
  i actually agree that culture is important , though possibly not in the sense you mean it . 
  i think the general western culture of * secularism and openness * is very important , and that 's a good reason to accept immigrants . 
  i suspect you dislike the `` openness '' part , if your comment and username is any indication . 
  immigrants will , in time , see the value in this and conform ( over time i mean , their grandchildren will be perfectly assimilated members of society , and i can afford to take the long view since western civilization wo n't fall this month ) . 
  i 'll have to vehemently disagree with the rest of your shit though , i mean , who actually talks about race these days , outside of an rpg ? 
  it 's pretty clear to everyone that how you behave have everything to do with your upbringing and nothing to do with your genes . 
  you have good points , but i do n't think they 're very applicable here . 
  the leadership crisis , or perhaps it should be called a direction crisis , comes from the fact that the party has changed a lot in a short time , not much to do with power ( i 'll write more on that in my second paragraph ) . 
  the problem is that sd have moved from a rather unsavoury past ( white power and neo-nazism ) to an ideology which is more easy-going and accepted among the general public . 
  now , they have a youth organisation , and in the manner of youth organisations everywhere they are more radical than their mother party -- they 'd like to go back to the overtly racist roots , they have something of a ku klux klan atmosphere going . 
  now , the leadership of the mother party threatens to cut them loose completely , but this revealed a possible split in the party . 
  we 'll see how it works out . 
  the vast majority of their voters are mostly `` regular guys '' who just think the immigration issue could be handled better , while the core of the party -- the guys who do the work , who actually take up the various positions -- remember the good old days of white power and hating everyone who 's not blond . 
  there 's a conflict of interest there , and sooner or later they 'll have to do something about it . 
  sd and power then , the reason their current crisis is n't due to getting close to power . 
  in fact , they have practically no political power at all ( since every other party uniformly refuses to work with them , meaning that whatever they want to do in the riksdag/parliament dies ) , but their power is based on word of mouth , various scandals , various moves and gambits in the media , and so on . 
  they are firmly tied to the principle `` all pr is good pr , '' which was why i mentioned scandals . 
  one example was the * j\u00e4rnr\u00f6rsskandalen * , the `` iron bar scandal , '' where video footage of sd parliament members was leaked -- in the video some of the mps threatened immigrants with iron bars , intending to give them a beating . 
  now , most of the country denounced them and thought it was awful , but they got some more votes out of it !, 
  it seems that there are some people who actually think that the proper thing to do with immigrants is to beat them in the face with an iron bar , but they generally would n't dare to say this out loud . 
  then sd comes along and does it , and they gained some votes . 
  this is how sd 's power works , and that 's why i 'm sceptical that they 'll gain anything by figuring less in the media . 
  they have definitely not doubled in size out of nowhere . 
  true , but immigration seems to come in waves . 
  the current crisis with is wo n't continue in perpetuum .

  finland yes ? 
  that ottoman expansion and random moldovia migration curious to know what were the allegiances like here ? 
  were russia and ottomans gon na fight ? 
  on the holocaust/ww2 thing i think it 's because germans are pretty much taught to distance themselves as much as possible from ww2 germany in many germans ' minds that i 've talked to , `` modern germany '' pretty much began with the marshall plan and is a different society altogether from what was before, 
  fact : fertility is good for gdp growth you should be happy about it ( provided those kids are put into that sweet school system of yours ), 
  dat eu money, 
  we 've had a good run massively over-performing , pretty sure germany will overtake us next year though, 
  according to my current ironman teutonic knights eu4 playthrough , it 's all prussian, 
  i was n't saying everywhere else is perfect but i will say he felt it more in switzerland , especially when searching for housing/job and getting stopped by the police every other week, 
  wtf we were in switzerland for a year it is n't unreasonable to assume at least some of the people we interacted with were swiss, 
  i 'll be honest i did n't track down every person involved in these incidents and ask them if they were swiss born do n't think it matters much though, 
  why would i rewrite my own experience from the point of view of an imaginary white friend ? 
  also , even if it was so , why would it even matter ? 
  explain, 
  as someone who 's been in switzerland i can confirm it 's pretty good , if you have white skin ( last part is very important ) me and some friends , one of who was arab by background ( but swedish culturally and otherwise ) , had * very * different experiences in switzerland he would regularly get stopped by police and searched he had enormous problems finding housing ( very clearly because he did n't look like the rest of us ) job was out of the question ( we were exchange students some of us worked on weekends ) overall very different attitude from people if you are brown , would not recommend . 
  if you are white , pretty cool place . 
  greece did n't have an irs ? 
  not sure if troll, 
  surprised me too when i found out, 
  to white people the reaction is mostly positive , to english-speaking white people the reaction is even more positive , to anyone not white there seems to be a lot of racism, 
  regarding that eu referendum , [ the irony ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/82812000/jpg/_82812448_455481274.jpg ), 
  looking at previous years it seems to have gone from pretty strongly `` leave '' untill 2013 when it started swinging to `` stay '' new generation coming of voting age ? 
  or what changed, 
  lots of countries do n't have blasphemy laws, 
  freedom to roam a prison cell is not freedom , a fat person in a compression suit is still a fat person regardless if you actually want to blaspheme or insult people or not , the very fact that you * ca n't make the choice * makes whatever peace you have a hollow one, 
  no , the us is very much trying to enter partnerships with pretty much everyone including russia the fact that russia is impossible to be a partner with is not the fault of america, 
  yes , depending heavily on where you are from i did n't think this was an issue at all here for a very long time until i had a girlfriend from another part of the world turns out swedes are racist as fuck, 
  [ polls predicted about 34 % votes for conservatives ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/politics/poll-tracker ) [ conservatives got 37 % of votes ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/election/2015/results ) not perfect , but not very far off either why they have a majority of seats is due to your electoral system , but the accuracy of the poll was n't that bad regarding proportion of votes . 
  what the fuck this behavior should be punished not rewarded why ca n't we have a us-style system where you have to subscribe to certain core values before you are allowed in ? 
  have any polls at all suggested a referendum would end up in favor of leaving ? 
  pretty much yes, 
  well , shit . 
  what i find crazy is that belarus lost 1/4 of their whole population imagine every 4th person in a country just being dead , i do n't think even the black death had those % numbers, 
   anyway , the f-35 , it 's a good aircraft . 
  it could be a good aircraft , but we have the same plan for a fifth-generation aircraft , also . 
  of course , you are ahead in yours . 
  they 're both good , but they 're both in the testing phase . 
  that 's interesting considering how much criticism the f35 gets from the west, 
  tough *, 
  because we take moral responsibility and see an enormous humanitarian need in the world what does denmark contribute ? 
  driving up antibiotic resistance by stuffing it into pigs , good job retards . 
  just fyi disenfranchised is not the same as disillusioned disenfranchised sounds like someone is actively discouraging them from participating in the democratic process rather than them just being disappointed to the point they stop caring, 
  well invading a country is n't cheap and the money 's got ta come from somewhere if putin wants to maintain the nationalist fervor and become president for life, 
  can someone explain why danes have such low tolerance for brown people ? 
  the two population centres of stockholm , [ s\u00f6dermalm and norrmalm ] ( http://www.statistikomstockholm.se/images/statistik_pa_karta/befolkning%207%20%c3%a5ldersklasser.pdf ) both have interspersed [ 60s buildings ] ( http://www.ourtravelpics.com/stockholm/stockholm_220.jpg ) with old [ start-of-20th-century buildings ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/sweden._stockholm._norrmalm_020.jpg ) and the latter somehow always find a way to stop the former from being torn down and rebuilt or stop any kind of urban development at all for that matter case in point the central traffic hub slussen is in the middle of being rebuilt and people in some of the old buildings do n't want the new bus terminal to be * in the same mountain * as they are living on top of because `` fuck you '', 
  yeah soon you will join the rest of the [ zombie economy ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.kd.zg/countries/eu?display=graph ) sitting at around 0 % or negative growth, 
   danger of turning cities into historical disneylands stockholm suffers from this ** so much **, 
  the ceasefire was only advanced by putin because his supply line to the rebels was not strong enough to support the casualty rate of the rebels now that he has had time to funnel more troops and supplies , time to attack again . 
  they are militaristic and aggressive while holding nukes , that is not the same as having power they have pretty much zero allies and their economy is weak , they have the gdp per capita of a south american country if india started bullying nepal ( random example ) and threatening to use nukes if anyone interfered , no one would see it as them exercising their `` great power '' . 
  similarly with north korea , no matter how aggressive their foreign policy stance is it does nothing to improve their status as a great power, 
  it is a sovereign state , they are in no sphere of influence but their own, 
   they go above and beyond to prevent ukraine from joining the eu or nato why is this russia 's business ? 
  as someone who has been heavily using both the swiss and swedish train systems it 's interesting to see them rank so close when their challenges are so completely different in sweden it 's about connecting relatively long distances and having a nice density of trains at reasonable cost in switzerland it 's pretty much the opposite - very small distances but the challenge is to make the traffic run smooth overall i prefer the swiss railway, 
  this feels like a ridiculous ranking system seems like it 's just a `` corporate power index '', 
  china is actually pretty committed to security as it is a prerequisite for growth which in turn is the main thing keeping the power status quo in china atm would be cool if china could stop the russian mafia tactics in central asia , maybe open up a couple of pipelines from there, 
   uk had exact the same level in 2005 as it does in 2013 , and germany actually went up , from 18.4 % to 20.3 % . 
  probably because poor people in the east migrate west to look for jobs or better conditions kinda depressing to see romania/bulgaria still at  40 % , wonder what those countries must have been like before they joined the eu, 
   and their colonies pretty sure he covered iceland, 
  `` list of nordic noir shows currently on air '', 
  having been there and seeing how similar looking tallinn is to a random swedish town i 'd say they are nordic for those that doubt me : [ this ] ( http://cheapvacationholiday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/tallinn_how-to-get-there_9.jpg ) vs [ this ] ( http://www.spacescape.se/wp-content/uploads/sigtuna_450x300.jpg ) ca n't say i could personally tell the difference between estonia and sweden if i was placed in a random location of either country ( without looking at signs and stuff ) traditional clothing also is very similar, 
  somewhere a finn is boiling with rage right now, 
  it works for norway and switzerland i think the fear of `` everything goes to shit if you leave eu '' is way exaggerated that said i think the eu is at its core a worthwhile idea and we should work to fix it rather than throw it away, 
  because they share a number of socioeconomic problems as a group and are commonly referred to as immigrants because it is shorter than `` children of immigrants '' they also often refer to themselves as immigrants, 
  when we say `` immigrant student '' they are not really immigrants but rather sweden-born children to immigrants they grow up knowing only swedish or sometimes bilingual , the language is n't the problem, 
   the report blamed the system of school choice for the failure of almost half of children from immigrant backgrounds ( 48 % ) to make the grade in mathematics . 
  so their `` fix '' is to force good students from an immigrant heavy neighborhood into the masses of jackasses sitting in the back of the class with jackets on shouting shit at random instead of giving that student the option to go to a good school this can clearly only have a positive outcome  the report also recommends helping disadvantaged families make better school choices , so that their children , as well as those from middle-class families , apply to the country 's more popular , better performing schools . 
  sorry you are admitted on the basis of grades , a failing student will not get in to anything other than the immigrant heavy schools the problem is n't the schools themselves , it 's the students that are funneled into that school by the elective process, 
  yes the maidan was totally a western cia plot to secure gas pipelines, 
  commonwealth ii : the re-delugening ? 
  probably not much but i do n't think texans have the same aversion to camo as an average european so they probably consider it unnecessary, 
  texan police have increasingly desperate mexican drug cartels right across a notoriously permeable border as well as general access to very heavy weaponry for the public the idea of having to be on guard against an enemy might not be as inappropriate for them as it is in europe, 
  it was a submersible fishing boat , designed to fish the biggest fish which are obviously closer to the sea bed so you have to go under water to catch 'em, 
  the camo is secondary to the bullet proofing , they probably get surplus vests from the military so they can afford it on small scale budgets that 's why it has desert camo but tbh they are supposed to protect the public from potential ( and in this case realized ) violence it only makes sense that they have gear to protect themselves, 
  what are the main things the finns are sticking to ? 
  getting rid of swedish as official language ? 
  i was wincing at this point, 
  sign agreement to split up poland and allow hitler to invade france without worrying about eastern border -  did the most to win the war ? 
  bullshit the ussr might have had the highest casualties but they only `` won '' by being betrayed by hitler and forced on to the winning side . 
  they would have been happy to have germany be busy with the west while they purge and massacre finland poland and the rest of eastern europe it was a piece of shit regime right from day 1, 
   i did not argue that the eu would have the largest economy or run the world as an empire . 
  instead i claimed that the eu offers a good life in an interdependent world and that its core operating principles would spread until they became the world 's . 
  contrary to popular perception and a lot of careless news reporting , embassies are the sovereign territory of the country in which they are located , not of the country whose diplomatic mission is housed there . 
  that is why an office building can host an embassy on some floors and , say , a bank on others . 
  the reason for the misperception is probably that the vienna convention states that the local government foreswears the right to enter an embassy , and diplomatic immunity protects the diplomats working inside . 
  however , this does not mean that that space is somehow transmuted into the embassy nation 's soil or legal territory for purposes of law enforcement . 
  imagine , if a person should enter the british embassy in china and kill someone , who do you think will arrest him ? 
  correct answer : the chinese police . 
  they can not enter the embassy without the ambassador 's permission , but with that permission they will go in , take away the miscreant , and then try him in chinese court under chinese law . 
  or else the embassies security officers will deliver him to them outside the embassy gate . 
  imagine , if you can , the utter nonsense of the fellow being hustled onto an airplane and flown to london for trial . 
  you do n't have a flair but unless you live in norway , sweden is still a better place to live than your country so what is your country doing wrong that sweden with all our immigrants are still doing better than you ? 
  media is always raving about the `` fitness madness '' and how we are too obsessed with being fit so i 'm gon na say it 's very important, 
   could be , i was just ~ ~ speculating ~ ~ * assuming * ,, 
  success breeds jealousy, 
  there was that one period when they had a very efficient propaganda machine to promote a certain ideal i forget who the man behind it was i think it was josef gobblers or something, 
  yeah we are on the verge of sending people to gulags in sweden / s good chat, 
  i 'm happy to have a parliament full of politically correct people rather than have a parliament full of pedophiles there are worse things than political correctness also , we have plenty of open discussions about immigration which is why we are able to identify the racists as being racists in the first place . 
  for example , given the choice between either an idealized full integration of immigrants to the point where there is no socioeconomic differences or sending them back to where they ( or their parents in many cases ) came from , they openly choose the latter . 
  this is racism without question ( note that this means they want to send people with no other citizenship than swedish over to iraq or iran and cancel their swedish citizenship , based on the fact their parents have iraqi/irani passports ), 
   `` oh no , a black dude walking towards me ?

  but i believe you ; i was probably mistaken with local data . 
  in japan manual transmissions are rare , down into the low single percentage . 
  and as the home market is big and important for most japanese manufacturers ( and the big us market is also majority at ) their sales would show mostly at . 
  one bit of confusion seems to exist though : some people seem to count paddle shifters as manual transmission . 
  they are n't , of course , not technically ( expecially for cvt ) and not legally either . 
  even without electric cars , the manual transmissions days are numbered . 
  manual sales are a small fraction of automatics now , and many makers are removing manual options completely for most of their models . 
  even if it 's somebody i loathe , i do n't accept any speculation like this without some form of tangible evidence . 
  neither should you , or anybody . 
  `` it all fits ! '', 
  is not evidence . 
  i 'm no fan of erdogan or the descent of turkey into religious oppression .

  no more cherry-picking . 
  makes me feel we can make this european idea work after all . 
  i read you as denying she is corrupt . 
  and as evidence for your position you assert that other people in her social class are more corrupt than her . 
  but that does n't falsify the original statement in any way . 
  `` par for the course '' just means she is corrupt , and other people are also corrupt . 
  `` everybody else is doing it '' is not an excuse . 
  it 's the opposite : `` i know it 's wrong , but i can hide behind others '' . 
  she really , truly is only vaguely acceptable because the alternative is trump . 
  what , no blood ?

   any job for cardiovascular scientists ? 
  oh , another bleeding-heart immigrant story ... 
  japanese do the same thing . 
  it is , i realized , meant both as a compliment and as a way to encourage you . 
  it 's when people _ stop _ complimenting you for your language , that you 're actually becoming good . 
  and when natives start gently chiding you for grammar errors or awkward turns of phrase , you know you 're good enough that people expect you to get it right . 
  i 'm pretty sure when a second family built a farm next door to the first farm in human history , people complained about noise , price rises and how the genuine atmosphere was completely destroyed by all the newcomers . 
  it 's a kebab with pasta ? 
  interesting idea !, 
  anywhere we go in the world , we like to walk around cities . 
  we rarely bother with any castles , famous sights or anything like that ; we walk around , eat local food and drink , talk with people , soak up the atmosphere . 
  germany is great for that . 
  many cities are a fun mix of beautiful older areas and busy modern streets . 
  berlin of course , but d\u00fcsseldorf ( ahh , altbier ... ) , hamburg , m\u00fcnchen and so on are all fun to just spend a few days in . 
  other european favourites include prague , amsterdam , and - until last year - istanbul ( the religious hysteria and terror put us off ) . 
  been to paris twice but did n't enjoy it . 
  maybe a case of too-high expectations . 
  stockholm and copenhagen suffers from being too familiar to me ; other people may find them more agreeable . 
   who is to blame here are almost exclusively politicians . 
  it 's not politicians that harass their neighbours , it 's ordinary people . 
  and it 's ordinary people that respond to those politicians by voting for them in large numbers . 
  politicians and media can only fan a sentiment that is already there . 
  you need large number of perfectly ordinary , upstanding regular members of society to be bigoted racists for any of that demagoguery to work in the first place . 
  in a way , saying `` oh , it 's not us . 
  it 's those politicians/journalists/media moguls fault . 
  it 's not we , it 's _ them . _ '' is the same kind of mistake as blaming foreigners , muslims , jews , gypsies or belgians for anything that is wrong . 
  it 's abdicating responsibility . 
  we need to face up to the fact that a lot of our friends , coworkers , relatives and neighbours are bigoted assholes . 
  if there 's research money and an open environment to work in , then i do n't see why not . 
  rural people in general do n't like anybody that does n't sound or look like themselves . 
  with the majority of people living in cities today , it 's easy to forget or ignore just how arch-conservative rural areas often are . 
  sometimes i wonder if a lot of xenophobia is n't simply an exposure effect . 
  you dislike things you 're not used to in your daily life . 
  would explain why rural populations - that experience fewer things in general - are more conservative ; and why , in the brexit vote , some of the areas with the fewest foreigners were most likely to vote leave . 
  i think the point is that a few of `` the rules we signed for back in the treaty of rome '' have proved to be contraproductive fifty years later . 
  yes , moving thousands of people to strasbourg then back home every month is according to the rules . 
  but nobody thinks it makes any kind of sense any longer , the french included . 
  it 's just a giant economic and environmental sinkhole we throw stuff into every month , with no reason . 
  you missed the part of greece also becoming more like sweden in return . 
  we lost one of the top countries by size from a local intra-party power play that got far out of hand . 
  the vote was mainly about local politics , and about the local representatives for the two sides , not about the eu . 
  you know , i hear a lot about the polish people coming to britain and how everybody hates them for that . 
  but you also get swedes , danes and finns , and nobody says a bad word about them . 
  but they 're largely white , northern europeans from eu countries - just like the poles , and from a place only kilometers away . 
  the only difference between swedes in london and poles in london is , in fact , that the swedes tend to have money . 
  so the inescapable conclusion is that you do n't like swedes , or danes , or anybody else either . 
  you do like the _ money _ they bring , however , and in the interest of money you 're prepared to overlook the foreigner that comes attached to it . 
  the past few months have really clarified the attitude of britain towards other people a lot . 
  not necessarily to the benefit of gb , of course . 
  afaik , the strongest proponents of stopping the move and just pick a place already is the parliamentary members and other officials . 
  they apparently hate the hassle as much as we do . 
  as i understand , they 've even had to instate rules forcing people to actually go to strasbourg in person rather than work remotely . 
  i wish france would act grown-up about this and accept a permanent brussels location . 
  yes , some of the symbolic half-measures such as the divided parliament should be removed . 
  it 'd be a nice sign that the members are able to grow up a little and not bicker about that kind of thing . 
  let the parliament sit in brussels . 
  and yes , i think a major issue is just how much misinformation and outright lies are floating around about the eu in the member states . 
  the problem is , just another information campaign is n't going to change that . 
  what to do better ? 
  i do n't know . 
  a third thing is the half-assed integration in general . 
  i do n't know how feasible it is , but the eu members should probably decide to go all-in or all-out on a lot of areas , rather than trying to hack together an unstable compromise . 
  anything related to the euro should probably be all-in , for instance -- which would mean euro bonds and more transfers from richer members to poorer ; but also common rules on taxation , salaries and so on . 
  yes , painful . 
  and yes , expensive . 
  but in the end an economically stronger eu across the union , and -- very important -- economically stronger eu citizens across the union , not just in the wealthiest countries . 
  germany and greece may both have to sacrifice a small part of what they are , and become just a little more like each other . 
  and both will eventually be better for it .

  snorri is one of * the * most important individuals in how we percieve and know norse mythology and history , with some of his political influence having consequences reaching far into the future .

  counter strike . 
  sweden is the top earner in professional counter strike * by far * , both for cs and cs : go .

  got curious what google meant , so did a search for it ... loads of old articles about how awesome the pre-euro currency in latvia was . 
  as a swede googling `` why is sweden '' , top three suggestions are : ... so bad ? 
  ... so good ? 
  ... so good at cs ? 
  i assume it 's affected by me watching e-sports , to some degree ? 
  or do other swedes also get the cs one when searching ? 
  aw , if it makes you feel any better swedish google suggests `` why is latvia ... n currency so strong '' when i check it . 
  ( followed by `` so poor '' , `` population declining '' and `` famous '' ), 
  wrote `` why is montenegro '' into google here in sweden , really did not come with any suggestions . 
  huh . 
  if i actually search for that , however , it 's mostly people wondering about the name it seems ... which can be found out easily by just checking the wiki page . 
  sweden in general has very strict construction laws when it comes to building height . 
  uppsala ( 4th largest city ) for example has a law saying newly constructed city core buildings can not reach above the base of the castle ( located on a ridge , to ensure that the castle and cathedral dominates the skyline . 
  i think it 's basically only l and maybe sd that wants to increase the budget for the military , no ? 
  yeah , but i never said it was popular either . 
  just that stuff like that is being said , serious/popular or not . 
  ah yes , the classic `` i never met anyone who said that therefore no one ever will '' . 
  ah sorry , thought i included the source : https://www.reddit.com/r/shitamericanssay/comments/515fyh/why_apple_shouldnt_pay_eu_tax_we_saved_their_ass/, 
  ha , already being said a lot . 
  also , regarding apple being forced to pay eu taxes :  we saved their ass twice . 
  europe would be speaking german right now . 
  ireland is a usa 's satellite state and has no right to interfere in our business . 
  the uk are the only ones actively working against it * while leaving the union * . 
   the punish britain crowd and you 're just as misinformed as anyone else claiming britain is being `` punished '' simply because they wo n't get all the benefits of eu without having to also accept the responsibilities . 
  fun fact : the distance between moscow and venice is about the same as the length of the us-mexican border . 
  i should mention that a lot of people were angered by these rulings , but no one has really followed up and tried to change it . 
  the debate that has dominated lately is rather about gender divisions in open times at various bath houses . 
  it has become increasingly common for bath houses to have women-only times , which many see as a symptom of a larger problem . 
  irrelevant . 
  to some people , a pasta strainer on the head is a religious marking . 
  that does n't mean that every kid putting one on their head as a makeshift knight armor is suddenly in pastafarian attire . 
  context , intent ( and in most cases design ) matters . 
   what i find most disturbing in these cases are the self-entitlement and lack of willingness to accommodate the society they immigrated to . 
  there 's been at least three cases here in sweden with immigrants not being given internships at town halls because they refuse to shake hands with people of the opposite sex due to `` religion '' . 
  in all three cases , they were awarded damages of 10-30ksek ( 1-3k euro ) in court . 
  in at least one of the cases , the woman responsible for hiring interns was fired for racism . 
  in one of the cases , the man said it was fine if he could just wash his hands after touching a woman . 
  he was told that was ok , but that he still had to do the handshakes since it was part of the job ( and our culture ) . 
  he declined anyways and was awarded 20ksek in damages . 
  of course people are not going to accomodate to the society they immigrate to if they are rewarded for * not * doing it . 
  so `` no '' . 
  most companies would need to hire more people . 
  would you cut down on school time as much as well , or would the schools also have to hire more ? 
  yeah ... the last time the hours/day in sweden was lowered was around 100 years ago . 
  from 16 hours to 8 hours , since there was industrialisation going on that made that possible . 
  back in 1971 , 5 day work weeks were agreed upon . 
  from what i understand , this was partially thanks to computers improving efficiency . 
  i 'm not saying it 'll never work or that it wo n't happen , but i do not believe that we currently have enough technological progress for it to be economically feasible for a large amount of companies . 
  to claim that it would have no negative effects * at all * for anyone , like many supporters here at least do , is absolutely idiotic . 
  the costs may be acceptable in ... 20-30 years , maybe ? 
  you mean `` where do * these parties * think money comes from '' . 
  most people understand that this would not work . 
  those in favor of this claim that productivity would rise by at least enough to cover the cost when people get more free time , however ... in * all * professions . 
  when the former social democratic leader mona sahlin was trying to get votes , she promised a law that would make everyone working part time entitled to getting a full time position within the company they were working at . 
  she literally claimed that the work required for everyone suddenly going full time `` would appear '' if they did that , and that any problems would be `` fixed by the companies '' . 
  possibly the thinking behind this is similar . 
  there 's a classic ( as in often reposted ) newspaper clipping from a few years back with a woman answering the question `` do you care if the wares you buy are produced by children ? '', 
   yes , children has no sense of quality , and it 's noticeable on the end product . 
  now , i 'm * pretty * sure she was joking , but ... [ link ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_jdnef8gte8o/sel82z194zi/aaaaaaaaagk/aq9s_pzysla/s400/aaa%2520%2811%29%5b1%5d.jpg ) in swedish . 
  most of the left wing parties * do * wan na put in 6h work days with the same pay as 8h work days , saying it wo n't affect the companies negatively , though . 
  it 's like there 's more than one person living in sweden !, 
  wow !, 
  imagine that !, 
  and i am not comparing `` across countries '' and never was . 
  * you 're * the one who keeps changing the focus in some weird attempt to prove yourself right . 
  victim surveys are generally used to determine what the `` real '' rate may be and thus how many crimes go unreported . 
  those have shown no increase at all . 
  also , sweden does n't really record ethnicity statistics like that . 
  everyone i met in berlin was super nice and friendly , actually !, 
  of course , many of them were also drunk , but still . 
  maybe the drownings are from people setting themselves on fire and then getting knocked out when jumping in the lake to stop burning . 
  yeah but c'mon , you ca n't hold what * wallstr\u00f6m * says against us !, 
  she just does n't know better . 
  nah , official statistics show that india only have 2 rapes per 100k people while sweden has 66 per 100k , so obviously india has among the * lowest * rates in the world . 
  most of the `` sources '' i see people link when claiming stuff like that is anti-immigrant/islam blogs . 
  often using * very * outdated data . 
  you mean the amount of * reported * rapes has increased . 
  i 've yet to see a victim survey that shows that the * actual * amount of rapes has increased , rather than just the willingness to report them . 
  that 's completely and utterly wrong , but a fairly common claim from people online who in reality have no idea what they 're talking about . 
  it 's not really that similar , and the way statistics are collected is vastly different in a way that seriously inflates the swedish statistics compared to the norweigian ones . 
  the rate is * not * increasing . 
  the rate of * reported * instances is , but not the rate of it actually happening ( according to independent surveys ) . 
  most statistics that show an increase also fail to take into consideration that the increase may be due to a changed law ( like the huge bump in 2005 , which is due to the law having been changed in late 2004 and thus showing an increase of 400 % which is really just because it counted only 2-3 months in 2004 and the whole year 2005 ) . 
  yeah , that text basically says if you slept with someone who did n't fight back because they were blacked out drunk or too scared to move you can still get convicted for rape . 
  so no , it does n't say what you claim . 
  it says that the person would have to be so drunk she ca n't say no or struggle ... at which point it should already be obvious that you should * not * be having sex with the person . 
  swedish statistics count every instance as a separate crime , while other countries do not . 
  if the same woman is raped 20 times by the same man , it would count as 20 rapes in swedish statistics and 1 in other countries . 
  for dan eliasson it 's more than `` some scandals '' , though ... he was given the position basically because he hates the nationalist party and has a history of covering things up from earlier jobs . 
  under his `` leadership '' , they have become completely inable to actually do any preventive police work . 
  loads of police are openly protesting his actions , like the `` do n't molest me '' - bracelets in response to sexual crimes or his political statements and clear lack of political neutrality . 
  also , all crimes involving an immigrant ( as victim , perp , witness or whatever ) were blanket classified until media started questioning the legality of that . 
  descriptions of criminals are no longer being released at all since a few weeks , since they `` may be considered racist '' . 
  it 's less a scandal and more a complete and utter disaster . 
  i would imagine trust for individual police is high , while trust in the police management/leadership is extremely low .

i love folk tales and lore !, 
  i live in a pretty isolated small village in sweden , surrounded by forests , lakes and mountains so it was a cool place to grow up in , many people in this area , ( pretty much the old people ) often believe in different creatures and told stories about them , i remember a old lady telling a group of kids that she had met `` gruvfrun '' / which is a being who lives in the mountain , in mines and guards it and sometimes punish miners if they are rude and disrespect the mine , if you show respect she can help people find stuff and show lost miners out of the mine . 
  the same goes with other scandinavian folk lore creatures , mostly it is about respecting the nature, 
  the politicians yes , the average swede , nope . 
  and of course the attitude are not the same all over the country , and sd ( the political party whose main focus is to reduce immigration seems to be bigger than ever now , just as i said , there are over 9 million people here , we are not a huge hivemind , some are political correct , some are not , some dont care . 
  most swedes i see on the internet for an example tend to be anti immigration, 
  from what i heard sd is now bigger than ever becouse of the migrant crisis, 
  thank you !, 
  finally someone who can think for themself instead of just listening to biased articles . 
  its hilarious to read what some people here think of sweden, 
  nothing is wrong with swedish people , dont judge a entire land and its people based on retarded news you hear, 
  they should move on to russia, 
  i like cold and boring, 
  same on the swedish, 
  sweden , norway , denmark , iceland, 
  send them to russia, 
  fuck you, 
  hey denmark !, 
  we help you get norway and you help us get finland ? 
  sk\u00e5l !, 
  its really common in all of europe , if any swede would believe in a conspiracy its probably this, 
  we believe the same thing but we believe its run by the danes, 
  you are being overdramatic , and its funny that people believe you , i do agree that we have a problem with political correctness and media being crazy , but you talk like its a fact and entire sweden is like this, 
  you dont know how sweden works do you ? 
  everything is so simple right ? 
  thats just them and not all swedes . 
  also it depends from where you are from in sweden i live up north and i rarely see these problems bur yeah im aware of it . 
  and then we have alot of overdramatic people like on internet who get this image of sweden and swedes of internet, 
  it is what everyone on reddit and internet does . 
  som dont even read the article and just the title, 
  putin is kinda gay, 
  thank you . 
  excellent post !, 
  i always get annoyed with all butthurt americans crying how they fear america will become like sweden !, 
  but guess what . 
  we fear that we have become more and more like you . 
  yes thats right . 
  i am tired of this circlejerk and overpatriotic things . 
  as much problems sweden has i am still glad i live in sweden over america . 
  and yes i think its safer , at least where i live . 
  you judge us based by attacks and ghettos do you know what ? 
  we do exactly the same thing as you and i am sick of sweden being more americanified especially when american stuff does not work well here . 
  it does not even work well in america, 
  how dare you say that !, 
  america is perfect in every way and is nothing like the multicultural warzone that is europe !!!!!!, 
  i am so glad america is a safe place without corrupt politicians and media / s, 
  nothing annoys me as americans who wants to be better no matter what , even if facts are throw into their faces . 
  you know what we say here ? 
  we say oh crap sweden is becoming more like america or at least we are not america yet . 
  sweden is still a safe country compared to america . 
  how suprising youtube comments being toxic and ignorant, 
  why ? 
  i think its awesome to learn more especially scandinavian languages . 
  what ? 
  havent heard about this . 
  source ? 
  i know we have changed and will change alot but not to sure about that, 
  fuck you dude . 
  and you know sweden has changed the last couple of months and will change in the coming months ? 
  only stupid people think that, 
  recent polls show that the support of current government is lower then ever and i see a change in the government happening . 
  and sweden has changed the last couple of months and will keep changing . 
  the politicians today do not listen to the people what we the swedes want . 
  and you act as sweden is in a civil war . 
  stop live in your internet created fantasy . 
  and i have no involvement in shitty stuff happening . 
  i havent even been able to vote yet . 
  i love our north germanic languages yes even you danish . 
  you have your charm !, 
  even if i have a hard time to understand danish i try my best when i speak to danes . 
  well as a northern swede i at least have a hard time to understand you while others on scania may understand you and even know how to speak danish . 
  norwegian got to be the non swedish language i love and understand the most . 
  like us swedes they have alot of funny accents some may be harder to understand then the other but still understand most of norwegian . 
  to be honest i wish all scandinavians should speak norwegian and then we have the epic language icelandic !, 
  which is pretty close to the language our forefathers spoke . 
  it sound both beautiful and epic and i hope to learn it one day . 
  it is funny how i as a scandinavian can understand many phrases icelanders use . 
  i think its really cool they kept that language . 
  we have some accents in sweden that could pretty much be considered their own language like the elfdalian . 
  and then we have faroese language . 
  its really cool and it sound like some swedefied/norwegian icelandic . 
  and g\u00f8tdansk is awesome as well * ( you danes should speak g\u00f8tdansk instead hehe ), 
  if you only listens to shit posts on the internet and media yeah sure it sound horrible . 
  but am entire country and its people should not be judged by the media . 
  if you do that you are really ignorant . 
  sweden has its problems but i rather live here then anywhere else in the world . 
  would move to norway or denmark if i had too . 
  we still in my opinions are one of the greatest and safest country for now . 
  you are being overdramatic and probably are brainwashed by the media, 
  now you know how it feels to be a swede on the internet . 
  everywhere you go you are followed by retarded memes, 
  lol swedish sound weird?and you are talking about finns . 
  please . 
  is that supposed to be funny ? 
  sweden is not popular to like these days . 
  i still think much of the stuff about sweden is either rmisleading or overdramatic . 
  we have problems but its still a great country . 
  people judge too easily , i dont judge whole america because of its ghettos and shit . 
  you should build a wall on the russian border instead . 
  no reason to ignore sweden .

  moreover , it was covered by western media as well , as i remember reading about it in both english and german language papers when the matter was still fresh . 
  concering hlinka , that 's deplorable . 
  though to me that seems very similar to how seemingly many people seem to like the fascist horthy in hungary . 
  from what i can gather , the entire eastern half of europe seems caught up in lauding fascists from the past . 
   if someone is beaten at school , it ought to be reported to the staff so that the bullies can be appropriately reprimanded . 
  hell , it is the very duty of any school to take a stand against and combat bullying and violence on its premises , just like in any other civilized society . 
  when a disagreement deteriorates to the point of a fistfight , then it 's a problem that needs to be dealt with , no exceptions . 
  it 's not about asking others to fight our battle , but about doing away with violence by combating the backward macho mentality that gives rise to such things in the first place . 
  schools , as public places , need to prevent any sort of fighting , lest it only encourages bullies to carry on with what they do . 
  i 'd say that putting all media outlets under the supervision of a state controlled body , firing half of all their employees and reshuffling the rest , making sure to put sympathizers of the ruling party in their places sounds pretty authoritarian . 
  not to mention how the first thing they did was fire everybody working in administration not sympathizing with the party and replace them with party sympathizers . 
  then all the whole rewriting of the constitution , introducing a bunch of nationalistic hogwash referencing god ( pretty much took away secularism there ) , most plausibly also giving themselves advantages for the next elections . 
  then the whole pointless handing out of citizenship to hungarian outside the borders , who will thus receive all the privileges of citizenship without having to pay any tax for it , and considering that most of those who apply for it ( transylvanians ) are conservative , it 's an obvious move by fidesz to increase their voter base with people who * do n't even live in the country * . 
  not to mention it served nothing else but pissing off slovakia , even when they 'd finally gotten rid of fico . 
  essentially everything fidesz has done since they were elected has been concentrated on accumulating more political power and securing it . 
  and whatever do you mean by `` rightfully hated '' ? 
  if someone is beaten at school , it ought to be reported to the staff so that the bullies can be appropriately reprimanded . 
  hell , it is the very duty of any school to take a stand against and combat bullying and violence on its premises , just like in any other civilized society . 
  transparency , and lots of it . 
  if we want a federal europe to work on any level , it must be transparent enough to make politicians think thrice ( yes , thrice ) before they 'd engage any sort of embezzlement , abuse of power , nepotism or any other form of corruption . 
  let all official documents and activities be readily accessible to the common citizen and let all activities pursued and/or performed by public figures and authorities be open to public scrutiny . 
  with such provisions in place , keeping our politicians in check will be done by investigative journalists and media , who 'd be able to make big news of any eventual corruption scandal , thereby saving us the money , time and effort of having to keep track of them ourselves . 
  i want to see a well-staffed , well-run , competent audit office that would scrutinize government activity and policy down to every little detail . 
  i want minorities and their languages to be adequately protected from persecution and any potential attempts at tyranny of the majority , see them granted them a certain degree of autonomy and have federal programs set up to preserve their language and culture . 
  i want human and political rights to be there for every person , regardless of shape , composition or mental structure , and to have every person 's rights be declared inviolable and above any form of belief , be it ideology , religion or opinion . 
  that 's the least i 'd like to see in a european constitution . 
  while i agree that regarding the constitution to be infallible is stupid , demanding recurring rewrites just makes for an unstable political system imo . 
  if a party has a large majority , or perhaps even an absolute majority , then things could start going downhill pretty fast . 
  just look at what 's happening in hungary . 
  generally , the constitution is there to cement the core laws of a country , like human rights and form of government , everything else belongs among the regular laws . 
  i believe that should a european state get a good democratic system in place , then such issues will get sorted out by themselves . 
  i 'd rather advocate tighter controls on the constitution to make it harder to change , so that it may only be changed when it has wide support and is not subject to political fluctuations . 
  sweden has a good system wherein changing the constitution requires first for the proposed change to pass a vote in parliament , then wait till after the next election for it to pass a second vote , whereafter it has to be approved by the monarch ( which always happens ) . 
  i 'd like to see a similar system for a united europe , but with a popular nationwide referendum to confirm it rather than having a head-of-state do it . 
  well , true . 
  i think these two things is what crushed my hitherto positive naivety about the eu . 
  at first it all looked so idealistic , now it just looks like a well-intentioned but miserable bag of fail . 
  yeah , i know . 
  still sad that there 's nothing to bar governments from watering down their countries ' democratic institutions and circumventing laws that would otherwise prevent abuse of power . 
  dunno , perhaps from an economic perspective , though his rather authoritarian policies do n't seem like they 'll change anytime soon . 
  that 's exactly how i feel about native american languages : confusing but certainly impressive . 
  it seems to vary depending on age group . 
  most adults i 've spoken with have been rather positively inclined towards the eu , as have most politically involved people in my own age group been ( which have mostly been moderates and social democrats ) . 
  the most vocal eu objectors i 've noticed are nationalists and socialists , as well as young adults who 're politically interested . 
  the anti-euro sentiments seem to be based on perceived lack of transparency within the eu and the so-called `` democratic deficit '' , which here refers to the inability to directly elect our own representatives and influence the eu in general . 
  nationalists complain about the eu robbing the country of its sovereignty , while socialists complain that the trade barriers are detrimental to the developing countries and thus unsolidaristic . 
  the pro-eu opinion seems to boil down to the basic idea of the eu acting as a stabilizing force that through commerce and political harmonization creates stability and prevents wars by making all member states interdependent . 
  the eu 's whole raison d'\u00eatre is , according to this viewpoint , to keep the countries of europe from trying to tear each other apart , and many eu supporters seem to think that without the eu , europe would revert back to the interbellum . 
  while that does make sense , from what i 've noticed ( at least in hungary ) , english is virtually unknown outside budapest , and even there few people speak it . 
  the most spoken second language is by far german , which also seems to go for the rest of the vi\u0161egrad group , while in second place you 'll find italian , except for budapest where it comes third after english . 
  romania , based on last time i was there , still seemed to favour french , plus i 'd guess slovenia and croatia might favour italian due to their proximity to the country . 
  also , the french do n't seem to be all too fond of english either . 
  and i 've already heard sentiments about perceived ango-saxon cultural imperialism , mostly intended at the prevalence of american culture , so that 's why i do n't think english would be equally accepted everywhere . 
  while i do agree that english is more useful outside europe , the issue here would be interethnic communication within europe , in which case i believe esperanto would be better as it would n't be stepping on any toes . 
  oh yeah , i know that , i just read the trust in eu institutions as overall eu support while the `` feeling european '' to me is more about one feeling to having things in common with other europeans rather than supporting eu itself . 
  also , i expected it to be higher . 
  while i 've always been supportive of a united , federal european state , there have been a few things that make me worried about such a state . 
  aside from the democracy , i 'm worried about transparency . 
  will a united europe just bring corruption into place with relatively low such ? 
  and how transparent would the new eu institutions be ? 
  how will be get each and every country to agree on one common law about transparency ? 
  coming from a country where nigh-on every official action is recorded and made accessible to the public , down to an mp 's cup of coffee ( if bought with public funds ) , i 'd hope to see something on a europe-wide level to prevent corrupt individuals from abusing it . 
  the law i was referring to is called the [ principle of public access ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitution_of_sweden#public_access_to_governmental_documents ) or * offentlighetsprincipen * in swedish . 
  the other question remaining in my head is what language should be used as the working language . 
  having a common army and a common bureaucracy necessitates people from the various countries to be able to understand each other , or at least for those working in these institutions to do so . 
  it would also cut back a lot on translation costs , which use up quite a bit of money . 
  there have been suggestions of esperanto filling that role , which might be a good option for countries where people would n't want to learn another country 's language because it would be seen as `` cultural imperialism '' or whatnot . 
   i do n't feel that to be a londoner i have to feel any particular allegiance to the rest of the political entity in which i reside ( not to imply antipathy ) . 
  just want say , i feel exactly the same . 
  but being a londoner , what 's your experience on other londoners ' thoughts and feelings about the eu ? 
  like , what views do you encounter most often ? 
  nay , i was referring to this link ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/maptoolclosed.do?tab=map&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdgo510&amp;toolbox=types# ) , which frivilligt posted and still remains at the near top of this page . 
  i 'm surprised at some of these . 
  like greece , for example . 
  hell , that 's what i usually associate europe with . 
  the name for our entire continent is even taken from their ancient mythology !, 
  the second is hungary , i had no idea so many there felt european , especially now that nationalist sentiments seem to be the latest trend , and a dominating one at that . 
  wonder if it has anything to do with nationalists from neighbouring countries calling then non-european ... also , i did n't expect my own country to be in the yellow : i always thought sweden was a rather pro-eu country . 
  then again , it 's 49 % , so it 's only half the country disliking it . 
  besides , i kind of wonder many are n't simply too fond of how the eu works today but like the idea of the eu in general . 
  so there 's a big difference in attitudes toward the eu between london and the rest of the country ? 
  also , i 'd be rather interested to see how different the results would be for the various constituent countries . 
  best way to do that would be to hold referendums on eu-membership , also making compulsory and binding so that a country whose populace is mostly against eu-membership will be bar from joining . 
  at least it would solve the whole legitimacy problem , with the people deciding for themselves instead of the governments going over their heads . 
  thanks !, 
  mighty enlightening . 
  about jobbik , they have n't been involved in any murders or other felonies so far , as i can recall , though my memory might just be bad . 
  they did set up a militia kind of unit , the magyar g\u00e1rda , which has since been disbanded by law and fragmented into multiple splinter groups that run around and like to play police . 
  one of these groups set up a `` training camp '' in a heavily roma-populated village , marched around and `` kept the peace '' . 
  the roma were evacuated from there for the duration of it . 
  policial ties ... 
  i think they do . 
  if not direct ties , then at least influence . 
  there was a police labour union that released some statement that `` it 's every hungarian citizens duty to fight the jews '' or something like that . 
  did i mention they like to march around in nazi-inspired uniforms ? 
  back to greece , considered their anti-austerity stance ( at least according to wikipedia ) , would n't the independents rather side with syriza ? 
  also , i keep hearing that the kke are a bunch of stalinists ... is that true ? 
  and if yes , how did such a party manage to survive into the modern age ? 
  o.o thanks beforehand !, 
  is chrysi avgi more comparable to jobbik in hungary then , or are they even worse than that ?

  an interesting plot twist . 
  and , make the murderer german so you can unite against a common enemy :-) . 
  hmm . 
  i wonder how they will do with the language . 
  in bron/broen/the bridge everyone spoke danish/swedish to another and understood each other . 
  i am neither french nor english , but is that a likely scenario in france/england ? 
  to be clear , this has n't happened yet , nor have it been investigated if it 's even legal to do this . 
  the suggestion came yesterday . 
  that is weird , i did n't know that . 
  wonder why it 's like that ? 
  while swede 's are not really not fond of drafts , it is because it can really cold here . 
  otherwise , we are big on fresh air , and in the summer i often have the window ( s ) open , and often a few minutes/day in the winter . 
  it 's the same with wet hair , it is not really fun if your hair is wet if it 's is -15 degrees outside ( like now ) ... wonder where the idea about bad draft comes from . 
  does anybody know ? 
  haha , it would be then french then , would n't it :-) . 
  i am probably going to hell for this , but the ss - uniforms were really cool looking , and the wehrmachts too . 
  i know , hugo boss ... 
  it 's like that in movies too , the bad ones gets the cool look . 
   it 's not enough that some countries make agreements and others politely decline : the entire continent must jump in with both feet together , lest they face the wrath of the online euro-weeny . 
  i agree . 
  i have already been referred to as a `` free rider '' in this thread ... . . we do n't even have the euro , and we have being net payers to the eu since we joined . 
  the biggest problem to me is , that it seems to be the same people who do n't want to deal with the root of the problem or the democratic deficit that is currently plaguing europe . 
  the euro is incorrectly constructed from the beginning . 
  having a one currency is certainly not wrong in itself , but if you want that , you need to change the way it is constructed , have proper permanent transfers etc. 
  however , no one wants to fix that , because then the stupid people would have to vote for it , and the same stupid people would probably vote no . 
  so , let us just use band aids instead , and then blame anyone who disagrees with us . 
   that 's why this time they try to implement it it within the eu framework . 
  so your snide remark about `` start at home '' misses the point . 
  no , that is if you * only * think of a tobin tax as a tax , with no implications and no purpose . 
  however , it is n't . 
  as i am sure you know , one of the many purposes with the tobin tax is not just to raise money but to ( for example ) curb the robot trading ( that is what we call it in swedish , sorry do not know the english name ) . 
  another reason is to try to tax undertaxed business , banks and financial institutes . 
  thus , if those countries * do * want to start getting more money from banks and financial institutes , why do n't they start with doing a proper bank save . 
  if you compare it to the swedish bank save in the 90 's who is generally seen as a very good save , you should know that while sweden paid 3-4 % of their gdp to save their banks , they also demanded collateral , and changed the rules for the banks . 
  ergo - swedish banks know that while they might survive , they will loose ownership . 
  also , in the end , selling all those shares back , + being owner of nordea actually paid all the money from the bank save back , + then some . 
  why , if the euro countries are truly interested in getting money back , and actually `` domsticating '' their banks , for real , have n't they done that ? 
  nothing is stopping them . 
  why ? 
  edit : spelling, 
  that was a rather cool scarf . 
  btw , maybe i am a bit old fashioned , but should n't the soldier be investigated for the things he actually * did * , as opposed to things he * wears * ? 
  a few years back there was sort of a `` skull fashion '' , here in sweden , you could see them on shoes , scarf etc. 
  maybe his scarf was just old . 
   quite a lot of the companies who orchestrated the current financial mess the world is in - you may have heard - do business out of london yes , let us all get try to destroy london , that will help . 
  and no one , in frankfurt has ever done , anything bad . 
  or spain , or france . 
  it is all the big bad brits . 
  btw - can you explain the bank save in spain again ? 
  why didi n't germany/france ( unlike sweden and finland when they did their bank saves ) demand collateral ? 
  are n't you just giving the bank money if you do n't ask for collateral ( like shares ) . 
  at least in sweden 's case it was actually a good deal for the tax payers/people , who saved the banks . 
  how come that is n't happening in the euro areas ? 
  if you want to stop the big bad bankers , why do n't you start at home ? 
  as i said in another thread , this is perfect . 
  i personally do n't believe in it and i am happy that my country ( sweden ) do n't do it , but that does n't mean that other countries should n't be allowed to try whatever taxes they want . 
  it is a win-win . 
  the countries that want it , can have it , those of us who does n't , can stay outside . 
  if it does n't work for those 11 countries who are trying it - they can skip it . 
  if it does - wonderful . 
  for those outside ( the 186 or something other countries ) we will either gain trade or things will stay the same . 
  i like it when it works out for everybody . 
  i wish they would do it here , just tax it instead . 
  so , your employer lets you get away with that then i suppose . 
  i think i would n't show up either then , but it is a bit harder here :-) . 
   if an evil mastermind wanted to cripple this country , the first thing they 'd go to would be a machine that makes it snow . 
  i laughed out loud . 
  that is a really good plan . 
  instead of drones , missiles etc , you just attack britain with several snow cannons - and you are doomed . 
   to steal the hundreds of billions in oil and other natural resources yet to be discovered . . 
  exactly - that is how evil they are . 
  they know of natural resources no one else does . 
  it must be the lizzard power . 
  i have some friends in the uk who are quite perplexed . 
  they do n't understand why people do not show up for work etc. 
  oh , i forgot macedonia , good one . 
  i think germany and the imf are at fault too . 
   not as lovely as your username . 
  hedgehogs . 
   why , the zionist/maconnic nwo , of course . 
  the lizzards , do n't forget the lizzards !, 
  ( had to google maconnic , that is freemasons right ? ), 
  sweden : * poverty , or what it is , or is n't . 
  * new minister * apparently there is a suggestion that one should start charging people the tv tax , even if they do not have a tv , just a computer . 
  just came today , in my opinion not very likely . 
  * mali/algeria - ( norwegian ) hostages . 
  ok , really , i thought of it more as in extra added hours . 
  anyway , what he should know then is that it depends on the school , more than the program . 
   will they just withdraw the tax if it fails though ? 
  i think so . 
  if it fails like the swedish one , the failure will be spectacular . 
  also , it is not like the ftt is super popular in all of the countries that is implementing it . 
  i am not the german opposition , but if i were , i would attack that tax like it was satan coming to attack germany , branding merkel ( satan 's pawn ) irresponsible , hating the economy , sell - out to the south etc. 
  they have an election coming up . 
  also , i have no problems seeing financial professors in france explaining again and again why it is stupid etc. 
  also , even this time around they could n't even get all the euro countries to join in - if the tax fail , i do n't see how they can convince them to jump * on * to the sinking ship . 
  honestly , you are not worthy of being a politician , either ruling who wants to score points and say no ( who knows , he just might be a financial sensible one ) or in opposition who will use the ftt again and again as an example of just how big loosers the government are . 
   while i agree that it would be great for such experiments between willing countries to be conducted in the eu they have a tendency to become ` destiny ' , e.g. 
  the euro , schnegen . 
  true , but i hope we have all learned from those .

  that 's pretty awesome . 
  that 's a weird name for that plant in swedish . 
  literally * iron oak * . 
  i 've heard it before but never knew what it refers to before . 
  assumed it was an oak ... 
  what 's a toff ? 
  no , i just make sure i do n't have all my giant stacks of money lying around all over the place before they come . 
  `` would of '' is a far more pressing matter . 
  the it ` sers can be taught , but i see absolutely no hope for the would ofers . 
  yup , sounds like basically the same thing but you eat different things with it . 
  i would n't say it 's delicious exactly , but it gets the job done . 
  ] ( https://res.cloudinary.com/hufennija/image/upload/f_auto,q_50,fl_progressive,w_1200,h_630,c_fill/27769725.jpg ) it 's like a thick pancake with bits of pork made in the oven instead of on the stove . 
  it 's super cheap to make and very , very filling . 
  obviously served with lingonberry jam , which every swede has at home already . 
  uh , not really . 
  we have a lot of swear words about demons , hell and satan and all that , but they 're considered mild next to the sexual ones ( cunt , cock , fag , etc. ) . 
  we do of course combine them , but when we do it 's mainly just nonsense . 
  something like * j\u00e4vla fittb\u00f6gshelvete * , for example , would be a really strong swear in swedish , and i do n't even know how to translate that . 
  it makes absolutely no sense in any language . 
  * devilish cunt-fag-hell * , i guess . 
  recently i 've been drinking a lot of karlova\u010dko . 
  it 's bloody good . 
  i do n't think we 're very funny . 
  about time we took the backseat , anyway . 
  i 'm sure you 'll treat us right . 
  and those are n't anywhere close to all the words we borrowed from low german in the middle ages . 
  there were so many germans up here for a while that it permanently changed swedish grammar and even * pronunciation * . 
  we imported prefixes like be - and ver - ( now * f\u00f6r - * in swedish ) to verbs that are still used in creating new words . 
  the old thick l that was standard swedish before is now only present in rural accents . 
  we even changed the old nordic letters \u00e6 and \u00f8 to the german \u00e4 and \u00f6 . 
  i did n't know they were scientific terms . 
  they are n't in swedish , really . 
  gyttja just means mud , pretty much - at least in everyday speech . 
  i 'd be pretty shocked to meet someone like that in sweden . 
  i think i 'd assume they would n't be able to accept * me * rather than the other way around , on account of my ungodly ways . 
  we would n't be very likely to become close friends , i 'd say . 
  yeah it is , but we made the word first and then the english loaned it as is . 
  the words `` motor '' and `` pedal '' are the same in swedish , so it worked out great . 
  interestingly , poltern comes from an indo-european root which was something like * bhel * . 
  accounting for various sound changes over the years , the swedish version ended up as buller/bullra , but still has the exact same meaning . 
  i think `` kiosk '' is turkish , too . 
  i 've never heard sloyd either . 
  i 'm only familiar with the term `` woodshop '' from american movies , but that 's specifically about tr\u00e4sl\u00f6jd . 
  yeah , it 's a pretty shitty list . 
  just stole it from wikipedia , to be honest . 
  sure . 
  it 's actually an acronym for ingvar kamprad elmtaryd agunnaryd , which is the name of the founder and the name of the farm and village where he grew up . 
  you 're right of course , but the specific use of the word `` orienteering '' for the sport where people run around in the woods with maps and compasses is swedish in origin . 
  it 's not really a word , is it ? 
  just the name of a company . 
  alvar angstrom fartlek gravlax lek lingonberry moped ombudsman orienteering sloyd smorgasbord tungsten kn\u00e4ckebr\u00f6d trapp gyttja varve ... are apparently all the swedish loanwords in english . 
  most of them are n't in common use , i guess , but there you go . 
  * every * single week ? 
  the most religious ( young ) person i 've ever known still only went on major holidays . 
  and she was pretty damn religious . 
  maybe . 
  i 'm not really involved in language policies in finland though . 
  it was n't always just 5 % though . 
  the swedish speaking population in finland used to be way higher than that , but they sort of suppressed it for a bit while they were building up their own national identity after achieving independence . 
  at what point do you go `` uh , it 's only 10 % now , fuck em '' ? 
  plenty of swedes have coats of arms . 
  [ all of the noble families ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/svenska_adels%c3%a4tter ) should have one of their own . 
  lots of them are still around . 
   `` finland gave swedish an official language status even though the swedish-speaking population is smaller and it is working fine for them '' wow , that 's a terrible argument . 
  swedish has been spoken side by side with finnish for like 800 years in finland . 
  it 's a very old phonetic rule in swedish that certain consonants turn into fricatives or glides before front vowels . 
  k is _ supposed to _ become a sh-type of sound before an e in proper swedish , there 's nothing weird about that . 
  what 's problematic about it is that `` kex '' is a loan word . 
  it comes from english `` cakes '' , which obviously has a hard k. for some swedes , it 's been so thoroughly swedified that it 's now pronounced shex , but for most it 's still kex . 
  no , but they would be if everyone drove manuals like here . 
  two or three times a week roughly . 
  i usually make enough for a couple of meals so i can eat leftovers the rest of the time . 
  will probably get some takeout once or twice a week too . 
  :p i remember that we looked at some old norse writings and compared them with modern translations , though , to see how swedish is related to it . 
  it 's not dative , it 's just the object form . 
  english does not differentiate between the accusative and dative cases grammatically . 
  it 's '' * whom * did you see ? '', 
  just as well as `` to * whom * did you give it ? 
  '' , where one is a direct object and the other is an indirect object . 
  i think what tony 's on about is that the whole whom-thing is slowly but surely dying out in english , since everyone actually says `` who did you see ? '', 
  and `` who did you give it to ? '', 
  thus , using `` whom '' ` correctly ' automatically makes you sound more proper and formal , just because it 's old and unusual at this point . 
  so how do you slice your cheese then ? 
  you 're not making sandwiches like that without an osthyvel . 
  i 'll get away with it because i 'm swedish and have a charming accent . 
  i just use `` du '' with all germans now . 
  i 've had way more people smirk at me for using `` sie '' than i 've had people taking offense to `` du '' . 
  and if someone is actually offended about that , that 's probably not a person i want to talk to anyway . 
  lighten up , sheesh . 
  from a swedish perspective , that shit is absolutely ridiculous . 
  standard swedish does n't use binding e 's like that . 
  dialects in the south do , though . 
  they do n't . 
  [ this ] ( http://ark-tryckaren.se/wp-content/themes/boilerplate/images/decor-sizes/ostmacka.png ) type of sandwich is n't a thing outside of norway and sweden . 
  i refer you to my original post . 
  i believe i 've made my stance clear here ? 
  i do n't think there should be * countries * , period . 
  not even the us airforce managed to respond in time and prevent two planes from crashing into the wtc in new york god damn city , what chance do we have of preventing something like that ? 
  none . 
  maybe if we spent every waking hour watching out for hijackers , spending billions on planes and pilots to keep our skies safe , but you know what ?

  some say that is what makes us so identifiable , 
  get rid of potato , add one more guinness, 
   little ? 
  warsaw by that map is in different country the map is a little bit rotated , but you are waaaaaayyy off in how off it is http://i.imgur.com/tmwv4bc.jpg here is the two maps , scaled rotated so they are aligned , you can see they a slightly different but not as much as you claim , i tried to align silesia and k\u00f6eningsberg if i tried to make it a tiny bit more accurate i think they would move closer to eachother rather than away . 
  in any case , warsaw is still where warsaw is today . 
  not in belarus or wherever . 
  what ? , have you looked at a map of poland before ? 
  sure op is a * little bit off * like a couple of pixels here and there , not half a country off :p, 
   but if i go to barcelona i still speak spanish and the experience is much more rewarding than speaking another language . 
  wait , you propose speaking french when in france , but not catalan when in barcelona ?!?!? 
  well logically , all it means is that they could move up the minimum sentence length to one year , even for lesser crimes :o but realistically , that wouldnt happen . 
   i just do n't believe the canal would pay for it self considering the detour is not too great and the actual flow of goods from varna to dunabe is insignificant ( i think , never heard of such flow ) . 
  most canal works are done with centuries in mind , it will easily pay for itself over that time period , or you could `` hire '' russian pow like we did here in sweden to make it happen , 
  just you wait , soon greece will blame sweden too, 
  you didnt get theology/social structure studies in school ? 
  they explain it pretty well, 
  surely it is the patriarchal agenda to make it seem like it would be a matriarchy , but we all know that the only reason women compete with women is because of pressure from the men !, 
  ( seriously , this line has been done at me exactly 1 time on facebook , its like they would be seriously upset if equality were ever achieved ( i mean its pretty close over here ) ), 
  * rolls up serious armchair field marshal sleeves * based upon what really ? 
  things to consider : nato is a defensive alliance there would be no support from there as this would be an offensive war , and article 5 of the north atlantic treaty only require the intervention in accordance with charter of the united nations - article 51 , self defense . 
  so ... next up is finland , http://www.ibtimes.com/scared-russia-sweden-finland-make-war-pact-1821906 , so a war with sweden is a war with finland . 
  this puts the tally at 19995 +36479 active ( 29823 + 354000 ( thats not a typo ) reserve ) vs 17500 active ( 218 886 reserve ) now thats just pure manpower stuff , consider that sweden have roughly 500 000 military service aged men with basic training ( 15 months conscription ) add to that about 10 times higher defense budget of sweden + finland a very well equipped air force ( 100 ~ mission ready jas 39 gripen , 50 ~ f/a 18 ( finland ) ) vs a pretty much nonexistant air force . 
  and a pretty decent navy ( 9 corvettes , 11 minesweeper ,12 patrol boat and 147 cb90 combat boats ( cool stuff ) ) vs 1 frigate and 4 minesweepers . 
  never mind that we have 500 ~ cv9040 and 150 ~ leopard ii ready over here once estonia manages to land their 44 cv9040 so ... in a purely defensive aspect  estonia might win that one miles off . 
  on the other hand a self defensive invasion of estonia by sweden/finland is probably pretty hard , however naval + air superiority , it might not be that troublesome . 
  remember * armchair field marshal sleeves *, 
  thats sweden for you , eternal gold medal in design and image . 
  its a sort of general idea here in sweden that estonia aspires or at least likes sweden/finland a lot . 
  there is a joke going around that estonia would declare war on sweden just to become annexed by us . 
  well technically you could make a slighty less efficient anchored platform , have the main part also flowing, 
  2 million kgs is only 2000 cubic meter . 
  thats like a small lawn going up and down 1 meter . 
  its like a small ship, 
  they claim the final design to be 10 meter in diameter which looking at the shape gives it roughly 230 cubic meters . 
  the one in the video looks like they are roughly 6 meter in diameter which is about 50 cubic meters . 
  simply put , we wanted it more . 
  not going to be so much of a hostile nation if it is ceded to argentina , i mean its half across the globe what are they going to do ? 
  from a third party point of view uk seems to be the hostile one , the islands are clearly of a regional interest for argentina , and i will bet you 2 shits that their opinion on the matter is exactly the same as your opinion on china 's claim on south china sea , except from a third party 's view china 's claim is almost sensible . 
  it clearly is a swedish archipelago of egentliga finland a swedish province in the former swedish \u00d6sterland . 
  geezus , never has it been so easy to be a terrorist , you swallowed their agenda whole . 
  the point is to not recognize isis as a state , because it is none that we wish to exist because the idea of isis is revolting . 
  there is a precedence , 1921 the \u00c5land islands between finland and sweden voted almost unanimously to be incorporated into sweden , being that they are 90 % swedish and speak swedish , but league of nations decided that finland has a better claim as the island is `` clearly '' a finnish archipelago . 
  thats why toast is the superior way of eating bread . 
  we use a fridge for that, 
  china is also converting to cashless at lightspeed , street vendors take card and digital transfer using wechat and alipay and it works flawlessly because every one got internet access and everyone has a smartphone . 
  ( everyone with money to spend ) its also incredibly competitive market there , if you dont have a cashless alternative ready someone else will just take your place within days . 
  i have probably not paid for a kebab with cash since 2006 here in sweden . 
  the future is here man !, 
  just wait till you can pay for kebab with your phone !, 
  they do a bunch of kebab like food in central and western china , love their bbq lamb, 
  the question was how to prevent chernobyl not how to imagine the unimaginable, 
  see , simple stuff !, 
  well , scandinavia and europe in general is a pretty good spot to do it on . 
  step 1 : dont be chernobyl . 
  step 2 : dont be stupid . 
  step 3 : dont disable safety measures . 
  step 4 : dont be stupid . 
  most if not all historical accidents are solvable by a layman . 
  dont want a fukushima ? 
  dont build a reactor on a volcanic island that are susceptible to tsunamis, 
   but halal method is killing them as quickly as possible , without suffering . 
  basically means = slitting a cows throat is halal . 
  if you claim that slitting a cows throat is halal then your statement that  killing them as quickly as possible , without suffering . 
  is false , because it is not the quickest way , nor is it without suffering . 
  the perspective is that travelling through europe is not dangerous at all compared to war . 
   sankt petersburg was built on old finnic lands . 
  well ... actually , it was * swedish * lands . 
  its like someone did a deal with the devil to get that beneficial contract . 
  so much land but no sea, 
  paging / u/vonadler he will tell you all about the amazing leadership we have had in sweden in the form of kings . 
  we have also had a bunch of 0 ambition twats that managed to squander a lot of stuff . 
  i mean the baltic sea could have been known as the swedish sea !!!, 
   slaves implying they actually get to work :| in sweden the current statistic is 60 % of all refugees that has been in the country for more than 10 years is still unemployed, 
  well , a boltgun to the head is pretty instantaneous , so in comparison halal is not quick at all, 
   but hey if it 's going to be done sweden is n't going to leave these guys in tents heh , i guess you missed the part where plan ~ ~ b ~ ~ ~ ~ c ~ ~ ~ ~ d ~ ~ e was to house them in tents , apparantly there is not that many tents in sweden ready for this kind of shit and the onces we have for disaster management/war you cant touch , unless national disaster or war , this is just 50k people or something needing roof over their head urgently . 
  no , the ferry is more like plan g. its actually a very flexible solution , so thats great . 
  yeah , the solution the the piss smell is to make a really nice central toilet facility attended by more than 1 person , but wait !, 
  its not free , you have to pay 10 sek to go in , so up with your card that you use to pay everywhere else , oh whats that you cant pay with card ? 
  but cash hasnt existed for a decade !, 
  then you go to the nearest checkout , buy a ticket and ask for some cash as well to get into the toilet , what ? 
  they dont handle cash there ? 
  evidently they have an atm machine now and a machine that changes your 100 sek bills into 10s ( or 20s or 50s ) , but it took a damn while , and you have to ask 5 people before you get the idea . 
  and last time i saw they took cards , finally , but sheeeeet its like the station designer has a fetish for pee smell and frustrated people . 
  so yeah i bet most people just piss anywhere out of spite , i dont want to spend 10 minutes walking around the area just to get some coins so i can piss, 
  in sweden we also got the power to remove a monarch or remove a crown prince/princess right to the throne and basically put whoever we want there . 
  it 's just that since the heirs are born they get schooled into being a monarch , imagine the first day on the job when you got 45 years of practice and tutoring by the nest professionals in many political areas . 
  our monarch has done great jobs when negotiating with kingdoms like saudi arabia and thailand , having a king is something other countries ruled by a king respect . 
  actually the people , its less of an normal election and more of a `` do we think this french marshal is a suitful adoptive crownprince of sweden and our future king '' , the riksdag decided ` yes ' 206 years ago . 
  ever since then the people have literally had the power to just say no and poof , no more kings or queens , its just that it wouldnt make sense to take away something that is a net gain , they hold no power and they are told what to do by the people . 
  if we go back to the middle ages we actually elected our kings in a normal `` election '', 
  nah , we 're fine with ours , 
  probably as easy , just harder to not get noticed in the city  so planning a murder is no problem , getting away with it is hard !, 
  yep , makes perfect sense !, 
  sweden also had a plan to land 100 nukes with a supersonic strategic bomber ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saab_36 ) in moscow until the 70s . 
  we just didnt get to do any exercise runs :p, 
  night should be spelled night while nite should be pronounced nit\u00e9h, 
  a lot of languages are dictated by a committee , that committee is also changing the language so that it follows the natural process . 
  other languages , like english and french change with a natural process and then suddenly the official standard is nowhere near the natural language . 
  on the other end we have swedish and german and japanese which is very clear and consistent in how it looks officially and how it is used , ( swedish gets updated constantly to get with the flow . 
  ahem , visby disagrees,

  but i do not trust that the government has taken the steps needed for this to work smoothly . 
  though it 's not an official anthem , i love [ flower of scotland ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnkkn-djxt8 ) . 
  especially if they bring in bagpipes and sing it in gaelic . 
  it 's also a quite recent song , presented in 1967 , which is quite cool . 
  lettland in swedish , so almost the same . 
  aye well , technically it was quelling of a rebellion rather than an invasion , since norway had already been renounced by denmark in favour of sweden , in exchange for swedish pommeria . 
   if you read some post-napoleonic war literature , you will see how the authors tried to cope with the loss of norway . 
  sounds a bit like when sweden lost it 's then eastern half , finland . 
  there is a tale that saint erik saw a golden cross in the sky against the blue sky when he landed on the first crusade in finland . 
  this lacks any real sources though , even the actual crusade is questioned to have happened if i remember correctly . 
  yet again the same scenario as with the nationalization of lands appear . 
  if it is okey to strip the royal family of their lands due to the history of the monarchs of england , from times where values were held very differently , what other claims would then be completely justified on the same basis ? 
  would a sami claim to lappi be so absurd then ? 
  and you would only have to keep going backwards in said vast piles of documentation to find new and new claims to different areas , treasures , properties and symbols . 
  in cases of peasant revolts , most certainly . 
  those do n't tend to happen in europe anymore . 
  now days it would most probably be far more of a legal process , and incredibly complicated one at that . 
  doubt the lands would be completely nationalized , unless there were some grand scandal and abuse from said monarch involved . 
  and if you can strip the royal family of their private holdings , what is to stop that from being done to other land owners ? 
  big to small ? 
  if the country is n't socialist , this would go against the ideology of the government and people who voted them in . 
  and even then , where do you make the distinction from who 's land you can nationalize for the good of the masses ? 
  i do n't know if the spanish monachy has any power , the swedish one certainly does n't . 
  how ever , i took it as if he talked about the expenses of the royalty , which is often an argument brought up against monarchies and why they should be removed . 
  at least the british monarchy is also a large landowner , but ( simplified ) give their gainings from that to the state in exchange for a salary of sorts , meaning that in the end the give more to the kingdom than they take . 
  [ cgpgrey explained it quite well .

  hungary is part of the european union . 
  has there been any discussion among the other states , at significant levels , concering this ? 
  hardly heard anything about it at all here in sweden . 
  i thought helsinki was built as a result of sveaborg ( suomenlinna ) ? 
  fortresses tend to attract settlements . 
  red alert theme kind of ruins it , to be fair . 
  no , i mean the italian courts when he asked for financial support , hence he went to the spanish crown . 
  the fact that people today find some kind of odd sense of patriotism in him is another thing . 
  did n't the italians deny him ? 
  even if he was italian himself . 
  naturally , it is not hard to understand why they did it . 
  but personally i do n't feel it justifies it . 
  i would probably speak of [ certain actions during the civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_civil_war#bitter_legacy ) , if i were to talk about anything from the history of finland which can be portrayed as shameful , with about 13000 dead in prisoncamps alone . 
  [ baltutl\u00e4mingen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_extradition_of_baltic_soldiers ) , i would say . 
  after the second world war sweden handed over about 150 baltic soldiers to the soviet union , to almost certain death . 
  utter spineless cowadice from the swedes . 
  oh yeah , this is totally related to antisemitism . 
  it has to be , what ill can anyone feel about the glorious and perfect nation of israel ? 
  you often see people from outside europe who seem to think that the eu is a country in the sense the us is , and that it has a dominant culture . 
  this article kind of plays on that , considering that there are probably more difference between a portuguese and a romanian than there are between an englishman and an american . 
  making a list like this would require a lot of variables to come closer to the truth . 
  probably from the american side as well , since the states have cultural differences , though not to the same degree as the european nations . 
  honestly , dubai is probably the coolest city i 've been in . 
  it 's like a mix of gotham city and something from a sci-fi movie with people in dresses . 
  it 's such a shame the people are so backwards , else it would be an incredible place in more ways than just architecture . 
  stupid abba . 
  the swedes are the only ones with an exception on the ban of creating and trading snus * ( snuff ? 
  ) * , though !, 
  finland had a careful relationship with the soviet union back in the day . 
  completely understandable since they did not wish to end up in another war with the giant nextdoor . 
  how ever , this did not exactly create any great friendship with the us at the time , who would rather see allies serving their interests all across the board . 
  the cold war is over and wounds are almost healed , but , i think finland still wishes to tread carefully when it comes to foreign policy around the us . 
  no doubt it 's still a delicate matter on the political and bureaucratic front . 
  yes !, 
  the finnish guy said it in finnish and swedish !, 
  that makes me happy , respecting the minority . 
  honestly , the major parties are not all that good at the whole internet thing . 
  their websites reflect very much those of companies and organisations . 
  their `` buisness plan '' , most important people , some pretty pictures and so on . 
  it 's easier and far more time efficient to get these parties views from tv and newspapers rather than visiting their websites . 
  smaller parties , especially controversial ones , are far more rooted into the internet culture of anonymous chats and forums , and their websites tend to reflect that . 
  they wo n't get media coverage unless they do something outrageous , so they have to find alternative ways to extend their views . 
  the largest swedish discussion forum , flashback.org , political part has very much been hijacked ( or at least used to be ) by far-right influenced people , which quite reflect the way they extend their views . 
  in the end it comes down to weighing what is worth it and minimizing the risk of it being exploited . 
  good answer , thanks . 
  yep . 
  but when it comes to things that can do as much harm as it can do good , it 's good to be paranoid . 
  well that 's not quite true . 
  it was quite an outrage inside of sweden and discussion in the other nordic countries , since these are the ones which will be affected the most . 
  so to say that no one cares is quite a false statement . 
  if swedish companies had servers of the magnitude that google and microsoft does , i am sure many would care across the union , but since sweden do n't have it ( at the moment ) , it did n't create any major concern . 
  simply because so few are directly affected by it . 
  quite the contrast from the prism situation , where most people are using microsoft and google all the time . 
  it 's not so much about what the current gouverment does with it . 
  you may be okey with them doing it and trust them . 
  but they wont be removed , and what the unknown gouverments of the future may use them for is the big issue . 
  it 's the same in sweden with the fra-law . 
  once a law is passed it is very difficult to get rid off . 
  though we might trust our current gouverment , no one is to say what the future gouverments might use it for and how the situation in the world looks then . 
  i thought i would reply on the swedish part of your argument , just to make things a bit more clear . 
  there are major differences between fra ( f\u00f6rsvarets radioanstalt , swedish ) and prism . 
  i 've to run to work , else i would have translated it for you , but i felt i had to drop this here since i do not feel that you can compare fra and prism in the manner done here . 
  i hope that google translate is sufficient for now , i will try to find the other ( better ) article once i 've time . 
  to quote itzhak skenstr\u00f6m , austria - golden land of culture , and fascism !, 
  roughly translated , of course . 
  to be honest , my main concern with this is that our politicians will now use this to say empty words and draw attention away from pressing issues within the county . 
  the important calls are all controversial . 
  there are many views and different people who will be affected differently , thus , since they want to remain in power and keep getting massive paychecks for their work , this is an excellent opportunity of gaining a lot without really doing anything at all . 
  simply saying `` america spying on you is bad ! '', 
  is a win-win situation for them . 
  though i am fairly certain they would find another way to avoid doing what is needed anyhow .

  good point . 
  though i trust the us more than europe , there 's simply too much at stake geopolitically if it can suddenly be argued that their guarantees of security are not to be trusted . 
  ely5 : the current global geopolitical balance would go to absolute shit if the us did n't honor it 's obligations to see an attack on any nato member as an attack on itself ; and russia can not fight the full might of nato in . 
  an attack on a eu , but non-nato member would be more complicated but the same thing would probably apply . 
   the left wing extremists are scum . 
  so are the right wing . 
  any extremists . 
  they are undemocratic idiot youths . 
  agreed 100 % . 
  but , violent attacks and persecution against representatives of any non-extreme left-wing party , including sd , are very rare however and carried out by individuals on the fringe of an already extremist movement . 
   noone cares if someone steals from or hurts a sweden democrat . 
  it 's such an overwhelming crackdown that i am surprised that sd even survived . 
  this is 100 % bullshit . 
  you 're mixing up things here . 
  those violently attacked by left-wing extremists were mostly part of [ smr ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_resistance_movement ) who are actual militant '' * the international jewish conspiracy controls world finance and media and are trying to exterminate the white race through feminization and mass immigration * '' - nazis . 
  sd are however somewhat unfairly reported on by mainstream media and their rights to free speech is often violated at public rallies , where left-wing supporters make noise and cause disturbances . 
  `` standard conservative '' according to some , right-wing populists according to most . 
  russia still has work camps as punishment ? 
  any sources on that ? 
  alternate title : * islamic extremist makes sweden go ' * meh * ' with tv-threat * the fact that there are swedish ( and other european ) citizens radical enough to be getting their jihad on in the middle east is worrysome of course , but the national threat level has n't changed and people seem to take the news calmly . 
   * china 's xi jinping drove a brutal bargain in may on a future gazprom pipeline , securing a price near $ 350 per 1,000 cubic metres that is barely above russia 's production costs . 
  *   * pieties aside , the two countries are rivals in central asia , where china is systematically building pipelines that break russia 's stranglehold . 
  china has large territorial claims on far eastern russia , land seized from the qing dynasty in the 19th century . 
  * sounds like a lovely relationship compared to how horrible russia has fared doing business with europe !,

  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl-s2jdcdhu ) ( in swedish ), 
  that 's where you and most people of the civilised world disagree . 
  ouch , all those positive comments must really sting . 
  ironically most people in this thread seem to identify more with a black dutchman rather than a slovak with early-last-century ideas about race and nationality . 
  yeah i meant that sarcastically , you know in the way ` murica brings * freedom * !, 
  ukraine , prepare to recieve some * glasnost * and * perestrojka * !, 
  hah good luck . 
  exporting military hardware is essential for covering costs of r&d , which can be important for small countries to produce their own systems . 
  but i agree , those exports should be heavily regulated so as to not sell to ongoing conflicts and not to states that regularly abuse human rights or international law . 
  sweden for example is a small country with an important military industry , with lots of nice regulations which cause our government to hesitate calling saudi arabia a dictatorship which violates human rights . 
  freedom from euronazi propaganda !, 
  freedom from homosex !, 
  freedom from weakling democratic system !, 
  yeah like , sanctions and stuff - ugh so boring !, 
  why have n't we totally nuked moscow yet i mean god all those warheads are just collecting dust . 
  and nato kinda needs a new job now that afghanistan thing is all over so they should just totally like , occupy or annex russia or whatever . 
  and totally give them human rights and economy and stuff oh and crimea to ukraine . 
  geopolitics is n't exactly rocket science , duh !, 
  funny how so many so often attribute the same kind of rethoric to 2 billion muslims ... 
  you say `` the west '' as if we were all the same political entity . 
  afghanistan was approved by the un and many non-western powers , most of the eu was thoroughly against the war in iraq and the limited intervention against ghadaffi was requested by libyan rebels themselves , after which they completely failed to reach any sort of national unity . 
  yes , i agree he did n't expect the maidan protests to be so strong or yanukovich to run away with his tail between his legs . 
  but i 'd still say everything he 's done since that is according to plan . 
  his attitude towards georgia , ukraine and everything else in his percieved russian sphere of influence has long pointed to him preferring power politics over good relations to the west . 
  we 'll see how far he 'll go as the eu and us steps up . 
  well , not necessarily if he 's purposely turning away from the west and towards the east as i believe is the case . 
  do you honestly believe putin expected us to applaud things like the ukraine situation , crackdowns on dissent at sotji or increasing homophobia ? 
  meanwhile , china does n't care and central asian neighbours either suck up to russia or join out of fear as they know the west wo n't do shit for them . 
  you misunderstand , i 'm not saying russia is healthy , i am saying that the putin regime is successful in accomplishing its goals . 
  putin is a cold , calculating nationalist , not a crazed megalomaniac . 
  proving my point , we need russia in the short term . 
  russia 's surely got a market in china and the rest of asia * at least * in the long term . 
  could you link any sources on that ? 
  what i posted is mostly based on analysis from various western media and political institutes but i do n't have good information about how russians see it . 
  as far as i know , russia gained everything they wanted from crimea and got away with it scot free . 
  if anything , it was a loss of prestige for us in the west while internally , most russians support interventionism in ukraine . 
  sotji was indeed a success in the eyes of russians as nothing really went wrong and that putin made a point of hosting them in a formerly volatile area . 
  even when pussy riot were beaten by security forces many russians seem to be conservative and think they deserve it for what they did to the church and lack of patriotism . 
  the laws against homosexuality , outrage against eurovision and other moral issues seems to be another thing that enjoys wide support within russia and paints the eu and the west in general as something undesirable . 
  could you link any sources on that ? 
  not saying you 're wrong , but from what i have read thus far it seems to be more of a short term problem for europe than long term problem for russia . 
  china is certainly looking to lessen their energy dependency on the us , who can hopefully supply europe now that they 're producing a lot while russia faces east . 
  nah , the putin regime knows exactly what it 's doing . 
  they 've grabbed the strategically important crimea with few consequences , they 're punishing ukraine for chosing good relations to the eu rather than russia , they 're refocusing their exports to central asia and asia and strengthening their ties with china . 
  now they can paint europe as a threat and thus increase demand for strong ( authoritarian ) leadership , increased military spending and future use of coercion and intervention within russia 's sphere of influence . 
  yes , swedish national radio and television is excellent in this regard . 
  [ from wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sveriges_radio ) : * sveriges radio is a public limited company , owned by an independent foundation , and funded through a licensing fee determined by the swedish riksdag . 
  no advertising is permitted . 
  sr 's status could be described as that of a quasi-autonomous non-governmental organization . 
  * [ sveriges television ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sveriges_television ) works in pretty much the same way . 
  how long before we have these poor , [ `` disabled '' ] ( http://criticalmas.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/scooter.jpg ) people in europe ? 
  `` hey look at me , i 'm so fat i can neither walk nor take responsibility for my life anymore . 
  it 's a disease i tell ya !, 
  now excuse me while i [ roll over to the fast food joint . ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qmnrt45571k/t_hsv6u06hi/aaaaaaaarl8/4nkumx5frze/s1600/scooters+at+fast+food.jpg ) . 
  and who has time to [ cook for their kids ] ( http://www.smartambala.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/funny-fat-boy.jpg ) , anyway . '', 
  am i the only one who would like to see a mandatory eu-standardised course of english , both for school children and a similiar course for adults ? 
  i disagree , the emotions in the voices of the actors are definitely more important . 
  some of my favorite movies in languages i do n't understand are * am\u00e9lie * ( french ) , * lola rennt * ( german ) , * black cat white cat * ( romani and serbo-croatian-whatever-you-wanna-call-it ) and the * infernal affairs * trilogy ( chinese ) and i 'd never want to watch any of those in swedish or english . 
  i do n't know about the other countries , but i lived in spain and the acting is piss poor , it 's oftn the same actor doing multiple voices , every child in every movie sound the same , which also applies to every male black actor ( will smith in * men in black * sounds just like denzel washington in * remember the titans * , it 's hilarious ) . 
  really though , the headline sucks and there is n't even any form of link to anything of substance , not the election , not even anything to promote discussion . 
  the essence of a shitpost . 
  hah that is perfect , old juan carlos could get a new job !, 
  they are dependent on us too . 
  the us-eu economic relationship is extremly important for the whole globe : [ ec.europa.eu ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/united-states/ ) [www.fas.org ] ( http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/rl30608.pdf ) [ www.ustr.gov ] ( http://www.ustr.gov/sites/default/files/chapter%20i%20the%20presidents%20trade%20policy%20agenda.pdf ) i responded to someone who proposed the eu has to be a usa-style superpower in a new emerging multipolar cold war situation . 
  my reply , in short , is that i prefer to have the us on our side as that mere fact is more of a deterrent than anything we in europe can do on our own . 
  you 're right about good and bad federalism of course and no one knows for sure if a super-eu would be a force for true freedom and liberty , but right now i 'm concerned about growing european state nationalism and the huge expansion of surveillance in the name of fighting terror and crime in general . 
  i mean our national governments are already spying on us , what would improve if you put those powers in brussels ? 
  yeah , why are they even independent ? 
  they owe us a few decades worth of oil revenue !, 
  i meant we are dependent on them for defense and economy , and that is fine . 
  what we should avoid is federalization of the eu . 
  common , fully integrated defense , sure . 
  but a federated eu would probably devalue our democracy and freedom is what i meant . 
  hell no , we do n't stand a chance without the united states . 
  we 'd need to invest decades of time and resources for a defense and force projection on the level the us and nato provides us .

  i have n't really thought about how things look in countries without a single dominant language . 
  the fictional donald duck party ( * kalle anka-partiet * ) always gets some votes every election . 
  it 's been sort of a long-running joke to vote for them to show your displeasure with the system , without actually voting for some racist bastards or whatever other fringe parties might have gained traction at the time . 
  edit : if anyone feels like running [ this article ] ( https://nyheter24.se/maktkamp24/777452-11-knappa-partier-som-folk-rostade-pa ) through google translate it lists a bunch of the funniest weird parties that people voted for in the last election . 
  some of the highlights : `` masturbationists against nato '' , `` satanic initiative '' ( a riff on the actual feminist initiative party ) and `` the bajen party '' ( bajen being the nickname for hammarby , a football club in stockholm ) . 
  the anglosphere dominates certain genres , certainly . 
  i read a few horror/fantasy short story collections in swedish recently and was surprised by how much i enjoyed it , since i basically only ever read those kinds of stories in english . 
  writing really niche novels in a very small language usually wo n't end up with you rolling in cash . 
   but there are genres in which it is possible for swedish writers to make a living - usually detective stories . 
  not only is there a sizable domestic market for them , there 's also a fairly decent international demand for books of that type . 
  i 'm not really into those kinds of stories so i still rarely read swedish books , but it 's certainly * there * . 
  as far as what language i read in , it depends on the book . 
  if it was written in swedish or english , i read it in the original language . 
  if it was written in a language i ca n't read myself , i read whatever translation is available . 
  mostly swedish ones , naturally , but there are occasions where the english translation of a book comes out earlier ( or even just at all ) than a swedish one , in which case i grab that one . 
  the us and canadian dollar , absolutely . 
  remembering that mexico uses the peso took a moment , but it came to me eventually . 
  i keep track of the usd , british pound and euro exchange rates , since those are currencies i tend to buy stuff in . 
  the usd a little less so , perhaps , but it 's still good to know for a bunch of reasons . 
  i have no idea what the exchange rates for either the canadian dollar or the mexican peso are . 
  if i ever find myself in a situation where i 'm going there i 'll check it , but until then it 's not really relevant knowledge . 
  it 's complicated . 
  before the last election , i could have said a number of things . 
  i 'm a leftie , but for the most part i really respected the rightwing government we had . 
  they were the kind of liberals i really like . 
  we might have some different opinions on a lot of things , but at the end of the day i kind of felt that we were still on the same page in our basic values . 
  but i do n't feel that way under the new leadership they ( * moderaterna * , the biggest party in the rightwing bloc ) got after their defeat in the election . 
  they 've taken a turn too far right for me to follow , which is a shame . 
  i do respect * centern * for their stance with regards to immigration , though . 
  they 've stood steadfast and principled even as a lot of parties on both sides have lost their footing . 
  what 's red lemonade ? 
  i 've always seen it as a yellow drink because of the lemons . 
  if you substitute them for something else , it would n't feel like lemonade anymore . 
  to me , anyway . 
  yes !, 
  i do n't know if there is any differences between austrian and german leberk\u00e4se ( i 've only had it when visiting relatives in bavaria ) , but it 's the german food i miss the most . 
  huh , interesting . 
  til . 
  i guess that might explain why there seem to be so many andorrans/people with andorran flairs here . 
  i 've seen that flair a lot , which , given the population of andorra , seemed a bit odd . 
  i do n't mind the question as long as things do n't turn personal , but i do mind it when i 'm clearly in a bad state and people who i do n't want to have an honest discussion about it with ask me that . 
  since i 'm obviously unable to just brush it off i really have to be honest , and that just creates an entirely avoidable awkwardness . 
  it happened a lot when i had trouble walking and had to order home food . 
  i 'm opening the door , leaning heavily on my crutches , and the delivery man goes , `` hi !, 
  how are you ? '', 
  how do i answer that ? 
  `` well , gee , thanks for asking . 
  i 'm fine . 
  really . 
  looking fucking miserable is just a favorite pastime of mine , i do it for an hour every day . '', 
  do you come from or have ties to somewhere else than your flair indicate ? 
  i 'll freely admit to not knowing a whole lot about andorra , but i struggle to come up with a reason for not viewing it as an independent nation . 
  how does that even work ? 
  i knew you had a bunch of languages spoken in belgium , but i did n't know that so many people could n't understand each other because of it . 
  i mean , how do you even get something as basic as your news ? 
  are there any newspapers that are read by everyone or do you only have regional ones ? 
  i 'm not sure what 's greater when thinking about all of this : my confusion or my fascination . 
  yeah , exactly . 
  my grandmother used to have a house in the wilderness outside of jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 , and i was met with utter bewilderment when i spoke swedish around there . 
  it was especially weird since i had been able to speak swedish just fine with finns in helsinki , so i kind of assumed that that would be the case for the rest of finland as well . 
  it was a rough awakening . 
  haha !, 
  finland , for sure . 
  i was really young and it was the first time i ever visited a country where the people spoke a language i could n't understand , and where they could n't understand me . 
  sure , swedish is taught in finland , but no one spoke it where i was . 
  this was also before i knew any english , so i just could n't communicate with anyone at all . 
  it confused the shit out of my five year old brain . 
  a very weird experience . 
  it feels even weirder that it 's a neighboring country - especially since it 's the one that i nowadays would say is the one i 'm probably closest to in many ways . 
  current world champions , woooo !!!, 
  :d it 's big . 
  one of the other nordic countries ( probably denmark , but maybe finland ) or germany . 
  the only reason would be to defend myself , so if you take away the option of defending my country from an invasion there are n't really any reasons i can think of that would make me want to fight . 
  maybe in defense of some of the other nordic countries ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7umux68kte&amp;t=14 ) i 've heard people try to describe swedish in many different ways , from sounding like german to sounding like russian , but i guess that `` sing-songy '' is something that tends to come up every now and again . 
  edit : regarding english , i learned it at such a young age that i did n't really have a grasp of how it sounded before i started hearing it as part of the curriculum . 
  especially in the ( i think ) early 2000s it felt as if there were more swedish actors playing russians with horrible accents than there were swedes playing swedes or russians playing russians . 
  it was really weird . 
   if you include islands we have the 2nd longest coastline in the world , only beaten by canada . 
  that has to be relative to your size or something , right ? 
  there is no way you 're beating russia or australia otherwise .

  i 'm not sure how it 's viewed by you danes , but i remember visiting m\u00f8n when i was a teenager and being really surprised by the tall white cliffs there . 
  it was nothing like what i thought danish nature looked like , and it was breathtaking .

  while i understand that turkish might not make you understand a lot of other european languages , how is with other turkish languages ? 
  i do n't know exactly how closely related they are , but are n't the languages of uzbekistan , turkmenistan and kyrgyzstan part of the turkish language family ? 
  i would understand people thinking that if you were french , but it seems like a weird connection to make for someone who is not . 
  i mean , i would n't have thought you were a supporter of the `` sweden democrats '' party if your name had been sdzombie . 
  had you been a swede , then maybe , but otherwise it feels like an odd assumption to make . 
  interesting random fun fact : `` fn '' in swedish typically stands for * f\u00f6renta nationerna * , or the united nations . 
  does n't make me think you 're related to them in any way , though . 
  when i was a wee teen , i used to write a lot of fiction . 
  one of the things i wrote was this sci fi fantasy story , and a mysterious character in it was called terracre ( with some apostrophe in there somewhere , if i remember correctly ) . 
  it never really felt as badass as i wanted it to be and once when i misspelt it it came out as `` terrace '' , which sounded way too uncool for my mysterious alien character . 
  i tried just inverting the name , and thus `` ercarret '' was born .

   using the verb `` raped '' in this case is ridiculous and insulting to actual rape victims it simply means that there was no consent , implicit or explicit . 
  take from that what you want . 
  * that girl * . 
  it 's only only one of the women he 's accused of having raped . 
  and no , this really should n't have anything to do with wikileaks . 
  yes and it 's another quantifier . 
  far from all criminals are convicted . 
  hess did a lot more than `` extrapolate from available data '' though , so that 's hardly supporting your claim . 
  even br\u00e5 has done studies on the subject , and they have n't been condemned for hate speech as far as i know . 
  every assault rape that resulted in a conviction , and :  it 's also dangerous to try to extrapolate from available data as you can easily be condemned of hate speech . 
  i have no idea what gave you that idea , but it 's not true . 
  you ca n't compare statistics like that without taking into the difference in methodology into consideration . 
   you can call yourself whatever the fuck you want , but notice no one is sterilizing you . 
  which is also the case in all the those countries . 
  it 's when you want your * sex * changed legally ( that is , in the eyes of the state ) that you have had to change your ` sex * . 
  you can change your gender daily , and no one would care . 
  that literally says that to change your sex in our register , you have to actually change your sex . 
  notice that it 's `` sex '' and not `` gender '' . 
  it might seem unfair and necessary , but it 's far from illogical , if a bit simplistic . 
  edit : * unnecessary * !, 
  damn it . 
  facts never go out of fashion , boy . 
  it 's hard to not be self-important when you 're just so damn important . 
  yeah , i want ireland to win every year too . 
  i do n't see how not understanding the lyrics make the song less boring . 
  it 's nothing inherently interesting in languages you do n't understand . 
  maybe if you 've never heard any of them and do n't know what they sound like , there 's something to be gained from it . 
  they were in the second semi . 
  it was part of the interval act . 
  they did have a song that sounded a lot like a esc song though . 
   does n't a high risk also mean high rewards , if you pull it through that is ? 
  not generally , no . 
  you 'd be stupid to invest if it does n't though . 
  i guess so . 
  that 's not what i 'm hearing , but i ca n't say i 've delved into it , so i guess i only hear the more radical stuff . 
  that 's over a decade ago . 
  now russia has a new kind of non-western democracy , and europe represents nothing but immorality and decadence . 
  they 're classified as commodities in some countries though . 
  but there was a lot of criticism of azerbaijan two years ago when they hosted it . 
  europe can count on us to do what we do best . 
  produce weapons and steel . 
  why , yes . 
   moray eel well , it does n't fit , unless it 's been renamed correct information eel .

  that 's not an insult , it 's just the demonym for citizens of denmark . 
   evil soviet communists of russia what are you talking about ? 
  this map clearly says according to putin , and he 's no communist . 
  if he 's evil is a philosophical question . 
  i ca n't know for sure , off course , but it is the impression i 'm getting . 
  the lady doth protest too much , methinks . 
  you seem to think that the fa\u00e7ade they display outwards reflect their true feelings . 
  it 's my experience that the more eager people are to seem unfazed , the more they 're trying to hide their insecurities . 
  their bravado sounds hollow . 
  as long as they are n't planning on importing anything , they should be fine . 
  if they just had n't lost ww1 , all this could have been avoided . 
  that 's good . 
  they are targeted sanctions after all . 
  they are meant to hurt putin and his wealthy friends , not the general public . 
  some very ripe cheeses actually have a smell that 's fairly close to surstr\u00f6mming . 
  minus the fishiness off course . 
  no , the whole of europe is not dependant on russian anything . 
  far from it . 
  it 's mostly asylum seekers . 
  they are not in sweden to contribute to the economy , but to not be killed . 
  that does n't mean they 're expected to contribute of course , but it 's not primarily why they are invited . 
  you are making several mistake here , but i will limit this post to two . 
  first , you assume that all immigrants from mena countries are muslims , which is far from true . 
  the actual number is about 1.2 % . 
  secondly , you thing extrapolation actually says anything about the future . 
  it clearly does n't , or we 'd have over 100 % muslims by 2100 , which is impossible . 
  that 's what bacon is for . 
  no , but danes certainly are big on pork . 
  and pigs are electrocuted . 
  i 'm not sure about the beheading since decapitation would mean that the chicken is killed unstunned . 
  but you ca n't deny that judging sentience is a bit tricky , can you ? 
  you could try to claim that , yes , and they usually do , but it does n't change the fact that they were both technically losses . 
  russia even got more land after the winter war than they had demanded before the start of the war . 
  could be worse . 
  could also be better if all these bloody foreigners stopped projecting their dreams and butthurt onto us . 
  well we 'll see about that !, 
  \\* turns around and throws feather boa over shoulder \\*, 
  foreigners call your country a utopia . 
  you never asked for it . 
  other foreigners get upset and call your country a hell-hole . 
  you never asked for any of it . 
  a innocent bystander , used as a pawn . 
  i 've had more than one finn get upset when i point out that finland actually `` lost '' both the winter war and the continuation war . 
  it 's as if they actually did n't know that . 
  then again , finns can always strike back with the old `` you did n't help '' line , which can get quite upsetting if you do n't like it when people are wrong on the internet . 
  i 'm sorry , but not all stereotypes exist for a reason . 
  if all swedish males were in fact gay , as you finns like to claim , then we would most likely have died out , as a nation , hundreds of years ago . 
  maybe you could say that all * good * stereotypes exist for a reason . 
  people do n't seem to get what being neutral means . 
  i 'm not saying that sweden is neutral ( that 's not even the official stance ) , but selling weapons does not make you not neutral . 
  neutral is not a synonym for isolationism . 
  if the author was aiming for hypocrisy , well then he failed miserably . 
  the immigrants are not here because we need workers , they 're here because they risk being killed if they 'd stay were they were .

  the thing is that , for the state , less income is pretty much the same thing as greater expenditure . 
  he even replaced the original roof tiles with plastic ones and the original windows with bar less single glass windows . 
  i ca n't understand why somebody would do that . 
  it 's going to be pretty much impossible to restore . 
  i would have loved to move in and restore the house to its glory , but now no one ever will . 
  should be illegal . 
   as has the rate of young greeks moving abroad . 
  that would be emigrants . 
  tldr : the electricity comes from nuclear . 
  the advances in cheaper lithium batteries has been good and constant . 
  cheaper lithium batteries are why we have many more electric cars now . 
  it 's underwhelming only if you had unrealistic expectation . 
  hight capacity batteries are getting cheaper every year , and thereby closer to being able to replace gasoline , soon tax incentives wo n't be needed . 
  battery life is indeed not yet where we want it , but it 's getting closer . 
  are you thinking of the remove kebab song ? 
   naturally constrained artificially constrained ? 
  are you sure not all three relay languages are required . 
  the alternative would be that all interpreters are fluent in translating from all three languages . 
  which would require the maltese translator to be fluent in at least these three languages then . 
  you also need three translators . 
  it must be simultaneously translated into french , english and german which are the relay languages for further translation . 
  no half-arsed translations are accepted either . 
  there must be full availability for reliable translation or they do n't provide the option for translation at all . 
   we have multiple options if we leave . 
  i only see how you 're burning your bridges . 
  even a trade agreement with us would be hard for you to get without major concessions . 
  we 're not their nannies . 
  their own policies caused the problems , and you fault us for not forcing them to change their system earlier ? 
  greece and every other member state has been independent and responsible for their own economic policies . 
  this is the sort of union we are , and the sort of union greece joined . 
  the only reason we helped them at all was because it would be slightly damaging for us if they defaulted . 
  there was no compassion , nor did we in any way feel obligated . 
  it was a minor annoyance that they could n't keep their spending in check , and we blame them for not following the rules and guidance of the monetary union . 
  they held a riot outside the stadium . 
  but the russians are definitely getting the most heat for what they did inside . 
  he was arrested for not paying for the meal . 
  something he had done multiple times before . 
  yes all sources are biased to a degree . 
  a biased source might include a few good arguments . 
  these arguments could indeed possibly lead to an interesting to debate , but that would require people to swift through things such as one sided facts and straw-man arguments just to get to the few actually valid arguments ; arguments that could just as well be found in a less biased article . 
  a biased article is simply a bad read , even if people can avoid being indoctrinated by the propaganda . 
   i do n't believe you can make a balanced point without consideration of biased ones . 
  why so ? 
  biased means to misrepresent the facts to promote a side . 
  unbiased means to represent both sides in a just manor . 
  you find biased articles interesting , i do n't . 
  you 're repeating yourself because of that there is n't much to argue about . 
  i think biased articles are shit and will read balanced ones instead . 
  you can do as you please . 
  that would require me reading it . 
  i see no reason to do so . 
  i 'm sorry , but some articles are just bad . 
   not just flat out reject the entire article based on motives . 
  it 's exactly what i did . 
  there are many good and unbiased articles out there . 
  people indeed should rather read them , solely based on the fact that they are not biased as this . 
  could you fill me in ? 
  i 'm not accustomed to american politics . 
  dismissal is justified . 
  sourcing some of its facts is not enough to be respected as valid input in a debate , since even sourced and true facts can be used to mislead a reader . 
  trust in the pragmatic motives of the writer is needed , or else there is no need for people to read the article at all . 
  that the contents are clearly written and published by biased interests is very relevant critique of its contents . 
  we in sweden experimented with extremely strong welfare programs in in the 60-70s . 
  it actually had the notorious effect of some youth deciding working was n't necessary , and even made fun of people who worked as they walked by in the streets . 
  this was portrayed in a famous ( at least in sweden ) documentary called `` they call us misfits '' from 1968 . 
  he 's a simple minded fool , but quite well represents what 's wrong with swedish politics . 
  i obviously do n't . 
  you even just called me a racist , thereby proving my point . 
  do you deny that you tried to disprove me , not by bringing facts or logic , but by accusing me of being dishonest ? 
  i do n't deny that i in response used the exact same method by calling you a troll . 
  is this not so ? 
  what is it you know ? 
  tell me . 
  since you too are from sweden you should have witnessed the same events as me and know that what i have said is true . 
  although your name tells me that you 're a troll , and you just implied that what i 'm racist . 
  i wo n't take that bate . 
  can you explain ? 
  i 'm not sure what you 're arguing against . 
  what you are correct about is that the tow sides are going to the extreme ends to the spectrum , while few middle liners remain . 
  i think the right out racist sites only exist because of the lack of journalists operating in the middle ground . 
   well obviously this must be true , it 's not like germany was a special case of a population needing immigrants to make up for war dead and a burgeoning post war market ... 
  i 'm actually talking about the post war migration from germany to sweden . 
  we had the only intact industries in europe and a booming economy . 
  while germany had the expertise and labour to operate our industries , it made us the richest country in the world for a while . 
  denmark , and some other countries , have gotten quite offended from our politicians calling them racist . 
   but i think it is much more prominent on the anti side , i really do n't hear about anyone wanting nigh-unlimited immigration . 
  at worst some people go into denial , but practically no one is advocating it . 
  you can imagine it 's different in sweden . 
  the left wing parties are officially pro free immigration . 
  the other parties are unclear but tend to just say `` immigration is good '' and `` we need immigration '' , all while not being able to pass any limits ( although recent catastrophic levels have forced border controls ) . 
  there should definitely be more of a middle ground than there currently is . 
  in most debates it 's either no immigration , or it 's free immigration . 
  while most people actually agree on that the amount of immigration should be that which the society can handle without hitting certain limits , like institutions faltering as they now are in sweden , or inducing too much segregated neighbourhoods . 
  both those limits can be raised by better immigration policies and management , but both sides should recognize that they exist . 
  most all but the actual racists want immigration that is at or below this level . 
  i largely believe in paul colliers ideas on the matter . 
  i meant just want `` to reason '' . 
  to debate and talk about the effects and what level of immigration it is we actually desire before going head in to it . 
  i mean reason as in defining the reasoning behind the current levels of immigration , something that is not done today since the subject is too sensitive . 
   sadly , the opinion in europe is extremely binary on the issue .

  everything is archived . 
  that means it can take a while to sort things out , but it will be sorted . 
  meh , they chose to stay . 
  giving independence to people who do n't actually want it would be rather odd . 
   well i do n't know about the origin of the english word ... 
  but ... people just mentioned that . 
  like five times . 
  the origin of the english word `` slave '' is from the latin word `` sclavus '' , which itself came from the word the slavs used about themselves . 
  no one is saying that slavery originated from slaves being enslaved . 
  just that the word `` slave '' originated from the word `` slav '' , back in roman times . 
   oh yeah i remember all those slavs that were taken from africa ... 
  i take it you 're unfamiliar with the concept of [ etymology ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/etymology ) ? 
  the roman empire also predated the transatlantic slave trade by about two thousand years . 
  can you find any serious source saying that 's * not * the etymology ? 
   phone providers do this in the uk due to parental pressure . 
  unless those are french parents pressuring them , that 's still england doing silly things . 
  former yugoslavic republic of mesopotamia ? 
   so not only are they the cradle of western civilization , but of civilization in general . 
  that 's a bold claim . 
  i thought most of the world agreed that iraq ( i.e. 
  ancient mesopotamia ) was the cradle of civilization . 
  try scandinavia , and you 'll find pretty much the same thing . 
   surfing and beaches are an attraction regardless . 
  you do n't cross an ocean to go to the beach , though . 
  i think a lot of people from further south do n't quite realize just how big and empty the north is . 
  their idea of a forest and the swedish idea of a forest are entirely different things . 
  it 's a little bit of both . 
  there are no people or roads because the land ca n't be used for anything , which often coincides with places where travel is naturally slow ( marshes , mountains , forests ) . 
   do you want trade sanctions ? 
  considering putin is imposing his own trade sanctions ... probably yes . 
  as long as he can blame them on someone else , they can work in his favor . 
  you can always use the upcoming release of civilization : beyond earth as a reason not to play other civilization games the next two months . 
  puerto rico has a population of 3.6 million . 
  africa has a population of 1.1 billion . 
  that 's ten times more than the entirety of mexico . 
  there 's a pretty big difference in scale here . 
   i do n't know if they formed a dynasty like the normans , though . 
  [ they did ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rurik_dynasty ) . 
   if sd continues to eat votes from alliance , they might not win for a while unless they finally give up their rule of no collaboration with sd . 
  if the social democrats get to be in government for a while and are seen as not doing much either , they 'll be the ones to lose votes . 
  right now , * not * governing is possibly the best parliamentary position . 
  working with sd is going to be necessary eventually , but the first party to do it is going to get stuck in a media shit storm . 
   ... the fact that 40-50 % want less immigration ... hell , swedish media ca n't even report that statistic without going insane . 
  when reported , the `` same as now '' and `` more '' options end up grouped together to give the impression of the `` less '' option being in the minority , even if more people answered `` less '' than `` more '' . 
  it does n't even matter what a journalist actually thinks about these things . 
  for most , writing anything else is simply career suicide . 
  not one that has a majority in parliament , no . 
  they might not need that - the previous government did n't have a majority either - but it 's going to be tricky . 
  the red-green coalition from 2010 has fallen apart . 
  anders borg said right from the start that he had no interest in being in opposition . 
  he might be back if the alliance wins in four years . 
  the election results were mostly the same as four years ago , except that the moderate party lost about eight percentage points to the sweden democrats . 
  the other parties in government remained stable . 
  clearly a lot of people were very displeased with the moderates ' immigration policies . 
  that change was enough to make the social democrats the biggest party/bloc after eight years with a moderate government . 
  reinfeldt ended up resigning the same night . 
  the us is not nor has it ever been in a comparable situation . 
  mexican immigrants are at least generally literate and speak a language that a sizeable number of people in the southern us speak , and are still not very welcome . 
  they definitely have a choice . 
  the options just are n't very appealing . 
  i 'll take `` ways to lose an elections in three words '' for five hundred , alex. 
   all these people are potential scientists , geniuses all of them ? 
  really ? 
   if you ask me , i would give authorization for coastal guard or the army to use lethal force against any boat that comes to european coastal waters and tries to escape . 
  the only way to stop human trafficking is to kill the human traffickers . 
  that might just make them even more motivated to get away faster , and even less inclined to leave any living witnesses that could identify them . 
  no thanks . 
  you can keep them . 
  the fact that it 's worth it for the people on the boat does n't mean that it 's worth it for people in europe to accept those people . 
   the mess in libya is our fault . 
  the current mess , perhaps , but it was a mess before that too . 
  the whole reason we intervened was because there was already a civil war . 
  it 's not fair to lay the blame for the situation entirely on the west , because it 's been a mess for a very long time . 
   i admire your adamance in trying to present to a mule facts that it will never ever understand . 
  maybe if you actually argued the point instead of just saying `` this is how it is '' with absolutely nothing to back it up other than the fact that some random person on the internet ( i.e. 
  you ) said it , people would have an easier time understanding . 
  and it 's somehow france 's fault if african countries do n't ? 
   because europe is the destiny of these people . 
  i assume you mean destination , but still do n't see how that makes sense . 
  if i plan to travel to mongolia but get stopped in russia for not having a travel visa , is it really mongolia 's responsibility to fix it ? 
  i did n't even tell them i was coming , and if i had told them they would probably have recommended that i either apply for a visa or stay at home . 
  it 's kind of hard to fight during winter due to the snow , and the farmers had to be home during spring and autumn . 
  further south , i think winter was the season for war . 
   do you really , really think v\u00e4nstern voters publicly picked up sd 's ballots ? 
  if yes , i think we 're done talking . 
  do you have any experience at all with what voters actually do , or are you just trying to argue against me based on assumptions ? 
  because i 've worked in the last seven swedish elections and do n't have to actually assume or believe anything . 
  i 've seen what people actually do at the ballot stands . 
  i 've seen how many sd ballots get used up during an election and i 've counted the votes at the end of the day and seen how many ended up being used . 
   interesting how your familiarity does n't extend itself to acknowledging your fellow swedes in this thread . 
  check the edit . 
  they 're simply mistaken . 
  when the majority of voters grab multiple ballots , there ca n't really be any stigma attached to grabbing multiple ballots . 
  people just get paranoid about being judged when they do n't realize that everyone else also does the exact same thing , regardless of who they vote for . 
   in fact , there 's a lot of this bully mentality about people who vote for sd . 
  is that normal in sweden ? 
  unfortunately , yes , but that has nothing to do with the election system . 
  again , you can just grab a blank ballot and write any party you want on it , or even grab a party ballot and cross out the name to write in a new one . 
  votes are counted manually ( all open to the public ) , so you can improvise if you want . 
  and perceiving sd as the village idiot does n't change the reality of them having 49 seats in parliament now .

  unfortunately , the point of this argument is to be able to claim that 1 . 
  there are 0 legitimate refugees coming to germany , sweden , etc 2 . 
  the doors for all illegal migrants should be closed , no exceptions . 
  is it , even if you have not been granted asylum , and you have no rights ? 
  haha . 
  yeah . 
  i 'm sure i 'm seen as a left-wing guy by many here , but that it 's nuts , and i 've never seen such a comment . 
  in sweden , `` political refugee '' is only used to contrast someone who is fleeing war . 
  the whole notion that you 're allowed to flee poverty does not exist in sweden , unfortunately it 's very hard to deport people , so it 's difficult to keep up this distinction . 
  our experience with moroccans , etc , coming here illegally has been quite bad . 
  `` romanian roma '' would have been more clear . 
  did i indicate i do n't know this ? 
  still , the roma beggars in sweden have families left back in romanian and bulgaria . 
  there are swedish roma too - but they do n't sit in front of supermarkets . 
  again , that 's 4 years !, 
  and a positive development . 
  over the last 20 years , poland have increased its trade with the eu many times and there has been great economic development , and modal wages are significantly up . 
  when you hear pis , they talk as if everything has been shit the last 10-20 years and they are going to purge poland from evil foreign influences . 
  can you give me evidence that the median salary has n't changed the last 20 years ? 
  the average salary in poland has gone up about 200 % in that time . 
  if you look at short periods ( 3-4 years ) it is n't that fair . 
  and i was mostly annoyed by her argument . 
  poland was significantly poorer than the rest of europe before , and if you can double or triple your earnings by going abroad , many will be tempted , even if the local economy is doing well . 
  for example , there are jobs in many parts of romania and the romanian economy is improving , but many roma still go abroad to beg - because then they can make 30-50 % more on average . 
  i heard a polish woman who supported pis on swedish radio a few weeks ago . 
  everything she said was completely unsubstantial . 
  things like `` they are lying when they claim that poland has been doing well economically the last 15 year - they are lying with the statistics . 
  why would any pole leave poland to go work abroad if we were doing well ? '', 
  she gave me nightmares . 
  yeah , those strawberries are one of the few sorts of produce we eat in season . 
  also , having your own apple tree is good , some sorts are tasty but too small to sell . 
  yes and no . 
  the best cooking is quite good , affordable food is varying a lot in quality with most being quite bland . 
  wrapped in bacon ? 
  all that pork has to go * somewhere * . 
  i think you missed my point - the numbers i wrote were entirely made up , not facts . 
  which republican presidential candidate will work to curb co2 more , donald trump or ted cruz ? 
   actually ukraine opposes gay marriage more strongly than russia does huh ? 
  92 % compared to 91 % ? 
  gay marriage is eons away in both countries . 
  in russia doubly so , since it 's seen as western european degeneracy . 
  republicans and democrats are both quite divided on how to do foreign policy , and this is especially clear regarding the attitude towards russia . 
  no , i 'm saying that blaming the us for decisions in the 50 's is pointless today . 
  hey , i 'm pissed at the us for the invasion of iraq in 2003 , which further destabilized the region , but that anger is n't helping anyone . 
  back then everything was about the super-power competition with soviet . 
  a lot of bad things happened . 
  soviet forced eastern europe to stay under its boot , the us did similar things in south america and asia . 
  and the soviet occupation of afghanistan had similar ambitions - to prop up an ally . 
  yeah , do n't get your hopes up about trump , he 'll happily give russia half of ukraine in exchange for some oil/gas collaboration . 
  yup - and homophobia in ukraine is not as bad as it is in russia , but it 's basically the same attitudes sans the official - anti-homo legislation . 
  youth gangs that engage in theft and robbery have made the national news many times . 
  many comments in this thread are proposing to ban a major religion from their countries , in a reaction much like knee-jerk death punishment proposals . 
  yes . 
  but reading this thread , one would think that that is what / r/europe would want to do away with . 
  your second paragraph has nothing to do with merkel , and simply points out your lack of reasoning facilities . 
  yeah , lets airdrop food and tents on aleppo , i 'm sure that will help !, 
  arrested in eritrea often means slave labor for the rest of your life . 
  it 's not called the `` north korea of africa '' for naught . 
  it 's illegal for eritrean officials to hunt down swedish citizens to pay eritrean tax . 
  they do try , but it 's not sanctioned by the swedish state at all . 
  theft and burglary was never national news . 
  small towns in sweden are often kind of lame . 
  but even places like nyk\u00f6ping have * something * . 
  yup 95 % roma of romanian ( and bulgarian ) origin . 
  what i meant by `` does n't work anymore '' is that they have to provide the man with his own space . 
  this is all silly an archaic , but it 's the only way women can come together and practice their religion without having someone interpreting it for them . 
  name five apostasy killings in europe . 
  and in this thread there are obviously a few hundred uninformed men , debating the issue from a position of ignorance and malice . 
  absolutely amazing that no-one in this thread even understands the point . 
  mandated gender segregation in mosques makes this move entirely logical . 
  once they let even one man in , it does n't work any more . 
  so i think this is a bit weird too , but it 's definitely a step in the right direction . 
  honor killings are rarely ( if ever ) related to apostasy . 
  i 'm sure murder for apostasy is so rare in europe you cancount the instances on one hand . 
  even in sweden , some protestants are still against women priests , and have formed organisations to preserve conservative christian ideas . 
  freedom of religion is a quaint luxury we ca n't afford !, 
  the article has some good , nuanced points , while being full of small blunders and mistakes . 
  as for parental leave , yes , immigrants qualify , but if they do n't have registered a decent salary ( sgi ) , they wo n't get much ( 180 sek per day ) . 
  if other people in their household are pulling in good money , it will certainly be a nice bonus , but alone , parental leave without sgi will not bring in more cash than living on welfare . 
  why would it be the richest ? 
  small countries tend to vary more in gdp per capita than larger , for obvious statistical reasons . 
  a country of one person would also be 100 % dependent on foreign trade - or a hermit with negligible means . 
  childcare has been expanded , but cultural expectations and joint taxation are still in the way . 
  i do n't know how domestic german men are - in japan it 's definitely a factor that many young men still expect women to do 100 % of the housework . 
  well , that 's good . 
  is n't that pretty recent , though ? 
  combining a 70h/week career climbing phase with family is very hard . 
  a family i know where they did this had a sister of the mother work as a nanny . 
  another i know of had a canadian maid . 
  combining a more `` normal '' career with family is fully possible . 
  we 're doing it at home , a friend of mine is in the 99th percentile while his wife is in the 95th percentile - without nanny or any help . 
  maybe they have a 2h/week cleaning service , at most . 
  by that logic , the richest country should always consist of one person . 
  once you add another , they have to compete . 
  an economy encompasses all people . 
  if you add people , you also add demand for labor . 
  germany sucks for combining career with children , however . 
  if you have children you should be a hausfrau . 
  joint taxation does n't make it easier . 
  joint taxation and full-price childcare is enough to prevent a significant number of mother from having jobs .

  i see i see . 
  horrible to see people so on edge, 
  i heard it from my friend like 30 minutes ago , apparently someone threw a banger and it caused panic ? 
  some people are so stupid ... 
  it does so, 
  why not ? 
  spain is a very rich country , be happy for poland !, 
  even turkey is more sensible than us in this regard jesus christ, 
  are there alcohol in the supermarkets in turkey ? 
  we do n't have the same `` campus '' structure atleast in sweden . 
  the humanities are surely as retarded here as in the us but no one cares because they are holed up in their own building , just as the rest of us are holed up in our own buildings . 
  what they do do n't matter to the rest because we are here to study after all not play politics or whatever . 
  i did study humaniora 6 months and it was horrible lmao . 
  no we 're not . 
  us has a lot of flaws but it 's still the shit . 
  why on earth would someone go to estonia for girls when there are italian girls right next to them ? 
  you do n't paint your icons in gay colours during liturgy ? 
  fucking mother country abandoing all our traditions ... 
  yeah , everyone knows your name is mehmet, 
  well no one goes shopping in the middle of the day either . 
  not everyone is a farmer , just stay inside during the day and go outside in the morning/evening, 
  why would this have anything to do with anti racism ? 
  it is racism pure and simple . 
  could we stop pretending racism is something only europeans do , 500 years of turkish oppression , slavery and rapes of balkanic peoples would like to disagree, 
  not really !, 
  i do n't feel i get as much out of my tax money as some danes here say . 
  my education was awful ( and sweden is under the oecd median ) , the healthcare system is an absolute mess ( i study medicine and my girlfirends parents are both doctors so i have some insight in this ) , i absolutely do not feel secure here ; there have been multiple cases of gang rape in my small town of like 200.000 people , even in the centrum !, 
  do you think i feel safe with my girlfrend walking alone to the central station when there are gangs of gypsies roaming around and moroccan street children living in the tunnels below ? 
  no thank you it is not worth it , i want out of here . 
  the bus system and stuff is pretty great though, 
  i 've been to florida in the summer , was not so bad , 30-35c is totally tolerable , it is when you get to above 40 it gets real bad, 
  well yes of course the winter is what i am talking about :p, 
  people always want what they do n't have . 
  i will gladly change places with you , even though it 's pretty nice with 25c where i am atm, 
  i always hear this but i never agree . 
  i have spent most my summers in extreme greek heat and yeah it can be a pain but cold as fuck is a loot worse . 
  does n't matter if i put on a lot of clothes and heat up my house , it is still only artificial warmth and i still feel cold inside , and all my freedom is gone since i ca n't just go out without insulating myself and walking like a penguin , getting snow in my shoes unless i walk in some enormous boots etc. 
  it 's such a hassle but to each their own !, 
   edit : oh yeah , and it is dark.all.the.time . 
  which is just so depressing it 's indescribable, 
  yeah true , the mines right ? 
  people must be very weird to voluntarily live there, 
  people who are not refugees can easily act like it and get protection we should n't have to give them 2 . 
  no one should be considered refugee if they are not in the 1st safe country next to the warzone they are from, 
  yes, 
  i do n't agree, 
  if it 's made for different times then it should be ammended obviously ? 
  just like the refugee laws that were made in the 50s are n't applicable to our days . 
  not all laws are set in stone , and thank god for that else we 'd have a lot of outdated laws still in effect, 
  yes , the mexicans are surely stopping their border crossing because education is getting worse in the us ... what some european phd students do is irrelevant when it comes to illegal border crossings into the us, 
  which is pretty insane imo, 
  well he is doing a pretty shit job if that is his objective :p, 
  trump is n't really `` no foreigners please '' either , both sides are exaggerated to make it easier to understand, 
  yes , let 's shield a million people from the most sexist and racist places in the world , i 'm sure their morals are all fine and dandy , and then turn our back to the polish who still in a global sense are very liberal . . why are you a racist scumbag who hates poland ? 
  yeah , i think actual religion is very dead in europe , religion is coming back in some societies but it is going to be tied to nationalism , like in russia/serbia/greece etc. 
  i think mr greek is talking about industrial countries . 
  in 3rd world non industrialised countries yes more poverty = more children . 
  in the 1st world this is not true though . 
  sweden/france/uk etc. 
  tend to have higher birthrates ( even if you discount the immigrants driving it up a bit ) than for example greece or eastern europe , where there is economic turmoil at the moment, 
  condoms are shit though , pills are much better, 
  europeans then, 
  check his flair , see that he is swedish , report him for spam . 
  rinse and repeat, 
   whose regime kills infants every single day ehh ? 
  as if we do n't always do that haha, 
  i know many anarchists in greece and they 're not the kind of people you 'd want on your side to create a good society . 
  they enjoy violence for the sake of violence and go riot and then complain how unfairly they are treated by police the next day . 
  their literal goal is to bring down the state , how can they not be considered idiots ? 
  no only nazis are nazi , anarchist are anarchist . 
  i 'm just saying they suck, 
  their ulterior motives are still shit and they should be treated like shit . 
  \u03c7p\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b1\u03c5\u03b3\u03b7 did the same and they are still nazi shitheads, 
  never said that lol , why was i downvoted ? 
  meh , many of us who grew up middle class do n't feel swedish either, 
  but he is half european , looks like a european , is born in europe , talks a european language as his mothertongue - why is he more of a non european than a european ? 
  to the rest of the world there is zero difference between you and british people sorry . 
  just like norwegians and swedes are the same people, 
  i 'll never get how you anglos count race, 
  ah i see , thought you were the same guy sorry, 
  that does n't make him non white lol, 
  what ? 
  he looks extremely white in the picture, 
  oh get over yourself you big baby, 
  in my experience people do n't know much about greece other than the resorts they have visited so it is very much western europe in their minds, 
  definitely !, 
  i remember having an iraqi friend home for dinner as a kid and him blurting out `` how did you learn to make arabic food ?? '', 
  to my mother haha, 
  makes sense !, 
  ehh ask random people on the street and i bet most of them would call greece part of western europe . 
  but you have a point , greece is west , balkan , south , east all at the same time, 
  haha , no way westerners have it in them to put someone in the hospital , black or white, 
  why is greece such an outlier compared to the rest of the west ? 
  the first time sure , he is at fault for being the aggressor . 
  the 2nd time you should 've been more wary . 
  the 3rd time you 've made yourself a victim by not standing up for yourself . 
  the first time sure , he is at fault for being the aggressor . 
  the 2nd time you should 've been more wary . 
  the 3rd time you 've made yourself a victim by not standing up for yourself . 
  the first time sure , he is at fault for being the aggressor .

it 's not . 
  maybe a small one in per capita statistics of sovereign entities , but online bragging rights is a silly reason to not do things . 
  if that 's what you wanted , almost all capitals would have an upgrade in living standards and wages if they just left the rest of the country behind . 
  in op you can see how it 'd benefit . 
  a unified nordics would have a stronger voice in global matters and it 'd create a more attractive market . 
  i 'm not saying it 's a good idea for norwegians and there are other issues one may have , but a unification would n't be any downgrade in living standards and wages . 
  the issue is with that is how it can become democratically lopsided , since i 'm assuming we 'd want to stay a democracy . 
  it would n't be the first union where there was contempt between the most powerful ( in terms of voting power ) country and others . 
  sweden would get 37 % of the votes alone , while icelanders only account for 1,3 % . 
  to get around it you could weigh the votes differently , but then you then you end up giving individual icelanders a lot more voting power and swedes notably less . 
  and by weighing votes differently you may end up with a trump situation where the most voted for alternative does n't win , which also brings contempt . 
  it 's difficult to find a good balance when the population distribution is uneven . 
  it 's not the biggest issue in forming a union , but it 's not inadmissible . 
  yeah , i was n't sure where the schleswig stuff border went . 
  and iirc shetland and orkney became scottish during the kalmar union so i do n't know if that 'd count . 
   do not think anyone considered living on svalbard this far back . 
  i mean there were settlements up there for whaling purposes pretty far back , but that started after the kalmar union in the 1600s . 
  pretty unlikely . 
  the population distribution is pretty uneven . 
  denmark , norway and finland have fairly similar population numbers , but sweden is almost twice as big and iceland less than a tenth of the three . 
  finland is n't too keen on being one with sweden again afaik , and iceland and norway literally `` broke free '' from being in unions the remaining two not * too * long ago . 
  there 's he 3-2 split on the question of eu . 
  another 3-2 split on the question of nato . 
  a third 3-2 split on forms of government . 
  our military has seen better days , ok ? 
  yes . 
  if you actually wanted the land covered by the kalmar union you 'd probably want to replace a fair share of the northern areas of sweden and finland , and svalbard with schleswig , shetland , and orkney . 
  or something . 
  i ca n't remember exactly where the borders went . 
  sure , greenland is technically an autonomous , constituent country without it , but i meant the sovereign states . 
  to me it looks bad how the left part of the horizontal bar is in a bold kufic script and the right in a much lighter thuluth . 
  it looks odd . 
  i mean , i get they copy-pasted the parts from the saudi and iranian flags respectively , but it 'd look so much better if both sides had the same calligraphy or were at least somewhat similar weight . 
  iirc it was made to make fun of t_d . 
   scotland is still represented by the white `` x '' or saltire is still on the flag representing scotland it 's not . 
  those are just fimbriations you need in heraldry and vexillology to abide the rule of tincture . 
  it 's what most of the white stuff on the union flag is and it 's why there 's white on the outside of st. patrick 's saltire too . 
  [ all the yellow here are fimbrations ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rgvnmle.png ) , st. andrew 's cross is just the white part . 
  the flag in op is n't asymmetrical as the current one as st. andrew 's cross is gone . 
  scandinavian cross = nordic cross . 
  they 're synonyms . 
  its use spread from scandinavia -- hence scandinavian . 
  it 's used across the nordics -- hence nordic . 
  both are right . 
  `` nordic '' is generally preferred as the non-scandinavian nordic countries also have it , but that does n't make it `` not scandinavian '' . 
  it is also called a scandinavian cross , so you would n't have been wrong even if you had said that . 
  but nordic is used more nowadays since the non-scandinavian nordic countries also have it . 
  oh , i thought you meant that you wrote it in english , so yes . 
  but how are you writing * `` how do i '' * in swedish ... ? 
  but yeah , google does n't just customize result based on the country level . 
  a lot of stuff affects your number one , that 's not `` the first one for sweden '' . 
  when i tried it in a private window i got `` how do i live '' , which makes sense as according to google trends it 's ranked 2nd worldwide on related queries to `` how do i '' . 
  but yes , this is with 99 % certainty utter bullshit . 
  yeah ... 
  pretty sure it 's utter bullshit , nothing about making friends is anywhere on the list of related queries on google trends for sweden . 
  even if you tried to do it properly i do n't really understand how you 'd even compile this . 
  either you do it in english in all countries , which wo n't really give good results for natives of most countries , or differences in language are going to come in the way to be accurate . 
  you ca n't say `` how do i [ verb ] ... '' in swedish for example , you say `` how [ verb ] i. . . '' , which is n't as limited . 
   the rule for a region to be included , is that the country is in europe , it has an iso 3166 code , it has an actual flag ( not a coat of arms ) and somebody has requested it . 
  does that mean we can get the flags of the swedish counties ? 
  i mean , in a perfect world i 'd prefer the elongated variant that is n't so square , but i assume you 're going by what 's on paper with stuff like that . 
  well , to be honest , in a perfect world i 'd want the [ flag of sm\u00e5land ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/flag_of_sm%c3%a5land.svg/640px-flag_of_sm%c3%a5land.svg.png ) but that 's both unofficial and not of a administrative region , so i assume that 's already off the table . 
  but for that lion : - sweden 's undoubtedly in europe . 
  - [ iso code ] ( https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:se ) for kronoberg is ` se-g ` / ` se-07 ` . 
  - it 's the officially declared flag . 
  - i am hereby requesting it . 
   castrate the floppy dick that is sweden russia did that in 1809, 
  the swedish selection contest , * melodifestivalen * , is larger than * esc * in sweden by numbers of viewers . 
  it is the more important contest of the two here . 
  that 's true , i am wooshing pretty hard on where the humor is . 
  for the record i still am , i do n't get it . 
  but i must admit my reply has more to do with it amusing me to respond to moronic shit with needlessly exhaustive replies . 
  it 's a character flaw . 
   probably wrote the last names wrong . 
  skarsg\u00e5rd has an * \u00e5 * . 
  but ... if required for international purposes the * \u00e5 * would typically be replaced with an * a * . 
  i ca n't quite merit you an a , but i 'll give you a b. , 
  0.08779 % of men are called mohamed in sweden . 
  0.35 % if you include all spelling variations . 
  it 's not in the top 50 . 
  if you 're interested in common men 's names in sweden , the top 10 ( incl . 
  spelling variations ) are in order : * karl , erik , lars , anders , per , mikael , johan , olof , nils * , and * jan * .

   kanken do you mean k\u00e5nken , as in the backpack ? 
  is that well known in poland ? 
   ( napoleon times and so on ) yeah , jean-baptiste was a marshal of france under napoleon . 
  the two had a pretty turbulent relationship . 
  if you look close you 'll find napoleon 's imperial eagle on the coat of arms of sweden . 
  i swear i stared at it forever trying to place it , but could n't come up with anything . 
  sounded like an ngo or charity or something . 
  thought it was weird that i 'd never even heard of it if it was that well-known in bulgaria ... 
  i 'm dumb . 
  haha, 
  what 's idea ? 
  sweden did n't invent finland . 
  when that area was swedish , it was simply the eastern part of the sweden proper , a part like any other . 
  the only `` finland '' we had was the eponymous province in the southwest . 
  the thing we now call finland came to be when the russians conquered * \u00d6sterland * and part of * norrland * . 
  that sure was n't a swedish choice . 
  finland sprung to existence after the russians chopped sweden in half and the finns eventually made it theirs .

  thinking that the entire problem is that natives do n't offer enough chances to integrate is just as useless as thinking that the immigrants are entirely at fault . 
  maybe the problem is n't that people are n't doing * enough * , but that they 're simply putting a lot of effort into the wrong things ? 
   it just shows you can not trust politicians . 
  or that you can make any politician seem untrustworthy if you take an old quote and compare it to a recent action , while ignoring the fact that official policy has changed since that statement . 
  just countries lead by mma fighters . 
  i 'm not sure if that would be an improvement . 
  the top two countries per capita ( netherlands and russia ) got that high because of planes that were intentionally brought down , so it 's not entirely useful , no . 
  just kind of interesting . 
  definitely . 
  while the russian numbers are bad , they 're not * that * bad . 
  per capita , the number is only 20 % higher than france and 30 % higher than spain . 
  the netherlands number per capita is actually more than twice that of russia . 
  they left with free dirt . 
  that 's not too bad . 
  it has some unnecessary restrictions , though . 
  there 's no reason to limit it to italian wine ; we only care about italy because it randomly happened there . 
  there 's no reason to limit it to wine ; we only care about wine because it randomly happened to a bottle of it . 
  there 's no reason to care about jews in particular ; any other racist , sexist , or otherwise offensive phrase would have had the same effect . 
  in the end , it 's pretty likely that a whole bunch of bottles ( or any other container , item , whatever ) out there have some kind of inappropriate randomly generated text on them . 
  no , but the only reason we care about chianti is that the bottle that ended up saying dirtyjew was a chianti bottle . 
  had it been anything else , we would be asking about the probability of that instead . 
  kind of like how it could just as well have said filthyjew or uncleanjew , but we 're not interested in that since it has n't happened . 
  it 's a very common phenomenon in statistics . 
  it 's possibly the highest quality post all month . 
  deport the parents . 
  they 're the real victims here . 
  ^ ^ wait ... 
  the graph is still good for the countries that are actually in it . 
  and by `` party hard '' i assume you mean get really drunk in the sauna without anyone saying a word ? 
   and it infringes on our copyrighted term . 
  i think the italians might have something to say about that . 
  the point would presumably be to change `` a few '' to `` all '' . 
  on paper . 
  in practice , they 're ** very ** far away from actual membership . 
  turkey 's human rights record is far too lousy . 
  their high population would also give them a lot of influence , which makes other large countries wary of losing influence if turkey joins . 
  add tensions with greece and disagreements over cyprus , and it 's just not happening in the next ten years . 
  to be fair , america is a sample . 
  the french supplied the american revolutionaries with large amounts of ammunition while french military strategists coincidentally went on `` vacation '' there . 
  not because they had any interest in whether the colonies gained independence , but mostly because they really did n't like the british . 
  it worked out * extremely * well in the end , with the americans returning the favor and liberating france during ww2 . 
  that 's what the internet does to media . 
  when readers pay ( indirectly through ads ) per article rather than a yearly subscription , journalists need to write lots of articles that people will read ( or at least click the link to ) . 
  in the past a newspaper could justify the subscription cost by having a few * really * good articles every month , but that just does n't pay the bills anymore . 
  there 's often one capable figurehead from each party to get votes , then the rest gets filled up by people who are too incompetent to have a domestic political career but who still want to get paid . 
  fell asleep on the train and missed their station . 
  eight hours later , they woke up in skellefte\u00e5 . 
  lots of countries are . 
  it 's just not really newsworthy right now , considering recent events and the fact that everyone did the same thing . 
  not very likely , but better safe than sunk . 
  polling data for sd tends to be very unreliable , unfortunately . 
  for random phone polls , people often lie about voting for them resulting in lower-than-actual figures , and for online polls their supporters tend to be more active and ending up overrepresented . 
  the only time there are ever any accurate numbers for sd is the day after election day . 
   they 're more judicious shots then the standard arab guerrillas . 
  does n't matter . 
  the police supposedly fired 5000 shots during one of the raids following the paris attacks . 
  as long as you have ammo , firing more is generally better . 
  much of the time you 're more worried about pinning the enemy down so you or someone else can get into position , and less about whether you 're actually hitting anything . 
  there are plenty of rpg launchers in the region already . 
  the problem is usually getting ammunition for them . 
  that goes double for missile launchers . 
  just be warned that the fuel efficiency and ( non-cannon-related ) safety are n't very big concerns when designing armored vehicles , so they cost a fortune to drive and are surprisingly unsafe if you get into an accident . 
  the vehicle will be fine , but you wo n't . 
   ... eat `` military '' food like pea soup . 
  sounds very genuine . 
  when i was in the army , we had pea soup once per week . 
  it 's easy to make enormous amounts of it and still have it taste good , so it 's perfect for field kitchens . 
  it takes a lot of time , but very little actual work . 
  surely a mastermind would n't have gotten himself killed . 
  proof that he 's just a paltry ringleader . 
  considerably fewer warlords , though . 
   we 've been dysfunctional in several areas for decades , most notably justice . 
  dysfunctional is not the same as failed . 
  it 's not like belgium is a european version of somalia . 
   anonymous is a joke that started on 4chan ... 
  it started based on a comic book antihero , sure , but along the way it became a serious movement . 
  maybe not the most effective movement , but `` they '' actually do real things on occasion . 
  certainly more than most other decentralized or anarchistic movements . 
  as far as the locals living in the sun are concerned , it might be . 
  you should learn from barcelona . 
  everything in the city is in at least two languages , including restaurant menus . 
  if they want to be helpful towards tourists , you 'll often see signs in five or six languages . 
  it makes sense in academia . 
  they probably never intended to come to france , just to that university which happened to be located in france , and they likely do n't plan to stay once they 're done . 
   sweden is nearly 20 % people of foreign origin ... 
  most of them are european . 
  finnish , danish , polish and large numbers who came here from the balkans during the war . 
  immigrants from the middle east is a relatively new thing . 
  there are certainly radicals , but not that many of them today . 
   this looks like something that a few guys with access to basement + pen + paper + innocuous internet searches would be able to do in a few evenings . 
  things tend to seem easier on paper , though . 
  hosting a dinner for 200 people does n't * seem * that different from hosting a dinner for 5 people , assuming you have others to help . 
  in practice , you need to do * everything * differently and you 're going to have whole new * kinds * of problems . 
  it 's nothing new . 
  it 's just more visible due to recent events . 
   and why do n't you have laws against begging ? 
  it 's suggested all the time , but would hurt other people ( i.e. 
  homeless ) too . 
  these people are also less annoying than people trying to collect charitable donations , because at least the foreign beggars wo n't try to talk to you or follow you if you just walk past them . 
  so no one cares very much .

  i was not being sarcastic , i just do n't really belive it until i see it . 
  i do n't really mind the us 's ( in my mind ) weird gun laws , lack of health care , putting people in prison all the time , death penalty etc , because even if i might not agree with it , it is something the us mainly do to itself . 
  however , with the military complex ( as with environmental policy for example ) the us messes up the life of everybody on the planet . 
  now , if the current military complex stays , the us needs a new war to justify those costs . 
  and , the true cost of the next war will not be carried by the us , it will be carried by the unfortunate state that was next on the list and a lot of other states who managed to be dragged into it , by accident/taking in the refugees/being neighbours/having the same religion etc. 
  and i do n't want that . 
  not at all . 
  also , i genuinely think those money could be so much better spent on education , welfare , environment , research etc - there are a lot of worthy causes that will increase us and the us populations quality of life . 
  cool . 
  i really think that is good for you . 
  so your congress said yes to the budget ? 
  i thought it was n't finished , just extended until january ( when the next shutting down of the government might happen ) . 
  is n't that right ? 
   yea they are currently cutting spending , the sequester cuts are already underway for 2013 and it will need to be renewed every year ; but these cuts are growing in popularity . 
  `` the defense bugdet is facing $ 492 billion in possible sequester cuts over nine years , or roughly $ 55 billion annually . 
  these come on top of earlier cuts by former defense secretary robert gates '' * if * it is true ( as in , it will be voted through ) , i 'd say that is great . 
  those money are needed elsewhere , and it is not like china is going to invade the us if they spend 1 % less . 
  however , i do n't belive the congress is going to pass it , there are new elections and who wants to be the non patriot who cuts spending etc. ... . but , one can always hope . 
   i have chilean and persian friends ( lots of persian friends , in fact ) that would argue we did n't fuck over their countries . 
  it 's a matter of perspective . 
  these things are complicated , not black and white . 
  there were 2 democratic elected government you choose to overturn . 
  and you defend that . 
  seriously , are you saying it was right to overthrow allende ? 
  yes or no . 
  was the iranian coup d'etat in 1953 right ? 
  are you that self centered ? 
  why was it right then ? 
  explain !, 
  why are you right killing children with drones , nsa , iraq , nicauragua , lumumba ? 
   we did n't start vietnam or korea . 
  we joined in . 
  semantics , like the first gulf war . 
  it was fought and lead by you , do n't you deny it . 
  ( mcnamara/tonkin , really , you are suck a lovely state ... ) should you have been in vietnam ? 
  what were you doing there , egging it on ? 
  it was a war , driven by you , even your own presidents , foreign secretaries etc admits to it . 
  are you denying it then ? 
  shall i head over to / r/askhistorians and tell them that there is an idiot here who claims that the us were just `` helping out a tad '' in the vietnam war and it was all the fault of the french ? 
  are you denying that yousupplied weapons , and fought a war ? 
  are you denying that you prolonged it and help cause millions of dead ? 
  are you btw denying the bombings of laos and cambodja ? 
   the u.s. is not responsible for the civil war . 
  if any outside force was responsible for the war it was french colonialism . 
  oh , please !, 
  you did n't have to be there . 
  why were you there ? 
  the french had left . 
  you just need a war every decade . 
  a you are the worst kind , really . 
  seriously , the more i communicate with you the more i understand what an asshole and blind patriot you are . 
  you defend shooting people , murdering millions of them , bombing of civilians , changing borders , destroyed countries and overturning democracies . 
  that is so fucked up and cruel . 
  and to top it of , after all the millions of dead you have caused , * you * have the narcissistic nerver to complain about * your * suffering . 
  could you possibly be more self centered ? 
  `` buhu , we invade countries and while killing peasants they sometime shoot back and i stubbed my toe , or at least someone in my family did , buhu '' . 
  i think that is the most narcisstic rant i have ever heard . 
  you do n't have to be in wars you are in , you go in because you are power hungry cunts and then you complain . 
   not as many that died because of north vietnamese . 
  so just as many would have died had you not entered ? 
  the fact that you were there for 10 + years and started the war had nothing to do with it ? 
  that you trained the south vietnamese , gave them weapons , and yes , fought with them ? 
  just as many would have died and the war would have been just as long ? 
  bullshit of course . 
   i never said i was morally superior to you , or anyone . 
  vietnam is a sore spot for me yes , you did lecture me , and everyone else . 
  so , it was a stupid war unlike what - the glorious fight you have just fought in iraq when you kill peasants by the thousands ? 
   education spending in the us comes primarily from state and local governments , not the federal government . 
  again , you do n't know what the fuck you 're talking about . 
  sigh , you really do n't even manage to understand a bit about it do n't you . 
  in many , many states you are cutting it back , all the while constantly voting to keep war people like bush nr 2 in office , or why not the always peace loving tea party members in office . 
  you could of course vote for less spending on the military , and a certain minimum standards in schools , or support from the federal government or something , to make sure one keep the education up ... . not very likely that you do that , but you see , a lot of other countries think that way , if a school get to little and the results are to bad , it needs help , even if it is from the state ... germany for example give extra money to states that are to poor , to guarantee a minimum standard . 
  i guess you want to stay low on the oecd ranking though , keep them dumb . 
   vietnam is a sore spot for me get over it . 
  i serb lives with croats here , russians with estonians , you can fucking get over a war you were never in . 
   it was a stupid , horrible war , but i do n't appreciate being lectured to about it by someone who has no fucking connection to it . 
  i live close to a large community of vietnamese refugees who would tell you the same fucking thing , but perhaps b i do n't appreciate being lectured about wars , dictatorship from someone who fucking starts most of them , and then claim that * they * suffer . 
  why do you start the wars then ? 
  stop starting them , and we will stop lecturing them . 
  oh , and today i spoke to an iraq refugee , you know , the ones you do n't accept after fucking up their country completely . 
  i have a chilean and a iranian friend too . 
  please , explain to them , why you fucked up their countries !, 
  and , you , and your country is unlike me responsible for suffering in vietnam and iraq . 
  so , if you want to blame someone , look yourself in the mirror and ask * still * why you want to spend so much on the military , if you really could n't cut back . 
  i guess that sort of soul searching is to much for you however . 
   first of all , do n't lecture me on vietnam . 
  i have family members who died fighting that war , and i have vietnamese friends who had family members died , and others who spent years in `` reeducation camps '' after the war . 
  i can and i will . 
  wtf were you doing there !, 
  just another example how you just bring war and destruction on the planet , and do care about democracy , freedom , and how many get killed ( as long as it is not americans , that is the * only * thing you care about ) . 
  how many vietnamese people dies because of you ? 
  how many iraq people ? 
  why did you help force democratic elected presidents from power in iran , chile and other countries ? 
  tell , me , why * should n't * i lecture you ? 
  you behave like idiots most of the time , but accotding to * you * just because * you * have a relative there - * you * should n't be critiscised . 
  it is so narcissistic that i can hardly grasp it . 
  explain to me again in detail , why the us should escape criscism from behaving like cunts just because you have relatives somewhere . 
   assuming you 're swede who grew up in sweden , you have no clue what it 's like for your country , friends , and family to be involved in a war , and the sacrifices it entails . 
  again , so fucking us centric . 
  a ) just because you have relatives in a war does n't mean that you have suffered .

  yes !, 
  loved that game . 
  the song fit it perfectly . 
  but what do you mean with your highlights of the chorus ? 
  i feel like i 'm missing something . 
  that 's an interesting idea , had n't thought of it that way . 
  * whatever do you [ mean ] ( http://i.imgur.com/g2dqgr5.jpg ) !? 
  on a more serious note , there are a lot of cool cats from turkey in sweden , so you 're more than welcome to come here and invade our personal space . 
  at least an itsy bitsy bit . 
  thanks for the tips !, 
  a few questions , though . 
  travelers is the netflix series , right ? 
  i think i saw something about them doing a time travel series , but have n't checked it out yet . 
  i did begin to watch frequency . 
  interesting premise/first episode . 
  i 'll probably return to it , but i might wait until the first season is done so that i can binge it . 
  `` dallas ' 63 '' sounds like an alternative title for the stephen king book about a guy who travels back in time to stop the assassination of jfk . 
  would that be correct ? 
  really liked the book , but accidentally missed the tv series when it ran earlier . 
  might have to check if it 's on some streaming service here . 
  and lastly , timeless . 
  have n't heard of that at all . 
  what is it ? 
  while i am half-german , i do n't consider german to be my native language since i a ) only learned it as a third language in school , and b ) am shit at it . 
  therefor rammstein is a given . 
  i have too many favorite songs to list , but maybe [ spieluhr ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerdrmkmwu0 ) ? 
  but if i am to choose a song sung in a language i do n't know at all , i 'll probably go with [ baba yetu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsinanz6riw ) . 
  it 's a christian prayer or something , sung in swahili . 
  wonderful . 
  happy to help !, 
  my favorite fantasy setting of all time was the different planes in planescape : torment . 
  it was just several layers of batshit crazy , high on mushrooms . 
  loved it . 
  i really , really like fantasy that goes as far beyond the standard tolkien mold as it can . 
  at the end of the day i still care more about story , though , so i can still appreciate works that uses traditional settings , but it takes quite some writing to win me over . 
  i also loved the irish/scottish/nordic mashup of the skellige isles in witcher 3 . 
  mixing cultures like that can be really cool , and it worked great in that game . 
  when it comes to sci fi i both like space exploration and cyberpunk . 
  exploring new and exciting places and cultures is always fun , and cyberpunk can come with some very interesting commentary when done right . 
  even if it tends to be a lot more fond of grand conspiracy theories than i am . 
  and while not a `` setting '' as such , i * love * a well-told time travel story . 
  the * 12 monkeys * tv show is just utter brilliance . 
  i 've never been to the us so i ca n't speak from any personal experience , but i remember an explanation of the differences by ( i think ) a swedish sociologist who tried to define the difference in freedom between the us and europe . 
  if i remember correctly , he defined it as the us being about `` freedom to do '' , while europe was about `` freedom to be '' . 
  so if you 're a real go-getter , maybe the us suits you better . 
  especially if you already have an education and do n't have to pay for that the first thing you do . 
  you can work hard , earn a lot of money , and spend that money on healthcare and your kid 's education , so that they can work hard and so on . 
  meanwhile , while europe might not be quite as business oriented , we have a different view of what encompasses `` freedom '' - freedom to live a life that is n't so dependent on your level of income , and perhaps the freedom to pursue passions sprung from knowing that there is a safety net there for us if things should n't work out . 
  the way i see it , there should be some middle ground between `` the old country sucks '' and `` the new country sucks '' , where you can appreciate both countries ' positives and wo n't be blasted by people from either country . 
  viking stuff is weird , since each country technically have their own viking history , and some of that lead to the creation of other ( future ) countries with * their * own history . 
  it can be hard to know what is `` my '' history in all of that , and i do n't think my teachers ever really delved into that . 
  i was probably taught `` general viking history '' , mostly about their western adventures . 
  their eastern exploits were n't focused on as much , which is a bit weird since those were `` our '' vikings . 
  that they were in the british isles is well-known , although perhaps not the true extent of it . 
  it 's possible that danes and norwegians know more about that , since they were the ones there . 
  that the vikings were in north america is probably mentioned because it 's cool that we were there before columbus , but it did n't really leave a mark so it 's not especially important in the grand scheme of things . 
  i would say that the most important lessons from our viking history , from our perspective , probably is how the nordic influence was spread to/established iceland and greenland . 
  it 's our common viking heritage that unites all of the nordic countries . 
  except for finland . 
  they tag along for different reasons . 
  :p i do n't know if swedes in general know that we 're germanic . 
  it 's not terribly important knowledge . 
  unless you 're a nerd about those kinds of things . 
  like me . 
  hm , interesting . 
  that sounds quite different from what i was taught , especially regarding the sami . 
  i wonder why that is ? 
  maybe a regional thing , if you 're not from stockholm ? 
  we do tend to focus on ourselves , or so i 've heard . 
   i do agree with what you said about ww2 , though . 
  what i meant by it being quickly acknowledged was that i always felt that the focus was on mainland europe . 
  but whenever we speak of our own involvement , yes , it 's always about those railroads . 
  despite there being more important stuff that we could talk about . 
  i also agree with you about the last paragraph . 
  i remember learning about the stone age , bronze age , iron age , the vikings , and then gustav vasa . 
  that leaves a pretty sizable chunk of our history out , for some weird reason . 
  i adore germany , and especially bavaria . 
  i have been to tegernsee a bunch of times since i have family there , and i love it , but i 'd probably want a slightly bigger city if i were to live there permanently . 
  so probably munich . 
  although i did spend a week in a suburb to berlin on a school trip back in the day , and that was pretty much everything i want from a place to live : a big city nearby , without actually living in the constant crowds . 
  i could definitely see myself living there as well . 
  i do love berlin . 
  london seems like a logical choice as well , since i would have to rely on english wherever i went anyway ( except for germany ) . 
  it 's just that brexit makes any such plans very unreliable at the moment . 
  i would n't want to be kicked out in two years just because they ca n't come up with a compromise . 
  i would want to leave our dreadful swedish winters behind , so a warm place would be nice . 
  italy is a fantastic country , and i loved spending a few weeks in tuscany a few years ago . 
  loving it as a holiday destination and thinking it 's a good place to relocate to are admittedly two very different things , but florence is the only south european city that 's really on my radar . 
  we had a forest fire a couple of years ago that was pretty bad . 
  about a thousand people had to be evacuated , with one person losing their life . 
  the fire encompassed 15,000 hectares/37 ,000 acres of forest , and we had to call in international help to get it under control . 
  it depends on what history you mean . 
  i was always interested in it , so i learned quite a lot . 
  but there are both stuff that you do n't learn because they are not prioritized from a swedish perspective , and stuff you do n't learn because they are deemed shameful and thus not taught . 
  the treatment of the sami * is one of those latter things . 
  hell , even sami history in general is n't taught . 
  it 's only these last few years that swedish tv seems to have realized that we have a kinda-indigenous minority up north whose lives and stories should be represented on screen . 
  i wish my school could have come to the same conclusion back in the day . 
  sweden during ww2 is also a curious blind spot that we have in our history classes . 
  we tend to focus on mainland europe , only quickly acknowledging how we let the nazis use our railways to ship men and materials around .

  at least on tv ( one channel may show shrek twice in one evening , once dubbed and once subbed ) . 
  my teachers ever only demanded consistency . 
  if you used `` trousers '' you could n't write `` color '' etc. 
  i like how we buy alcohol in a country with 40 % higher prices than the eu average to save money . 
  would n't be the first time . 
  taiwan and the south of china were `` conquered '' by han chinese migrations . 
  it 's right in a way . 
  all finnish students learn english at some point , but if these stats are for years 1-9 and english is n't taught 1-3 , then 30 % are not learning english right now . 
  same thing with the swedish stat for german and french : nearly everyone learns german , french or spanish but only for three years . 
  it really is damned warm up here . 
  not that i 'm complaining or anything , but some wind would be nice . 
  amusingly , sweden is warmer than western europe . 
  20c temperatures pretty much every day . 
  we do n't `` have '' ikea though . 
  it 's owned by a dutch trust nowadays . 
  they have been known to accidentally kill , and so were deemed unsafe . 
  you still kick our ass on skis every year . 
  and it kind of contradicts `` nice universities '' if my stockholmian friends are to be believed . 
  and dutch sounds like a drunk trying to talk german . 
  we went east , fucking with the russians while the danes fucked with the french . 
  i ca n't :( i 'll watch it tomorrow , luckily i 'll be busy all day and hopefully it wo n't be spoiled . 
  very few countries accept asylum seekers . 
  they ca n't really pick and choose . 
  most of them are refugees accepted for humanitarian reasons . 
  moving to sweden ( from outside schengen ) with no qualifications is pretty much impossible . 
  sure , there 's no real financial barrier but with the poorer schools in their area they wo n't be able to compete in academic achievment , and be ill prepared for higher education if they do get in . 
   christian ii i 'm not sure a dane who ruled sweden for less than a year can really be called swedish . 
   carl x gustavson hehe , it 's carl x gustaf ( assuming you were going for the 17th century ) . 
  it 's a double first name . 
  you sure do , though a lot of our immigrants are refugees who may never consider sweden their home but rather where they live until their home country stabilizes . 
  the us , by comparison , basically does n't take in refugees . 
  yeah , this would have been much better if the rioters were armed . 
  do n't forget that a lot of sds leaders are ... off-putting , and were before the election as well . 
   nhl players in the playoffs ca n't compete . 
  this applies to everyone , you know . 
  i do n't think any non-nhl player would get a spot in a full-strength swedish squad . 
  but do you prefer the olympics ? 
  because the us has n't won that in 30 years . 
  there 's also the swedish / r/swarje, 
  no epic sax guy or moonwalking bagpiper this year though . 
  nah , it was just longest since denmark won . 
  we 'll just keep it up north now . 
  [ one of my all-time favourite esc songs , ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i45kmnp55hq ) though the [ winner that year was n't bad either . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eync7zqiy9o ), 
  there 's a reason it holds the record for most points . 
  he was just fantastic . 
  only one country can win at a time , it was denmarks turn this year . 
  a guy on the show called the host a milf . 
  with two same-sex kisses , a mans naked ass and saying milf , i have a feeling there will be comments about this . 
  [ aww yusss . 
  just look at it as something we have in common , like a rivalry with our southern neighbours . 
  stole all of irelands gay votes , no doubt . 
  you were 5th like 4 years ago . 
  like every year . 
  [ i still prefer denmarks last winner . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avohqctnti0 ), 
  there are too many of them , they ca n't focus like vastly supriour nordic bloc can . 
  i 'm getting embarassingly pleased every time they try to speak swedish . 
  estonia , watch and learn : do n't mention you 're neighbours and the crowd wo n't boo . 
  and azerbaijan does n't evne have any neighbours . 
  i 'm gon na try and find a download tomorrow . 
  bulgaria gave us points ? 
  but ... they 're not in scandinavia ... 
  he came second in our selection process this year , apparantly this was the consolation price . 
  stop saying hashtag you ass . 
  edit : what is wrong with you ? 
  meanwhile , there would n't be a swede alive . 
  and azerbaijan two years ago . 
  i swear half of these point awarders are drunk out of their minds . 
  we gave 12 points to norway ? 
  shocking !, 
  we got points from all but one country last year . 
  the uk does give us a lot of points though . 
  wiki says you only give more points to ireland . 
  our media also complains about the eastern and balkan voting `` blocs '' . 
  there is no nordic voting bloc though , all of us just always send the best songs . 
  oh yes . 
  sweden would gladly foot the cost if necessary . 
  eurovision ** must happen . 
  yes . 
  she uses fans a lot in her acts , but i kinda doubt anyone outside of sweden knew that . 
  and a mans naked ass . 
  bent over . 
  okay , now they 're just messing with turkey on purpose . 
  what is going on ? 
  a terrible sketch , you 're not missing anything of value . 
  there was a mans naked ass though . 
  should be popular ... 
  oh god no , i thought this sketch was cancelled . 
  oh , of course * france * is the example on how to vote !, 
   `` ireland will be competing for the same votes as us : a lone guy with an upturned fringe and an up-tempo song . '', 
  ah yes , that demographic . 
  and france could send daft punk , and the uk someone under 60 !, 
  hey !, 
  we sent a feminine , blond guy !, 
  norway waht r u doin norway stahp, 
  it might just be a revolutionary retirement scheme . 
  two 60 + performers in a row ca n't be a coincidence . 
  you 're one to talk . 
  world championship finals 2011 ?

  i mean , it is bad from a currency/market trust/eurozone point of view if one does n't have rules and laws one can trust ( what if no one cares - what happens to the currency then , who will pay etc ) but that ship sailed long ago . 
  they are probably doing the right thing from a belgian point of view . 
  it is nice of you to answer , but nothing really dispute what i said - the muslims * are * more negative towards homosexuality , equality for women , sex outside of marriage , abortions etc than the average brit - and it is increasing . 
  so , people are actually right in fearing it , and thinking muslims are all that - because to a much larger degree they are . 
  they are far more likely to be negative against gay , women etc. 
  and again - what are the muslims community doing ? 
  nothing , it seems . 
  so , if you are going to defend them - why are n't they acting , and how can you defend them when the conservatives are increasing ? 
  is n't it right then to constantly critiscise them - i think we let everyone down if we ignore those attitudes . 
  so , they should be criscised - daily , if it up to me , just as other conservative idiots . 
  however , they are often getting a free pass , because they are immigrants . 
  i do not think they should get a free pass , not at all . 
   at least in britain most muslims are fine with homosexuals , abortion and treat women like everybody else does-a human being . 
  sorry , no , unless you claim this is the way other brits feel about homosexuals , sharia etc as well . 
  [ muslims in britain hold more conservative views on abortion , homosexuality etc ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/may/07/muslims-britain-france-germany-homosexuality ) [ 2007 survey that shows 61 % of muslims want to make homosexuality illegal - lgbt ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_in_islam ) [ muslims in britain on sharia ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1510866/poll-reveals-40pc-of-muslims-want-sharia-law-in-uk.html ) do n't you find those attitudes appalling ? 
  honestly , you seem to be seeing the world from rose tinted glasses - i knew this and i am not british :-) . 
  perhaps the ones you meet are nice , i do not oppose that , but they are sadly , not representative . 
  if you are to defend the muslims in europe , honorably as it is , one should always start with facts and work from there . 
  i find these attitudes much more abhorringand frightning , than the abstract fear of terror . 
  nor do i see them diminishing , they are in fact - increasing . 
  i think it is normal that one fears that - and is disgusted by that . 
  my question is - why is n't the muslims dealing with this ? 
   but out church leaders are very much against homosexuality , or at least gay marriage , as are out muslims . 
  your church leaders are not against homosexuality as i have understood it , but against gay marriage . 
  important diffence . 
  yes , discrimination still , but nothing against what one faces in islam . 
  with the 4 out of 10 who wants sharia - what do you think will happens to gay people there ? 
  do you honestly mean that 4 our of 10 non muslim brits want to kill off all the gays ? 
  i do not belive that , and i will not even get the statistics , i am sure you agree with me :-) . 
   whilst i do agree islam does have some backwards views when it comes to women , it is n't any different in a secular state to that of christianity ( in the uk at least ) . 
  yes , it is . 
  your church leaders , a ) have less influence , b ) the brits themselves do n't seem to give a shit what they church leaders say . 
  as i have proven , the muslims , in a secular state or not , have * much more * conservative/idiotic views on women , so it does matter - a lot . 
  also , how many forced marriages and honour killings are there among native brits in comparison to muslims - for example . 
  not all muslims are horrible of course , and i applaud your effort to defend them . 
  however , you should perhaps start out with the facts , and work from there - denying the truth , like with homosexuality or sharia does n't do anyone any good . 
   if there was christian dictatorship i ca n't imagine it would be all sun and rainbows but there we go . 
  yes , but we have quit those centuries ago , because they were barbaric and moronic and it is vital to separate religion/state . 
  that is seldom the case in the muslim world , and it is not even a trend . 
  in fact , take egypt where the muslim brotherhood won - if they care so much about separation of state/religion and to keep religion out , why them ? 
  the trend is unfortunately to mix them up , not throw them out . 
  it is the opposite of what europe is trying to do actually . 
  so , the majority of the people in muslim countries says * no * to a secular state ( and freedom for women ) . 
  that should give you some pause - should n't it ? 
   i 'm having fun debating this btw . 
  :d me to . 
   i do agree but i 'm just sick of how all muslims are apparently to blame for this . 
  when a christian leader condemns gay people or says women should n't be allowed abortion not all christians are also tarred with the same brush , whereas it seems that 's not the case when it comes to muslims . 
  i do not know what it is like in the uk , but honestly , i am having a hard time coming up with a swedish protestant priest , claiming any of those things - we have lesbian bishops for god 's sake . 
  and we have never had female circumscicion and honour killings or hijab/head scarf . 
  so , the ones mostly speaking/doing these things are immigrants , to a vast majority muslims , ( although for example honour killings can be done by other people to i have understood ) . 
  so , i find it rather natural that we * do * concentrate on the ones commiting those things in sweden - and they are almost always immigrants , very often muslims . 
  i guess one could say that not all of the immigrants do this , but among those who do , there are almost always immigrants . 
  it is a dilemma , i know ( one that was highlighted in sweden recently when the muslims were blamed for the riots , and i am not even sure the majority were muslims , they were immigrants , not the same thing ) and frustrating , but i also think the muslim community could do a lot more to fix this . 
  why not clearly support homosexuals ? 
  where are those imams ? 
  where are the lesbians imams who refuse to circumscise ? 
  i can go on and on about the lack of female precence for one thing , and that is just one thing i can criscise . 
  yes , i know it is the same in the catholic church , but i have yet to meet a single catholic who cares - female catholic politicians tell them to go away - not exactly the case in saudi/iran or among the muslims here etc is it ? 
  so , the blame is also on both sides . 
  also , as i said before , i have more problem with for example negative attitudse towards homosexuals , jews and women , which * a lot * share , than fear of terror . 
  get rid of those attitudes , and i think that will go a long way towards understanding . 
  i also have a problem with this - some people are so afraid of being racist for example , that the do not speak out . 
  we do not forbid male circumscion for example , although it is harmful to the child . 
  i am ashamed that my country does not label it as the child abuse that it is . 
   it 's not exactly terrifying when the only successful european terrorist attacks this year committed by muslims have involved a single death . 
  bulgaria ? 
  the killing of israeli tourists ? 
   true , but you also have basque separatists in spain , i thought they had quit and commited no attacks in 2012 . 
   it 's not exactly terrifying when the only successful european terrorist attacks this year committed by muslims have involved a single death . 
  as someone else pointed out , it is not the fear of terror attacks , but a lot of other stuff , including the rethoric , anti - feminism , honour killings ( i know not all of them are commited by muslims , but they are certainly over represented ) female circumscion ( same there ) etc. 
  far more than being the fear of dying in a subway , it has to do with having the feeling that our basic values and our way of life under attack . 
  edit : remembered that the terror attack in bulgaria was 2013 . 
  yes exactly , they might do some property damage , but they are actually never out to harm a person or change the course of a nation a la breivik or muslim extremists . 
  it feels like those `` terrorist '' skews the numbers a bit , i am not exactly frightened by them , not one bit , unless i am a trash bin owner . 
  [ here ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_memo-13-463_en.htm ) is the press release . 
  belgium is pointed out as not having taken effective action , so the commission says it will step up the edp for belgium . 
  not that it seems to matter actually , it is not like the commission will ever do anything . 
  perhaps they will write a strongly worded letter next time ... . . ( not that i am saying that belgium should be more punished/not punished than anyone else , but i clearly remember them saying that there would be fines etc , if one did n't comply with the budget rules . 
  it is interesting to see their lack of action ) . 
  what would the french public want the ecb to do ? 
  sweden - i 've heard it although i do n't know if it is currently an active campaign . 
  i checked , and right now they are saying that one should eat 500 g/day of vegetables/fruit . 
  i eat so much vegetables and fruit anyway so i never think about it actually . 
  i think people who eat unhealthy spend more time thinking about it , than people who have a reasonably healthy lifestyle . 
  just counted , to answer your question , and i have already had a fruit as a snack , and a salad for lunch . 
  since i am having carrot soup for dinner , i am set for the day ... ... 
   liberalising the labour laws down here does n't mean we magically become like sweden . 
  no , but your option is clinging on to an outdated version that was * never * competitive , but you could hide that fact in the free for all version that was the former ez . 
  that is not really an option is it - you have needed to reform since the 90 's at least , well since before the euro and not doing it is n't really doing you any favours . 
  but , if you want to cling to bureacracy and refuse reforms that should have been done ages ago - feel free . 
  but , then again , why should anyone , in particular countries who did these reforms when they were called for , feel sorry for spain ? 
  i mean , one is not asking spain to kick everyone to the curb , just do stuff that should had been done decades ago ( that people are being kicked out , blame that on banks , not on anything else ) . 
  how do you mean that you can become competitive while clinging to an outdated , bureacratic version of what never worked in the first place ? 
  how is suggesting you 'd be more like denmark beneficial only to the employer ? 
  not just them , it is honestly horrendous in some places . 
  if you are a women , you are up for grabs basically , literally , in the street . 
  you are not a person , you are a property , and if no man defends you , you are there to be taken . 
  for example the masaai 's refusal to speak to women , at all . 
  women were not supposed to talk to men - if a man wanted anything , he spoke to them , not the other way around ( women had no needs ) .

we can agree to disagree on that, 
  yes ... and your point is ? 
  when did i argue against that russia is trying to take ukraine ? 
  he is using the separatists for his own means , but there is simply no evidence that he `` created '' them , you do n't `` create '' a separatist movement . 
  just like there is russian propaganda , there is also western propaganda from the more radical newspapers ... 
  i urge you to try to analyse all sides of a conflict before stating such simplistic claims . 
  putin might be using the separatists to get a big chunk out of ukraine , but he did n't `` create '' the separatists , they have always been there . 
  many of the leaders of the separatists are from ukraine , and the main force is from ukraine ( even though they receive help from russia ) this makes their demands more legitimate , and for this reason more negotiations must ensue . 
  the ceasefire is a good first step , but not enough . 
  they need to seriously start considering federalization . 
  and also , ukraine has a responsiblity not to bomb the people they are trying to `` protect '', 
  and i bet everyone are blaming putin . . yes , he has been using the situation to his advantage , but both sides have a responsibility, 
  swedish only in the eye of the law, 
  true , i 'm fully aware that we are not neutral . 
  but i wish we would be , and joining nato would essentially make that impossible for many , many years to come . 
  well , firstly we can ask the question , why join nato ? 
  russia ( or any other country ) is very unlikely to invade sweden , and if they do they would have to take finland first . 
  if by any chance an eu country , which is not member of nato , would be attacked by an outside force , i 'm willing to bet my bank account that the other eu countries ( and thus nato ) would join to defend that country . 
  now , if we can establish that there is no urgent need to join nato we can bring up the reasons why a membership would be bad . 
  as a neutral country we can choose not to join military campaigns we do not agree with , we can more easily choose how much we should spend on our military , and most importantly , we can take on more of a mediator role in wold conflicts . 
  in the end , joining nato would be both an expensive and uneccessary endevour , something that swedes have said many times , that they want no part of . 
  seriously what is this , fuck you government , majority of people in sweden has already said again and again that we do not want nato , in fact according to a poll in 2014 , only 31 % is in favour . 
  do n't do this , listen to the people . 
  ya think ? 
  pretty dark , but i chuckled, 
  no , nothing wrong with it , but one should keep to the truth . 
  these caricatures are trying to make it seem that putin is personally responsible for deliberately shooting down the plane . 
  while we in fact do n't know if that is the case . 
  even the us has admitted that the plane was probably not shot down on purpose , and we also do n't know if it is the separatists or the russians who shot it . 
  just because the separatists are supplied by the russians does n't mean that putin is responsible for their every action . 
  do n't you read ? 
  i said the exact opposite of that . 
  sure thing , in the conflict i 'm mainly pro-palestinian ( not that i do n't think that that side does wrong things too ) , but i think that the occupation and building of settlements must stop , and israel must give back the land that they have unjustly conquered . 
  hanging up an israeli flag in malm\u00f6 was extremely stupid , and in my opinion very provocative , seeing as alot of palestinians live here , and many of them despise israel with all their heart . 
  but that does not justify beating someone up with iron pipes , i said that he did not deserve it , but that he had it coming . 
  it 's like with the israeli kids , obviously it is horrible that they got kidnapped and killed , and that is not justifiable in any way . 
  but they did live on occupied soil , stolen from someone else , so the family had it coming ( too bad that the kids have to suffer for their parents crime ), 
  i wonder if people downvote me because they love israel or because they do n't think malm\u00f6 is pro-palestinian :p, 
  im not saying he deserved what happened to him , but he had it coming , malm\u00f6 is really pro-palestinian, 
  then why not keep it as it is now ? 
  smaller politicial entities are usually much better at providing for their people than larger ones , we do n't need a federation , not yet . 
  such empty threats , you 're the one trying to take over another country , and you would never be able to defeat nato if it would come to it, 
  oh dear , i really hope that putin will be removed from power before it goes to far ... or well , i guess it already has . . 
  wait what ? 
  how legit is that source about the tass thing ? 
  it feels odd that you would call yourself `` of the soviet union '' when the the ussr does n't exist . 
  do you , as a russian , think that means that we are witnessing a return of the soviet union , even if only by name ? 
  stalinism is essentially a more dogmatic , paranoid form of the other . 
  fair point, 
  how did scattered_disk get upvoted , but you downvoted ? 
  i said relatively, 
  yeah , and even you guys had to fight a civil war back in the day due to differences between the north and south , and those differences are/were still relatively minor if you compare with europe . 
  but i just moved here !, 
  dude , they may not have been good . 
  but they were way better than stalin . 
  it is worth noting that the purges ended with the death of stalin . 
  yes , political opposition was oppressed , but there was no mass genocide after his death . 
  sure , i wo n't argue with that , my point was simply that if today 's nations can learn one thing from the old dictatorships , it would be the principle of motivating your people to do great things . 
  in sweden ( and i 'm assuming most other countries ) the only appreciation people get for their work is the salary , and sometimes even that is too little . 
  some motivation here and there , in the form of speeches or posters , could go a long way i think . 
  of course , the reasons for it would not be to turn you into a resource of the state . 
  it would be so you can improve yourself , as well as improve the community . 
  tbh , i do n't see anything wrong with that . 
  i would appreciate very much if my government tried to motivate me to study , work and constantly improve myself . 
  in fact , i think a lot of countries could benefit from a little more of that . 
  contrary to popular theory , russia is not a super-religious country . 
  both germany and britain have more people who identify as believers . 
  except for the eu of course , and defence agreements with the various nordic countries . 
  except that we do . 
  nato is not the only military alliance in the world . 
  society looked different back then , firstly we did n't have such a high immigration rate, 
  we are a member of the european union and allied with the other nordic countries, 
  you 're right , but we ca n't live our life in fear that war might break out with russia . 
  for now we have to ask ourselves how likely is it that russia will attack sweden within the next five years . 
  as long as we are a member of the european union i think that is very unlikely . 
  the reason we are increasing the budget is not so we will be able to repel a full scale invasion conducted by russian invasion . 
  it does n't matter how much we increase it , we ca n't win such a war by ourselves . 
  the reason we are increasing the budget is 1 ) so that we can improve our presence in the baltic sea , and intercept unauthorized submarines in our waters and military jets in our airspace , and 2 ) survive long enough for our allies to come help us if the worst thing would happen . 
  agreed, 
  no , it is not a disgrace . 
  this `` weak '' military is one of the things that give us a very high standard of living . 
  if we want to increase our military budget we have to take money from other areas , such as education and healthcare . 
  this is why we ca n't increase our military budget too quickly , and this is what the politicians are realizing . 
  i realize that we need to improve our defenses , but not at the expense of some of the other very important civil sectors . 
  i think this increase sounds reasonable . 
  nah , more like two ends of the same horseshoe , which contains all other ideologies, 
  countries fighting against eachother over land was common . 
  everyone had imperialistic ambitions in those days , sweden were just as bad as russia . 
  same thing between britain and france . 
  that 's your feeling . 
  my feeling is that money should not be the thing that drives politicians , and it is not what drives me in my profession . 
  yes , you should be rewarded if you do a good job , but there is a limit . 
  mr. l\u00f6fven might be doing a good job , but you can find thousands who can do an equally good job for half that salary . 
  the problem with having money as the driving force is that you will get the wrong kind of people looking for the job . 
  also , i agree on that public sector employees are underpaid , but now we are talking about the hotshots in the top , with an average wage far far above the average wage in the country . 
  no you 're right . 
  you 're fucking not worth that 200 000 euros/yr . 
  whatever you do you should do to help the country , if i did all of that i would never demand that salary , because i would not need it . 
  in most cases , professionals do not use their own money for travel within the job . 
  it is the country or corporation who pays that .

a quick summary of the common misconceptions in the assange case , and why they are misconceptions . 
  and s\u00e4llskapsresan . 
  its linked to / r/european at the same time , so they probably come over to `` help '' ... 
  i live in sweden , so you are not fooling me . 
  no matter how many threads you go on about it in . 
  then how is it that we have non-racists talk about it and not be called racist ? 
  why is it that every time some sweden democrat says something racist about africans , jews or muslims , its always `` oh , so i \u00b4 m a racist just for talking about immigration '' ? 
  edit hello sd !, 
  this is a lie that is spammed in almost every thread about sweden . 
  when will / r/europe understand that this is just part of an agenda ? 
  and this time its not . 
  redditors love it , but its false . 
  they * are * right wing extremists and racists . 
  they started using these tricks on people outside of sweden to get sympathies . 
  norwegians and danes fell for it . 
  you do n't seem to know who i am talking about , so why would you call it `` like it 's nothing '' ? 
   fellow countryman of yours : i know what some are claiming . 
  it does n't mean its true . 
   that sounds like stasi stuff to me * if * one believe it . . and as has been pointed out many times before , that `` study '' has been heavily criticized since its not about political journalists . 
  when looking at how things are reported , there is no bias . 
   just people who want to speak their mind without getting battered under godwins and guilt tripped into conformity today all forms of racism is excused by redditors crying `` godwin '' . 
   as in sweden . 
  a climate where the left held the racism gun to everybodies head if they do not agree with their norms for what is acceptable towards immigrants and more social issues . 
  this is becoming like a test . 
  are you gullible enough to fall for this bullshit , and not realize its made up by extremists ? 
  the right wing extremists and racists are really happy that you dont fact check them , and just blindly believe them . 
  for those that really want to know , saying that you `` cant talk about immigration '' in sweden is a trick used by populists , to basically force every discussion to be about immigration . 
  they used norwegian and danish media to spread it further . 
   or does sweden just get all the bad publicity ? 
  look throug this thread , check r/european , swedenyes , theredpill and such . 
  they have an agenda , and just make shit up . 
  its a right wing extreme propaganda forum . 
  of course its the `` leftists '' that are to blame ... 
  i would say that r/sweden is one of the most racist forums on reddit , outside of whiterights . 
  thats a pathetic rhetoric . 
  if sweden is not as right wing populist or as afraid of immigrants as the rest , then swedes need to be smeared . 
  that `` study '' has been heavily criticized , since its not about political journalists . 
  hen is a word to be used when you do n't know the gender of someone in third person , so instead of saying `` he or she '' you can say `` hen '' . 
  there is nothing of `` the old ones are not good enough '' , there was no old one . 
  its not political correctness , its development of language . 
  there was a finnish documentary that brough up the differences the nordics view each other . 
  and specifically the importance for norwegians , danes and finns have in finding reasons to look down on swedes . 
  finding whatever is viewed as demeaning and saying that i typical of swedes . 
  its difficult not to see that with this obsession some has about an imagined `` extreme political correctness '' . 
  and then of course there are the political reasons , like danish media and politicians . 
  they have the pronoun in finland , but no one goes on about `` political correctness '' then . 
  its more about wanting to point fingers at sweden . 
  if the other countries goes on about a word that harmless , then they are trying to hard . 
  thats what i mean . 
  and its not just this thread , its pretty much everyone that involves sweden . 
  its an area with above average amount of left wingers . 
  right wingers often complains about it , and uses it in a demeaning way , `` well its probably someone from s\u00f6dermalm '' . 
  right wingers love the stereotype of all `` far-left '' journalists living in one place , dressing the same , and saying the same things etc. 
  its like believing all right wingers live in castles and have butlers named jeeves . 
  this is the circlejerk . 
  when someone uses `` h\u00e4n '' , do some poeple in finland get upset and go on about `` political correctness '' ? 
   as long as i 'm allowed to say danskjavlar every now and again , we 're good :d what more could one ask for , 
  pretty much . 
  danes often say swedes are politically correct , but that has more to do with wanting to view themselves as laid back , or that we do n't share their view on immigration . 
  and populists always go on about political correctness and `` not allowed to have a debate '' or `` not allowed to be in media '' when most disagree with them . 
  so `` pc '' , and incorrectness , mean different things here then to englis speakers . 
  the phrases has been misused for to long . 
  in fact , those over here that calls themselves politically incorrect tends to be the ones that overreact the most . 
  conspiracy theorists , doomsday prophets , right wing extremists worried about `` swedish culture '' being removed , sharia laws around the corner etc etc. 
  the whole `` politically correct '' thing has more to do with not liking populism or racism , then you get called politically correct by some . 
  threads about sweden often attract racists and propagandists , and not just from r/sweden , but r/european and r/whiterights . 
  but the mods really do a good job .

  the swedish government has responded : '' we have not apologized '' . 
  which was just a blogger doing a `` whats the deal with some men taking up two seats on the bus '' and a lot of of kids online got angry * at her * for . 
  she was not the one overreacting . 
  but this myth will continue to spread as `` swedish femininazi going crazy '' or calling them `` sjw '' which just further proves that its the anti-feminists that are just overly sensitive . 
  then just call ecuador .

  the evil `` white knights '' are destroying us trough ... eh ... refugees , i guess ? 
  oh , the misery !,

  more that the guy was not swedish . 
  i could have said `` he is not swedish , so why are you embarrassed as a swede . '', 
   white knight sweden tried to be a hero but now is drowning in its misery and it 'll only get worse .

  http://sv.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/2wf49l/antisemitic_views_in_europe_834x642/ anti-semetic beliefs . 
  and swedes .

   there are hundreds of millions of potential refugees today why not inflate it to 5 billion ( who are not international middle class ) while you 're at it ? 
  or be serious and use the unhcr figures , which is 60 million ( at the end on of 2014 ) . 
   there are hundreds of millions of potential refugees today , and we ca n't grant all of them the right to rebuild their lives . 
  `` it 's better to help none , if you ca n't help all '' this is the get-out-of-jail-free card for any humanitarian mission . 
   that is sad , but again , not something they have a right to . 
  being human , they will desperately try . 
  i do agree that europe can not take all , though , it 's not an easily solved problem . 
  and rightwing politicians are about spreading fear . 
  another feel . 
  `` migrants '' are the totally wrong word to use for refugees in jordan . 
  if you do n't call the people fleeing from syria refugees , you can abandon the word all together . 
  also , refugees in jordan have little to no chance at rebuilding their lives . 
  the best thing about revolutions is that they put fear in the elite . 
  usually the neighbouring nations that avoid revolutions fare better . 
  because it 's not a credible threat . 
  morrissey sang about killing the queen . 
  not a credible threat either , obviously . 
  she has enough money to hire a contract killer . 
  except that she has n't . 
  she 's a fucking clown , that 's all , and that 's what the court said . 
  `` not a credible threat '' . 
  yeah , apparently you can vote from abroad for 15 years . 
  this is a discussion about those who 've been abroad for more than 15 years . 
  yeah , this whole `` ca n't vote from abroad '' struck me as absurd . 
  we just had three turks talking about the election on swedish radio . 
  they all voted from sweden . 
  if you 're a swede , you can vote from abroad . 
  i do n't understand why uk has this law . 
  open nationalism has never been something swedes have rallied around . 
  we 're totally different from norwegians in that way . 
  people used to hoist the flag when there 's a family birthday , end of the school year and royalists would do it on the king 's birthday . 
  but collective flag waving is reserved for celebrating victories in sports . 
  right-wing humor = = punching down, 
   voted by abstentions that 's an euphemism for `` did not care enough to vote '' . 
  i 'm sure half of the populists in brussels concentrate more on drinking beer on tax payers dime , than parliamentary work . 
  ah , you 're right , thanks . 
  this particular person seems to have done a long journey to end up with the views he has now . 
  i wondered if it could have been different . 
  yeah , i know you 're a tribal people . 
  the twist is that he was born and raised in denmark . 
  the guy was born in denmark , that 's kind of the issue . 
  yeah , and for some reason , denmark has very radical muslim groups . 
  7 billion people do not have permanent residence in denmark . 
  the guy was born in denmark . 
  his parents did not have danish citizenship when he was born , though . 
  only one of them would get danish citizenship , though . 
  i wonder if a neonazi of , say , swedish or germany origin would be granted citizenship . 
  there are some bad areas in there , yes . 
  the last few months malm\u00f6 has also struggled with the huge inflow of migrants . 
  but otherwise it 's far from a bad city . 
  `` bleeding heart liberal '' is more of an idiom . 
  here it 's sometimes shortened to `` bleeding hearts '' , but there is no universally accepted political leaning to add to it . 
  `` socialist '' , maybe . 
  you 're obviously the expert !, 
  i 've lived in malm\u00f6 , had a great time . 
  it was a few years back , though . 
   both groups will be ineligible for family reunification if they live in an ** official ghetto area ** and employment requirements will also be sharpened for both categories . 
  wtf is an `` official ghetto area '' ? 
  poland is a much larger economy , however . 
  yeah , if you 're against institutionalized discrimination , you 're a bleeding heart liberal , did n't you get the memo ? 
  are you sure four wo n't be too many ? 
  that 's the way of most of effective propaganda . 
  i think the point was * exactly * that : germany exports weapons and get refugees in return as a direct result . 
  which is pretty much a lie . 
  so i take it you do n't like gays ? 
  yes , how come most americans can have rational debate about the millions of illegal immigrants within the us , but most of those who comment in this forum think that a few million people , looking for a better life , will destroy europe ? 
   but since they apparently want to help everyone in the world regardless of them being refugees or not this where you are wrong , swedish asylum rules are not that different . 
  the biggest difference is that we offered permanent residence to all syrians . 
  people from other areas are judged on an individual basis . 
  one large problem is that deportations of those who are not granted asylum does n't work as well as it should . 
  more people should get a quick denial at the border , though . 
  54k is a silly low number for the eu as a whole . 
  the current levels of immigration are not sustainable , but if stronger measures are taken to rebuff the 50-60 % that do n't have a case , more will be discouraged to come . 
  `` life-vest or ammo-jacket '' , basically ? 
  i assume that goes for jw and members of political parties too ? 
  what does it say ? 
  haha , one hattan for man , another h\u00e4ttan for troll . 
  top innovation country in europe was a recent submission about sweden . 
  `` remove their democratic rights '' yeah there was even a neo-nazi demonstration recently in j\u00f6nk\u00f6ping . 
  these guys have more freedom of expression in sweden than in germany . 
  yes , there 's a pushback against anti-immigration views in mainstream media , but no removal of democratic rights - alternative media is free to publish all kinds of views . 
  it is n't ? 
  united we stand , divided we fall . 
  it 's the same in sweden , basically . 
  primary school can be chosen , but where you live matters a lot . 
  so usually you have between 1-4 schools to choose from . 
  if none satisfied the educated middle-class parents , they can choose to move . 
  that 's not really how it works . 
  you ca n't easily move your children , what you do is that you move the entire family to a better area , if you can . 
  i meant some sort of quota system , and limited by number . 
  i 'm also a supported of making it harder to come to europe and apply without papers , but easier to apply for asylum from official centers abroad . 
  this is neither easy or popular , however . 
  bad luck , then . 
  but we 're not going to let anyone starve or freeze . 
  because we would not put them in tents without heating ? 
  yes , if conscripts were to freeze to death , you can bet people would complain . 
  [ because they already have ] ( https://news.vice.com/article/in-pictures-syrian-refugees-are-freezing-to-death-as-snow-blankets-the-region ) . 
  we should absolutely institute emergency border controls . 
  absolutely , but denying the right to seek asylum is not one of the variables in play at the moment . 
  yeah , probably , but by then refugees to europe was not on anyone 's agenda .

  i have access to academic journals of course , i am very interested in how you are going to prove that the triangle of death do not exist . 
   if the europeans really want to keep syriza out of power , the best answer would be quickly to forgive a big chunk of debt . 
  i do n't think the eu has no business whatsoever to interfere with the national elections , one way or another . 
  i mean , imagine what could happen.the eu work with madrid to make abolutely sure that the catalans not get independence ? 
  the eu threatens the finns to make sure that the true finns get no places in the parlament or tell the french that they will not get x and y if the choose lepen ? 
  apart from the fact that i think that in every instance of those cases it would piss people off and make them vote for whatever party the eu does n't like , it is just wrong . 
  no , no , no , the eu should accept whatever we vote for , it is their demcratic duty - do n't manipulate it . 
  so , if the greeks want syrizia - so be it . 
  it 's the choice of the greeks , no one elses . 
   and getting the european parliament involved in setting macroeconomic conditions is a recipe for paralysis . 
  dear god , yes . 
  it sounds like a recipe for disaster to me . 
  do not involve the ep in the emf . 
   what 's your reasoning for saying they should be a net contributor ? 
  well , if 25 % of their gdp is undeclared , and from there we calculate who should receive and who should get from the eu , maybe they should receive less from the structural funds for example . 
  as in - if we all give 1 % but spain receives 1,2 and sweden 0,8 - then we give and they do n't . 
  if they cheat so much , maybe they should receive 0,8 % - like us . 
  and maybe bulgaria could use that funds ? 
   zsorry , but the gut feeling of a non-specialist is not exactly rock solid evidence . 
  i am more of a specialist than you are and i have posted links that oppose to what you say . 
  it just fits in your narrative , there is no reason not to believe me , unless you want to . 
  i can post more reports too - i 've since looked around , and * no one * apart from yours metion that numbers . 
  so , how many reports do you need ? 
  five ? 
  six ? 
   because those come out entirely of our pocket , considering that we pay 6 billion euros more into the eu budget than we receive . 
  no , a ) just because you are a net payer does n't give you right to misuse funds . 
  for example , those funds could have gone to environmental issues in the atlantic instead . 
  and it is not your money - it is eu money . 
  are you saying that since you pay six billion more you have the right to misuse 6 billion euros , until your break even ? 
  that is idiotic reasoning . 
  and , the fact that you pay 6 billion more and misuse them - well , perhaps you should pay 7 then , if cheating is widespread in italy . 
  and it is also a moral question . 
  eu does n't work if everyone cheats or if countries does n't follow the rules . 
  why should n't italy follow the rules ? 
  no , i can not find stories like that in every country . 
  did you read all the links above ? 
  [ a mafia legacy taints the earth in southern italy ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/world/europe/beneath-southern-italy-a-deadly-mob-legacy.html ) [ triangle of death ] ( triangle of death ) [ triangle of death . 
  surges of cancer in southern italy linked to triangle of death ) . 
  we do not have unexplained cancer , the camorra and posinous earth like you read about here . 
  are you saying most countries have that ? 
  where is that in the uk then ? 
  i am very interested . 
  and , it is one thing having for example cow milk instead of buffalo milk , but it is not the same if the olives who gets replaced for example comes from naples and contain toxins . 
  or the vegetables . 
  and , you do know that the buffaloes in buffalo mozzarella are from that area . 
  would you give your child that cheese now ? 
  you are right , i have never ever heard the number 20 % . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.svensktnaringsliv.se/multimedia/archive/00016/ska_det_vara_vitt_el_16777a.pdf ) is a report that says it is around 5-5 - 15 % . 
  honestly , maybe restaurants have 20 % , but not that many more areas . 
   . and the football world cup too . 
  did n't you win it last time :-) . 
  well , you are lightyears ahead of us in that arean . 
  good luck, 
   ecause the eu budget does n't work that way . 
  it 's not as if the spaniards not paying their taxes means their government contributes less to the eu , so you have to pay more to make it up . 
  ahem - yes it does . 
  they have a lower gdp and perhaps they are net receiver when they should contribute ? 
  perhaps we wrongly have been given spain money for all those years . 
   why should i trust this report over the other ? 
  because i have never ever even remotely heard your number , and i live in sweden and hate the black market . 
  even organisations that use it for their arguments ( like the one i posted , ordered by svenskt n\u00e4ringsliv ) do not use that number . 
   considering italy is the third largest net contributor to the eu budget , and is a net contributor by a huge margin , i would say that this is a national concern . 
  no , it is an eu concern . 
  because if they worked they would receive less of the structural funds , and perhaps even less of the cap : we are now 28 countries and - it is not national . 
  how can eu funds being misused be a national concern . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2013/11/04/eu-funds-for-l-aquila-earthquake-misused-italy-and-brussels-blamed/ ) . 
  and that is just one of many examples , it is not hard to find misused funds actually . 
   owever , i blame the goverments of the tax paying countries ( and the citizens of those people who vote for those governments ) for this rather than the eu . 
  these governments are choosing to be part of a system that grants massive subsidies in a corrupt fashion and the electorate are consenting to this by voting for those governments . 
  oh , those too - but why not blame the corrupt governments and the people that chooses them too ? 
  how on earth can they be innocent ? 
   perhaps you think that the system can be reformed and improved ? 
  ( personally i think the only solution is to stop being part of the system . 
  no , we are too small . 
  the only thing we can do is leave which i 'll be voting for . 
   poisonous * besides , you are n't too educated about italian food ( or mafia ) either . 
  we in eu have quite a lot of regulations and quality standards for our food . 
  italy is fully on top of this stuff , and you 'll find doc/dop/docg / igp labelings on a lot of our stuff . 
  these labels are only allowed to companies who certify the quality of the food they produce , and they are controlled by national and european observers . 
  ok , so why does that with olive oil happen ? 
  and why [ this ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/9406507/italys-mozzarella-king-arrested-over-contaminated-cheese.html ) . 
  if it works - those things are then not happening ? 
   on top of this , in italy the food centrality has led to the rise of a proper cultural movement that advocates the need of clean , high-quality homegrown food . 
  this movement started out as a protest against fast-food chains and now it has grown to the point of being the philosophical staple of multinational food distributors such as eataly . 
  i know - and brilliant . 
  however , it can be as homegrown as ever , it does n't matter if the soil contains toxins . 
   naples outskirts are in another world entirely . 
  those are cursed , god-forsaken lands where mafia rules and even the police has very little power . 
  nothing much comes out of those lands - you will never find in your stores food from there , even i do n't . 
  that sort of crop is destined to go into naples discount grocery stores , and likely not much further . 
  you should n't worry about mafia food coming into your stores anytime soon . 
  buffalo mozzarella cheese is from that area . 
  wine , olives etc. 
  can you guarantee that none of them are toxic cancerous and whatever - i honestly do n't think you can . 
  and can you guarantee that they do n't secretely transfer it to a nicer area of italy to mix with the `` good '' cheese etc ? 
  from what i understand that is already happening . 
   4.6 % less . 
  no , i have a far more updated report actually , 10 - 20 %  as long as you act the way you act in your posts , you 'll only ever be seen as a well-off , privileged , entitled and most importantly naive brat who knows nothing about the economy . 
   in general , people tend to prefer getting bread on the table for their family .

  agreed . 
   the american government is voted on in a democratic fashion . 
  um , i think you 're one of the few who thinks that their political system is democratic . 
   free and independent information in all kinds of languages is only a mouse-click away . 
  yeah , so is misinformation and propaganda . 
  especially in the places we 're talking about . 
  yeah , and just like with the us , it 's unfair to punish the people for bad government . 
  do you really think that it would be good for anyone if russia reverted back to communism ? 
  there are plenty who would `` give a fuck '' about that ... 
  ** yeah !!!, 
  ** let 's punish the russian people for their government !, 
  they should all suffer , who cares . 
  and , what message is he trying to send ? 
  had some excellent * fika * !, 
   kinda taints that nice rosy picture a bit ... 
  it sure does . 
  [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzirytrhbjw ) is spot on . 
  yeah , ~ ~ 206 ~ ~ 201 years ago lastly . 
  about ~ ~ 33 ~ ~ 28 years after 1776 . 
  edit : forgot norway , changed numbers . 
  if society gave a fuck about people they would n't have to turn into criminals and/or re-offend . 
  for a white supremacist i 'm sure that what you just said is just confirmation that white people are better . 
  i do n't think stormfronters are drawn to titles like this one ... 
  well , every murder is one too many ... 
  but our rate/capita is almost half of that of crotia for example . 
  only if the one making the claim is n't american . 
  americans can bash the us all they want , but show that you 're foreign and even the libertarians will take personal offense to legitimate worries about how their government acts . 
  strange , is n't it . 
  yep . 
  the us has nearly 5 % of the world population and account for about 25 % all inmates globally . 
  and as you said , they have about 8 times as many as china per capita ... `` something '' is off indeed . 
   i think there 's something off about that . 
  i agree ... 
  but in what way do you think something 's off ? 
  oh , you went * technical * . 
  i see . 
   `` being gay '' has never been a crime . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but you claim that homosexuality was never illegal in the uk ? 
  and i link a wikipedia article about the ** decriminalization of homosexuality ** in the uk . 
  are you interpreting the decriminalization as proof that it was never illegal ? 
  ^ ^ that ^ ^ would ^ ^ be ^ ^ strange anyway , have a read . 
   for most people the sixties was a time of sexual awakening and experimentation . 
  but it was n't until 1967 that gay and bisexual men could share that freedom . 
  on the 40th anniversary of the decriminalisation of homosexuality , we revisit the appallingly repressive atmosphere of the fifties and sixties that ruined lives , destroyed reputations and finally sparked a campaign for change http://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/jun/24/communities.gayrights, 
  well yes . 
  i 'm sure that the identity is already available on flashback . 
  i guess that the * sexual offences act 1967 * is just made-up . 
   the sexual offences act 1967 is an act of parliament in the united kingdom ( citation 1967 c. 60 ) . 
  it decriminalised homosexual acts in private between two men , both of whom had to have attained the age of 21 . 
  the act applied only to england and wales and did not cover the merchant navy or the armed forces . 
  homosexuality was decriminalised in scotland by the criminal justice ( scotland ) act 1980 and in northern ireland by the homosexual offences ( northern ireland ) order 1982 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sexual_offences_act_1967, 
   a few hours early . 
  actually , we almost never release the identity of the accused or even the convicted . 
  it 's not in the interest of the public to know such details . 
  actually , we average 1 murder/week . 
  we do n't do such things here , or very rarely at least . 
  basically we do it for the same reasons that reddit has similar rules . 
  we do n't need witch hunts , it 's not in the public interest to know the identity and innocent until proven guilty , at which time our legal system takes care of that . 
  the public need n't bother with these details , does n't do any good . 
  i do n't think the ** norwegian ** , whose flair is `` homogeneous oil money '' needs to do that ... 
  i think that ( s ) he was taking the american perspective . 
  `` ca n't ever have enough oil '', 
   where has it `` been in place '' for 10 years ? 
  i mean , r2p is an idea/concept that dates back to the 90s , and as the wiki article you linked clearly states , it is `` a proposed norm and not a law '' . 
  the idea of r2p is old , yes . 
  when i say `` been in place '' , i was referring to the 2005 world summit . 
   as the iciss report was released in 2001 , right around the time of the second gulf war , many thought that would be the end of this new norm . 
  however , at the 2005 world summit , where the largest number of heads of state and government in the history of the un convened , the r2p was unanimously adopted . 
  the 4 cases i 'm referring to are : * kenya , 2007/2008 * ivory coast , 2011 * libya , 2011 * central african republic , 2013 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/responsibility_to_protect#in_practice additionally :  the security council has reaffirmed its commitment to the r2p in several resolutions . 
  the first such resolution came in april 2006 , when the security council reaffirmed the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 in resolution 1674 , formalizing their support for the r2p . 
  in 2009 , the council again recognized states ' primary responsibility to protect and reaffirmed paragraphs 138 and 139 in resolution 1894 . 
   additionally , the security council has mentioned the r2p in several country-specific resolutions :  * darfur : resolution 1706 in 2006  * libya : resolution 1970 , resolution 1973 in 2011 , resolution 2016 in 2011 , and resolution 2040 in 2012  * c\u00f4te d'ivoire : resolution 1975 in 2011  * yemen : resolution 2014 in 2011  * mali : resolution 2085 in 2012 and resolution 2100 in 2013  * sudan and south sudan : resolution 1996 in 2011 and resolution 2121 in 2013 on a side note , i do n't disagree with these interventions . 
  also ...  is delivered to the places we buy it from in trucks . 
  how do you think things are delivered in europe , by serfs walking the never-ending alleys we call roads ? 
  our infrastructure is set up for driving , but it 's also built for alternatives , like biking or walking . 
  our fuel prices also encourage the expansion of the later mentioned infrastructure and better public transport . 
  as long as your prices remain low you have no incentive to build additional infrastructure for anything but roads , which is n't good . 
  well , i did state that `` of course this is n't possible because they hold the biggest stick '' ... 
  i 'm not advocating a military invasion of the us , just pointing out that , logically ( in accordance with r2p ) , the eu seems to have a responsibility to protect the american population from its government . 
  obviously the r2p is used to protect the general population . 
  the intention would be to save lives , not kill . 
  help you guys get some freedom and democracy . 
  thank you !, 
  so , you recognize isis as a sovereign nation ? 
  anyway , i do n't see the point of this discussion . 
  isis is an oil producing country now ? 
  and i 'm in no way suggesting making enemies of the us , just like the us is n't an enemy of afghanistan but a friend that 's there to help . 
  `` very rarely '' , i 'm not sure how often they 'd have to do it for it to be frequent . 
  it 's been in place for 10 years and has been used 4 times since , and has been suggested more times but has been vetoed in the unsc . 
  it was the previous comment who lumped them together . 
  yes , basically they do lose their voting rights , and i too consider that undemocratic . 
  especially if you consider that almost 1 % ( 704/100 ,000 of adults ) of their population are at any point imprisoned and that they have the largest prison population in the world . 
  yeah , fuel should be more expensive in the us . 
  since we do this in europe to decrease emissions and to get public funds . 
  let 's not piss off isis , we should just let them do thing their own way . 
  as we should with the us , that will surely lead to a good world for everyone . 
  yeah , seriously . 
  the us is among the worst among industrialized countries in the world on human rights . 
   the united states has a vibrant civil society and strong constitutional protections for many basic rights . 
  yet , particularly in the areas of criminal justice , immigration , and national security , us laws and practices routinely violate rights .

  ) , but it is from a rather dark place , and it is a tad rich of turkey to call us out on human rights . 
  but the eu has a deal . 
  if i get sick ( emergency of course not some planned operation , cancer etc ) on vacation in spain , i get treated for free , just like a spanish person on vacation get treated for free in my country . 
  a country ca n't just decide to abandon that deal if you have signed it . 
   i agree with the former ( that turkey needs to deal with the baggage of the past ) though there is currently no negative attitude towards turkish armenians from the majority ( there are exceptions and minor groups , of course , as there would be ) . 
  so , why are is turkey not admitting it ? 
  why are they even asking other countries not to admit it ? 
  i must say , the * current * turkish attidtude towards a * genocide * the turks committed is appalling , to say the least . 
  where is the apologies , the public recognition of the suffering etc. 
  it is even forbidden in turkey . 
   and yes , turkey has been attempting to deal with the discrimination of kurds to the point of going into official talks with the terrorist group . 
  but the majority of the kurds are not terrorists , and it was just until recently they * could have schools with their own languange . 
  why on earth have you denied them this for so long . 
  are all official documents in kurdish ? 
  do you have a lot of kurdish ministers , ambassadors etc ? 
  is the economic discriminiation that for example the un mentioned over ? 
  are they treated as absolute equals , in all sense ? 
  you do not seem to understand that they have lived in your country forever , but you see them as some foreign part . 
   would you like to compare these demands with minority groups and immigrants in europe ? 
  i think you have to specify the minority group and the country , and be more exakt . 
  obviously , how russia and iceland deals with immigrants might be quite different, 
  do n't they post this every week ? 
  i know i have seen it four-five times here in r/europe . 
  have turkey admitted to the armenian genocide yet ? 
  that to me was a not `` embracing of tolerances '' to put it mildly . 
  if turkey wanted to live as they speak , they should admit to that . 
  also , is turkey attempting to deal with the discrimination of kurds ? 
  well , it is about time that germany got an anti euro party as well , several other countries have them . 
  i hope this will lead to more discussions in germany about the euro . 
   if the `` giips '' have their own currency , they can devaluate it . 
  that 's the traditional way to adjust for competitive gradient . 
  a way that is not available to `` the south '' because countries like germany are also aboard and do n't want that true , and they need it . 
  however , it has never forced them to do reforms before , they just kept devaluating . 
  what is different now ? 
  they would also have enormous interest rates and inflation , a whole new set of problems . 
   for the sake of the argument , let us assume `` the south '' fixes it 's problems and actually becomes more competitive than germany . 
  now what . 
  competitiveness differences are always going to drive a thrust through a single currency . 
  personally , i am ok with giving away a few percents of individual income ( not of gdp , that 's prolly more ) a year to keep europe going . 
  i feel that it 's worth it . 
  when it comes to a dozen percents , maybe not though ... well , greece , southern italy and spain has been on the receiving end since forever , 80 's at least or 60 's for some of them . 
  what has happened with the billions they have receive ? 
  you seem to assume that they would be like the ddr , or the estonians , immediately trying to become competitive after years of hardship . 
  you forget that they have had the chance , for decades , to become as competitive , but not taken it ( maybe spain/portugal a bit ) . 
  it is something built into the system . 
  even now , with the backs against the wall , italy refuse necessary reforms , and greece have n't even implemented half of the stuff from * the first bailout * . 
  it does n't work that you give them some money and they become competitive . 
  if that were the case , it would have happend . 
  instead , you take them on to support them for the forseeable future . 
  even with countries that does want to change - take ddr as an example . 
  brd has pumped * trillions * into it , and it is still not as competitive as brd , 23 years after the fact . 
  and , they still receive over $ 100 billions/year ( i looked it up :-) so , what you will take on is giving money to the south , for at least 30-40 years , probably forever , since the culture . 
  and , it will be double digit of your gdp , no doubts . 
  ddr/brd , ratio was 20 million/60 million . 
  south/north is 145/180 , and that is if france take full responsibility , but they are in trouble as well . 
  so sending 25 % of your gdp south for the next 50 years ? 
  how does that sound ? 
   why not have the transfers . 
  yes , that is going to be extremely unpopular . 
  but i feel the alternative is the breakup of the euro , something germany can not afford . 
  you are correct in your analysis btw , as far as i can tell . 
  can you afford supporting southern europe forever ? . 
  breaking up the euro is expensive , but then you are out and can control your destiny . 
  supporting the south for forever is a slow , and very expensive death . 
  in the end , sending double digits of gdp south will always be more expensive . 
   and i really hope the euro will be saved . 
  there is idealistic motivations for this , from somebody who just wants everybody to get along . 
  and there is economic motivations . 
  i think the importance of the euro to an economy which exports a lot into the eurozone can not be underestimated . 
  we can pour a lot of money into this thing and still come out in the black . 
  which may be part of the problem  i understand that you want to save the euro , but which euro ? 
  the euro that is in yours , and other idealistic peoples head ( not that it is anything wrong with dreams ) or the real euro ? 
  why do you want a euro , where a treaty is not more worth than toilet paper ? 
  how can you built upon that ? 
  do n't you agree that everyone has to follow the treaty ? 
  or , write a new one . 
  so , if you want to save it , you should have answers to how to start following the treaty or write a new one . 
  hint - none of the two can happen in the next decade , at least . 
  do you think the ez can ignore treaties forever ? 
  we need to vote , and then i can guarantee it will be a sound no to sending more money south . 
  and , the alternative is not letting us vote . 
  that is not a true alternative either . 
  if you truly believe in the euro , you need to have a democratic euro , where one follows the law . 
  that actually rules this one out , does n't it ? 
  also , the advantages of the euro seems to be overestimated . 
  finland did a bit better than sweden , the first 5 years . 
  however , it has been doing worse since 2008 , and they have to borrow more . 
  do n't think the finns do n't know this . 
  of course , economics it is not like math ( several different reasons ) , but it is becoming harder and harder for the finns to defend the euro because of its advantages . 
  there is a reason that the true finns , who wants to quit the euro are the 3rd biggest party 820 % ) . 
  also , for the future - you can never ever get the finns to pay 25 % of their gdp for the next 40 years , not while the swedes and danes sits there laughing , counting our kronor . 
  which brings me really to the most important point , something that everyone seems to have lost sight off . 
  a currency union is supposed to be beneficial , to bring advantages . 
  i do n't think the euro , in its current form is bringing any advantages for anyone . 
  short run , the north , but in the long run you will loose to . 
  countries are supposed to want to be in ones , not fight to stay out ( sweden , poland etc ) . 
  the euro is n't anything a good currency union should be . 
  it lacks the integration and the transfer mechanism , the bank union , the debt pooling . 
  and , it does n't care about any law , rules and regulations . 
  no wonder it is failing .

  it was the last time any swedish government ignored a referendum on any issue . 
  they still technically have the right to , though , since all referendums in sweden are considered to be `` advisory '' rather than binding , but these days the media shitstorm that would surely follow makes it a practical impossibility . 
  blast !, 
  ok guys , they are onto us . 
  might as well say * adios * to the donkey . 
  time for plan dos . 
   gigantic sombrero-wearing straw donkey . 
  sombreros are n't spanish ( at least not the kind of sombreros the word refers to in english . ), 
   the sentence should be just and fair , proportional to the crime he did commit , but that does not mean that the judge should shake hands with him , or he should be let to boast about his theories . 
  or that he should do a raised hand salute . 
  there are subtle differences in treating someone in a humane way , but still restraining him . 
  breivik has the same rights to be heard as anyone else . 
  if he choses to use that opportunity to spout a bunch of insane crap then that 's his choice . 
  i 'll agree that shaking hands with the judge is a bit much , though . 
  judges should not shake hands with anyone involved in a criminal case ( or they should shake hands with everyone ; the important thing is that they are impartial . ), 
   as it stands now , breivik is quite happy with his situation and with the possible outcome of the trial . 
  he does not regret killing those people , seems like he achieved his goal . 
  a happy mass murderer . 
  way to go norway . 
  what 's the point of punishing him then , and what will hold back the next breivik from doing the same ? 
  the point is n't to punish him . 
  the point is to rehabilitate him so that he does not do it again , so that he becomes a regular , well-adjusted citizen . 
  obviously for people like breivik that 's impossible , but then that 's because they are insane and they need to be locked up and cared for by professionals . 
  being cruel to him does n't solve anything , and if you think you can scare other extremists off by making an example of one individual then you are the one who 's deluded . 
   i 'm waiting for the sentence , but i 'm also expecting that the victims relatives will be demonstrating . 
  you can `` play nice '' with breivik for the sake of civilizedness and principles , but what he did has already destroyed that aura . 
  some countries do have organized far right movements , but still would not find anyone willing to do what breivik did . 
  so in the end , you are just deluding yourself with that attitude . 
  well , that 's your way of looking at it , and i think you are wrong . 
  first about there being any sort of demonstrations , unless the court decides on a ridiculously mild sentence ( which they are n't : he 's going to get life in prison , or life in a criminal psychiatric institution . ), 
  i get the vibe that you are looking for a death sentence here , yes ? 
  well , norway , like most of the rest of civilised world , does n't execute people . 
  it 's illegal , and quite likely against the norwegian constitution ( not sure about this , though ) to deliver a death sentence . 
  it 's not going to happen . 
  secondly about my `` attitude '' . 
  i 'm not deluding myself here , because i do realise that the humane system used by the nordic countries in all things criminal and justice related is not perfect or without its faults ( but i 'll add that they do seem to be working a lot better than what many other countries are doing if you look to violent crimes levels overall . ), 
  but there are principles involved that are more important than petty vengence or practicality . 
  those principles are built on ideals of humane and yes sometimes even kind treatment of the criminally convicted or indeed everyone on the idea that they too are people and that they despite their faults still are a part of and have something to offer society , and that ultimately they are no less important than anyone else . 
  you may criticise these principles if you 'd like , but breaking them would be tantamount to going against everything that the society in question is built upon , and that 's simply not worth doing for someone as pitiful as breivik ( plus it 's exactly those principles that he so despised in the first place that it drove him to his actions . 
  giving in and abandoning those principles is exactly what he wants norway to do . ), 
  plus , like i said : theoretically speaking breivik is still innocent and should be treated as such . 
  that sounds an awful lot like something breivik would say . 
  what 's the point of having a justice system if it is n't fair and just ? 
  remember , breivik has n't been convicted yet . 
  technically speaking he 's still considered to be innocent , as his guilt has yet to be proven and determined in court . 
  they * have * to treat him humanely as there 's still a possibility , however slim , that he might be judged not guilty . 
  as for having more consideration for the accused than the victims : good . 
  a justice system should not be built on revenge and mob mentality , but rather on societal utility and principle , one of which should always be that the rights of the accused must be respected . 
  to quote one of his victims : `` he lost , and we won . '', 
  `` we '' ca n't win if he is not awarded the same rights as anyone else , or he 'll have succeeded in changing society for the more brutal . 
  but do n't you worry . 
  breivik will be sentenced soon enough . 
  but then you might not appreciate the humane methods of the norwegian prison system ... 
  it 's a bit more complex than that . 
  cyprus is home to two major ethnic groups , and they do n't get along very well . 
  both groups have a history of attempting to ethnically cleanse each other from the island ( and several other areas where the two groups coexist or used to coexist ) . 
  even today a unification is pretty much a practical impossibility because of it . 
  that 's not to say the cypriots could not work towards having that final goal at some point , but if it were to unconditionally happen today there 'd be a humanitarian crisis and tragedy as a consequence . 
  there might be an exception out there somewhere but no , just us nordics ( worldwide even , i believe ) . 
  it 's only really the nordic countries that do the whole `` no fees higher education ( as long as you are from the eu/ees ) '' thing . 
  elsewhere in the eu you 'll still have to pay tuition ( though it tends to be partly subsidised at least ) . 
  i 'll take that bet , but alas being swedish i have no euros . 
  will 10 krona suffice ? 
  so in the interest of remembering the tragic oppression of his own people he seeks to oppress another people by forbidding the very mention of their existence ? 
  i mean , it would be one thing if it was verified that the specific people that were being remembered here were all nazis themselves , but not all germans were nazis back then , like i said . 
  if these german soldiers were forced to fight and die against their own will for a cause they did n't believe in then saying their suffering should be ignored because of their nationality is downright racist ( or well , maybe not racist exactly , but you get my point . ), 
  are they * nazi * german soldiers , like graves for people who were actually serving in the ss , or are they just generic german ( wehrmacht ) soldier graves ? 
  i could see the argument against the first but the latter ... not so much . 
  you do n't * know * they are nazis . 
  lots of germans were drafted into the army in ww2 , not all of them agreed with hitler . 
  their deaths need to be remembered as much as those of the holocaust ( though maybe not for the same reasons ) . 
  true enough . 
  the 40 % that did n't vote clearly do n't care either way . 
   led 6.97 % of them to that conclusion that fascists were the right path for our future . 
  ftfy, 
   so has the right . 
  yes . 
  exactly . 
  authoritarianism is coincidental to right and left . 
    and so did hitler and mussolini , very much on the right on many social issues , and on economy topics , too . 
  the labelling of fascism and nazism as right-wing ideologies is one of the main exceptions to the whole economic thing . 
  originally though they presented themselves as the `` third way '' , another alternative beyond the right and the left of the day . 
  i suppose we started calling them right simply because they were so staunchly against communism and socialism but willing to work with conservatives ( but they also hated liberalism , so there 's that ) . 
   having said that , i think we agree on the main picture ... let 's not stress about the details . 
   well , i 'm certainly not interested in having another pointless discussion about the merits of various ideologies , right or left , so yes , let 's do that . 
  yeah , and they each have their own native cultures and ways and peoples that are different from each other . 
  that 's exactly the point i was trying to make : there 's no actual single british culture . 
  there are several different british culture * s * plural , but the british islands were never monocultural . 
  the people talking about how you need to drop the multicultural society and go back to what 's properly `` british '' are no different from the 19th century englishman talking about how the irish had to give up their uncivilised ways in favour of his own because theirs ' was unacceptable to him ( well , at least not in attitude . ), 
  the way i see it the left-right scale is way too simplistic to accurately label anything . 
  a more complex system with more than one axis would be necessary for that . 
  but that said i do think that the left-right scale still has a lot more to do with economy than it has to do with social attitudes . 
  like you say that stalin was as authoritarian as hitler and blatantly anti-democratic , but that has nothing to do with his views on market control . 
  we label communists left all the time , yet that ideology has produced some of the worst authoritarians of all time . 
  the reason we still call the commies leftist is because they want a centralised control economy . 
  the whole association of the left with social liberalism is coincidental to the economic aspects that is the core of any such ideology . 
  as an example coming from the opposite end of the spectra you 'd never call libertrarianism a left-wing ideology , because of its ultimate goal of a complete laissez-faire economy , but it 's very much against authoritarianism and for social liberalism ( much more so than most left-wing schools that share that trait , i might add ) , traits that you seemed to imply are decidedly left-wing in nature . 
  i would rather posit that such issues are irrelevant to the right-left scale which mostly relates to the economic opinions of an ideology or a group of people ( though obviously there 's more to it than that , as we think of the nazis as far-right yet economically speaking they were pretty restrictive and controlling . ), 
  are we swedes really all that `` lagom '' these days ? 
  i think we might need a new word .

  the bap qra ( manned by denmark at the time ) scrambled two f16 to intercept a 6 ship formation of russian fighter/strike aircraft who had violated swedish airspace . 
  we had no qra on readiness at that time ( night time during the easter ) weirdly enough . 
  i 'm more than happy to have a discussion based on facts , but if you 're gon na go with some sputnik level conspiracy theories i 'm just gon na ask you to fuck off , sincerely !, 
  hit me up if you want some tinfoil to that tinfoil hat of yours . 
  you 're missing the point . 
  all decision making in nato is based on consensus , hence you need consensus within the organisation in order for nato as an alliance to do something . 
  nato ca n't control what the u.s. does outside the alliance , such as the iraq invasion ( which to clarify was n't a nato operation in any way ) . 
  i do n't know where you got all that shit from , but it 's completely wrong . 
  difference being the context of the violations , two of the u.s. violations were by civilian planes , and one by a rc-135 which turned away after being asked to do so by air traffic control . 
  they have also initiated talks with our mfa in order to avoid similar incidents in the future . 
  russia never acknowledges or apologises for it 's violations , violations which at least once have taken place whilst conducting exercises simulating strikes on targets in sweden ( 29th of march , 2013 ) . 
  way to go !, 
  we did n't discuss what the u.s. has done , we discussed the nato presence in eastern europe . 
  and no , nato is not a platform for the u.s. to project it 's power . 
  all decision making in nato is based on consensus , which gives every members a kind of veto . 
  you might also want to take a look at how two prominent nato members , france and germany were some of the most prominent critics of the iraq invasion . 
  a 6 ship formation of russian fighter/strike aircraft violated our airspace during an exercise simulating a nuclear strike back in 2013 . 
  a pretty deliberate incursion , given how the entire formation entered swedish airspace . 
  if that 's not a case of russia violating sovereign airspace i do n't know what is . 
  there 's a reason why most eastern european countries are members of nato , and the reason is 50 + years of constantly being raped and oppressed by russia . 
  as long as russia 's waving it 's dick around , breaking international agreements and invading and annexing territory from it 's neighbours , nato have every reason to be present in russias neighbouring countries . 
  it 's not like nato annexed or forced these countries into the alliance , they all choose to join . 
  plus russia signed an agreement with nato back in 1997 , an agreements in which russia agrees that everyone is free to join nato . 
  yet they whine like a bunch of 5th graders about being surrounded and shit . 
  here 's parts of the agreement : `` to achieve the aims of this act , nato and russia will base their relations on a shared commitment to the following principles : - development , on the basis of transparency , of a strong , stable , enduring and equal partnership and of cooperation to strengthen security and stability in the euro-atlantic area ; - acknowledgement of the vital role that democracy , political pluralism , the rule of law , and respect for human rights and civil liberties and the development of free market economies play in the development of common prosperity and comprehensive security ; - refraining from the threat or use of force against each other as well as against any other state , its sovereignty , territorial integrity or political independence in any manner inconsistent with the united nations charter and with the declaration of principles guiding relations between participating states contained in the helsinki final act ; - ** respect ** ** for ** ** sovereignty ** , ** independence ** ** and ** ** territorial ** ** integrity ** ** of ** ** all ** ** states ** ** and ** ** their ** ** inherent ** ** right ** ** to ** ** choose ** ** the ** ** means ** ** to ** ** ensure ** ** their ** ** own ** ** security ** , the inviolability of borders and peoples ' right of self-determination as enshrined in the helsinki final act and other osce documents ; - mutual transparency in creating and implementing defence policy and military doctrines ; - prevention of conflicts and settlement of disputes by peaceful means in accordance with un and osce principles ; - support , on a case-by-case basis , of peacekeeping operations carried out under the authority of the un security council or the responsibility of the osce . '', 
  or russia could stop behaving like a whiny 12 year old who 's provoked by everything and everyone . 
  that pilot 's gon na be flying a cargo plane full of rubber dog shit to hong kong . 
  one could also argue that russia 's the one creating unnecessary tensions in the baltic sea , tensions that forces the u.s. to support their nato allies in the region . 
  the baltic states has even requested an increased u.s. presence in the region , and why could that be ? 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but i 've yet to see or hear anything about non russian fighter jets doing flybys less than 30 feet of vessels belonging to a country you 're their not exactly friends with . 
  `` we 're totally objective and neutral on all matters '', 
  agreed , the recurrent semi-sarcastic comment on how doomsday 's coming and shit are pretty annoying . 
  i share the concern about the matter , but that shit 's just pessimistic as fuck and destructive ( in lack of a better word ) towards the overall discussion , it would be nice to have a filter . 
  every time i scroll sweddit someone 's reminding me about how bad shit is , which i know , i do n't need to be reminded of it every second hour or so by a link to fria tider . 
  i agree with you to some extent , you ca n't go on / r/sweden without encountering masses of posts related to immigration , something which has grown to be quite annoying . 
  concerning the racism part our perceptions differ , the concern about immigration is understandable , and there 's not to much racism ( in the actual sense of the notion ) going on . 
  there is some bullshit , but just ignore it if it bothers you . 
  straight out racism usually gets downvoted anyway . 
  where can i get a toy saddam ? 
  well that 's fucking retarded . 
  this have yet to be implemented anywhere else as far as i know , and you 're completely free to voice your opinions on immigration without having measures taken against you , as opposed to what you implied in the earlier post . 
  do you have a source ? 
  because i have n't heard anything about it , seems straight out illegal to take measures against a student for voicing his opinions on immigration . 
  this is like the 10th time this has been posted in less than a week ... 
  always had a thing for the baltics , fucking depressing what the russian turned parts of it into . 
  understandable . 
  would the 30 % refer to the russian minority ? 
  i 've been told the integration of them has n't been without problems . 
  not even sure if your average joe within in said subculture knowns what any of those things actually means . 
  they are n't a particularly academic bunch , i 'd guess they use it `` because it 's cool '' . 
  `` we 're no racist cowboys . 
  to us the confederate flag is a rebellious symbol as we aim to free ourselves from the norms of the society and powers in general . 
  the music we listen to and our car culture is native to the american south . 
  hence the relevance of the confederate flag . '', 
  - [ the hard on for the american south as described by a raggare . 
  quite surprised you got them as well , given how you barely accept any immigrants at all . 
  [ these guys ] ( http://www.pinupsandkustoms.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/raggare-ett-nordiskt-fenomen-image-4.jpg ) , commonly known as `` raggare '' . 
  not really . 
  poland has less than half your population and a much smaller gdp , yet they still have 120 000 active service members ( you have just under 180 000 ) and are n't to far behind you in terms of vehicles and other material . 
  plus i 've worked with german units , these billions are n't anywhere to be seen according to the guys i spoke with . 
  my guess would be that you 've fallen into the same shit as we have . 
  spending billions on shit that never reaches the units nor contributes to operational efficiency . 
  i 'm unsure wether or not its an obligation or a recommendation . 
  what i objected to was your statement about how germany spends four times as much on military expenses as poland , which yet again does n't mean anything given the fact that your gdp is larger than polands . 
  the obligation/recommendation exists to make sure that every member state provides the alliance with as much as 2 % of their gdp ( or more ) can offer . 
  you seem to be missing out on what the nato requirement means . 
  it 's not about how much money you spend in $ , but how much of your gdp you spend . 
  and the nato requirement is as you may know 2 % . 
  spending 2 % on military expenses hurts polands wallet just as much as it would hurt your . 
  yes , because your gdp 's bigger than polands . 
  dude at 0:22 got it . 
  that has to be the most farfetched and bizarre comparison i 've seen for a very long time . 
  there is undoubtedly some fucked up shit going on in the cultural sector and on some universities . 
  but being reported for something does n't mean anything , any idiot can report someone for literally anything . 
  most of this bullshit is ridiculed by anyone with half a brain as well . 
  individuals reporting bullshit exists everywhere and happens all the time , nothing will happen juridically . 
  one individual reported a teacher for a bullshit reason = parody of a country . 
  totally makes sense . 
  never . 
  but there are , as i suppose you know , other ways to distinguish hostlie intents . 
  a drastic increase of intelligence gathering carried out by russian autorites towards both sensitive military and civilian infrastructure , air force exercises aimed at targets in sweden , aggressive behaviour towards swedish aircraft in international airspace , testing our qra 's reaction time recurrently , and violations of our airspace so intentional it 's embarrassing . 
  the reason for this ? 
  the strategic importance of gotland , to give you a hint . 
  russia 's doing that just fine by themselves , no need for the u.s. to spend time or resources on it . 
  sure , he want `` peace '' with russia , but on what terms ? 
  european security certainly is n't a priority for him . 
  while he might land some sweet agreement with his new best pall in the kremlin , europe is left to it 's own with russia , completely lacking the deterring factor that the u.s. presence and commitment provided . 
  and no , hillary do n't want war with russia . 
  i do n't like her and i do n't want her , but come on . 
  the u.s. and russia have completely opposite interests regarding security , and they have obligations ( which they have been quite keen on emphasising recently ) to assist in the defence of europe , just as any other nato member . 
  if taking your security interests ( as opposed to some appeasement bullshit ) and obligations seriously makes you a war monger , i 'd rather just call it quits and end this discussion here . 
  if you 're looking for an argument against him , how the fuck is he supposed to get mexico to pay for his wall ? 
  it 's his fucking idea , how about he fund it himself ? 
  other than that , he 's a grave risk for security and stability in europe . 
  his positive attitude towards putin combined with his scepticism towards nato will destabilise the entire alliance and potentially withdraw the most potent and deterring factor in nato , the u.s. military . 
  even with the european nato members spending the recommended 2 % , the baltics will still be in a bad spot . 
  combine this with fucking up relations with china and you 'll have a new hotspot in the pacific , plus a china more likely to turn towards russia . 
  ** edit : ** shutting down parts of the internet and killing terrorists families might not be a good idea either . 
  well , there has been isis cells attempting to establish themselves in the pa. 
  thank the israeli security services for said attempts being thwarted .

   what is the catholic church if not an indoctrination ? 
  depends on whether you ask a catholic or an atheist . 
   what it really is : `` gender and sex are not the same , for the vast majority of people they happen to be the same but for some they 're not . 
  well , it does n't just * happen * to be the same . 
  it 's guided by biology and is evolutionarily `` supposed '' to be the same , but sometimes that does n't happen . 
  better that the pot says it than everyone ignoring it . 
  motivations matter . 
  is he against it because he does n't think women are capable of spirituality or is he against it because he figures that if the traditions are n't broken , do n't fix them ? 
  the latter ends up screwing over women , but not on purpose . 
  probably not . 
  the fact that this sort of happened and got media attention is a win for him . 
  western media making fun of him plays right into his hand . 
  germans ca n't vote for him anyway , so he does n't care what they think . 
  it also does n't matter if millions of turks who were n't going to vote for him regardless think he 's an idiot . 
  as long as it makes `` his '' people support him more , it 's a good move . 
  catastrophic for who ? 
  if the goal is to help yourself rather than the country , seemingly idiotic moves can actually be very clever . 
  i think 90 % of his `` idiot '' image is that he 's just a terrible public speaker . 
  put anyone in front of tv cameras broadcasting to the whole world and they 'd also get a bunch of words and facts wrong . 
  he certainly * also * did some idiotic things , but mostly he just could n't speak in front of a crowd . 
  he 's sort of the opposite of obama . 
  it 's autumn now so it starts with what it currently looks like ? 
   it 's a mental shortcut . 
  but it 's one that does n't work at all here . 
  it 's a shortcut that ** only ** works if everyone already agrees that something is bad . 
  as an argument , all it does is make it look like you do n't have any rational reason for believing what you do . 
  you shoot yourself in the foot every time you use it . 
  this is starting to sound like a pretty sweet deal . 
   why should ' t i try to stop her ? 
  because abortions are only legal early on , and at that point the `` baby '' has the mental development of a carrot . 
  the fetus is technically human , but only in the `` dna analysis would confirm it '' sense , and it 's not recognizable as a baby . 
  it becomes a question of who exactly it is that you 're trying to help and why . 
   arguments used in agitation are simplified ... 
  this is n't simplified - it 's just not an argument at all . 
  it 's about as relevant as saying that the sky is blue and therefore we must get what we want . 
  referring to the year only works if everyone already agrees that one option is some inevitable bright future and the other is a dark past that we should move away from . 
  but the fact that everyone * does n't * agree on that is the whole reason there 's a debate . 
  do n't forget the stylish hats and fancy boots . 
  400 years of okay . 
  there would n't really be any warning they could pass down that would n't have faded into obscure ( and very vague ) doomsday prophecies foretelling 1500 years of horrors , followed by a golden age greater than any that came before . 
  no love for the swedish grenade launcher industry ? 
  you 've got both the [ carl gustaf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_gustaf_recoilless_rifle ) and the [ at4 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/at4 ) . 
  states usually do n't get any veto either . 
  most of the time in politics , * no one * has a veto . 
  providing the streams , yes . 
  but watching the streams ? 
  it makes things very awkward considering that you might not know if something is streamed illegally or not when watching it . 
  and if a tv channel were to accidentally broadcast a video clip they do n't have the rights to , millions of people would suddenly be criminals . 
  leaning to de lft , indeed . 
   this is one of those issues where democracy fails . 
  definitely . 
  this is basically people using the law to force their religious beliefs on others . 
  there are certainly those who stand against it in some countries . 
  in sweden ( which is reintroducing conscription ) , a majority is in favor of equal conscription . 
   women live on average 8 years longer than men . 
  depends on where you are . 
  it varies a lot from country to country . 
  in some places , there 's barely any difference . 
  no , but the gun was n't involved until after he was already tied up . 
  it would have played out the same even without the gun . 
  not when you 're tied up . 
  which he was . 
  which you would know if you had read the article . 
  according to the article , yes . 
  it 's mentioned at least twice . 
  not if you 're already tied up . 
  no one is saying that war is peace . 
  everyone agrees that it would be much nicer if everyone could just get along and live in peace and harmony . 
  but it 's quite clear from both history and ongoing events that it 's not going to actually happen . 
  so you go with the lesser evil . 
  would not allowing the guard to carry a gun result in this guy being threatened less ? 
  do you really care if someone is threatening to kill you with a gun or a knife ? 
  if you could go back a month and revoke the rights to carry guns , would any relevant part of this story have played out differently ? 
  would banning the guns actually have helped anyone ? 
  it 's certainly not legal , but the guy was already tied up and they could have threatened him with a knife or whatever . 
  hell , they could have gone to the store to buy a knife to threaten him with . 
  he was n't going anywhere . 
  the gun itself was n't really relevant . 
  maybe he knows arabic ? 
  no , that 's ask an american who will then pretend to be representative of the rest of the world . 
  sometimes they do . 
  seemingly not always , and usually the system is only on for a few months in winter . 
  but you can use them to turn it off completely if you want to freeze . 
  the point is to teach you how to be a soldier . 
  you 'll then be forced to actually * do * something in the event of war . 
  but the service itself is educational . 
  you do n't produce anything or provide any service . 
  they sort of are . 
  parents have to ensure that their kids go to school , and if they do n't then they 'll eventually lose custody . 
  meaning the kid ends up in an orphanage . 
  you could run away , but in the end your options are going to school or living as a homeless fugitive . 
  it 's about the same level of coercion , and in both cases the purpose is to teach you things . 
  elementary schools ? 
  you have to go there , it dominates your life for a decade , and you 're expected to behave and perform or they 'll keep you there even longer . 
  you 'll be expected to learn things , perform basic manual labor , and participate in physical exercise . 
  you show up when they tell you to , eat what they feed you , and go home when they let you . 
  you probably wo n't die , but that goes for military service too . 
  in the event of an invasion , no one is safe . 
   do as i say , or i 'll arrest you and put you in prison !, 
  is n't this pretty much all legislation ever ?

  45 % of illegal immigrants in america come via plane . 
  you know why ? 
  cheap labour . 
  the reason those people come in over and over again is because the gop is dominated by its donor interests , which love cheap labour , and the dems are dominated by ethnic pressure groups like la raza which does n't even want to allow people calling illegal immigrants ... illegal immigrants . 
  `` undocumented workers '' or whatever the neologism they prefer . 
  so , to go back to my previous point , america is not a good guide here , because your political parties have been corrupted and dominated by special interests who both conspire to have a porous border ( money for donors on the gop side and a reliable voter bank for the dems ) . 
  in europe , money plays a much lower part in politics than in america . 
  our ethnic pressure groups , while there , are also far weaker . 
  for us , the bigger problem is just the general attitude that doing anything serious about it is ` racism ' . 
  the far-right will never come to power , but they do have a way of wakening up the mainstream from their snooze . 
  that certainly happened to the sdp recently in austria . 
  also , if we do have a pressure group on immigration in europe then it 's probably the v4 . 
  but that kind of pressure group is n't doing damage , rather it 's blunting it . 
   if you want it to stop , you have to close up how they get back . 
  nah , you can make it stop by a series of ways . 
  first , amend the pull factors . 
  secondly , destroy any chances of getting to stay illegally . 
  these are harder to push through than you think . 
  merkel tried but the greens are pushing at her most far-reaching proposals . 
  finally , some of us * do * want to see some refugee migration , but we want it to be like what the british have proposed , which is to do the vetting on-site and thus be sure that the people coming are a ) not a threat and b ) not economic migrants but genuine refugees . 
  that kind of system could work , but only if it is done on a system-wide level ( eu that is ) and relatively small-scale . 
  while i hold out hope , right now it looks like it is still every man for himself . 
  we 'd probably need a new treaty to fix this . 
   australia takes immigrants , not refugees . 
  i 'm aware . 
  which is why i wrote :  we should have moved to an australian/canadian system back then i pointed out that the sheer numbers is in of itself not an issue . 
  australia 's net migration rate is higher than ours . 
  what matters is * quality * . 
  sweden also has a very high-tech economy , which means that the threshold for entry is very high for immigrants coming here . 
  only the swiss is more demanding of its workers ' skills in the oecd . 
  `` immigrant countries '' is utter tripe . 
  i already wrote down below that if sweden took in the kind of immigrants that australia takes - high-skill asians - then we would n't have any issues with integration at all . 
  the east asian/indian migrants we have are fitting in without zero problems . 
  i do n't buy the mythological bs about `` nation of immigrants '' . 
  at all . 
  it 's all about the kind of immigration system you have . 
  if you bring in people with the economic skills + cultural values that fits in , integration will solve itself . 
  it 's not harder than that . 
  if sweden took in high-skilled asian immigrants , we would n't have any problems at all . 
  in fact , the asian immigrants we do have ( thai , chinese , philippines , indian ) are very well integrated . 
  people overrate culture and the whole `` nation of immigrants '' bs . 
  it 's just total bullshit . 
  if you take in mostly high-skill asians , you 're going to succeed . 
  it 's not harder than that . 
  rest is footnotes . 
  i find that hard to believe . 
  source ? 
  it 's not bad , but slovakia 's economy is even better . 
  their productivity growth is better and so is their current account . 
  their growth rate is about equal , despite slovakia having a nominal gdp per capita significantly above poland 's . 
  poland has n't had a year of negative growth for 25 years , so it 's not like it has been doing badly , but if you compare the irish experience or the korean experience , its convergence has been far slower , but nevertheless certainly above the vast majority of developing countries . 
  east poland !, 
  disagree . 
  australia takes in far more per capita than we do . 
  it 's not so much quanitity than what kind of people you take in . 
  sweden has the 2nd lowest share of low-skill jobs in the oecd . 
  many of the refugees who come are often semi-illiterate . 
  there was a time when you could find a lot of jobs for those kind of people in sweden , it was called the 1960s . 
  tbh , the current system should have been scrapped decades ago and we should have moved to an australian/canadian system back then , but swedish debate has always been hysterical on all social issues , not just immigration . 
  another great example is the inability to calmly discuss feminism in sweden without being yelled at and slurred . 
  so the necessary debate was postponed until we literally hit a wall . 
  i doubt many have still learned the lesson tbh . 
  germany got fucking lucky because the suicide bomber was a bloody idiot . 
  if he had any competence , dozens of people would have died . 
  think a big blast in the middle of a crowd in a festival . 
  the lesson learned here is that once you get a rejected application * and you 're known to the police as a danger * , you should n't be allowed to move freely but be shipped back asap or put in somekind of detention camp until you can be deported . 
  let 's hope people wo n't have to pay with their lives for germany to learn this lesson . 
  to be fair , how overrepresented has a 5 % religious minority been in terrorist attacks over the past year ? 
  you make it sound as if it completely proportional , when it is far , far from the case . 
   allahu akbar  do n't start chanting terrorist slogans the swastika is not a racist symbol , because it has become that anyway in many people 's ignorant minds because they do n't know the deep roots of the symbol . 
  the phrase in question is not a ` terrorist slogan ' , it 's merely been hijacked by terrorists and people should know better to differentiate . 
   and with the `` relatinship-crime '' , is just cited the words ( by clumsily translating them ) . 
  used by the police fine  no , terrorism is an attack to cause terror which is what he did by attacking scores of innocent bystandards . 
  just calling that `` running amok '' does n't cut it . 
  you might say he did n't plan it , but its the result that counts . 
  once innocents are attacked randomly , would n't you say it crosses the threshold for a possible terror attack ? 
  not every terrorist has to be superideological to spread panic , or even plan it . 
  what goes through someone 's mind to kill one person and then turn on 5 others ? 
  if it was * only * about the relation , then it would only be her and then he 'd flee . 
  yet he did n't - and went after scores of others . 
  that changes the equation . 
  he * did * have breivik as his profile pic on whatsapp . 
  that is a fact . 
  that does n't happen by accident . 
  how many people would have a pic of a mass murderer as their profile picture ? 
  obviously only if you admire him and what he stands for . 
  why would you even try to deny that ? 
  there is an iranian fringe who believe in the aryan theory , and who believe that islam is a foreign religion by a foreign/hostile race ( arabs ) and that the * true * aryan religion is zoroastrian . 
  while i doubt he was religious , there are no reasons not to believe he did n't see himself as aryan . 
  if you are pro-breivik , you have to hate islam . 
  convenient of you to leave out the nazi slur . 
  sure there are similarities , in that both are totalitarian , but nazism belives in racial purity and communism in the struggle and the eventual dictatorship of the working classes and explicit anti-racism . 
  please educate yourself . 
  http://www.politico.eu/article/gunther-oettinger-no-visa-waiver-for-turkey-this-year-coup-recep-tayyip-erdogan/ they are only willing to rule it out for no more than a year . 
  even despite all the post-coup fallout . 
  what makes you think it wo n't happen in the next 20 ? 
  i 'd say it 's overwhelmingly likely to happen within the next 24 months . 
   local communist  no limit to how much your hamster wheel can work to spin it in favor of jihadism  sieg heil [ ... ] i guess thats cool in your book as well ? 
   a fascist pig like you so i 'm either a communist or a pro-nazi fascist ? 
  you have to make up your mind , because your slurs are even less intelligent than your comments in general .

  americans are way too paranoid about the government to ever have something like that . 
   ethnic brits . 
  there is literally no such thing as an `` ethnic british '' person . 
  british is a nationality , not an ethnicity . 
  goodnight !, 
   the spanish language is also easy to learn . 
  if you speak another romance language , like romanian . 
   i 've always suspected they 're the worst people in the country , and that 's just about confirmed it . 
  female middle class pensioners are the main audience for the daily mail , which really says everything about that particular demographic . 
  i 'm a labourer , i work more in a single day than nigel has done in his entire life . 
  being a commodities trader in the city is hardly a `` proper job '' , certainly not in the eyes of the `` common , ordinary people '' farage pretends to represent . 
  and neither have you , nigel . 
  that certainly sounds like farage . 
   though i dislike how you have to pick the `` cards '' for each party in such an open area . 
  i had to pick one of each in order to conceal my choice better . 
  my biggest issue with our system . 
  you do n't have to pick your ballot at the voting booth . 
  the major parties usually mail you ballots or hand them out at public party events so you can bring them with you to the booth , you can also write in whatever party you like on the blank ballots and it will be counted as a valid vote . 
  we always vote on sundays too . 
  i 'm certain that weekday voting like in the uk shaves several percent off the turnout . 
  a nightmare served in a bowl . 
  poland big !, 
  and your solution to that is * less * unity ? 
  a more fractured and divided europe still plays right into his interests , nato or no nato . 
  iirc putin spoke positively towards the possibility of russia joining nato when he was first elected president . 
  how the times change , eh ? 
   it is immensely sad lib dems failed to properly force tories to reform fptp and promote the av vote . 
  such a waste . 
  the big mistake they did was settling for av as a compromise instead of insisting on pr . 
  they also should n't have allowed it to go to a referendum . 
  i 'm not arguing against you , just expanding on your point . 
  do n't even need to lock up everyone , just lock up all males aged 12 to 60 and almost all crime will go away in an instant . 
  since the graphic only uses whole numbers anything below 0.5 % would be rounded down to 0 % .

  some are more equal than others , especially the blessed leaders of the communist party . 
  i can not imagine a more finnish activity that does not involve either saunas or knives . 
   in terms of krak\u00f3w main reason is that the city is in a valley cousing the smog to pile up , especially during winter . 
  that 's called inversion and is a common issue many cities suffer from , los angeles is perhaps the most famous example . 
  some german guy did that in the hotel sauna when i was on vacation in denmark once . 
  grow the fuck up . 
  it 's a misspelling , and an illogical and fucking retarded one at that . 
  it makes no fucking sense whatsoever . 
   i could care less you 're not really in a position to lecture others when you make that fucking mistake . 
  none of the above . 
  while we did once drive on the left-hand side of the road , the overwhelming majority of cars here still had the wheel on the left-hand side , which was one of the motivations for the switch . 
  well , the inspiration for them . 
  that 's probably not a very good idea for a bank manager , but for a regular person the benefits of having a long , secure password that 's written down somewhere vastly outweighs the potential downsides . 
  the likelihood of someone breaking into your house to steal your notebook to get your email , steam and netflix passwords is absolutely minuscule . 
  the [ xkcd method ] ( https://xkcd.com/936/ ) is probably better though .

  if wolves , bears , wolverines and lynxes are n't enough already , i doubt adding another predator would make much of a difference . 
  i have never seen more convincing evidence that the end is upon us than a frenchman teaching an englishman english !, 
  the more damning fact is that the opinion of most french people is n't different from the policies of the government . 
  maybe you should try not pushing your own identity down other people 's throats ? 
  iirc the number of welsh-speakers is actually growing already . 
  ironically swedish meat producers use misleading labels to confuse consumers into buying beef instead of horse meat because good horse meat is more expensive than beef .

  [ it is the very foundation of swedish culture , upon which all welfare is built .

  some people are more sensitive to bitterness than others . 
  i 'm going out on a limb here , but it 's the only region of those polled ( notice that corsica is absent ) that has a distinct identity of its own beyond just being french , which probably makes the front national harder to sell . 
  if you 're a person with nationalist tendencies in brittany there 's a good chance that you 're a breton nationalist rather than a french nationalist . 
  yeah , assuming finns drink espresso is a mightily ambitious and almost certainly false assumption . 
  have you ever met an old age pensioner before ? 
  sitting around drinking coffee all day is basically the only thing they do . 
  and the typical coffee-drinking working person will have at least 4 cups per day , one for breakfast , one for the morning fika , one for lunch and then another for the afternoon fika , then some people who really like coffee will have additional cups when they get home . 
  what 's the general population trend in iceland like ? 
  i thought there was a lot of emigration to the other nordic countries ? 
  same here . 
  i 've only successfully finished a cup of coffee once , and that cup contained at least as much milk and sugar as it did coffee . 
  does n't change the fact that most of my countrymen basically live on the stuff though . 
  how many times per day do you drink coffee ? 
  in scandinavia it is common to drink 4-8 large cups every day . 
   i doubt they are attracting many people with their conservatism . 
  your lutheran church is considered conservative ? 
  would be nice if politicians could come up with a pension program that is n't a thinly veiled pyramid scheme . 
   i thought total world population was growing , was n't it ? 
  it is , but the number of children in the world is not growing ( as the late hans rosling phrased it in one of his wonderful presentations , we have reached `` peak child '' ) and fertility rates are dropping globally . 
  most projections estimate global population will peak sometime between 2050 and 2100 . 
  when an issue is as infected as the dispute they have with greece , sure . 
  most of the expensive projects would still be carried out even without the dispute , they 'd just choose different artworks instead of plastering alexander and philip ii everywhere .

  and kills a jew or two, 
  those who wo n't get the help will be labeled as unpatriotic and prosecuted so it 's ok . 
  and you know what 's even more fun ? 
  on russian state tv they 're running around interviewing some individual farmers that were hit by sanctions . 
  description is `` russia sanctions the single biggest sector of expense of the eu '' which is technically true but implies that russia ever was a major customer of those subsidized farmers . 
  so basically , `` mighty russian sanctions are killing europe . '' . 
  i do n't know if i should laugh or not , usually i just rage and turn it off . . 
  well , am i defending the swedes ? 
  because this site is for lunatics from / r/conspiracy and please explain how a ukrainian aircraft with a ceiling of 5k metres will shoot down am aircraft on 11km height * and the missile hitting it in the fucking front * . 
  i bet you would be a bit pissed if uk would deliver warships to nazi germany in 39 . 
  same as the reason they use yandex . 
  it 's russian and was early on im russian and was primarily concentrated on russian speaking people . 
  i think if you live in the old eu countries in a town of 100k + inhabitants , you can get by without a car for daily needs , but for flexibility most people with income still own one . 
  topkek from swedish perspective . 
  i used to live outside of g\u00f6teborg in sweden , but still within reach for g\u00f6teborg 's public transport .

  is there a super upvote button so i can upvote you all glorious motherfuckers submitting links and list ?

  good thing they got the bastard . 
  cyka, 
  if any town in europe as much as can see a russian soldier , i 'd want putin 's head on a platter for public exposure . 
  if we 've learnt anything in the last year about russia is that their official position is worth jack shit . 
   why is everyone constantly violating swedish airspace ? 
  they hate our freedom . 
  do n't you remember how passed carl bildt ( our fm ) about the north stream ? 
  no way he 'd let russia get sweden hooked on the russian drug, 
  how high are you ? 
  where do i get it . 
  so , what does ukraine have to do with all this ? 
  were we bombing iraq or something other that i was not aware of ? 
  do you actually think the sanctions made by russia are made by people who thought of consequences first and acted accordingly ? 
   yet another joke : once in united kingdom , france and russia was signed an order about anal rape of all citizens in every saturday . 
  because of this the citizens of the uk elected new parliament , in france mass protests led to a revolution . 
  in russia people started to queue for anal rape in friday to get home in saturday earlier . 
  but did the british overthrow the parliament * according to constitution * / s, 
  and those who do n't want it get it stuffed down their throats . 
  whatever fluffs your goat . 
  they 're in germany and the eu have n't imposed any food ban , so i suppose business as usual . 
  probably selling mistrals . 
  i do feel sorry for the ordinary russian . 
  both , this year 's produce will drop , next year 's produce will decrease due to expectations . 
  i would say swedish media suffers from `` small pond syndrome '' . 
  everything is so inward focused for a country that is extremely international minded . 
  the feeling is that swedish media writes more about swedish media itself than other stuff . 
  do n't worry , putin strictly said that the food shortage wo n't affect prices . 
  do n't ask me how , but i 'm sure the czar can annex a country or two . 
  it 's history is ( or so i heard ) that when putin evened chechnya with the ground , he basically gave the region buttloads of money to prevent them from rioting again . 
  the mayor of voronezh got jealous and asked putin to bomb voronezh too since he needed more money . 
  since then , the phrase kinda got the meaning as the guys above said . 
  * for the smell of coffee, 
  i agree , we can bash the public faces such as putin , but we should not insult a whole nation . 
  that way we will polarize even the people who factually agree with us . 
  indeed , no one can ignore the us . 
  dude , i do n't know what to beleive anymore . . 
  if you read the news coming out of russia lately , where 66 % think their country is heading in the right direction and if you read commentary of for example [ this ] ( http://ura.ru/content/primenews/07-08-2014/news/1052187045.html ) ( in russian ) article people seem to be for this , and who say stuff like `` i want to eat high quality food , including that made in europe/us '' they get `` gtfo to europe then , we 're fine here . 
  if prices will rise - we will pay '' . 
  soon they 'll start bombing voronezh too !, 
  if you mean sweden ( i 'm ukrainian by birth ) , i think it is widely agreed that sweden was n't invaded mostly for convenience reasons during ww2 ( ie sweden gave passage to german troops when they were winning and sold iron ore to whatever side was winning . 
  but it is of course a bit more delicate than that . 
  dude , i do n't disagree , but your input is n't really constrictive . 
  pretty much everyone was forced to take sides even if they did n't want to . 
  ww2 is a terrible tragedy . 
  mtg is n't really a well respected media institute with respected news agency . 
  mtg is more of entertainment enterprise . 
  i do n't even know if they have any news on their channels . 
  mtg mostly broadcasts shitty american shows like days of our lives and the like . 
  considering that putin was n't even president at the time of georgia conflict it is even more telling how little of a president medvedev really was . 
  what you say is true , but ussr was the one who carried out the dirty work and suffered far more than the us and uk . 
  also ussr inflicted most damage to nazi germany . 
  i know what russia currently is doing is terribly wrong but let 's not paint everything in the colours we like just to pat ourselves on the back . 
  please note , that above info is second hand information , but animal raising depends on environment , food etc. 
  yeah , basically what i understand is that russian meat is chewy compared to australian and brazilian ( and ukrainian for that matter ) so the consumers prefer ( red ? ), 
  that meat over russian . 
  just watched the news from russia 's first channel . 
  putin said that the sanctions wo n't increase food prices , at the same time an `` expert '' told that this will now give free way to improve domestic market because domestic products were not preferred by russians and now will have to buy it . 
  yeah , how this will not increase prices only a phd in putonomics can tell . . 
  people in soviet knew about western stuff , marlboro cigarettes were in high regard and normally only high officials had them . 
  putin himself admitted owning a banned copy of a beatles album etc etc. 
  that last sentence really put a civ5 touch to your comment . 
    why does russia feel the need to interfere in ukraine 's decisions ? 
   well , why does the eu feel that need ? 
  i mean , back then in 2013 when things were relatively calm , it was the eu who told that ukraine must decide between eu and russia and rejected trilateral talks , completely ignoring the fact that russia is major ukraine trading partner and kind of shares a whole lot of other things . 
  that fired up maidan ( many ukrainians thought that they 're going to actually join eu ) and all following events . 
  sweet jesus , swallowing every bit of propaganda , are we ? 
  first , eu said that ukraine could join the eu trade agreement * and * russian trade agreement for all eu cared . 
  it was russia who were stern saying it 's either them or us . 
  nobody thought ukraine would join eu , people were first and foremost tired or putin 's crony who stole billions from the yearly budget . 
  ukrainian people are used to live with corruption , but yanuk 's rule ment * surviving * corruption . 
  people got finally fed up with broken promises and revolted . 
  it was not even about trade deal as much of getting rid of the people in power . 
  it 's not against rules invading your neighbour countries without declaration of war and using soldiers without id marks . 
  that 's ok , it 's just when putin and his cronies ca n't go shopping at harrods it 's unfair . 
  nah , he 'll increase tax on eu made cars to boost glorious cars made in mother russia . 
  was n't he the one laughing at them ? 
  cheers, 
  any direct link to the original article, 
  since russia lost ukraine 's people politically , and they wo n't be looking back in a good while , the only thing putler can do is turn it into a frozen conflict georgia style where ukraine will forever be crippled by `` peacekeepers '' and wo n't be able to focus fully on its internal problems and eurointegration .

i dont have anything against it ideologically . 
  but practically speaking it 's not viable . 
  palestine is far from meeting all requirements to be considered a state . 
  israel pretends they have not already conqured the palestinian terretory so they can avoid giving out citizenship and keep oppressing and slaughtering the population . 
  gaza is basically a ghetto in israel . 
  the one state solution is the only practical solution but the solution which nobody wants . 
  this is a major mistake imo . 
  a `` school shooting '' is popularly associated with one or more students going on a rampage and killing random people before committing suicide . 
  this is `` just your average '' ( sorry for being insensitive ) murder of a single person that happened to take place in school with a gun . 
  there is a huge difference in how specific the motives are . 
  and yes , technically it 's a school shooting . 
  this does not mean that the media should use that term as it 's misleading to the public . 
  no , it does n't . 
  not unless you 're advocating that all phrases have literal meanings . 
  phrases mean what they are generally associated with . 
  a car crashing into a party is not a `` party crasher '' . 
  ie11 did nothing wrong . 
  absolutely agree . 
  recognizing palestine is a meaningless gesture that only fuels the conflict . 
  i doubt most newspapers can guarantee with an accuracy of 0.3 mm of how pictures will be printed . 
  the halftone dots are probably around that size . 
   i wish people did some research on what multiculturalism actually is downvoted for appeal to authority class fallacy . 
  are you telling me legalization wont create structures and market forces that increases the number of people working as prostitutes ? 
  i do n't see that happening . 
  i was talking about sweden , not norway . . and i think pawnstomper was as well . 
  drugs and prostitution is not comparable . 
  selling drugs tend to hurt the buyers . 
  selling prostitution tend to hurt the sellers . 
  your analogy is broken . 
  selling drugs hurts the buyers , selling sex hurts the sellers . 
  saying that the sex sellers do it for `` free will '' is bullshit . 
  people does n't slave for the man because they love to work , they generally do it because market forces make them . 
  it 's also bullshit that there is a static supply and demand of prostitution . 
  if you allow prostitution you allow structures to form in society ( organizations/networks ) that removes friction . 
  a `` legitimate '' market will massively alter peoples behavior so people that would have pursued legitimate careers now become prostitutes instead because there 's more money in it and more demand due to less risk . 
  i have walked there dozens of times and never seen anything like that . 
  an undisciplined armed mob that howls in battle and runs around with fancy wolf tails . 
  i guess they are good for terrorizing the civil population and police but any modern well trained mechanized platoon would destroy these people . 
  you monster !, 
  why ? 
  looks like it was n't even close from tipping over . 
  just give everyone a shovel and force them to dig a canal . 
  boom , 0 % unemployment . 
  the idea that employment has intrinsic value is a dangerous misconception . 
  unemployment does n't really show anything by itself . 
  employing people does not have an intrinsic value . 
  reducing unemployment is not a difficult problem . 
  i saw the account name but poe 's law still applies . 
  i ca n't tell if this is satire or not . 
  fuck people that hate others for being happy . 
  good . 
  sweden is going fucking insane right now . 
  the fucktards at fra ( swedish nsa ) seem to think they are being superheroes and probably masturbates to the idea that they are secret agents with a license to break the law to protect us from the `` evil russia '' . 
  completely insane comparisons is made with the second world war where sweden was breaking nazi codes and this , hacking into civil computer systems and mass surveillance on civil internet traffic . 
  in addition the fra has made outright political statements in the media on how snowden was a bad guy even though he uncovered completely atrocious programs that show among other things that the us indexes information about everyone . 
  indiscriminately . 
  something that would be a massive , massive breach of the swedish constitution ( \u00c5siktsregistrering ) . 
  the police that was recently caught indexing romani caused an outcry . 
  but when fra cooperates with a foreign organization that does this to everyone , nobody even lifts an eyebrow ?!, 
  why ? 
  because the us are some kind of fucking good guys ??? 
  and the politicians are stupid and clueless . 
  politicians in sweden are generally people that ca n't get a real job . 
  edit : also a court in sweden recently decided that fra can basically do anything , including surveillance on the entire swedish people without any checks and balances or insight . 
  the government is now free to fuck us all in the ass . 
  edit2 : in addition fra and politicians supporting it has repeatedly broken promises and shown that they can not be trusted . 
  they promised that the special police ( s\u00c4po ) would not get access to the data . 
  they promised that we would not share raw data with foreign entities . 
  they promised that they did not break into computer systems . 
  all of this has now proven to be false . 
  thanks snowden . 
  i wish i could meet him and shake his hand and tell me that i have nothing but respect for him . 
  this was massively interesting . 
  thanks !, 
  yeah ... sweden has a shit ton of corruption . 
  but it 's not open corruption like `` you have to bribe the police for them to care '' . 
  it 's more like politicians rewarding their friends and family with the companies they are invested in and using public money for private projects . 
  just read a little bit about this project for example : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arlanda_express#history, 
   some place aborts 87.5 % of their babies ? 
  you mean fetuses . 
   nothing is cheaper than getting magic energy built up over millions of years out of the ground and just burning it . 
  i 'm not sure how we solve that problem . 
  you solve that by having high fossil fuel taxes . 
  if you want to change the co2 % in the atmosphere you got ta pay up . 
  great . 
  that this event is a scandal is an understatement . 
  this should not happen in free , democratic countries with western values . 
  yeah , but state and country is the same in the context of this discussion so ebgs comment only made sense if he meant `` staten '' which translates to `` the government '' ( american definition ) and not : `` stat '' which translates to `` state '' as you say . 
   sure , the state is secular . 
  but i would call the country in itself muslim . 
   us is n't a christian country because it does n't employ biblical law . 
  that 's an argument that the government is secular , not an argument that the country is n't christian . 
  i think ebgs comment is a bit confusing because he 's talking swenglish and saying `` state '' when he means `` government '' . 
  we do n't need direct democracy . 
  beatrice ask knows what 's best for us . 
  indeed . 
  also , normal route planning is not np hard . 
  it is solved with dijkstra 's algorithm which has n log n + m complexity where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges . 
  true . 
  and that statement does n't make sense anyway .

  what about every single country * knowing * that it was an imperfect union when they joined up ? 
  this is economics 101 , you can cover it in your first or second semester . 
  i suspect , that they every single country in the euro just ignored the warnings . 
  so , they are all to blame i guess . 
  not just the germans . 
  but i guess it is easier to just put the blame on one guy , the germans , instead of actually looking into cause and effect of what is happening , and realise it is everyones fault really , from the first construction . 
  but sure , if you want to have a simple hollywood narrative , with an evil guy , go for the german . 
  why not , they have been the bad guy for over 70 years , now , why not blame them for the next 30 as well . 
  the problem is this - life is n't a hollywood movie , and thinking it is is actually clouding what is really happening . 
  so have the greeks . 
  they formed the * currency * union together , remember that . 
  they never signed up for transfers , at all . 
  are you claiming they did ? 
  my suggestion is that the current state of affairs in greece is due to the currency union and its imperfections , not the germans , not angela merkel . 
   german required austerity response to the crisis . 
  imf is not german . 
  nor is germany the only country who demands it . 
  and , at least in the beginning , there was a point . 
  i do n't believe even the most nationalistic of greeks support the way the cost/debt/tax system has been run in greece in the last decades , it is long overdue for a reform . 
  but , what is happening now is less of the demand , more the internal devaluation . 
  look at spain for example , they have not have the same requirements , and their unemployment etc is getting worse by the day . 
  what is more important , that it is the only response that is left for the giips , countries , internal devaluation , since they ca n't touch interest/exchange rate . 
  they have to lower the cost . 
  it is not german , it is standard economics . 
  x and y are no longer variables under the giips countries control , so they have to , ( with or without prompting from other countries in the eurozone/imf/eu ) attack the variable they can change - the costs . 
  all to restore competitiveness . 
  it is not germny , it is normall theory of economics , , that unfortunately , is working perfect . 
  so , while austerity is n't working ( and has horrible effects ) it is less the cause of germany ( there are a lot of other countres in the ez as well , btw ) and more due to an imperfect currency union . 
   they will , eventually . 
  i agree  unless the germans admit they were wrong and change things . 
  i think it is wrong to blame it all on the germans , and i 'd like for you to explain why you do ? 
  the main reason is the very imperfect euro , which the germans , as well as the greeks , french , italian , dutch etc choose to ignore . 
  to have a currency union whith such different economies , no financial integration , no banking union , no permanent transfers etc , leads to the collapse we are seeing . 
  however , the imperfect union was well known to everybody , and can not be blamed on the germans . 
  what we are seeing now is the internal devaluation that follows in the wake of the loss of competitiveness that greece and other giips - countries have since the introduction of the euro , 20-30 % . 
  since greece can not move the interest rate , or the exchange rate , they have to press down the costs somehow - which leads us to the situation we see today in greece . 
  however , i fail to see how germany has caused this . 
  could you explain ? 
  austerity is just one of the reasons , the very wrongly constructed currency union is a much bigger one . 
  personally i 'd dissolve the whole thing . 
  yes !, 
  however , if they want to create a currency union in the future - please go ahead , but learn from your mistakes then . 
  it will have to be more like `` united states of europe then '' , with a lot of transfers , financial union etc. 
   the only viable long-term alternative that i know of would be a federal government at the ez currency-issuing level , one capable of sustained deficits like other currency issuing governments . 
  that way ez-wide household deleveraging need never be overly problematic , however i do n't believe it 'll be politically viable . 
  the ez is n't ready for that . 
  true . 
   i think we pretty much agree on both accounts , just stating it out of frustration i guess . 
  the option currently being pursued - austerity til the whole thing breaks - is neither of those two solutions :( . 
  i agree . 
  now i am just wondering for how long it is going to be like this . 
  years ? 
  decades ? 
   that 's why i 'm saying that even if those nations leave , we 're still left with a mighty flawed monetary system . 
  no arguments there . 
  the euro is a deeply imperfect currency union . 
  however , i was thinking how to survive for greece/portugal etc , and i do think it is better for them , as countries , to leave . 
   . . is to run trade surpluse to do that , they have to be competitive . 
  it take decades to become that in a currency union . 
  east germany still is n't on par with west germany , and they have received * trillions * , had the west make sure they did n't have the social collapse we are seeing in the south , and no foreign debt to pay back . 
  yet , 20 years later they still need support . 
  imagine how long it will take for the south , who does n't get that help . 
   the rest , they have to deal with internal devaluation . 
  a process that takes so long that some are saying we 'll pretty much have to wait for relative disinflation to occur instead . 
  that is , wait for german inflation to put german wages at a point where the old wages in greece/spain/etc are once again competitive . 
  to me , that 's hardly a solution at all . 
  i agree , no solution . 
  unfortunately , i think the solution for some countries is to leave the euro . 
  i thought this was a bad joke . 
  brilliant , now they can just decide stuff and we will never , ever have the chance to hold them responsible . 
  what can go wrong ? 
   when your only way to recover from a spending crisis/recession is via trade surpluses with other euro nations the ones with the weakest export sectors will necessarily fold - if there is no such nation , they 'll all fall down . 
  no , it is regaining their competitivness . 
  since joining the euro greece/portugal/spain has lot 20-30 % of their competitivness . 
  the only way to regain it now , is internal devaluation which we can see happening now . 
   this flaw of ez members requiring balanced budgets needs to be corrected regardless of who does/does not leave it . 
  no arguments there . 
  sure , i do not know a sin single country where one part does n't complain about the other , and the transfers , including my own . 
  that still does n't make them a ) different countries b ) give them their own foreign debt c ) dries up the transfers completely and allows the form of social tragedy one can see happening in greece d ) stop them from being in a financial/banking union . 
  and permanent transfers ... . look at east/west germany , 20 years after they entered into a total currency union . 
  they still receive billions every year , and are not as competitive as west germany . 
  and , they had no foreign debt . 
   there is no way out that is compatible with greece staying in the euro . 
  i 've said that since the beginning of the crisis and i still hold this view . 
  i agree , but i hardly believe it is a popular view on r/europe . 
  i get downvoted just for saying the euro is an imperfect currency union . 
  however , that is unimportant , what really makes me sad though is that most of the greeks as you say , are opting for a slow death , with 70 + support for it . 
  i too believe that greece ( and portugal , spain ) have to leave the euro , it is the only way for you to recover . 
  i mean , if one look at east/west germany that also entered into a currency union , although a complete one , east germany is still not as competitive , after 20 years . 
  and they have been receiving trillions , permanent tranfers to support the social system , and had no burdensome foreign debt ( i am not saying greece is on the level ddr was , just that the greek economy and competitiness was different enough from germany/france ) . 
  what do the greeks have to look forward too - 20 more years of what is happening now ? 
  i ca n't even fathom that . 
  i think the sooner you leave the better . 
  try to stay in the eu though , i am sure that can be fixed somehow . 
  you have no idea imperfect the euro is do you ? 
  i 'd hardly say that the usd is a perfect currency union ( does such a thing exists ? ), 
  but a hell of a lot better than then the eurozone . 
  also , unless you have n't noticed , we are not the federal states of europe just yet . 
  just a few things - they have more similar economies ( than the ez ) , a financial union , banking union and huge federal transfers . 
  and , the do not have indivdual foreign debt .

  generalizing and having 0 actual insight on the situation . 
  you think croats never denied the existence of serbs ? 
  at least read what i linked you in my first comment : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-serb_sentiment, 
   i think you 're misunderstanding a lot of the text and need to re-read it . 
  you were de-nationalized as an atheist because religious affiliation was how you determined whether someone was a croat , serb or muslim . 
  i understand 100 % of what he 's saying , but how can the census say that 65,4 % of serbs were religious in that case ? 
  what were the remaining 34,6 % of serbs ? 
  * atheists * . 
  at no point were they `` de-nationalized '' . 
   about albania he 's saying their nationality is not tied to their religion but rather their language . 
  he 's implying religion does not have a big impact on albanians and tries to put it like albanians `` put religious differences behind them '' and even abandoned religion in droves by choice , when really , it was caused by authority in albania cracking down on religion * violently * . 
  he just claimed you were `` de-nationalized '' if you were an atheist , which clearly was n't true . 
  how does that not contradict what he said ? 
  he claims nationalism = church in serbia , but for albanians religion played little to no role , yet albanians during the time of yugoslavia for example , albanians were way more religious . 
  how does that not contradict what he said ? 
  he 's claiming albanians are secular by choice and just language connected them , yet you have two paragraphs at the end detailing to what lengths the albanian government went to crack down on religion , from legal means to straight up killing . 
  how does that not contradict what he said ? 
  there has been * many * times the serbian government acknowledged the incident , [ here 's an example ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/serbia/10017552/serbian-president-in-historic-srebrenica-massacre-apology.html ) of serbia 's president in 2013 * personally * apologizing in a tv interview . 
  please do go on rambling about your love of generalization with all that ignorance on the subject . 
  are you supposed to submit to imperialism then ? 
  i guess you must hate indians and irish people for gaining independence from the british empire / s gavrilo princip did not start ww1 , austro-hungary gave serbia an ultimatum which was basically to surrender its sovereignty or face consequences . 
  austro-hungary wanted war and that 's what they got . 
  any historian will tell you that . 
  as for `` serbian ideology '' , what is that ? 
  pretty interesting to narrow down `` serbian ideology '' to something related to the yugoslav wars which was an 8-year period while serbia has existed for over a thousand years . 
  now for the `` ideology of their neighbours '' , you can start off by reading about the 1,2 million serbs who died in ww1 or the 300 to 500 thousand serbs who died in ww2 and the countless serbs forced to leave their homes . 
  serbs have lived there for hundreds of years . 
  only 50 % of bosnia 's population is bosniak ( aka muslim ) . 
  by that logic , why do 1 million serbs have to be part of bosnia & herzegovina despite 1,2 million serbs dying in ww1 and 300 to 500 thousand serbs dying in ww2 while this country was on the losing side of these wars ? 
  let me guess , you did a google search on yugoslav wars and now you 're a historian ? 
  in ww1 , serbia lost 1 ' 200 ' 000 , equaling 29 % of its total population and 60 % of its male population , the worst percentual losses of any country participating in the war . 
  in ww2 , an estimated 300 ' 000 to 500 ' 000 serbs died , while many others were ethnically cleansed and forcibly converted to catholicism ( according to yad vashem , the biggest holocaust memorial/organization in the world , those numbers are 500 ' 000 and 200 ' 000 respectively ) . 
  i could go on all day , but you 'll have to do some googling yourself . 
  for anyone interested , [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-serb_sentiment ) you can read about anti-serb sentiment . 
  read my response to his comments . 
  please do read my response . 
  i do n't know what your sources are for this crap , but here is a 1964 yugoslav survey :  after the rise of communism , a survey taken in 1964 showed that just over 70 % of the total population of yugoslavia considered themselves to be religious believers . 
  the places of highest religious concentration were that of kosovo with 91 % and bosnia and herzegovina with 83.8 % . 
  the places of lowest religious concentration were slovenia 65.4 % , serbia with 63.7 % and croatia with 63.6 % . 
  you were not `` de-nationalized '' for being an atheist * and * albanians were way more religious than serbs were ... as for albanians being secular , that probably has to do with the following :  albanian communists viewed religion as a societal threat that undermined the cohesiveness of the nation . 
  within this context , religions like islam were denounced as foreign and clergy such as muslim muftis were criticised as being socially backward with the propensity to become agents of other states and undermine albanian interests . 
  the communist regime through policy destroyed the muslim way of life and islamic culture within albania . 
   inspired by pashko vasa 's late 19th century poem for the need to overcome religious differences through albanian unity , hoxha took the stanza `` the faith of the albanians is albanianism '' and implemented it literally as state policy . 
  in 1967 therefore the communist regime declared albania the only non-religious country in the world , banning all forms of religious practice in public . 
  the muslim sunni and bektashi clergy alongside their catholic and orthodox counterparts suffered severe persecution and to prevent a decentralisation of authority in albania , many of their leaders were killed . 
  jumu'ah or communal friday prayers in a mosque that involves a sermon afterwards were banned in albania due to their revolutionary associations that posed a threat to the communist regime . 
  people who still preformed religious practices did so in secret , while others found out were persecuted and personal possession of religious literature such as the quran forbidden . 
  amongst bektashi adherents transmission of knowledge became limited to within few family circles that mainly resided in the countryside . 
  mosques became a target for albanian communists who saw their continued existence as exerting an ideological presence in the minds of people . 
  through the demise of mosques and religion in general within albania , the regime sought to alter and sever the social basis of religion that lay with traditional religious structures amongst the people and replace it with communism . 
  islamic buildings were hence appropriated by the communist state who often turned into them into gathering places , sports halls , warehouses , barns , restaurants , cultural centres and cinemas in an attempt to erase those links between religious buildings and people . 
  in 1967 within the space of seven months the communist regime destroyed 2,169 religious buildings and other monuments . 
  of those were some 530 tekes , turbes and dergah saint shrines that belonged mainly to the bektashi order . 
  while 740 mosques were destroyed , some of which were prominent and architecturally important like the kubelie mosque in kavaj\u00eb , the clock mosque in peqin and the two domed mosques in elbasan dating from the 17th century . 
  of the roughly 1,127 islamic buildings existing in albania prior to the communists coming to power , only 50 mosques remained thereafter with most being in a state of disrepair . 
   serbia had this additional problem where their nation is identified in terms of their church . 
  the church came first , then created the nation . 
  you can still see that today . 
  the level of religious fanaticism in serbia is scary to most other balkan nations nowadays . 
  this is also why i was comparing the atrocities to isis as they had similar circumstances ( nation state created out of centralized religious order ) . 
  the church came first . . ? 
  serbs adopted christianity a few hundred years after proclaiming their state in the balkans . 
  you 're vastly overplaying the role of religion . 
  serbia , just like any country , has had fluctuating levels of religiosity :  after the rise of communism , a survey taken in 1964 showed that just over 70 % of the total population of yugoslavia considered themselves to be religious believers . 
  the places of highest religious concentration were that of kosovo with 91 % and bosnia and herzegovina with 83.8 % . 
  the places of lowest religious concentration were slovenia 65.4 % , serbia with 63.7 % and croatia with 63.6 % . 
  albanians in yugoslavia were way more religious than serbs . 
  poll from 2009 :  in a 2009 gallup poll , 44 % of respondents in serbia answered ` no ' to the question `` is religion an important part of your daily life ? '', 
  now look at what serbia 's neighbors have done toward serbia since * around 1850 * ... what an argument . 
  i ca n't confirm what / u/schaafwond is claiming , but the experiment was n't about pleasing a leader , but observing what an everyday human is capable of when given full control over their subordinates . 
   muslims in kosovo bosnian war tho, 
  outlawing religion does that . 
  lmao, 
  i would rather fight the good fight , even if it meant jeopardizing one 's own safety . 
  sweden was n't completely complacent , there was tons of underground activity and let 's not forget people like raoul wallenberg yadda yadda , but i think fighting and risking experiencing casualties is still better than trying to stay outside it . 
  it was clear that ww2 would completely change the way europe would develop , it was too big of a battle to try to stay out of ... but hindsight is 20/20 . 
  source on the paragraph ? 
  wow , he actually died filming that ? 
  noticed . 
  lol whatever , bye . 
  keep reading bs and believing it without second thought . 
   it does n't have to break british law to deviate . 
  it can be different but within . 
  lol yes as we know laws are incredibly flexible ... some sound reasoning  it proves that atleast some muslims want to impose their religion onto others . 
  congrats , we 've concluded that there are muslims and nationalist extremists like breivik who want to impose their world view on others . 
  now what ? 
  was it worth complicating with 200 comments ? 
  dope, 
   why is it called sharia courts instead of british courts then ? 
   sound logic . 
  please google `` muslim arbitration tribunal '' . 
  it was passed in 2007 and allows sharia courts to those willing to be judged in this manner and it can not break british law ... just please , for once . 
   i assume that your answer is that yes , they did try to impose their religion but that it is irrelevant . 
  yes , they both did in essence the same thing , but what does this prove ? 
  moral of the story : breivik does n't represent all white people , three or four muslims do n't represent all muslims . 
   there is a difference between god being evil and christians being evil . 
  i do n't mind that the christian god is evil . 
  he is not real . 
  christians are real though . 
  `` i do n't mind the muslim god being evil , he 's not real muslims are '' .

  germany had pretty much no say in what happened - their surrender was unconditional . 
   stop blabbing about it like we won lotto you asshole ah , argumentum ad hominem !, 
  again , germany paid reparations to the soviets . 
  15 % of that was paid to the soviets was then to be transfered to poland . 
  that was stalins suggestion and what was decided at the potsdam conference . 
  then we also have this issue of the communist people 's republic of poland announcing that it would unilaterally waive it 's rights to war reparations from east germany on the 23rd of august 1953 . 
  but in the end , the only things that matters here is that earlier this year the german goverment stated that the reparations issue was resolved in 1953 when poland declined receiving any payments from germany and as far as i 've been able to determine , that that included both germanies . 
  now i know there 's talk in poland regarding the legality of the 1953 announcement seeing as it was practically order from moscow . 
  but since you keep insisting that russia had nothing to do with it i do n't think it 'll do me any good to bring that up . 
   yes , i know , silly slavs , should stfu , let wise germanic people rule them and be happy to have good masters / s now who 's spouting bullshit hmm ? 
  quit belittling yourself . 
  quit insinuating that 's what anyone here actually thinks . 
  you 're better than that . 
  poland has plenty to be proud of for what they 've achived in rebuilding both since the war and the end of soviet puppetmastering . 
  that is my honest opinion ; i saw collecton of before/after pictures showing 1980 's poland and modern warzawa here on reddit not too long ago and quite frankly , i think it 's amazing what 's been accomplished . 
  anyhow , i 've enjoyed our little talk , but since you 've started resorting to insults i 'm going to have to bow out here . 
  you go enjoy the rest of your day . 
  i 'm out . 
  i 'm well aware of that , but it was not germany that excluded you and many other nations affected by the war from the peacetalks , that was the allied powers . 
  you 'll have to bring up your complaints with stalin , truman and churchill . 
  the allied powers decided that you should recieve large swathes of german territory and 15 % of the reparations paid to the soviets . 
  are you going to insist on willfully ignoring that bit ? 
  how far back are we going to open the whole war reparation can anyway ? 
  swedish deluge ? 
  crusade of varna ? 
  time of troubles ? 
  mongol invasions ? 
  and lets not forget , germany amonst others - a contributor to the eu has been pouring money into poland for many years . 
  but i suppose that 's not worth anything either . 
  if it 's agreed that dieter pays 300 $ to ivan , ivan is then supposed to give 45 $ of those 300 $ to eliaz but does n't , why is eliaz asking dieter for the money ? 
  of course it 's got something to do with russia , or did the decades of being a soviet puppet state erase all mention of the molotov-ribbentrop pact and the '39 division of poland ? 
  and again ;  stalin proposed and it was accepted that poland was to be excluded from division of german compensation , to be later granted 15 % of compensation given to soviet union . 
   but i forgot , france is not racist hellhole like poland . 
  / s again , your words . 
  not mine . 
  quit insinuating that 's what i think . 
  of course it 's valid . 
  the terms of german war reparations in ww1 where agreed upon at the treaty of versailles to include war reparations to france . 
  the potsdam conference of 1945 did not include war reparations to poland aside from this bit here ;  war reparations to the soviet union from their zone of occupation in germany were agreed . 
  it was also agreed that 10 % of the industrial capacity of the western zones unnecessary for the german peace economy should be transferred to the soviet union within 2 years . 
  stalin proposed and it was accepted that poland was to be excluded from division of german compensation , to be later granted 15 % of compensation given to soviet union . 
  sounds like you should 've recieved 15 % of what the soviets got - from the soviets . 
  so again , why are you arguing about germany while avoiding my question of why you 're not asking the russians for anything ? 
  well then , i guess that settles the matter !, 
  you want money for crimes comitted by a country that no longer exists , crimes comitted before you where born and you want them paid for by a people who only know of said crimes from their historybooks . 
  i suppose you also think that the soviets should pay reparations ? 
  i remember reading about them playing a part in polands non-existance in ' 39 . 
  the living germans from that time are not the ones paying taxes today . 
  the folks responsible for ruining your grandmothers life wo n't be the ones paying war reparations - you 're asking their grandchildren and their great grandchilderen to so do ; folks who had no part in the attrocities of the war . 
  then i 'm going to say no . 
  because muscovy does n't exist anymore . 
  generations have passed . 
  it 's not the same country , but at best a successorstate and everyone involved or resonsible for the actions committed during those times are nothing but dust and bones at this point . 
  yes , that 's the question i was asking you . 
  i 'm asking you . 
  can russia seek reparations for the polish invasion of muscovy in 1605 ? 
  so poland is demanding reparations for crimes commited against it during a time when it did n't exist ? 
  you got a whole bunch of previously german territory after the war ? 
  housing prices are on the rise because people are buying summer homes . 
  it 's a growing problem in mallorca and other places . 
  i assume lisbon is in a similar situation . 
  how is it stupid to hold on to experienced personell ? 
  so some american comes to sweden and raises kids in a wierd way and somehow it 's swedens fault ? 
  s\u00c4po and f\u00f6rsvarsmakten are not to blame for transportstyrelsens miss . 
  would anyone like that ? 
  so , are you saying they should 've built another prison just for him because the ones they 've got are too comfortable ? 
  usually it 's the papers doing it . 
  whenever there 's a newsdraught you get the `` the top 100 earners in your town ! '', 
  headline . 
  it was romania that declared war on the central powers in ww1 . 
  the original picture is of a middle eastern guy and the poster says behead those who insult islam . 
  sounds like a plan too complex for a nation that ca n't even manage it '' s own butter production . 
  hah , jokes on you !, 
  everyone in stockholm already is a rotten egg !, 
  the whole article is complete bullshit anyway . 
  it 's one woman and her blog . 
  there are no investors , no bands lined up , no venue ... no nothing . 
  it 's basically an idea that got some traction in social media . 
  that 's is . 
  how this is even making headlines is baffling . 
  `` sweden plans '' please . 
  it 's just one woman and her blog . 
  we did plenty to help the allies . 
  about as much as the people in charge though we could get away with really . 
  smuggled ball bearings used for british fighter engines , not recognising the norweigean occupational goverment , ruling that norweigean ships in swedish ports not be impounded . 
  training and equipping norweigean militia . 
  one of the truths of the war is that sweden was more reliant on trade with germany than germany was with sweden - especially once the germans had access to the iron deposits in elsass-lothringen . 
  granted , it 's a narrow path to thread staying between the factions and some questionable desicions where made , but without hindsight , i 'd say we did a pretty good job . 
  us joining the war on either side would likely not have made a huge difference seeing how woefully unprepared we where for it in ' 39 . 
  likely it would 've just been a complete disaster for us . 
  skanderbeg was a very good leader with his 6/5/6 stats but his real strength is in 5/5/5 general stats . 
  it 's what helped him hold back the ottomans for 25 years ( and also prevent the fall of constantinople and get me my baslieus achivement ) . 
  fair enough . 
  poor comparisson on my part then . 
  and who exactly is saying there is n't a problem ? 
  there 's a difference between a problem and how big of a problem people are painting it up to be . 
  the millenium bug was a problem , but it was hardly the apocalyptic end to the digital world and modern society like some claimed it would be . 
  from what i remember from the thread in / r/sweden on the subject , this festival has been in the red for two successive years now , so them shutting down hardly comes as a huge suprise . 
  i 'm not a festival goer , so i only skimmed through the thread because honestly , i was more interested in what people had to say about it than the article itself . 
  the only truth in those reports is that there was a shooting and there are 3 injured .

  ( trying to improve our stats ), 
  to be fair though , most of the iranians in sweden are secular and fled iran because of their islamist government . 
  it was the middle-class who left that had the tradition of education . 
  so i guess swedish-iranians are not really representative for all iranians :p, 
  swedish society might be secular in the sense that people do not believe in god , but it 's still christian ( think traditions , holidays etc ) . 
  i mean 70 % of the population are in the church of sweden . 
  bosnians ( muslim ) are surely better integrated in sweden than christians from eritrea . 
  i do n't think it 's about religion . 
  iranians are very well integrated in sweden , a higher percent of their children go to higher education than other swedish-born citizens . 
  so i do n't think it 's about religion but rather who 's better at integrating into the society . 
  yes , i stayed with some friends there . 
  ( they are expats though ... ), 
  yes , of course 60 % youth unemployment rate is real ... but it does not show the `` whole picture '' . 
  i mean many misinterpret unemployment rate and think that 60 % of the youth are unemployed . 
  but as the statistics say , about 20 % about the spanish youth is unemployed . 
  compare that to the 12 % in sweden or united kingdom . 
  of course the situation is bad in spain , but it 's not like it 's all chaos or whatever picture people paint here on reddit . 
  it means that 20 % of the youth ( 15-24 ) in spain are unemployed , which is the same as someone without job who is also looking for job : unemployment ratio = unemployed / total population the unemployment rate just counts those in the labour force . 
  so it does only count those who are in employment or are unemployed , and excludes others who are inactive . 
  unemployment rate = unemployed / labour force euro stat has a picture that [ explains it well ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/8/84/population_employed_unemployed_inactive%2c_2012.png ) . 
  when i was in barcelona a month ago it did n't really feel like people were struggling . 
  maybe it was just because i was in the better parts , and that catalonia is the rich part of spain , but 60 % youth unemployment is kind of bogus . 
  if one includes every youth in the statistics ( and does not exclude those who are `` inactive '' ) then the youth unemployment rate is [ about 20 % ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php?title=file:youth_unemployment_rate_ratio,_2012.png&amp;filetimestamp=20130710115744 ) . 
  this does still count students that are seeking employment as unemployed . 
  it 's from 1810 , and was adopted when they elected him , you can [ read on wikipedia about it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_act_of_succession ) . 
  princess madeleine is fourth in line of succession so it 's not so important . 
  the baby will get swedish citizenship later so it wo n't really affect anything , but it 'll be the first time this happens . 
  but to be in line of succession one must : * have swedish citizenship and be of lutheran faith * spend a part of its upbringing in sweden and have a permanent address in sweden, 
  ** sweden : ** * winter has come to sweden , finally there is some snow here ( in stockholm at least ) . 
  * new reports about the deteriorating rail infrastructure . 
  * princess madeleine will deliver her baby in new york , usa . 
  she lives there since some years ago . 
  * outrage over a statement from a sweden democrat politician that `` rape is deeply ingrained in islamic culture '' . 
  * the social democratic party ( opposition ) wants to cut down on personal in government agencies in order to save money to use for school resources . 
  * the swedish king is going to norway to celebrate their national day . 
  this was cross country skiing though , very athletic , at least at competitive levels . 
  yes , it is rare , but it still tells you something about a person . 
  it 's usually very subtle imho , just listen to some students from djursholm or at handels and you 'll hear it . 
  some people `` fake it '' , while others try to hide it . 
  it 's not so different as i live in stockholm , it 's more about my accent . 
  we do have some slang though , that 's not used in the rest of sweden . 
  it 's mostly that we pronounce some vowels and such a bit different . 
  within stockholm there are many accents and it can give clues about peoples `` social class '' . 
  here 's an explanation from wikipedia :  in the affluent areas of northern stockholm there is a distinct dialect characterized by the pronunciation of the letter `` i '' , with the tongue against the front teeth , so called liding\u00f6 i or viby i ( after viby in n\u00e4rke ) . 
  such areas are liding\u00f6 , danderyd and t\u00e4by . 
  in north-eastern stockholm the `` sj '' sound also has a special pronunciation at the front of the mouth , similar to the one used in kiruna . 
  everywhere i go in sweden people will immediately recognise that i am a stockholmer and therefore hate me . 
  but i will hate on the peasants when they come here and try to integrate into the city life . 
  this is propaganda from companies who just want to lower the salaries of it workers and engineers . 
  i 'm sure they can get competent personal if they are willing to pay the right salaries . 
  in sweden we educate way to many engineers just to keep the salaries down . 
  the doctors ( union ) in sweden have been smart to minimize the number of swedish medicine students in order to keep their salaries high . 
  definitely more active than swedish players at least . 
  then maybe one should make a map of the number of active football players as a percentage of the population in each country instead . 
  if every norwegian game in the first league was full , as in spain , it would still show norway as a larger `` fotboll nation '' in this map . 
  a better metric would count tv views as well . 
  edit : besides you can see for you self that all the `` top countries '' on this map are small countries like iceland , faroe islands , cyprus and montenegro . 
  this is unfair , i mean a standard stadium can only hold up to about 50000 spectators . 
  it 'd be much more difficult for large country like germany , france , spain and italy to have the same percentage as norway or the netherlands for example . 
  right ? 
  why are so many countries worried about inflation , when it 's below 1 % ? 
  it 's really weird , i guess some are afraid of hyper inflation or that they have lost their jobs . 
  this is what happens when foreigners do n't understand that icelanders `` believe '' in elfes as a joke in the same way someone would `` believe '' in santa as a grown up . 
  i think . 
  or icelanders are indeed crazy . 
  btw the [ elf lobby is not real ] ( http://www.thewire.com/global/2013/12/icelands-elf-lobby-isnt-real-according-actual-icelanders/356427/ ) . 
  yeah , i agree . 
  it was quite funny/suprising because we met so many bosnian-swedes there as well who spoke swedish to us ( who were there on vacation as well ) , more than any other country we visited ( which is not so weird really since so many moved here ) . 
  the protest followed events last weekend when around 30 neo-nazis attacked another anti-racism rally in the same suburb , k\u00e4rrtorp , throwing bottles and firecrackers at protesters . 
  two people were stabbed and 26 neo-nazis were detained by police . 
  you can read more [ here in an article ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/22/us-sweden-protests-idusbre9bl08a20131222 ) from reuters . 
  k\u00e4rrtorp has had problems with neo-nazist that go and tag swastikas all over the local school , and puts up lots of posters to neo-nazist websites . 
  so this was a reaction to this . 
  i have travelled through most of southern and western europe + some countries in the balkan . 
  the biggest surprise for me is how alike we are all , and that there are no big differences between us . 
  the only country that had a different feeling though was bosnia or more specifically sarajevo . 
  you could really feel that there had been a war there recently , as you could see the houses had holes from gunshots and also how it lacked proper infrastructure as power cuts occurred regularly . 
  * i make my dinners myself , i eat lunch at restaurants usually . 
  * when i 'm lazy i eat something ready made , but usually it 's just pasta with sauce etc that i make quickly . 
  it is just so boring to cook food for myself so it 's usually something very easy . 
  * well , my parents have a small garden that they cultivate some potatoes in , but it would probably be cheaper to buy it from supermarket . 
  * sometimes i buy organic food , when i feel like it , i do n't really care ... 
  i only buy swedish beef though , because i 'm paranoid of getting mad cow disease , haha . 
  i do n't think it exists in sweden yet . 
  * i 'm a student . 
  * i 'm not sure of costs per month , but i guess it would be something like 1500 sek ( 166 $ ) and on top of that i guess i pay about 1500 sek ( 166 $ ) on eating lunches + beers at bars . 
  together with her boyfriend ( account manager for a telecommunications company ) though , they could probably earn 80k sek which would be $ 106k/year . 
  wow , that comment ... 
  he should apologise , it was not funny at all . 
  yes , and britain has banned porn . 
  the world is crazy . 
  this was a proposal from one politician in one municipality in 2012 . 
  surely no other countries have any crazy politicians . 
  we eat it in sweden ... at least kids puts ketchup on pretty much all their food . 
  i do n't know the answer , but as i 've understood it european startups performs worse compared to us ones and creates less return for the vc companies . 
  which in turn creates less vc capital for that area . 
  so the reason might be how firms can operate in the different markets , for example , europe lack : * a single market . 
  * difficult to exit via ipo 's . 
  * difficult to attract talent to european cities * higher taxes on capital gains in europe . 
  i think vc capital is not exactly a way of measuring of all entrepreneurial activity .

  that 's not how reality works . 
  canada joined world war 2 because you were never at risk of your own nation being destroyed or massive civilian casualties , those things were guarantees if we were to declare war on germany . 
  an ocean and the two strongest navies in the world were n't protecting us during world war 2 . 
  [ remember when russia so valiantly stood against us imperialism in afghanistan ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_security_council_resolution_1386 ) man , those were the days . 
  1st gulf war : a us led coalition that was the largest coalition since world war 2 . 
  supported by the un pretty much unanimously . 
  liberation of a nation that had been invaded by another . 
  somalia : un intervention in a civil war . 
  bosnia : nato and un authorized airstrikes that led to an end of the war in bosnia . 
  haiti : un peacekeeping mission requested by haiti , not entirely a us operation . 
  the us did , however , seemingly do some shady things here . 
  kosovo : simillar to bosnia though without un approval . 
  afghanistan : unanimously supported by the un , carried out by a coalition of nato forces plus a few others . 
  2nd gulf war : yeah , not too much to say about this one . 
  shit decision , should n't have happened . 
  libya : nato airstrikes that the us sort of half-reluctantly joined iirc . 
  primarily carried out by france and the uk . 
  no doubt there 's a lot of money involved in american politics . 
  perhaps even too much . 
  but if you think that the eu that you 're so desperately trying to get into is much different . 
  well , you 're in for a shock , mate . 
  85 000 people are in private prisons in the us . 
  they 're also not trying to join the eu , so what the us does is completely and utterly irrelevant . 
  also , there 's no way in hell obama would 've won if corporate interests got their way . 
  and , ey japan , want your islands back ? 
  i get the feeling that we 'll consider attacking a country that launched nukes to be self defense . 
  most people who commit hate crimes are n't exactly silent about it . 
  i would imagine that the most common evidence for hate crimes is confession . 
  i had no idea they went to london . 
  i figured they 'd do what sinn fein did when ireland was first created , ignore london and work in belfast or dublin instead . 
  my comment was in reference to a son sung in swedish schools when you learn the months and then kinda sticks . 
  that song is to the melody of ode to joy . 
  i can imagine that 's what we 'd be singing , if anything , if that anthem plays . 
  i wonder how this 'll go over once the eu becomes more of a country on its own . 
  will we write a new swedish version of this song that 's actually related to the german one or will it still be the months song ? 
  it has seats for 427 members and there are 650 mps ( well , 645 as 5 mps simply choose not to go to london ) . 
  this is why you 'll see people standing in the doorway whenever there 's an important event in the house . 
  man , that was an absolutely shit play . 
  basically just some dancing and lots of lights and then a dude going `` i am now going to tell you a story independent of what happens down there '' . 
  lousy storytelling , 2/10 . 
  the us has never stages a nazi coup . 
  the word nazi is a very specific term that has pretty much only been done once in human history . 
  yes , the us has overthrown governments and installed more or less horrible ( mostly more , though not even close to the ones russia installed during the cold war ) , but no , never any nazis . 
  so basically you want your kings to be elected through bribery from other governments ? 
  because that 's kinda how the poles elected their king . 
  well yeah , you 'll be hard pressed to find a monarch who was actually good . 
  most of them started wars and killed a bunch of people over nothing . 
  what i meant more was that all of those female monarchs we 've had have been really good at making empires stronger . 
  only if there 's no male heir ? 
  that 's pretty discriminatory of you , dude . 
  i mean , i 'm alright with you yearning for the days of incest , political marriages , and being ruled by people who seriously believed they were made of glass . 
  but advocating for the patriarchy ? 
  that 's where i draw the line , man . 
  why does it have to be a man ? 
  have n't essentially all of the queens of europe been remarkably successful ? 
  isabella in spain , elizabeth 1 and victoria in the uk , catherine in russia , to an extent christina in sweden . 
  i feel like if anything , it 's definitely time we gave the queens of europe a chance to rule us all . 
  you do know that there 's a reason for why we all got rid of our kings and their powers , right ? 
  because they sucked . 
  they really sucked . 
  also , if you believe that there was unity in the old kingdoms of europe . 
  well , you 're lying to yourself . 
  one thing you forgot to mention was the climate change at the time . 
  it used to be rather hot here during the stone and bronze age , much like continental europe . 
  towards the end of the bronze age however it started getting a lot colder and rainier , which probably had a big effect on our culture . 
  i do n't know if you know this , but our parliaments consist of everything from communists to far-right nationalists . 
  so what opinions are being silenced ? 
  i really love the location of our parliament . 
  it 's located on a small island that 's right between old town and the most popular shopping street in the country . 
  the little bridge that leads to the island is a surprisingly good fishing spot , and you can see fishers there from time to time . 
  it 's a very beautiful area all around , i 'd say . 
  you ca n't show off american capitols without showing off the beauty of the [ florida ] ( http://www.flheritage.com/images/facts/capitol_1977.jpg ) one , or the beauty of the area surrounding the [ new york ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/albany.jpg ) capitol . 
  which makes it about half as big as the pentagon . 
  the pentagon 's an absolutely insane building . 
  everyone loves hearing germans speaking english with a german accent . 
  that 's why you 'll see english speakers fake it all the time , and probably part of the reason arnold became as big as he did in acting . 
  detroit 's inner city is fine because that 's where gm and ford have their headquarters and all . 
  if you go just a couple of hundred meters from comerica park though , you 'll see just a lot of abandoned or abandoned looking buildings and empty lots . 
  people keep saying that you ca n't say anything against israel without being labeled as an antisemite , but have you looked around you ? 
  everyone and their fucking aunt is critical of israel these days and there are very few people calling others anti-semites . 
  the law against discrimination states that you ca n't be discriminated against because of gender , gender identity or expression , ethnicity , religion , disability or sexual orientation . 
  so the anti-discrimination law would n't change at all . 
  apparently we could grow grapes here and stuff back in the day . 
  it then got a whole lot colder around the start of the iron age . 
  not a whole lot else though . 
  we were so far beyond the reach of romans and greeks and people from the levant that nothing from our prehistory was really noted . 
  presumably people farmed and fought wars for various lords . 
  social security contributions from employers to employees are set in cba 's , not dictated by the government . 
  eh , it 's a fairly nice feel good story . 
  i can see the appeal of it , even among adults . 
  as well as a chinese abstension . 
  they 're also definitely not going to get the votes of australia , luxembourg , south korea either . 
  chile , nigeria , and jordan voted for the crimea resolution , so they 're probably not going to support this either . 
  in short , russia does n't even have anything close to a majority on this issue . 
  if anyone , * maybe * argentina will support them ? 
  play your video games in the language you 're learning , watch movies in the language you 're learning . 
  during my first year of french in high school , my listening comprehension scores went from average to acing the national listening comprehension test . 
  you probably wo n't feel like you understand things immidiately , but if you just keep listening to someone speaking french , you 'll get it eventually . 
  native english speakers are n't particularly multilingual either .

  the regional catalonian government has full autonomy in everything else except foreign - and defense policy . 
  separatism in catalonia is strong mostly because of populism and the current financial crisis , but since they need spain 's approval to join the eu they wo n't be better off for many years . 
  which is why i believe both parties should agree to the idea of secession before you make unilateral declarations . 
  no one will be a winner when you do it this way . 
   the constitution of spain would not apply to independent catalonia anymore than the constitution of the united states applies to canada . 
  the constitution of the us does not apply to canada because unlike catalonia , canada is a sovereign state . 
  neither could you compare the relationship between a us state and the us constitution , since the us is a full federation , and spain is not . 
  democracy consists of two parts : * people power * , and * constitutionalism * . 
  * people power * means that a vast majority of citizens in some way ( such as elections ) chose their leaders . 
  * constitutionalism * means that those elected must act within the framework provided by a democratic constitution . 
  * constitutionalism * without * people power * describes many semi-democracies of from around 150 years ago : strong checks and balances limiting government , but only men , also often requiring a certain amount of wealth could vote . 
  * people power * without * constitutionalism * is what 's happening in for example russia and venezuela today : their governments got political mandate through people 's votes , but the elected government abuses it 's powers over the legislative and judicial branches to consolidate it 's own position . 
  constitutions exist for a reason , and only once the spanish constitution has been changed to allow separatism can any such referendum be considered legal or democratic . 
  well , abiding by a democratically formulated constitution is something any real democracy does . 
  the referendum is not legal under spanish law , thus the referendum is not democratic . 
  enemies are terrorists , allies are liberators . 
  oh wow , first the planned seizure of san marco by armed men with a home built [ `` bulldozer-tank '' ] ( http://d2.dn-static.se/uploadedimages/2014/4/2/c2c2fc18-8af6-4a81-9bf2-be4bf0810287/original.jpg ) and now this . 
  lega nord should have their own sit-com , where they get into wacky adventures like these !,

  i apparently had a serious brain fart and misstook the finnish flag for an estonian one ... 
  still , i have to point out that kn\u00e4ckebr\u00f6d is delicious and one of the things i always miss when abroad !, 
  ~ ~ did n't know these existed outside the nordic countries . ~ ~, 
  what 's that ? 
  i 'm not sure if you 're speaking an actual language or if you are trying to cough up a small rodent , you war-losing , pig-rearing flatlander !, 
  too busy eating hamburgers , invading third world countries and jerking off to the star spangled banner to learn about geography eh ?!, 
  sverige is the euphoric atheist neutral land where moose and polar bears roam the streets , every girl is a heavenly beautiful blonde and every guy is so effeminate that he 's probably more attractive than your girls . 
  also , sverige has recently become almost 50 % islamic state with sharia laws due to feminist-immigration-politically correct-socialist-lbgt movements . 
  even as i type this , somalis are raping my family , i 'm being force-converted to islam and a whole roma family is trying to steal my keyb, 
  i love how this thread turned into / r/polandball . 
  and cheap , quality beer !, 
  and roskildefestivalen !,

  hah , the sk\u00e5ne `` separatism '' is extremely fringe and mostly a joke because they talk funny and belonged to denmark around 350 years ago ... 
  the northern and eastern part painted in the same red and yellow color ( halland and blekinge ) also used to belong to denmark and i 've * never * heard of separatism from them even as a joke ... 
  how i wished sweden had the same idea about our defense . 
  but the vast majority of swedes think something like '' * eh , we would n't stand a chance against russia anyways , so money spent on our armed forces is money wasted . 
  * '' they simply do n't understand basic geopolitical concepts of how hypothetical hostilities would affect at least the whole nordic region and the baltics , or the idea of deterrence through making aggression too costly for the invader . 
  because the people does not understand this , politicians constantly cut funding from our defense , and in the event of hostilities we 'd need years to adapt from such the low , barely functioning level we have today . 
  unpopular political decision was made , legitimate peaceful protests erupted . 
  these were met with disproportionate violence instead of dialogue , both sides escalated to destruction and deaths . 
  russia uses bribing , bullying , and intimidation to force ukraine to do as it pleases . 
  a few years ago they turned off fuel deliveries in the middle of winter , killing hundreds as punishment against pro-eu government . 
  you 're not inclined to compromise with the puppet of a country that uses the military and annexes your territory . 
  one does not simply march into another sovereign nation 's territory and annex it . 
  it sets a dangerous precedent for justifying invasions of other sovereign nations . 
  well , sources seem more legit and comments less circlejerky/uninformed and moronic than most news or politics related subs i 've found so far . 
  thanks , i just subscribed !, 
  please go away you obvious troll .

  context and translation : the above is a poster for recruiting swedish volonteers to finland during their wars against the soviet union . 
  it translates to * `` the finnish cause is ours !, 
  '' * but as / u/loozerr says , today they 'd be more in a position to help us than vice versa ... 
  oh , the irony . 
  russia sends in troops to protect russians from ukrainian nationalist persecution . 
  who will protect the tatars from nationalist russian persecution ? 
  as a swede who constantly trips over romanian beggars , this really cracked me up !, 
  no , thankfully we have very strong institutions and regulatory mechanisms which limit the power of individual ministers . 
  meaning even if they 're incompetent , it 's hard for them to really fuck things up . 
  things like corruption and abuse of power are rare because of this , high transparency in the political process and a free critically examining media . 
  not to mention people like beatrice ask , who neither has any education * and * has n't even done any `` real work '' . 
  her only merit is being a party member for moderaterna ( centre/liberal party ) for a few decades . 
  and that 's our minister of justice ... 
  yes let 's just start world war iii because that would likely be a quick and easy solution without any negative consequences . 
  try actually reading comments you respond to . 
  free speech ? 
  like only allowing subscribers to vote and banning those who disagree ? 
  and speaking of racism , what would you call moderators using terms like ** [ turk race mixed muppet ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xunomin.png?1 ) ** ? 
  it 's only free speech critique of race mixing !, 
   why is n't `` encouraging mass murder '' illegal it most certainly is , but our hate-crime laws were created to protect minorities . 
  i 'd agree that hate speech laws should apply equally to any group including majority ones . 
  when it comes to defining who is protected under this hate law , the text includes intentionally vague definitions such as '' * ( ... ) or other such group * '' , which * could * include ethnic swedes , but as of yet that has n't been tried in a court of law . 
  what fria tider and / r/european is getting at is probably the myth that the powers that be does not recognize a swedish ethnicity or culture are actively trying to destroy replace us by multiculturalism . 
  furthermore , daesh is not running around freely distributing propaganda , in fact it 's contrary to the point where police visited a girl who recently celebrated her 21 : st birthday and put [ these ballons in her ] ( http://www.metro.se/_internal/gxml!0/r0dc21o2f3vste5s7ezej9x3a10rp3w$pkaoom22cd39yn1n568g2xxnpbx5d5r/isispuff.jpeg ) window . 
  spelling checks out , looks like danish to me . 
  - * admiral , we 're approaching scandinvia , a cold desolate place filled with the descendants of vikings and varangians . 
  should we proceed ? 
  * - * eh ... tell the cartographer to just wing it . 
  / r/european, 
   we have grown from a developing nation to a fully first world one . 
  losing your money hurts , but the truth is that now it 's out turn to pay our share to poland and romania and slovenia and so on . 
  this kind of solidarity is why i love the idea of the eu and why i support the project with all my heart despite all it 's bureaucratic , democratic and other flaws . 
  people like feeling like they are part of something greater , and having an enemy they can call inferior . 
  if not religion , then nation , political identity , culture , ethnicity or whatever . 
  the swedish word for bread , * br\u00f6d * also refers to dark bread , while white bread is called * franska * , which means french . 
  / r/mapporn should appreciate this !, 
  yeah some countries in the region such as morocco algeria and tunisia are pretty stable , but who knows what will happen as daesh 's influence keeps spreading . 
  probably a good idea to take a proactive stance . 
  ironic that someone with a belarus flair says they do n't see any problem ... 
  yeah , state media misinforming citizens with pure falsification of history and outright lies is perfectly valid . 
  saw op : s text and thought i was in / r/european ... 
  if i had to pick one : [ the full 1812 overture finale ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbxgylcnxe8 ) by tchaikovsky . 
  it is about a battle where russia defended against napoleon 's invading grande arm\u00e9e in 1812 . 
  it 's very theatrical storytelling that paints a musical picture of advancing armies and the ebb and flow of battle , it is bittersweet at times and triumphant at the thunderous ending , which features ringing town bells and booming cannon shots . 
  love it !,

  smoking and obesity is a continuous , objectively negative , life choice . 
  it can be changed at any time during the process and can also be reversed . 
  anyone who is fat can lose weight and anyone who smokes can quit . 
  smoking and being fat is a conscious choice you make every day of your life , and a choice that has serious well known health consequences . 
  not to mention that surgery for these people is pretty much useless anyways . 
  i have an obese uncle who smokes , he has gotten 2 heart surgeries and now needs a third . 
  he still refuses to lose weight , despite the fact that all his problems would go away if he did . 
  no , i honestly think this is a good policy . 
  if someone wants to get extremely expensive medical help for a self-inflicted condition , then they need to at least prove that they are doing something to change it . 
  except that no , it 's not . 
  i 'm not saying he is crazy , i am saying that your source is not reliable and provides no concrete proof whatsoever . 
  just more speculations . 
  and it is fine to speculate . 
  that is what everybody is doing right now . 
  but i do take issues with people , of either side , claiming that their speculations are facts . 
  i thought the exact same when redditors were claiming that the coup being orchestrated by erdogan to be an undeniable fact , just because it was a sensible possibility . 
  also , `` every single turk knows about the g\u00fclenists '' is not a credible argument either . 
  it 's easy to find examples of millions of people believing in something without proof or facts . 
  admittedly , i am not well aware of what g\u00fclenists are , but i still wont consider a blog-post a credible source . 
  because if there actually were credible sources , more news outlets and analysts would have picked up on it . 
  first of all , that is a blog from one journalist . 
  i can find similar pages denying the holocaust or blaming the jews for 9/11 etc. 
  secondly , i rarely to never take a site seriously when their headline says something along the line of `` unconventional '' or `` the hidden truth '' etc. 
  one of his sources links to yet another blog post from 4 years ago . 
  --  my best guess is that the coup was planned and organized by gulenists yeah , this is not a source . 
  this is just an opinion piece from a blog . 
  --  gulenists always prefer to operate in the shadows , behind the scenes , and never take direct ownership of operations they launch and control . 
  change that to :  illuminati always prefer to operate in the shadows , behind the scenes , and never take direct ownership of operations they launch and control . 
  and that 's about the same level of credibility that i see in this post . 
  that 's not what your original comment said though , but alright . 
  still , i have yet to see any concrete proof from either side with regards to this whole mess . 
  it could have been organized by g\u00fclen , and it could have been organized by erdogan . 
  or maybe by neither . 
  the only thing i know is that erdogans behavior after the coup have been extremely suspicious and have played out completely in his favor in every way . 
  how does a picture of g\u00fclen shaking hands with the pope , or meeting the israeli rabbi prove that they are somehow members in a sect ? 
  it was a victory for democracy , and a loss for the people . 
   the best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter . 
  unfortunately a lot of people do n't share that opinion, 
  we have imprisoned and fined people for hate speech before . 
  they wont be spreading their hatred from a cell . 
  just like we have to do , make them think about the consequences of their actions before they speak and before they listen . 
  a belief system can be changed over time . 
  remove the extremism and lead it towards moderation and secularism . 
  if the only way you allow , is one of tolerance and intergration then that way is the one it will take . 
  christianity has done it , and so can islam . 
  i agree , we do n't have an obligation . 
  just like we do n't have an obligation to take care of sick and elderly . 
  but we do , because we can and because we wish for a better world . 
  afaik , morocco , iran and egypt all help and take in refugees . 
  sa is a shithole and do n't give a fuck about morals , so it does n't matter what we want them to do as long as they got oil and we are dependent on it . 
  yes , i know a worrying amount of muslims hold `` extremist '' views , which is also why i am saying that we should focus on the areas where these ideas are promoted and fester : mosques . 
  and that is also why i say to hold them to the same morals that we hold for ourselves . 
  it does n't matter if it 's considered `` moderate '' for a muslim to hate gays or jews or whatever . 
  here , it is a hate speech and should be treated as such . 
  shutting down innocent mosques and stopping immigration is not the right way to do it either . 
  however , being strict and enforcing ** which ** immigration we tolerate is the right way . 
  there are millions who want help . 
  we can afford to kick out those who refuse to integrate . 
  do n't allow the formation of ghettos and sub-cultures . 
  crack down hard on radicalization and extremist mosques . 
  require them to learn the language . 
  require them to share our values in regards to homosexuality , equality etc. 
  force them to go to school just like the rest of us . 
  put a zero-tolerance policy in regards to sexual violence and harrassment . 
  anyone caught doing it should be deported . 
  hold them to the same moral and ethical standards that we hold ourselves . 
  there are tens of millions in the world who need help . 
  we can afford to be hard on those who come here and put a lot of requirements for them . 
  unfortunately , this can not be done without also infringing on liberties but simultaneously if they are coming from a war-zone then these requirements are really not that radical . 
  the razing , imo , would be a clear statement of how severely we take these things . 
  more like `` clean up your gathering places if you want to keep them . '', 
  make it clear that if a place breeds extremism , they either clean up their ranks or we remove the place alltogether . 
  which may backfire . 
  i 'm really not qualified to speculate how people would respond to those actions long-term . 
  the main reason is that i want the muslim community to actually step in and throw their own radicals under the bus . 
  far too long they have tolerated these people . 
  if a muslim encounters a radical imam , he should feel the * need * to report him . 
  if not because he disagrees with the imam , but because he gives a fuck about us not razing his mosque . 
  but right now i 'm also quite angry and irrational , so this is not a good time to make big decisions either . 
  enforce hate-speech laws against imams in the same way we enforce it against others . 
  shut down , even raze mosques found to be advocating for death , bigotry or murder of others . 
  make it clear that the target is islamist extremism , not islam . 
  muslims should not feel afraid to practice their religion , but there should be a very clear line drawn when it comes to advocating for the harm of others . 
  a complete ban on extremist islamic mosques would be a good start . 
  start enforcing hate-speech laws strictly against these people . 
  let them know that they are free to practice their faith , however any imam caught promoting death , murder or violence towards others should be arrested and have his mosque shut down and razed . 
  muslims should not feel threatened . 
  they should feel free to practice their religion . 
  however their religion and their beliefs must still bend to our laws . 
  got ta agree with cemkumral . 
  what are they supposed to do ? 
  not report ? 
  steal pictures ? 
  it may be scummy and reminds one of vultures , but at the same time there is really not a better option . 
  yep . 
  and for a good reason . 
  it was a racist as fuck ad , depicting muslim immigrants as gangs of burka-wearing women with babycarriages who take money from old ladies . 
  just as the one in the op is racist , so was that one . 
   imagine a bearded , angry young jihadi shouting angrily at an innocent native white european grandma . 
  ironically , that is very similar in concept to what the sweden democrats first tv advertisement looked like .

  it is n't in sweden . 
  i thought it was only a crime in germany , . 
  well , one argument against it is that it has been tried and failed , in sweden for example . 
  the trade moved . 
  [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_financial_transaction_tax ) . 
  yes , dear god , they wanted to deport her back to muslim country india ( that she was a hindu like most people from india , did n't really face them ) . 
  i am not surprised , i expect we would have had the same reaction here . 
  i 'll guess people will get used to it eventually . 
  i found her pretty , but all miss country have a certain generic look that is a bit boring . 
  it is hard to tell the difference between them really . 
   nuclear ca n't quickly lower the emissions , because the plants ca n't be constructed quickly , nor can the be replaced quickly . 
  sigh . 
  you do n't seem to know anything about denmarks energy history , do you ? 
  they have been saying no since the 60 's . 
  are you saying they have n't had time ? 
  furthermore , it is a lie what you are saying . 
  i mean , yes , it would take a decade , * but it would lower the emissions quicker than they are now * . 
  so , yes , nuclear is better . 
  stop making stuff up !, 
  if you are saying denmark ca n't build and power nuclear power plants in 37 years , * i want proof of that * . 
  source , source source . 
   in addition , there are simply not enough fissiles available to power most electricity use . 
  source . 
  and source that there is none for denmark . 
   nuclear energy is subsidized , among other sources , by the military budgets from world war 2 and the cold war . 
  definately source for that , a danish source . 
  it is bull , that the danes , or for that matter , the us for example who is starting to build new plants , is founding it with left over money from the cold war . 
  while your at it - source for sweden too . 
   perhaps denmark can individually , but there is not enough fissile material for the whole world , and breeders , thorium and fusion do n't work ye so - how is that a reason ? 
  we are discussing denmark . 
  they have the money and the technology . 
  those who can should do it . 
   nuclear and fossil energy have been the darlings of big corp and big govt for decades . 
  despite the big budgets , nuclear still has n't been able to produce a better model yet . 
  it 's '50s technology with a few patches . 
  that is still not a reason to use coal , which is denmarks alternative . 
  coal is 19th century technology . 
  they have nothing else . 
  besides , you have no source for your statement . 
  i want a source for that . 
  a lot of countries , and the people in those countries , does support nuclear , sweden for example . 
  rejecting it because * you * claim , without any facts behind it , that corporations might like it , is the most idiotic reason i 've heard . 
  so , even assuming it is true , why is that a reason ? 
  do you have corporations and people with money so damn much that you automatically reject everything they say ? 
  so , source for your statement , and a reasoning behind why we have to hate things that corporations love . 
   there goes your `` nuclear is cheap ! '', 
  argument . 
  the longer construction times means that your `` nuclear can quickly reduce emissions '' goes out of the window . 
  which i have never ever said . 
  again , lying . 
  stop making up stuff . 
  i said that it a technology that they can afford and have access to . 
  i am also saying that climate change and the deaths denmark is causing every day is far , far worse . 
  do you want me to give you the costs for climate change ? 
  and , you seem not to be aware of the fact that denmark has been using coal and using the `` alternative energy argument '' since the 60 's . 
  what has that cost , not only denmark , but the planet and people in the last 50 years ? 
  compare that to sweden 's clean nuclear . ', 
  i am getting very , very tired that you do not provide sources . 
  i want you to do that now . 
  why are you so afraid of providing sources ? 
  is it because you have none ? 
  why ? 
  i am honestly curious ? 
  are you perhaps a child , in school ? 
  do n't you know what sources and a proper argument is ? 
  do you need help to understand it , or are you genuinly just to ignorant ? 
   source ? 
  do you have access to science articles ? 
  as a student of ( among other things ) environmental issues i have tons of articles , but i do not know if you can access them . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.climatefundsupdate.org/resources/estimated-costs-climate-change ) . 
  [ link ] ( http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/25/the-cost-of-climate-change/?_r=0 ) [ link ] ( http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/economic-aspects/economics-of-nuclear-power/ ) ) see , i provide * sources * . 
  you do not . 
  i guess it is because you do not have any . 
   no miracle , with just a fraction of the budgets . 
  when it finally got some attention , we begain to see improvements almost monthly . 
  the advantage of renewables are that they can be produced and deployed quickly , so they can make full use of all technological progress , and they are affordable for small companies and families , so we do n't rely on government and a couple of big , subsidized corporations . 
  again , source why corporations is bad . 
  and , i mean a scientific source , othewise it is just your leftis ( i assume ) opinon . 
  furthermore , i 'd like for you to explain what denmark has been doing since the 60 's , when they have bee nspewing out coal and destroying the climate and purpose and killing people and calculate the costs of that . 
  third , i want a * reliable source * that it will go quicker and reduce the c02 emissions quicker than nuclear . 
   they have average emissions in the eu . 
  at least they developed new technology that is more useful than the dead end of nuclear . 
  average in a class of idiots . 
  and that `` dead '' nuclear technology makes sweden have almost zero emissions . 
  yet * you * choose to praise coal . 
  you choose to praise people who kill other people , willingly , with their emissions . 
  you praise death and climate change . 
  it is despicable . 
  and again - * f i ask you for a source , provide one ! * . 
  why do n't you ? 
  do n't you have any ? 
  coal vs nuclear is the issue . 
  otherwise , give me another energy source that could have and still can lower the energy emissions just as quick . 
  also , give me a good reason why they have n't been able to implement it for fifty years and still ca n't . 
  science - again , i want you to prove it . 
  please start proving stuff . 
  and the fact that they are lowering their emissions does n't make them heroes . 
  sweden is getting fifty percent from nuclear and have for forty years . 
  explain scientifically why they ca n't do that !, 
  i am getting tired of you not answering that .

  however , , the important thing that happens at the trial is that the judge decides what the penalty will be . 
  we have a famous case in sweden regarding a man ( now known to be mentally ill ) who confessed to several murders and was found guilty ( in a court of law , not through a plea bargain , which is something we do n't make us of ) even though there were no witnesses or technical evidence . 
  my take is that before 1996 and if he was in china , there would n't even be a trial . 
  but as you can see from my linked paragraph he would almost certainly be found guilty after a swift trial anyway . 
  the man was later found not guilty and exonerated in 2013 , and after that there have been a lot of investigations regarding similar cases as to make sure that shit does n't happen or have happened before . 
  he was a violent criminal , though . 
  he is guilty of both robbery and attempted manslaugter . 
  lastly , i just want to say that i do n't have an education in jurisprudence , i 'm merely interested in it . 
  i might very well be wrong in my assumptions . 
  china does n't even have [ presumption of innocence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/presumption_of_innocence ) , which is a key article in the universal declaration of human rights . 
  so my personal investigation says that rule of law in china is fucked up . 
  edit : reading some more , you do n't have the right to an attorney present at your first interrogation , and you do n't have a right to remain silent . 
  that was a major difference , but not really relevant . 
  here 's copenhagen and stockholm ( actually comparable cities ) : http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=sweden&amp;country2=denmark&amp;city1=stockholm&amp;city2=copenhagen&amp;tracking=getdispatchcomparison, 
  true . 
  i notice that denmark is roughly 500 higher than us while we have similar everything ( cost of living and all that ) : s, 
  i thought it was higher ( around 2500 ) . 
  ~ ~ almost all of eastern european countries . ~ ~ ~ ~ 1900 is a low income around here . ~ ~, 
  asians like to give us europeans shit for not respecting and appreciating our elders . 
  well . 
  it 's similar for gay people . 
  they do n't feel safe anymore . 
  we 're figuratively going backwards . 
  makes me sad . 
  and angry . 
  i never said it was n't . 
  crime ! = corruption . 
  yes , it is . 
  it 's hyperbole and fear mongering . 
  and what is that `` so ? '' . 
  i literally do n't have the energy to solve the worlds problems when i ca n't even solve my own . 
  i am convinced that a coup would only make things worse . 
  * substantially * worse . 
  that 's why our current low levels of corruption is relevant . 
  thank you < 3 . 
  i have come to terms with the fact that my life will never be `` perfect '' and full of joy . 
  i do n't work like that . 
  i 've been depressed since i was 12 years old ( 24 currently ) . 
  [ video that tells it how it is for me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xicrnilqgyc ) but that was an inspiring and wise thing of you to say  . 
  i shall contemplate it . 
  have a nice day !, 
  what do you mean ? 
  the story of your times ? 
  i 'm clinically depressed and ca n't even manage my own life . 
  i 'm not equipped to take a stand at this moment in time . 
  i 'm neither ignorant nor naive , but i am ( somewhat ) apathetic . 
  and i do n't agree that i 'm part of the problem . 
  sweden is among the least corrupt nations in the world . 
  we do absolutely * not * need a coup . 
  if , and that 's if , i would vote for pp it would not be a left/right vote . 
  it would strictly be for their stance on integrity and security online . 
  which is getting ever more important . 
  * if * , and that 's if , i would vote for pp it would not be a left/right vote . 
  it would strictly be for their stance on integrity and security online . 
  which is getting ever more important . 
  i do not know . 
  it 's not unlikely . 
  i 'd almost certainly vote for either sd or the pirate party . 
  edit : really , i do n't know how i 'd vote . 
  i have n't put much thought and energy into it yet . 
  i meant it when i said that i actively avoid swedish politics , so i 'm not the most well read about it . 
  nope . 
  yeah . . 
  i actually strongly believe in giving people a second chance , but in this case ? 
  he would just lose his post as ~ ~ chief of police ~ ~ actually not chief of police of stockholm , just a part of stockholm , he would still have a job in the police force . 
  and i wonder , since he did this : what else has he done ? 
  hopefully we can both agree that withholding crucial information like that is gross incompetence/negligence at the very least and should be grounds for resignation . 
  the rest of that comment of mine is just my melodramatic thoughts . 
  what the ** fuck ** . 
  police should be impartial regarding politics . 
  this incompetent tool should resign or be fired . 
  if he does n't lose his post after that statement i guess i 'll lose even more hope in our country and it 's citizens , which i know is a defeatist attitude , but i just do n't have the fight in me . 
  i actively avoid swedish politics because it makes me depressed . 
  i actually believe it will all work out in the end but when that is i do n't know . 
  probably later rather than sooner . 
  not to mention that sweden has a much larger economy and an advanced and healthy arms industry . 
  we could supply finland with plenty of high tech arms at subsidized prices or for free in the event of war . 
  edit : and like 4000 [ bandvagn 206 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bandvagn_206 ) which would probably be lent for free . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duty_to_rescue also :  in the united states , as of 2009 ten states had laws on the books requiring that people at least notify law enforcement of and/or seek aid for strangers in peril under certain conditions : california , [ 10 ] [ 11 ] florida , [ 10 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] hawaii , [ 10 ] [ 14 ] massachusetts , [ 10 ] [ 15 ] minnesota , [ 10 ] [ 16 ] ohio , [ 10 ] [ 17 ] rhode island , [ 10 ] [ 18 ] vermont , [ 10 ] [ 19 ] washington , [ 10 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] and wisconsin . 
  [ 10 ] [ 22 ] so there 's like a 20 % ? 
  chance you live where you could be held liable for inaction . 
  but he probably meant morally . 
  related is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/good_samaritan_law, 
  political correctness is a cancer no matter what your political views may be . 
  it has reached very dangerous levels in sweden and germany . 
  it has to stop . 
  one thing i take from this is that `` that '' is literally `` dat '' in dutch . 
  i think it 's pretty well established that the red star is a symbol of communism . 
  that was hardly a red star , even . 
  it had a red edge . 
  and the swastika can be used for other things than nazi germany , but today it means nazi germany in 99 % of cases . 
  you 're welcome . 
  it 's * pique * , my friend . 
  wow , they even have a red star on their flag/emblem . 
  props for honesty , i guess ? 
  iirc it says it weighs as much as 40 buffalo . 
  sweden as well . 
  edit : on christmas eve , actually . 
  fuck him and fuck banning shit on campuses . 
  there have been 27 wars fought between denmark and sweden .

  yeah , it 's an open secret that 99 % of journalists have no sense for mathematics . 
  they can look at a screen like that and not notice that it ca n't possibly be right . 
  1/3 of the german population was killed in the 30 years war . 
  * directly after that * , similar mercenary armies reduced the population of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth to the same extent . 
  scania tried to rebel too , remember ? 
  and some people in j\u00e4mtland want to be independent . 
  the support for secession and ultimately joining russia is not very strong . 
  much of the initial support the separatists got from the locals were due to a ) confusion about goals ( more independence within ukraine , federalism ) and b ) russian propaganda making people afraid of the interim government . 
  now it is clear that the provinces held by the separatists want to make a repeat of what happened in crimea , only with more military force and less popular support . 
  and the fighters are russian soldiers of fortune/fugitives/volunteers to a large extent . 
  in the short run , laying down arms will spare lives , but it will also destabilize the kiev government with unpredictable results . 
  so what do you think is a reasonable response to an armed rebellion ? 
  the question is if they can keep it up . 
  the rebels can only last if they have support by a foreign actor , which would have to be russia . 
  you realize that this is already the case with american technology , no ? 
  if you call modern day sweden `` nowhere '' , i 'm pretty happy about nowhere . 
   janne josefsson who is the reporter here got called a nazi for this in one tweet by a semi-obscure radio personality . 
  i 'd say that there was a controversy , but that the show got plenty of public support too . 
  not openly racist . 
  nah , they are n't necessarily spoiled by having a lot of things , just by getting by without working . 
  yeah , very disappointed that pp did n't make it . 
  my vote was n't enough :(, 
  if you do n't care , you 're not really contributing . 
  ideally , every mp has a few issues they want to work hard on on the european level . 
  what do the slovaks want in the eu ? 
  i do n't know , and it seems you do n't know either . 
  the swedish pirate party got one ( then two ) delegates 2009 and got to sit in the internet policy committees , where they wanted to be . 
  one of the green candidates worked hard on reforming fishing policies and got quite far . 
  the main problem seems to be that latvian candidates have n't found a cause to fight for . 
  the swedish candidates even say that apart from snus and the alcohol monopoly , the swedish candidates * do not form a block * , but work within their european blocks . 
  swedish members of the european parliament do n't complain about a lack of influence . 
  they all say that `` you choose an issue that is close to your heart , fight for it and make a difference '' , and that `` it 's actually quite possible , even for a single mp , to have influence in brussels '' . 
  unfortunately , i think it 's because the citizens in the east are not informed about what exactly the common european issues are , and that the course is on things outside finance/ecb/transfers are set by people who fight for what they believe in . 
  if you see the eu as a money-grinding behemoth , that can give your country some nice subsidies , as negotiated by your national government , and no common european issues , you would probably not care about voting . 
  pirate party vote here too !, 
  second option was the greens , the main candidates have done a lot to move the eu towards sustainable fishing . 
  yes , as a * first * language . 
  again , these maps are all about * second * languages . 
  two similar languages that develop in parallel have tendency to create new words that are very alike phonetically , but may mean totally different things . 
  `` false friends '' . 
  catchphrases have the same problem . 
  a lot of subtext is to be conveyed in a few words , so just making one of the words different , even if still intelligible in writing , will make people go `` huh ? '', 
  instead of `` oh , yeah ! '' . 
  in conversation , you 're more focused on understanding the other person and you are taking personal expressions into account . 
  in this situation , it 's much simpler to bridge the language gap , because when norwegian and swedish use different words , you can figure out the meaning by knowing your own language well ( contemporary/archaic , common/rare expressions ) half of the time , and the rest of the time you can usually understand from the context . 
  the lesson we can take home from all this is that official messages and advertisement need to be idiomatically correct ( `` spot on '' ) , while a spoken sentence in a conversation only needs to get a few key facts across . 
  you 'd assume many germans ( with germans as a first language ) would want to learn turkish ? 
  does n't seem to be the case . 
  in practice , i guess second-generation german turks would be better at german than turkish , but still count turkish as their first language , since it 's what they and their parents speak at home . 
  first languages were * not represented at all * in these maps . 
  it 's a common * first * language in several places , but a rare second language . 
  a person with turkish as a second language while living in the eu would most often be a kurd . 
  we do n't understand nynorsk , otherwise we 're usually fine with norwegian . 
  ok , bergen dialect can be harder too . 
  perhaps after some time of exposure , but from what i heard danes and finns are the most likely to talk english to each other , including the finns who speak swedish as their first language . 
  understanding prosody is a matter of exposure , mostly . 
  for a swede , it 's often harder to understand the copenhagen dialect than other dialects . 
  the urban dialect has been the motor in creating modern danish , with it 's tendency to swallow consonants turn them into diphthongs . 
  thanks for making me laugh . 
  just pointing out that this is becoming a real thing . 
  why do * you * need an identity ? 
  do you even know that your chromosomes does not always decide your biological sex , and that newborns with ambiguous genitals usually go through surgery to make a vagina ? 
  why would they have to identify as female ? 
  because a doctor cut them that way ? 
  even many official forms now have the option man/woman / * other * . 
  so i take it you identify as `` other '' ? 
  it 's fairly accurate for sweden , but i would n't trust this to give a good picture at all . 
  that 's why i wrote that self-employment can mean anything and you 'd have to list profit/salary to understand if it 's just unemployment with a different name !, 
  if you register as working full time as self-employed , you 're not unemployed , even if your company has 0 customers , zero income and no investment . 
  you do n't have to be able to pay yourself a salary . 
  all that is required is that you have registered a company and that you fill in that you work full time with your company . 
  if you have the job to help an unemployed find gainful work ( there are many in this profession in sweden ) , it 's much easier to help them register a company and fill in a tickbox , than actually matching them with a job . 
  this also temporarily protects the ego of the unemployed , not `` forcing them '' to take a job below their dignity . 
  this is my point , pushing low-potential , unskilled unemployed to self-employment is mostly a way to tidy up the statistics . 
  then again , we do have some excellent support for startups ( free desks at shared offices , some financial support , etc ) and sweden can boast with many mobile app successes , just to pick one field with many startups . 
  exactly . 
  now , imagine that you had no skills , or even means to acquire skills , being a functional illiterate ? 
  that 's why i wrote that even with * no skills , no capital , and no contacts * , 10 % still make it . 
  i 'm quite sure you had some skills and contacts , though . 
  or am i wrong ? 
  i think the best us analogy would be the movement in the 00 's to own your home . 
  buying a home was marketed with `` you do n't need a stable income !, 
  you do n't need to pay mortgage or interest for , like , * forever * !, 
  just sign in here and move in today ! '' . 
  self-employment has been pushed on those with low drive , barely any skill and no business connections . 
  how do you think that will work out , on average ? 
   in the us ( i live/work in the us tech industry ) it 's similar except the whole `` starting a business '' mentality actually works fairly often so it 's less of a cop out for the government and a genuinely good thing for the economy . 
   a lot of techies who lost their jobs a few year a ago went on to start small companies and while they originally had to live on savings , they now make more than they ever did when steadily employed . 
   then again i guess capital is a lot easier to acquire here and the potential consumer base is massive so maybe comparisons are n't valid . 
  this is n't like that at all !, 
  we have many successful startups in the tech industry . 
  i 'm talking about abdullah , the illiterate refugee from somalia , sara that has been on disability that last four years and has few marketable skills beyond `` microsoft word '' , or mikael , who 's got `` computer skills '' that consists of beating twenty ps3 games in the living room of his mothers apartment . 
  in this context , i 'm exclusively talking about those who have very little skill and no contacts . 
  precisely those who 'd have the most to gain from an employer and * acquiring * marketable skills are those who are pushed out into `` self-employment '' . 
   if you do n't want to be self-employed , go and work for someone else ? 
  today , the situation is reversed , at least it is in sweden : `` if you * ca n't * find employment , start a company !, 
  we 're sure you 'll be successful . 
  bootstrap yourself to success ! '' . 
  unemployed are actively encouraged to start their own company , and while they struggle to make any kind of money , they count as gainfully employed . 
  starting a company -- without a powerful concept , guaranteed or likely customer base , a fair amount of starting capital ( more than what a poor , unemployed person can put in ) , as well as a number of useful contacts -- will result in a failure 90 % of the time .

the people will oust the government in favor of a pro-eu one , but before you know it unmarked norwegian troops will land and stage an anti-eu secession rebellion in the eastern parts of iceland .

  jerusalem and it 's surrounding holy sites was to be governed by the un and be of equal access to both sides . 
   a bunch of racist fundamentalist europeans with absolutely zero legitimate claim [ * straaaaawman , fighter of the nightman ... * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzavd6zl2ba ), 
  why would they ? 
  what is the similarity here ? 
  germany was punished after the second world war and lost historically german territories in the east to poland , partly as a war reparation . 
  the arab palestinians attacked the jews and tried to seize all of palestine , but lost the war and had territory taken from them instead . 
  ireland was completely annexed by great britain in a practically colonial manner for imperial reasons . 
  the simile here would be if the uk had lost their aggressive war with ireland and in turn lost territory to them , and would now be desiring it back . 
  were n't they mostly muslims though ? 
  the only alternative i can think of is palestinian arabs , but there were and are arab jews too . 
  anyhow , yes 56 % of the land was allocated to the jews since they were expecting a massive amount of immigration in the short and medium term , but a big chunk of that land consisted of the very non-arable negev desert . 
  yeah , but the irony is that the palestinian muslims chose to persecute the jews in order to keep palestine for themselves , which is what people are blaming israel for doing onto the palestinians nowadays . 
   developed nations that caused this mess to begin with what about in 1948 when the palestinian muslims refused to divide the country into two equal parts for each religion , as was mandated by the un ? 
  it was supposed to be a solution for the antisemitism and religious tensions in the country , but was met with refusal and the muslims declaring a civil war on the jews with the intention of kicking them out . 
  after winning , israel simply decided that they would be taking more than just 50 % of the country ( and if you think that 's wrong and should be undone , you should feel the same thing about historically german territory becoming polish in 1945 ) . 
  denmark is renowned by it 's forest clad mountain ranges ( ever seen beowulf from 2007 ? ) .

  lol you even say it yourself that the rest of the navy was a collection of floating junkers . 
  many of the soviet tanks , planes , guns and even atomic bombs generally showed lower accuracy and lower reliability than the weapons designed by nato , and previously the allies and the axis . 
  the soviet union had the benefit of having a larger army and air force than the others , and therefore partly accepted cheaper equipment . 
  this goes back to the 18th century , when russian troops were predominately levied serfs and were thus employed en masse against enemy armies . 
  how the hell would it be racist to make a generalization based on this ?

  there are plenty of planned and surprise inspections from government bureaus to plants of all kinds , especially if they process food items , pharmaceuticals or other things involving pathogens . 
  there 's always one employee who is personally responsible for constantly maintaining a safe and sterile environment and process line , which goes from before they receive their resources to the moment it 's shipped . 
  i can promise you that asses were kicked and stiff government bureaucrats were all over this , and the company has definitely reworked their protocol to prevent this in the future . 
  if they have n't , they 're pretty much being illegal . 
  and most cases it is n't the company itself acting evil , but just some employee who accidentally or out of laziness disregard the proper protocol . 
  i 'm sure someone and their supervisor was punished for this internally . 
  the codex justinianus was a codification of earlier roman laws .

  by the time of the great schism it started heading in another direction than that of western europe . 
  the roman republic is the appropriate cradle of western civilization !, 
  it 's a natural reaction to discussing immigration in sweden . 
  sure , sweden is receiving more immigrants per capita than the us has at any point over the last couple of centuries , and its in general 10 times more per capita than other scandinavian countries , but if you propose that these numbers might be troublesome you 're a racist . 
  you do n't actually think about things like employment issues , integration , the housing market , but instead , you 're actually just a racist . 
  you just want racial purity and round up and shoot non-aryan people , do n't you ? 
  [ 90 % of the population increase since 2000 has been by immigration ] ( http://www.dn.se/ledare/signerat/det-nya-sverige/ ) , among whom the employment rate lies at 58 % ( it 's 82 % for people born in sweden ) but it 's still taboo to discuss it .

  sorry , a bit badly worded as that is often used in the context of gender equality .

  thanks ... 
   other than that you said that you think that the army is probably enough . 
  and that was n't good enough so you 're calling me a moron . 
   so probably quick to finish if ye want does sweden have any nuclear power plants ? 
  three . 
  about 50 % of our electricity is produced there . 
  apparently the government is supposed to have got rid of it completely , but i guess you never know . 
  doubt there 's much left though . 
   my comment is phrased very poorly but i 'm actually curious has the idea come up in general debate in sweden . 
  we had a [ nuclear weapons program ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_nuclear_weapons_program ) . 
  the reason not to restart it is because it would kill our economy if anyone found out and started embargoing and stuff . 
  among other things . 
  most importantly probably that we ( the people ) do n't want any more nuclear weapons in the world . 
  why the fucking fuck should i need to answer all those question not to be called a moron when you barely even asked a single coherent question in your original comment :  yes , it should be voluntary out of principle , just like following laws , rules , paying taxes and all that . 
  right ? 
  why should i have to do anything for the state ? 
  i still stand by my original answer to that as pretty reasonable :  i 'm of the opinion that the state should force things on people as little as possible . 
  paying taxes , going to school , and so on is necessary . 
  serving in the military is not something you need to force people to do . 
  having a professional military should work well enough . 
  can you read that again , please . 
  because i really really do n't see why that is an unacceptable answer . 
  i did n't go into all the details of * why * conscription is unnecessary , because that is a very big question and you did n't explicitly ask me to explain why i thought that . 
  and i still do n't feel like explaining that because it 's a lot of work , the only reason i 'm still arguing with you is because you keep calling me a moron , and i find some personal offence in that . 
   some person claimed that conscription should n't exist because the state should n't force things , in his opinion . 
  that was me . 
   i asked if his opinion was the same about taxes . 
  i said no , and explained the difference in very simplified terms , also provided an example in the form of mandatory church attendance in what i consider unnecessary , much in the same way as conscription . 
   exactly , none of us can predict the future , so is n't it a good idea to get insurance instead of do n't and hoping for the best ? 
  i 'm guessing you do n't believe in fire alarms , why would you get one if your house is n't on fire ? 
  and you ca n't see into future , according to you , in that situation we should do nothing about it and hope for the best - aka - not get insurance . 
  but my point is that we should always be prepared - aka - get insurance , alarms and all that . 
  i agree that we should always be prepared . 
  but i disagree that this specific insurance is the best way to go . 
  i think this other insurance achieves the same result , maybe even better , and also has better ethical practices , such as not forcing their workers to work there against their will . 
   i called you a moron because you were unable to provide one single argument as to why the state should force one thing but not the other my argument was that i do n't think it 's necessary , that our military would function well enough without conscription . 
   you were completely unable to in any way give an answer as to why there is a difference , that 's why you 're a moron . 
  if we are going to go there , you have in no way given any answer to why we * should * force people to do these things , other than that you think it 's necessary , which is exactly the same as my argument . 
  i was also not trying to convince you , just telling you my point of view . 
  and in that case , my original comment about conscription being wrong out of principle was good enough . 
   i not only could but did provide arguments . 
  you 're not a moron for not agreeing , you 're a moron for not being able to use language to tell me why . 
  this have nothing to do with the point , this is just you not being able to form basic sentences . 
  i think it 's also about you not being able to read basic sentences . 
   no it was n't . 
   my argument was a counterargument , somebody said it should be voluntary out of principle . 
  i asked if he felt the same about taxes . 
  so yes , it is ? 
   how can you predict the future ? 
  how can you safely say it 's never ever going to be important ? 
  i ca n't , neither can you . 
  that is what i believe . 
  you believe contrary to that , that 's fine , i do n't think i convince you otherwise so i 'm not going to try . 
   what am i supposed to do with that ? 
  understand that that is my opinion . 
   what did that prove ? 
  i 'm not trying to prove anything . 
   other than the fact than to show you believe in taxes but not the army ? 
  that 's my entire point , but you call me a moron for thinking something you like is n't necessary . 
  yet your entire point is that something i do n't like is necessary . 
  that is the irony . 
   we do n't force people to go to church any more . 
  why should we force people to go to school ? 
  your entire argument was that we already force people to do some stuff so why not this too . 
  which is why i brought up the comparison , i obviously do n't think that is a good enough reason . 
  so ok , you believe it is necessary for sweden ? 
  i do n't , as is pretty exemplified by the fact that the military is already saying that they wo n't force people , which is why i think it 's important that we change the laws too , not just the practice . 
   you claim the things you like is necessary , but the things you do n't like is n't . 
  do n't you understand how much of a moron you sound like ? 
  do you realise the irony in this ? 
  i 'm of the opinion that the state should force things on people as little as possible . 
  paying taxes , going to school , and so on is necessary . 
  serving in the military is not something you need to force people to do . 
  having a professional military should work well enough . 
  we do n't force people to go to church any more . 
  should we start that up again ? 
   are they afraid it would be perceived as an aggressive move by russia ? 
  we do n't trust continental europe to handle important things like military in a way we like . 
  we are also together with the uk the most anti-eu countries , we almost always dislike any widening of the eus powers . 
  it 's probably because we believe we can do as good or better ourselves , why give power to the eu then ? 
  while it might be the other way around in some other very pro-eu countries , where the eu is a seen as more responsible than the local government . 
  in sweden 's case we are also supposed to be neutral , which has worked well for us for a couple of centuries , we do n't give that up lightly . 
   the only option that leaves us is to cooperate with other nations around us that share similar interests militaristically , economically , and politically . 
  this would obviously be the eu . 
  what about us ? 
  :( i do n't know about you finns , but to me a nordic defence union seems like a much better idea than an eu one .

  it 's just a plain bad analogy . 
   the point is that the inability to devalue is one of its important features , not some side-effect . 
  important features ? 
  not being able to devalue a currency is bad . 
  in a recession you 'll have a tougher time getting up for instance . 
  the inability to devalue the currency was a reason why it was faught against . 
  why do you think other countries have n't got a similar eurozone ? 
  because in reality it 's bad . 
  look at how gb opted out for instance , same with sweden . 
  norway does n't even wan na get into eu because then it would be just giving away billions per year and get in return bad laws which says they ca n't do snuff anymore . 
  it 's ridiculously bad for carrying countries . 
  the only reason why germany accepts the deal is because they actually profit off greece/italy/spains debts more than they lose . 
   the point of the euro is , however , to create an economic bloc strong enough to be a backbone for a european presence in an increasingly multi-polar world . 
  this wo n't be effective unless every country shares the same policies . 
   thus , one could perhaps argue that the fault was not to have the right stick or other carrots or whatever next to the euro-carrot . 
  the latter is still not at fault , the problem is the missing means to handle asymmetric shocks . 
  it would be more constructive to argue for fixing this mistake . 
  i do n't see your point here . 
  euro is like a big bloc here . 
  saying you want to tear the bloc appart and still keep it intact is silly . 
  besides we can still handle asymmetric shock by having own currencies . 
   saying the euro is at fault for the crisis because it ca n't be devalued is like saying cars are responsible for accidents because they are so fast . 
  not a good analogy because euro is n't responsible for the crash , it 's responsible for not being able to fix it as smoothly as other currencies . 
  crashes are difficult to predict and it 's always easy to be smart in hindsight . 
  therefore a better option is to have a system so you can easily repair the damages . 
   the fixed value across the eurozone is the feature that allows cross-country supply chains to be created , just like the speed of the car makes it a great means of transport . 
  still not a good analogy . 
   the blame lies with the national governments that did n't adapt their policies to the changing circumstances , be it by being responsible in their own nations or by giving the eu the proper authority to regulate the eurozone to counter such crises . 
  governments and banks are selfish . 
  you ca n't give them a carrot and then be surprised they take it . 
  obviously in a democracy the will of the people usually goes , and in the case of greece , the will of the people was to ignore the debt . 
  still , the problem was that greece could not repair its debt , which they could 've if they had their own currency . 
  to be realistic the eurozone is a bad idea because there will always be carriers . 
  in the end germany for instance do n't want to spend billions trying to stabilize greece because they are too lazy to do it themselves . 
  in simple terms , if they had drachma , the crisis would n't be as big as it is today because then greece would go under themselves and then they have to fix it themselves . 
   i fail to see the argument that explains why the euro is at fault . 
  you ca n't devalue it . 
  eurozone made an exception for greece because they thought greece would straighten themselves and work for their membership but the opposite happend . 
  if greece still had drachma they could just devalue it and voala , problem solved . 
  you basically chain yourself together with a common currency like the euro , however spaning the euro too far often leads to implications because of culture and so on . 
   these countries knew they did n't have the ability to devalue any more . 
  greece counts on other countries to help them out , but they basically do nothing themselves . 
  they had the opportunity to make life a little easier by just owning one house etc but they opted out , and thus comes the consequences . 
   if they continued policies that would lead to them having to devalue at some , it is their fault . 
  it is greece 's fault because they 're in debt with a tough return yes . 
   the boundary conditions imposed by the common currency did n't sneak up on anyone and were not a bug but a feature . 
  people assumed greece would take responsibility for their mistakes but no . 
  as i said earlier greece was an exception for the eurozone . 
  a bad one at that which really makes you question the economic brainiacs making the decision . 
  it 's easy to be smart in hindsight . 
  obviously a simple mistake people make is that people are willing to lose money to greece . 
  the thing is , more money is to be made by giving greece bad conditions for loaning . 
  furthermore it 's greeces fault they made bad investments . 
  most greeks had several real estates and they retired earlier than most other countries . 
  also / u/bowgentle is responding to the irish crisis , which is n't as big as the greek . 
  irish crisis is about the real estate bubble and how banks take advantage of it . 
  in the irish crisis the banks are at fault for being greedy , in the greek crisis , the governement is at fault . 
  in any case , having your own currency allows you to devalue it , unlike a common currency like euro . 
  this means in practice that you can sell resources at a lower cost and therefore export more . 
  there is a reason why we have three different kinds of kronor in scandinavia . 
  so in summary , yes the euro is at fault for not being able to deal with the problem . 
  the people are at fault for creating the problem . 
  think of it as chaining yourselves together . 
  if one falls off the cliff , you 're all doomed . 
  i think none who understands economics would want euro now , well ... except the countries falling off the cliff . 
   the euro why ... ?

  it 's free , dental care is n't . 
  it 's the same thing with [ these ] ( http://www.sydsvenskan.se/images2/2013/2/10/00252872.jpg ) over here in sweden . 
  people automatically assume it 's racist because usa had some problems , but sweden = / = usa and two different cultures develop different things and meanings . 
  because they do n't know what 's best for themselvs and any choice to go back to their litterally hell former country must be brainwashing or fear from nazis . 
  no , my point is if slovaks and czechs were so similiar , it would be weird if czechoslovaks split from one another . 
  slovakia and the czech republic are different enough to be split . 
  imagine how it is for countries where there are 2 big cultures ? 
  everyone has cultural minorities , and they 're called cultural minorities because they are very small . 
  those does n't really count . 
  sweden has a cultural minority of arabs , but we do n't consider it swedish to be halal and pray . 
  to the most parts it is . 
  a lot of european countries are . 
  why do you think the czech and slovakia split ? 
  mono = one . 
  he 's saying that the czech republic is a single culture country . 
   what was you statement ? 
  that muslims burn down churches ? 
  that was n't my statement , [ but since we 're at it . 
  ] ( http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2015/april/muslims-burn-69-churches-christians-forgive/ )  people are very religious and there is pressure in society to show it . 
  even the extreme sides of christianity are dull compared to islamic sides . 
  there are no states which are built on christanity that still conserves the values and are letter interpreted . 
  there 's a massive difference in the bible , torah and qu ` ran . 
  the qu ` ran is litterally the last word of god , whatever it says goes , unlike torah and the bible . 
  the abrahamic religions are also the most violent religions there are . 
  other religions usually focus on way of life of individuals and thus do n't include things like killings or stupid pushments . 
  i lie ? 
  in what way is your statement even remotely factually based ? 
  you 're trying to discredit me by saying that i have no experience with these issues and then when i claim i do you just call it a lie without knowing anything . 
  all around stupidity from your side , it 's hilarious but at the same time alarming . 
  so your comment is irrelevant to my statement , am i right ?

  welsh people get screwed over and called english again , and northern irish are grouped with the irish . 
  while if you have a group of both english and scottish people , they 're probably referred to as british though . 
  the irish are always irish . 
   plenty of welsh folk who would not be happy to hear your thoughts oh , man . 
  just to clarify , they 're not my personal thoughts ... 
  i know who you are wales !, 
  i was just trying to paint a basic but concise picture of how the general impressions of the uk are in sweden . 
  did n't mean to offend anyone , but apparently even my [ spelling ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ba5ioza.png ) did ... -- i know . 
  the idea of an independent scotland being allowed into the nordic council is quite supported here too afaik . 
  heck , quite a few of your regional flags even feature the glorious nordic cross . 
   i think there is something a bit tacky supporting the independence of a state you have nothing to do with i agree , but i do think there 's an important distinction to make between potentially being happy some country gains independence , and actively supporting it . 
  the vast vast * vast * majority of `` supporting '' foreigners i know would fall into the first category . 
  and it 's only something to be happy about if said country 's population actually wants to , at least in my book . 
   only the uk and canada have had the guts to give referenda to regions like this probably because most countries does n't have `` regions like those '' with anywhere near the support to warrant such a referendum . 
  of course there are some exceptions like spain etc. 
  but i think it has less to do with guts than it being a giant waste of time and money for most countries . 
   if other countries think it is so sexy they can organise their own plebiscites for their historic regions i mean , we could do that here , we have plenty of historical regions with distinct identities . 
  but ... not one region would get more than 10 % support . 
  not even scania . 
  probably not even 5 % . 
  to generalize ... scotland is scotland . 
  england is england . 
  wales is `` wales , england '' . 
  kind of . 
  northern ireland is northern ireland or `` english ireland '' . 
  the united kingdom is england ( colloquially ) , or great britain ( formally ) . 
  ( we do n't have a term for `` the uk '' ( sorry n.ireland ) ) scotland is often thought of being a bit separate from the rest of the uk . 
  we know it 's part of it , but scotland is ... scotland , not `` scotland , uk '' . 
  as in , scotland is only part of the uk de jure , not de facto . 
  kind of ... * ish * . 
  in my ( entirely anecdotal ) experience scotland probably has a favorable reputation compared to england . 
  with culture and values that seem slightly more aligned with our nordic ones . 
  quite a lot of people would like to see your independence , i think . 
  but i do n't know if brexit changed a lot of opinions really . 
  might have substantiated a few . 
  never . 
   people are carrying their skis and snowboards everywhere really only in alpine areas . 
  snowboards and alpine skiis are pretty useless on flat ground . 
  cross country skiis are quite widespread though . 
  in the middle of nowhere is probably where you 'll find most trails . 
  cross country skiing really is the best mode of ( human-powered ) transportation over snow . 
  snow shoes are clunky , regular shoes makes you very slow or even stuck , sleighs are good but too big etc. 
  and in the cities snow shoveling can be done to a greater extent . 
   are n't swedish and norwegian different languages ? 
  yes . 
  but mostly for political and historical reasons though . 
  in reality peninsular scandinavian act more as a dialect continuum , where one dialect gradients into the next and so on . 
  the languages are similar enough to be understood with just some exposure . 
  people who live on the border with norway , will not infrequently understand norwegian better than the scanian dialect * of swedish * etc. , because it 's similar and they 've had more exposure of it . 
   ` messerschmidt ' is a good word for a know-it-all . 
  * `` it 's actually called besserwisser !, 
  a tv-show from the 80 's , where a dumb character mistook the actual term , ` besserwisser ' , for ` messerschmitt ' . 
  and was promptly corrected by one . 
  normally messerschmitt is used satirically . 
  this is the first time in my life i 've seen someone use it to actually mean know-it-all . 
  but maybe that 's dialectal differences . 
  messerschmitt is not in the dictionary , besserwisser is . 
  -- edit : just to add , the sketch in the show went something along the lines of :  - you 're such a messerschmitt !, 
  - it 's actually called besserwisser . 
  - see ? 
  ah yes , how could i forget the famous swede descartes ? 
  victim of the illusive nationality by death . 
  here are a few : kings : - gustav i ( vasa ) : lead the swedish war of liberation againt christian ii ( a.k.a. 
  the tyrant ) . 
  - gustavus adolphus : founder of sweden as a great power scientists : - anders celsius : astronomer , physicist and mathematician . 
  created his own temperature scale among other things . 
  - carl linnaeus : father of modern taxonomy among other things . 
  also turned celsius ' scale around . 
  invented the dynamite amongst other things . 
  also founded the nobel prize . 
  diplomats : - dag hammarskj\u00f6ld : secretary-general of the united nations . 
  - raoul wallenberg : diplomat and humanitarian , helped jews during wwii . 
  artist and such : - carl michael bellman : songwriter and poet . 
  - august strindberg : bit of a polymath , mostly known for his authorship . 
  sports people : - bj\u00f6rn borg : tennis . 
  he was pretty good . 
  also famous for underwear . 
  - ingemar stenmark : alpine skier , made the hold country stop when he raced . 
  - zlatan ibrahimovi\u0107 : football player . 
  decent at kicking ball , i guess . 
  ... and many more . 
  yup . 
  we have about 65 000 shelters for housing 7 million people . 
  i 'm quite indifferent towards it . 
  in general i find small talk with strangers a waste of everyone 's time regardless of language . 
  but if you quickly switch over to english to say something you ca n't find the words for , my brain does too . 
  and then the conversation will have a high likelihood of staying english . 
  which admittedly is unfortunate if you 're trying to learn swedish and want practice . 
  do n't really know if we have one . 
  maybe * august strindberg * , as his works are typically cited as marking the end of nysvenska ( modern swedish ) and beginning of nusvenska ( contemporary swedish ) . 
  what ? 
  we do n't go there t. . . oh , right . 
  yes . 
  definitely doing that . 
  totally not spying while we wait for the next little ice age to gloriously march across the belts again and claim what 's rightfully ours . 
  we 're `` forgetting systembolaget '' . 
  if i were danish i 'd do my best to forget it too . 
  i certainly could , but ... 
  i only edit wikipedia pages when i have proper sources . 
  and as much as i believe you to be telling the truth , i 'm not sure `` reddit user / u/h2ppyme '' counts as a good reference .

  that white lion cub is the cutest thing ever !, 
  its a really good question . 
  and reddit hasnt really specified clearly where the line is drawn . 
  on sweddit we try and go by what we think is the intention of the rule . 
  and thats to not encourage a mob-mentality of hunting the person . 
  which has happened a few times in reddits history . 
  but if a newspaper posts the name its absoutley ok . 
  hm , suppose . 
  i 'll edit it out to avoid confusion . 
  it 's not our rule . 
  its reddits rule . 
  reddit.com/rules they 're really adiment that it should be enforced hard . 
  in this case their names , adress , personnumbers , appartment numbers , zipcode ( postnummer ) , city of residence , and citizenship for those who werent swedish citizens , were posted . 
  haha so you caught that . 
  no it wasnt pointed out by the court . 
  its just something ive learned since their information has been posted a couple of times in r/sweden .

yeah my original plan was to suggest a hannoverian-spanish-ottoman alliance . 
  but since spain dropped out and i could n't really see any at the time decent 3rd ally i did n't go for it then and since ottos were losing wars i was expecting them to win i kinda lost faith in the possibility of a hannoverian-ottoman alliance . 
  it had to be done pre-absolute monarchy for my troops to be able to match yours . 
  / u/romaneseuntdomusx did ditch his old alliance last time though , under the threat of italian invasion . 
  too much of my mid-late game plans got either screwd over by players dropping or me backing out of them due to being skeptical of the skill of some would-be key allies . 
  i was actually planning on positioning myself against the bohemia-prussia alliance before prussia could spike to much in power but since spain dropped out when i was gon na suggest an alliance that kinda ended up going down the drain and i could n't really find a potential alliance block strong enough to oppose your joint forces as you kept growing . 
  my own plan was for our alliance to end around 1620-1640 after the fall of france . 
  people seem to have decided to call the playthrough so i guess this is the end . 
  i 've updated the spreadsheet . 
  based on the save uploaded by chreo top 6 by spreadsheet gp determination 1 . 
  bohemia 3 . 
  ottomans top 6 by score with victory cards 1 . 
  ottomans 2 . 
  bohemia 3 . 
  ming top 6 by score without victory cards 1 . 
  ottomans 2 . 
  bohemia 6 . 
  bharat -- anyway climbing from opm to big shark was fun , in regards to starting a new playthrough next week i 'd like for there to be someone else that can take over hosting since i can only participate 1-2 more weekends at max meaning there is no point starting a new one unless someone else can run it . 
  either way i 'll ask around and we 'll see how it 'll be done , hopefully arathian is looking to jump back in . 
  beyond that i 'd suggest for the next playthrough the following rules looking at some of the issues we had this playthrough 1 . 
  top 3 ca n't ally 2 . 
  gps are top 8 and a gp can only have 1 other gp ally , non gps are limited to 2 gp allies . 
  gps are reduced to top 6 at 1650 , potentially not counted post 1750 and only the top 3 ca n't ally rule remains . 
  alliance limit is either lifted or set at dip relations slots/slots -1 . 
  could also just be a plain you + 3/4 people if people prefer that . 
  bringing a new ally in during a war is not allowed except via enforce peace . 
  if you pick a vassal or pu in the first round ( rule in regards to picking pu/vassal kept ) you have to achieve independance within 2 sessions/60years failure to do so or a failed independance war means losing control of your nation . 
  cn rules kept , limitation to nations supporting independance should match alliance limitations . 
  no timelimit on achieving independance alternatively very late game time limit 8 . 
  being force-vassalized/force-pu 'd means game over . 
  pu by monarch death should be either immediately dissolved or a similar limitation to starting subjects . 
  ex 30 years to get independance or so . 
  i 'm not really sure how well the new surrender system works but i suppose if it works well just some limitations on total amount of max warscore taken in a single war from players might be enough . 
  or one could run with no limitations and we 'll see how well it works but i 'd prob suggest some rule against releasing nations that are worth 100 warscore in that case . 
  -- in terms of determining gps i 'd suggest keeping the current spreadsheet way and doing the following adjustments to it 1 . 
  add 75 % of subject land force limit , exception ai colonial nations which will be added by 25 % of land forcelimit . 
  ( since they do n't interfere in wars outside the new world ) 2 . 
  increase the non-western tech modifier , first round post westernization a smaller tech modifier is kept and in the following rounds the tech modifier is counted as western . 
  guess its a isp thing then . 
  hmm , are you running on a wired broadband or a wireless one ? 
  next week is ai hannover week !, 
  chreo ( mexico ) will be hosting instead of me , 
  since i just noticed nobody tossed you a world map i 'll give you the ugly standard one [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rfsvn7o.png ), 
  you 're not looking intensly enough at iberia . 
  well we had 3 new players but at the same time 3 old players not returning , that said we are pretty close to the end at this point and considering the development in the new world its pretty much just your cns and maybe one of the remaining independant countries left there that can be considered worth picking imo . 
  there are n't exactly a lot of countries left and we 've got approx 125 years left which is at max 4 rounds presuming it is n't called earlier . 
  [ save game ] ( http://rghost.net/7ypm2gwzf ) , ottos abandoned tunis when i invaded them which gave your ai an opportunity to seize some land from them . 
  we had 13 players attending , new players on france , brazil and la plata with no attendance from ayuttaya , australia and tunis with no mention from any of these players . 
  please make some pretty maps !, 
  i decided to be nice and left the papal states ai alone even after ottos and france picked it up . 
  leon is a prussian vassal i believe though . 
  ca n't deny that . 
  referring to my beautiful hannoverian republic as dirty ottomans ... hannover , the most glorious of republics , the most glorious of european states , the deciding elector of the holy roman empire . 
  for any new players looking to jump in there is quite a few free countries in the new world available . 
  usa , portugal and mexico are the only current player controlled ones . 
  we are in 1656 and [ here is the world map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/unobl88.png ) for returning players i repeat my question in regards to whether there 's anyone who has good enough internet and computer as well as the necessary dlcs ( all content ones excluding mare nostrum ) to cover for me in the eventuality that i ca n't make it next week !, 
  -- also bohemia and papal states has made it clear they ca n't attend this week and thus have the right to take their nations back next week . 
  noted , although if you have the time please check out the discussion i just posted in the steam group !,

  only the host needs the expansions , so no . 
  persia actually became independant during this weeks round . 
  uzbek formed bukhara managed to get delhi and form mughals , although the country is sliced into pieces now . 
  hormuz decided to leave the game so viy nabbed it before ottos got the chance . 
  its already updated if you use the link in the post . 
  border gore is love , border gore is life . 
  pretty much everything is also in an article from svt , the swedish equivalent to britains bbc . 
  aside from that aftonbladet is one of the largest newspapers in sweden even if its a left-wing rag . 
  you did n't read the article eh ? 
  it even links to a swedish newspaper as a source . 
  original source is a swedish mainstream newspaper , the article even links to it . 
  that said i do n't think most newspapers are running the story . 
  do n't be silly , you have no ships . 
  its pretty correct yeah .

  well one of those losses was as a non-cobelligerent so there were no land loss . 
  usa is already a player country . 
  ironically swedish politicians did something similar post ww1 and the military was n't restored to its proper status until sometime after ww2 ended . 
  such beauty . 
  short recap : people decided to use france as an extra alliance while it was ai so my alliance annulled all its alliances . 
  it then allied the papal states ai that had broken with venice . 
  towards the end the ottoman ai decided it could take the france-papal states alliance so it declared for its cores . 
  have n't actually had the time to play a lot of eu4 outside of this mp so my experience with the new patch is pretty much 0 . 
  you 've lost parma and firenze in europe , but other than that you 're alive . 
  might be some more overseas losses though . 
  alliances are a bit messed up since neither you , france nor ottomans had a replacement and thus were ai this session . 
  rhak will prob do a post with a bunch of in game screenshots from the end .

  1591 , so its mid game . 
  cns are probably the main thing you could grab although there 's a decent chance some players might not show due to not wanting to continue on this patch . 
  aside from that there are a few players in this thread who have asked to have someone cover their nation for this session . 
  aside from colonial nations you could always cover for someone who is missing today , at least the papal state and possibly bharat as well are needing replacement . 
  not sure if bharat took the guy ming offered . 
  ah i think i forgot to upload the save after last round , been really busy today .

  `` in sweden , this is the first finding of mrsa in cattle and the first detection of mrsa harbouring mecc of domestic animal origin '' . 
  and you concentrate on the lying part , because i did n't know this , instead of comparing that to the 88 % of the pigs in danish slaughterhouses . 
  b ) , now you are n't even trying to argue properly anymore , in the article i sent you ( the latest to , you have n't even adressed the first five ) , it said that 88 % of the pigs have mrsa . 
  that is no * no way * comparable to this strain that has n't even infected anyone . 
  you are n't properly arguing , you are being childish now . 
  as with your very childish comment about cold and mrsa . 
  are you going to argue , or just try to find tiny , tiny things you can attack when missing the big picture ? 
  are you going to critiscise my spelling to , just becaue my english is not as good as yours ? 
  your comment about denmark being better in general - is that how you conduct a scientific argument ? 
  honestly , if this is how you are going to do it , we might as well quit . 
  i guess you have never gone to uni or anything , or are you possibly still in school ? 
  that would explain that you argue so badly . 
  so , please , write a scientific and well versed argument as to why danish meat is superior to swedish , and back it up with several scientific articles , please . 
  and here is how more and more people are getting infected with this quality meat . 
  did i mention we do n't have it ? 
  so , now i am really , really want to hear why danish mrsa is better than swedish non mrsa . 
  here is another link about mrsa in danish pigs . 
  ! had them . 
  again , explain to me how it is good . 
  do you think mrsa means good quality ? 
  why do you think that . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.themeatsite.com/meatnews/20243/ministers-examine-rising-mrsa-prevalence-in-danish-pigs ), 
  again , you do not deal with facts now . 
  now you are just making nationalistic and incorrect climate assumptions . 
  for example , right across dk , just a few kilometers , there is far less mrsa , because we fight it , on a national level . 
  not because of the climate . 
  the climate is basically the same in malm\u00f6 and k\u00f6penhamn for example , and sk\u00e5ne is one of the bigges agricultural areas in sweden . 
  also , with regards to the cold , russia and canada has more mrsa than we do . 
  it is rather easy to see that you do not deal with facts . 
  please , i am waiting for links and facts , not incorrect unfunny comments . 
   so one has to assume that their meat is better too . 
  that says all about you . 
  assumptions , not facts . 
  pulled out of you backside i assume . 
  please , in this discussion we deal with facts . 
  please , again , i am waiting for the scientific links . 
  science do not do assumptions . 
  we deal with facts . 
  so , stop assuming and back up your statement that danish meat is superior to swedish . 
  and in particular why meat with salmonella and mrsa is better than meat without it.i i have access to academic journals so that will not be a problem . 
  it is n't . 
  and i am still waiting for an explanation as to why my links , which you could n't be bothered to read are wrong . 
  and why mrsa and salmonella in meat is a better meat than meat in a country that has no mrsa and hardly any salmonella . 
  but please , do not take my word for it - google mrsa and sweden . 
  we are one of the top fighting countries . 
  or salmonella denmark . 
  just google it , and then explain why danish meat is better . 
  i am waiting . 
  and other meat too ... but , i gave you five links now and i am so excited to hear you explain why danish meat is better than swedish and why mrsa and salmonella is good . 
  is there any products from there that a non italian might come across , so i can avoid them . 
  i 've heard italians do the same . 
  it is unfortunate but i do n't want to risk my health , i want them to fix this . 
  maybe an international boycott will force someone to act . 
  any wine i should n't drink ? 
  since you ca n't read . 
  please prove all these links wrong . 
  with science , not your anecdotes . 
  because you are better than argentina . 
  [ 5 ] ( http://antibiotics-theperfectstorm.blogspot.se/2011/11/perfect-storm-intensifies.html ) .

   so most people say it is absolutely safe for 100 ' 000 + years , but some people say we really do n't know . 
  the * scientists and the international agencies says yes * . 
  honestly , if you are going to use arguments like `` some people '' , i 'd like to have scientific links . 
  why are the scientists wrong ? 
  links please to the adequate sources ? 
   but we ca n't really know until we tested it for 100 ' 000 + years . 
  yes we can , that is why we have science . 
  do n't you belive in science . 
  if you are going to say all scientists are wrong , i want * credible * links from academic journals please . 
  yes we can . 
  the link i sent you just said that . 
   so most people say it is absolutely safe for 100 ' 000 + years , but some people say we really do n't know yes i did . 
  apperently you do not like to read . 
  in my argument with simonask . 
  please go through the thread and read them . 
   some other countries maybe . 
  but not every country has vast areas of uninhabited land like finland and sweden do . 
  wrong . 
  all you need is earth . 
  it is not in the most unihabited areas of sweden/finland either , not by far . 
  it is about 200 km from stockholm . 
  honestly do you think we dump uranium in a ditch ? 
  as long as you can go * down * which almost every european country can ( maybe not greece , southern italy and other earth quakes areas ) you can store it.so , that means that 90 % of europe can store it , so that argument does not hold . 
   and last but not least whether nuclear power is truly less of a problem for the environment is n't so clear for me as nuclear power has destroyed many places in many parts of the world . 
  ( like parts of siberia , where the russians have their nuclear u-boat cemeteries ) . 
  no , coal kills more than 1 million/year , radiation 17 000 . 
  that is a fact . 
  and how much do you think the global warming is ruining . 
  your glaciers are melting , and maybe you are not dying because of global warming , but people in bangladesh are . 
   that the global warming is a huge problem is obviously true , but i do not believe that nuclear power is really a solution , it just defers the problem . 
  there is not perfect solution , but it is far , far better than coal . 
  we ca n't just hang around waiting for something to happen . 
  what you are saying is `` i prefer coal and death , pollution and co2 emissions to the best available technique that give nothing , or far less than that '' . 
  i honestly ca n't begin to understand how one can say that . 
  no , nuclear is n't perfect , but as i have proven , we can store it , far less people die and no co2 emissions . 
  yet you prefer coal or fossil fuels ( which is the case in almost every country , maybe not switzerland ) . 
  we do n't have time to wait for the perfect energy source , we have to act now . 
  how can one then choose co2 emissions over no co2 emissions ? 
  i really ca n't understand that .

  it 's not that shocking . 
  the same can be said about china 's transition from the madness of mao 's reign to the relative stability of the reform era . 
  there are many other examples . 
  countries can change very rapidly if there is the political will required . 
   work ethics , access to the health system could you expand on this ? 
  most of breivik 's victims were ethnic norwegians . 
  [ here 's the crime graph ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/number_of_crimes_reported_per_100%2c000_population_in_sweden%2c_1993-2013.svg ) for sweden . 
  the red line at the bottom is intentional homicide . 
  could we have done better ? 
  sure . 
  is the rhetoric on reddit congruent with reality of the last 20 years ? 
  munich police says : no indications of islamic terror https://twitter.com/sz_muenchen/status/756576315373916164, 
  actually the world has been getting better than ever . 
  the amount of people in absolute poverty has been dropping to record lows , the amount of people dying in wars is at all-time lows etc. 
  the media 's long-time `` if it bleeds , it leads '' mantra is getting to people . 
  but it is n't reality , because you never read about the good stuff that is happening in the background , incrementally accruing dividends for humanity . 
  except all indications we have is that this guy ( or group ) are ethnic germans . 
  and they could be inspired by breivik considering that it is exactly 5 years ago on this day he massmurdered people . 
  with attitudes like that , what a shock that yugoslavia descended into a bloodbath . 
  yeah , they do n't count because they are muslims . 
  take the aggregate of balkan states and compare it to an aggregate of the major western european nations . 
  you 'll find what i told you from the beginning : you 're * not * safer in the region as a whole . 
  if you want to cherry-pick only croatia then i can play that game too and only cherry-pick the country in western europe which has the lowest homicide rate as well . 
  you 'll lose in that instance too . 
  any fair comparison involves the * whole * region and in any such comparison , the balkans are less safe than western europe . 
  it 's not even that close . 
   i do n't know why this video does n't seem like a terrorist attack , there 's no evidence against that fair point . 
  that 's why i prefaced it with islamic , because so many wanted it to be a brown guy going kamikaze . 
  still , terrorism is often laced with a political aim and/or ideological color . 
  breivik certainly had his , so did the attackers in paris and bruessels . 
  by contrast , was columbine a terrorist attack ? 
  did they have any ideology ? 
  the unabomber was a terrorist , because he had a political aim . 
  so , the jury is still out whether this will be classified as terrorism or not depending upon what their motive is . 
  could be another breivik-type of terrorist .

   belgrade and sarajevo is a must you been there before ? 
  asking because it sounds like you speak from experience . 
  croatia has a homicide rate of 0.8 while sweden is at 0.9 . 
  not exactly a huge difference . 
  also , croatia is the most prosperous part of the balkans , did you forget what i wrote ? 
   life in the balkans , certainly the poorer parts for the vast majority of people in the balkans , life is ** not ** safer than in western europe . 
  knock yourself out and see if you think what i wrote is incorrect : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate, 
  someone mirror this before twitter takes it down : https://twitter.com/montymetzger/status/756540722510237697/video/1 does * not * seem like an islamic terrorist ( the far-right will weep ) , rather a planned rampage . 
  two points . 
  human smuggling chains often have many links , like all chains . 
  the balkan mafia take the `` last mile ( s ) '' responsibility . 
  the local policing will get those in their vincinity . 
  the calais police does not have jurisidiction in mali or afghanistan or nigeria . 
  if the police in those places was as effective as the french , then we 'd see a lot more arrests on location . 
  as i said , not the source , but complicit at the very end of the trip . 
  curious , how did you like it and were were you in the country , aside from the adriatic coast ? 
  top bants , scotbro , 
  doubt it . 
  terrorism brings with it a lot of headlines , but everyday murderers kills far more people . 
  life in the balkans , certainly the poorer parts , is far less safe for the average citizen than what life is in western europe . 
   it 's also well known that smugglers from balkans mafia are the main source of the massive illegal immigration and human traffic . 
  not true . 
  the most important smugglers are based outside the eu , that 's how they give a way into the continent to begin with . 
  the networks from places like pakistan , syria , mali and other nations are run and controlled by groups based in those nations . 
  the balkan mafia are merely the endpoint for the network , not the source . 
  they are complicit , yes , but not the main drivers . 
  what you said about guns is true , though . 
  every single one of them . 
  of course he is allowed to form his opinions . 
  but when his country has drained hundreds of billions of ** bailouts ** , which are non-productive unlike investment in infrastructure in ee , then you should be humble , is my humble suggestion ( pun unintended ) . 
  i do n't see that as an unreasonable demand . 
  to top it all off , he slurs them as a bunch of freeriders/leeches which is the most tiresome and oldest attack made on ee countries whenever they speak up . 
  the message could n't be clearer : the eu is * not * an equal club and you need to shut the fuck up and do what you 're told . 
  that approach wo n't fly much longer . 
  also , as a final word , i do want people to reflect for just one moment that 0.1 % of their nation 's gni is spent on development aid in the eu . 
  whenever you hear populist nonsense about billions , remember that the eu economy is in the many trillions and that the roi on those billions is many times repaid . 
  it 's not a static gift , western companies profit greatly from that development from increased trade and higher development . 
  plus we have n't even talked about the massive demographic loss that ee nations have suffered the last 20 years , which benefitted western european economies . 
  those costs dwarf any development aid * easily * . 
  it 's time to admit these people have more than a rightful say in the eu and end the baseless attacks , the slurs and the misleading bullshit that is only aimed at silencing them and delegitimising their voices by scapegoating them as leeches uninterested in the european project . 
  it 's a slur and it needs to be called out . 
  either we are a union of equals or we are not . 
  it 's that simple . 
   ireland is on top of the list of places i want to give my life , my devotion honest question : why not poland ? 
  is it only about the money ? 
  do you honestly think even 10 % will leave ? 
  may is n't dumb . 
  she knows keeping them in the uk is good for the economy . 
  if she had her way , the uk would even keep membership in the single market with some adjustments to free movement . 
  either way , i expect the vast majority of poles to stay . 
  at this stage , erdogan and putin must be trump 's biggest fanboys . 
  the only question is how many maga hats they have ordered . 
  do n't play stupid . 
  by overtly suggesting they are only in it for the money , you are directly sending the message that they do n't care about the eu in of itself - and who would want leeches to have a say ? 
  it 's a slur and you know it . 
  stand by your attack on them instead of trying to worm yourself out . 
   what has what you said got to do with anything i said ? 
  try this :  poor eu states are ** only in the eu for the free money ** which is fundamentally bullshit . 
  i already addressed this when i wrote :  for too long we 've considered the poorer states as basically people who do n't have a say . 
  if they believe another direction of the eu should be taken , we should listen to them , instead of dismissing them as beggars . 
  pay attention . 
  fair points . 
   this is also a reason why i do n't understand the ignorance of so many right wing parties at this moment for forbidding dual citizenship as they can use it to their benefit . 
  because they are stupid .

  islamic extremism has n't disappeared and afghanistan is still in bad shape , but that 's no excuse for not pursuing those responsible . 
  no it was n't . 
  the taliban government was harboring those responsible for 9/11 .

  yeah i got ta agree with this , at least from my perspective here in sweden . 
  i 've met very few people who are emotionally invested in the eu , and i definitely have n't met anyone who wants federalization .

  ** spain signals it would block eu air access deal unless terms exclude gibraltar airport ** the anglo-spanish tussle over the rock of gibraltar has emerged as a significant hazard in britain 's search for an ambitious brexit deal to preserve access to europe 's skies for its # 60bn airline industry . 
  while spain has made positive overtures to london since the brexit vote and warned europe against seeking a punitive deal , it has also signalled it would block uk access to the eu 's single aviation market unless the terms exclude gibraltar 's international airport . 
  `` any eu agreement with the uk on aviation can not apply to the airport of gibraltar , '' said one spanish diplomat . 
  `` a deal that is applicable to the airport of gibraltar would imply recognition of the legal right of the uk to the territory . '' the comments suggest a 300-year political dispute over the rock -- which is currently holding-up three pieces of airline legislation in brussels -- could spill into some of the key elements of the brexit negotiations . 
  the uk 's post-brexit air access options include attempting to retain membership of the european common aviation area , which would mean it keeps full access , or seek a bilateral `` open skies '' agreement with the eu , which is likely to have more restrictive terms . 
  both deals would , however , require unanimous support from all eu member states . 
  the diplomatic warning suggests that spain is not prepared to accept a deal in which gibraltar airport is given the same rights as uk mainland airports . 
  spain argues that gibraltar airport is illegally located on spanish land . 
  it says the 1713 treaty of utrecht , which ceded the town , castle and port of gibraltar to britain , did not include the rights to the isthmus on which the airport is built . 
  a deal to maintain access to europe 's skies is vital for the uk airline industry . 
  the creation of the single aviation market sharply increased the number of airlines operating across the eu and lowered fares . 
  it also ensured easier access to the us , canada and elsewhere . 
  gibraltar airport currently handles up to nine arrivals a day , all of which come from either the uk or morocco . 
  only four airlines use the airport : british airways , easyjet , monarch and royal air maroc . 
  the disagreement over gibraltar airport is holding up a number of eu aviation laws that have been frozen pending a solution . 
  a revision to passenger rights on issues of compensation , such as when a flight is delayed or cancelled , was first proposed in 2013 , but has been frozen . 
  eu legislation on airport slots and rules aimed at simplifying air traffic management and reducing flight times has also failed to come into force due to the gibraltar dispute . 
  the uk has previously dismissed spain 's role in the stalled legislation as `` political point scoring '' . 
  in 2014 , then uk foreign secretary philip hammond said madrid was using the aviation dispute as a means of `` forcing sovereignty negotiations on gibraltar '' . 
  spain has said that until an agreement is reached , any attempt to apply the regulations would mean the eu is taking the uk 's side . 
  this thread is great already . 
  i think i 'll wait and hear what they all say in negotiations instead of assuming what some people mean by punishing . 
  either way i 'd hope that punishment is n't on the cards . 
  what , does everyone else want to punish the uk ? 
  lol, 
  yeah . 
  do n't get me wrong , ireland is doing well ... but you know the number is skewed when they have a higher gdp per capita than norway or switzerland . 
  i said that your complaint is petty and your statistics wrong . 
  do you expect me to sit here and draw up theories on how this could work because you said so ? 
  no thank you , i have better things to do with my time . 
  my point was that the uk and ireland are intertwined in a lot of ways that other nations are n't . 
  no border between them , dual citizens in northern ireland etc. 
   how 's the cta going to stop eu citizens passing freely from the republic into the uk ? 
  not for me to figure out . 
  i just think your complaint is petty . 
  that seems like a very petty thing to complain about . 
  they mention below that it excludes the roi ; i suppose because the cta between them has existed for longer than the eu has . 
  plus the relationship between the uk and ireland is fairly unique . 
  also , ireland does n't have the highest number of brits outside the uk . 
  [ in the eu , spain and france have more ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/27/fewer-britons-in-rest-of-europe-than-previously-thought-ons-research ) . 
  outside the eu there are several other countries with more brits in them . 
  do you mind pointing out where in the paper they say that ? 
  without jumping into the rest of this discussion , i 'll just add that [ this ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/27/fewer-britons-in-rest-of-europe-than-previously-thought-ons-research ) is where he gets the number . 
  fairly new development .

  then `` fuck the united states of amerikka , we can ally with china instead '', 
  well , i 'm sorry about what happened to your friends . 
  my dad is from latvia and he has lived in first wales and then england for two decades now . 
  he 's never had any problems . 
  a few dickheads take our their anger on eastern europeans because many of them moved to the uk , but xenophobia is not the norm . 
  also reddit is n't representative at all . 
  four years ago . 
  i still travel back to the uk several times a year for longer holidays though . 
  well since the referendum there have been cases where people who hold xenophobic opinions thought that they were in good company . 
  i think its the usual suspects who are louder in that case . 
  i certainly have n't noticed any difference day to day and neither has my dad ( eastern european who has lived in both wales and england for two decades now ) . 
  well i used to live in the uk as an eu citizen and i disagree . 
  many people do n't like the eu as an organization ( a trait hardly unique to britain ) but hate for eu citizens is n't common at all . 
  i used to live in the uk . 
  there is of course a group of people who will buy into everything the express says , but most have no hate of europeans . 
  even among those who voted leave there is no unified opinion that the eu should `` be brought down '' . 
  actual hate for people on the continent is a fringe opinion . 
  to be fair , this is donald trump and his picks talking . 
  not `` the anglos '' . 
  there is no special anglo hate for europeans like you suggest . 
  go to 8:45 . 
  i saw this yesterday live and i was amazed at what i just heard . 
  in response to why he wants to be the ambassador when he clearly does n't like the eu . 
  `` well i had in a previous career a diplomatic post where i helped bring down the soviet union . 
  so maybe there 's another union that needs a little taming . '', 
  edit : also his opinons on juncker at 9:30 `` mr juncker was very adequate mayor ( ?? 
  ) , i think of some city in luxembourg , and maybe he should go back and do that again . '', 
  nah , i 'm a swede who used to live in the uk . 
  i still have close ties to britain so i travel back very often to see friends and family . 
  just tired of all the nonstop bashing on here . 
  racist england , dreaming about the empire etc. 
  and most of the people parotting this nonsense have never been to the uk outside of a weekend shopping trip to london . 
  do n't you ever get bored of bashing the uk and writing nonsensical texts about brexit ? 
  it 's been 7 months and you are still rambling on .

   these men are n't there because they just opened up a new terrorist field school , they 're there because in islamic culture young men are supposed to answer the call when fellow muslims are engaged in a struggle like civil war ( or a jihad , depending on your bias ) . 
  apart , from the fact , that it is not the reason why swedish muslim men go at least . 
  they go to fight and die , for extremely hard core , radical organisations . 
  furthermore , a moderate muslim knows that is is wrong to a ) kill b ) kill other muslims . 
   i responded directly to what you took issue with . 
  no , i asked you what * your * problems with the swedish health care was , for example bad care . 
  you , and klaus , seem to have no clue what you are talking about , really . 
  everything is so wrong , that i ca n't even begin to point it out . 
  for example , if the swedish health care is so bad , why do we have some of the best survival rates in cancer ? 
  best survival rates for newborns etc. 
   i do not see what that has to do with understanding this article . 
  no , but the article is wrong . 
  you do not seem to get that , nor do you ( or klaus ) even seem to know basic swedish history . 
   our recovery is certainly behind you sweden since 2009 : why ? 
  what have you done ( or not done ) differently ? 
  i ca n't come up with anything really . 
   generally people blame loss of competitiveness , and there 's many reasons for that . 
  yes , but is n't euro one reason ? 
  i mean , you have suffered since the euro crises . 
  we have n't . 
  i do n't see how one can * not * factor in the euro . 
   he swedish miracle happened between 1860 to 1950 while they had the freest economy in the world and kept away from any form of conflict . 
  i know all this , but it is easier to grow if you are a poor economy . 
  it is just plain stupid to expect , from a mature economy , the same growth year after year . 
  also , it is idiotic to compare with the economy in the 1860 's . 
  do you expect china to have the same growth in 150 years ? 
   90 's the sweedish government had to cut 25 % of their state size in order to survive . 
  yes , i remember that and it was good . 
  what in god 's name does that has to do with anything though . 
   also , i 'm detecting some religious undertones in your argument i 'm an atheist , if you read religion into our argument , it says so much more about you , than me . 
   it 's just that the way you present it is sheer vilification . 
  why - the fact is that you have n't fixed it for 40 years . 
  is that villification ? 
  i mean , you agree with me that the system in greece is due to the fact that the greek people build it that way . 
  you even wrote  i agree that a large part of the population was complicit where is the vilification - we agree . 
   that does n't justify your extreme hatred and prejudice . 
  what is the extreme hatred ? 
  i do n't hate the greeks , but for over 40 years , a majority have chosen a corrupt an inefficient system , because they wanted to . 
  personally i think it is fucked up and would have chosen the finnish way . 
   so while i agree that the tax revenue as a percentage of gdp in greece is low , i do n't think that justifies any punishment or hatred . 
  again - what is the hatred ? 
  * you just agreed to the fact that that average greek has profited from your corrupt system - an average greek person have paid less than a finnish person . 
  * how is that hatred ? 
  when it comes to punishment - what ? 
  give me a list of punishment . 
  furthermore , ca n't you see that the greeks have wanted the level of service one has in finland , but you have n't wanted to pay for it like the finns - do n't you realise that somethings got to give ? 
  and , the fact is , that while the economy is n't nice today ( which also has a lot to do with the euro , which i hate , but a whole different discussion ) * you * , the greeks have n't paid a lot of money , not at all , in comparison to the north . 
  you have made money from your corrupt system , but now you have to pay . 
  i guess you still have paid less than the finns , even today . 
  so , if you want to change it , you have to pay . 
  but the greks do n't , still , and as long as the greeks cheat on their taxes , the standard services will stay low . 
  cause and effect - not punishment , but a choice by the greek people . 
   i have done so all my fucking life . 
  good , i am glad to hear that . 
  now , if i can see a demonstration in athens agains tax cheaters , i 'd be happy :-) . 
   it 's unfair that greece 's economy is driven to suicide . 
  that is mostly because the euro is a fucked up currency , but that is a whole different discussion . 
  i do not like the euro . 
  i think you should leave it , honestly , i think it would be better for you . 
  what you perceive as punishment is the fact that you are competing with the north , while being less efficient ( even if the greeks work hard , as they do , they produce less ) and the only way you can compete is by pushing down salaries . 
  at the same time the products you used to produce are less attractive since they are more expensive . 
  i do n't like it either , but on this board , the euro is a good currency . 
  i hate it . 
  however , it is not wilfull punishment , it is economics 101 , `` what happens when you have a badly constructed currency '' . 
  it is important to separate those two . 
  also , you have to see it from the view of the average tax payer up north . 
  they never voted for paying for anyone else , and now they have to . 
  part of it ( which they do n't get ) is the extremely idiotic euro , but part of it , is for the fact that the greeks choose to build up a system that is fucked up . 
  and , honestly - why on earth should they pay for the second part , at all ? 
  even now they pay more in taxes than you do . 
  what is fair and unfair now ? 
   i do n't like indiscriminate layoffs of thousands of people . 
  so , fire the inefficient ones . 
  why are n't you ? 
  it is not going to be perfect , of course not . 
  you seem to think that the eu can sit and point and say `` x is inefficient let us fire him '' . 
  of course they have no clue . 
  you will have to fix that . 
  i am swedish and using our health care , twice a week . 
  i know it . 
  neither you nor klaus seem to have a clue , and you are not answering my questiojns . 
  why not ? 
  i have asked you to come up with facts - apparently you can not . 
  what do * you * dislike with the swedish system . 
  have you bee here ? 
  i believe with regard to taxes he was discussing the 1950 's era . 
  well , then he is wrong - again . 
  besides he is an idiot , if he compares sweden from the 1950 's with today - we were one of the few countries who a ) not invaded by the sovietunion b ) not bombed to bits and pieces . 
  he is wrong about almost everything . 
  why do you have such a hard on for him ? 
  i live here , i use our health care . 
  do you even speak swedish ? 
   you seem to think that troika is trying to solve the structural problems of these countries , but that 's happening . 
  no , not at all . 
  only spain/greece can solve their own problems , the troika can only point the directions . 
  ( and , but for a whole different discussion , a lot of the problems are due to the euro , which i do not like , however , now we are discussing the problems that greece/spain can adress themselves ) . 
  second - i have no idea of how the spanish public sector was/is , so i am not going to discuss that . 
  also , spain is not even remotely as corrupt as greece is , so i think you have a better starting point . 
  however , greeces public sector is inefficient as shit , thus people should be fired . 
  why pay for inefficent people , that they 've even hired for life .

  i 'm pretty hyped for this movie , i trust nolan that he 'll get it right . 
  plus ww2 is a very interesting topic . 
  this was 2012 ; it 'd be interesting to see what has changed since then . 
  i wonder if greece 's number is higher given the economic difficulties they 've gone through since then , or if they stick to the southern european way of low suicide rates . 
  christ ... canada must be unbearable . 
  is north dakota particularly cold for its location or is it similar in neighbouring states like minnesota ? 
  yeah , it 's the gulf steam . 
  but holy shit , -29 ? 
  is it always that cold in north dakota this time of year ? 
  wow , that already exists too ? 
  i only just found / r/the _ schulz a few days ago , i have no idea why him specifically . 
  i can understand donald trump or nigel farage because of their quotes and personalities , but does schulz behave any differently to the average boring politician ? 
  eu approval rating in greece probably going to drop even more , like its not already super low . 
  yeah i agree . 
  honestly ukip is probably the most tame out of all these `` far right '' or `` populist right '' or whatever you want to call them . 
  i was thinking about hungary and slovakia , more specifically jobbik and people 's party our slovakia . 
  also , did you misread ? 
  i wrote eastern ; when i think of central i think of czech republic and austria . 
  damn , that 's harsh . 
  i always saw her and her party as one of the more extreme in western and northern europe , compared to sd , dpp , ukip etc. 
  not sure about afd . 
  although eastern europe definitely has more extreme parties . 
  i 'll add that it 's not all ... i have seen reasonable and calm people with every flair on here . 
  but yes , without mentioning any names , there are some loud romanians on here who constantly trash the uk . 
  i 'm not talking about normal banter either . 
  the independent is a low quality clickbait paper , but they were n't the ones who did the survey . 
  that was [ yougov ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/12/05/many-europeans-say-immigration-has-meant-they-dont/ ), 
  so 15 % of poles think that there are so many immigrants in poland , that it does n't feel like home any more . 
  how the fuck ? 
  are they trolling ? 
  [ or better yet ... just check polls over time to see the trend . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_swedish_general_election,_2018 ), 
  yep . 
  an area that on estimate voted 72 % remain ; was lib dem in 1997 when the boundaries were drawn , remained lib dem in 2005 and went conservative in 2010 . 
  now its lib dem again . 
  stop the presses . 
   the actions against women were supported by imams and muslim religious leaders , who declared that bengali women were ` war-booty ' ... wow . 
  i 'm shocked but at the same time , i 'm really not . 
  i know why free movement exists . 
  i mean that it 's not fair on non-eu immigrants that if the uk wants to cut immigration it needs to make it incredibly hard to immigrate from outside the eu because immigrants from the eu can come at whatever pace they want . 
  essentially they 'll have to deny a lot of potential talent if they want to keep the numbers down . 
  it 's totally unrealistic when people say that they should just stop all non-eu immigration to solve the problem . 
  how did i miss that you linked an article , even the same , in your comment ? 
  for some reason i did n't see it , my bad . 
  it 's a fall in people from western europe yes , but eastern europe as a whole has increased . 
  should n't they be the most pushed away because of perceived xenophobia ? 
  also we do n't know if it 's seasonal or not . 
  romanians and bulgarians are some of the biggest groups working seasonally and their number decreased . 
   i think brexit has worked in pushing away eu migrants , so do n't worry . 
  [ no signs of that yet at least . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/16/surge-eastern-europeans-working-uk-since-eu-referendum-brexit ), 
  making it almost impossible for people outside the eu to move to the uk while having no restriction at all for people coming from the eu hardly sounds fair or optimal . 
  nope . 
  i 'm biased though , i used to live there and i have close ties to the country . 
  i guess its different for those who are federalists or who feel really passionate about the eu but for me it does n't matter at all if brits are in or out . 
  i love you guys all the same . 
  so much bullshit in one comment , i 'd be surprised if anyone bothers trying to debunk this nonsense . 
  brexit polling was not that far off to be honest . 
  it was very close and within the margin of error . 
  the reason why it came as a shock was because of a few last minute polls favouring remain and the belief that people would stick to the status quo . 
  i only just realized last week that the rerun of the austrian presidential vote is on the same day as the italian referendum . 
  feels like i should put money on le pen . 
  i chickened out on putting any on trump even though i wanted to ... we all know how that went . 
  link me some of his constant warmongering then . 
  if you mean repeating that gibraltar is british and always will be , then i do n't see the problem seeming as the spanish government wo n't shut up about wanting it to be under spanish control . 
  oh and i 'm swedish , so it 's not `` my colony '' . 
  i was there on holiday once though , nice place . 
  except nobody even cares about fabian picardo . 
  he was in contact with the commander of the armed forces in gibraltar ; in what way is this strange or an attempt to rile people up ? 
  also lol @ thinking that the uk is a failure yet touting your achievement as healthcare not being privatized , even when the nhs is n't privatized either . 
  my mother is spanish and i like your country too much to start hurling insults , but its laughable that a spaniard thinks they can call the uk a failure of a country . 
  do you think this is some massive story in the uk ? 
  do you see politicians riling up people about a warning flare ? 
  i only see mad spaniards in this thread , nobody else cares . 
  also if the uk is a failure of a country , i 'd like to hear what country you live in . 
  presumably your country has achieved way more than britain ever has , right ? 
  in my opinion , several of her policies were necessary . 
  her biggest failure was not investing in some kind of future for those areas whose industries could n't produce a profit anymore . 
  but the world was changing , the government could n't subsidize everything forever . 
  also it 's worth noting that reddit is different from the general population ; she is very controversial , both hated and loved by many different people . 
  she still tops lists of best prime minister . 
  yep . 
  did n't make it clear in my original comment but i agree , it 's not only immigration although that certainly plays a huge part . 
  sarkozy is tarnished with his political reputation too ; a lot of people who vote le pen are looking for a big change from people exactly like sarkozy . 
  she probably is ; and personality does play a role , correct . 
  but the guy says this  they are more interested in the performance , in the theatrical quality of what is said than whether it is true . 
  and as we know , a fascist can put on a very successful performance . 
  totally missing the point regarding why support for her party has grown so much . 
  and then if she wins he 'll panic and wo n't understand why people voted for her . 
   as for le pen it is unlikely that she wins but it is possible , and that is partly because the people have lost interest in policy , instead focusing on personality . 
  no you idiot , it 's not a coincidence that she is polling well on an anti-immigration and anti-islam platform . 
  it has everything to do with policy and a huge backlash against mass immigration , especially from islamic countries . 
  must suck being norweigan/swiss and a fan of these interesting maps ... half of them do n't include norway or switzerland . 
  it 's no big deal . 
  you were n't the only angry person on here after the brexit vote . 
  if you find it infuriating to hear , just stop commenting ? 
  we both have lives outside of this right ? 
  no need to take everything so personallly . 
  i have nothing more to add and i have lunch soon , but you said you were curious about which other account i meant so i responded . 
  initially i was wondering what other ridiculous crap you 've got considering your comment above about jews .

  it was estonias who developed the platform and had the technology from the beginning . 
  however it was indeed a swede and a dane who owned it , and i guess it was them who got most ( if not all ) of the capital at the exit . 
  it 's kind of like soundcloud in berlin , germany . 
  it 's founded by two swedes , but it 's still not a `` swedish company '' . 
  great , more eu regulations to destroy what already works . 
  not 6 billion but there exists start ups that have had some big exits in sweden , like mysql ( 1 billion usd ) and qliktech ( around 2 billion usd , i think ) . 
  now with rovio , supercell , spotify , klarna and king.com etc the nordic start up market is quite hot . 
  it 's mostly because of populism . 
  they want to increase the status of teachers , and recently you could get a place at the `` teacher education '' with only 0.1 points ( because there were so few applicants ) , so this is supposed to help raise the standards of teachers !, 
  ** sweden ** * sweden 's mens hockey team is in the final against canada - playing in 1 hour . 
  * bronze and silver medals in curling . 
  * the government will tighten the rules for admission to university ( it will only affect those with the worst grades ) . 
  * managers who bullied an employee ( who later killed himself ) has been convicted . 
  the court says that the managers are guilty involuntary manslaughter . 
  * the princess madeleine has given birth to a daughter . 
  i think most people think of eu as a bureaucratic mess that 's taking money , with a big democracy deficit . 
  most people do not even care about the eu elections . 
  it 's more of a peace project than anything else for swedes . 
  edit : in a eurobarometer from 2011 [ they asked what people thought was good about eu ] ( http://imgur.com/a/6n5xk ) , it shows my point of most swedes seeing it as a `` peace project '' . 
  they have not completely merged scania and man yet , however today vw is making bids to buy the last remaining shares in scania . 
  now they are going to use the `` synergies '' to save money , which means less jobs . 
  i just find it sad that swedish jobs will be moved to germany because of eu rules . 
  but sweden and the nordic countries is a really small market . 
  it just shows how the monopoly rules does n't work . 
  i 'm sure that man has a 90 % market share in one of the states in germany , which is comparable to a country as sweden . 
  yeah , but vw owns a majority in man trucks and with scania it is the biggest truck manufacturer in europe . 
  the problem is that germany is dominating the eu and can alter the rules to fit german interests . 
  in 1999 volvo wanted to take over the swedish truck maker scania , but that was considered `` monopoly '' . 
  now that vw want to take over it , it 's okay . 
  german corruption ftw ... 
  then i guess all statistics is meaningless as you can never be 100 % sure that it 's reliable . 
  i do n't know any other places in russia except for moscow , sochi and st. petersburg . 
  so sochi it 'd be then . 
  it looks dirty as fuck in stockholm too when the snow is melting ( with gravel on top ) . 
  swedes eat lutfisk during christmas , at least my parents . 
  still pretty exciting that a swedish culture has lived on in minnesota . 
  makes me want to visit !, 
  if you are more interested in sweden , you should watch the swedish show `` allt f\u00f6r sverige '' . 
  it 's about americans getting back to sweden to find their swedish family . 
  it 's covers a lot of swedish culture ( even if it 's quite `` light '' and mostly entertainment ) . 
  as they speak english in it a lot you can probably watch it without subtitles . 
  yeah , that 's nice but the problem is that most swedish-americans left sweden in 1850-1920 , and has `` mentally stuck '' with that picture of sweden . 
  these horses are mostly for tourist , and they got famous when promoted during the world expo in new york to be `` typical swedish '' . 
  i am not trying to deny your swedishness , but in modern sweden you would be proud over things like equality and tolerance . 
  i saw lena endre in stockholm a few weeks ago . 
  haha . 
  the only big swedish diaspora is in america , where about 1 million swedes emigrated . 
  however , all of them have assimilated and have basically nothing in common with sweden except their last names . 
  it is nice to see some american [ celebrities ] ( http://www.apnatimepass.com/emma-stone-hd-wallpapers-30.jpg ) have [ kept ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/julia_roberts_2011_shankbone_3.jpg ) their [ good ] ( http://images.desimartini.com/media/uploads/jake.jpg ) looking swedish genes at least . 
  i found the map on [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_enlargement_of_the_european_union#post-accession_access_to_free_movement_in_other_eu_member_states ) . 
  the eu countries that now impose restrictions will lift them in 2015 . 
  the reason is ** apple ** . 
  first of all nokia has been doing very bad ( thanks to the iphone ) , and been bought by microsoft , this has probably affected related industries as well . 
  with ipads and what not , paper is not needed as much anymore . 
  this means that the big forest industry in finland is doing badly . 
  poor hungary ... to have to live in copenhagen . 
  i remember when i went to a language trip to uk for 3 weeks - torquay to be specific . 
  we were about 30 swedish kids ( 13-15 years old ) together and sure some of us were wild . 
  but compared to the italian or spanish groups , we seemed very tame and orderly . 
  this is just an anecdote but i think that having parents that do n't have to discipline their children , makes them calmer . 
  we learn from our parents after all . 
  the nordic council and passport union would probably make it so that nordic citizens still can move to norway . 
  there is no legislated minimum wage in norway , it 's decided by the unions ( as in all of the nordic countries ) . 
  i think this will be between oslo and beijing . 
  i doubt ukraine will get it , considering all of the protesting that has happened . 
  krakow does n't have any good slopes , so it 'd be both in slovakia and poland which i doubt will be appreciated . 
  i do n't know anything about kazakhstan , but it seems like they will wait some more until another ex-soviet country gets it . 
  because of the cold all houses are very well insulated . 
  i can walk in t-shirt and shorts inside . 
  * when you meet someone you do n't know you handshake or hug , do n't kiss . 
  * take off your shoes when invited to someones home . 
  * at some official buildings , if there are [ blue plastic protections ] ( http://karibien.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54ee84d1988330133f4e309ac970b-pi ) for shoes , put them on . 
  * if there 's a [ number machine ] ( http://www2.lio.se/upload/bildarkiv/arsredovisning/2002/verksamheten/nummerlapp180.jpg ) in a store , you must take a number before you get served . 
  it 'd be annoying, 
  is this a competition ? 
  no rental units , and it 's super expensive to buy . 
  yes but it will only get you like 25 square meters in the suburbs . 
  housing situation , impossible to get an apartment in stockholm without having to buy an apartment for $ 100k . 
  25 % youth unemployment . 
  schools , we are below average in oced in the latest pisa ranking . 
  you can still buy the regular nogger , not just nogger black . 
  we used to have [ this ] ( http://oddculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/04/nogger_black_02.jpg ) ice cream in sweden . 
  nice , huh ? 
  that 's true , it 's terrible to bike in the rain . 
  but i might have been a bit `` too positive '' about commuting with minus degrees . 
  the worst thing is when the lock and bicycle gear get 's frozen . 
  i have had mornings when i had to bike in the first gear to uni because it was frozen , so i have to remember to put it into the right gear the day before . 
  i have been commuting by bike ( only 3km though ) when it 's -10 c with lots of snow . 
  if you 're used to cold weather it 's not difficult . 
  oh , that 's a great idea . 
  makes me want to move to hamburg . 
  in stockholm they banned cars in almost the whole inner-city when obama visited for one day , and it was fantastic . 
  the streets really came to life when you could sit outside and eat by the `` main roads '' . 
  at least it makes you feel smarter . 
  \uff3c \uff08 \uff0d \uff0d \uff09 \uff0f it 's like those graduate speeches : i 'd like to thank the internet , google , wikipedia , and copy & paste coffee and energy drinks should be somewhere in there too ... 
  americans seem to think european countries are completely homogenous . 
  they also seem to think that we 're socialists and that every country is super liberal to drugs .

  the local runs with whatever bias will give them the most page-views . 
  it varies from country to country , but asylum seekers generally are n't allowed to work , even if they want to . 
   greater competition is never a benefit said no credible economist ever . 
  french is the language of war for a reason . 
  logic . 
  there 's more to cars than how often you have to service them . 
  i 'd rather hang myself than drive a toyota , no matter how reliable they are . 
   the fellas are n't belgian , some people cross borders from time to time and talk to people unless they are swedes , that just makes it even less likely that it 's the new model . 
  volvo executives and people who 've been on waiting lists for ages are pretty much the only people who have gotten one . 
   well then it probably was the older modell , dunno do n't care perhaps you should n't talk about things you know nothing about then ? 
   but why go with the same modell number/name if the previous one has a questionable reputation ? 
  because it does n't . 
  the old model was one of the best-selling cars volvo have ever made and it was more or less universally praised by the automotive press when it was new . 
  you 'd be able to find two people with bad personal anecdotes about literally any car in the world . 
  to counter yours , i can tell you that 10 years later , my father still considers his xc90 to be the best car that he has ever owned , and he has had * a lot * of cars over the years . 
  jeremy clarkson , who knows a thing or two about cars , * loved * the old model as well , having owned several of them . 
  i highly doubt that your belgian friends have the new xc90 , unless they 're from ghent and actual volvo executives . 
  it only entered full production 6 months ago . 
  that 's the * old * xc90 , which is about 15 years old at this point . 
  the only thing it shares with the new one is the name . 
  your cultural reference game needs some work . 
  you need to get your eyes checked . 
  car buyers in general are nationalistic , though the french sometimes take it to another level , like renault creating multiple largely pointless `` luxury '' cars with no real market aside from french politicians and public servants who do n't want to be seen in foreign cars . 
   are you calling the peugeot 106 and 205 rubbish ? 
  the 205 is 30 years old , the 106 more than 20 , hardly relevant in 2015 . 
  modern french cars are awful . 
  the new xc90 is a better car than anything france has produced in 40 years . 
  not really . 
  they only exist because of a combination of nationalism and the japanese and koreans somehow managing to create cars that are even more bland than the french .

  my point is that if nobody would care enough about energy drinks to try and circumvent the ban , what 's the point of banning them in the first place ? 
  we put age limits on alcohol , cigarettes and gambling because these are addictive and potentially harmful . 
  if the argument is that caffeine is addictive and potentially harmful then the people supposedly addicted to it would logically try to circumvent the ban for their `` fix '' . 
  if they do n't it clearly is n't addictive enough to justify a ban . 
  it 's going to be like gambling or cigarettes , there will always be shopkeepers who do n't bother with id checks . 
  if energy drinks really are a big problem , which sounds like absolute bullshit to me , people will care enough to seek out such shops . 
  if nobody would care , what 's even the point of the ban ? 
  demand sets the prices , not the other way around . 
  i do n't care so much about the healthcare , it 's when it comes to education that the americans * really * get fucked . 
  safety should be a pretty obvious reason . 
   on the other end of the spectrum are carriers like etihad that cost a huge amount of money but have exceptional service . 
  those middle eastern carriers are supposedly bleeding money like crazy too . 
  prestige projects run without any real intention of turning a profit . 
  who does n't love a good bonfire ? 
  that one shady shop owner in each town willing to look the other way will make more money than he used to .

  welcome to consensus culture !, 
   what is the point of this ? 
  i am sure the remaining herero people will appreciate the gesture . 
  those who feel their people has been wronged can have a very long memory , any gesture than lessens their hostility is a good one . 
  azerbaijan and armenia ca n't get drawn into the same group either . 
  in sweden the name glenn is notoriously far more common in gothenburg than anywhere else . 
  rail projects usually take forever . 
  8 years is almost quick compared to some projects . 
   street worker -  social worker that one is quite unfortunate . 
  former olympic marseille manager jos\u00e9 anigo had a quote about the city , `` marseille is a city that eats its children '' .

   was there any british colony which did n't have a bloody civil war when they got independence ? 
  ghana has been relatively peaceful since independence . 
  there have been coups , but no outright civil wars as far as i know .

  reddit is a private entity , free to enforce whatever rules they wish on their website , * their property * . 
  you have as little freedom of speech on reddit as you have in another person 's home . 
  and i am sure reddit ownership thinks long and hard about the benefits and disadvantages when they decide whether to host abusive or racist content or not . 
  in the case of a website on the internet , the only freedoms that exist are whatever freedoms the site owner is willing to grant you . 
  you can complain about how they choose to do things , but complaining about `` freedom of speech '' only shows your ignorance of what freedom of speech actually is . 
  again , freedom of speech does not apply to private entities . 
  there is no `` freedom of speech '' on reddit , there never has been and there never will be . 
  you do n't like that reddit removes certain content ? 
  that 's fine , and a reasonable criticism , but it is n't a freedom of speech issue . 
  absolutely . 
  it would n't be very nice , and i am sure most users would leave because of it , but it would n't be a `` freedom of speech '' issue . 
  not really . 
  as private entities they are fully within their rights to remove anything they feel hurts their sites . 
  they host content , if they remove your content you are free to post it somewhere else , or set up your own site .

  ( i hear unfortunately a lot of the same arguments in sweden . ), 
   may i point out that germany has quite enough experience with unsubstainable inflation , thank you very much ? 
  actually , we would rather get out of the euro project than accept an inflation  5 % . 
  please do , and it will be very interesting to see how well the german industry does when there is n't any poor eurozone countries to keep the value of your currency down . 
   the feta i got in my fridge is from the netherlands . 
  and i guess it made with cows milk !, 
  even in sweden they are selling this bland thing made of cows milk , mostly produced in denmark , that they call feta . 
  try the real one !, 
   we are trying not to pay for other people 's debts and i very much sympathize with that , but you are doing it by taking his job . 
  it 's like you are a taxi driver and the bartender takes your car and says that he will keep it until your debt is paid . 
  if you want greek to be able to pay it 's debts , you ca n't kill it 's economy . 
   versailles was designed to be an act of humiliation and cutting our economy to a level where it would break together , this is exactly how many greeks feel about the situation , and understandably so . 
  if you listen to the rhetoric used in germany , it sounds very much like the lazy and irresponsible greeks must be punished . 
  and the greek economy is very close to breaking down . 
   the austerity measures are designed to be something to help the greek economy it has been known for seventy years that austerity in a slump does n't work . 
  it is just unfortunate that the european leaders conveniently have chosen to forget it . 
  the results is what anyone with the most basic knowledge of economy should have predicted : the more they try to save , the greater the depth becomes in relationship to the gdp . 
   what we make the greeks do at the moment is what we did to ourselves post-2000 you could do it because the economy in peripheral eurozone countries where expanding ( granted with borrowed money ) , which meant that the real wages in those countries increased , and as a consequence the real wages in germany decreased . 
  and it created a huge market for german goods . 
  so why not return the favor ? 
  let european central bank allow for a higher inflation to make it easier for real wages in greeks to go down . 
  let germans increase their consumption so that someone can buy greeks goods ( ok , you just have to start to really like feta cheese ) . 
  or should * everyone * run a trade surplus ? 
  you do n't need basic economics to understand why that does n't work . 
  the point is that the reason that the german strategy worked is that germany existed in an environment where other states consumed and borrowed too much . 
  it impossible to repeat that feat in the current economy , where everyone in europe have decided that they need austerity and the central bank keeps the inflation low . 
  the current plan would have a small chance for greek if greek where the only state that tried to save money . 
  that is n't the case . 
  in other words , your strategy does n't work in the current climate . 
  the situation will not turn around until the politics in europe have changed to something that actually works . 
  the last few years will be seen as lost years for the european economy because of incompetent politicians . 
  i guess that the only people still living there are the descendants of the fifth columnists which were spared . 
  you 'd expect that the germans would have learned anything from their own history before they forced this situation on the greeks . 
  ( not trying to absolve the greek governments from really fucking up the economy in the first place , but the so called solution that have been forced mostly by germany has been a disaster for the greek people . 
  with predictable outcome . ), 
  i do n't know if that is the most important thing , but i agree that it is a good suggestion . 
  it would also force the banks to take more responsibility for their loans , and maybe they would be more reluctant to lead us into a mess like this again . 
   i have to note that student benefits was 3/5 of unemployed/social security benefits , thus the state was saving by putting people to study . 
  and if it is done right ( which you say it was n't in finland ) , you get a better education population that have better jobs and pay higher taxes in the end . 
   in my honest opinion , i think that few generations , those in 30s and 40s in crisis countries are more or less lost . 
  that is a horrible outlook !, 
  i certainly hope that that is n't a widespread view , in particular among european leaders . 
  just giving up on them is like asking them to riot . 
  someone who just turned 40 still have 25 productive years ahead . 
  it is a much better deal for the government to pay someone 3 years of schooling and then let the person pay taxes for 22 than to just pay unemployment benefits for 25 . 
  not to talk about the costs of social problems , drugs , and criminality if you just let people go unemployed . 
  maybe not immediately , but then put them in schools and give them some money while they study . 
  that is more or less what we used to do in sweden , and it has worked out reasonably well . 
  otherwise classical depression type jobs . 
  let them build and improve roads , railroads , bridges , schoolhouses and hospitals . 
  things that we always will have use for . 
  what are the alternatives ? 
  hope that the economy will recover and all these people without enough skills by magic will get skills and jobs if just the governments reduce their deficits enough ? 
  maybe just reducing the unemployment from 25 % ( spain ) is a very good start to get the demand back . 
  that is backwards . 
  the problem is a lack of demand , since ordinary people have very little money to spend . 
  the companies actually have a lot of money that they choose not to invest since they do n't expect to get any return ( since people do n't have money to buy their products ) . 
  in other words , to get the economy going , we need to increase the demand . 
  that is done by spending money where they will help the general economy most . 
  that is by employing the unemployed in infrastructure projects and similar . 
  so , well , in some regards you are of course right . 
  we need to improve the business climate . 
  but that is done by stimulate demand for the companies products . 
  the businesses are n't held back by constricting rules and regulations . 
  i just wish we had a little better climate . 
  in the long run yes . 
  but we have known for something like 70 years that austerity during a depression is disastrous , and this is exactly what we are doing . 
  spain had lower depth than germany , and surplus in the governmental balance before their housing bubble burst . 
  austerity is just making a bad situation worse and keeping the economy depressed by austerity means actually makes it harder to decrease deficit and repay depths . 
  edit : with we , i mean eurozone . 
  sweden is doing quite well . 
  thank you , that was interesting to learn . 
  what would be the legal reasoning for exactly what ? 
  for cancelling the contract ? 
  the cancellation would be the same as any other , depending on the exact wording , including possible damages . 
  to not get into legal technicalities , just assume the state just choose not to extend a contract instead of cancel it . 
  then it might be more or less official that the reason for not extending the contract is the business contact with kkk . 
  i do n't know if the company or kkk can sue the state then for trying to limit their freedom of speech . 
  politicians are still allowed to campaign against things they do n't like . 
  what they are not allowed to do is to use the force of law to limit your freedom of speech ; they ca n't order the police to close the shop and they are not allowed to pass laws that limits your freedom of speech . 
  the can still participate in protest marches against the shop , sign petitions and give speeches . 
  then there are of course gray areas . 
  what if the local government refuses to do business with anyone who does business with you ? 
  let 's say that the state of michigan would cancel a contract with a company that makes hoods for kkk ? 
  no , this is not freedom of speech . 
  freedom of speech only means that the government is n't allowed to suppress your right to speech . 
  freedom of speech does n't protect you from being called an asshole by everyone for what you say . 
  and we must not ignore it . 
  silence would be interpreted as approval . 
  we must loudly protest these scums . 
  otherwise they will think that they have the support of the silent masses . 
  otherwise they will think that `` they only say what everyone thinks '' . 
  we must show them that they are wrong . 
  of course some people complain about the taxes , but personally i do n't mind . 
  we have universal healthcare , free education on all levels , and 450 days of paid parental leave . 
  i think most people think like i do , that we actually get a lot back for the taxes we pay . 
  clearly many people take it like one , and it is not very hard to understand why . 
  i wo n't believe it until i see it . 
  in what way does that make a difference ? 
  i will not speculate in whether you are delusional or a lier , but that is just not true .

nowadays the phrase has taken on a slightly mocking tone as it is used to mock those who seem afraid of russia to the point of paranoia . 
  although lately there has been decidedly less mocking for obvious reasons . 
  then do it . 
  but only when deemed necessary by a medical professional . 
  otherwise we might as well go ahead and remove apendices and give newborns lasik eye surgery at the request of the parents . 
  it 's about equally sensible. ,, 
  not everyone who has something differnt to say is `` phobic '', 
  my interpretation is that people have been reacting to the gradual return to the old police state . 
  for a while there it seemed russia could join the west in civil liberties and such but over the last 3-4 years it has become obvious that this will not happen and that conditions for political free thinkers are becoming worse every day . 
  no wonder people are fleeing in droves . 
  by then they were years out of the market . 
  it might have saved them but it would have been a close call . 
  nokia fell for the classic blunder that eventually gets to all giants one way or another : they thought they were invunerable and could ignore the competitors . 
  someone needs to teach her more words . 
  so he is intent on causing riots then ? 
  first ban food imports then clothes . 
  i heard it was a division along the fight/flight divide . 
  those who reacted immediately and ran for upper decks made it out . 
  those who hesitated for even a minute or went back for anyone died . 
  westernized laws and standard of living ? 
  ( down the road ), 
  i admit it . 
  it was all my fault . 
  no the real problem is that when a movement considers itself above criticism it is vunerable to being taken over by self serving opportunists . 
  identity politics and the race to the bottom of the opression ladder has destroyed every movement that has become infected with it . 
  you know you do n't have to defend them right ? 
  they are not part of the activists and no one with a brain conflates the two groups . 
  we are perfectly able to recognize the good work of feminism and equal rights movements on the one hand and the negative effects of bigoted hypocrits hiding their bigotry under the shield of social justice on the other . 
  you are actually just hampering the efforts of the first group by defending the actions of the second . 
  sometimes it 's just refreshing to laugh at the crazy things people say . 
  tia does frequently feature insane rantings from mra 's , incels and nazis too . 
  it 's not only sjw 's that get the treatment . 
  they are just such easy targets because of the combination of rampant bigotry and absolute selfrighteousness . 
  i think that lensing happens both ways quite frequently . 
  it 's virtually imposible to even hint you may have problems if you are on the wrong side of the fence without being called an mra red piller racist rape apologist . 
  ( obviously exadurating for effect . ), 
  you should have hung around sweden this election cycle ... 
  i thought i was very clear about distinguishing the two groups . 
  i never said they are the whole group and neither does tia . 
  if you pay attention you will find that sub to be full of all the people the sjw 's claim to fight for . 
  you are the one that cant distinguish between the actual social justice activists and the spoiled self centered narciccists that are displayed on tia . 
  i never said they represented the group . 
  i merely said they exist and are a plague on any group they attach themselves to . 
  / u/functionplastic was claiming they do n't exist and are made up by right wingers . 
  so all the things posted in / r/tumblrinaction is made up or imagined then ? 
  also we have our own local living caricatures here who do n't hesitate to use every bigoted trick in the book in the name of social justice . 
  do n't pretend these people do n't exist just because you would rather they did n't . 
  i 'm not talking about the people actually fighting for rights . 
  i have tremendous respect for them . 
  i 'm talking about the people who ride in on their coat tails , who have never experienced oppression but are determined to get all the attention and sympathy at the expense of real victims . 
  claiming they do n't exist and are made up is intellectually dishonest and you know it . 
  no it is very real, 
  so we should just ignore the sexists and racists who hijack movement after movement and turn them into inefectual personality contests under the banner of social justice ? 
  oops !, 
  i thought i was replying to / u/simonask . 
  damn you for having such similar screen names :p, 
  those are the kind of people / r/tumblrinaction makes fun of and shine a spotlight at . 
  they claim to be social justice warriors but in reality they have just found the perfect shield behind which to act out their bigotry . 
  and they have ruined several movements . 
  most prominent of them being the occupy wallstreet movement . 
  basically it started strong as an economic equality movement but soon the sjw 's gained a foot hold and it devolved into identity politics and completely lost it 's effctiveness as the endless squabbling over who was the most opressed and who 's voice was the most important and valid made it imposible to actually achieve anything . 
  currently they are doing the same thing to the transgender movement . 
  have fun with your poverty , lack of education and bad labor market . 
  sounds like fun !, 
  because it looks at other factors too . 
  maybe laws about treatment of homosexuals or transgendered have improved and it was determined to be significant enough to bump you upwards despite the income inequality ? 
  maybe you have more equal distribution of power between sexes ? 
  there are lots of factors that are not purely economical . 
  so we should just ignore the sexists and racists who hijack movement after movement and turn them into inefectual personality contests under the banner of social justice ? 
  there is a distinct difference between social justice activists and social justice warriors . 
  the first group has done trememdous good in this world and has fought long and hard to gain equality for women , gays etc. 
  and are still fighting for other groups still marginalized . 
  social justice warriors ride on the coat tails of the activists , pissing all over their accomplishments and turn back development by driving supporters away . 
  i know . 
  again . 
  how they percieve things does n't change reality . 
  i know . 
  that doesnt change the fact that they are voting for the village idiots . 
  so they vote for the village idiot party ? 
  sounds like a plan . 
  political hunger for power will overpower ideological differences soon enough . 
  in some issues they are almost a parody party . 
  so why not start a new party ? 
  why choose to further a party with roots in the nationalist extremist movement ? 
  i 'm sure if you practice you too can learn to read at a normal pace so you can keep up with those incredibly demanding novels at the bottom of the screen . 
  no way . 
  why would we willingly degrade the quality of our entertainment with dubs when we understand the originals perfectly fine ? 
  why exactly are you trying to convince us that we want to gdegrade the quality of the movies we watch ? 
  i think it 's more that the show could have been `` nerd humor '' but ended up being `` lets laugh at the weird nerds . 
  are n't nerds just so weird ? '', 
  and it reminds a lot of people of growing up being bullied or generally surrounded by that exact sentiment . 
  ah so sitges was the end point ? 
  yeah i ran in to that one in sitges last year . 
  did n't realize it was n't just local th the town . 
  she 's a bit of a broken record at this point is n't she ? 
  mostly for putin though ... if history is anything to go by . 
  um finland shares likr 75 % of its land borders with russia . 
  the only reason he gets away with crimea is because no one wants to start an all out war with russia because of the nukes . 
  it 's interresting that russias nukes are only an asset as long as their use remains a threat only . 
  if he lets a single one fly then it 's over .

  we do n't disagree on this point at all and this was also my comment to him . 
  yeah , the right-wing does propaganda but complaining about it while refusing to see the blatant left-wing propaganda at the same time means nothing if you are not consistent . 
  it 's that the left has the cultural hegemony in basically all western countries , so it 's much easier to find reputable sources who package that propaganda in with a trusted name . 
  but as we have all seen , when it comes to immigration , nobody is entirely rational . 
  when i see the bbc always portraying migrants as young cute girls in pink or only interviewing migrants who are all , mysteriously , doctors or engineers , do you think that doens ' t set off suspicion in my mind ? 
  like , oh i do n't know , maybe the bbc has a slanted perspective too ? 
  because it does , and we all do . 
  so it 's better to be open about that than to pretend that there is this objective coverage out there and everything else is propaganda . 
  that 's false and you know that . 
  exactly . 
  that is the underlying point i was making . 
  defending her will come from conservatives while the `` liberals '' remain silent and enable her blacklisting . 
  so ask yourself , again , what does that tell you about the state of liberalism in western europe in 2015 ? 
  the rightwing propaganda is n't much worse than the leftwing propaganda which portrays all who come as refugees and nobody as an economic migrant . 
  oh , almost every interview i 've read is inevitably from a doctor , an engineer or an architect . 
  either that , or it 's a young cute girl . 
  no , certainly no agenda there !, 
  think critically for once . 
  it 's amazing to me that if you are `` conservative '' in most of western europe in 2015 you are in effect defending * liberalism * from fundamentalists and their `` liberal '' enablers . 
  if that is what is conservatism today , then what does that tell you about the european left ? 
  completely spineless and useless . 
  yeah , it 's a pathetic drop in support . 
  come back when her support is cut in half . 
   anti-immigrant sentiment may be prompting some migrants to leave finland the article is n't really sourcing that statement , it 's just speculating . 
  as for the part with sweden having more immigrant communities and therefore being more attractive , sure , but that doens ' t change the fact that these people are n't in dire need of protection . 
  if they were really desperate , they 'd stay in finland . 
  and they are not . 
  they are economic migrants . 
  nice try , though . 
   if there 's any muhammed who would fit well in finland , it 'd be one whose first thought upon entering finland is `` where can i get drunk ? '', 
  muslim men often lead `` sinful '' / secular lives . 
  people often mistake secular habits for secular values . 
  big mistake . 
  i 've met tons of them here in sweden who drink , do n't pray and some even do drugs . 
  still do n't prevent many of them from marrying imported wives from the middle east and harassing women who wear skirts of ` asking for it ' . 
  i 've even talked to quite a few who will defend rape to my face . 
  if you want to know the true liberalism of a community , * always * look at the girls . 
  looking at men often tells you nothing . 
  i 've seen many muslim guys basically dress like westerners but with a burqa-clad girlfriend standing close to them . 
  you are often not able to decipher a man 's fundamentalism from his clothes or his habits . 
  again , look at the boundaries for the women of the community to get a much better sense of where they stand . 
   not to mention that japan and south korea are so far away have you ever been to bradford or east london ? 
  there are plenty of pakistanis and bangladeshis in those places . 
  most of those people intially came in the 60s and 70s . 
  this was a time when air travel was expensive . 
  do you think it 's closer to the uk than to japan from bangladesh ? 
  now think of just how cheap it is to travel in this day and age compared to back then . 
  distance is n't an issue in our world . 
   if you ca n't understand that they should be able to refuse them then it 's your own fault . 
  you 're being obtuse again . 
  i 'm * not * saying that they take them in . 
  i 'm saying that the issue here is the * social expectation * that europe should be the social service of the world , and only europe . 
  this social expectation goes * far * beyond the border of europe , to the point when the refugee czar of the un names only europe as responsible for dealing with the migrant crisis but ignores everyone else . 
  that is and remains the issue and an issue you 're pathologically avoiding . 
  that there are plenty of stupid white people who agree with him does n't detract from this , it merely strengthens the urgency of destroying this unspoken cultural assumption . 
  as a swede it hurts to take the side of our western neighbour in this but [ norway has already decided ] ( http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1099324_norways-goal-all-new-cars-will-be-electric-by-2025-to-cut-carbon ) that it will be selling * only * evs by 2025 . 
  sweden has not taken such a step . 
  i bring this up because the most difficult part in developed western socities to decarbonise is the transportation sector . 
  it takes an average of 20 years to change the entire vehicle fleet . 
  so even if norway 's aggressive goal is implemented they wo n't phase out all gasoline cars until 2045 . 
  sweden has n't even begun mentioning this . 
  and until they make concrete efforts to massively push evs , i 'm going to take all this `` fossil-free nation '' talk a bit . . skeptically . 
  the un is a joke of an institution . 
  they have no teeth on anything . 
  look at how crestfallen they have been on syria . 
  china/russia/india / us wo n't give 2 shits what the un thinks . 
  sadly , meek europe just might . 
  we 've always been overinfatuated with the u.n. 
  but even if europe and possibly latin america goes along , the rest of the world wo n't . 
  at this stage i 'm tempted to say , you risk becomming an irrelevant discussion club until i realised . . that 's what you already are . 
   this `` double standard '' does n't really exist . 
  oh really ? 
  so tell me , is the un agency a subdivision of europe or of the world ? 
  because last time i checked , the un is supposed to represent the world . 
  yet their refugee chair only singles out europe . 
  does n't even mention rich arab oil states . 
  only europe . 
  are you purposefully being obtuse ? 
   not only that but japan and south korea are sovereign nations and have to ability to decide whether they want to take in migrants or not . 
  so are european countries . 
  finland has been part of the eu for a long time and decided to take in very few asylum seekers up until recently . 
  also , eu = / = europe . 
  many countries in europe are not part of the eu and the un refugee czar does n't make that distinction . 
   you 're probably just upset that east asian countries have their priorities straight while european nations do n't . 
  this expectation goes far beyond europe 's borders . 
  again you 're being obtuse . 
  the issue is n't what priorities east asian countries have . 
  the issue is the expectation that europe must solve the world 's problems . 
  why is europe obligated to be the social service of the third world ? 
  this is the basic question that is unanswered . 
  japan and korea and the rest of east asia do n't take any asylum seekers at all . 
  oh and inb4 `` yes but their culture do n't allow them '' , well europe was very homogenous in the 50s and 60s . 
  did n't stop people pushing 3rd world immigration anyway . 
  or take eastern europe today . 
  there is this persistent double standard , europe and the rest of the world . 
  it 's not going to last . 
  good questions . 
  does anyone know if the spanish government can block catalonia if a clear majority votes for independence ? 
  i recall reading that rajoy made clear that he woud n't allow any independence to go ahead even if there was a yes vote . 
  how much of that is just bluster and how much of that is grounded in a reality in terms of real power ?

  because they wish to live in our nation perhaps ? 
  why is that so difficult to wrap your head around ? 
  now , they harm society by making parallel society . 
  i think we have been past that , if not then feel free to read up on what parallel societies actually does to the entire society . 
  no data , just as expected . 
  do you have evidence on how parallel societies are formed ? 
  and the socio-economic reasons behind it ? 
  `` they do this '' is a crap argument , look into the reasoning why this happens . 
  poverty seems to be one likely factor . 
  unemployment another . 
   i do n't view that as some kind of quality . 
  it 's merely part of your duty . 
  this is the `` duty '' . 
  and learning the language . 
  by having a job it benefits the nation by tax . 
  the immigrant helps society even more if this a job which need more people but there are n't enough danes to take the job ( or willing ) . 
   no it is not . 
  that is the crazy multiculturalist view of assimilation , and it is plainly wrong . 
  it is fearmongering , nothing else . 
  you are wrong . 
  assimilation is when a person drops his or her own culture in favor of the native one . 
  if anyone is fearmongering then it is you . 
  i do n't care what religious beliefs other people have . 
  as long as they follow the law and contribute to society i do n't care . 
  you are obsessed with parallel societies and are scared that immigrants will decrease the stability of denmark . 
   no it is not , actually . 
  integration is a haphazard attempt at assimilation while panicky trying to deny that it is assimilation , because people are so afraid of seeming xenophobic . 
  oh no , he wants to guard the border - he must be a nazi . 
  that is the kind of idiots that pushed us into this very poor excuse of assimilation we got right now . 
  they have turned the notion of assimilation in this extreme notion as some form of concentration camp where you drill people with propaganda and put a chip in their brain - which is of course preposterous . 
  assimilation is the process of incorporating something wholly into society . 
  to bring about conformity . 
  assimilation is to drop one own 's culture in favor of the native one . 
  this is not required . 
  as long as the person functions in society like any other person there is no problem . 
  i did n't call you a nazi , i doubt that you heil in your freetime . 
  however from what you 've told me you seem to be some kind of fascist because of your authoritarian view of society and that culture is the most important thing by far when it comes to integration . 
  you seem to be completely against freedom and think that your way is the only way . 
  why do you have so much faith in your government ? 
   i 'm not scared , but if you want to stay my house , you play by our rules and conform to our standards . 
  why should we freely let people walk into our house and destroy everything ? 
  try to change our rules ? 
  to essentially squat on our living space ? 
  your standards are freedom of religion and freedom of speech . 
  it 's in your constitution . 
  if anyone is altering your laws then it is danish politicians . 
  you are scared . 
  if you were n't then you 'd never have this opinion . 
   i do n't know , where is his citizenship ? 
  born in the uk . 
  do you think his citizenship should be stripped off him ? 
  that 's just absurd . 
  he is contributing a lot more to society than many other people in the uk . 
  if you think people like him are some kind if threat then you are scared and paranoid . 
   you assume i am pro freedom of religion - i am not . 
  i believe a stricter control over superstition would be good , that way you can ensure that it benefits society and direct the crazy in more benign directions . 
  i assumed that everybody in this subreddit was for religious freedom . 
  i guess i made an ass of myself ( ass u me ) . 
  we clearly disagree on this question . 
  i do n't believe the state should care what religion its citizens and inhabitants follow . 
  the state should interfere with my life as little as possible . 
  i want to have the right to convert to any religion i want , even if it is not my intention . 
  why should the government decide what is right or wrong ? 
  what if it disagrees with a value the majority of the danes have ? 
  are you going to be spoonfed what your government is telling you ? 
  the government should organize society , not tell me what to think . 
   it is not a danish value . 
  we have a state religion . 
  just cause there is an official religion does n't mean that there is freedom of religion . 
  it 's in the constitution \u00a7 67 . 
  you should know that your country has freedom of religion . 
  you must be undanish to be against it . 
  you should be embarrassed by making such an absurd claim . 
   which is assimilation . 
  this is integration . 
   there are nazis and communists in denmark too , does not mean they go and bomb embassies or go nuts because of a drawing . 
  they 're pretty chill actually . 
  it 's the anarchists you want to look out for . 
  i do n't know the situation in denmark . 
  in sweden communists and the far-right try to clash with each other . 
  i have n't heard of any violent anarchists here . 
  the muslims i know thought those drawings were insulting and of bad taste , then they stopped caring and pitied the person who drew them because of his ignorance . 
  not all muslims are violent like you seem to believe . 
   no , but frankly other believers enable their extremist fellows . 
  that aside , then a believer is far more likely to be turned into a fanatic . 
  and yes that is exactly how it happens . 
  ignorance leads to extremism . 
  intolerance leads to extremism . 
  fanatics exist everywhere . 
  it 's more likely that a left wing person turns into a communist than centrist or liberal . 
  it 's more likely a nationalist becomes violent because of his intolerance to different people . 
   the two are intertwined however . 
  when you ask why french and no persian , should i not answer you why when there are very obvious reasons for it being so ? 
  i 'm not saying their love is n't all kinds of real and frankly i do n't much care . 
  what is important is that comparatively speaking then iranian and danish are very different and it would be best both for the so and society to assimilate if he/she is to live here . 
  compared to someone who is french there is a smaller gap in differences to close . 
  languages are closer for one , and so are the social and justice system . 
  even our way of thinking is closer . 
  it 's because danish/french and iranian lies in two different cultural spheres . 
  in this case cultural differences do n't really matter .

  if you think european far-right / `` national conservatism '' is your friend , then sorry , but you 're fooling yourself . 
  the only reason they keep anti-semitism behind closed doors is because the number of jews in sweden is around 20.000 and shrinking . 
  right , my bad . 
  my point still stands , you have given me no sources for your statements , so i 'll just assume that i won that one . 
  i 'm going to end this conversation before you accuse me of being an albanian or some other ethnic group you do n't like . 
  since that seems to be all you have left . 
  accusing me of being a turk is n't going to work here . 
  you are literally making shit up . 
  first you say that you ca n't have a factual opinion on anything that happened more than 50 years ago :  what happened in ottoman empire was a long time ago and it is properly analysed and documented by historians . 
  there is a reason why you do not learn less than 50 years in the past , in school . 
  because it 's hard to have a objective historian on anything which happened in less than 50 years ago . 
  then literally immediately followed by a made up factual statement :  ottomans actively forced people into islam . 
  too bad that you are n't , as an individual , capable of having a factual conversation without making shit up . 
  clearly to be expected from someone who fails to see the irony in a serb talking of `` immigrants being hard to integrate . '', 
  we are done , do n't reply to me anymore . 
  the only thing you have left is to look at my profile history and cry over it . 
   depends on your understanding of nationality . 
  you see , there are two meanings of the nationality . 
  a german and a french one . 
  the french one is what americans use . 
  anyone can be whatever nationality they want to be . 
  the german one says that you are the nationality you father was . 
  i imagine the french one is the standard for most non-fascists . 
   anyway , i agree . 
  these refugees will find more opportunities to work/learn and earn . 
  but i am quite certain that it will be very hard to integrate them into european society . 
  part of that reason is their religion but that 's a very small part . 
  it 's mostly because of the mentality . 
  it 's hard to change mentality . 
  hell , eu just has a joining process so the states candidates could change a lot of bad habbits ( mentalities such as nature protection etc ) so a state and people in it would fit better with other states in eu . 
  only applies to cases of failed assimilation . 
  unfortunately that is a lot of immigrants today ( including most of the balkan immigrants we have ) , but that 's our own fault . 
   bad habbits ( mentalities such as nature protection etc ) wat  if you consider paying for beliving another god , giving your first born and living as a second class citizen not bad , then i agree . 
  it was not bad . 
  i guess that it would be bad if they were being actively killed , right ? 
  sigh ... i consider that tolerable considering the historical context . 
  also , fairly sure abrahamic religions believe in the same god . 
   what happened in ottoman empire was a long time ago and it is properly analysed and documented by historians . 
  there is a reason why you do not learn less than 50 years in the past , in school . 
  because it 's hard to have a objective historian on anything which happened in less than 50 years ago . 
  ottomans actively forced people into islam . 
  so when the facts does n't suit you , change ( or muddle ) the facts !, 
  anything else ? 
  it 's well established that they are culturally close to the balkan nations . 
  `` totally alien '' is the funniest lie i 've seen today . 
  and yes , balkans people are already everywhere in sweden , so they will fit in pretty well . 
  okay , so all members of the ethnic group called `` turks '' always force their point of view on others , meaning their race or ethnic group determines their behavior . 
  literally racialism . 
  aaand reported . 
  because there were a couple of rich people does n't really mean there was no force to convert people to islam . 
  there was . 
  starvation , taking your offspring and paying taxes were a hard thing for a regular balkan peasant . 
  by that logic you could argue that there is a force for many africans to move to europe now , since changing nationality will help them overcome starvation etc. 
  it 's true that there were artificial taxation on the christian population , but that was as i said , really tolerant for the time . 
  and it 's really not that bad , i do n't get what sources you are looking at . 
   well , not really . 
  that happened a very long time ago . 
  it 's not hard to be reasonable about that . 
  what i 've seen from serbs and others seems to contradict that view . 
  but i may be wrong . 
   on the other hand , it 's hard to have factual conversation about recent wars in this region with anyone within this region because there is still a lot of hatred , fabricated or unknown facts etc. 
  luckily , our grandsons will sort out the truth . 
  i hope that you will get over your differences . 
  the balkans + turkey is my favorite part of the world . 
  and to a stupid outsider , you guys look way more similar than different . 
  i do n't really know too much about the cyprus issue . 
  i know enough of this subreddit to know that you should never trust it to be unbiased when it comes to muslim countries , though . 
  i think they 've given up on modding this sub . 
  look closer , there were plenty of rich christians in the ottoman empire . 
  still discriminitory , but hardly as extreme as you describe it . 
  can i assume that you are probably biased considering your flair ? 
  did you just get un-brigaded ? 
  looking at your votes on that post ? 
  maybe it 's a counter-brigade ? 
  by the way , you 're getting brigaded . 
  speak for yourself . 
  most people who are so adamant about europe being a `` christian club '' know nothing of turkey , maybe at max been at a tourist resort . 
  spoiler : it 's not a desert full of brown people !, 
   so i found the middle eastern turk in belgium . 
  why did you say it like that ? 
  i mean , you might be right but . 
  i do n't care about karma at this point . 
  i just want to show anyone visiting that not all r/europe users are xenophobic . 
   dude , people barely had anything to eat if they decided to keep their christian faith because of the religious tax and inequality . 
  do you call that `` not forced '' ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christianity_in_the_ottoman_empire you might aswell read up on this . 
  you are exaggerating this immensly . 
  the only reasons `` serbia '' still exists is because of ottoman tolerance , i consider that quite impressive for the time . 
   turks were stopped at hungary , and our country was split into 3 parts , only one of which was under turkish rule . 
  no , they were stopped at vienna by the holy roman empire . 
   do we want you to kiss our asses for it ? 
  of course not , but at least you could stop spitting on us and call us racist and xenophobs at every turn just for protecting our national ( and at the same time eu ) borders . 
  do you seriously doubt that racism and xenophobia is a huge problem in hungary ? 
  you would n't be so quick to put up that wall without it . 
  it 's true that it 's really greece 's problem to begin with though . 
   as long as you 're okay with labeling every philosopher in christendom from seneca to sartre as a `` christian '' philosopher . 
  they are called western philosophers . 
  what do you suggest we replace the word `` islamic '' with ? 
  it 's not an incorrect word and bickering here wo n't redefine it . 
  you didi n't `` save us '' from anyone .

  this is the same violent neonazi movement discussed in this thread : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6gs143/swedish_neonazis_suspected_of_several_bombings_in/, 
  parts of swedish territory are considered highly strategically important by both nato and russia in a conflict between them . 
  sweden is already heavily aligned with nato and russia might want to perform a preventive attack against sweden for that reason as part of a larger campaign in the baltic area . 
  the first and main territory of interest is gotland , a large swedish island in the middle of the baltic sea . 
  place heavy anti air and other weapon systems there and you control most of the airspace of the baltic sea , and will make any nato maneuvering in the area very difficult . 
  similarly , nato also counts on access to airfields in southern sweden , and these proved instrumental in the efforts to retake lost territory in the baltic states in their latest wargame ( where nato generals plan attacks and defense of the baltic states ) . 
  https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/rr1200/rr1253/rand_rr1253.pdf edit : realized my source does not mention gotland , the information cited above is from the swedish royal military academy 's official publication on the possible threat against sweden , where the invasion of gotland as part of a larger campaign against the baltic states is one of three possible scenarios detailed . 
  the source is in swedish , but has a few nice pictures to get somewhat of an idea . 
  this comment might have severely triggered france and the baltic states , among others . 
  in sweden , a lot of the brexit discussion was about how aligned swedish and british policy were , and we lost a more powerful voice for our own interests . 
  and i think europeans are to diverse and proud to ever accept the eu evolving into a federal superstate , although personally i wish for deeper ties on defense , crime , counterterrorism , energy and environmental issues . 
  also europeannationalism , which is literally european 2.0 . 
  is this specific to / r/europe or is this how most/many subs operate ? 
  i 've been wondering how and if subs keep track of borderline users . 
  no , but at the same time it is important that leaders such as merkel and macron make these statements , as they 're bound to carry more weight than if the leaders of sweden and romania did the same thing . 
  and as i said in another response , the eu : s strength is our strength especially when it comes to economy and foreign policy . 
  it 's a term which was used about the united states in opposition to the soviet union during the cold war . 
  now it 's being used as a jab against trump since it seems he 'd prefer to rule like authoritarian leaders such as putin , erdogan , duterte and king al-saud who can get things done without annoying limiting factors such as a functioning justice system , civil rights and a free press . 
   seth rich yeah !, 
  not to mention faking the moon landing , sinking the city of atlantis and hiding their true nature as old testament reading masonic banker lizards !, 
  it 's mostly a joke about how germany and france are way more powerful than most other eu-countries , in the end i realize that their strength is every eu member 's strength , especially when it comes to things like economy and foreign policy . 
  i know she 's been ruling for a long time , just did n't realize exactly * how * long . 
  maybe because i 'm old enough to remember gerhard schr\u00f6der . 
   [ putin brings dogs to meetings with merkel ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/vladimir-putin/12094074/vladimir-putin-denies-setting-his-dog-on-angela-merkel.html ) well , til . 
  also , holy shit , i did n't realize that merkel had been in power for over a decade already !, 
  i , for one , welcome our new german-french overlords as leaders of the free world . 
  it 's great to see european leaders stand tall and united in the face of authoritarian strongmen , whether among our allies or our adversaries . 
  my point was the `` attack '' does n't mean anything in regards to trump 's relation to russia as it obviously barely did any damage to anything . 
  the attack was all about showboating and creating a distraction from the fbi investigation and other embarassments , which the media ate up for a while . 
  '' * the attack makes donald trump look presidential * '' . 
  congratulations , you mildly scorched an empty field . 
   whatabout not relevant for the discussion . 
   if trump is pro-russian for bombing assad that 's not what i said , i said that specific `` attack '' on syria is not proof of trump being anti-russian . 
  you mean the pretty little fireworks display on a cleared airfield , which he warned russia ( and therefore syria ) of in advance , the airfield which was operational a few hours later ? 
  - [ the trump administration warned russia about the u.s. missile attack on syria ] ( http://time.com/4730306/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-russia-missile-attack-bashar-assad/ ) - [ assad shrugs off trump 's strike , uses just-hit airbase to bomb rebels ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/04/07/assad-shrugs-off-trumps-strike-uses-just-hit-airbase-to-bomb-rebels/ ), 
  we also have the word * skadegl\u00e4dje * . 
  guess what it means ? 
  hah , we have the same word , * fackidiot * in swedish !, 
   and the state does n't use violence to stop violent thugs ? 
  as a last resort , yes - in self defense or to defend others in immediate danger . 
  otherwise , no . 
  i 'm not afraid of being beat up or unfairly treated by swedish police , so i respect them as representatives of the state . 
  do you feel like that about georgian police ? 
  say , you get drunk , some assholes provoke you and your friends into a fight and the police show up . 
  would you feel confident knowing you had done nothing wrong and police would calmly deescalate the situation and get an idea of exactly what happened ? 
  or are they more likely to run in , beat up and arrest everyone present ? 
   so then what makes you an ethnic swede if swedes have no cultural identity as you imply . 
  are you just a global citizen at this point ? 
  ethnicity is irrelevant to me , blood does n't determine what person you are . 
  what makes me a swede is the cultural and societal norms that has defined our country for hundreds of years : individualism , personal freedom , sense of duty . 
  in modern sweden , i 'd add democracy and respect for our laws and institutions as a consequence of that . 
  i do n't care about your ethnicity if you work hard , follow the law and do n't try to impose your will on others . 
   this might be new to you , but harsh prison systems are actually a good way of decreasing crime in poor countries . 
  yes , because poor countries generally have poorly functioning governments and legal systems , in which the citizenry lacks faith . 
  but people do n't become criminals because they 're born bad , but because of socioeconomic reasons , having few future prospects , a hard life , abusive homes etc are the roots of crime . 
  the reason sweden has less crime than georgia is n't because we 're ethnically superior to georgians , it 's because we have a rich , stable society which takes care of every citizen , allows them freedom , free education and good prospects of changing their own situation . 
  this also goes for criminals , once they 're out of prison all i hope is they get a job , work , pay taxes , and stay legal . 
  studies show that this happens more in countries with milder punishment , where focus is to reform and not punish because revenge feels good . 
  and as i said , we should * demand * that new immigrants take advantage of these things in our system before they can become citizens and enjoy equal rights . 
   i do n't think pride and aggression for self-defence is stupid it 's not self defense if the state can deal with people in better ways ; in sweden , those erdogan thugs would never have gotten close to the demonstrators , because there would be heavy barricades separating them . 
  no one would respect the state using unnecessary violence , it would only lessen our faith in our government . 
  intelligent people use their brains instead of their fists . 
   i was speaking about punishment of foreigners and non-natives . 
  tolerating them is a weakness the idea that every citizen should be treated 100 % equally is an absolute foundation of democracy . 
  swedish nationalists talk about this like you do , but i feel nothing in common with * many * swedes . 
  i 've grown up with friends from the former yugoslavia , south america , northern africa and other places , and i 've traveled to many places around the world , and in many ways i feel i have more in common with liberal , educated people from bogot\u00e1 or beograd than i have with people from rural sweden 30 minutes away from me . 
   do you know why so many georgian criminals went to europe in mid 2000s ? 
  because we had a massive crackdown on crime and the prison system became much stricter and today georgia has less crime and better recidivism than scandinavia ? 
   i am glad you mentioned breivik . 
  and you really think you showed him who is the boss because now he sits and plays ps2 and still has a what many would consider a comfortable lifestyle ? 
  yes , because he strengthened our faith in democracy and completely failed in making norwegians hate eachother . 
  he wanted to be a warrior and a martyr , but he 's some loser crying over video games for the rest of his life . 
   and you mentioned nurnberg ? 
  was n't it like 12 or 11 people that they executed after the trials ? 
  sure , many of them got executed but the important thing is history will always have a record detailing exactly what and why they committed their crimes . 
  just like breivik . 
   you should n't take shit from a foreigner . 
  a foreigner must be grateful that you took him in and gave him an opportunity , not the other way around . 
  i 'll concede that we 've been too weak in placing demands on immigrants , and our ( speaking about sweden specifically now ) politicians really had no idea of how to integrate and pretended the problem did n't even exist for a long time , which was bad of course . 
  placing demands on new immigrants to learn the language , get a job , enter into job training or get an education and deporting non-citizens who commit crimes is one thing , but the whole mentality that foreigners are less worthy and should be on their knees kissing our feet would only promote disunity and make it even harder to integrate people into our society . 
  this has nothing to do with treatment of people from other countries or cultures , everyone is equal in the face of our law , as it should be in any fair and democratic society . 
  the difference is what you call `` respect '' we see as stupid machismo at best and an abusive state at worst . 
  citizens should have strong rights of protection against violence from the state , which should be used only when absolutely necessary . 
  this makes people trust in the state and the system , and if you do n't believe me all you have to do is compare the criminal situations of the `` weak '' west compared to anywhere else in the world . 
  choose any country in for example the middle east , central asia , south america or wherever you want , where citizens have less rights and the state 's security forces can beat up , torture or even kill citizens with impunity . 
  choose any country that 's `` tough on crime '' and compare their criminal statistics , and more importantly , recidivism - you 'll see that scandinavian countries , where people are treated well and police can not beat you up for no reason are world leaders in that regard . 
  the ultimate example is the terrorist anders behring breivik , who , if you 're unaware , called himself a `` white chrisitian crusader '' who wanted to spark a civil war between pure chrisitian norweigians and evil brown foreigners . 
  he did this by first bombing norway 's government hq , killing 8 and then murdering almost 70 children for belonging to a leftist party which he blamed for immigration . 
  he wanted to die and become a martyr for his cause , but the norweigian police managed to take him alive . 
  did people march in the street , demanding he be executed , tortured and so on ? 
  no , they wanted him to stand trial , just like the nazis at n\u00fcrnberg . 
  the democratic society which he tried to attack and destroy won and we feel pride in that . 
  today , this wannabe warrior and martyr sits in a cell and plays rayman on playstation 2 and complains that he does n't get access to video games for grown-ups , or that they only gave him an old typewriter instead of a computer . 
  you call this weakness , we call this civilization . 
   as far as i 'm concerned , the police should have beat the bodyguards bloody . 
  eh , this is the response of a second-rate dictatorship , like what what they 'd do in turkey . 
  the delegation and the protesters should have been properly separated by barriers so the police could have maintained better control over the situation . 
  under the circumstances they seemed to have done a good job . 
  also , i hate trump as much as any slightly left leaning liberal would , but this is not his fault as [ similar things have happened in the u.s. under obama ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/31/turkish-president-erdogan-washington-dc-brookings ) . 
  [ here 's a brutal video from the event ] ( https://twitter.com/i/videos/tweet/864631567972540417 ) .

  yeah , i ca n't figure out how this is calculated . 
  since the article focuses on new parents , perhaps it only counts the days that parents chose take out immediately after childbirth ? 
  sweden has 480 days leave shared among the parents ( with 90 days reserved for each ) which is clearly also at odds with the numbers in this chart . 
  i believe these days are available until the child turns eight . 
  if part of it is used at a later date perhaps this graph does n't count it ? 
  [ another perspective with a map visualization from npr . 
  ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/babyproject/2011/08/09/139121410/parental-leave-the-swedes-are-the-most-generous ), 
  2 ) this is not strictly true . 
  if you 're talking about france 's law in particular only one person so far seems to have been jailed for this offense ( twice , with two other deniers receiving suspended sentences ) . 
  since you 're writing `` holocaust denial laws '' in plural , it should also be clarified that this is even less true in europe generally . 
  the [ english wikipedia article on the jailed frenchman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vincent_reynouard ) does not mention any additional offenses that might have contributed to this sentencing . 
  here are the jail sentences [ from the prosecutions and convictions section of the wikipedia article on laws against holocaust denial ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laws_against_holocaust_denial#prosecutions_and_convictions ) : 1998 | ** france ** | 6 months ' imprisonment ( suspended ) 1998 | switzerland | 15 months ' imprisonment ( fled switzerland to avoid sentence ) 1998 | switzerland | 12 months ' imprisonment 1999 | ** france ** | 6 months ' imprisonment ( suspended ) 2000 | switzerland | 1 year 's imprisonment 2006 | austria | 3 years ' imprisonment 2006 | germany | 2 1/2 years ' imprisonment 2007 | germany | 5 years ' imprisonment 2007 | ** france ** | 1 year 's imprisonment 2008 | austria | 6 years ' imprisonment 2008 | germany | 3 1/2 years ' imprisonment 2009 | germany | 5 years ' imprisonment 2009 | germany | 9 months ' imprisonment 2013 | hungary | 18-month suspended jail sentence 2015 | ** france ** | 2 years ' imprisonment 2015 | germany | 10 months ' imprisonment ( looking this up i also happened to notice that the lady sentenced in 2015 was just sent to jail again three days ago , sentenced to 11 months imprisonment without parole . 
  ( link to the local deleted since that domain got the comment automatically removed ) ) ( disclaimer : naturally i have no sympathy at all for the views expressed on this list of crazies , and have left out their names intentionally . 
  i 'll stay out of the debate on whether laws are the right way to approach this , since i 'll be busy for the rest of the day . ), 
  with this level of detail on border movements month to month , i was a bit disappointed in not seeing `` free greece '' appearing from early 1943 onward , the partisan liberated parts that held elections and instituted their own parallel government . 
  a good reason for this omission might be lack of clear border data : i tried and failed to find some sort of clear map to complement the video . 
  still , it 's worth a brief mention in relation to this video . 
  wikipedia mentions this only briefly , on the article on [ greek resistance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_resistance#the_establishment_of_.22free_greece.22 ) :  by the late spring of 1943 , the italians were forced to withdraw from several areas . 
  the towns of karditsa , grevena , trikkala , metsovon and others were liberated by july . 
  the axis forces and their collaborators remained in control only of the main towns and the connecting roads , with the interior left to the andartes . 
  this was `` free greece '' , stretching from the ionian sea to the aegean and from the borders of the german zone in macedonia to boeotia , a territory of 30,000 km \u00b2 and 750,000 inhabitants . 
  and in the article on the [ political committee of national liberation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_committee_of_national_liberation ) :  the peea 's authority was significantly reinforced after the establishment of the national council in 1944 . 
  the national council was an assembly elected by secret elections organised by the peea in late april 1944 in both the liberated parts of greece and the still-occupied cities , mainly athens . 
  approximately one million people took part in these elections , which are notable for the fact that for the first time in greece , women were allowed to vote . 
  the reason i was looking for this region is that i 'm in the process of finishing mark mazower 's book `` inside hitler 's greece '' , which contains a long interesting chapter on this aspect of the resistance . 
  he starts this chapter with two paragraphs where he provides some additional geographical signpost , and describes the nature of this territory :  the wehrmacht 's extensive anti-guerrilla sweeps failed to prevent eam/elas tightening its hold over a vast , mountainous area which stretched from the gulf of corinth to the yugoslav border , and from the western slopes of the pindos to greece 's eastern coastline . 
  by the middle of 1944 even much of the peloponnese had become a ` state within a state ' , according to general le suire . 
  the germans were increasingly confined to the towns and the main roads between them , and only left the security of their garrisons in armed convoys . 
  stevens , a british soe officer , went so far as to say that ` greece today forms two separate countries , occupied and unoccupied . ', 
  passes were necessary for strangers entering guerrilla-controlled areas , though the precise boundaries with axis-held territory were indeterminate and shifting , marked by blackened houses and burnt fields . 
   inside ` free greece ' eam/elas held sway , with rival bands and organisations like edes challenging its authority only in a few peripheral areas . 
  it organised economic activity , reshaped the judicial and educational system , and introduced social reforms for women . 
  eam officials handled relief for the victims of axis raids and for guerrillas ' dependants ; they brought in a new system of local self-government , and even held national elections in march 1944 . 
  the experience of ` free greece ' , in other words , involved something reaching far beyond provisional military control by the guerrillas ; eam/elas wanted to bring into being a new type of local and national administration . 
  not really , i 'm assuming that your disconnect would be greater if people with any one of your basic attributes seemed noticeably less welcome in the public media space . 
  i do n't really make any demands here , at all , but i would generally expect a rough approximation . 
  trying to perfectly match the demographics would of course be ridiculous , but that in itself is n't necessarily a reason to avoid making adjustments in programming when more noticeable discrepancies appear . 
  in this case the article states that what bbc wants to ensure `` that women will make up half of its staff by 2020 and the number of black , asian and minority ethnic backgrounds will increase to 15 per cent . '', 
  this sounds like an attempt to match the demographics . 
  i do n't know the numbers , but if blacks make up 3 % , it does n't sound unreasonable to have combined ethnic minorities at 15 % . 
  it 's not about being influential , i think in this case it 's about media having the role of being a representation of , and voice of , society . 
  it 's not that strange that asians are apparently overrepresented at caltech and mit ( as another commenter stated ) . 
  it would be much weirder if you turned on the tv and it too was dominated by asians , and the claim that they were simply more qualified would n't quite cut it . 
  in part because the question of qualification is much less clear , in part because we expect tv to in some way represent the population watching it . 
  to take a step back : if you 're on vacation and turn on the hotel room tv , you expect to get some sort of representation of the country you 're visiting . 
  now , if at this same time the asians had the upper hand in politics and business as well , this tv situation would probably add to the alienation , and it might make people question how these qualification were really judged . 
   i literally ca n't remember the last time i turned on the radio to listen to a programme . 
  this naturally mostly affects those still watching tv . 
  did i just get two separate replies from you ? 
  i did start my comment off stating that affirmative action is problematic , that every instance of it needs to be judged on its own merit , and that i was talking specifically about the situation in a national broadcasting company . 
  my comment does n't relate to quotas on teachers or basketball at all . 
  and i 'm not talking specifically about skin colour , i 'm also talking about gender . 
  these are n't my interests , but those already mentioned here ( `` we want to recast with more women and diversity '' -- that the `` diversity '' was racial was assumed by the article we 're reading ) . 
  as i explained at the end , i do n't even know if it 's the right policy in this case , i just think that it 's to easy to dismiss when you 're already represented , and posed a few questions that should probably be considered first - questions that i believe emphasizes the difference between representation in broad national media and , as in your examples , representation in smaller specific fields where qualifications are much more clear . 
  i 'm uncomfortable with affirmative action in general , but every instance needs to be judged on its own merit , and it 's a tricky question when it comes to a national broadcasting company . 
  assuming from your comment that you are a white male : if in a parallel universe the `` best people for the job '' policy had resulted in a media world populated mostly with women of colour , would you still feel as strongly against a diversity target aiming at strengthening the representation of white males ? 
  would it feel as fair that your taxes funded a bbc equally void of white male representation ? 
  would you still feel as much part of society in this world as you do today ? 
  i have no opinion on what 's going on at bbc specifically ( i know too little about it ) , but saying `` fuck diversity targets '' seems too easy when you 're part of the group that 's already being represented . 
  nope , [ about 5000 of the 167k crossing to greece this year has been from iran . 
  ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=83 ), 
  this is n't about driverless cars though , is it ? 
  as far as i understand it tesla 's `` autopilot '' is just an advanced cruise control system that 's not actually intended to replace the driver . 
   consumer activists have called on the company [ ... ] to disable the autopilot feature until it is updated to detect whether the driver 's hands are on the steering wheel during operation , ** as the company says they ought to be . 
  ** naming your cruise control `` autopilot '' might have been a stupid idea in an age where driverless cars are a thing , but driverless cars seems to be doing much better so far . 
  i do n't really have much insight about the background of these numbers , i just noticed that the wrong unhrc link was being thrown around in this discussion . 
  at the very least , they have the exact same validity as the link you used before has for europe . 
  considering the refugee situation , they are naturally not verified . 
  if they required evidence there would be a significant percentage of unknown/unverified ( since they are refugees and have n't necessarily had the time or opportunity to get their papers in order ) . 
  if you click the `` sources and disclaimer '' link it states `` figures collected in the framework of unhcr 's border activities . '', 
  that said , i would think that the numbers from the un refugee agency are among the most reliable that we have to go on . 
  at the very least , if they are to be challenged it should be with numbers to the contrary . 
  regarding your second point , this is a statistic that i do n't happen to be sitting on . 
  but it 's based on the idea that a country needs to be at full on war for a refugee claim to be valid , which is n't really the case . 
  the other countries here has at least the level of unrest that greece had during the junta , when a lot of greeks were rightfully granted asylum around europe . 
  in this case the link was actually first linked to this thread by a user arguing against arathian , so he could have just taken it at face value . 
  i too am uncomfortable with the direction this sub is heading , but this instance is n't necessarily as bad as it might look . 
  regardless , i hope this discussion can at least continue with correct data now . 
  the correct numbers for greece are to be find [ here ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=83 ) , you 're looking at the numbers for the whole of europe . 
  syria + afghanistan make up 73 % of the greek refugee burden , with 48 % from syria alone . 
  ( ping / u/lgbtlibrarian who might also want to see the correct data ), 
  [ here 's ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=83 ) the data from greece specifically . 
  48 % from syria , 88 % are made up of syria + afghanistan + iraq . 
  considering that we are discussing the refugees on lesbos here , i do n't see the relevance european demographics when we have numbers specific to greece . 
  what exactly is your source on that ? 
  http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=83 this year 48 % has been from syria and 25 % from afghanistan . 
  11 % total from outside of afghanistan and the syria-iraq region . 
  yeah , turkey was definitely the biggest surprise for me as well . 
  in terms of the financial security of the population , it looks almost on par with crisis-torn greece , which i was n't anticipating at all . 
  i originally intended to post this in a comment to the guardian post [ how happy are you with your city ? 
  eu report data -- in pictures ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/52wblr/how_happy_are_you_with_your_city_eu_report_data/ ) , but when i finished i realized that it was now 22 hours old , so it makes more sense to see if it floats as a separate post . 
  this particular question stood out to me as the most pressing , but the scale in the original eurostat maps bothered me . 
  it showed nuance in the 1-13 % range , using three different colors , and then used a single dark blue for the entire 14-36 % range . 
  so i recolored the dots with a separate gradient step for each percentage , and added the numbers for clarity . 
  at the same time i changed the color scheme , since using red for `` good '' made the map much less intuitive for me . 
  the data is the same as the one used in the original map : the percentage of `` always '' answers on the `` proportion of people who had difficulties paying their bills at the end of the month '' questionaire in 2015 . http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/product?code=urb_percep&amp;language=en&amp;mode=view here again is the original map for comparison : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/3/30/proportion_of_people_who_have_difficulties_paying_their_bills_at_the_end_of_the_month%2c_2015_%28%c2%b9%29_%28%25%29_cities16.png, 
  it 's a weirdly spread out gang of languages that seems to follow this pattern of counting the days from the sunday until the weekend changes things up . 
  portugal , greece , a region around southern moldova and southwestern ukraine , georgia , armenia , kazakhstan , and the north ossetia , kalmykia and bashkortostan regions in russia . 
  interestingly , a region around southern armenia and south-western azerbaijan seems to have two second days , taking their tuesday from the other more homogeneous group of day-counters . 
  it 's actually orange , though the red and the orange are very similar on this map .

  these are really quite weird and have plenty of errors , at least for sweden . 
  take the map of `` major cities '' . 
  it includes the tiniest of villages like slussfors , bergn\u00e4sviken , and parkajoki . 
  they have populations of less than 100 . 
  about as far from `` major cities '' as possible . 
  and the map over airports is pretty much useless . 
  it 's way too sparse , it does n't even include landvetter , the second busiest airport in sweden . 
  and the placement of for example lidk\u00f6ping-hovby is way , * way * off . 
  lidk\u00f6ping 's a fair bit north-east of gothenburg , not in malm\u00f6 . 
  all i 've been discussing is that obama was n't awarded the nobel prize for being black . 
  that has nothing to do with the us . 
  it has to do with norwegians and their norwegian values since they 're the ones that award it . 
  i 'm not gon na get into a debate over human labelling , the totally homogeneous scandinavia vs the mighty diverse us , or the significance of things like the one-drop rule . 
  that 's not what i 'm discussing . 
  i 'm talking about obama and nobel . 
   mixed race which is a term i 've never in my life have heard here ...  muslim immigrant background kenya is a christian country if anything . 
  obama sr. was n't a `` muslim immigrant '' , he was a self-proclaimed * christian * from the age of six and later turned atheist ... 
  besides , obama ( jr. ) grew up with his mother and religion is n't stored in the dna . 
   raised partly in indonesia he did indeed for four years . 
  but he does n't even speak indonesian fluently . 
   fetish for the diversity-focused part of the political spectrum maybe in the us , but not here . 
  and that 's my point . 
  it was the * norwegian * , not american , nobel committee awarded the prize . 
  `` scandinavians '' did n't award him jack shit for being `` black '' . 
  no no , i know i 'm generalizing . 
  there are always going to be a few that care about something . 
  and i meant it was n't of significance for the nobel committee . 
   there 's no need to be defensive i 'm not . 
  i 'm just trying to explain the difference between a nobel committee and random activists . 
   but to say race has no significance in scandinavian politics is equally untrue . 
  accusations of racism are nearly as common as in the us . 
  racism as in immigrant/native , sure . 
  not racism as in black/white , skin color is n't of significance . 
  that 's what i meant , the original definition of racism , regarding so called `` human races '' . 
  a few things : 1 . 
  that 's a movement that 's been ridiculed just for being blindly imported from the us without any basis in swedish society . 
  that 's an insignificant fringe movement , not a nobel committee . 
  that 's sweden , not norway . 
  we award all the other nobel prizes , but not the peace prize . 
  that video 's uploaded by feministiskt initiativ , they survive on creating controversy from nothing . 
  other things they 've done includes things like burning 100000 sek in the street , instead of actually putting them to use . 
  obama brought a hope of more humanitarian politics , which was seen as a positive change for the `` world 's leading spokesman '' to spread . 
  of course they 're going to care about someone who says `` now is the time for all of us to take our share of responsibility for a global response to global challenges '' and put the emphasis on a humanitarian world . 
  no , he had n't really made any extraordinary effort , that 's why the decision was questioned and ridiculed . 
  he had made promises and was promoting those ideals . 
  race is n't of any significance at all , none . 
  we do n't care about that as the us does . 
  no , he got it because of * the norwegian nobel committee * . 
  it was questioned and ridiculed here in scandinavia too . 
  and the official reasoning was `` for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples '' ( [ full reasoning here ] ( http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2009/press.html ) ) , which many equated to `` not being gwb '' . 
  it had nothing to do with race whatsoever . 
  it 's a ` saab 29 ' a.k.a. 
  `` flygande tunnan '' ( `` the flying barrel '' ) . 
  do n't know anything about it being the ` greatest of all time ' but it was fast and very agile . 
  it set a few speed records in its day , and was a pretty effective fighter aircraft . 
  also , it looks pretty cute . 
  dude , you 're telling the guy with * scanian * flair to go to malm\u00f6 ... gee , i wonder who knows malm\u00f6 best : the guy who ( based on comment history ) seems to live 10 minutes from malm\u00f6 or you , who i can guarantee with 99 % certainty never has even been there . 
  * perception * of media bias . 
  it 's about how people perceive their country 's media , not how biased the media may or may not be . 
  do you know how confused i was the first time i heard of * boxing day * ? 
  i thought families were beating each other up . 
  i mean , i can understand the sentiment after christmas with the family , but it feels a bit extreme ... 
  the pitch accent you 're talking about is n't really related to the difference between * ide * and * id\u00e9 * , that 's just a matter of stress . 
  but , if you did n't know , most varieties of finland-swedish do n't actually have the pitch accent . 
   though the swedes are sneaky bastards because sometimes they have words that sound the same but mean completely different things most languages have homonyms , mate !, 
  english has plenty too . 
  yeah , i also heard that occasionally in sm\u00e5land growing up . 
  same word really , one 's just different inflections . 
  i just stuck to what was included on the map . 
  sure , we do . 
  but they speak about as easy swedish as there is . 
  it 's very slow , well articulated , and does n't have any difficult words . 
  it 's honestly as easy to understand as standard swedish . 
  it does n't help at all with understanding the more difficult dialects found in finland . 
  true . 
  it probably should 've been included in parentheses as it is for some other countries . 
  dunno if it 's excluded because it 's only ever used for loanwords ( mostly french ) and names , or something like that . 
  but that 's probably also true for some of those other languages that do have stuff in parentheses on the map . 
  yeah , i know . 
  not like we had many channels either , but yeah , we did have two until ' 88 . 
  it 's all about exposure , if you 'd start listening to some swedish show/podcast/whatever a few times a week , you 'd learn to understand it perfectly in no time . 
  the languages are close enough , it is really just a matter of getting used to it . 
  no need to be sorry about not knowing stuff , mate . 
  ca n't blame someone for not knowing , that 'd be silly . 
  they 're dialectal/outdated words , not exactly common knowledge . 
  but now you know for the next time children 's games ' etymology comes up in conversation !, 
  no no , it 's just what some people i 've talked to thought i said when i said `` kyrkog\u00e5rden '' in my dialect . 
  if you feel up for making the map you can find data from 6000 people [ here ] ( http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=411&amp;artikel=770178 ) . 
  but `` mula '' is the most common in almost all regions , from lappland to sk\u00e5ne . 
  not true , they 're all dialectal and/or archaic . 
  `` pj\u00e4tt '' and `` kull '' both comes from dialectal words for `` light punch '' . 
  `` datten/tatten '' comes from the old dialectal `` datt '' meaning `` thrust '' . 
  `` tagen/tafatt/tage ... '' comes from the expression `` taga fatt '' , meaning `` grab ahold '' or `` catch up '' . 
  `` jaga/jage '' means `` hunt '' . 
  it 's an old dialectal word for a light punch or hit . 
  it was originally only a dialectal name for the game to stockholm , but as anything related to stockholm it 's spread . 
   what is this game called in finnish ? 
  my finnish friends call it `` hippa '' , but i do n't know if that 's ubiquitous, 
  correct , * fennoscandia * would n't include those . 
  and it does include parts of russia .

  i said hello to a stranger on a bus once . 
  28000 or so or maybe 32000, 
  i know right . 
  i live in a small town in western sweden where a 5-room house/apartment was sold for 1 mil sek . 
  thats around 120 000 $ . 
  problem is that people leave the smaller towns for the large cities and then they cant afford anything . 
  well , as a construction worker , i have to say that we build enough apartments . 
  the problem is that they 're so expensive ( like 600.000 $ for a new one in sthlm ) that the young people cant afford them . 
  * northern europe * cheap, 
  an old game called rune . 
  i became top 10 in the world in the 1.01 version of that game . 
  negative of that is that i missed a lot of my early teens . 
  played it from late 2001 to early 2006 . 
  soon it will be the world too . 
  just like how we started the crimean war . 
  do n't worry finland , you have us !, 
  biskopsg\u00e5rden is majority of immigrants . 
  many gangs there too, 
  allemansr\u00e4tten also means that when you reside somewhere you have to care for the place , not cut down trees , pollute and picking up your trash when you leave . 
  gypsies fail at each and every one of those rules, 
  now i know how americans feels . 
  pretty good . 
  well , i once had sex with an ukrainian escort in crete without knowing she was an escort , so i do n't know if that counts . 
  it was brief but it was beautiful . 
  our country is way more extreme in that aspect . 
  apparently sweden will give 220 million sek each year for seven years as well . 
  r\u00f6ven : the ass . 
  also two lakes : lilla runken : the small wank stora runken : the large wank . 
  sweden and ukraine , the old alliance renewed against the russian menace !, 
  sounds about right . 
  sorry guys ! ^ well , ^ not ^ really ^ sorry ^ at ^ all !, 
  i 'd just like to point out that it 's not exactly a new kind of paint . 
  i 've been using that in my work for years . 
  well , maybe it 's new in germany . 
  who get along with now : denmark who we do n't get along with : russia, 
  frustratrion over how ludicrous * other * countries are and why ** our ** country isnt winning ? 
  that 's because he does n't even know what real corruption is . 
  to us , a policeman not giving us a ticket due to speeding is corruption . 
  its on that level . 
  we 're not actually using a 6-hour workday in sweden . 
  unfortunately, 
  implying you did n't help at all with raping and genociding, 
  perhaps they 'll finally create a party that is actually about the environment !, 
  indeed . 
  so tired of all the politics and doomsday news . 
  i much prefer lighthearted stuff like this, 
  my good friend , spaghetti carbonara and spaghetti bolognese with ketchup is amazing . 
  also pizza with ketchup . 
  chicken with ketchup is also underrated . 
  the tomato sauce just makes it dull you should try a pizza with ketchup , cheese , bearnaise sauce , fries and kebab !, 
  and an onion for good measure, 
  it looks like a normal small town family to me honestly, 
  it 's illegal since i guess the cigarette companies bribe the brussels politicians ? 
  idk . 
  ca n't find a good reason for it . 
  much better than cigarettes . 
  my point is that the turks , or ottoman empire was very much european at the time . 
  by the time that map was made the turks had lived and ruled a large part of the balkans, 
  and by the time that map was made , turkey held a lot of european land, 
  i was told that regular swedish people didnt have surnames way back when . 
  so when the men were called upon to serve the country and join the army , it was difficult for the officers to differentiate between 5 different sven 's in the same platoon , so the officers gave them surnames . 
  and when they gave the soldiers nicknames they chose anything they could come up with , usually related to military . 
  so one got the surname sv\u00e4rdh ( sword ) , another skj\u00f6ld ( shield ) and someone got the name of their village ( my surname is like that ) . 
  but my favourite is krig ( war ), 
  myr is a sort of swamp but frang i have no idea . 
  maybe some old word ? 
  the word for flower is blomma, 
  i grew up in the countryside in the west and personally know at least 20 hunters , all have at least 1 gun, 
  the beggars are gypsies from romania/bulgaria , not refugees . 
  most people that are sane knows this . 
  then there 's the leftists . . 
  or old people wasting their pension on them, 
  its not about eating it , its about making nuclear surstr\u00f6mming bombs, 
  or how the author didnt mention the largest amusement park in the north , or the pubs or anything remotely interesting . . 
  you are 100 % correct, 
  13th century - sweden invades and annexes finland , sparkling tensions with novgorod which would be the start of a series of wars that only ended in 1810 , with russia annexing finland from sweden . 
  we do the same in sweden . 
  its probably because we 're on the borders of it, 
  sounds just like sweden lol, 
  the feminazist muslims will finally kill all white men in sweden and usurp control in which russia will invade as to protect the russian minorities there and there will be a full blown war for an hour and the femi-muslims will surrender and flee to france , leaving sweden with only cis-white men . 
  i think that 's the coat of arms of the swedes , the geats , the poles and the lithuanians . 
  historically the swedish royal title for kings was `` king of the swedes and the geats ... '' as the swedes and the geats were initially two tribes ( or countries ) in what is now southern sweden . 
  im not sure op is swedish . 
  you can go there and work in a mine if you wan na earn some pretty good $ $ $, 
   dude a lot cook anon mom anon to ty for the coke . 
   translation : dude go cook , ca n't you see your mom is busy sniffing coke ? 
   did i do well ? 
  it 's pirate tongue, 
  greece and turkey has a very different political standings than turkey and russia or turkey and syria, 
  that happened in sweden as well . 
  expressen , one of the largest tabloids , hired an antifascist organisation to find out the real identities of anonymous anti immigration/racist posters and basically made a 4 page story of their names and faces . 
  normally i dont give a shit about what anyone 's political views or opinions are , but even i admit that that was fucked up . 
  and such things seem to happen in several countries as well . 
  why does greek monks always build their monasteries in pain the ass to get to locations ? 
  to discourage raiders or something ? 
  well , we have flashback which is a mix of 4chan and reddit i suppose . 
  if speaking in loose terms . 
  negro, 
  second and third world tags for european countries are incredibly outdated . 
  both of them are part of the eu as well .

  why not vote no like sweden , denmark to the euro , or no to the eu like norway or switzerland ? 
  it was up to the greeks . 
  all along the way greece have had millions of other options , yet you choose to blame germany . 
  they did n't force you down the corruptions list - greece did . 
  they did n't force you to fake you numbers - greece did . 
  they did n't force you to do anything , take the loans etc - yet you blame everyone but yourself . 
  i think it is sad , tragic and shows that you are completely out of touch with reality . 
  there are a lot of faults with the euro , but your special brand of blaming the germans for everything is seriously only making your enemies , and no , you do not have some sort of truth , you are only denying facts . 
   also the italians did not go to the greek bank during ww2 and ask for a 10 billion $ loan with 0 % interest like the germans did . 
  this is the money greece wants back . 
  and , again , you have * signed an agreement * , which you honestly are mad enough to straight off deny . 
  and , other people in this thread have tore your claims to shreads - read and learn . 
  and the italians invaded greece , ask money from them . 
  to me you seem to signify everything that is wrong with greece . 
  you refuse to accept facts , or blame . 
  everyone else is , but certainly not you or the greeks , in any form . 
   greece is better off out of the eu and making economic pacts with uk/turkey/china / russia . 
  bye , bye , have fun . 
  good luck with not becoming a puppet of those states . 
  they are all known for their democratic and peaceful ways ... ... ... 
   there was no agreement , apart from that it was , and greece signed it . 
   if germany wants greece to `` pay for its debt sins '' then i think greece should aggressively go for these reparations at all costs . 
  i so think you should do that - really . 
  go for it !, 
  and , while your at it , go for the italians as well . 
  it will work out so well for you . 
  i am sure the international community will understand , love and support you . 
  i would remind you that germany have bailed you out with billions of euro that you should then repay immediately , but then you will claim that they have not done that , that the greeks do not want to be in the euro ( despite the polls saying differently ) or some other conspiracy nonsens you can come up with . 
  also , you do not seem to understand that the greeks to a very large degree put themselves in this mess , and no one actually `` owes '' greece anything - you should pick yourself out of this mess . 
  instead , you are sitting blaming germany for things that happend 70 years ago , while millions of taxpayers in europe and the world are contributing money to greece . 
  no wonder greece does n't seem to make any progress if that is the way you attack problems . 
  you are mentioned on the wiki page ... 
  i am on my phone , but i think it was signed inlondon 1957 or something similar . 
  sorry , true , we tend to forget that . 
  of course you are entitled to pay off war reparations in europe , and have your reputation restored as a raping and pillaging lot . 
  no , it is n't . 
  the fact is countries prioritise different , and work different . 
  finland is obviously working well and can afford a big government , just like the dutch can afford more health care than ukraine . 
  greece - they can not afford it . 
  i think your personal views are important because you minimised both the articles and the criticism with your comment . 
  it is as if a french person would minimise a german criticising subsidies for french wine , because `` the german wine is so bad '' . 
  never mind if the criticism was correct , you are not taking it serious and minimising it - same thing you did . 
  and frankly , i do not think the brits are sad they are not in the euro . 
  that is also why i asked you about your views . 
  it gets coverage in sweden to btw , just as a lot of other parties in germany and abroad . 
  if you do not want huge permanent transfers , how do you expect the euro to survive ? 
   germany will leave the euro when hell freezes over , thats that . 
  perhaps , so you mean that most germans are ok with permanent huge transfers to the south , or are you saying that the euro can survive without it ? 
   sure , crises management has to be changed , but merkel proved to be quite flexible . 
   in five years , this crisis will be forgotten , and germany will still be europes powerhouse . 
  so , are you saying that the crises can be solved without changes in treatiies , permanent transfers , banking union , change in the statues of the ecb and debt pooling/debt reduction , or are you saying that it will happen within five years ? 
  if you say yes to the changes , do you think the people should be able to vote ? 
  when is germany and the other countries going to start follow the maastrich treaty , or do you think treaties should be ignored ? 
  do you think the euro is constructed in a good , lasting way ? 
  what ? 
  are you defending torture ? 
  anyway , my argument was that one starts with oneself , in this case a country . 
  do you think that it is wrong ? 
   then we see that finland has a quite bigger government than both greece and portugal . 
  but finland can afford it . 
   i made my somewhat snarky comment because i find it a bit funny that a party that has n't even proven that they can get votes gets mayor coverage in the british press ' they get major coverage in the german press as well . 
  is that because the germans are anti euro ? 
   and i do think that has to do with the love of being anti- $ . 
  perhaps , but as we have discussed further down , the fact is , that when you attack the messanger , you do not actually deal with the underlying issues , or the fact that he might have several points , or even be right . 
  i would for example like for you to answer if you think it is ok to break the maastrich treaty ? 
  do you think the euro can survive without permanent transfers ? 
  do you think the people in germany and other countries should be allowed to vote on these issues ? 
  when ? 
  all in all , do you think his criticism is right or not . 
  we do as well . 
  one has to start somewhere , and you can not ask them to do stuff you are not willing to do yourself . 
  besides , if you have that reasoning , nothing will ever happen , anywhere at any time . 
  `` why do we have to stop with torture , other countries still do it ? '', 
  `` why do we have to stop trying to produce biochemical weapons , other countries might still be at it '' , etc. 
   they are paralyzed by fear . 
  the people are not . 
  they could most certainly ask them to act . 
  also , i think a politician who actually went out a said straight out why it is doomed , etc could be appreciated . 
  however , it does not seem to be the case ( as evident by this board ) . 
   all in all , you are correct on the fact that we know what works for sure , but we 're not totally sure on the bare minimum required to make it work . 
  well , i do not understand why one should aim for the bare minimum at all ? 
  at least we do know that there is no way the euro is even close to that , but that is n't being adressed either - as we both agree upon . 
   until germany 's elections are done with , we 'll only be getting empty rhetoric for sure . 
  afterwards , well , i 'd wager we 'll still getting plenty of vague bickering , but with a higher chance of decisions being made . 
  but , it is n't just up to the germans , which is another thing i have been arguing about . 
  as it is now , every day the maastrich treaty is being violated , as well as the ecb rules , the stability pact rules - etc. 
  to have a working currency union , ( i think both you and i can agree about this ) there needs to if the economies are as different as they are in the ez , huge permanent transfers , pooling of debt/debt reduction , working banking union and more autonomy for the ecb with perhaps slightly different goals . 
  however - that means that the maastrich treaty , currently involving 25 countries needs to be re-written . 
  constitutions needs to be changed . 
  also , for a currency union to work , the huge current democratic deficit needs to be adressed . 
  germany alone can most certainly not change it , and there is a very huge and real chance that countries like finland will say `` fuck it , we are not paying off the south forever '' and break free . 
  also , the negotiation will take years/decades . 
  and , more important than anything else - the people * need * to be able to vote about it . 
  however , no one dares to let the north vote since the people would say no . 
  and , that is a dangerous and undemocratic , and it can not be fixed by german elections . 
  the only thing that can fix that is letting people know what they are in fore , and then vote - in all countries , not just germany . 
  the pro - euro people are not even attempting to adress this issue , it is constatly glossed over . 
  and , that is one of the biggest reason why i actually hope the euro will fail ( although i do not like the personal tragedies that will follow ) . 
  if one is that un-democratic , it is good if one fails . 
  i do not even know it is sad , personally i do not strive for a united states of europe at all .

  the swede goes about his day . 
  ca n't stop living . 
  on a sidenote , i do n't understand these statments like trump and nigel farts make . 
  is it out of concern ? 
  are we used as a racist scapegoat ? 
  is the schadenfreude ? 
  for being 2 of the most influensial countries in the world , prided with their might and power , they sure let everyone else clean up their shit while they laugh . 
  no that 's the greeks . 
  romanians work hard as hell . 
  just too cheap . 
  must have been my mobil acting up . 
  saw the comment but not the account name . 
  i was talking about resources but by all means , be pissy and act like everyone else us stupid but you . 
  while i do think eu is expandable beyond the classic geographical borders of europe , i too do n't think japan would be ready for everything that eu would ask of them . 
  on the other hand , inviting them to eurovison would bea great idea !, 
  it 's great culture exchange and a good first bridge . 
  it would mean that the smaller nations would have a harder time in the competition though . 
  i 'm not sure why people would be negative about this . 
  i think japan if any would be able to be held to eu standard . 
  there 's a few issues still to be talked about when it comes to japanese market practices but i think it would be great for japan to be pulled out of the us market standard . 
  i think it was a crude way of saying , focus what 's at home before going half way around the world . 
  i do agree though . 
  we have more pressing matters like eu stability than some nobody on an island . 
  that 's an un issue . 
  he ... he deleted his account ? 
  the czech are crazy good hockey players . 
  perhaps we left a couple of hockey genes behind ? 
  if it means no vampire in schengen ? 
  why not . 
  sweden is dark most of the day during winter . 
  it 's a paradise for blood drinkers . 
  you hurt norway . 
  only ikea can mend those wounds . 
  we were all the way into prague . 
  for being a peace loving country , we 're quite proud of fucking that city up . 
  we still invade it with party vikings today . 
  swedish relationship with prauge is quite odd . 
  i get the feeling that western turkey would be an excellent member of eu . 
  heck you might even set an example for greece and romania . 
  even as a swede i 'm confused . 
  we usually hurdle under the booth roof . 
  we 're not touching but almost . 
  standing like that is just silly . 
  only downsides . 
  come here , norway . 
  sweden will union with you . 
  you 'll never be backwater to us . 
  only front water . 
  we 've got good universities and exchange programs . 
  quite an attractive country for young people to visit and move to . 
  not supprised at all . 
  dulingo is n't that popular among natives either . 
  there 's lots of state sponsored language courses to go too rather than using an app . 
  the us have been placed in a very unique position after ww2 . 
  russia would have kept pushing if it was n't for the us and uk stopping them at berlin . 
  russia have been the country to set the standard of warfare ever since . 
  invasion of afghanistan , the proxy wars in east asia and more . 
  us have been pushed to play the same game but unlike russia/ussr , the us have claimed a lot about itself and have been held there after . 
  the post 9/11 invasion of the middle east can both be seen as the bush wet dream and one of the few means to go after something we hav n't experienced before , imported terrorism . 
  i do n't think any option were very favorable and the us were put in a very difficult position . 
  so to me , the us started out good but was forced out of their anti-interventionism to finding themselves in a fetish for espionage and war . 
  all because the continued aggression of russia/ussr . 
  thanks for your concern but do n't let nationalism get the best of you . 
  the russian state have up to a lot of shit in sweden among other countries . 
  it 's nothing new . 
  also , inb4 whataboutism usa . 
  yes we know they do things too . 
  same shit , diffrent name . 
  by god the denial and fact swatting . 
  i 'll clairify what tetra tried to say . 
  hinting means russia along with other threats . 
  it may include and not include millitary aggression along with industrial espionage , propaganda campaigns , economic destabilization and more . 
  there is the fact that sweden , the strongest of the nordic nations have been under the thumb of russia for a long long time . 
  we have both land , technology and markets of intrest for the russian state . 
  the article is just confirming that there is movements . 
  they ca n't say what , where or when without blowing intelligence . 
  it sounded norwegian to me . 
  still a very good attempt . 
  give the man a week and a stroke . 
  it will be authentic !, 
  sooo . . eu = everyone living on that nordic welfare ? 
  well boys . 
  leta talk some ground rules !, 
  sounds like you have a messiah complex . 
  scary stuff . 
  i hope there smarter people than you in those mountains . 
  wow those are some really shitty numbers . 
  no wonder the us is mad as hell . 
  i know sweden is n't in nato but for fuck sake . 
  if you 're in such an important organisation , atleast pull the minimum weight . 
  2.0 gdp is exactly what you need to spend . 
  no more but no less . 
  if the us wants to spend all their gdp on , let them but god atleast do your minimum . 
  brexit was also a scam based on false information and racism . 
  sounds like getting bakir of the seat is a goal for eu then . 
  i do n't support religion over states regimens . 
  i mean we 're comparing high standard of living and low standard of livong states . 
  while a pizza could cost 2 euro in some forgotte . 
  eastern european state , it could cost 10 euro in a top western state . 
  cost and earnings often levels out .

  we have had [ open borders and free movement within the nordic countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_passport_union ) since the 50s . 
  so most of swedens borders did n't change at all as far as i know . 
  we have ferries going to other countries , but i 'm too young to remember how it was pre schengen . 
  ( we have ferries to russia , estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , germany , and used to have to england ), 
   the pages for visas and stamps in the passport feature stylised drawings of our largest cities in the same style as the design on the cover [ looks like sim city or something ] ( http://www.jansvenungsson.com/talk_images/norrkoping.jpg ), 
  do n't think we have any text like that , at least i ca n't find it in mine . 
  norway . 
  very high wages , same language , less unemployment . 
  lots of swedes already go there to work . 
  if scandinavia is too obvious . 
  probably france , just because i like the country , no rational reason really , haha . 
  i remember doing online tests about which city in the world would be best for me to live in , and i always got wien . 
  so supposedly austria is nice , but i have n't really been there much except when passing through . 
  i 'm sure germany would work fine as well for me . 
  come to think of it , this is also a list of countries i would like to just travel more to . 
  so maybe if i spend more time there i would n't necessarily feel the same way , who knows . 
  two problems : 1 . 
  getting a stable job 2 . 
  getting some place to live 1 is solved by getting an education which allows you to do work that is needed . 
  uneducated workers are mostly out of luck though . 
  2 is more complicated . 
  especially when paired with 1 . 
  most jobs are in the bigger cities , but the bigger cities have no available housing . 
  so you either stay in your small town with no jobs available or you move to the cities where the jobs are but you do n't have any place to live . 
  we do n't really have problems with low paying jobs or that sort of thing , it 's all about lack of available jobs and housing . 
  and getting an education is n't a problem either , it 's mostly free and the benefits and loans are enough for you to live comfortably , the loans have good rates too so not all that terrible . 
  although the housing problem affects students too , but student housing is a bit easier to get , so if you plan ahead a year or two it should n't be too much of an issue . 
  either way the problems are more structural faults in our system than economical . 
  if you manage to get a stable job you 're perfectly fine . 
  it 's getting to that point that is the hard part . 
  teacher and books taught british english , but we were allowed to use american spelling if we were consistent ( and it was pointed out often where there was differences , so we effectively got taught both ) . 
  teacher did n't care much about accent as long as we did n't pronounce things straight up wrong . 
  most people have slight american ( usually west coast ) accents that they picked up from movies and such . 
  when our invasions are finished , yes . 
  might as well start learning your new language already . 
  that 's just the danes . 
  and you spelled it wrong . 
  i bet they will join willingly if we 're going east . 
  what about them ? 
  got ta return russia to their rightful owners first . 
  denmark and norway can deal with you guys . 
  well , yeah , but that 's not really that bad . 
  invading finland 70 years ago is worse than that . 
  and then the whole cold war thing . 
  ( it 's really all about [ poltava ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_poltava ) ... ), 
  we do . 
  take away our democracy and we are basically just vikings . 
  and then you want us to have guns too ? 
  it 's not gon na end well ... 
  i 'm from blekinge , would n't mind being part of denmark really , but i 'm not sure if it 's really necessary . 
  would be easier with a new kalmar union instead . 
  but a bit more democratic this time , you know . 
  what about blekinge and halland ? 
  there is a bridge you know . 
  \u00d6resund is only about 4km across at it 's narrowest point too . 
  not a direct neighbour , but we share the baltic sea with them . 
  and i really like all our direct neighbours , so could n't choose one from them . 
  i do n't have much contact with russians , had a neighbour who was russian , he was alright , did n't talk much . 
  but anyway , can only really comment on my perception of their state , not the people . 
  it 's fairly obvious why i do n't particularly like them , they are currently swedens only military threat , and have literally threatened us too ( bluffing , but still ) . 
  their current politics is pretty much the polar opposite of swedens current politics too . 
  and the fact that i otherwise have very little contact with them ( unlike all our other neighbours ) makes them by far my least favourite . 
  they do n't look at it much more than that they want to help people . 
  they see syrian refugees having a hard time and think that we should take care of them . 
  and it 's not like our country is unable to take care of them , at least if our politicians got off their asses and did something about the housing situation . 
  it would just be a terrible idea economically to take in many more than we already have . 
  but those people do n't tend to care about the economy , human lives are more important or something like that . 
  that 's the main reason why . 
  extremely varied . 
  peoples attitudes are all over the spectrum , so that question is pretty impossible to answer . 
  and there is n't a majority either way . 
  some people want us to take in more of them , some do n't care , some want to take in no more at all , some want to deport most of the ones we already have . 
  i 'm sure some want to kill them too . 
  we have all sorts . 
  as if any swede would maintain eye contact with a stranger , especially one acting like an idiot . 
  one good thing about us is that we are often relatively adaptive when we visit some other place , we at least try doing things like the natives do it . 
  but yeah , we can have some trouble dealing with certain situations . 
  most apparent whenever we would normally have to queue for something back home , but in a lot of places people just pile on and you have to almost fight your way forward . 
  some bars have it , but it 's not super common . 
  it 's common in schools and such though . 
  you can do most things without any serious consequences , people are too polite/embarrassed to confront strangers about most things . 
  but a few thing that i think makes swedes especially angry compared to most other countries . 
  do n't be very loud , not in public , in a restaurant or anywhere really . 
  we wo n't tell you to shut up , too polite for that i guess , but pretty much everyone will hate you . 
  always leave space for others , and form a queue when appropriate , we ca n't really deal with people not doing that , and will become very frustrated if you do n't , and probably fairly passive aggressive as well . 
  do what 's easiest for everyone , not just for yourself , even if they are all strangers . 
  this applies to public transport for example , if there are empty seat rows , do n't sit right next to a stranger , leave them plenty of space . 
  [ this sometimes creates weird situations like this ] ( https://prettyvibe.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/g2dqgr5.jpg ) , but that 's the way we do things . 
  however , unlike the common stereotype , it 's often okey to talk with strangers , as long as you have something to talk about most people do n't mind at all . 
  and if they do then you 'll probably notice it and you can just stop , it 's not like everyone around you will hate you for it , no big deal , just a bit awkward , but it 's fine . 
  you can probably do that in sweden , people will just pretend you do n't exist and it never happened , would be embarrassing confronting a stranger like that . 
  but we would all secretly think you 're mentally ill or on drugs or something like that . 
   even though we technically are n't an island . 
  we and norway were practically an island for a long time though . 
  but the bridge sort of changed that . 
  about as much as i feel `` human '' . 
  i am a citizen of the eu though , so i guess yes , but not anywhere near like how i feel swedish or scandinavian . 
   how do you think the people around you in your life , at work , on the streets etc. 
  feel about a european identity ? 
  i think most people see it as purely geographic , we are from europe .

got ta keep the danes away somehow, 
  it is de facto a part of russia . 
  what does the hungarian government hope to gain from the proposed internet tax ? 
  apart from money . 
  what did the other 16.6 % vote for ? 
   who do you support in the `` war '' between denmark and sweden and why is it sweden ? 
  good question . 
  just getting a fresh perspective on the survey . 
  rather than just repeating the same ol', 
  imagine this years survey as a reboot of the franchies . 
  it follows much of the logic from the previous surveys . 
  but you should treat it as its own thing . 
  so what questions would you like to see given that ? 
  you know that less than a third of the population votes for the socialdemocrats anymore ?

  ** sweden ** * last sunday an anti-rasism demonstration in the stockholm suburb of k\u00e4rrtorp got interupted by a group called the swedish resistance movement . 
  the demonstration was targeted against them , as they had been increasingly active in the area . 
  several members of the swedish resistance movement got stabbed by members of autonymous far left wing groups that were part of the rally . 
  several more protests were held around sweden in light of the k\u00e4rrtorp protest interuption . 
  and another one will be held in k\u00e4rrtorp tonight .

  pontare may be insane , but i quite like his music . 
  both of his ... native themed songs were way better in swedish though . 
  i think you mean `` big thing '' rather than `` big deal '' .

  the big feminist groups here are of the opinion that prostitution is a form of oppression , especially due to the all-too-common human trafficking cases . 
  the goal is ( usually said to be ) to make sweden a bad market for human trafficking in an attempt to do what we can to stop it . 
  prostitution mostly seems like something with no good way to handle it . 
  the swedish way is n't very good , [ the dutch still have problems ] ( http://amsterdamherald.com/index.php/rss/705-20130219-dutch-politicians-study-swedish-prostitution-laws ) ...

  that 's my favourite thing about all these made-up really long words : it 's always about assistants , instructors or trainees :p, 
  swedish for `` oops '' is `` oj '' . 
  dutch for `` hello '' is `` hoj '' . 
  according to my sister some people thought it was odd that she would say `` hello '' after bumping into them etc. 
  `` nja '' in swedish . 
  we also have [ kr\u00e4ftskivor . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crayfish_party ) both are really just excuses to get drunk on snaps . 
  it 's true though . 
  i know a few english students here who have stopped responding to english in order to force people to speak swedish with them . 
  depending on location . 
  in my hometown we could only choose from german and french , while the next town over also had spanish and italian . 
  a year or two ago there were hardly any , but now they 're everywhere . 
  every grocery and liquor store has one , and none of them speak swedish or even understandable english . 
  never seen anyone give them any money either . 
  because australia is n't part of the ebu . 
  well , you ca n't seem to win anywhere else . 
  more general than that , good pr . 
  you get several hours of showing a few hundred million people how great your country is and how there are totally no human rights violations going on ( in azerbaijans case ) . 
  can confirm , how a lot of people eat it here . 
  even in school we always had ketchup when we had pasta , though ketchup was n't available most other days . 
  we also eat spaghetti with a knife and fork , and hot dogs with macaroni is a pretty common kids meal . 
  if it makes you feel any better , we still complain about the weather constantly . 
  maybe many of those without jobs have left the country ? 
  and both extremes are shitty . 
  i spend all winter tired from the constant dark , and all summer tired from not getting any sleep due to the constant light . 
  it 's maddening having < 1 hour of proper dark during the night . 
  i do n't understand why people care so much , not about the candy or about it being pulled . 
  some people complained and the company stopped producing it . 
  who gives a shit ? 
  there are some no doubt very bored people who complain about these things . 
  [ this candy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xsiv2jc.jpg ) had to change its logo after an adopted asian man wrote to a newspaper about how he felt swedes were racist against him and people on social media made a fuss . 
  the candy `` negerbollar '' ( `` niggerballs '' ) had to change name after people on social media made a fuss . 
  both , as well as these ones , had been around for decades with nobody giving a shit . 
  the vast majority of people still do n't give a shit . 
  people still call negerbollar negerbollar . 
  there are overly sensitive `` think of the children ! '', 
  types everywhere . 
  our sad excuses for newspapers just cater to them more than in most places . 
  pretty impressive that they included nils holgersson , did n't think anyone outside sweden knew about that . 
  it 's not unreasonable to partially do that . 
  i would n't trust someone who has repeatedly said belgium is n't a `` real country '' or is `` made up '' to be the face of my government or involved in foreign affairs . 
  * ** engelbrekt engelbrektsson ** should get a mention i feel . 
  he started a massive rebellion against the then danish king of sweden after he failed to remove a very unpopular tax collector . 
  it lead to the king losing a lot of power and was a leading part of the dissolution of the kalmar union . 
  not as big nowadays but he was a national hero for a long time . 
  they also have to seek approval from the riksdag when they marry and are not allowed to comment on politics . 
  it 's no longer free in sweden ( though probably cheaper than in the uk ) . 
  there are few bachelors taught in english in sweden actually , including technical fields . 
  a fair amount of courses , but i think it would be hard to make a decent bachelors out of them . 
  there 's no way the government would make svt cut all entertainment shows . 
  they dominate the ratings year in , year out .

  could be as a protest against non smoking campaigns as well as against expectations by parents but i have no real idea, 
  oh yeah , definitely . 
  it is much more young women who smoke than young men . 
  no , we need snow , the dark nights without the snow to light it up is always way more depressing, 
  not here yet , thought it was obvious from the pic ... 
  true ... 
  you wo n't make money if you chill ... 
  better not take the chance of missing out on some spilled craft beer ... 
  russia sure does say a lot of things ... 
  you are not really helping ... ( :, 
  eh , it 's not that weird , a lot of poland are far from the sea , inland climate being what it is ... 
  oh , i did n't consider that , that makes it even harder to predict , but does give merit to the concept of leaving in my eyes . 
  humm , yeah , that is true , automation will definitely reduce the impact of higher wages . 
  you also say you will replace current eu imports with much cheaper alternatives from the commonwealth , i have a hard time picturing that it would have a huge impact . 
  i see very few things that could be replaced by reasonable alternatives for much less outside the eu . 
  there will be attempts , yes , some might even go on for more than a year , but over time consumers will demand the same quality as before , businesses will probably take the opportunity to bring back the old products while also increasing the price . 
  on a personal note , i find it a bit weird that your first post was mentioning how companies should pay their employees a good wage , while in this post you are talking about much lower prices of imports from the commonwealth , though i am not blind of the difference between the cost of labor in different countries . 
  to me this sounds just like the eu , only in a different marketplace , jobs will still move abroad , factories will continue to close and only the name of the bad guy will change . 
  i know , i know , no one knows what will happen for certain , but that applies to both sides . 
  while this is all true , please do n't forget that prices will increase , and consumers have gotten used to lower prices due to underpaid workers . 
  prices will increase if wages does , not saying it is wrong , but the wages have to come from somewhere ... 
  that was uncalled for ... 
  it would probably be more like `` why do i see this ? 
  it should be private . 
  i am not going to hire someone from a family who ca n't tell what is appropriate to post on the internet ... '' not saying that it will be like that , but it is a probable scenario , if i were an employer , i would not want to hire someone who might or who 's family members might post something confidential on the internet , it shows a lack of respect and understanding of the outcome of ones actions . 
  they deserve their privacy , and once older should be allowed to choose to share it or not . 
  i know that if i had my pictures from when i was born throughout my childhood till 18 , i 'd be extremely pissed off , and would sue if they were not taken down . 
  so ... just set the dns server address to be 8.8.8.8 and you 'll be fine ? 
  yeah , yeah . 
  i know it is n't as easy as that , also the very idea is horrible , but that is my point , it will not have an impact against the people who have even a small amount of computer knowledge will be able to bypass it . 
  it is costly yet pointless, 
  good , baby pictures might be nice in a private album at home , but they should not be put in the inter-spherical-web-tubes ... 
  you do n't know our pain, 
  please read my reply to my post , i am sorry , i realized i sounded very harsh in my tone , this is not the time for harshness . 
  i do apologize for my thoughtless post . 
  after seeing more pictures of the disaster , i feel i may need to apologize for my earlier post , i sounded too harsh , and i am sorry . 
  i understand op is from italy , and i feel bad for judging him/her choice of words after such a terrible event . 
  staggering ? 
  while everyone involved have my deepest sympathies and best wishes for the future , this footage is hardly staggering , it is emeotional , yes , and does show a different angle , but i expected the camera to tilt up to show the scale . 
  please note i am not blaming the drone pilot , the cam is steady and keeps the rescue workers in shot . 
  do not underestimate the power of jante, 
  your point ? 
  being swedish is not a slur outside of areas full of immigrants , then it can be seen as letting go of your identity while burning bridges with friends and neighbors while trying to fit in a culture who in large consider you to be an immigrant . 
  i am a native swede , the only foreign roots i have as far as i am aware of is my great great grand mother who 's family cam from denmark, 
  i thought they already did ... 
  there were loads of sings about it a few years ago, 
  in sweden you get paid to study ... you can take out loans , but hat is mostly done to either cover living costs , or if you are living at home , to acquire capital to be able to take out a loan for your first apartment,

  for me it seems like a lot of people have become complacent and forgot about the struggle of past generations to have it this good . 
  people are to caught up with shocking photos showing starving children and wounded men and women . 
  is there a problem in the mena region ? 
  yes , absolutely , but having people move from mena to eurpoe will solve nothing . 
  what should we do ? 
  honestly , i do n't have a definite answer . 
  i do believe that in the long run all countries will be better severed by secular governments , but that itself will be difficult to implement . 
  the one this we should do right now , is to focus on education , that is not the full answer , but i believe it is about 60 % the rest is made up of better infrastructure and social services .

  i see you point and agree somewhat , but most users do n't need to access the terminal in normal use . 
  most people do it as it is quicker , but there are excellent guis for most thing in a desktop distro,

  with the windows 10 shit and more games being offered on linux the problem sghould sort it self out , i am not going to call any year `` the year of the linux desktop '' , it will be a gradual shift as more and more games are available .

  yeah , you are correct , the gulf stream is what gives us a lot of the heat we take for granted , if we look on the other side of the atlantic we can also see way colder climates at the same latitude . 
  i still find the swedish summers amazing , especially after the long winters, 
  right now this is the best season in sweden , the winter is far gone , it is middle to late spring , the evening never really get completely dark anymore , it is getting warmer . 
  this is the awesome reward we get after dealing with the winter every year , from only having daylight between 7:30 -08:00 to 16:00 -15:00 to having full daylight from 03:30 -04:00 to 22:00 -22:00 is fantastic , and awesome any every sense on the word, 
  do n't forget that those come due to a severe lack of daylight,

  username checks out ...

  ca n't blame them . 
  this is a thing of the present , not the future , but the problem itself lies within the countries with high emigration rate , emigration is just an indicator of problems . 
  no , you would n't fit in . 
  from your earlier post :  taking in migrants if they 're likely to integrate ( the 60 million neediest americans will do far better than say turks or somalis imo ) no you totally would n't fit in . 
  can only speak for myself . 
  immigrating to sweden was smooth for me , no complaints . 
  but i might not see others ' situations through my own privilege . 
  mainly cs : go . 
  since the time i started being able to define any political opinion of mine , it has n't left the left wing . 
  some thoughts regarding specific policies or subjects evolve/change but it 's nothing extreme . 
  will not make what go away ? 
  i 'm not suggesting any solutions , just answered op 's question . 
  political party airing fear mongering [ adverts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr8sfev8gaw ) where people share their `` opinions '' about the `` increasing number of immigrants '' ( 136 people were present at the time of the advert ) is xenophobic as fuck , mate . 
  and i have n't seen any other type of arguments through the whole thing in the whole country than `` brown terrorists will destroy us '' and `` there 's so many of them everyone will go bankrupt '' ( during 3 years not even 300 people were granted asylum or similar , for the reference ) . 
   people do n't like to be called xenophobic and racist . 
  people do n't like to be marginalized by the people who do n't like being called xenophobic and rasist . 
   what is preventing a common policy on this issue ? 
  xenophobia and racism, 
  not everyone , who wants kids , wants to be pregnant . 
  the world is overpopulated . 
  and `` importing '' a 3 year old foreigner would make them european anyway . 
   that felt wrong . 
  why ? 
  border checks while going by car/train/bus is not uncommon on european borders . 
  i myself have been checked 2:30 after entering germany , they even asked to show the documents of my cats and checked my bag . 
  a guest from the netherlands had also her bags checked on the germany-denmark border . 
  no and in fact a reasonable number of people are opposing the military . 
  i usually drink any accessible `` american '' coffee - big cup of weak coffee , no milk , no sugar . 
  if i 'm in a cafe then i like those sweet coffee drinks with syrups , etc , just with vegan alternative instead of milk . 
  about the `` culture '' of drinking coffee , i doubt it exists ( with regard to how ) . 
  though if i 'm lazy to use the coffee maker then i just drink it with the grounds , i guess this is unusual in sweden . 
  i do n't want kids and i absolutely do n't want to be pregnant under any circumstances . 
  in theory i could imagine myself adopting a kid from some poor land when i 'm like 40 but i 'm not sure is it my actual thought or just some mind trick i do to comfort myself because my current boyfriend of 2 + years maybe wants kids in the future . 
  i live in stockholm , would love to live somewhere in norrbotten ( lule\u00e5 , boden , kiruna would be perfect ) . 
  v\u00e4nsterpartiet - the left party . 
  but i also liked socialdemocrats on facebook . 
  sverigedemokraterna - an extreme right party with nazi origins . 
  it was n't me who downvoted !, 
  i 've never even tried to get a place in gbg or malm\u00f6 , just heard it 's similar as here . 
  i live in northern stockholm too , but that 's just because i do n't have a job in kiruna . 
  they 're as crowded with people as stockholm , apartments are overpriced just like in stockholm but , unlike stockholm , there 's no winter there at all . 
  please note , i just would not like to * live * there , given that i already live in stockholm , but i enjoy visiting these places , 
  how many more questions objectifying women do we need ? 
  edit : nevermind , i just looked at your posting history . 
  see a therapist , man . 
  there 's too many of them to have a general opinion about all , everyone is different . 
  i personally only know 4 and there 's nothing common between them . 
  3 of them are 100 % cool , the 4th mentions his turkish heritage on every possible occasion and has turkey flag as his facebook cover , supports erdogan , is a bit annoying . 
   in america , it 's mostly impossible for most people to become racist nowadays lol . 
  with this logic , sexism should have been vanished millions of years ago . 
  racism exists in sweden but it 's not as socially acceptable as it seems to be in the usa . 
  if you are allowed to have a cat , get one !!, 
  adopt from a pet shelter . 
  cats there are lonely because the volunteers ca n't give enough attention to all and any cat will feel better in its own environment with its own human , even if it seems like little time for you , it is much better for a cat than its current situation . 
  if you still have a bad feeling for the cat , another option is adopting a cat who is more independent ( pet shelter volunteers would surely help you to pick a cat who is like this ) and gets tired of constant company of other cats , often older cats are like that . 
  25m \u00b2 , alone , with a cat , in northern stockholm . 
  i have previously lived alone in 46m \u00b2 and 35m \u00b2 , what i have right now feels a bit cramped . 
  the best part is that it 's easy to clean, 
  yes , after the probation period ( max 6 months ) is over . 
  since you 're just assuming stuff anyway , maybe assume positive things instead . 
  like take into account that recently a gay muslim married a man for the same time , and assume that this will become the norm . 
  or that a swedish muslim non-profit was forced to pay back the money they got from the government for sexist and homophobic propaganda . 
  no , the rights of lgbt wo n't be thrown away anywhere . 
   everyone has their preferences shocking, 
  i do n't know who downvoted you , you are right . 
   your women nobody owns women in scandinavia and such way of thinking that you hold is generally looked down upon , among guys and especially among girls . 
   how insecure are you ? 
  not at all , why should i be ? 
   browneyed blonde i know a norwegian guy who 's like that, 
  please do n't come here . 
   you literally commented on it first . 
  no i did n't . 
  i just pointed out that lithuanians are homophobic , not why . 
   it 's been decreasing for 20 years , it will keep on decreasing tell it to the women who are suffering from it right now , lol . 
  but you give the vibe of denying that * gendered * violence in lithuania exists , so there 's probably no point to further discuss it with you . 
  i 'll just say that introducing a tool that is effective in other countries might be a good idea . 
  i do n't understand at all what are you saying about my points about social inequality , just as i did n't in your previous comment and interpreted it as best as i could . 
  and yes , i did read the new law . 
  and i 'll just remind again that it was pushed by * socialdemocrats * . 
   what does that mean ? 
  the gap between people 's incomes is huge , the amount of poverty is huge  are you ok there in your paradise ? 
  yes i 'm totally ok . 
  but i know multiple people in lithuania who are not and their story would not surprise any lithuanian . 
   when people like you are gon na realise that these things come with time ( ... ) the reasons for that can be anything at all and i was n't commenting on them . 
  my point about common perception still stands . 
   everything is covered by our law as is . 
  that 's what `` laisvos visuomenes institutas '' says too  it is * covered * by the law but clearly additional tools are needed to address the fact that gendered violence statistics in lithuania is excessive  i see the `` shit '' part is a given for you ? 
  nothing is given for me because i do n't live in lithuania . 
  but it does n't matter . 
  caring about race to the bottom of `` attracting foreign investors '' , when social inequality is so huge and employees being abused in lower class jobs is something between an open secret and a norm , is backwards . 
  if you think it 's exaggerated as fuck then you must be one of the people i was referring to because that 's reflected not only as some popular perception but on a systematical level too . 
  or did i somehow miss the civil partnership legalization and istanbul convention 's ratification , and the shit of a labour law that was pushed by `` socialdemocrats '' ( ! ), 
  was just a weird dream ? 
  in sweden it 's pretty common to ask that between people you know but are not close with ( e.g. 
  at work ) . 
  but the exchange does n't have to be : * - how are you ? 
  * * - fine , thanks . 
  you ? 
  * * - i 'm fine too * equally as often it can be of this spirit : * - everything 's good ? 
  * * - not really actually * * - aww what happened ?

  it has taken over every other issue from public consciousness , like we do n't have problems with environmental pollution and immense corporate greed for example . 
  among the worst we 've seen yet . 
  all it 's doing is to make her supporters even more angry and upset , and rally more support for her politics . 
  that 's all there is to it . 
  it 's no so different from leftist media having sob stories about lonely/bored migrant youth , only difference is that they tend to have some integrity in those news sites compared to the right-wing press writing about mass-immigration or far-right underground news sites where witch hunts are created about anyone they assume to be an islamist or etc. 
   im not a supporter of le pen but this seems politically motivated . 
  publishing videos and images of the most brutal and disgusting murders imaginable is * also * clearly politically motivated , and done so to fuel the fire even more that is the current outrage against islamism and muslim extremism in general . 
  she could have used blurred videos and pictures if she wanted to , but just like underground far-right websites that publish everything in the clear , including names , and addressed of supposed criminals just to fuel outrage culture . 
  same is it with militant anti-abortion / `` pro-life '' activists waving signs and banners of dead babies and fetuses only to fuel their own outrage culture , and not giving a shit * where * those images originally came from . 
  it 's all emotional manipulation , which mainstream news media / `` msm '' is already a culprit of like when they published the picture of the dead turkish migrant child ( which was all due to parental neglect and * not * so much due to us evil europeans letting ** children ** die at sea ) . 
  there 's an other picture showing several journalists looking smug and taking pictures of the dead kid ... 
  it 's just a `` scoop '' for them and their papers . 
  but for the most extreme things they usually keep the images and videos blurred , and in sweden we even blur all victims names ( except for tabloid rags such as aftonbladet/expressen ) and public media wo n't even display names until much later . 
  any sensible human being would not display these things just to make people feel infuriated and sick . 
  i read an isis torture-execution of two turkish soldiers on reddit thread , where the user explained in exact detail how much these poor young men suffered in the hands of the most cruel and sadistic people imaginable . 
  it made me feel so upset and angry i ** did not know what to do ** ... and showing live videos of that exact same thing will only make people so angry and emotionally upset that they 'll vote for le pen ** just ** to hopefully ** get rid this from the world ** . 
  or they 're just so cynical that they vote for them just to spite the `` establishment '' politics . 
  all this is doing is increasing tensions between ethnic and religious groups , while letting pro-russian/alt-right politics take over europe and end up making us more like those islamists we hate . 
  instead of us being the total opposite and proving we 're better than them in every single way . 
  murderers and terrorists often are n't `` mentally ill '' but see their actions rational , and acts rational outside of the acts . 
  oddly enough . 
  i want a larger version if possible . 
  like they even care about `` terrorism '' , they just want to get what they want . 
  either it 's that , or severe ignorance . 
  le ` pen believe . 
   it 's highly unlikely that le pen will be able to win in the second round of the elections . 
  everyone said the same about brexit and trump , though . 
  one need to prepare for the worst . 
  on the other hand it 's lucky french elections are n't winner-takes-all, 
  there was n't just an armenian genocide , but also a more local one of assyrians and ... greeks . 
  mooselims . 
  i thought sweden was known for better roads than norway due to eu funding and lack of mountains , and much more flat surfaces . 
  `` islamism is literally neo-nazism !, 
  hitler himself praised islam '' they will eat it up . 
  but it 's more like they ignore they 're being similar to conservative religious and political fanatics in general . 
  i do n't see how this is surprising . 
  of course one has more of a reason to react when something happens closer to you ? 
  we 're flooded with shit happening all around the word to the point we ca n't really care anymore . 
  oh an other bombing against shia pilgrims in iraq ? 
  what can we ever possibly do about that . 
  `` use this number donate a few bucks to x charity . '', 
  people are also much more likely to ** know ** someone if it happens in a western nation . 
  or how the news reports `` no americans are known to have died '' when a disaster happens in other countries . 
  i know a lot of people all around europe and america , but i ca n't say i know really know any from south america , and none from africa or china . 
  trump has been king for just a few months , give it time and i 'm sure there will be more cases of torture , crack down on media and unions , internet censorship and not to say a large-scale deregulation on environmental policies . 
  vodka is sometimes made of grain instead of potato . 
  what revisionism ? 
  stupid american `` grandmas '' might say `` look that proves moslems are nazis !!! '', 
  but that equally means that nazis are very much like ( radical ) muslims . 
  hitler himself admired islam , considering it more `` germanic '' in the traits vs christianity . 
  the islamic conquests in 600-700 ad was likely an other inspiration for invading europe . 
  the nazis funded bosnian and serb muslims , and thought them to hate jews . 
  many also praised hitler for standing up to british/french colonial hegemony , and saw them as saviors . 
  today they are more or less trying to hide that they are for many of the same things as in patriarchal , conservative , traditional religious societies . 
  they still see themselves as superior in a lot of ways but they also want to be more like them . 
  i do n't think trump would even have a presidential pet , that endless bore . 
  no it was napoleon lincoln, 
  not in most of the world ... 
  i seem to remember `` datten '' only somewhat , and it 's in my area . 
  but `` spela kull '' or `` tafatt '' is ** a lot ** more recognizable to me , and i 've been in the dark green/orange stripe area for most of my life . 
  so i 'm not sure about the accuracy of this map . 
  with appropriate sauce and spices , then maybe .

  is n't it more like a shortage of skilled police ? 
  just add more random police droogs would not make things better . 
  and the police are often afraid to deal with people of migrant groups so to not get a `` bad name '' . 
  and the spanish ( ! ), 
  `` racist '' is such a extremely loaded term . 
  just proposing that racial differences exist is sort of racist itself , but that does n't mean it 's necessarily `` bad '' . 
  is n't there just one human race ? 
  but people can and will feel like they are superior to other people with different ethnic groups , hobbies , mental disorders , language , weight , `` iq '' , and so on . 
  possibly not quite as it seems , i 'm not sure where they originate from in context . 
  still weird though, 
  i 'm not sure it 's as dramatic as `` million starving to death '' but it definitely is disproportionate . 
  so little money is needed to help people from starvation and with basic hygiene , and so much is needed to keep people in apartments with all the benefits such as internet connection , tv , school , health care , and so on . 
  i dunno , there was this swedish report where some people said we 'd * earn * `` hundreds of billions of dollars '' with the current immigration system . 
  while the sweden democrats claim we 're * losing * `` hundred of billions of dollars '' . 
  ca n't trust either of them at all . 
  http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/invandringens-vinst-900-miljarder/ either be super duper positive happy , `` sweden stronk !, 
  or yell and rage about `` sweden is the fucking worst , a communist/feminist/islamist hellscape ! '', 
  destroying anything ancient is among the worst crimes one can make . 
  as ancient buildings or ancient trees will last and be enjoyed and learned from by generations . 
  and when it 's lost it 's easy to be lost forever . 
  or [ china banning all coal imports from north korea ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5uuwo8/china_bans_all_coal_imports_from_north_korea/ ) the chinese government , just like putin , are both losing patience with their age-old buffer state allies . 
  north korea is to china as belarus is to russia , both small states ruled by a dynasty ( if it would be possible for lukashenko 's son to take over after him ) and both have a lack of free market capitalism like in old communist states , where the biggest employer is the state by a wide margin . 
  belarus sometimes threatens to get closer to the eu for aid and sanctions lifted . 
  north korea made missile tests only to later ask for aid from the west , by promising to deaccelerate missile/nuclear development . 
  main difference is probably there 's no famines or mass-starvation in belarus , and private enterprise is allowed if you 're able to . 
  spain and czechia is like `` 0.0 whoops '',

  rich people can be refugees for example , which they can not be under your definition . 
  think of rich kambodjans who fled the khmer rogue ( granted , not a lot of them got away ) or chileans who were against pinochet . 
  or , from our own continent , just wealthy jews trying to get out of europe during wwii . 
  certainly refugees , but not fleeing for the economical reason you are citing . 
  ( and yes , i know that the geneva definition of refugee did n't exist until after wwii ) . 
   so what you are saying is , swedish is a much more harsh language , since the children give in much quicker ? 
   \u00c4ran och hj\u00e4ltarnas spr\u00e5k , the language children want to learn . 
  children are naturally curious , they want to imitate , but something , call it sound instinct , is stopping them from learning danish . 
  i have hight hope for the danish children , as long as they can be raised by someone decent , someone swedish perhaps . 
  it depends on your definition of refugees . 
  the vast majority of them are not refugees under the geneva convention , but are seeking a better life . 
  that is certainly understandable , but it does not make you a refugee . 
  if seeking a better life makes you a refugee , well then we are having some refugees in sweden , for example doctors from greece and spain , engineers from portugal etc. 
  swedes are also refugees then , in norway . 
  migration for economical reason is understandable , but it does not give you the status of a refugee . 
  you can read about refuges [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugee ) . 
  yes , i know . 
  it must feel so awkard for a dane realising that their children can actually speak before turning seven , they just choose not to , since it is danish they are forced to speak finally they cave , but those poor innocent children fight the good fight , for as long as they can . 
  that gives me hope for the danish race , one just have to make sure that the poor danish children are raised by someone nobler , someone they prefer to speak to - like swedes for example . 
  ok , but someone do not posts addresses , can one post the name ? 
  i mean , if let 's say anders borg or zlatan raped someone it would be all over the news and they would be identified . 
  ca n't one write the names then of non famous rapists ? 
  when is it ok to stop writing hagamannen and start writing niklas lindgren ? 
  when did he become a public person ? 
  after the sentence in tingsr\u00e4tten ? 
  after expressen/aftonbladet printed his name after the arrest ? 
  how is that rule ? 
  i mean , the names and the decisions are all over the internet . 
  can one only publish names after they have been published in a printed magazine ? 
  what if a very popular blog published them ? 
  blogs are news outlets too . 
  sounds rather soft and feminine in swedish i suppose . 
  names like alice , william , elsa , oskar , hjalmar , ingrid etc are popular right now . 
  trends come and go , right now names from 1900-1920 's are popular . 
  i think in sweden that they are the most common names , not most common names given to newborns . 
  the two most common names given to newborns in 2012 were ** william and alice ** . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.scb.se/pages/pressrelease____347449.aspx ), 
  and if you are nordic or dutch and visit stockholm i recommend the store lakritsroten , that specialises in liquorice . 
  their white chocolate with salty liquorice is divine . 
  ( i also think they have web shop ) . 
  i have never heard about these blasphemous laws . 
  i read the article and i do n't think we have them . 
  even among those who have those laws - does anybody use them ? 
  yes , sounds better than thugness . 
  thanks, 
  scandinavian/nordic for me , but maybe we are to close to count as a different culture . 
   i 'd classify the gd as junta sympathizers first , ah , i never thought of the fact that they could appeal to those who miss the `` good old days '' . 
  thanks, 
  the authors answers how the spain , portugal , greece and italy managed to finance nearly 700 billion euros in capital flight in 2011 . 
  answer is they did n't , the ecb and in the end , other states in the eurozone did , through extending the credit and sharing the risk . 
  in the authors view , that was/is necessary . 
  i just thought it interesting because target 2 hardly ever comes up in the calculations , the risks and the sharing of burdens in the eurozone . 
  it is hardly ever mentioned , outside of economics ( perhaps a bit in germany who is owed over 750 billions i belive ) . 
  however , of course there are risks involved , and costs , in fact , a lot of it . 
  just the gips countries is 2011/2012 got a credit of 700 billions . 
  that is quite a lot . 
  basically , outside of the bailouts , the citizens of the eurozones richer countries have taken on a lot more in debt should something happen , than many of them are aware of . 
  germany for example , is responsible for 27 % of the target2 credit . 
  also , a lot of people is critizising the fact that the ecb treats the credit as equal , no matter the country of origin , thus ignoring the risks involved . 
  i understand that the golden dawn exists and that some greeks vote for them . 
  greece is in a rather desperate situation , and that often leads to idiotic parties like golden dawn . 
  countries in far better shape than greece have had that problem . 
  but , what i do n't get with the golden dawn is the * thugness * for lack of a better word , the openness with hatred and violence . 
  i honestly question their strategy i guess ( not that i am complaining ) . 
  would n't it be better to tone that down just a tad and talk smoothly about stuff like `` greece for the greeks '' , '' in these times we ca n't afford more immigrants who also steal and costs us money '' , `` look , the police and state have abandonded us , vote for us , we will be there for you '' . 
  i mean , be a bit smoother . 
  i guess i am just surprised about the openness with which they use violence and hatred . 
  not that i am complaining really that they are not smooth , just reflecting . 
  i guess many of their supporters are not the sharpest knives in the drawer . 
  it is perhaps a bit of a `` tough '' / too economic read , but i thought it was interesting because it is hardly ever mentioned in the general debate about the target 2 and its credits . 
  not surprising . 
  the climate change is not even , not 2-6 degrees everywhere , evenly spread out all across the globe . 
  it is depending on a lot of stuff , like the topography , water mass etc. 
  and , it is changing faster near the poles as well . 
  it is also affecting the gulf stream ... fun fact . 
  it is one place in the world ( i think it is the only one ) that is getting colder now . 
  it is the north ( east ) atlantic . 
  and that was one home , one company . 
  do you normally dismiss statistics after singular events that concerns a few people , when you measure populations ? 
  have you been to other countries ? 
  what do you think it is like there ? 
  what do you find at fault with the investigation and what does your proposed list looks like then ? 
  statitistically that is one island . 
  swedes grow older than greeks . 
  well , we actually become older than the greeks do so i do n't think that sun and organic food is helping . 
  maybe the cold is preserving us . 
   and heat . 
  it is weird , i hate heat too . 
  i do n't understand people who want to be in the sun at all , if it is hotter than 15 degrees , but i like saunas . 
  i think the trick is a ) nice company b ) going into the water often if you hate it c ) drinking water . 
  also , non of that electric shit - it has to be a proper sauna , heated with wood . 
  electric saunas are to dry . 
  we have the best one at our summer house , seated by sea , so you sit and watch out over the baltic ocean , then you can jump in to the ( very cold baltic ) water . 
  who does n't love saunas ? 
  i did read it . 
  but if the polls says that a majority says yes , it is yes , whether it has been tested or not . 
  i did read , but the point of common taxation ( which is a super big thing ) or the ftt would never have come up had the ez not messed up why again , ca n't you bail out your own banks ? 
  fix your own problems ? 
  go through the proper channels ? 
  you refuse to answer that,

  maybe try to stop doing shitty things and see what happens ? 
  only to learn about . 
  not to make you join . 
  is there no respect for being educated any more ? 
  do n't hold back . 
  tell us how you really feel . 
  yup for a far righter anything left of hard core conservative is communism . 
  ah but you see they were `` leftists '' ( actually more like center moderates ) so they were n't real humans . 
  a guy died in russia recently when a rocket launch set fire to a field that he was driving through . 
  once a wildfire gets started even a car is n't safe . 
  there are no words to describe how deluded you are . 
  history will not be kind to trump . 
  he is a buffoon and a crook and completely incompetent when it comes to leading anything . 
  he ca n't even stop incriminating himself for long enough to pass any meaningful legislation . 
  if you do n't see that then you are either just as incompetent and deluded as he is , or you are actively ignoring it because you are a nihilist that wants to see the world burn . 
  how exactly does me existing make trump a good choice for president ? 
  i have never met him or had any effect on him or you . 
   russia , which is a super power regional power would be closer to the truth . 
  they are trying but they are not up to superpower status yet . 
  my point was that russia likes to look strong but is actually in a much weaker position that they were before wwii . 
  as you say trying something this crazy is not in their plans . 
  mostly because they know they would get pulverized . 
  people see european freedom and lifestyle as a sign of weakness . 
  it 's not . 
  europe is stronger than people expect . 
  we just dont wave our strength around as much as some places . 
  can russia handle losing 20 + million young men again ? 
  that 's what reaching berlin cost them last time . 
  and that was against a lonely germany that was fighting ( and losing ) on at least 3 fronts against basically the rest of europe and the us . 
  and regarding fertility : russia hit 1.25 in 2000 and have been climbing back out ever since . 
  1.7 is only for the last few years . 
  population has been shrinking by on average 0.2 % per year . 
  it has not had a single year of population growth since 1991 . 
  meanwhile the eu countries have had positive growth every single year for decades and is growing on average 0.2 % every year . 
  in the age bracket 15-29 russia only has 16,7 million men and about as many women . 
  if russia goes balls to the wall total war into europe and incur similar losses to the wwii , there will be no millenial generation in russia after that . 
  the demographic effect will be catastrophic and could lead to a complete collapse of the russian state and economy in a decade or so . 
  mostly a catastrophe for russia though as their death rate was way higher . 
  these days russia ca n't just throw bodies at the problem like they did in wwii . 
  their population has been declining while europes has been growing . 
  and being the defender is always easier . 
  germany or the eu is not planning on invading russia . 
  so it 's russia that has to maintain a supply line deep into hostile territory if they decide to make a move while the eu forces are in home country defending , with superior equipment and better supplies . 
  germany has 179000 active frontline personnel . 
  france has 202000 active frontline personnel italy has 320000 active frontline personnel they do n't need active conscription . 
  also the russian military industrial complex is running at it 's peak right now trying to update their old shit equipment . 
  the european weapons industry is just running at normal pace . 
  if europe turns to a war economy russia will be dwarfed so fast their heads will spin . 
  germany , france and italy together are about twice as strong as russia . 
  you overestimate the size and power of the russian military and underestimate the size and power of european militaries . 
  that just tells me you are easily distracted by irrelevant talking points and false statements . 
  you just elected the village idiot for president . 
  you have no standing to criticize . 
  so basically you perception and analysis skills arent that strong then . 
  going through the vatican museum is a very desensitizing process . 
  at first you marvel at the statues and art pieces . 
  you spend lots of time admiring each one . 
  towards the end you you just go : `` oh yay , another room full of damn statues '' . 
  even the caretakers of the museum seems to have given up at that point as the collections become increasingly random and the labels are fewer and fewer . 
  and then at the end you join the loudest museum crowd in the world in the sistine chapel where guards shout every 30 seconds at the top of their lungs that everyone should be silent , while you are being almost forcibly herded towards the exit . 
  [ the antipope you say ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggbhfxpqbgi ), 
  keep telling yourselves that . 
  how about the prison population crisis ? 
  no economy is sustainable if 1 % of the population is in prison at any given time and the ones who get out ca n't get jobs . 
  eventually you will end up with so many unemployable ex-cons that whole areas become lawless because of crime and poverty ... oh wait that already happened . 
  i do n't think even the refugee crisis is the reason . 
  if the refugee crisis happened in a healthy strong economy with low unemployment and good real wages then the populist reaction would n't have been nearly as strong . 
  the fact that it happened on the tail end of a recession is the most important factor . 
  people who feel economic pressure are more likely to feel threatened by outsiders and more willing to listen to populists promising an end to the hard times if only you enact their policies . 
  it makes a certain kind of sense that if you keep out new people then there will be less competition for resources . 
  our brains are too primitive to realize that the scarcity we experience is artificial and that the ones who are actually hogging all the resources are n't the immigrants , but the super rich . 
  populism is promising imposible things to get votes . 
  it happens on both sides of the spectrum and is based on making idiots feel validated and making people think there are easy solutions to complex problems and that all the wrongs in society can be blamed on a specific group or ideology and if you get rid of them then utopia will follow . 
  anyone willing to stop and think for 5 seconds will immediately start finding the flaws , . 
  the populist simply bets on enough people not thinking any deeper than the surface level of his words . 
  `` less taxes bring more prosperity !, 
  '' , `` crime is caused by immigration '' , `` all men are potential rapists '' , `` the eu is telling us how to live '' , `` free healthcare for all and taxbreaks ! '', 
  are all populist statements . 
  every politician dips their toes in the populist stream every once in a while to give themselves a boost . 
  however the true populist goes and stands in the middle of the stream , completely losing touch with the shore of reality and any society that joins him there will be swept down stream and drown if they do n't somehow pull themselves out of it . 
  this was arround even before youtube . 
  look at the watermark . 
  rathergood.com was the source of a lot of early internet animations and pieces . 
  i 'm surprised it 's still around . 
  i 'm not british , but if i was i 'd be asking cameron to kindly shut the hell up . 
  he dragged you guys into this mess with his irresponsible pandering , only to leg it out the back door once the magnitude of his screwup was evident . 
  he should n't get to have any opinion on how his mess ought to be best cleaned up . 
  at 1am with no functional fire alarm they should just be thankful that the death rate was n't 100 % !, 
  incredibly irresponsible of whoever owned the building . 
  could be that the daughter told the mother about the abuse and told her they took pictures ok so it turns out the daughter was 3 . 
  but still . 
  the mother might have been suspicious and decided to have a look for that reason . 
  spain had it more recently than the rest of us ( except maybe greece and portugal ) . 
  people who are now middle aged were born under franco . 
  millennials in spain grew up with parents who lived through the dictatorship . 
  it 's noteworthy that spain is one of the only countries that lacks an influential far right party right now . 
  in sweden we actually use both decimeters and decilitres in daily speak !, 
  so useful !, 
  please describe what you mean by `` vetting '' in this case .

   also having a lot of old architecture is a good way of making a city look like a graveyard . 
  you 've never been to an older city then , eh ? 
  or [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/uppsala_-_view_of_river_and_v%c3%a4stg%c3%b6ta_nation.jpg ) ? 
  that 's older architecture . 
  hundreds of years old , even . 
  [ this ] ( https://cdn.starwebserver.se/shops/sekelskifte/files/cache/storg_torstenssg_dup1_large-1448355457_large.jpg ) is from just a few years before the towers above . 
  that also graveyard-y ? 
  kinda the same in uppsala , sweden , except with the base of the castle instead of the church tower . 
  for the city center at least , got ta preserve [ the skyline ] ( http://beautifuluppsala.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_6548-001.jpg ) . 
  it 's not a confirmed terrorist attack ( yet ) , and there * have * been other attacks in the past . 
  the sword attack in trollh\u00e4ttan and peter mangs shootings in malm\u00f6 were terrorist attacks , for example . 
  hell , we even had some sami terrorists who blew up some power lines in 1998 . 
  hilariously , female pikachu have heart-shaped tails . 
  that 's a boy pikachu . 
  sure , if they 're * wrong * ? 
  not sure how you mean here . 
  if the answers are say aecdebcced and you answer cccccccccc you 'd get 3 points , since there are 3 cs in there . 
  you do n't get -1 point for wrong answers , if that 's what you 're asking . 
  the university program for teachers in sweden is insanely easy to get into , which is a huge problem here ... you can do a `` university test '' with multiple-choice questions that gives a score between 0.0 and 2.0 to use instead of grades to get into university , if you want . 
  last year , you needed a 0.1 to get into the teacher program . 
  you 'd get around 0.4-0 .5 if you simply chose c on every single question of the test . 
  well , it certainly does n't help that the pisa tests comes right after the national tests and have no effect on grades , so swedish students do n't give a shit about scoring well on it . 
  at least they seem to have the same way of calculating for each country here . 
  i remember a few years ago , when our then-opposition claimed that sweden had * the * highest youth unemployment in the entire eu , and someone calmly pointed out we were also the only country in that study who included gymnasium students looking for a summer job in our unemployment statistics . 
  statistics in general can be very misleading if done improperly , or if not understanding the underlying reasons for certain stats . 
  yep , but getting fewer and fewer changes ... getting increasingly stagnant as `` anti-griefers '' prevent any new things from popping up . 
  also lines of dutch and swedish flag hearts in between the dutch area and the massive swedish flag . 
  sweden has never been invaded , yet have a completely different attitude to the whole thing , so i 'm not sure i believe in that argument . 
  my parents have a regular cherry tree ( small-medium amount of white flowers ) and a japanese cherry tree ( large amount of bright pink flowers ) in their garden . 
   we 've been graced by not having a dictator , or hostile invasion control our lives in the past millennium . 
  how would that influence things ? 
  edit : also , the dictator part is n't true . 
  not just based on , but it 's most likely located there as well . 
  impossible to know exactly where though , as there are many contradictions ( probably to ensure it 's impossible to say it 's a single country ) . 
  some place that is n't landlocked , and uses both cyrillic and latin alphabets . 
  signs are in both russian , romanian and bulgarian . 
  the gas pumps on highway 17 are swedish . 
  well they have what * looks * like a japanese cherry tree in the back on the left as well ... 
  gives the illusion of higher protection/regulation than national labels give ? 
   the spelling `` expresso '' is sometimes used ; while some sources state that this spelling is incorrect , other sources call it an acceptable variant spelling . 
  wikipedia says it 's fine sometimes !, 
  ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ not, 
  i think it might depend on how you word the question and how `` tight '' you mean for the union to be ... you have any good poll about it that you could link ? 
  it 's a rather interesting subject . 
  they are not . 
  the liberals have been pro-defense spending as well , for as long as i can remember . 
  certainly since bj\u00f6rklund took over as party leader , almost 10 years ago , at the very least . 
  yep , to sum stuff up : moderate party ( r ) and center party ( r ) = pro nato , but wants strong political support for it before joining ( as in at least one of the left wing parties supporting it ) . 
  christian democrats ( r ) = pro nato , though do not feel strongly about it and were against it until 2013 when they slowly started shifting to being more for it . 
  liberals ( r ) , ( formerly people 's party ) = pro nato , wants sweden to join as quickly as possible . 
  feels it 's a matter of national security that should n't be stopped by political disagreement . 
  social democrats ( l ) , green party ( l ) = anti nato , citing the swedish neutrality and nonalignment policies . 
  left party ( l ) = anti nato , says joining would reduce our ability to conduct foreign policy and peacekeeping missions . 
  also claims that we would be dragged into multiple offensive wars and conflicts if joining . 
  sweden democrats = anti nato , wants more nordic cooperation instead . 
  however , polls show a majority of their voters actually support joining . 
  support for such a union is * very * low in the nordic countries though . 
  highest in sweden actually , possibly because sweden ( stockholm ) would likely become the `` capital '' of such a union , as it 's central and sweden has the highest population and such . 
  the party i vote for ( liberals ) are right wing but fairly close to the center . 
  they used to be more outspoken against certain integration problems and such a few years ago ( for example , one of their suggestions was that religious clothing that covered the face and eyes should not be allowed in schools ) . 
  they pretty much stopped when they were constantly accused of being fascist and racist by media and certain left wing groups , and it started hurting their poll numbers . 
  i think it was mainly this type of rhetoric that led to the sweden democrats gaining so much support initially , and it 's still leading to further polarization of our politics . 
  used to be state owned , now pernod ricard owned since 2008 ( they bought it from the government for 55 billion sek ) . 
  he * mocked them * as they starved . 
  `` did n't want them to die '' my ass . 
  he was just sad ghandi was n't among the corpses . 
  easy there , adolf fredrick . 
  yes , it 's sooo terrible to have become one of the best places to live in the entire world . 
  so bad . 
  different gc area . 
  this particular area is as above , but the rest of the danish gold coast was sold 1850 as you said . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_slave_trade from my understanding , our part in the trade was mainly related to collecting export taxes and selling iron chains . 
  i must admit to not knowing much about it though . 
  battle of breitenfeld . 
  an army from sweden and saxony , led by gustav ii adolf , crushed the slightly smaller imperial army and crippled the catholic league 's ability to field a larger army while multiple smaller german states flocked to the protestant side . 
  the battle confirmed gustav ii adolf 's skill and innovation on the battlefield , turned the war in protestant favor and shifted the power balance in europe . 
  still kinda tame compared to the thirty years war :  the swedish armies alone may have destroyed up to 2,000 castles , 18,000 villages , and 1,500 towns in germany , one-third of all german towns . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwedentrunk of course , the 30yw was quite important for future religious freedom in europe , and sweden turned the tide in favor of the protestants with the battle of breitenfeld 1631 , but still . 
  we were kinda shitty in the 1600s in general . 
  the history of the swedish gold coast is great , by the way : - founded by sweden . 
  - governor is replaced after a few years . 
  pissed off , he defects to denmark and seizes it for them . 
  - sweden uses this to declare war on denmark , as is tradition . 
  - the colony is returned to sweden , but turns out a friend of the guy who handed it to denmark has now * sold * the colony to the dutch west india company and escaped to angola with the money . 
  - the native people lead a successful uprising against the dutch , then offer sweden control of the area again . 
  - denmark seizes the colony * again * , but loses it to britain just a year later . 
  all of this happened within 15 years , between 1649 and 1664 . 
  edit : thanks for the gold ^ ^ ^ ^ coast !, 
  it 's good for practicing and expanding your word count a bit . 
  does n't really teach grammar and such well , tho . 
  many small islands in the area speaks french , so might be why . 
  does n't seem to be trade-related at least . 
  op knows that 's why . 
  he 's a racist t_d poster trying to push a narrative . 
  as for spanish on greenland ... they wan na retire somewhere warm and cozy , maybe ? 
  but if we blow up everything * except * pluto , it 'll finally get to be biggest !, 
  well you got ta have enough to destroy the moon as well , just in case there 's a nazi moonbase like in iron sky or something . 
  or trying to offer separate trade deals to solo eu countries to weaken the union and not have to deal with them together . 
  trump also said on at least two separate occasions that they should * use * nukes more often , because why else would you even have them ? 
  so maybe it 's not * just * to have the most anymore .

  the more people are educated or want to be educated , the less people are unemployed . 
  good for the former unemployed , good for you and good for the state . 
  yes , so am i. 
  we have that , as well , and anyone on social welfare ( who has n't studied before ) can of course start to study , just like anyone else . 
  the question is why they do n't . 
   `` it 's their fault !, 
  they could work but they do n't want to !, 
  they are spending my hard-earned money '' . 
  well , they are . 
  statistically , a lot more of the people on welfare are smokers and do drugs . 
  it * is * my hard earned money , it is the truth , and i absolutely hate it . 
  why should i pay for their smoking , drugs and drinking ? 
   you ca n't decide in which family you are born in . 
  as mentioned before - if you were born into a poor family , chances are good that you will be a poor person in your future life , if you were born into a rich family , there 's almost no way that you end up being poor . 
  actually , sweden is one of the best countries in the world being born into , when you take this into account , we have one of the highest mobility between social classes , so i * can * ask them . 
  i can ask them why they sit and smoke , and do n't apply for jobs . 
  i can ask them why they decide not to finish school etc. 
  do you study this issues ? 
  i do n't know how common adoption is in greece , but gay adoptions ( which are allowed in sweden , my country ) is rare . 
  that mostly comes down to the fact that almost all swedish adoptions comes from other countries , and there are very few that let gay people adopt . 
  however , that has been a huge relif for example for people who want their partner to be able to adopt their child , or just a gay person who for example ( it was a case in sweden ) wanted to adopt and care for his dead sisters children . 
  that does n't stop gay people from being parents however . 
  for example , surrogate mothers , sperm donations , or just male homosexual couple teaming up with lesbian couple , producing babies . 
  and , as far as everyone knows , these kids are just as happy , or unhappy , as normal kids , because that is what they are - normal . 
  i honestly think that is already happening in greece , so the only thing a refusal for marriage and adoption is doing is making it harder legally for the children . 
  i do not understand why one would want to do that . 
  and , last , when you sdiscuss with people who are against gay people being parents . 
  could the people who are against gay adoption/gay parents please provide studies that these children are worse off , than `` normal '' kids . 
  because , the fact is , i have n't heard about a single one , i just think people are being prejudicious . 
   is the money for university for free or do you have to pay it back ? 
  no , if you get ( roughly ) 8000 sek/month , 2000 is an `` allowance '' , the rest is a loan . 
  you will have to pay back the whole amount of the loan ( or possibly not after you are 60/65 or something similar ) . 
  also , every semester you have to pass 75 % of your exams.you have to start paying it back as soon as it is finished , however , it is easier to get a respite than from a normal bank loan . 
  we have to different sorts of unemployed , those who live on unemployment benefits , and those who live on social welfare . 
  those on welfare have never worked / have n't worked for a long time/been thrown out of the system , so they live on welfare . 
  the `` demands '' there are fairly minimal , basically non existant . 
  most people who has ( and stays ) on welfare are hardly particularely educated , or if they are , they have some sort of issue ( drugs , pain , mental etc ) . 
  of course one hardly has to go to university to get a good job , a lot of people have no formal education and are doing very well . 
  however , i suspect most of those people have a certain drive , that i think many of sweden 's welfare recipients lack . 
  why should they work ? 
  they get food on the table , rent , health care and apparently enough benefits so they can spend 1000 sek/month on cigarettes . 
  if they worked , they would probably start out with a simple job , not make that much more in the beginning , so why should they work ? 
  i also suspect that in any population , anywhere , 20-30 % are always lazy idiots , at least if you allow them to be . 
  we do . 
  if you are talking about those living on unemployment benefits , that is a bit different , and it was n't referred to in this program . 
  they have much stricter guidelines as well . 
  they have to apply to x number of jobs/month , be prepared to move everywhere within sweden etc. 
  i am sure things could be improved , both by the unemployed , and by the unemployment agency , but personally i do not hate on that half as much as i do on people living on welfare . 
  i do n't know how much a welfare reipient recieves in germany , but after rent here a single adult have 3000 sek ( there a lists published for every year ) , farly decent amount in my mind . 
  of course , that is for food , clothes , electricity , phone , but you can still survive on it . 
  remember , you do not do anything , at all . 
  and - like the mother i referred to , you get more if you have kids , at least 1000 sek/child , probably more . 
  so , no , i really do n't feel sorry for people living on welfare , and i question very much where my money is going . 
  are we allowed to grab us data ? 
  thank you for the tip , i 'll do that ( although i 'd rather post it at r/football , it is the real name after all :-) ) . 
   you will get support from the state if your unemployed and then want to start another education , schooling or go to university , wo n't you ? 
  depends , but generally for univerity for example you can get student loans and some money each month for five years . 
  it 's around 8000 sek month ( $ 1000 ) , 6000 loan , 2000 grant . 
   i really like this i do n't . 
  well , i do not mind supporting people who study for example , but many of the people who start on welfare , end up spending their life on welfare , the incentives to get out of it , are just to small . 
  apparently they are good enough to allow people to smoke too , so i am really wondering where my money is going - i am a student and i do n't have an extra 1000 sek/month to smoke for , like that mom . 
  swedish welfare recipients must be the whiniest and the laziest in the world , that is my real problem . 
   it 's very likely that you will be a long-term unemployed , too . 
  here too . 
  you are not as deadlocked as in the us , or perhaps not germany either , but a lot of them do tend to stay on welfare . 
  our debate about poverty was a bit difference . 
  it started with the fact that several aid organisations claimed that 10-15 % of all swedish children lived in poverty , could n't eat enough etc. 
  some journalists then decided to look into that claim and found out it was a complete hogwash , they could n't show a single kid without food , they had just said it to get money . 
  the debate then continued to discuss what poverty really is . 
  we have the same measurement as you , 60 % etc. 
  a mother interviewed in the show claimed that she did n't have enough money to pay for her son 's field trips - 200 sek/semester . 
  at the same time she had no problem smoking , which is 50 sek/day ... . . and the debate on welfare was on - again . 
  and , are you poor if you do n't have a cell phone etc. 
  if you ask me , they are not poor . 
  and the aid organisations have apologised , but probably lost a lot of support . 
   oh and as far as the lotr bullshit you posted , it is sub-consious propaganda to make tiny dicks like yourself feel better about your `` superior '' northern eu club . 
  i do n't have a dick , at all . 
  you are the one who keeps talking about northern europe , i think we all know who has a problem . 
   the whole 2113 thing you keep saying is your way of trying to paint me as a `` conspiracy nut '' by thinking there is some 100 year plan in the works , it is just your idiotic way of trying to prove me wrong . 
  what i said was that germany will need to find ways to power its booming economy for the next 50-100 years which is true , especially since they have or are planning to ban all nuclear energy in germany after the japan meltdown . 
  no , you said it was to become a protectorate , in 50 - 100 years , and that it was planned by the eu and the imf . 
  you are right however that i do think you are a conspiracy nut . 
  are you still mad that i do not belive that the eu , imf and other has orchestrated the greek bad economy , in order to make greece a protectorate in 2113 . 
  they are making this plan , hundred years in the future ( and started at least 50 years ago ) to profit from the billions of natural recources greece have in oil , natural gas etc. 
  the natural recourses that you claim that greece has , but offers no proof of , and apparently no one but you have heard of ? 
  does it bother you that i do not consider that the truth ? 
  to answer your question , it was certainly not meant as propaganda , just as a bit of fun in the midst of all the eu debate . 
  someone should informe them that [ swedish players can be black too ] ( http://svenskanamn.alltforforaldrar.se/uploads/15730/7e5f63e825570f1.jpg ) . 
  but they are not making money out of this tax . 
  second , i think the loss to france 's reputation/constantly bad pr about this must is bad , i for one certainly question hollande 's financial sense . 
  but seriously ... , i say this as a swede a.k.a 2nd highest taxed country in the world , this tax is not working out . 
  when we removed our `` wealth tax '' , we actually made money , since more people moved home or moved their money home . 
  this tax is not only making people move , it is most definitely giving france a bad reputation . 
  why impose a tax that gives you a really bad reputation ? 
  ok , good to know , i will not blame the poles for him ... 
  so why is he in the closet ? 
   considered radically leftist in the anti-statist sense in the rest of the world , including europe . 
  hardly radically left . 
  neoliberal perhaps . 
  still , it does n't explain a lot of other so called `` conservative '' states , canada , germany etc that support gay marriages .

the southerners are n't wrong though ... 
  stalin , great commissar of love . 
  for all the shit things lenin and his bolshevik thugs did , they did set it up to be the paradise they promised , only to have it all be ruined less than 10 years later . 
  i do wonder where the world would have gone , had n't the attempt on his life left him with such poor health . 
  ebola in the south , war in the east , nukes in the north . 
  good times . 
  thatcher never died , she just went home . 
  so one bottle of imported vodka then . 
  explain like i 'm slow , please . 
  does this mean if i go to scotland , germany , or wherever , my phone bill will be the same as if i had n't ? 
  exact same thing in sweden . 
  it 's enough that someone is registered with the unemployment office . 
  would n't be surprised if the number is at least twice as high . 
  at the very least . 
  confederacy of northern european states , anyone ? 
  edit : i was just joking , you guys . 
  let 's not pretend that the policies of the sweden democrats are anywhere near far-right . 
  because they are n't , not even a little . 
  they 're to the right of the left , and to the left of the right . 
  a centre-conservative party , that 's what they are . 
  and by swedish standards , the right is very red as is . 
  all it took was a couple of wars . 
  feminist * initiative . 
  but you 're right . 
  they 're crazy and sexist . 
  no one knows how to pronounce gdansk . 
  nobody puts suomi in a corner . 
  the extra 46 % come from the russians who need saving in ukraine . 
  typical danes , always so self-centred . 
  the good old days . 
  praise thor . 
  i 'll call luca brasi . 
  damn immigrants . 
  oh , sorry , `` youths '' . 
  if these people want palestine to succeed , then go join the fight . 
  do n't harass hardworking civilians . 
  there is nothing honorable in this . 
  just opportunistic assholes . 
  more like a threat that needs to be walled-off . 
  the last thing anyone wants is conflict on russian soil . 
  too big to grasp for many people . 
  it 's the small things that matter . 
  like increased tax on tomatoes . 
  also it 's sweden . 
  there 's never not rain or snow here . 
  12 months a slave, 
  definitely a metaphor on the us playing it cool . 
  nope . 
  it 's just a barbeque . 
  so this must be were the ( new ) swedish word ` hen ' comes from ? 
  i like your spelling more though . 
  here , in sweden , the american confederate flag is the flag of the raggare . 
  way to go , finland !, 
  love , sweden, 
  netherlands ? 
  well i 've never ... 
  i feel like the feet of lenin would be fun too , because of the double entendre . 
  i 'll buy one if you guys do n't want them . 
  it would look nice out in the garden . 
  then feel free to take the first flight to china and not come back . 
  speak for yourself . 
  i do n't give any money because i 'm an asshole . 
  at this point they could just buy greece . 
  unique unit for ukraine . 
  +2 movement each turn . 
  youtube now translates all on its own !, 
  if you change your mind , we will take you back . 
  carl xvi gustaf could use something impressive on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 after last year . 
  youth is code for immigrant . 
  the muslim invasion has a long way to go before outnumbering 600 million europeans . 
  come to sweden . 
  we seem to go through this every time a map centering around the eu shows up ( about a dozen times each day ) . 
  europe has become synonymous with the eu , much like america has with the us . 
  it 's here to stay . 
  clearly the measles make people religious . 
  danes do n't know how good they have it , neighbour . 
  yes , registration and participation in an activity ( job coaches , internships , social programmes ) is required to receive any form of economic assistance . 
  which actually means that the numbers are higher , at least in sweden , since to be considered unemployed you have to be registered at the unemployment office and actively take part in their programs - which a lot of the unemployed ( young adults ) are not doing , because they are fed up with no help and no results . 
  i could say the same to you , fr\u00e5n en svensk till en annan . 
  i 'll be celebrating the 6th of june a little bit harder ` cus of that one . 
  the former danish/swedish realms sure do act nicely . 
  neigh, 
  thanks for all the hay . 
  how would this ever stay intact for so long ? 
  so many forces would work against it . 
  the elements , the natives , foreigners ... 3500 years is a long time for something to just stand about . 
  because you 've been doing * that * for hundreds and hundreds of years . 
  it 's culture !, 
  prost !, 
  it 's good that we are creating a large underclass of people ( that may or may not be illegals ) all over europe . 
  this is the first step to becoming the united states of europe . 
  we need the cheap labour to take care of our lawns . 
  i think you mean this analogy the other way around , because otherwise hussars were n't very impressive . 
  it 's amazing what a common hatred can do to bring people together . 
  welcome to new russia , same as old russia, 
  best english accents . 
  seems like swedish rule had a positive impact after all !, 
  you take it back for us , you can be nordic all you want . 
  get a new flag and everything . 
  no , that 's a sin .

  just type fast . 
  but the news never really broadcasts speeches from foreigners live anyway . 
   i do n't get why people make such a big deal of it . 
  people literally die from that switch . 
  it disrupts everyone 's sleep , making accidents a little more likely . 
  there 's a spike in car accidents the day after each switch . 
  depends on where you live . 
  up here , the sun wo n't be up when you leave home in the morning anyway , so that hour of light is useless . 
  initially to piss off everyone else . 
  now they do n't want to be known as the country that suddenly changes their mind about asylum and hands you over after guaranteeing your safety . 
  that prestige is worth far more than the cost of having him living in the embassy . 
  in sweden it 's pretty much all subtitles . 
  the only things that ever get dubbed are children 's shows . 
  but they promise help only on the condition that the treaties preventing them from providing such help no longer apply ( i.e. 
  which seems fair . 
  you still sleep for the same number of hours/minutes . 
  it 's not like your sleep cycle knows what the clock says . 
  why would the time zone have any effect on your sleep cycles ? 
  if you go to bed at the same time and get up at the same time , does it really matter that the clocks are set differently ? 
   or maybe wake up when the sun rises . 
  this gets tricky when the sun sets in november and does n't rise again until february . 
   so on winter mornings one has to wait for yet another hour to see the sun rise ? 
  no thanks . 
  that 's already the case in the northern half of europe . 
  this would mean you 'd actually get some sunlight on the way home , rather than going to work in darkness and coming home in darkness in december and january . 
  but everything is digital and has gps now anyway , so it adjusts itself . 
  then you get to choose . 
  do you set the clock based on your orbit and when it 's light and dark for you , or do you just set it to a 24 hour cycle based on wherever ground control is located ? 
  for a place like the iss that orbits the earth every ~ 90 minutes , the first option would be very inconvenient . 
  just head north and you can have as much sun as you want in the summer . 
   time zones are only very distantly related to them . 
  not * that * distantly . 
  and the fact that it 's not perfect now is not a very good excuse for making it even worse . 
  you can have an * almost * natural day cycle . 
  it 's not all or nothing . 
   if daylight saving time is convenient for us , we can totally do it . 
  dst is n't very popular these days . 
  i do n't expect it to be around for much longer , especially considering that the switch to and from it kills people . 
  they get to vote like anyone else . 
  i 'm also not trying to say what 's right or wrong , just trying to explain what the racists believe . 
  it makes sense if you think it 's each country 's business who they allow in . 
  the idea that each `` race '' should stay in their designated area and manage themselves is usually popular . 
  so if spain wants to accept brits , that 's spain 's prerogative and spain 's problem . 
  that does n't mean that britain has to accept spaniards . 
  it has no recognized scientific definition when applied to humans , but the whole idea of `` racism '' used to be to not really care about that . 
  the first one is from ancient greek . 
  i think the last two are latin . 
  that * is * something to be proud of , though . 
   ever heard of loanwords ? 
  they 're very convenient . 
  i only know a handful of russian words , but could still read it just from ( mostly ) knowing the alphabet . 
  debatable , considering that austria was annexed by germany for most of that . 
  he 's from austria and is most famous for ruling an empire that austria was a part of . 
  the modern german federation ( formed relatively recently when the west and east united ) was also part of that empire , but is n't the same state and had significantly different borders . 
  and when that was n't enough , you went off to conquer places with a monsoon season . 
  that was never a problem . 
  the brits settled in the rainiest place they could find for a reason . 
  `` conversation '' by finnish standards . 
  this map just means they can mumble * fuck * instead of * perkele * while they stab you . 
  most ketchup has so little vinegar in it anyway that it 's like it 's trying to be salsa . 
  that 's only because all british dialects are considered english , no matter how unintelligible . 
  if you added the requirement that they must be able to hold a conversation with someone * other than their neighbor * , the dutch would probably win . 
  the second one * does * have a point . 
  hindsight and all that , but if there had n't been international support for the early revolutions of the arab spring , the syrian civil war would never have happened , and isis would never have emerged . 
  the middle east would probably have been more stable today if no one had meddled . 
  egyptians and tunisians may disagree , though . 
  black , yellow , white , red , blue , greenish , brown . 
  they 're trying out a new flag concept . 
  berlin and istanbul too . 
  if they had the sense to go back and remove the lock when they break up then sure . 
  right now it 's just an endlessly accumulating pile of metal junk , and 90 % of the teenage cruhes that caused them have long since ended . 
   uppsala seems fairly close to stockholm so that the average stockholmer can commute to it , same goes for helsingsborg and malmo with lund almost , sort of , maybe . 
  i think it 's an hour by train from central stockholm to uppsala . 
  if your parents live in the southern parts of stockholm , expect to have at least a 1 1/2 hour commute each way . 
  lund is closer ( to malm\u00f6 ) , but most of the university campus are at the opposite end of the town from the train station , so a one hour commute is still pretty likely . 
  i guess it depends on what kind of commute you 're okay with . 
  yeah , but the scandinavians are n't necessarily moving out because they have more money than they know what to do with . 
  they have enough money to be able to go to the best university that will have them , instead of just the closest one , and that means they have to move out . 
  depends on how picky you are , i guess . 
  the two most prestigious universities are in small towns where half the population are students or staff . 
   here in italy you 'd be considered lucky if you manage to qualify for unemployment ... you 're not going to qualify for that in sweden either unless you 've actually had a job for a year or more . 
  this is either people who have jobs or students ( who often have to move to study , as the population density is so low ) . 
  because the distances do n't allow for commuting . 
   but a chunk that 's just as large just goes to the closest uni . 
  in scandinavia , the closest university can still be quite far away . 
  there 's also a pretty big difference in prestige between them , so if you want to go to one of the `` fancy '' universities ( lund , uppsala , ki ) , you 're probably going to have to move . 
  often indirectly . 
  a lot of these people will be students , and * have to * move away from their parents in order to study . 
  it 's every stereotype come to life . 
  the frenchman even has a suit that fits better . 
  they probably picked maltese . 
   can countries register more than one language ? 
  if not then it seems like an easy enough change to make . 
  just change the rule so that it 's okay under exceptional circumstances , accept this as such a circumstance , then deny any other requests from other countries . 
  or as someone suggested , just `` forget '' to take it off the list . 
   except the european union does next to nothing militarily ... 
  better to have an army and not need it than to need an army and not have one . 
  the fact that the option exists influences how you can approach foreign policy . 
  it 's from before the 2007 depression , the euro crisis , the arab spring , the syrian civil war , the revolution in ukraine , and the migrant crisis . 
  a lot has happened in ten years .

my favourite . 
  but why did you not apply for protected designation of origin ? 
  chorizo has become popular enough for swedish producers to make their own version and those are horrible : http://www.scan.se/produkter/6029/chorizo/, 
   there are allot of people that do n't want democracy , and democracy itself has allot of flaws . 
  that is so true . 
  and i think attempting to bomb iraq into a democracy probably was not a good idea . 
  but the eu is different . 
  the eu is not ` expanding ' like an imperialistic force on its own . 
  no nation has been forced into the eu . 
  rather , many countries wanted to join the eu because they actually thought it was something to strive for . 
  perhaps they like democracy , freedom and the economy eu can offer ? 
  should we not welcome them if that is what they want ? 
  putin seem to not care about the people of ukraine or elsewhere and is prepared to use military force to coerce nations and expand his empire . 
  we should not accept it . 
   putin is kinda taking ukraine back the idea that putin can ` take anything back ' is a dangerous one and the eu would be wise to try convince him otherwise . 
  it becomes even more dangerous if putin knows he can get away with it . 
  allowing putin to grow his ego ( and russia to expand its borders ) without interfering may very well end up being more costly than trying to stop him . 
  that said , it is not an easy decision what to do . 
  but some support to ukraine to strengthen their self defence seems very reasonable . 
  perhaps not as bad as becoming puppets under putin . 
  besides , eu does not need to wage a war , only make sure ukraine does not lose its war . 
  i would n't blame them ... and it does n't seem like a too unrealistic scenario . 
  putin is a bully now , but imagine what he will become if he gets away with invading ukraine . 
  eu leaders need to understand that whatever it will cost to stop him , not stopping him might be far more more costly in the long run . 
   he knows the seeds for division have been sown and they only need time so that they may grow . 
  that i believe . 
  in that sense he is playing his realpolitik well . 
  but what about the costs ? 
  was it worth it ? 
  i do n't know , it probably depends on how you value things . 
  but i do believe russia would have been stronger if he sought peace rather than conflict with the ukraine . 
   where has the game changed ? 
  it has changed everywhere ( to some extent ) and this is the main reason putin has not yet invaded ukraine . 
  the costs are too high and there is very little to gain . 
  right now he is just punishing them for ego . 
  but russia is getting weaker by the minute and putin was recently forced to plunder two years worth of pension payments , just to support crimea . 
  the sanctions and trade war with the west is not helping either . 
  i wonder how long before russians start to look back to the good old days in 2013 ... 
  i do n't believe putin wants a war with the ukraine . 
  he did want to tie them tighter to russia economically but that failed . 
  right now it is just bullying . 
  i do n't think he will go for a full scale war , but he might try to grab some more land , because he can . 
   but this is how the ` game ' is played at the international level the game has changed but putin is still playing by the old rules and because of that he is currently losing . 
  the new game is about trade , growth and economic strength . 
  the weapons are not nuclear but agreements between nations and blocks such as eu , nafta , wto etc. 
  putin may have won crimea and he may stalled ukraine and he may even invade but his people and his nation are falling behind because of it . 
  putin himself may have been strengthen by war-mongering but a strong position in your country is not winning the game on the international level , or kim jong-un would be announced the winner by a margin ( only in north korea ) . 
  putin may very well find himself in a similar spot , unless he realises that the game has changed . 
  that would have been a better analysis imho . 
  the usa , is the only nation capable of playing by both the old and the new rules , but the secret is to never start a war with one of your neighbours . 
  would you believe it if i told you the author is not a journalist , but a [ professor of political science at the university of chicago ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_mearsheimer ) ? 
  i predict many more ` accidents ' before this is over . 
  edit : [ ukraine : 4 border guards killed in russian helicopter attack ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-4-border-guards-killed-in-russian-helicopter-attack-2014-8 ), 
  and that is why you try to be nice to your neighbours or risk them turning away from you . 
   at the same time , the eu 's expansion eastward and the west 's backing of the pro-democracy movement in ukraine -- beginning with the orange revolution in 2004 -- were critical elements , too . 
  the eu is not ` expanding ' like an imperialistic force on its own . 
  rather , many countries wanted to join the eu because they actually thought it was something to strive for . 
  perhaps they like democracy , freedom and the economy eu can offer ? 
  should the eu deny them what they want just because putin 's offer is so much worse ? 
  from the article :  many members of parliament `` are allies of the militants-separatists , '' poroshenko said , referring to the pro-russian rebels who have battled government troops in the country 's east since april . 
  poroshenko believes they will not likely be elected this time and that would make it easier for him to defend his country . 
  also :  he emphasized the need to elect new leaders from the war-torn areas of east ukraine in order to represent the region in the new government . 
  i 'll do it anyway , for humanity  too bad it is difficult to get hold of ukrainian beer in stockholm . 
  i bet if a pub/bar would offer it right now , they would get a lot of attention . 
  give with one hand and smack them in the back of their head with the other . 
  how about buying the [ ukrainian beer russia do n't want , too ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20140814-russia-bans-ukrainian-beer-calorie-sanctions/ ) . 
  i 'll do anything for a good cause . 
  i think you forget that most people do n't speak russian . 
  can we please get at least a partial translate ? 
  edit : i got [ this from bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28817347 ) :  `` i 'd like to give you some good news , '' he says . 
  `` at present , moving towards the corridor [ a link across the border into russia established by the rebels ] are ... 150 items of military hardware , 30 of which are tanks and the rest are infantry fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers . '', 
  also :  he added that the vehicles were accompanied by 1,200 personnel who had received four months ' training in russia . 
  edit2 : i see , / u/spin0 also found the same bbc story . 
  interestingly , the massive protests against the coming war against iraq did not take place in countries allied with the defender iraq . 
  it was mostly citizens in the aggressor country , usa , and its close and distant allies that protested in hope of stopping the aggressor 's plans to go to war . 
  maybe you should ask why russians do n't protest ? 
  maybe they were going to pick up ` supplies ' at the border . 
  agree , it was probably a stretch saying crimea did fine . 
  but it is way worse now after they have been cut off from ukrainian infrastructure . 
  and i can not blame the ukraine for that . 
   i do think it 's good that the russians are chipping in to help the development of crimea . 
  i seem to remember crimea doing just fine before putin 's land grab . 
  that said , i do agree that russia now has an obligation to help them . 
  but that does n't change the fact that it is a cost of putin 's imperialistic ambitions payed by the russian peoples pensions . 
   hate to step on the circle jerk , but people are rarely asked for their opinions before entering wars or other foreign policy actions . 
  were americans asked before they entered iraq ? 
  true . 
  and bush did go to war despite [ massive protests world wide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protests_against_the_iraq_war ) . 
  interestingly , starting a war seem do do wonder with your approval ratings in the short run , wether you are [ bush ] ( http://www.hist.umn.edu/~ruggles/approval.htm ) or [ putin ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-plane-crash/poll-putins-approval-rating-all-time-high-russia-n161161 ) . 
  but in the long run it may come back and bite you in the ass . 
  war comes at a cost that may not be obvious in the early phases when the propaganda machine works on overdrive . 
  the iraq war probably helped deepen the 2008 crisis in the usa due to its [ astronomical cost ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/financial_cost_of_the_iraq_war ) . 
  and putin 's war budget has already confiscated 2 years of pensions in russia . 
  i think this is the most important message today . 
  war is not good and it will cost you . 
  do n't reward warmongering leaders with high approval ratings . 
  they may not all be aware of it yet , but they are paying for crimea with their future pensions :  desperate for cash to develop crimea , the russian government has dipped into the national pension fund , essentially deciding to confiscate everything its citizens will contribute to it this year and the next . 
  `` no one has any intention of giving this money back , because this money has gone to crimea , '' said finance minister anton siluanov .

  profit making companies are building wind farms in huge projects spanning years in the location where their studies says it 's best because our less than a year old government is retarded ? 
  i was talking about our lappland not your half . 
  it 's a map of a * simulation * of the amount of wind at 10 to 80 meters if i read the study correctly . 
  if someone builds where your simulation says it should be shit to build then you should see it as a hint that your simulation was n't perfect . 
  there are loads of new wind power being built in lapland so the wind map is probably inaccurate in some way there . 
  we get different things . 
  sure we pay more than we get but the improved trade relations with the rest of europe ( especially germany ) is important . 
  and above that it 's because of the eu that we in scandinavia have had the possibility to influence fishing and environmental policies of the rest of the states around the baltic . 
  the integration of the baltics into the nordics is also a major win for us , we would not have been able to get them toward our sphere alone .

  the cultural differences between regions are very important for technological progress and i believe that language is an important factor in that .

   cultural , political and social cultural : not all languages are the same and some things are much harder to express in some than in others . 
  grammatical processes like verbing that are easy in some languages but harder in others slightly affects the whole culture and the views of its people . 
  political : that one is easy as according to some nations all who speak their language belong to their ethnic group and as such is in need of their protection .

  might i ask why ? 
  i agree , very descriptive and lacks that vulgar quality that many similar words seems to have . 
  if there 's anything that needs less stigma it 's female masturbation . 
  that 's simple to explain . 
  there is a specific word for male masturbation but not any for female masturbation . 
  so it 's not that all words for masturbation are male-oriented , it 's just that our language lacks a good female-counterpart to the male one . 
  it just makes our language more precise . 
  actress is not needed because the word for actor can be considered neutral . 
  this is correct . 
  and the not so subtle jab from a certain french user at our interest in equality comes across as fairly ignorant to me .

  absolutely agree with the idea of a slightly less severe ( chilly ? ), 
  cold war . 
  in my above posts i 've even acknowledged that an actual confrontation is unlikely , but at the end of the day i 'd prefer spending more money to be sure . 
  defending my country is tied to my political beliefs and i do feel solidarity with others in europe . 
  a conflict involving russia and the west in some way would likely be destabilisation efforts through `` independent '' groups using electronic warfare and perhaps arming and organisation of groups such as the huge russian presence in parts of the baltics . 
  so the question is , where does nato draw the line in such a conflict ? 
  and does that imply for sweden ? 
  because of that uncertainty i prefer to be a little too paranoid rather than a little too naive . 
  sure , but russian violations of swedish airspace sharply declined after the end of the cold war and is only starting to increase again the last few years . 
  aggressive person ? 
  hardly . 
  aggressive style of debate ? 
  maybe . 
  i 'm passionate about defense questions because as a liberal i believe that all the rights and benefits that comes with living in sweden and europe are connected to the duty to also defend those , militarily and otherwise . 
  even if still unlikely , a conflict between russia and western europe is most certainly something we will * not * be able to stay out of , even disregarding notions of solidarity because of how extremely dependent our economy is on trade and the state of global finance , something that will certainly face critical shocks in the event of such a war . 
  oh so all the russian violations of swedish airspace this year and practise bombing raids against swedish targets are also part of the conspiracy ? 
  furthermore , you 're wrong since the current government is planning to increase defense spending and is even considering reestablishing conscription . 
  the recurring message from the swedish armed forces has been : - '' * this is not a submarine hunt , we lack the resources for that so what we are doing is to be classified as an intelligence gathering mission * . '', 
  - '' * we have evidence of `` foreign underwater activity '' ( mini-submarines or divers ) in swedish territorial waters , specifically this region for several years . 
  * - * we have highly plausible indications that such activity is currently taking place * [ not too sure about terminology but what they 're using the official term that implies the highest possible degree of supsicions ] * but we can not confirm any speculation about nationality or purpose . 
  * now , you can believe it 's a conspiracy where the impoverished swedish armed forces just launched a huge and costly operation to acquire funds and join nato if you want . 
  personally i believe russia is doing most of the fear-mongering itself , regardless of swedish media . 
  they 've spent all spring and summer violating swedish air space and practising bombing raids against swedish targets , so why would n't they be doing the same under water ? 
  swedish defense politics the last 25 years has pretty much been '' * hey look , russia will either embrace our system of peaceful democracy and market liberalism , or be poor and toothless !, 
  we wo n't need a national defense ever again , let 's decimate the budget and put what meagre resources are still available into foreign peace keeping . 
  * '' turns out russia found a third way and we 'd be stupid not to listen to the ringing alarm bells . 
  fuck ukrainians who believe they have the right to make sovereign democratic decisions regardless of their much more powerful neighbour with nostalgic imperial ambitions right ? 
  i suppose you also support al-qaeda and the `` islamic state '' then ? 
  instead of downvoting you , i 'm curious to know why you support russia ? 
  where are you from ? 
  hey lukashenko , do n't bite the hand that feeds you ... 
  even if it feeds you toilet paper and soy . 
  and the dresser . 
  and the table . 
  and the chair ... 
  russia gets criticized here a lot mostly because of your backwards , corrupt , anti-democratic , militaristic government rather than russian people in general . 
  then there is of course cultural stereotypes of alcoholism , dashcams , poor education and other things , but i would n't call that racism unless you 'd also qualify stereotypes of racist , bible-thumping cousin-marrying , weapon-wielding , flag-waving rednecks in the us south as racism . 
  thanks !, 
  this was the kind of explanation i was looking for !, 
  explanation please ? 
  the free movement of labor across eu borders is one of the fundamental pillars of the union . 
  if this is causing problems for a national economy , it 's their own fault . 
  malta is and island , morocco is comparatively safe and stable , mexico is n't filled with extremists and weak , collapsing governments . 
  and it 's not like * huge * floods of people , weapons , drugs do n't enter the us despite big walls and barbed fence ... 
  your second point is spot on though , i agree completely . 
  the shift of power matters * way * more than religion , which is what i 've argued against all along . 
  yeah , unfortunately it does n't matter who 's at fault when germany , greece and cyprus can use their vetos . 
   as if eastern eu does n't border an unstable region hah , are you comparing russia to iraq , syria , lebanon ... ? 
   cyprus is a short boat trip from the levant , malta from africa , spain even has exclaves in muslim africa smuggling of people , weapons and other things are way harder to control along long land borders ( how much control does the turkish government actually have over the kurdish mountain borders ? ), 
  than to and from islands or heavily gated and guarded enclaves in spain and morocco is pretty stable . 
   i guarantee you if anatolia were under christian greek rule this would n't even be a conversation . 
  if you want to believe it is only about religion , i 'd say you 're very misinformed . 
  one of them is * definitely * religion . 
  but there are of course loads of other reasons : - turkey 's growing authoritarianism - decades of hostility towards press and journalists - treatment of kurds ( although seemingly heading in the right direction now ) - refusal to recognize the armenian holocaust - the issue of cyprus - millions of turks living in germany for decades or generation without getting citizenship - the huge population in general , proximity to and borders with volatile-as-fuck middle eastern states ...

  from my post :  the build-up to which was ** caused by governments of both sides ** in the decades before . 
  [ swedish governments 1975-2006 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dw49auz.png?1 ) my `` re-writing history '' comes from a university semester of economics , with former member of centre-right folkpartiet , anders bergh as head lecturer and author of the course literature : [ * `` the conclusion is that both political blocs should be blamed for the stagnation \\ [ of swedish economy \\ ] and - especially - both blocs should be credited for greatly increasing economic freedom in sweden during the last two decades of the 1900 's . 
  ** edit : ** i should clarify that i originally meant that the crisis broke out during bildt , his politics just sped up the process while the opposition did n't do much to help . 
  my point that we have a better economy today partly because of the financial clean-up during the following social democratic governments under g\u00f6ran persson still stands . 
  some insight from someone who voted for the former centre-right government last election , and against it in this one : - the swedish economy has done great through the crisis in part because of a competent finance minister , * but also * because we already suffered through [ financial crisis in the early 90 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_banking_rescue ) , the build-up to which was caused by governments of both sides in the decades before . 
  - the crisis broke out because of the frivolous dergulations by the centre-right government of carl bildt , and was cleaned up by social democrats , leaving a stable and sound economy for the centre-right government we 've had through the current crisis . 
  my reasons for voting agianst the centre-right government : - despite 8 years of reforms and lots of money , school grades keep plummeting . 
  - there has been a rush to privatize schools , hospitals , care for the elderly with little or no benefit for society and little or no regulations , and several scandals were investors have bought such welfare institutions , cutting costs by firing people and lowering expenses , and then selling or declaring bankruptcy . 
  - they have continued the left-wing tradition of cutting defense spending . 
  the left wing actually has a more credible defense policy nowadays . 
  - our absolutely brainless minister of justice , beatrice ask . 
  she has not completed any education over high school , no education in law whatsoever . 
  contrary to international research , she advocates severe punishments for crime , especially related to violence and drugs . 
  she also thinks * suspected * sex offenders should recieve mail in bright purple lettering because , i do n't even know , shaming criminal suspects before any legal proceedings have begun is a good idea ? 
  - [ the catastrophic nuon deal ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/blogs/corneliushamelberg/?p=17646 ) , which cost taxpayers billions , which our prime minister , financial minister and former businiess minister lied about in constitutional hearings . 
  lying , corruption , incompetence or a combination of above ? 
  edit : gold !? 
  for this barely sourced , poorly spell-checked statement of my personal opinions ? 
  [ well , thank you !, 
  ( i can absolutely read what you 're writing in catalan ! ), 
  i never said i think languages are stupid , i said nationalism is - which is why i , unlike you , do n't care which language you spell geographical names in . 
  as i said , i do n't think you and i can have any constructive conversation about nationalism , since i think nationalism in general is stupid , divisive and destructive and i do n't care even a little bit which language you choose to spell sweden/suecia/su \u00e8cia , catalonia/catalu \u00f1a / catalunya or spain/espa \u00f1a / espanya . 
  claro que no compatriota mio !, 
  you can spell * catalu\u00f1a * in english or catalan if you want , but i 'll continue using the castilian spelling . 
  that 's exactly how it was when i lived there around 2005-2006 in catalu\u00f1a . 
  for example , construction sites were * everywhere * and they were invariably staffed by northern africans , subsaharians and eastern europeans . 
  then the financial crisis happened , the construction sector imploded and spanish economy went down the toilet . 
  the article and i are not talking about people who feel like change of scenery , we 're talking about people fleeing persecution , war , genocide . 
  * refugees * , not immigrants . 
  these people need more support and incentive to integrate and become productive members of society rather than living on welfare , which is what our state is failing to do . 
  if it were up to me , refugees would be given free - and mandatory - therapy and classes in swedish , easier access to low level jobs , training and so on . 
  the problem is neither our housing market or our employment markets are designed for this . 
  a high percentage of jobs require high-skill/educated labour . 
  yes , the problem is we suck at integration . 
  refugees do n't learn swedish , become part of society and get jobs . 
  this is the fault of both main political blocks over at least two decades , and none of them want to admit that fact . 
  therefore the only party that critizes current policy is a formerly neo-nazi populist moral conservative one , * filled * with people who are stupid enough to go on social media and post shockingly hateful , racist , homophobic and islamophobic things , despite the party 's official zero-tolerance on these things . 
  that 'd be letting the terrorists win !, 
  they will * never * take my beard !, 
  agreed . 
  the moment the us credibility in defending its allies is questioned is the moment china starts steamrolling through sea and the middle east explodes . 
  yeah personally i 'm for nato membership or at least an extensive defense pact with finland or any of our neighbours . 
  that being said , attacking sweden without involving finland or the baltics would be pretty complicated and fuck up the already fragile eu economy so much that the rest of the eu would feel the sting .

  so , when isis claims responsibility for this and says that they are behind this attack , they look like idiots because this was n't planned and it was n't a terrorist act . 
  if you know anything about christiania and the guys living there , you 'd know how ludicrous the claim is . 
  it 's a place where about 800 hippie danes ( many of which are middle-aged ) live and smoke weed , and they feel adventurous by cultivating this anarchist image . 
  but it 's just an image . 
  anyway , two police officers apparently went in to take a cannabis dealer into custody , completely routine non-dramatic stuff , when the dealer suddenly pulled a gun and tried to shoot himself free . 
  that 's all it is . 
  you , i like you !, 
   a house arrest would soon become known to social services and law enforcement . 
  is this a bad joke ? 
  or are you simply unaware ? 
  it has been reality for years at this point , women in the hardcore islamic households typically are n't allowed to go out . 
  so tell me , what is law enforcement doing ? 
  these women are n't physically restrained at home , they are told by their husbands that they should n't leave and then they obey . 
  that 's not even illegal , it 's just fucked up . 
   wtf . 
  do you think letting this practice grow and grow is the better alternative . 
  on the contrary , i 'd like a future without burqas , and that 's why i 'm against a ban . 
  maybe that 's too complicated for you to understand , but if you tell someone that they ca n't do what they want they 'll just keep doing it . 
  the only cure for religion is education , and education requires people to have some belief in the state -- if children in muslim families are brought up hearing that the oppressive western government hates them and wo n't even let them wear their own clothes , they 'll feel nothing but resentment . 
  they 'll reject anything western ( including the education ) , and they will widen the gap between muslims and the rest of society , and that is * how we lose . 
  * we win when they make the choice to be more western/liberal themselves , and that 's done through education . 
  for another example , look at how child marriages in africa are fought : through education , and it fails when the locals start seeing the white teachers/missionaries as the oppressors -- when they start to think in terms of us vs. them they start to reject anything we say , and that 's how we lose . 
  i 'm not a fan and * that 's * why i would n't ban it . 
  getting rid of oppressive religions is only possible through education , banning things as personal as clothes is only going to make them dig their heels in and feel like justified martyrs . 
  it 's counter-productive . 
  they have to choose not to wear a burqa , if someone else tells them that they ca n't it wo n't work . 
  sure , but it could always be better . 
   cause is hardline islam doctrine . 
  showing it is ok to stop following parts of the doctrine helps . 
  yes , that would help , and it 's best done through education . 
  it is shown again and again that the only cure for backwards religious beliefs and/or oppressive cultures is education . 
  forcing someone 's hand is counter-productive , it 'll only make them dig in their heels and feel like martyrs . 
  they 'll be less likely to listen to other things coming from `` the oppressive western regime '' that wo n't even let them wear their own clothes , which widens the gap between muslims and the rest of society . 
  it also makes them less likely to accept education from the state if they begin to see the state as an organisation that harasses them . 
  my goal is that europe ( and the world ) in the future will be without burqas , and indeed without any religious/cultural beliefs that infringe on people 's liberties . 
  in order to reach that goal , i absolutely * do n't * want to see a ban on burqas because it 's stupid and short-sighted , and will only make it so much harder to actually reach the goal . 
  read what he said again , until you understand it . 
  he did n't say that he is for the wearing of burkinis if those are illegal , he said * it does n't make sense to outlaw them in the first place . 
  lesser ? 
  what in the fuck ? 
  do you think life-long house arrest is better than wearing a burqa ? 
  i agree . 
  but we have pesky things like the public opinion . 
  the public in most countries is deathly afraid of nuclear power , it 's a hard slog to lobby for the research and building of new reactors , however awesome they are . 
  remember fukushima ? 
  it resulted in huge anti-nuclear demonstrations across germany , [ leading to a pledge by merkel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_power_in_germany ) two months later to phase out nuclear power in germany . 
  that 's just one example . 
  some eu countries have long had a complete ban on new reactors , such as spain . 
  france and belgium are currently considering going the german route to move away from nuclear power . 
  it 's very , very easy to scare the public with nasty words they do n't really understand , such as `` radiation . '', 
  yes , both those things are true , and then there 's a third thing : it uses up the most long-lived isotopes , meaning that the waste that is finally thrown out is less radioactive than the nuclear waste we have produced so far , and it has a half-life measured in hundreds of years instead of hundreds of thousands of years . 
  suddenly we do n't need to design storage that needs to be kept safe for goddamned geological eras , it only has to be safe for 300 years or so which is much more feasible . 
   some random foreign shop in weird colors ah , warms my heart . 
  did you respond to the right comment ? 
  i never realised you were behind the iron curtain . 
  my condolences . 
  yeah . 
  of course we could go the `` united states '' route too if we wanted to , but most europeans do n't want that . 
  that 's not what it says . 
  it says that lasers that are so high-powered , or used in such a way , as to blind the sight of anyone are banned . 
  and that 's a fair rule , because how would you defend yourself against being crippled by that kind of laser weapon ? 
  then the text explicitly says that if you use binoculars , this rule does n't apply to you . 
  that 's also fair , because the smallest laser pointer on a keychain could blind anyone if they look at it through binoculars . 
  hell , you do n't even need a laser , many regular lights and lamps could possibly blind you through binoculars . 
  and , it 's avoidable , because you do n't have to look at the enemy with binoculars if they are using lasers as a deterrent . 
  since you have been told what the protocol means in several places in this thread , and still do n't understand it , i suggest that you refrain from using it as a source until you get it . 
  russia has broken many laws and customs of war in ukraine , but this is n't one of them . 
  the eu is not a country , it 's a cooperation between sovereign countries . 
  the whole point is that nobody is in charge , or not in charge * enough * to make those kinds of decisions at least . 
  is n't that last part a very flawed argument ? 
  it 's okay to treat black people bad as long as they 're treated badly everywhere else too ? 
  i do n't buy it . 
  fair enough . 
  it 's an acronym , but they do n't like it . 
  but they do n't like it . 
  daesh is a short form which they despise , apparently because it has other connotations . 
  they prefer the longer terms or simply `` the islamic state '' as they want to put focus on being a real ~ ~ boy ~ ~ country . 
  or radical islam . 
  i do n't think `` lone wolf '' is ever used in a calming fashion when discussing terrorism . 
  on the contrary , that 's the main problem . 
  if only groups of 10-20 well organised guys could commit terrorist acts we would n't have a problem , and our intelligence agencies would stand a good chance of finding them . 
  but take someone like the nice perpetrator , he had no known terrorist sympathies at all before the attack . 
  he was a nobody , did n't show up on anyone 's radar , radicalised alone online . 
  it 's impossible to defend yourself against people like him , though it * is * possible to defend yourself against larger attacks like the planned hit on jyllands-posten that was averted . 
  his username alone might be enough to draw fire in a lot of subs . 
  that particular neighbourhood might be best skipped even in the summer . 
  are you implying that people outside europe know what slovenia is or where to find it ? 
  austria is n't a very important country in europe today , but a lot of non-europeans have heard about some empire called austria-hungary , and maybe they know that you eat schnitzel . 
  slovenia is as forgettable as countries get . 
  it 's clearly a codeword for something , but i dare not ask what . 
  exactly , that 's my method as well . 
  * and i looked , and behold !, 
  a pale horse , and his name that sat on him was death , and hell followed with him . 
  i 'm not sure i understand the reference . 
  education will help the drug problem , it always does . 
  though i probably live in another country than you do , i live in a country where no one has declared any `` war on drugs , '' because it 's not needed . 
  yes , but in this case with 90 % of the population behind the law . 
  as i just wrote [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4slp8x/nine_out_of_ten_danes_would_ban_ritual/d5af8e1 ) , it works when the laws and public opinion are in accord . 
  that is , when the norm is well-defined , people conform to society 's * norms * , which is n't the same as the laws . 
  but laws help shape norms .

   nobody criticizes denmark or uk for not going along with the refugee scheme . 
  i would n't say nobody but i can read swedish newspapers . 
  then again i doubt most swedes even know denmark , uk and ireland have an opt out regarding all this stuff . 
  great game guys , a lot of exciting wars . 
  thanks for the links !, 
  also , oh wow thats a shitstorm , i hope you succeed in containing that madness . 
  so i read the translation of the article and got a few question . 
  what exactly is it that the government has done ? 
  from what i can gather from the text it has something to do with the new government violating the constitution and restricting the independance of the courts . 
  here 's the thing you have an opt out on the schengen agreement , the emu , the charter of fundamental rights and the area of freedom , security and justice . 
  asylum policy is included in the area of freedom , security and justice . 
  you already do not apply european rules on the area of refugees . 
  thats why you 're already opted out of taking a share of refugees under the eu quota . 
  how many opt outs does the uk need ? 
  you have the most in the eu already by far . 
  most eu nations have 0 opt outs . 
  here is the thing only 4 nations have opt outs . 
  uk has 4 opt outs , denmark has 3 opt outs , ireland has 2 opt outs and poland has 1 opt out . 
  thats it no other nation has any opt outs . 
  the only opt out you 're not having that someone else has is the `` common security and defence policy '' that denmark is not participating in . 
  you 're not even forced into the common asylum policy , the refugee crisis has nothing to do with the eu rules for you . 
  but you guys would n't want to join the eea , it includes the free movement of persons ( i.e right for those dirty eastern europeans to come work in your country ), 
  you guys already have an opt out on all fucking refugee shit , you want another refugee opt out ? 
  of course its a compromise , everything that comes from brussels is pretty much a compromise . 
  but when it is as watered down as this its pretty much useless . 
  the stability pact was pretty much worthless since any infraction passes the commission and then the council . 
  generally infractions against eu-directives and treaties go to the eu-court . 
  but since this one goes through the council and the commission concerns ended up thrown out . 
  why anyone expected the members states to jointly make sure this was followed strikes me as insane . 
  rather the whole purpose for not handing this responsibility to the courts was that the member states feared actually handing away the control over their budgets and ensuring it was followed . 
  arguably it was never intended to be followed strictly . 
  the moment its enforcement was politicized it turned into nothing more than toilet paper . 
  there 's only 2 countries that actually are n't currently being marked as excessive deficit , sweden and estonia . 
  arguably greece does n't meet the standards of safe country considering 'm . s.s. 
  v. belgium and greece ' which pretty much means that we ca n't send refugees back to greece if they get to another eu nation even if they are registered in greece . 
  ah no , looking at it i think i opened the comment thread pre-edit then took up that tab again after your edit without updating the thread , that or i replied to the wrong comment . 
  sweden received 10k asylum seekers just during last week and thats just the ones who register . 
  sweden has had the highest amount of asylum seekers per capita for several years within the eu , i 'd argue there 's room for very serious concern at least . 
  ah no , i 'm not objecting . 
  the echr is objectively correct in their judgement . 
  i just find it amusing that so many people argue how turkey should be considered a ` safe country ' but meanwhile a eu country does n't even meet the standard . 
  the european court of human rights already did , 'm . s.s v belgium and greece ' back in january 2011 . 
  belgium was convicted for sending back refugees that were registered in greece . 
  greece was convicted for not giving people a fair judgement on the rulings of their asylum case if i remember correctly + some other shit . 
  thats what i was refering to , we already do n't send refugees back to greece within the eu . 
   after about 10 years in sweden , around 50 % of immigrants have found jobs . 
  its 50 % after 7 years and 60 % after 15years thereafter there is no real increase . 
  it is n't considered a safe country but the eu-commission tried in september/october to get eu as a whole to declare it as such but failed . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/news/junckers-eu-common-list-safe-countries-origin-raises-questions ) there are 4 criterias a country must fulfill to be considered a safe country . 
  no persecution 2 . 
  no torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 3 . 
  no threat of violence 4 . 
  no armed conflict, 
  greece is n't even considered a safe country anymore its almost amusing . 
  we start learning english immediately in school then in 6th grade you choose 1 of the 3 electives spanish , french and german . 
  i believe spanish is the most popular nowadays . 
  in high school you either continue with the language you had already started on or pick up another . 
  most high schools only offer the same 3 languages but some do offer others . 
  yeah , i suspected that since it was directed to a swedish audience only the norwegian and english parts are real of the foreign languages since you can expect 100 % of swedes to understand those languages . 
  [ vaskduellen ! / the vask duel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhepmj3n_wu ) you can turn on english annotations they are decent at least ( vaska is waste in this translation ), 
  how does a strike in greece put pressure on creditors . 
  the only thing it achieves is screwing the gov on growth and taxes making the situation worse for themself . 
  syriza wants demonstration against syrizas own government ? 
  c definitely wo n't follow m on this , kd most likely will and fp is a toss-up . 
  m + kd + sd wo n't be enough either you need more than 1 more party joining of the remainder of the alliance and the only potential one is fp unless s kicks mp out of the government and starts working with m on this . 
   lebanon or turkey or jordan none of them are classified as safe third countries by european nations . 
  thus greece and italy has been the safe third countries in this case and thats where the collapse has been . 
  there are discussions to try and classify turkey as a safe country but it has n't been done yet, 
  could i have a source on that ? 
  most of sweden is forest and woodland . 
  so of course a lot of people that come here are gon na end up in the middle of the forest . 
  if you did n't want forests you could 've stopped in denmark . 
  wrong , the left choose to walk out . 
  there was also no agreement for increased welfare for refugees . 
  there was an agreement to leviate the costs for the municipalities . 
  they are just moving some of the costs to the state from what the municipalities usually cover . 
  the pm himself says there 's been discussions with juncker and tusk . 
  personally i doubt he 'd go out and declare something as big as this without having secured some support from some others . 
  correction except two parties . 
  the left party walked out when they did n't get their way ( keeping the status quo ) so neither them nor sd are part of the agreement . 
  also you are misunderstanding the 54k , thats the number of refugees they want to transfer to other countries . 
  demands might be a tad bit strong but our prime minister has gone out and commented it in a interview . 
  the wording used at that interview would probably be closest to `` strongly requests . '', 
  i did n't watch the press conference so i ca n't comment on the wording used there . 
  since its the final session we should just run till either to few players are left or the host ( you i wager ) has to go . 
  close enough, 
  yeni anadolu or whatever the hell rhak named my colonial nation will be there . 
  turkstraylia will be in attendance, 
  the grand vizier shall make sure that the greatest empire under the heavens continues to prosper and spread the glory of god to all corners of the world . 
  you can just make a copy and save onto your own account , i did n't make the first version either . 
  i wo n't be participating for the next couple of weekends anyway . 
  if any new player wants to grab manchu i 'd say its in a pretty decent spot although currently at war with ming but ming is at 0 manpower and you 've still got quite some reserves left . 
  and if you beat ming there 's no real threat left in east asia since japs collapsed . 
  could crosspost r/eu4 rather , i know arath did that to get more players last time , which ended up with us having over 50 players . 
  besides most people tend to sign up on saturday in my experience . 
  set one up [ here ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lnwee6p9tbjciuoqpcoyj1tnaznqmcze58evzp6pawo/edit?usp=sharing ) , also included / u/czokletmuss claim to poland since he called dibs on it in the end thread of the last playthrough . 
  by that virtue no non-eu state is in the single market . 
  eea is also `` just access '' . 
  regardless there is no customs border between swiss and eu . 
  aside from that as the 4 freedoms apply to eea and switzerland they can indeed also be said to be within the single market .

  so far this kind of violence has not been increasing very rapidly in sweden against foreigners , although we had our share of asylum center burnings last year . 
  depressing . 
  go further . 
  there 's no reason to have a car in most modern cities with a well-developed public transit system , especially one like paris with its legendary metro . 
  if there are further needs in terms of buses or metro stations , then invest in those to build it out even more . 
  paris also has a relatively mild climate , so winter problems with snow etc are far less of an issue than in , say , the nordic countries . 
  i guess evs would be better , but even evs pollute ( the tires ) . 
  why not make a lot of bicycle paths all over the city ? 
  this car fetish is unhealthy and unnecessary . 
  people are too inactive as it is . 
  the average car journey in most cities in america was something like 3 km iirc , and american cities as a general rule tend to have less built-out public transit transportation systems than in europe . 
  it 's long past time to stop dithering and start pushing public transport not as * a * solution but as * the * solution to inner-city transportation . 
   could n't help be be fascinated  gray communist era structures well , there 's someone for anything , i guess . 
  i can also safely assure you that your love of grey commie blocks is probably extremely unrepresentative . 
  i further guess you probably already know that . 
   i 'm not a beach person anyway bless your soul . 
  we need more people like that . 
  getting skin cancer is very glorified for all the wrong reasons . 
  i know that everyone loves a chance to pile on johnson , but please . 
  boris is acting on behalf of may , who is trying to get excemptions to the ffs in order to get access to the single market . 
  it is unlikely to succeed but she is trying - as she should . 
  sch\u00e4uble knows this , too , yet he can not resist to play stupid and pass up a chance to melodramatically lecture johnson . 
  as an arch-federalist , it 's easy to see the schadenfreude that he must feel over attacking the person perhaps most responsible for brexit . 
  but we should n't pretend both men do n't know what they 're doing . 
  i get that boris is public enemy # 1 in / r/europe but this is silly . 
  context , folks . 
  the argument that `` well those other cities have shit areas too '' is n't compelling . 
  brussels is n't an attractive city . 
  a city is more than its architecture . 
  let 's get real , it 's a concrete jungle . 
  the old town is tiny . 
  it has nothing on budapest or prague and the old paintings of warsaw show that it was just as beautiful , maybe even more . 
  on the other hand , given the tourism invasion of cities like prague , having a lot of commie blocks might even be a blessing in disguise . 
  i 've heard from some people in amsterdam that there are areas there where people do n't even talk dutch anymore , it 's all english due to all the expats . 
  you walk into a shop , they ca n't speak dutch . 
  you order a beer , they ca n't speak dutch . 
  of course then there 's [ barcelona ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdxcfchrpmi ) . 
  do n't worry , he acts like one . 
  we saw these same explanations from a lot of people in the wake of the attacks against poles , too . 
  it was just chavs/cunts , we were told , nothing racial . 
  we saw how long that lasted . 
  it 's possible this time is different . 
  it 's also possible it is n't . 
  francisco franco died more than four decades ago but the censorship imposed by the spanish dictator lives on in dozens of works by writers such as ernest hemingway , george orwell , james baldwin and ian fleming . 
  according to new research , modern classics that were censored at the time of the dictatorship are still available in spain only in the version approved by franco 's regime . 
  in many cases , that means they appear without references to the spanish civil war or to franco himself , and are stripped of phrases and passages deemed too sexually explicit , critical of the church or immoral by the standards of the regime at the time . 
  some spanish translations appear with whole pages from the original simply cut out . 
  james bond , the womanising spy at the heart of ian fleming 's fiction series , suffered particularly gravely at the hands of franco 's censors . 
  many of his graphic sexual exploits -- in books such as dr no and thunderball -- are missing from the spanish versions of the books even today . 
  in the case of hemingway 's across the river and into the trees , even recent spanish editions include a string of changes made by the censors . 
  a reference to `` lesbians '' in the original text translates as `` good friends '' in the current spanish hardback edition . 
  a reference to `` general fat ass franco '' in the english text appears as the unspecific `` general asno gordo '' ( or fat donkey ) in the latest paperback version from 2001 . 
  coarse language and hemingwayesque insults such as `` son of a bitch '' are toned down throughout the text . 
  `` this is a legacy of the franco regime that is somehow invisible . 
  it is there but readers do n't know about it , '' said jordi cornella , a lecturer in hispanic studies at glasgow university . 
  `` censorship disappeared after franco -- but not the effect of the censors . '' a reference to `` general fat ass franco '' [ in hemingway 's across the river and into the trees ] appears as the unspecific `` general asno gordo '' ( or fat donkey ) in the latest paperback version from 2001 . 
  mr cornella first realised that current spanish editions continued to be laced with such bowdlerisation while analysing the translation of bond novels . 
  `` the last chapter of dr no was totally distorted because they took out a couple of pages with sexual references . 
  i thought this must be a mistake but then i started researching and found other examples , '' he said . 
  `` the problem now is that these versions appear even in ebooks , so you can say that censorship is still alive and well in spain . '' mr cornella says he has so far documented censorship in dozens of books , in multiple post-franco editions , from george orwell 's burmese days and james baldwin 's another country to ira levin 's rosemary 's baby . 
  works by john dos passos , muriel spark and dashiell hammett are also affected . 
  according to mr cornella , publishers are often not even aware their books are compromised . 
  `` this has nothing to do with ideology . 
  it happens either because of financial reasons or because they simply do n't know that the text they have has been censored , '' he said . 
  a spokeswoman for planeta , which published the most recent editions of across the river and into the trees , said the group had been unaware of the censorship changes at the time of publication , adding that it no longer held the rights to the work . 
  `` with this new information , any self-respecting publisher will be delighted to issue a new version , '' she said , adding that planeta had recently released new censorship-free editions of works by writers such as carlos fuentes and juan mars\u00e9 . 
  franco 's rule over spain lasted from the end of the civil war in 1939 until his death in 1975 . 
  over that period , close to 500,000 books were published in spain , all of which had to pass the censors . 
  according to mr cornella , it is unclear how many of these works were in fact cut or changed , and how many of these changes are still in use in contemporary editions . 
  spanish democracy has long passed its infancy , but , as mr cornella remarks , `` books have a very long life '' . 
  this is n't necessarily bad . 
  the derivates market is one giant buzzsaw of trouble . 
  some people claim to be able to understand it to regulate it . 
  they 're lying to you . 
  warren buffet called them weapons of financial mass destruction . 
  at any rate , it is good for the uk to re-balance its economy from being so heavily biased towards financial services . 
  osborne talked loosely about going for more manufacturing but he was always too wedded to the old financial elites to really move the needle . 
  may has been much more interesting , endorsing the kind of worker-industrial nexus that germany and the nordics are famous for , like mandating workers ' representatives on company boards of directors . 
  something which the previous ( pre-corbyn ) labour manifesto deemed as too radical , has now been adopted by the conservatives . 
  interesting times indeed . 
  i , for one , hope that the brits have the guts to follow through . 
  london will always be an important financial center , but it would do good to the british economy to diversify . 
  it would also de-risk it in case of a recession , as having large amounts of massive banks in your economy means you are more vulnerable . 
  you 're missing the point i was making . 
  i 'm not saying sweden is pioneering crispr-cas9 , i 'm saying it is willing to go where others are not willing to go , in the name of progress . 
  that 's why we pioneered the racial-eugenics institute , because racial eugenics was all the rage 100 years ago . 
  it was also somewhat controversial back then . 
  talking loosely of racial genetic differences in research papers is one thing , actually setting up a dedicated research institute and bringing in people from all over europe to study is quite another . 
  i drew the comparison to swedes being very quick on trends overall . 
  whether those trends are social or technological is immaterial , it 's the principle that counts . 
  i was putting this decision in context of our national culture . 
  calculated bs to siphon off votes from wilders . 
  after election , back to status quo . 
  fyi , sweden has had a long history of being willing to experiment with genetics . 
  uppsala university had the world 's first racial-biological institute . 
  today the building has been re-christened and most people are not aware of its history . 
  it is n't like we are nefarious , it 's just that we are often at the frontiers of science and willing to experiment . 
  sweden was famous among american consumer companies in the 50s for being extremely quick to adopt new technological trends . 
  we did n't have any traditional culture to speak of and just took to adopting new stuff very quickly . 
  it 's the same with internet usage , we went all in very early on when a lot of people still doubted it in the early 90s .

  i also think a lot of care is being taken by foresters for biodiversity and so on , at least compared to other countries , they leave some old trees to rot for insects and stuff like that , even in the plantations . 
  or leave a few trees standing in clear cuts , ca n't remember why , but i think that 's a similar thing . 
  and probably other things too that might not be common in other places . 
  spoken like a true russian . 
   or the winter war which they lost ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_peace_treaty, 
  apparently they do , and since both sweden and finland are mostly covered in what 's essentially tree plantations , it gets a bit weird , and they should have really thought about that , one would think ... we 're down there with madagascar and indonesia . 
  oh fuck off edit : heh , someone did as i told them , that 's a new one ... 
  that 's a completely worthless statistic for countries with big forest industries . 
  we 've been cutting down our forests for hundreds of years , but we have also been replanting them all since like the early 20th century . 
  so it really does n't matter from an environmentalist perspective if we cut a lot of them down or not , they are all getting replanted either way . 
  it might be economically worrying though , if farmers need to cut down their trees early that can have consequences later down the line , but i doubt that 's the case . 
  --  boreal countries have suffered forest loss as well in recent years . 
  russia and canada are among the top three countries with the greatest gross annual tree cover loss in 2014 . 
  timber and other commercial enterprises drive much of the tree removal , yet the bulk of loss in these regions is due to forest fires . 
  these fires worsen in extent and intensity as temperatures in the northern latitudes rise and drier conditions prevail , with effects closely linked to global climate change . 
  is all i can find about the region and that does n't work on finland or sweden ( still few fires here afaik ) . 
  i really have a hard time taking the rest of the data seriously when they suggest that we have an issue with tree cover loss . 
  how sloppy are the rest of the results then ? 
  ( that i know less about ) actually , even for russia and canada , are they implying that those forests are gone for good just because there was a forest fire there ? 
  they will obviously grow back , what 's the actual issue ? 
  -- it 's a bit like measuring how many crops gets harvested each year in france and somehow linking that to farmland disappearing ... 
  what , russia ? 
  tax money is what most europeans use , especially when talking about another country . 
   ( is it realy not allowed to marry before the age of 18 in sweden ? ), 
  it used to be possible with a special permission from the county board , but that option is now removed and it is now completely impossible . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snapphane maybe not a proper civil war , it was more of a resistance to occupation , but it definitely has some civil war features . 
  pro-danish guerilla rising up against the swedish state . 
  the swedes `` solved '' it by [ playing a bit with the danish army ( and the dutch ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_lund ) , killing ( and torturing ) all the rebels they could catch , turning the population against them to catch the rest , and then some good old ethnic cleansing when things had calmed down a bit to stop further troubles . 
  which is why i speak swedish now , and not just east danish ( well , that 's part of the reason anyway ) . 
  do n't think that would work as well in a modern setting though , more likely to just cause even more conflict . 
  and you know , ethnic cleansing as a concept is something most people want to stay away from as much as possible . 
   plus it 's about time you get into the invading/colonizing business . 
  yeah , all the big brothers has already got theirs over with , it 's your turn now finland !, 
  there are plenty of similar companies around , but straight out putting one of the worlds biggest companies out of business is going to be difficult unless they really screw something up . 
  that 's just google translate . 
  literally translated from swedish it would be `` alone-coming children '', 
   where do they live ? 
  who takes care of them ? 
  who is responsible for them ? 
  special housing in each municipality . 
  people hired by the municipality . 
  the municipality/government . 
   23,000 minors mostly abusing heroin . 
  yeah , literally dozens of them so far ... actually , the article does n't say . 
  they arrested `` ett tiotal '' last week , roughly translated to `` a dozen '' / dozens . 
  the only other number it gives is that that was more than they arrested in all of 2015 , and that the dealers are apparently focusing on the afghan youth now ( according to an informant/someone ) . 
   it seems to me as an american that to europeans anyone who wants a homogenous country is considered `` racist '' by european media i also hate the overuse of `` racism '' by people nowadays . 
  but `` wanting a homogenous country '' is like ... how do i put this without offending you ? 
  a bit too much like early 20th century europe . 
  you 're probably fine , but without expanding on it further than that and people will automatically assume the worst . 
   if the polls show 20 % support for that party , then some people in media and government would take notice and start reflecting some of those views , but they do n't . 
  they have changed . 
  a few years ago something like border checks would have been unimaginable , but we have them now . 
  but nothing radical has been done by the government , so you guys who only hang out in here or international media rarely hears about it . 
  and there is plenty of criticism against the governments immigration policies in media , anyone who claims otherwise are just ignorant . 
  but the news-reporting itself is usually done in a very `` neutral '' way , which means it basically has the angle that people expect it to have , which is slightly pro-government . 
  if you want to read criticism go into political columns and stuff . 
  and in the other germanic languages , who already uses it but with a slightly less obnoxious spelling . 
   there are no poor swedes ? 
  there are no swedes living in absolute poverty , that 's the whole point of a welfare society . 
  for relative poverty , sure . 
  but most `` poor '' people here are immigrants . 
  that is one of the more worrying things about this whole mass-immigration thing , the divides it creates in our society . 
   nor any other nationalities . 
  there are plenty of nationalities represented on that list , including native swedes . 
   and none of them on that list there is one pole on that list . 
  http://www.interpol.int/notice/search/wanted/2016-4948 that 's one out of 47 people on the list . 
  if that would follow the populations in the country it would correspond to about 210000 people , that 's almost twice as many poles than there are in sweden . 
  i would also like to point out that for anyone to be considered `` poor '' in sweden you would need to be unemployed , as our equivalent to minimum wage allows us to live very comfortably . 
  that rules out most poles who usually come here for work . 
  obviously a lot of poles here work `` under the table '' ( hope that 's the right english term ) , and thus do n't follow the minimum wage thing , but still , at least they have work . 
   that we ca n't connect crime with ethnical background no , but we can connect lower socioeconomic status with immigrants . 
  and we can connect immigration with non-native ethnical backgrounds ( obviously ) . 
  and we can also connect lower socioeconomic status with crime . 
  so as long as you do it that way it 's fine . 
  immigrants -  poverty -  crime the problem is only when you jump directly from crime to ethnicities . 
  keep that in mind and it will keep you from getting called racist as much . 
  i think it 's a mostly useless statistic . 
  what exactly are we supposed to gain from knowing that ? 
  ethnicity is an inherently subjective thing , can any actually scientific conclusions be drawn from that ? 
  if not , why should our government care about it at all ? 
  but at the same time , i do n't see any particularly overwhelming reason to ban the state from asking about it in a census , i just doubt the usefulness of it . 
   actually , the `` pizza sallad '' came along together with the jugoslavians that came to sweden in the 70 : s . that makes so much sense since pretty much every pizza shop here is run by immigrants . 
  ah , okey , did n't get that . 
  we like to help people . 
  we 're also fairly naive , living in our own little bubble up here in scandinavia . 
  and as someone else pointed out , we took in similar amounts of refugees in the 90s from former yugoslavia when you guys were at it . 
  that crisis was over relatively quickly though , the current one might be troublesome if it continues for much longer . 
  300 billion divided by 10 million is 30 000 , not 10 000 individual income tax is not the only revenue our government has . 
  so saying it will be like a 2-3 % increase in taxes is not true . 
  but i see your point . 
  i just wanted to point out that our math was wrong , that is all , just failed to do that apparently , sorry . 
  you can look at the yugoslavs coming to sweden in the 90s . 
   or that that they get more money from social welfare than working . 
  they wo n't , unless the employer breaks the `` law '' . 
  ( technically not a law , but might as well be ), 
   there is absolutely zero chance that the refugees will be assimilated into productive members of swedish society , at least not in the first 20 years . 
  it 's been about 20 years since the wave of immigration here from former yugoslavia . 
  most of them have been assimilated fine . 
  people said the same thing as you back in the 90s when i was growing up .

  the map you yourself provided proves the opposite !, 
  cute , i could turn that around and say that you should look at egypt . 
  you 're just trying a bad attempt at ` whataboutism ' . 
  you should look at the links you provide before submitting them , like this map on prevalence , now go and look on the countries were the prevalence is the highest , and also , while you 're at it look whether the counties with lesser prevalence has sizeable muslim minorities ; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/female_genital_mutilation#mediaviewer/file:fgm_in_africa.svg likewise , i know facts wo n't convince you since you are probably so doctrinaire that people might take you for a living joke . 
  i dare you to compare the prevalence of fgm between christian and muslim countries . 
  yeah , and our elites can go back to discussing the important stuff , issues like gender neutral daycare centres , or gender neutral words . 
  they like to fight the good fight . 
  oh you mean letting southern europe of the hook in order for them to continue functioning like third world countries ? 
  how about no . 
  oddly enough i do n't see the usual relativists that we see at r/sweden here . 
  this is a bunch of somalians who are doing their standard cultural practises . 
  swedish media will bend over backwards in the days to come to relativize this , or ignore it completely , nothing in-between . 
  this since to suggest that stone age somali `` culture '' should be curtailed is akin to being racist in this country . 
  yey multiculturalism !, 
  no , its not irrelevant , if you want to do an international comparison the terrible categories that the migrationboard uses are useless . 
  do remember that they kinda use an honour system were they ( incredible as it sounds ) uses a kind of `` trust system '' were if a person says that he is from say afghanistan they actually go by what he stays , rather than investigating it , this is the `` synnerligen \u00f6mmande omst\u00e4ndigheter '' and `` skyddsbeh\u00f6vande '' by in large . 
  hence those categories are nothing but dumb constructions to conceal the problems . 
  no its not , if a syrian has the money to go here he is not the one in need , not at all , rather he is in the upper classes . 
  some got sentences , but seeing as our justice system is in shambles it was a slap on the wrist at best . 
  again , you are trying to scew the issue , that table is irrelevant . 
  if we look at last year about 110 k persons immigrated , of these about 10-15 % were refugees in accordance with the un criterias . 
  most relatives arent from from syria , but rather somalia , that is n't a warzone anymore , it actually ash a government et.al now . 
  no we dont need to take those , we have no obligation to . 
  as for syrians , those are the part of our quota refugees . 
  you make it seem that all of the immigration is related to refugees , it is not . 
  the amount of actual refugees account for about 10-15 % of the total immigration on a yearly basis , not the lot of it like you make it out to be . 
  yeah i am , there is no reason to multiply immigration by that extent , we also do n't have any obligation to allow these people in , or any obligation to pay for them . 
  a mixture of denial , being naive in general and in part to blame it on the majority society via faire tales of `` structural discrimination '' . 
  this in a country with some of the most generous social welfare benefits available , i.e. 
  they are marginalized by choice . 
  this is their way to `` wage war '' against the majority society , just like the do in the banlieues around paris , or the suburbs of london , there is nothing more to it . 
  well that 's a load of shit if i ever saw it . 
  why do n't you bring forth the `` anh\u00f6righetsinvandring '' , the zisable part of economic migrants , the fact that the migrationboard do n't have an acceptable background check , or how grown men are supposed to be `` youth '' et.al ? 
  i honestly ca n't give a complete answer . 
  i would say that it is because of the fact that the people in charge never really faces the reality , rather they all , along with media et.al . 
  live in a geographical and socially confined area , in which separate norms have developed . 
  it is like dealing with a bunch of zealots . 
  neither can a lot of us who live here ... 
  oh please , the sweden democrats are comparable to csu , pp and unp in terms of politics . 
  the article is sensationalized . 
  i 'm not advocating any cluster-fuck society like the us , rather a moderation of the all encompassing welfare state . 
  this is also something that is supported by the swedish public , that work should pay of simply put . 
  likewise free choice is appreciated . 
  well i dunno if i want to be flanked by you people , but if we somehow can get finland , vorpommern and livland we have a deal . 
  begs to differ ; http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21571136-politicians-both-right-and-left-could-learn-nordic-countries-next-supermodel, 
  this a first place i 'm very happy to hand over to you dear neighbours . 
  stability the same way north korea is stabile , does n't make soviet society any more legitimate in the eyes of the citizens in occupied states , such as estonia . 
  also , almost every good that came out of the soviet union was an inferior good ( to use macro lterms ) , from the stuff in grocery shops to the way of government , virtually everything was an inferior good that the citizens wanted to replace with the western version . 
   being in the soviet sphere of influence also had positives , like what ? 
  it does n't . 
  also , it omits how of the subs was n't completely straight , lol .

  just like cameron has made clear no one has elected junker to anything . 
  why the **** would anyone choose such a divisive figure as head of the ec ? 
  just look at his track record handling the ez crisis , he did n't exactly show much leadership qualities . 
  people should , especially since it the only state that has ( in real terms ) completed the austerity programme and actually done what it was supposed to . 
  yes , i agree that the state had its problems , but the groundwork were there , this both in influence from near states , and importantly ireland had both a civil society and a political culture that was able to grasp the need for change , and adopt it . 
  i am very sceptical , if it actually worked most of the times it would n't be such a contentious point , but it does not , and a host of the aid goes to letting farmers and fishermen pretend that it is still the 1920 's or structural funds that builds roads , railways or docks were not needed . 
  add to this that the inner market still does n't work in regards to public tenders et.al . 
  i do n't think most of us see the benefit at all , me included . 
  that is true , thanks for pointing it out , i completely forgot the best ( and one of very few ) example of when eu-policies actually works , ireland that is . 
  in the case of ireland though the structure in civil society , political culture et.al . 
  was there from the get go , it only needed a long push . 
  this is sadly not the case in the states i mentioned . 
  lol , a greek mouthing of about riots is hilarious . 
  why do n't you focus on exarchia and omonia and then come back . 
  a larger state has a larger gdp , this is as new and interesting as the fact that the sun is hot . 
  if you look at the relevant index , you 'll find spain on place 36 , just behind bahrain , slightly ahead of kuwait . 
  look a bit further down still and you 'll find italy . 
  nope , its just the harsh truth , have a look yourself about ( edit : note that the link to economic facts goes to a huge pdf ) [ economic competitiveness ] ( http://www3.weforum.org/docs/wef_globalcompetitivenessreport_2012-13.pdf ) or [ corruption ] ( http://www.transparency.org/country ) . 
  i could go on and spam different indexes , reports and such , but cba . 
  the balkan states are the perfect example of states that does not learn ( bar slovenia , and croatia ) . 
  these states just use the language of change , as a means to an end . 
  their political culture , view of institutions , view of the states role in society , civil society et.al . 
  does not change through the prospect of eu-membership , or actual eu-membership . 
  they view the eu as a cash cow , you 'll see this if you look at bulgarian and greek politicians , who dress their speeches in eu-language as a vehicle for their own special interests , but still wo n't do anything when the eu is n't looking . 
  this also applies to spain . 
  the eu has learned nothing . 
  it has never worked before . 
  still today spain and greece are near banana-republics , italy is ungovernable , and they all are corrupt on a level close to african states . 
  the only success stories we got are the baltic 's , and some central european states , all states that desperately wished to return to their historical `` neighbourhood '' and hence did what they were supposed to . 
  to incorporate a state built on etno-religious tensions reflected in teh constitution such as bosnia , a mafia state like albania ( and montenegro for that matter ) , a failed state run by organ runners , like kosovo , or a state at odds with every neighbour , like macedonia seems like a joke . 
  it is not beneficial at all , the eu ca n't even get long term members to reform , and to be brutally honest , the flood of gypsies from romania and bulgaria that litter virtually every major european city today will be much , much worse are these countries to join . 
  add to this criminal organizations form the balkans et.al . 
  just no . 
  why are close to failed states like bosnia , albania and macedonia even being considered , did the eu learn nothing from bulgaria and romania ? 
  yeah , the cap , regional funds and whatnot would surely have prevented this . 
  * `` russians in kazakhstan , the baltic states , and even lowly moldova encounter daily hostility , paying for decisions the soviet union made without consulting them as it played great-power politics . 
  this article is just a bad kremlin propaganda piece . 
  i do n't think it is , this years group is slanted towards the republicans , who are poised to win enough races to take the senate , even with tea party challengers making the races more uncertain than usual . 
   probably around the time sweden joins oh , you mean you 're never gon na join . 
  * `` the programme , which will fund additional us military rotations to europe , will need congressional approval . 
  '' * well come the midterms and this will never happen , when the gop gets both houses . 
  this is just an empty promise by obama .

  10 % is a very high number already , that 's 2.5 x overrepresentation . 
  anyone who claims that this is an economic win are deluding themselves , especially as more and more low-skill jobs are being turned over to robots . 
  i ask again : why ca n't europe learn from australia and canada who understood decades ago that high levels of immigration can only work if you take in people who are well educated ( and thus can integrate fast ) as well as socially [ tolerant to women and gays ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/no-safe-asylum-for-female-refugees-in-europe/a-18775017 ) ? 
  this is not surprising . 
  svt , the swedish version of the bbc , claimed that 37 % of syrians are highly educated . 
  the reality ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.tino.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/syrien.png ) . 
  that graph comes from scb - our main statistics agency . 
  around 10 % have a 3 + year bachelor 's degree . 
  svt got to 37 % by including people who have done 1 or 2 years in a work-school , like for a hairstylist for example or a plumber . 
  if you done even 6 months more than high-school , you are `` highly educated '' . 
  but in reality , it 's around 10 % . 
  and that 's assuming that a ) these people are all telling the truth , which we ca n't verify and b ) that the education that they got was actually relevant to a high-functioning society . 
  i do n't know about the universities of syria but i do n't think it would shock anyone if their standards were very low . 
  i do n't think that poland was exceptional during wwii , but i do n't think you can make an argument that it was doing a lot worse than western european states ( the dutch in particular were all-too-happy in collaborating with the nazi authorities ) . 
  and poland is often singled out , while many west european states are left out , which i find curious and noteworthy . 
  i 'm not ignoring it , i 'm ridiculing it . 
  let me explain it to you , slowly . 
  these people may not seek financial aid from the government but they are going to use social services nonetheless . 
  or are you telling me that they are going to die instead of getting help if they get seriously sick ? 
  and where will they live ? 
  do you really not think that there are unscrupolous landlords willing to exploit them , which would be compounded by the fact that even less room is available for citizens . 
  the bottomline is that these people cost money even if they are illegal and many of them are not refugees but economic migrants . 
  why should the swedish taxpayer subsidise them ? 
  only if you believe in open borders , like you and maximumleng seem to do , is this justified . 
  the problem is that the majority of the swedish population does not . 
  and it is * they * who are footing the bill . 
   ** undocumented ** immigrants nice try , bro , nice try . 
  by the way , just to underline a point in the article : the swedish police estimates that for every asylum seeker there is one more person who goes underground . 
  note : this is * not * people who apply , get denied , and who are then going underground . 
  no , these people go underground right away . 
  we 're not talking about 10 % of the total asylum seeking population . 
  no ; we 're talking about one-for-one . 
  so if you think sweden are taking in massive amounts of asylum seekers right now , just remember that the reality is closer to 2x because the official statistics do n't count half the shadow population . 
  these people are n't going to get deported in the overwhelming amount of cases , even if they get found . 
  the former migration minister , tobias billstr\u00f6m , conceded as much in one of his final interviews . 
   sweden have lost all control over illegal immigrants . 
  they come and go and act as they wish . 
  do n't blame the migrants . 
  if you or i were in their position we 'd do the exact same thing as they . 
  let 's be real . 
  i know i would . 
  if i came from a god-forsaken 3rd world nation in the middle of nowhere and a rich country with very generous welfare offers me a lifetime of benefits and financial support with high levels of safety , why would n't i ? 
  the issue is the leadership in sweden , the spinelessness of the population and the supplicant nature of the bootlicking media which has almost no independent voice whatsoever on mass migration . 
  blaming the migrants for doing the rational choice ( from their pov ) is pointless and self-defeating . 
  it 's also easy , because these people ca n't really defend themselves in the general culture . 
  their representation is weak to non-existent . 
  and it lets those responsible off the hook . 
   just as they lived back home , sans all the bombs and killings . 
  except that a lot of people coming now are n't even from syria ( even if syria is the single biggest arrival country ) . 
  so your propaganda about war is patently false for a lot of them . 
  which of course introduces the follow-up question : do you believe in open borders ? 
  because your comment certainly suggests so , and i 'd like to know . 
  your total relaxation about the break-down of any reasonable immigration control in sweden is quite remarkable . 
  that 's true , the notion that the people who are coming are not counted is false . 
  in many ways this is actually more damning because you ca n't fake ignorance or incompetence when people ask why this sudden surge is coming . 
  `` oh i had no * idea * this many came ! '' . 
  wo n't work . 
   forcing brussels to make `` an explicit statement '' that britain will be kept out of any move towards a european superstate . 
  this will require an exemption for the uk from the eu 's founding principle of `` ever closer union '' . 
  this is never going to happen . 
  the whole * point * of the eu is `` ever closer union '' . 
  if you do n't want that then you do n't want to be inside the eu . 
  look , negotiations are always about having maximalist positions and then as they drag on , the two sides try to find common ground . 
  so i get why he goes for these outlandish positions in the first place . 
  the problem for him , politically , is that now that the list is leaked , this will be the benchmark that the uk public will hold him to . 
  if he comes back whimping from brussels with a completely different set of concessions , his reputation and credibility will be in tatters and the pro-independence side will have won the argument easily , as they will paint him as a sellout who ca n't keep his word . 
  and they 'll be objectively right . 
  because the list is never going to win any votes now or in the future , it 's a total non-starter . 
  calling innocent victims massacred in a peaceful democratic gathering as `` provocateurs '' shows that if erdogan does n't immediatedly denounce this minister , he is implicitly agreeing with every single word of it . 
  it would also strip off the very last veneer of turkey 's democratic patina . 
  not surprised to see sweden being the most tolerant of everyone but the christians . 
  iirc , there have been survey 's in the past asking people in various european countries if they 'd be comfortable living with people from other ethnicities . 
  just 6 % of swedes said no ( in germany , 20 % said no ) . 
  the same is true when they asked bosses in various european countries , who 'd they 'd hire etc. 
  again sweden out on top . 
  overall , sweden is indeed the most tolerant nation in the world - and we 're about to find out how well that will go over the next few decades . 
  it even needs its own thread to be investigated !, 
  maybe he should try begging without the disguise and see if everyone greets him with a smile and showers him with money . 
  i 'm afraid mr. s\u00f6derstr\u00f6m is going to be sorely disappointed . 
  orban is n't for * leftist open-borders * inspired ideals . 
  that 's not the same thing as western . 
  but he cares deeply about european culture . 
  erdogan and the gang have nothing in common with us . 
   their problems are our problems . 
  this is so hilarious . 
  the so-called white turks are beloved in the eu capitals for a reason . 
  and hated and despised by their countrymen for the same reason . 
   i think countries like albania are much better for muslim immigrants . 
  i do n't . 
  have you ever been to albania ? 
  they are very secular in their habits . 
  they have more in common with christian europeans than with fundamentalist muslims from the middle east . 
   so do you class all european christians as culturally indistinguishable ? 
  he never said that and you know that perfectly well . 
  why are you trying to deny that christianity was shaped by europe to a decive extent and islam was n't at all ? 
  by the way , there are various ethnicities in europe , too , who 's to say anything such as `` european '' even exists ? 
  why are you even on here ? 
  see how dumb that kind of `` logic '' becomes . 
  do better .

  or 2016 , or ... think of ddr/brd . 
  ddr were far less productive ( to say the least ) and they had the d-mark . 
  to offset that , germany made investments of * trillions * , but also kept their social system going , health care , schools etc. 
  24 years after the reuninon , ddr is still after west germany . 
  i mean , one ca n't expect greece et al to become as productive as the north ( since the currency is suited to them ) in less than two decades or maybe three . 
  true , they are not ddr , obviously , but they are not receiving any social transfers or investment , only debt and austerity . 
  so , if the cure take three decades - will greece still live then ? 
   it was n't because of the inflation paranoia and paranoid attitude of some rich countries . 
  the euro crisis basically ended when draghi said : `` the ecb will do anything necessary to keep the euro afloat '' . 
  at that point stability returned . 
  ahem , how is the crises ended when the ez has enormous unemployment , no rules , growth problems , huge debt and heading into japan territory . 
  thanks for the correction . 
  but , only former `` eastern '' ( that might be a bit wide ) countries that frankly has a low gdp projects a decent growth . 
  i am fascinated by the fact that the eurozone ignores numbers like this . 
  i wonder for how many years . 
  i think it interesting that no ez country apart from latvia and estonia is projected to have a growth above 1,9 % , while sweden , denmark , poland , the uk and almost all other eastern european countries are . 
  should n't this finally tell the ez that they are in a deep , deep trouble and should act ? 
  or does people in the ez belive this is just a complete accident , and will change in 2015 ? 
  and , swedens debt/gdp is below 40 , i belive it is 37 % . 
  no , sweden only have sd or the left , which is the former communist party , if you want to vote against the eu in sweden . 
  and they are again , very mild for european standards , it is not far right . 
  and they do n't mind gays or samis , at least not what i 've heard . 
  it is possible that they might disagree with the sami about something , but frankly , half of sweden does that . 
  that is not equivalent to being right wing . 
  i do that , i question the fact that we are not allowed to have wolfes , lynx , bear etc in any area they have reindeers . 
  why not ? 
  i depends on what you mean with far right . 
  no , it is n't really , not compared to other parties , just within sweden . 
  and why it is upvoted is probably because it is honest . 
  and , in sweden , if you are negative to the eu you have to parties . 
  the sd ( sweden democrats ) or vp , the left party , the ( former ) communists . 
  basically one has to choose between two parties one do not like , it is like flipping a coin . 
  ah , now i see , thanks . 
  yes , i have never really liked that system and i can see that it messes up for british voters . 
  we have more that you get the % that votes for you , but we still manages to mess it up ... 
  yes , that is why i said there is no perfect currency , but there are good ones . 
  you see , stockholm transfers money to kiruna ( or in the exact case if kiruna , probably the other way around ) . 
  that is a transfer , so we will be equal . 
  we also have shared foreign debt , shared banks and money transfers for stuff like pensions , health care and schools in case one area can not cover it . 
  we also have roughly the same productivity , we have the sane government and sane rules . 
  that is why the sek works . 
  that is why the gbp works , the usd works and why the d-mark worked . 
  all successful currencies have political , social and financial integration . 
  the euro does n't . 
  that is why it is a shorty currency and why the unemployment is going through the roof and why people are suffering . 
  it sounds intelligent but i am afraid i am a bit ignorant . 
  what is a ftpt system ? 
  and why do they have a bias against smaller parties ? 
  how is it hard to distinguish themselves ? 
  just be against that and the euro . 
  most parties are pro euro you know , perhaps most notably s and m. besides , should n't that broad consensus be shared by the people or are we now in the hands of ruling political class where we have no say ? 
  how can the parties be pro euro when only 13 % want the euro . 
  if that is broad political consensus i do not want it and think it is horrible . 
  what about the will of the people ? 
  and , if almost half the population is against the eu - why is that not reflected ? 
  how is it good if the people 's will is not reflected ? 
  that is not democracy then . 
  it is not just the `` blockpolitik '' . 
  look at the eu elections . 
  that is not block political election , yet they are indistinguishable from one another . 
  the only two who stands out are vp and sd . 
  and , btw , the only ones who pick up the 45 % that are against the eu , and 87 % that are against the euro . 
   i mean , with the european union , it 's almost as if nobody 's at the wheel . 
  how are you supposed to move towards an `` ever closer union '' when you 're constantly adding new members every year at different stages of integration and with different motivations to integrate ? 
  and how do you plan to consolidate not only them , but already-present members , in the middle of a economic crisis ? 
  it just seems like a seriously flawed short-term strategy , and a very uncertain long-term strategy . 
  i know . 
   some of the most successful economies are outside the eurozone however , namely poland , sweden & the united kingdom ( in that order ) . 
  but all have differing financial philosophies , and in the case of the united kingdom , political philosophies as well ( do n't know much about poland and sweden in this regard ) . 
  there is a value in having your own currency , and the euro is a really , really badly thought out currency . 
  apart from that it is also a question about control over ones economy , about ones identity etc. 
   what i 'm trying to say , is maybe it might be easier to convince the northern states to carry the weight of the south states if the european union was more centralized . 
  if it had less members , perhaps it would n't have as much resistance to extending the european union 's sovereignty at the cost of the eurozone members national sovereignty , which i think , although this is merely a opinion , would help in responding to crises perhaps , but from sweden no . 
  maybe it will be easier to convince germany though . 
  mainly , the north are not to keen on carry the weight at all . 
  why should they be really ? 
  we are not one nation , we are several different . 
   and maybe the nations outside the eurozone would have more room to maneuver financially and politically without the e.u. 
  it is not the eu really that has red tape , it is the eurozone countries that ca n't manouver because of the fact that the euro is very badly constructed currency . 
   honestly , i would love to see a consolidated european union with all of the present members , but at the rate it 's going , i just ca n't see the eurozone surviving or remaining stable with the present state . 
  the european union needs a massive overhaul , and like you pointed out , the eurozone states realize this , they just do n't ar n't willing to do it . 
  i do n't . 
  i like being in a national state where my voice counts . 
  i have seen what the eu does when it takes over policies , like the cap , or finances , like in the eurozone . 
  i am honestly hard pressed to say anything the eu does better than my government , apart from obviously being a trade zone , some research and negotiating , and that is if it benefits us . 
   of a car with no driver behind the wheel , or wanting to eat your cake and have it too . 
  true and it will not change . 
  i do n't know exactly what it is like in other countries , but one reason the sweden democrats ( sverigedemokraterna , sd ) is probably going to do well in both the eu and our national election is that all other parties , really say the same thing . 
  correction , maybe not the left , and i expect the left and the sd to take seats in the eu elections . 
  it is very annoying , at least to me , when it is hard to tell the different between the two biggest parties , the moderaterna ( which is center ) and the social democrats . 
  and , there comes sd and actually is at least distinguishable from the other . 
  basically i wish our big parties and their allies would stop hugging the spot in the middle , and actually take a position on something that is not in the center . 
  then our `` insurgent '' parties will not be as successfull . 
  i guess if you go to sweden , stockholm is a good place to go . 
  you can go to old uppsala , bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 , see the stuff in stockholm like the vasa ship etc. 
  i understand what you mean , but i doubt it would work , for several reasons . 
  the big reason that the euro is n't working is that they have only monetary integration , and no political or financial and to diverse economies . 
  think of the usd , how much is the federal tax - 25 % ? 
  or the former d-mark . 
  to get proper integration one essentially have to pool the debt , do massive transfers north to south and essentially give up a lot of the national state .

  the word apelsin/appelsin goes back a few hundred years though so i guess it might have been apel/appel in at least some accents of swedish/norwegian in the past . 
  oh right . 
  i though they meant a german person , never mind then , if it is the language then it is correct . 
  is n't more like cyrilization standards here though ? 
  no wonder you guys need subtitles for your own films . 
  love how the rural parts of scania have been marked for their awful farmers accent . 
  sweden is still pretty intact compared to norway though , at least when it comes to this word . 
  fruit names do n't have to make sense . 
  you might as well say `` apelsin = orange ? 
  wtf . 
  is apple ` red ' ? 
  lol '' riiga already explained above why we call it that . 
  they messed up the swedish word for german . 
  * a german * is * en tysk * , * en tyska * is a german woman ( germaness ? 
  deutschess ? ), 
  please eu !, 
  france is repressing our human right to oppress people !, 
  wow , that was hilarious . 
  i 'm hoping it was satire but knowing europe back then it might well be honest opinion . 
  i 'm pretty sure they think the same of you guys . 
   i mean , everyone has managed to get to grips with what to call holland . 
  i really do hope you were being sarcastic with that one . 
  fortunately by the grace of whatever gods are out there i was not born in latvia . 
  i visited riga for the first and hopefully last time in a flight home from israel . 
  there was no sun . 
  the rain never stopped . 
  there was no connecting corridor between the plane and the airport , everyone got wet . 
  the security guards confiscate items from hand baggage for flimsy reasoning for personal use . 
  i saw a few people smile briefly . 
  they were not latvians . 
  and what role models those nations are !, 
  indeed . 
  in fact , the most famous ugandan alive is most likely the homophobic pastor in the viral `` eat da poo poo '' video . 
  well i 'd understand why a * polish * scientist would do it ... ( joke ), 
  still wo n't work . 
  we abducted all your attractive women within 60 miles of the coast during the danelaw . 
  that 's why we rank so high . 
  sorry to let you down but they 're obviously liars , only chose the option because it was funny . 
  do you really think some norwegian scientist is sitting in some research station in antarctica paddling on his exercise bike trying to power a 35k modem to reach a network in argentina so he can browse reddit ? 
  it 's their way of saying they live in someone elses basement . 
   the 10 % still accounts for more than the entire swedish population . 
  not at all . 
  your population as of 2011 was just above 63 million , a tenth of that is 6,3 million . 
  a 2012 census of sweden puts our population at almost 9,6 million . 
  yup , / r/europe , / r/paradoxplaza and pb are like sisters . 
  and / r/vexillology as well , to a lesser extent . 
  well , this was in 1856 , not 1936 . 
  the king in the northwest !, 
   implying png is part of asia, 
  yeah !, 
  you better run before i hit you with a welfare check !, 
  neither can i , which is why scandinavia 's whiteness on the map surprises me . 
  edit : also , economic hard times are visible in both iberia and greece . 
  that 's because poland borders belarus , where it 's hardly surprising there are n't too many internet users . 
  ( i expected there to be more activity in scandinavia though ) . 
  also , your borders with kaliningrad ( or koenigsberg , for those who dream of prussia ) are quite clearly defined because russia ( being pretty much a dictatorship nowadays ) is both poor and censored , same goes for ukraine . 
  i did n't expect there to be so much activity in poland though , traditional stereotypes define you as quite a grey and poor country . 
  i suppose / r/sweden and / r/tillsverige are your best friends at the moments then . 
  so ... have you been to sweden yet ? 
  this is / r/europe , we demand our dynasty inbreeding-native subjugating-gerry fighting simulators !, 
  if turkey gets mount & blade ( i guess taleworlds is turkish ? ), 
  their publisher ( as well as the developers of many incredible games ) should get to be represented in sweden . 
  we have it sunny here in the very south of sweden as well , which is roughly at the same level as scotland . 
  shhh !, 
  do n't mention the doomsday device !, 
  i mean , that is what a scandinavian would say if , hypothetically , there was a doomsday device ( ridiculous is n't it ? 
  do n't check out our ikea 's too close though ) . 
   no ugly people on sweden remember how vikings abducted women ? 
  now look at the women in england and russia that remained . 
  ( on a more serious note though ; the western ideals of beauty are based on germanic races and their most `` attractive '' features , therefore scandinavians quite likely to fit into the criteria for attractive . ), 
  nice to hear you say that . 
  we scandinavians and our rivalries tend to end up in flaming debates of what country makes the most progress/has the best military/most beautiful nature/best education etc. 
  so it 's nice to see us get along for once . 
  i might add that norwegian fjords and mountains are lovely , and that norwegians as a people are usually seem very nice and upbeat . 
   their society is not very divided , politically or economically . 
  actually we are a very `` divided '' country politically , the largest party in sweden only has 30 % of the vote ( and are not in power because swedish politics work differently than most , it 's a long story ) , but since your political view is considered a very private matter ( as is your wage ) and that it 's considered very rude to bluntly ask someone for their political opinion or to try and force your own upon them , we are not nearly as radical as countries like say ... malta . 
  now there 's a country who likes dynamic elections -, 
  are you still upset about the bibles we stole ? 
  specifically , the silver bible and the devil 's bible . 
  because in history class in sweden , we learn about how we plundered these two famous bibles and that they are currently in a museum in stockholm and that you guys are still pestering about it . 
  in case they were indeed crafted in b\u00f6hmen and you did n't loot or buy them yourself , i 'd say you might have a valid claim even , but since you guys were catholics and the text is thus latin and not czech , that 's one less connection between your cultural heritage and them , what 's your opinion ? 
  i ca n't hear that word without thinking about some weird niche sexual act . 
   they were the least vikingy vikings . 
  what the b\u00f6rk did you just fucking say about me , you little celt ? 
  i 'll have you know i ranked top of my clan in the b\u00f6rk raiders , and i 've been involved in numerous fearsome raids on russia , and i have over 300 confirmed kills . 
  i am trained in berserker warfare and i 'm the top axeman in the entire birka raiding forces . 
  you are nothing to me but just another coastal village . 
  i will plunder you and slaughter your kinsmen with viciousness the likes of which has never been seen before in all of midgard , mark my fucking words . 
  you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the naval messenger service ? 
  think again , milk-drinker . 
  as we speak i am contacting my warband of raiders across the swedish coastline and your letter stamp is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm , maggot . 
  the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life . 
  you 're fucking dead , kid . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime ( with enough prior notice to prepare a naval journey ) , and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways , and that 's just with my waraxe . 
  not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat , but i have access to the entire arsenal of the birka warriors armory and i will use it to its full extent to kick your miserable ass to j\u00f6tunheimr , you little shit . 
  if only you could have known what pagan retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking tongue . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price , din f\u00f6rbannade idiot . 
  i will rip your guts out with fury and you will drown in them . 
  you 're fucking dead , yngling . 
  also hungary beats you in this .

  i would say christmas , midsummer , valborg and new years eve . 
  the rest of the holidays do n't are not really celebrated or noticed in any way except as extra spare time . 
  it is insane . 
  at least the stricter controls gave a very noticable effect . 
  fortunatly it will `` only '' come around 160000 refugees this [ year ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/images/18.5e83388f141c129ba631111f/1449472442062/total_s%c3%b6k.png ) and no we did n't invite them . 
  while we have overly generous rules , we would n't have been overrun like this if the dublin agreement were enforced . 
  you do n't have kebab pizza like we do . 
  nothing really in the two examples above . 
  but a hate crime does n't have to be racist . 
  a hate crime against homosexual people is n't necessarily racist for example . 
  overuse of the word terrorism is also bad . 
  the man behind the ikea-stabbings was n't motivated by some political ideal or the desire to instill fear in swedes . 
  he wanted revenge for being denied asylum and targeted swedes . 
  it is a hate crime not terrorism . 
  the same is true for stabbings at a school in sweden this autumn . 
  it was a racist hate crime , not terror . 
  breiviks shootings on ut\u00f6ya on the other hand was terror since he had prepared a manifesto , let himself get captured and made a big deal about his motivations . 
  and we have had a terror attack in sweden . 
  remember the failed bombing a couple of years ago ? 
  hakkapeliitta cavalry , those savage swedish viking-berserker units . 
  you would n't want to be related to them . 
  yes we are fine with them , except for the few oddball reindeerhating farmers mentioned above . 
  it feel incredibly wierd to even speak about them in terms that separates them from people from southern sweden . 
  there must be some sami on reddit that can clarify . 
  not as far as i know . 
  but the map is crap , sk\u00e5ne in southern sweden , where i live , is listed because of some insurgency 300 years ago when the territory was newly conquered . 
  samis want increased recognition of their language ( s ) and culture . 
  at least some sami languages are recognized minority languages . 
  some want to compare sweden to a colonial power , which is in some ways a valid point . 
  there are some non-sami farmers that do n't like having semi wild reindeer herds passing their land . 
  but old-school reindeerherding samis are a minority of of samis . 
  that would probably be a very grim show , near an apocalypse movie if seen from a german point of view . 
  sapmi , land of the sami people native to northern sweden , norway , finland and the kola peninsula . 
  never heard about it , although i am about twice that age . 
  after a short reading on the great internets it seem to be true . 
  it is a couple of organizations that will be handing out the book in the hope of teachers using it for education . 
  it is not the initiative from the state or schools , that is slightly better than the headlines make it seem like . 
  remember similar books from the milk and forest-industry when i went to school . 
  the discussion is about being able to close it . 
  they do n't discuss if they should close it now . 
  there is a slight difference . 
  the leaders of todays sd thought that a nazi party represented them so much they became members and later leaders of that party . 
  of course we could judge them for that . 
  sd in 30 years when the leadership is replaced is another story . 
  i am not saying it is good but it is not as bad as the title make it seem . 
  and when they grow up , do you think they will limit their dating-pool by only dating exactly their age-group ? 
  for the age of 13-17 years . 
  not the whole population . 
  i honestly think this is mostly because in the early 1600s was the very beginning of european colonization of north america and fur-trade with natives and fishing were more important than pushing inland for more land ( with the associated displacing of natives ) . 
  not because we were particulary nice towards the them . 
  do n't forget swedens and denmarks assorted slave forts in africa . 
  for [ example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_gold_coast ) . 
  the swedish colony in north america was heavily populated by [ finns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_sweden#finnish_influence ) . 
  when the ground freeze it is fit for fighting again . 
  you do n't have to wait until summer . 
  tr\u00e4hus - wooden house , planks over a wooden frame . 
  when you say house , this is what most people think of . 
  timmerhus - timber house , a house made out of solid logs . 
  when i hear the word timber house i think about a smallish house on the countryside . 
  being a citydweller myself they also make me think about vacation . 
  if you make a difference between wooden houses and timber houses like i do : timber houses are common , although they are almost universally old houses/cottages on the countryside and/or small ( approx 10m2 ) houses . 
  they do n't always look like timber houses though since the timber is often covered with planks which make them look like an ordinary wooden house . 
  newer normal houses people live in are rarely made out of timber . 
  if the house is new , not a holiday cottage and look like a timber house it is probably a fake timber house ( ie the timber is i timberlooking planks ) . 
  most newly built houses are made out of drywall over a wooden frame ( i assume this is how most houses are built in the western world today ) . 
  stone houses , concrete villas are rare and i find stone a wierd choice of material unless it is in a warm climate . 
  i assume it would suck to keep a stone house warm in for example belgium during winter . 
  brick houses are that not uncommon . 
  larger buildings in cities are of course mostly made out of stone , concrete or brick . 
  small towns still often have a city centre with wooden buildings though . 
  most swedes think people from stockholm speak the wrong swedish . 
  hint : it look the same . 
  you are a not north germans . 
  you are south-west swedes . 
  sweden . 
  i ca n't really live without an acedemic delay anymore , yet i am not a student . 
  what about encrypted communication between two individuals not using facebook/other company ? 
  the law seem scary and unenforceable to me . 
  the housing is on the outskirts of the village limedsforsen . 
  there is a small grocery store 2-3 km from the housing . 
  a school is in the neighbouring village 5km away . 
  the closest town ( with about 5000 inhabitants ) is ~ 30 minutes away with bus . 
  the general area is quite busy during skiing season and summer . 
  now when it 's off season i presume the village is very sleepy . 
  swords does n't require any permitted to own . 
  no , you are not allowed to carry them while in town or stabbing people . 
  edit : forgot a not , i put the blame on my phone and fat thumbs . 
  [ swedish soldiers ] ( http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article10435123.ab ) have shot thousands of dogs in kosovo . 
  after a quick google search it seem like many other peacekeepers have shot dogs . 
  why and if local authorities do n't continue with this i do n't know . 
  i think that is his point . 
  that i am a lazy coffee drinker who do n't bring down the moose population enough . 
  a refugee crisis has happened the past year . 
  a with refugees comes news of some of them misbehaving.a the associated comment field . 
  not fair to show us pictures of a target like that during hunting season . 
  not everyone has gotten to fulfill their quota . 
  a bullet from a conscript will kill you just as much as a bullet from a professional soldier . 
  i also think that conscripts could be just as motivated ( having been one myself ) as a professional . 
  the difference is that the conscript has had a couple of months to perhaps two years of training while the professional has had many years training and possibly even combat experience . 
  you should n't downplay the fighting spirit of the russian army .

  the huge space between the houses could be used for more than they are today . 
  once i went in there on a whim and just wanted something but did n't know what . 
  i told one of the guys who worked there and he suggested a book and even spent 10-15 minutes finding a selection of books i would like by asking question of what other books i read and so on . 
  i spent like 60 $ on books and learned that i like sci-fi !, 
  but she was swedish . 
  east-swedish . 
  i 'll go hide now ... edit : https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/5cly6x/totally_accurate_world_map/, 
  yes , the problem is that not enough buildings are built . 
  we got space for it , that is for sure . 
  i live next to the hill where they dumped all the rubble . 
  there is a memorial there now over the history lost in those bricks . 
  old town being old town is not part of the problem.lack of political will hampers the building of new houses . 
  some say the very high quality requirements stops us but i disagree . 
  the rules are there for a reason . 
  we simply need a new miljonprogram . 
  ( the miljonprogram is when sweden built many , many houses for people to live in ), 
  i live close to stockholm and visit old town quite often for the sci-fi bookstore . 
  last time i was there i noticed that there were swiss army knives in the windows . 
  people keep mixing upp the swiss and the swedes and i guess they saw an opportunity to earn some money . 
  i want this now . 
  hey , listen , i know my own language and do n't need some swede come here telling me how to spell . 
  it is . 
  had a sm\u00f6rg\u00e5s with pr\u00e4stost and now i feel better about my choice . 
  monarchs have no real power anyway , they could just be figureheads for their specific region , with each region paying for their own monarch . 
  i think several scandinavian languages has that word . 
  i live in stockholm and considered it weird that our city wanted to call itself capital of scandinavia . 
  but then i heard some danes rage about how copenhagen would be better and now i make sure to remind everyone stockholm is the capital :d, 
  now you made me regret buying pr\u00e4stost . 
  thanks alot ... 
  rome had like 2500 years to build , i 'm kind of expecting more : /,

  you 're assuming he or she has something against unnatural . 
  sweden is on a positive list . 
  nice . 
  i 'd prefer a europa army, 
  i did not read those links but they seem to be about us . 
  i knew this was the case in the nordic countries , but i did not know that this was uncommon outside the nordic countries . 
  but i agree that swedes are often quite swede-centric . 
  i did n't know this was a nordic thing . 
  why do they do that ? 
  saw the same thing in denmark and asked the local primitives who they where and they said germans . 
  the plan was to take parts sweden on the way so no , transit denied . 
  i thought you were going to say something about chins or lips first . 
  i actually said `` ha ! '', 
  out loud . 
  and therefore very gorgeous . 
  unfortunatly i think you might have a point . 
  most people here seem to be thinking `` huh , they are shooting each other again '' when they read the news . 
  nope , the article does not say that . 
  he even stress that we are nowhere near a breaking point . 
  he is saying that it has gone further that we should allow it to do , and i agree with him . 
  also he does not mention anything about no go zones , because there are none . 
  there are areas with significantly more criminal acitivity than others . 
  looks like there has been a war there or something : /, 
  nice . 
  springtime for romania . 
  you just do n't want sweden slapped in your face everytime you enter the sub , admit it . 
  what is stopping you ? 
  please come over , 
  my knowledge in swedish , german and english was enough to understand this . 
  amazing . 
  wow , 89 % trust in merkel . 
  i guess i 'm not alone in sweden . 
  your comment made me realize we have not had peace in europe for millenia . 
  i live in a quite eurosceptic country and i do n't feel any such wibes . 
  most people talk about not taking in new members or taking in certain countries were a mistake , but most agree that while they are in , they stay . 
  schhh ... we do n't want germany to correct this statement by anschluss . 
  he and trump complement each other . 
  northern italy stand closer to germans in work ethics too , so maybe there is something to it . 
  i agree . 
  it does n't have to be ubi but we need to keep people from becoming too poor or risk serious instability in our societies . 
  ubi is so far the most reasonable way i 've heard of . 
  i can teach you another word . 
  routsi , it means something like boss or superior . 
  to be fair , if the presidents job is just to cut ribbons it could as well be a life time thing . 
  and we could call him or her emperor or empress ... yeeesssss , i like this . 
  monarchies for the win !, 
  now we need a dane saying you 're welcome . 
  well , if we are lucky they brought some of those tasty sausages . 
  uh , i call not poland too then . 
  i call not greece too !, 
  last country to call not greece get greek politicans !, 
  what can we do , not like it 's our fault we are born with natural bubble butts . 
  corruption like this gives eu a very bad repuation among it 's denizens . 
  if eu want to consolidate and centralize then it must show to be worthy of this responsibility . 
  are you finnish or swiss ? 
  your name confuses me . 
  send that guy hidler to go get them . 
  well , since we live in democracies there could be the argument that an educated population is in everyones interest , wether it 's for work or not . 
  spring , actually . 
  but i get what you mean :p i still stand by the transparancy though . 
  you do n't have to trust politicans if you can see what happens . 
  it 's ok . 
  they are west sweden and east sweden anyway . 
  oooh , clever ... ... for a norwegian . . , 
  i was born hearing impaired and received free hearing aids and went to a school for people with similar problems .

i 'd say that hillary is more likely to start a war . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  i would like to attend hhs , yes . 
  but i do n't think that i will get good enough grades , at least not without complementing them . 
  average of exact b in first grade , so i should be able to read them up to a 's quite easily later . 
  if i score only a 's from now on , that could be good enough for 19,7 . 
  i do n't think i will get 1,95 on the test either , because i 'm not very good at math . 
  luckily , i 'm really good at `` hard '' swedish words , and reading comprehension in english . 
  i 'd definitely be content with going to another school , hhs is just optimal . 
  maybe i 'll study abroad instead , sadly it can easily get expensive though . 
  my parents were/are quite well off , yes . 
  but most of the people they met in italy was through work , and therefore i suppose that they had a similar job to my father ( my mother did n't work there ) , and similar wage . 
  in swedish currency , they are millionaires , yes . 
  most people are , considering the most basic apartment with 1 room can easily be one million . 
  in euro , not so sure , maybe . 
  keep in mind that they did n't own the house in italy , merely rented it ( for about 2000 euro a month , around 2000-2002 ) , partly with the money they made by renting out the house in sweden . 
  back then university was n't really necessary to get a good job , so my father started working at that company at 15 . 
  full time at 19 . 
  so he had 15 years to build his career to that point . 
  today that would mean you are about ( 23 +15 ) 38 . 
  that money at 38 is not strange at all today . 
  you 're probably right that some people lie about their score , but i know for a fact that every single person in my class got an a in social sciences , because our teacher told us so in front of the class , so no lying there . 
  math 1c , 79,3 % got an a or b. 
  that seems like high enough that i would n't hesitate to say that almost everyone got a or b. 
  and i was speaking about a swedish test , which at least i personally find easier . 
  yes , lots of people change programmes . 
  i do n't see that as dropping out . 
  i see dropping out as just blatantly quitting school , starting to work instead or just be at home . 
  i think people do get worse grades in high school than in 9th grade , in general , yes . 
  in 9th grade , some people get greatly inflated grades because of all the bullshit subjects , that for some reason matters just as much as something like math in the final score . 
  some people get a 's in arts , music and other stuff that does n't really matter , while getting bad or mediocre grades in subjects like math , english etc. 
  when these people then get to high school , and do n't have arts and music anymore , their grades drop . 
  good on you for getting such a great score on the h\u00f6gskoleprov !, 
  i 'm doing it next saturday , it 's my first one ( first term in second grade ) , got any tips ? 
  that is my dream outcome , getting a really high score , so that i can go to school to learn and have fun instead of just focusing on grades . 
  i think that 's a huge problem in the school today , it 's so grade oriented that we do n't actually learn anything . 
  this test was just this spring , so i do n't know if the results are public yet . 
  if they are , tell me where to find them and i will look it up . 
  as for the other stuff you wrote , i disagree . 
  your experience in 9th grade just seems like you are salty that someone more popular got better grades than you . 
  or you just had shitty teachers , but atleast that 's not the experience i had . 
  there are no dropouts in my school . 
  we had one girl that got burned out and had to , but she had an a in literally every subject except english in 9th grade , so it really was n't because she was n't good enough . 
  and iirc , the year i applied , there were 200 something applyants , for 60 spots . 
  so not really many vacant spots there . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.google.se/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.grkom.se/download/18.4e85091914e1a80913daf6c1/1473862113560/antagningspo%25c3%25a4ng%2boch%2bmedelv%25c3%25a4rde.pdf&amp;ved=0ahukewjix_vcspdpahwjipokhqmedeiqfggbmaa&amp;usg=afqjcnflwj09wbxtnm_berztasfiikcjda&amp;sig2=d9npsg4ttprsokrprlhbcq ) are the stats for my school . 
  to get accepted into `` naturprogramet '' you needed 313 points , and the average is 325 . 
  if you have a b in every subject you have 297,5 points . 
  so it 's not really surprising that everyone would score b or a on one test . 
  also , you said that it 's all easy as shit , so why is it hard to believe that we get good grades ? 
  i agree that it 's probably quite bad for those that do n't perform very good . 
  it is quite good for higher performing students however . 
  of course there are n't only super good schools and really shitty ones . 
  most are in between . 
  could be improved if the schools got more funding and attention from the government . 
  more funding = higher wages for teachers = more people wanting to be a teacher = better teachers = better students in all schools . 
  41 % of tax money goes to `` social protection ( economical support to people that do n't work and disabled people , pensions , health insurances , financial support for parents etc. ) '', 
  while 13 % go to education . 
  i heard that a reality show like big brother had more applicants than the teachers education in 2015 or something . 
  this system creates quite a pressure on performing good at a young age too . 
  you are supposed to have your good grades when you are 15 or 16 . 
  if you do n't , it will be very hard to catch up . 
  i have a friend , he had very good grades when we went to school together , but he did n't have good enough to get accepted into the really elite school . 
  therefore he chose the local one . 
  when i tried that one out , i was in his class . 
  the teacher returned some national test results that day , and half the class had failed , including my friend . 
  in my school , i do n't think anyone in my class of 30 people got worse than an a or b ( extremely hard to get an a here , the worst grade is an f which is failed . 
  the worst acceptable grade is e , then d , c , b and a. 
  so getting only a 's and b 's is pretty much the same or harder than what americans call `` straight a 's '' ) . 
  yes . 
  i could go to one that is 5 minutes away , but it 's a shit one , and i 'm quite tired of the people in my town . 
  therefore i have chosen to go to a way better school in gothenburg . 
  i do n't know how it works in italy , but here you have to get admitted into school , based on grades . 
  if there are more people applying than there are spots at the school , they only admit the people with the best grades . 
  say there are 100 spots for the economic program ... and 300 people want to go there . 
  only the 100 people with best grades will be accepted . 
  if you go to another school with 100 spots , but only 60 people apply . 
  everyone gets in , regardless of grades . 
  this makes it so that some schools consist of exclusively really good students , creating a very good environment for studying , while also making it more sought after for teachers , so that they can choose the best ones . 
  no teachers want to teach at a school that everyone gets into , if they instead can choose to work at a school with only smart kids that are all motivated ( do n't fuck around in class , do their work etc. ) . 
  therefore i have chosen one of the `` elite '' schools , which makes it worth the commute . 
  i actually got quite tired of commuting last year ( waking up at 5:30 every day does that ) , so i decided to try out the local school for a few days . 
  figured it could n't be that bad . 
  it was , it was day and night . 
  i no longer have any doubts about the commute being worth it . 
  buy one instead . 
  save up for the direct fee , probably will be faster than waiting for an apartment to rent . 
  then , when you want to move out you can sell it , most likely for profit . 
  when you rent , it 's just money out all the time . 
  the most fancy unis are in stockholm actually . 
  as an example , i 'm quite keen on going to stockholm school of economics . 
  if i 'm accepted and choose to attend it , i 'm gon na have to move to stockholm ( from gothenburg ) . 
  this means that i 'm moving away from home at 19 . 
  we have considered the possibility of me moving to gothenburg ( from where i live about an hour away ) to shorten my commute to high school . 
  i 'm 17 . 
  the only real reason i do n't is because my parents do n't trust me to eat healthy , go to bed in time , wake up in time for school etc. 
  family ties are not that important that we want to live with eachother for half of our lives . 
  parents always joke about kicking us out at 18 , stuff like `` my biggest wage increase will be when the kids move out '' . 
  since you are italian , and i and my parents have lived in italy , i 'll tell you what my parents have told me . 
  the italians were absolutely shocked to hear that they had a kid , a villa in italy , one in sweden , two cars and a boat , before being 30 years old .

  what color is the sky in your world ? 
  this thread is like all other threads about sweden on r/europe . 
  conspiracy theorists and right wing extremists . 
  love how you all prove how right i am . 
  which is ironic , since sweden treating them as equals lead to dislike of sweden on r/europe , and has sweden described like you do . 
   ikolla is a professional victim no , that would clearly be you . 
  we also have this : http://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/sifo-rodgrona-ater-storre-an-alliansen/ they are not the biggest , they are 3rd biggest . 
  these news are not allowed though . 
  heavily downvoted . 
  pathetic how people go on about `` democracy in work '' . 
  racist can manipulate and scream and silence people as much as they want , but disagree with them and its `` anti-democratic '' . 
  oh and by the way http://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/sifo-rodgrona-ater-storre-an-alliansen/ sd is 3rd biggest at 18 % . 
  s 26 % , m 24 % . 
  wow , all that for david hasselhoff !, 
  getting pretty tired of all this bullshit . 
  there was nothing reasonable about your comment . 
  grow up . 
   do you not even know how stupid you sound ? 
  this makes no sense what so ever . 
   that does n't make me racist , rightwinger or dishonest . 
  so why are you atatcking those that dare to talk about the problems with racism ? 
  r/europe is pretty extreme , so why defend it ? 
  why do you defend the racist bubble , but accuse me of being in one ? 
  that is higly suspect , no ? 
  what is then your agenda , if not racism ? 
  because if it was purely anti-immigration , there is no need for those tricks . 
  everything about this screams of / r/europe moving towards r/european . 
  more racist propaganda , more lies . 
  threads about sweden will be even more dishonest . 
  very bad news . 
   he does n't even hide it . 
  neither do you right wing extremists . 
  bjarkebjarke often shows that he is nothing but a right wing extremists . 
  that he always gets upvotes for it speaks volumes about what is going on here . 
  they are just ding their thing as usual . 
  how old are you people ? 
  you sound like you still in middle school . 
  no wonder the immigrant threads look like they do , with right wing extremists like you dumbing it down . 
   i 'm not even a rightwinger or racist . 
  heheh , no , no at all ... you just had to force it , and try to insult me for no reason what so ever . 
  no reason at all . 
  several childish comments in response to this . 
  like you all know just how right i am . 
  fuck this justification of the misuse of downvotes . 
  these threads are patetic . 
  unless you are aggressively anti-immigration , racsit or right wing extreme then you get downvotes . 
  there is a reason there were a need to put them in mega-threads . 
  and we see it now again , as they take over the forum . 
  if you bring facts into it , or just being rational , then just downvotes . 
  um , you understand that the point of affirmative action is to improve a situation and work against discrimination , not the other way around ? 
  ( facepalm ) r/europe please . 
  about the `` relaxing the moderation '' , i cant help but worry that these changes will move / r/europe more towards r/european . 
  for example , threads about sweden are almost always filled with racist propaganda and turns into a political platform for a racist party . 
  if mods do n't control the subs , then racists will . 
  the downvotes and childish comments speak volumes .

  http://www.europeanguardian.com/78-uncategorised/europe/604-danish-politicians-mock-sweden-s-introduction-of-dark-plasters they just like racist propaganda and lies for no reason ? 
  https://sv.reddit.com/r/european/comments/3h9uzq/after_an_increase_in_police_resources_along_with/ well ? 
  its 99 % . 
  stop playing stupid . 
  anti-immigration people do n't want to `` talk '' . 
  they just scream about censorship or `` we are we not allowed to talk '' when someone do n't agree with them . 
  they have have made any debate in sweden impossible , with their hatred of anything non-racism . 
  they spend more time attacking non-racists for talking about racism , then they do about immigration . 
  there is an picture of him eating his food in front of his hitler altar . 
  he has arranged his meatballs as a swastika . 
  there was a right wing extremists found with 500kg of dynamite in sweden , and he said he `` could be bigger then breivik '' . 
  i do n't think i need to point out what sweden-threads always looks like . 
  they often raid sweden-threads , together with / r/swedenyes . 
  they seem to actually fool / r/europe quite often . 
  and the whole `` sweden is racist and opressive '' speech never happened . 
  once again imagined by the politically incorrect and paranoid . 
   edit : oh look , you deleted your comment . 
  real brave . 
  sigh ... no , the mods removed the entire thread because of the racist hivemind . 
  is it because danes are so obsessed with screaming about `` pc !! '', 
  that you make shit up ? 
  no one was called racist . 
  once again this is just danes going crazy over nothing . 
  `` a debate started , but in denmark not sweden . 
  danish media reported on a claimed debate in sweden , where `` plasters where accused of racism '' . '', 
   it seems like everything in sweden has to be so pc , and honestly , it 's sickening to look at . 
  you people are like a sect . 
  conspiracy theorists that just imagine things that are not there , so you can scream `` pc !!! '' . 
  danes are obsessed with it . 
  you realize that its denmark being sensitive and naive right ? 
  there was no debate in sweden , no one was called racist , its just in danish media , doing their thing as usual . 
  yes , it looked like whiterights or / r/european raided . 
  just racist conspiracy theories and propaganda . 
   please stop fixating on the colour of their skin , you seem to be obsessed . 
  really ? 
  those retorical tricks are older then the internet . 
  who are you trying to fool ? 
  if you know so much about scandinavia , you should know by now that dansih media often makes shit up about sweden . 
  the only story here is that their fm was naive enough to believe a false story that originally came from a right wing extreme blog , and then spread to danish media . 
  yeah danish media is very much fox news . 
  they have their spin on everything about sweden .

  they were also the only political party not 200 pro immigration/white genocide . 
  which is how the last 20 years have felt like . 
  not just for me but for a lot of people in the urban south . 
  do n't get me wrong , sweden is still one of the best places on the world to live but there have been changes and increased insecurity . 
  lots if not all if it is caused by the mass exodus and the last 8 years of right wing goverment which caused a drawback in social security and goverment owned infrastructure being privatized and decreasing in quality and increasing in costs . 
  sd is now in talks with the largest right block party about creating an alliance . 
  sd have been the only party to even touch the immigration policy untill recently which is why the reached 12.9 % of the votes last election . 
  there have been criminal investigations about assaults among the top figures of sd . 
  recently a core member of the party had to resign , i ca n't quite recall at the moment but i think it was over russian ties and russian money transfers into the party which is a big no go among the nordic and baltic countries . 
  the ruling party s or socialdemocrats for long recently went against the schengen agreement and eu to establish a border control here in the south because of tons of unregistered immigrants came enmasse at the start of the syrian war . 
  mostly to force them to register for asylum and get tracked rather than going underground and go into crime . 
  the control it self was n't ment to reduce the incoming amounts of immigrants but it did and the control have been prolonged and get extended every time it 's time for a vote about it all this combined with brexit , the rise of the british fascism ( polie state ) trumps aboslutely horrible rule of the whitehouse , trumps anti-eu agenda , russian cocksucking , le pen being alive and well in france and the russian agression in the east keeps me so far away from the political right that i 'm going full circle . 
  bernie and everyone of his supporters gave birth of a little hope for the future . 
  seeing the european union in action right now , making laws for the people , not big business makes me happy . 
  canada speaking warmly about us warms me even though i 'm sceptical about the new trade agreement . 
  all those things that sd wants to abolish because of brown people . 
  i just ca n't vote for them because i 've seen what it leads to . 
  it 's funny that everytime there is a post positive about scotland staying in the eu as their own country , an angry and bitter briton comes kicking amd screaming . 
  i find it funny how you voted to leave the eu and then deny others to leave the uk . 
  the anglosphere have been pretty much a police state since the 90 's . 
  i would n't even think of moving to uk , us or aus . 
  another malm\u00f6 dweller here . 
  people really fail to mention that most of the problems in sweden is from imported organized crime . 
  lots of normal immigrants gets stuck in the drugs too . 
  it 's neither safe or unsafe right now . 
  i would say it 's helluva lot safer than the us for one . 
  safer than majority of europe too perhaps . 
  by swedish standard ? 
  the aboslute worst place to be . 
  not trying to selfpromote but sweden got a booming millitary tech industry that 's ready to expand . 
  i can only imagen that lots of other eu countries have the same . 
  there is no need to rely on us tech . 
  i 'm pretty outspoken about being anti-feminism but seriously , this is fucking rediculous . 
  people know nothing about international relationships and diplomacy . 
  being feminist should make you against islamic views on women , yes but as it 's a very leftist movement it 's often crossed with culturalmaxism . 
  people tend to forget that they went as women either way . 
  met the cavemen half way . 
  i think that 's strong . 
  i would n't go further south than italy if i were a woman . 
  this is just more alt-nazis trying to spam reddit with shit articles . 
  i think we need to work with the states with have right now before taking on more but yeah . 
  it would be great to let even more countries join . 
  funny enough , you started your own stupid circlejerk . 
  also , do n't be so be so damn pissy about people wanting to give scotland a second chance . 
  we wanted the whole uk to stay but fucked that up . 
  i get that the immigration issue is a hot topic and is a great consern and weight on the social security western europe has but voting for someone who wants to destroy everything that makes the west and france as great as it is ? 
  really ? 
  that 's the absolutely the single dumbest and most retarded thing anyone can do . 
  no it 's not very reasonable just because it caters to your opinion . 
  moat western nations have reported attempts from russia to manipulate their population either by economic attacks or by opinion news . 
  sweden catch russian spies doing corprate espionage on a yearly basis for instance . 
  if mist western nations report the same thing , is it still a lie ? 
  also , i remember that the us have been plauged by numerous leaks the last 10-20 years . 
  whistleblowers and wikileaks have been up their arse . 
  why would n't there be whisleblowers from russia ? 
  it 's healthy to question but you have to look at the sources . 
  it 's like science . 
  if a large enough number of countries/scientists report the same finding , consider it peer reviewed . 
  i 'm not really sure what you are on about but part of having eastern european countries in the eu should be to bring them into 2017 and make them equal to western europe . 
  i 'm glad that they 're no longer part of the failed state russia/ussr but they are still part of it mentally . 
  that 's a problem if we want a united eu . 
  the balkans on the otherhand needs a millitary intervention . 
  i have no hope for those guys . 
   i see it as a dysfunctional group of children . 
  i see the eu as a joke yeah ... no ... an enemy . 
  still . 
   ... but instead of becoming stronger , the eu is fixated with trump while russia invades from the east . 
  ... a convenient distraction from its own failure . 
  you have no idea what 's going in europe or the us right now . 
  you have absolutely no idea how trump affects the eu and what part of the economy russia serves . 
   ... and just so you understand my motivation here : it is n't because i dislike europe - i still consider myself part european ( my parents were born there ) . 
  my current anger with europe is my disappointment in their failure face their problems . 
  europe is going to learn some painful problems in the next few years . 
  hopefully it will emerge stronger . 
  suffer for your amusement ? 
  you 're not european . 
  your parents my be but you 're not . 
  and what problems ? 
  the one created by migrants exploiting the system ? 
  the russians threatning the eastern states ? 
  trumps plan to disolve the eu ? 
  i do n't think you get to talk about the any problems . 
  the union was created 23 years ago . 
  it 's young and was n't created to be what it is today . 
  it has 28 member countries and keeps growing . 
  every country comes with a diffrent history , diffrent economy and diffrent politics . 
  do you think things move quickly in a demcracy that big and complex ? 
  yes , i wish we did n't have to rush thing as we have to right now . 
  nato was ment to protect the west . 
  i wish everyone would pull their weight but they do n't . 
  trump/putin wants to dissolve nato yesterday . 
  eu would be able to raise a defense force in 5 to 10 years if we got a heads up which we did n't . 
  you talk about it as a failure because you want it to fail . 
  you do n't . 
  that 's why we here in the west learn to check more than 1 source . 
  which we have unlike russia and china that is under state control . 
  remember to always check other news sources . 
  in your country and outside . 
  really this . 
  what 's the options ?

  finland woes are in large part due to the euro . 
  but expecting basic economic knowledge on reddit is a flawed assumption , of course . 
  i do n't really see how this is absolving the pro-refugee crowd . 
  this , if anything , makes matters * worse * . 
  how did these people come to be nationals in the first place ? 
  coming as refugees in earlier waves . 
  so what we 're dealing with is decades of radicalisation . 
  so this is what we have * right now * , even without even more refugee immigration . 
  and you want to * increase * this ? 
  how is vindicating anything some of you have been advocating at all ? 
  this would be hilarious if it were n't so delusional . 
  right , except that israel is doing apartheid against palestinians , while the minister is using ( unnecessary ) hyperbole to point out the arrogance and idiocy of the german line . 
  it 's amazing to me how fast merkel 's concensus collapsed . 
  she wo n't be removed from office ( dream on , folks ) , but i would n't be surprised to find countries like denmark or even the uk siding with ee against her over this issue . 
  and a shitshow which was planted by merkel , even if you 'll go to hell and back to try to cover for her . 
  stand up for all people , including yourself . 
  masochism of your kind is shitty and useless . 
  does n't preclude standing up for other people either . 
  what an idiot . 
  so basically what you 're articulating is the reason why csu will continue to be a no-name party , they do n't have the balls to go after a chancellor who is a far-leftist ( like you ) on massive 3rd world migration . 
  the spinelessness is amazing to watch . 
  i have to admit , i 'm almost , kind of , impressed by merkel 's radicalism on refugees . 
  it 's like she * really , really * does n't want germany to remain a place of ethnic germans . 
  she 's always been attacked for being so passive and emotionless but this subject of massive 3rd world migration has her totally passionate . 
  i do n't believe she will * ever * budge on this issue . 
  and as such , i doubt that afd will ever seriously challenge her . 
  the only real opposition is the spd and they are identical to her on this issue , perhaps even more radical than she is . 
  exactly . 
  it 's well known that polls in sweden * always * underestimated sd when they were conducted over the phone . 
  the internet-based polls were mocked but they turned out to be more accurate both in 2010 and in 2014 . 
  do n't know where zalt is getting his fud that phone polls are more likely to be prone to controversial opinions - it 's the exact opposite . 
  the real numbers are probably worse than that polls show . 
  i thought no other country in the eu would be such a banana republic like sweden but germany keeps doing its best to exceed my expectations . 
  we have to end the notion that white people have to solve 100 % of the world 's problems in the first place . 
  anyone who says the current refugee crisis is because of syria is lying to you . 
  over 66 % of all new asylum applicants are n't even from syria . 
  in sweden , we 're seeing * record * asylum seekers from afghanistan . 
  even if the country is safe ( r ) than it was 10 years ago , we 're seeing 20x increases in applications . 
  in the past few weeks , we 're seeing more from afghanistan than even from syria . 
  iraq is also a country where we 're seeing massive , 10x increases compared to 7-8 years ago , when the country was in fact much more dangerous than it is today . 
  the reason why we 're seeing this massive wave is because of a de facto open borders regime . 
  that 's it . 
  bombing syria will not do much . 
  why are we always missing the fundamental question of magnets ? 
  also , how much of syria is even left to bomb ? 
  it 's all rubble now . 
  i 'm amazed how people ca n't understand that there is n't a military solution to everything in the world . 
  it may feel better , but it wo n't solve anything . 
  this is a problem that can be contained from our side , but it ca n't be solved . 
  you wipe out isis and you got 10 more islamist groups left . 
  are you going to spend the rest of your days just killing things ? 
  that 'll be great recruitment propaganda for these groups . 
  what we need is to totally eliminate the white saviour complex and end the open-borders dogma . 
  then , and only then , can we begin to mend the issue at hand . 
  not before . 
   liquidate their ghetto society easier said than done . 
  how are you going to go about that ? 
  can we now please abandon the fiction that turkey shares anything at all with europe and just call it the islamist quasi-dictatorship that it is ? 
  thanks . 
  they are terrible on the environment , though . 
  just like the uk one . 
  honestly , i feel like there is this choice in europe now . 
  either you got a government like the one in sweden right now , which is amazing on the environment but horrible on 3rd world migration or you take the one in the uk/poland who are good on 3rd world migration but atrocious on the environment . 
  there should n't have to be a choice , but right now there is . 
  what are you doing , using logic on the internet ? 
  i 've been hearing about the imminent demise of merkel for months now . 
  the reality is that there is nobody on the horizon who can challenge here . 
  she could well win re-election . 
   africa is gon na have a population boom , we ca n't have them all come here . 
  according to the un population projections , sub-saharan africa will go from 1 billion to 4 billion over this century . 
  this is just the beginning . 
  just talking about ending the influx will no longer be sufficient , repatriation will necessarily come to the agenda . 
  and we already , in fact , see the first signs of that here . 
  the difference is that the leaders who will drive a hard-bargain ca n't be pro-3rd world migration types like merkel . 
  but they 'll come , eventually . 
  europe wo n't be the social office of the 3rd world and remain a place with welfare states . 
  the math does n't add up . 
  and no , the `` aging of the population '' argument is bs , too , in large part because any lower age is nullified by low social capital and low to no language skills at all . 
  and we have n't even talked about robots and automation , yet . 
   i agree . 
  europe needs an offshore center for failed asylum seekers asap . 
  europe doens ' t need asylum seekers at all . 
  sweden currently spends 2x the ** entire ** un budget for syrian refugees . 
  you read that one right so sweden , over the next four years , could fund the entire syrian refugee budget for double the amount of time and instead of taking 100,000 we could help several millions but of course this has nothing to do with humanitarianism . 
  it 's an ideological project , that 's being done under the pretense of `` humanitarianism '' . 
  follow the money . 
  if they * really * wanted to help people , the money would be spent in a radically different way . 
  the eu is a joke . 
  they rolled over for turkey and now the africans are seeing it works , as well , so they go for it . 
  instead of showering both of them with money , why not stop the pull factors ? 
  oh wait , merkel has already said she will never do that . 
  so this entire shitshow is a stage act . 
  it 's basically paying money for appearances , so that people will think something will be done when in reality , merkel et al has already ruled out any real action . 
  come back when you take 2000 * per day * , like we do . 
  and on per capita levels , that 'd be 12 000 a day . 
  i 'm not saying it 's wise , i 'm just sayin ' , you ai n't sweating boy . 
  you ai n't sweatin ' . 
  there is no need to get that drastic . 
  this entire `` negotiation '' is a sideshow . 
  as long as sweden/germany/austria refuses to budge on how easy it is for african migrants to get asylum , more will come .

  finland may not have norse myths but still unique seriously here in sweden you can find runestones and remnants of ancient days everywhere . 
  norway or denmark, 
  people on internet think scandinavia is a shithole . 
  to be fair if this poll was about sweden i would choose scandinavian countrys first then probably uk, 
  i dont get it, 
  people blame the whole population of countrys always based on their media or government, 
  people talk way much shit about sweden and europe in general when in fact sweden and other scandinavian countrys are still safest countrys in the world no matter what the pathetic 4chan circlejerk says . 
  but yeah foreigners of muslim background in sweden are the ones who is behind most rapes . 
  everybody knows that, 
  crazy feminist and political correctness and taking american terms and think it will work here, 
  it is true meanwhile americans think thank god we are not like sweden but what you fail to realise is how much like america sweden has become, 
  everything filthy that comes out from r/the _ donald and 4chan about sweden . 
  if sweden is a turd then finland is a son of a turd, 
  norway is the scotland of scandinavia denmark ireland and sweden england, 
  i dont think being stronk means lower life expectancy, 
  speak for yourself . 
  most of sweden is safe and do not look like malm\u00f6 . 
  where i live pretty much nothing happens but i guess the negative stuff is the stuff you hear most about which is well good bit people fail to see past the twisted image . 
  its like thinking america is all like detroit, 
  every nordic country is still better than most to live in, 
  finland got no reason to hate sweden , dont know why its so popular, 
  haha seriously ? 
  why would the language by english if there was a nordic union ? 
  you are trying to force us into becoming even more like america which our politicians has already done . 
  to say we lack culture is just retarded , sweden is an old country full of culture and history , we have runestones and burial mounds everywhere which is 1000s years old and many even older than that . 
  also i stay with having scandinavian values instead of trying to be `` modern '' because being `` modern '' isnt something positive to me, 
  i think it is a wet dream for alot of us scandinavians to form an union . 
  i read somewhere the idea of an union is popular among the people, 
  well this is not made by someone from reddit or 4chan i think . 
  those jokes are getting old, 
  sweden is still one of the whitest countrys, 
  looks like your beloved eastern europe isnt as white as the islamic nation of sweden, 
  america is perfect in every way compared to any european country and stats lie and are propaganda/s, 
  people let media think for them , its like some europeans thinking america is a warzone based on what they see on media and sadly people dont bother to look beyond media about anything, 
  the swedish media is not the average swedish person also they call swedes racist too . 
  the support of our media is now at its lowest %, 
  shut the hell up with your bullshit, 
  same here in sweden . 
  not the politicians but the people, 
  its funny how you only hear shitty news from sweden . 
  sweden has stricter control and want less immigration now . 
  the people has wanted less immigration for a long time , swedes are not like you believe they are, 
  you would be suprise how many swedes hate our politicians the media and wishes we would be more like denmark . 
  stuff has happened . 
  but yeah people assume we will have the same politicians in power for 30 more years, 
  lol you dont know anything about swedes only people too brainwashed or in deep denial think like that , the people do not like our politicians and media, 
  sweden has already and will probably change more . 
  the only thing people talk about is immigration and the stupid politicians have the lowest support ever, 
  exactly . 
  media and propaganda is powerful . 
  dont judge a entire country and its people based on what you hear or see . 
  do some research and even visit the country, 
  well being `` swedish '' wasnt really a thing back then but yes but sweden has alot of runestones that mentions raids on england but scandinavians back then was mostly known as danes even if they werent from what is modern senare . 
  but yes alot of vikings from what is sweden today went east, 
  everyone knows that people should trust retarded memes from 4chan instead of doing research or see beyond media . 
  propaganda is a powerfull tool . 
  people should look beyond media and do research or even visit the country before judging it . 
  entire sweden isnt some shithole ghetto and you dont have to like swedens politics to like the country . 
  many swedes laugh at the stupid politics too, 
  media and stereotypes are powerfull tools . 
  just because you are from x country you must agree and support everything your leaders does, 
  finally someone gets deported like they deserve . 
  if you come here and commit crimes you have nothing to do here, 
  hey !, 
  you ignorant bigot nazi racist !, 
  that is their job !, 
  the people are talking, 
  the people are talking, 
  i agree !, 
  lets do it br\u00f6der !, 
  i knew you were gay finland . 
  your obsession over calling swedes gay made it too obvious, 
  yeah i agree but i think the scandinavian circle jerk from both sides are annoying, 
  they are too political correct , simple as that . 
  so people look for alternativ media instead which also is biased but they are at least speaking about the problems the mainstream media refuses to admit is true, 
  swedish media is horrible which is why it got really low opinion from the people right now . 
  people are tired of biased mainstream media . 
  well done denmark btw, 
  200 % to be shot, 
  exactly , we have become like a mini us . 
  i say the same thing to americans . 
  you do not live here, 
  but people tell me whites are an minority in sweden ? 
  that is true . 
  so why wont you admit the same thing is happening in sweden ? 
  the vast majority of sweden is not malm\u00f6, 
  people have bashed sweden for awhile now , mostly lowlives from 4chan but the cancer spreads quickly . 
  if you mention you are from sweden on the internet you will probably get comments like lol fkn cuckd !, 
  lol sven how does it feel to have your women raped ? 
  or lol sweden is my fav islamic state !, 
  it isnt even funny , i am one of the swedes that does think we got alot of problems but i do not makes retarded jokes about rape etc. 
  its that capital smug syndrome, 
  we are not . 
  which is why the media and government is losing power, 
  dude you dont know shit , not every part of sweden looks like this . 
  where i live there is pretty much no muslims . 
  it is the shitty suburbs and large citys, 
  we are getting rid of the retarded government , polls show the support for swedish media and government is really low . 
  meanwhile swedendemocrats is getting more and more popular , the average swede is tired of the retards in charge, 
  how dare you say that about the proud and mighty america ?

because he attempted to land on top of a crowded beach ? 
  edit : i think the correct charge would be ( involuntary ) manslaughter . 
   why are you lying about sweden ? 
   those papers are not all left . 
   svd is `` obunden moderat '' dn is `` obunden liberal '' expressen is `` obunden liberal '' aftonbladet is `` obundet socialdemokratisk '' ( left ) literally lol . 
  now who is trying to fool the non-swedes ? 
  you 're going to try say with a straight face that e.g. 
  dn and expression are not left-wing ( particularly in the context of immigration policy ) ? 
   and that 90 % of journalists in those papers would be left is just a number you pulled out of your ass . 
  it 's an estimate . 
  i may be wrong - it may be 80 % , i give you that . 
   furthermore , sd is not the biggest party . 
  according to scb socialdemokraterna is the biggest at 31,4 % in the latest poll . 
  sd is at 13,5 % . 
   http://www.inizio.se/opinion/ those pollers ( run by the government and paid for/selected by aftonbladet , respectively ) failed miserably to predict the results of sd during the run-up to the last election because of outdated polling methods ( things like only calling people who have landlines and and so on ) . 
  iirc yougov was the most precise at that time . 
  they are currently polling sd at around 25 % , plus or minus a percent depending on the weather . 
  see http://status.st/ for lots of data regarding this . 
  you are right that i mistakely labeled sd the largest party . 
  sd is the second-largest party according to e.g. 
  the latest yougov poll . 
  i 'm sorry for this mistake . 
   and moderaterna just opened for discussion with sd this spring . 
  it did n't really go anywhere though . 
   are you even swedish ? 
  maybe you are a russian shill . 
  either way you 're lying . 
  maybe the truth doesnt fit your world view ( hej du , jo , jag \u00e4r faktiskt svensk . 
  fast det d\u00e4r g\u00f6r sig nog b\u00e4ttre via ljud ... ) not everyone who disagrees with you is a foreign agent . 
  this world view is kind of . . paranoid . 
  people do n't want to be labelled nazis , which is literally what happens if you express support for the one major party that is against this . 
  it 's a bit more complex than this , of course , but in a nutshell this is it . 
  sometimes some known person makes some a statement against the insanity . 
  this will trigger the media into a blood frenzy , all going after this person . 
  at some point one of two things then happens : 1 ) they recant , say their apologies etc. 
  2 ) they stand by what they said . 
  they are then ostracized - they will lose jobs , appearances , media opportunities , etc - essentially being blackballed from public society . 
  as you can imagine it takes some guts to stand up against this . 
  heck , it even takes courage and active planning to vote for the anti-immigration party : http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=6130994  `` in sweden it takes an extra effort to keep your vote secret , compared to many other countries , and now the european commission is asking the swedish government to comment on swedish election praxis . 
    . .   `` when i got into the polling station i simply could n't believe my eyes '' says christian dworeck , who moved to sweden from germany . 
  he went to vote in the eu election last year . 
    what he saw was a big table full of voting slips for each party . 
  he could clearly see who people were voting for , by seeing which of the different party ballot papers they took . 
    if you really want to make sure no one sees who you vote for you have to literally take slips from all the parties - and there can be dozens . 
  this includes at least eight major parties and many small radical , joke or single-issue ones . '', 
  the party in question wants to change this voting process , and of course the other parties do not want that , so nothing is happening . 
  that 's bullshit in this case . 
  the birth rate numbers in sweden are quite okay ( around 1.9 births per woman ) . 
  if the internet did n't exist journalism would n't have been a feel-good thing to do for left-wing activists and we likely would n't be in this spot . 
  ( i say this as an otherwise extreme internet enthusiast . 
  what are you trying to say ? 
  it 's different though ; in the us there 's serious money to be made in national-level news/entertainment . 
  `` well '' :p, 
  it seems the thread was restored ... 
  the metrics are still kinda good , compared to other countries . 
  what we are all worrying about is economics 10-20 years from now . 
  these kinds of economic shifts do n't happen overnight . 
  extrapolate the results of immigration numbers , massively decreasing atheist numbers , crime-ridden cultures etc. 
  it 's either that or disregard the welfare model and go full on us style , everyone for themselves . 
  which , coindicidentally is what it looks like we are seeing the start of in sweden . 
  welfare services ( particularly healthcare and police ) are beginning to break down under the pressure . 
  to pick a flair , just look at the right bar  and yeah , arnstad is just an utterly unqualified idiot . 
  media latched on to him because he was saying things that matched their thoughts . 
  you 're from denmark ? 
  ( pick a flair ! ), 
  ah : i get what you talk about . 
  that debate was a cringe-fest , because of who `` we '' sent . 
  we have an expression nowadays , `` you never go full arnstad '' . 
  a big reason for why we are seeing this is the swedish media landscape . 
  a small number of platforms control pretty much all mainstream communication : aftonbladet , expressen , dagens nyheter , svenska dagbladet , svt and sr. . six platforms run by three organizations . 
  they all employ young , cheap journalists/activists who are 90 % left-wing . 
  the vast majority of the national-level media that reaches swedes is quite biased in the favor of ( often uncontrolled ) immigration . 
  people who consume media from these platforms ( and it 's quite hard not to ) get an understanding of the nation that is ... quite fucked up . 
  they 're generally not factually wrong , it 's just the stories they pick ( and do n't ) . 
  and the facts that they choose to show and not . 
  an important part of this development is the extreme devaluation of the journalistic profession caused by the development of the internet and the web . 
  the people who have wanted to become journalists , because of this , are the kind of people who do n't care about making a good living as much as they care about making a political difference to society . 
  these people invariably tend to be left-wing . 
  the centrists and ring-wingers go into tech or finance instead . 
  so this is how we have ended up with reporters / `` journalists '' in our news papers/tv who often act a lot more than left-wing redditors than actual journalist professionals who take pride in doing their work in a neutral way . 
  this combined with the politics of the the former `` right-wing '' government ( `` moderaterna '' - who actually started this insanity ) and then the current `` left-wing '' social democratic party who are continuing it ... has proved to be the kryptonite that will likely break sweden as we know it . 
  the currently largest party at about a quarter of the opinion is vehemently against this kind of immigration . 
  it 's being isolated by the other parties and relentlessly subjected to scrutiny ( sometimes correctly , often not ) by the leftist media . 
  their obvious strategy is to isolate this party and to make it socially risky to associate oneself with it . 
  they are all ( the other parties and all of the mass media ) fighting against this opinion and in particular the party . 
  despite this , it 's popularity is gaining , no matter what kinds of names their followers are called . 
  people can after all still look outside their window and see what is happening . 
  government-run academic research has shown ( som institure , gothenburg university ) that people have been against the current level of immigration non-stop since the 90s . 
  despite this , i think it will at least another 4-6 years of economic destruction of sweden before any meaningful policy change is done . 
  now imagine how much pain the more clueful part of the swedish population has been going through for at least the past five years . 
  btw , the economic impact on the swedish welfare state will likely be much , much larger than even the most massive , horrific terrorist attacks imaginable . 
  ever since about 2012 , it 's been absolute career suicide ( for most people , at least in high income roles ) to talk about these kinds of things negatively in the company of people that you do n't trust absolutely . 
  the vast majority of people do n't want to rock the boat , and so stay silent , afraid of any social repercussions . 
  : / and i do n't think things will get better soon . 
  i 'm looking to move abroad - denmark and the netherlands are on my radar . 
  another sign that this massive ( often muslim and almost always poorly educated ) immigrant flow largely is an elitist thing that is not supported by the people of sweden is shown by the public surveys annually performed by the som institute at the university of gothenburg . 
  since the 90s , the public has in large been against the level of immigration that has been seen . 
  when vacationing in southern sweden last month my car radio caught some danish radio , probably broadcast from bornholm . 
  they were discussing problems surrounding immigration . 
  i was totally flabbergasted by the sheer open mindedness displayed by both parties in that discussion .

  i know that . 
   so the ottoman-serb alliance was halted after the capture of constantinople ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  idk you 're free to use facts , im not the most educated on the subject but i know a fair amount of stuff about it . 
   they fought against them like anyone did , but serbs were the only ones from the balkans who helped them conquer the byzantine empire thus bringing a dark age of ottoman rule here . 
  there were tons of janissaries , from all different nationalities , who were all just as `` voluntarily '' helping as those forcibly taken 1 ' 500 serbian cavalrymen . 
  not to mention that the guy who was forced to surrender the troops had invested in byzantine walls to protect it . 
  i see you talking about serbs very often , so idk about that last part . 
   while the nazis were exclusively responsible for attempted extermination the jews of serbia proper , they were assisted by local quislings in the nedic government and others , who helped round up the jews , romani and serbs who opposed the nazi occupation . 
   ** while the nazis were exclusively responsible for attempted extermination the jews of serbia proper ** , they were assisted by local quislings in the nedic government and others , who helped round up the jews , romani and serbs who opposed the nazi occupation . 
  at least read your own sources . 
  just refusing facts all over the place lulz, 
   the ottomans had a much larger force . 
  recent studies and ottoman archival data state that there were about 50,000 -- 80,000 ottoman soldiers including between 5,000 and 10,000 janissaries , an elite infantry corps , and thousands of christian troops , notably 1,500 serbian cavalry that the serbian lord \u0110ura\u0111 brankovi\u0107 was forced to supply as part of his obligation to the ottoman sultan -- just a few months before , he had supplied the money for the reconstruction of the walls of constantinople . 
  again , what does 1 ' 500 forcibly taken serbian troops mean ? 
  that serbs did n't fight the ottomans for 100s of years ? 
  you 're being ridiculous . 
  everyone knows what response it 's going to yield because some people ca n't accept that there 's a legal entity called republika srpska . 
  not the poster 's fault . 
  you made this thread and brigaded it , that 's a completely different thing . 
  never happens , this greek ( flair ) guy is just all over serbs in every thread . 
  janissaries were made up of boys who were kidnapped ( blood tax ) at a young age and brainwashed to become warriors for the ottomans . 
  serbs were the first to receive autonomy , so they sure fought them . 
  that 's a little bit of an oversimplification . 
  it 's a meme created by random people because of [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocw3fbqpqku ) and it can really refer to any muslims ... like the ottomans . 
  meh , nationalists etc might , but it was mostly a thing during the war . 
  calling serbs mini russians is n't all that unheard of either . 
   even mladi\u0107 said before entering srebrenica that taking over the city and killing its people was the revenge for turkish occupation . 
  source ? 
  they were serbs , making it a serbian song . 
  ethnic serb `` lol '' he was born in the austrian empire, 
   we cover `` the serbian question '' in our history course and i 'm wondering if my education is actually relevant here . 
  wait what are you studying, 
  in all of austro-hungary actually :  after the balkan wars in 1912 -- 1913 , anti-serb sentiment increased in the austro-hungarian administration of bosnia and herzegovina . 
  oskar potiorek , governor of bosnia and herzegovina , closed many serb societies and significantly contributed to the anti-serb mood before the outbreak of world war i. 
   the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand of austria and sophie , duchess of hohenberg in 1914 led to the anti-serb pogrom in sarajevo , where angry croats and muslims engaged in violence during the evening of 28 june and much of the day on 29 june . 
  this led to a deep division along ethnic lines unprecedented in the city 's history . 
  ivo andri\u0107 refers to this event as the `` sarajevo frenzy of hate . '', 
  the crowds directed their anger principally at serb shops , residences of prominent serbs , the serbian orthodox church , schools , banks , the serb cultural society prosvjeta , and the srpska rije\u010d newspaper offices . 
  two serbs were killed that day . 
  that night there were anti-serb riots in other parts of the austro-hungarian empire including zagreb and dubrovnik . 
  in the aftermath of the sarajevo assassination anti-serb sentiment ran high throughout the habsburg empire . 
  austria-hungary imprisoned and extradited around 5,500 prominent serbs , sentenced 460 to death , and established the predominantly muslim special militia schutzkorps which carried on the persecution of serbs . 
   the sarajevo assassination became the casus belli for world war i. 
  taking advantage of an international wave of revulsion against this act of `` serbian nationalist terrorism , '' austria-hungary gave serbia an ultimatum which led to world war i. 
  although the serbs of austria-hungary were loyal citizens whose majority participated in its forces during the war , anti-serb sentiment systematically spread and members of the ethnic group were persecuted all over the country . 
  austria-hungary soon occupied the territory of the kingdom of serbia , including kosovo , boosting already intense anti-serbian sentiment among albanians whose volunteer units were established to reduce the number of serbs in kosovo . 
  a cultural example is the jingle `` alle serben m\u00fcssen sterben '' ( `` all serbs must die '' ) , which was popular in vienna in 1914 . 
  ( it was also known as `` serbien mu\u00df sterbien '' ) . 
   orders issued on the 3rd and 13 october 1914 banned the use of serbian cyrillic in the kingdom of croatia-slavonia , limiting it to use in religious instruction . 
  a decree was passed on january 3 , 1915 , that banned serbian cyrillic completely from public use . 
  an imperial order in october 25 , 1915 , banned the use of serbian cyrillic in the condominium of bosnia and herzegovina , except `` within the scope of serb orthodox church authorities '' .

  they actually believe this stuff  [ here ] ( http://prntscr.com/e93x5w ) are the four 1-star reviews on google . 
  poor things think the illyrians , who were extinct by year 200 , built this church that was built in the 1300s ... sheesh . 
  you 're the ones who got triggered over the republika srpska thread and decided to make this one and brigade it . 
  lulz, 
  well , seems like the rest of the subreddit sees it , i 'm fine with that . 
  mass downvoting because of bosnian flair ? 
  since when ? 
  you 're getting downvoted because you 're brigading this thread . 
  sad . 
  what makes me a nationalist or a troll ? 
  someone 's really bummed their brigade did n't go as planned . 
  i edited it just for you , you 're welcome . 
  that 's some interesting `` history . '', 
  the church was built by serbian ruler stefan decanski and it has never been converted to an orthodox church , that 's the way it was built in 1327 . 
  it 's today an official part of serbian cultural heritage according to unesco . 
  incorrect actually , kosovan means it pertains to the people or land . 
   well , i live in france , so maybe that 's why ? 
  you have a swedish flair - talk about double standards . 
  that 's an appropriate time to change your flair , huh . 
  i 've never sported another flair than this one . 
   did i ? 
  proof ? 
  first 5 comments in this thread were by you , onidsama , gamerhcp , lumbarspine , mintberrycrunch88 . 
  all 5 of you are members bosnian discord and you all commented within 7 minutes . 
  this together with the pictures i posted in my other comment [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5u3dqn/scenes_from_kosovo/ddr25sb/ ) really kind of seals the deal . 
   same goes for you . 
  you posted about some phantom brigade over 10 times based on one guy linking to a thread on here . 
  pathetic , really . 
  some guy stating he will make this thread , posting the imgur album before this thread was made , and several of you from the subreddit with your bosnian flair commented within 5 minutes . 
  it 's clear as day . 
  you changed your flair from bosnia to france , nice . 
  you participated in the brigade and i posted proof of the brigade in my other comment about the [ visoki decani ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5u3dqn/scenes_from_kosovo/ddr25sb/ ) . 
  not everyone in the discord participated , no one ever accused all the users of it . 
  you found some guy , who is not even a serb , suggesting that the serbian discord counter-brigades , something which no one else agreed on . 
  those three screenshots are of one and the same guy lol . 
  that fact that you 're still going is really sad lol . 
  his bih post consists of the same pictures as the original with 3 more added ( iirc ) . 
  it literally has everything to do with the diabolizing of serbia and serbs . 
  that 's why this thread , which was literally just a response to the srpska thread , became top post while the srpska post was downvoted out . 
   that 's actually true , kosovars were oppressed and wanted independence which they rightfully got , now i 'm not saying that they were angels , uck did some bad stuff but that does n't change the fact that serbs treated kosovars like shit and actually committed worst atrocities . 
  except history goes further back : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_massacres_in_kosovo  republika srpska is a state created through ethnic cleansing of innocent people . 
  no , it was created with the dayton accord . 
  yup, 
  yep , better hold on to your land in the future , 
  yep crimea isnt the best comparison . 
  i just read that she actually grew up in serbia and fled during ww2 ... wow . 
  e : upon further investigation , idk if this is true .

  but a lot of us do n't like the military . 
  one is n't derived of the other , they just both have the same origin . 
  the germanic beliefs in what is now germany and the netherlands did too . 
   but a few year ago , would you have considered the current events in ukraine to be plausible ? 
  the people who had actually read up on crimea would have thought it plausible , they have had pro-russian sentiment there since independence ( or lack thereof ) . 
  but it still was n't likely to happen , so no one actually thought much about it , the way russia did it was also fairly `` innovative '' as i understand it , so that 's another reason people did n't expect it . 
  not because it was n't `` plausible '' , just unlikely with our established understanding of things . 
  i feel the same way about the baltics , people are looking at it in the wrong way , if russia does something they wo n't do it the `` expected '' way , because their enemies are prepared for that ( a bit at least ) , and it would be fairly suicidal . 
  it 's the same in all bigger cities . 
  but in sweden ( and supposedly a lot of northern europe ) it 's everywhere , even small towns or villages , and at least in my experience that is n't the case in southern europe . 
  i like it the way it is exactly because of work . 
  now i have time to both earn a decent amount of money and have some time off . 
  4 weeks is less than most people work already , doubt they would be too happy to be forced to work less . 
   in that situation , not talking to strangers is often weird or hostile . 
  is that not so in finland too ? 
  im not from finland . 
  but you do n't talk to strangers even in small towns/villages . 
  obviously if you live in a small enough place it 's a good chance that you might know the person , and then you 'll probably talk . 
  but not with strangers . 
  it 's the same thing almost everywhere , not just bus stops , you never talk with strangers unless you have a specific reason . 
  and again , it 's not that you ca n't do it , some people still do , it 's just not normal . 
  in smaller towns , at most you might say `` hi '' if you pass someone in the street/on a path or that sort of thing , but you would not start talking with them unless you knew them or actually had something to ask them or whatever . 
  keep in mind that this is mostly a northern european thing . 
  the mediterranean countries are entirely different . 
  i have n't seen anything this extreme in sweden either , but i could definitely believe it happening . 
  we primarily do this out of respect of other people , do n't want to annoy them or something like that . 
  so you would most likely get a good response if you started talking . 
  we are n't that different from you guys , it 's just the norm here not to talk to strangers or intrude on their `` personal space '' , while in the us it is the norm to do just that . 
  there are people here who want to talk just like i 'm sure there are people in the us who do n't . 
  people would think you are a bit strange though , but it 's not like they would dislike you for it , i do n't think anyway , you would just be `` that foreign guy '' . 
   not even bars or pubs ? 
  how does anyone ever get laid ? 
  it 's fine in bars . 
  but even there i think it 's a lot less common than in many other countries . 
  the norm is to meet through mutual friends or hobbies or work or that sort of thing . 
  because it 's not , not traditionally anyway . 
  some estonians want them to move towards that though , because i do n't know , prestige ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_countries known as * norden * ( the north ) in all scandinavian countries , and something with a similar meaning in finnish . 
  i ca n't speak for everyone living here , but i believe at least in sweden it 's the sub-region of europe most of us see ourselves as living in , it 's used much more than [ * scandinavia * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavia ) ( which it is often mixed up with in english ) . 
  so yes , it is a region like the balkans for example . 
  fun fact : the swedish national anthem ends with `` jag vill leva , jag vill d\u00f6 i norden '' ( i want to live and die in the north ), 
  and most of the population in norrland lives by the coast , where it 's relatively warm . 
  there are still cities/towns inland though , even in the far north ( [ kiruna ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/kiruna_panorama.jpg ) for example ) . 
  i always saw it the other way around . 
  having * an * income compared to * no * income makes a lot of difference . 
  but if you earn * some * money or * a lot * of money does n't really matter much when happiness is concerned . 
  but there are n't any surviving speakers of most genuine swedish dialects , afaik . 
  even the old people nowadays are young enough to have grown up after they started forcing people to learn proper swedish in school . 
  yeah , but i at least have a vague idea about most dialects . 
  and i definitely know a lot about the ones around the area i grew up , and there are supposedly 3 or 4 different words there , and no * sn\u00f6 * , which is what pretty much all of them uses , just with some minor variations , like a slight diphthong or whatever on the \u00f6 , or that sort of stuff , never heard about anyone adding a v on the end at least . 
  yeah , that 's what i meant . 
  norway 's dialects are more different from each other than the swedish ones . 
  sax = scissor in swedish . 
  so saxons are literally known as `` scissors '' in swedish . 
  not sure if that is related at all , but now you know . 
  so the stereotypes are true ... 
  norway has a lot more different dialects than swedish . 
  sweden used to be more like that too , but that was over like 100 years ago , just seems odd to include those dialects on this map , they are never included anywhere else , since * literally * no one speaks like that anymore . 
  i could imagine gotland having their own one , as well as the ones up north ( do n't know anything about those areas ) . 
  but the 3 different ones in southern sweden seems odd , i grew up around there and only know about one possible dialect that could have a weird word like that ( listerl\u00e4ndska ) . 
  unless the \u00fd does n't sound anything like y and it 's just the regular scanian pronunciation of sn\u00f6 . 
  but that still leaves sn\u00f6v / sniv . 
  what 's up with all the different ones in the same language ? 
  i have n't heard that many variations in swedish . 
  https://sv.wiktionary.org/wiki/bira no idea where they got that from though . 
  same with b\u00e4rs . 
  i grew up calling danish beer pilsner . 
  did n't know it was a specific type of beer until quite late , thought it was just what danish beer was called . 
  except for * \u00f6l * , you can also say * bira * or * b\u00e4rs * in swedish . 
  according to wiktionary * bira * comes from german * bier * , and * b\u00e4rs * is a shortened version of * bayerskt \u00f6l * ( bavarian beer ) . 
  i think we win the `` most naked women '' award . 
  simple factory work , so pretty much the entire industry is situated in countries with cheap labour . 
  countries with cheap labour have a lot of children that need to work . 
  the reason these countries have so much child labour is because most of the population is incredibly poor , which means in many cases children has to work to survive . 
  there are not many other industries that rely on uneducated cheap labour to the same extent as the clothing industry . 
  and it 's a huge industry , so you hear a lot about it . 
  that 's the simple answer anyway . 
  i thought it was a really large truck driving past , haha . 
  http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/03/15/article-0-122bf49a000005dc-496_634x434.jpg almost, 
  i prefer trains over anything else . 
  the only advantage cars have over trains is that you can go wherever you want whenever you want . 
  but trains are much more comfortable to travel in , and you do n't have to drive them yourselves , so you can do other stuff . 
  i also do n't mind being near a train track as much as i mind being near a road , much more frequent noise from the road . 
  and rails take up much less space than all the roads we have . 
  and you usually see more nature while travelling by train than by road . 
  why does it matter ? 
  if he 's `` born and raised in estonia '' is n't he as estonian as everyone else ? 
  does n't most `` persian '' carpets look that way ? 
  arabs , i think . 
   because of the majority of the population there being ethnic russians also because most of those russians wanted to join russia , at least on paper ( even by western surveys ) . 
  and ukraine when it happened was in a bit of a crisis , not being able to do much . 
  as long as the baltic countries remain stable there really is n't much risk of the russians in those countries causing trouble , and russia really ca n't do anything by itself , it needs to primarily be the people themselves . 
  who knows what other shit can happen though , but the same thing as in ukraine would n't be possible . 
   the city 's population is listed as 264k on wikipedia . 
  60k of which live in the actual historical city , the rest live on the mainland . 
  anyway , never said there had to necessarily be more tourists than inhabitants for it to end up that way . 
  just that the ratio mattered . 
  i think it comes down to the ratio of tourists to natives . 
  when the tourists realise they are just visitors to a place where people live and work they tend to behave like normal people . 
  when they end up in places like venice it 's easy to start thinking like the entire place is there for the tourists , like a giant museum .

  can you blame them ? 
   why on earth would poland willingly abandon their own , maybe smaller but sea-worthy zloty vessel to board a burning ship at sea ? 
  they do right not to , certainly until the flames are out and that particular ship is burning so ever so fierce and bright . 
  you are preaching to the choir , but i wonder if the eurozone sees it that way . 
  no , it is not the companies responsibility to supply greece , or any other country for that matter . 
  even if it were so , i think the companies should should start with countries way worse off than greece like north korea , south sudan , kongo , burma etc. 
  it is the responsibility of the greek state , and if they ca n't manage that , they have to ask for help . 
  we ( sweden ) have that problem too , and the question is not if , but when our housing bubble is going to burst . 
  one thing that they have done is one can no longer borrow 100 % to finance buying a house/apartment , it is 85 % now . 
  anders borg , our finance minister is talking about more ways to stop people from indebting themselves . 
  how are the dutch going about this ? 
  it would be interesting to hear . 
  buying sex is illegal . 
   do n't tell me they were so naive as to expect their prosecutor to be an upstanding paragon of civil rectitude . 
  sort of yes , swedes can be very naive . 
  also , to a certain extent , those people i know in the legal system , do try to live `` legal '' lives . 
  i mean , no illegal maids , not driving to fast , not letting repairs be done illegaly etc.just because they know it has reprecussions if they do n't , or if it comes out . 
  and , frankly , if they ca n't follow the law , how can anyone else . 
  yes , it is a crime to buy sex . 
  personally i do n't like the law , but it is the law , which a prosecutor knows . 
   ` feminism ' now ? 
  men can sell sex too ... . 
  buying sex is illegal in sweden , and has been since 1999 . 
  whether one likes that law or not , a prosecutor can hardly claim ignorance of the law ( which is not a valid defence anyway ) . 
  a prosecutor , should follow the law , it is that simple . 
  i guess he will be fined , and maybe fired . 
  it will be interesting to see what happens with his career . 
  it was an interesting point of view , thank you . 
   can you show me some documentation that swedes lived in northern scandinavia before saami ? 
  n of course , but i think i have to give you some background on swedish ancient history first , since it odes not seem to be your forte . 
  so , northern europe , in particular the nordic countries were covered in ice , during the last ice age , around 11 000 years ago . 
  that ice slowly `` disappeared '' . 
  you can read about it [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/last_glacial_period#wisconsin_glaciation.2c_in_north_america ) ( scroll down to the weichselian glaciation ) . 
  the ice melted from the south . 
  that means , when people followed , they came from the south ( since one obviously could n't live on a several hundred meter thick glacier only ) . 
  by pure survival/geography , one had to come from the south . 
  it just struck me , that perhaps you do not even know that the sami people immigrated from the north ? 
  whether there were people there before the ice age , we will never know . 
  all possible traces disappeared under kilometers of ice . 
  those first people who came , slowly reclaiming the land from the south , were hunter/gathers , and they stayed hunter gather , particularely up north for a long time . 
  when southern europe were discussing plato , we were still hunter gatherers mostly . 
  and , when agriculture came , it came for where it actually could work , what is now scania , s\u00f6dermanland etc , in south of sweden - up north the swedes there stayed hunter gatherers . 
  if you have been to northern sweden , you can see it is not exactly the most suitable land for growning wheat/potateos - anything really . 
  also , like all hunter gatherers , they left fewer traces , and lived in smaller groups etc - that is the same story of hunter gathers everywhere , they do n't exactly build cities . 
  however , fewer traces do not mean any traces . 
  i think the oldest archeological evidence from norrland ( which is the part of sweden where the sami mostly lives ) is from around 7000-8000 years ago , and shows a traditional hunter gatherer society , who later supplements it with agriculture , but perhaps not agriculture in the modern sense . 
  and , what is important to our discussion , those traces , are not sami . 
  everything points to , logically , geologically and archelogically that sweden was populated from the south , but groups of hunter gaterers . 
  these people were not sami , and of course there a multitides of findings from this , obviusly not just one little stone ax . 
  also , the findings are over several thousands of years , it is not just one little hunter strolling by , people lived and died there for several thousands of years , and they arrrived as soon as it was technically possible , after the ice melted . 
  these people were the forefathers of the swedes . 
  at some point , several thousand years later , between 4000-3000 years ago ( they do not know when ) the sami arrives . 
  the archeologist can see this too . 
  they were also hunter gatherers , and they had reindeers ( but not in the way they have now , they just had 1-2 `` family '' reindeer ) . 
  so , they came way after the swedes . 
  what is interesting , is also that the sami folk tales , talks about the `` storvuxna folket '' - the `` big/tall people '' , who were there when they arrived . 
  so , as you can see , swedes were there first . 
  but please , do not take my word for it , here are some links to entertain you . 
  some of them you might have to run trough google translate . 
  interesting article in swedish about the new archeological findings in `` norrlands inland '' which is the inner part of norhtern sweden , probably around 2/3 of sweden actually . 
  he ( the professor in archeology ) claims they were not the first . 
  however , he ( like me ) think that is not relevant for the discussion , since if one has been somewhere long enough , they should have rights . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.namforsen.com/default.asp?path=22553&amp;pageid=32598 ) are some of the people he is referring to btw . 
  [ here ( http://www.tv4.se/sveriges-historia/artiklar/historieprofessorn-dick-harrison-chattade-med-tittarna-4fbfa82104bf725194004efb ) is a chat with a famous ( in sweden ) professor in history . 
  what i like is this answer to the question `` is there anything that supports the claim that the sami were the first people in sweden '' . 
  he answers - `` no , nothing '' . 
  [ here is another link that just confirms what i said , that the people came from the south ] ( http://www.solleftea.se/upplevagora/kultur/museergallerierkonst/sollefteamuseum/sollefteahistoria/deforstamanniskorna.4.7a37658d13ab861ebe835d.html ) [ here ] ( http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2fbf00996246?li=true ) is if you would like to bury yourself in the history of stone age northern scandinavia . 
  this confirms my claim , that the sami was n't there first . 
  [ here ] ( http://umu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:140134 ) is another thesis on that fact . 
   not that it matters , what happened before in the area is not relevant to evaluate the relation between swedes and saami , as i explained before . 
  oh , so you are now the leading expert of colonization ? 
  so , according to * you * , anonymous frenchmen , on the internet , all of a sudden colonization has nothing to do with who arrived first , it is all about how people are treated . 
  by that logic , has n't every single country colonized the jews ? 
  also , you go against the very definition of colonization . 
  [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colonization ) . 
  so , you are right , everyone else in the world are wrong ? 
   now you 're being disingenuous on purpose . 
  roman law was canon in medieval europe and their concepts were applied everywhere . 
  in particular the practice that romans had citizen rights , while the conquered people did not , is relevant . 
  roman cities there were called colonies , eg . 
  colonia agrippina ( k\u00f6ln ) . 
  ok , thank you for the history lesson . 
  i am learning spanish , so i am hoping that my knowledge about the latin languages ( as we call it here ) will improve . 
  fail to see the connection to the swedes/sami here though . 
   does it upset your black and white worldview ? 
  me , you are the aggressive one who makes up your own definition of stuff . 
  i honestly do not know why you are so hell bent on claiming something that goes against every archeologial finding , what we know about the ice age etc. 
  for the record , i do not in any way dispute that we have treated the sami people bad - we have . 
  i am just disputing that we are the colonizators ( is that a word ? ), 
  - since we were the first one there . 
  well , you should n't vote for lower taxes because it economics 101 , they do not have the financial back-up for that . 
  i think italians understand + and - as well as the swedes . 
  if you do n't have enough coming in , you can not expect a normal society , and certainly not lower taxes . 
  in particular when the economy is even shrinking . 
  do n't they care about the financing part ? 
  so , how do you expect him to fix the economy ? 
  so you think berlusconi is n't corrupt ? 
  is the media from abroad bought too ? 
  what i really want to know , how do you think he can get italy out of the financial mess it is in ? 
  i am learning spanish at the moment .

goddammit , i meant water melons, 
  one of the reason were getting all this is simply because of the backlash against years of the swedenistanization . 
  it has been know for * years * that there has been islamists in the green party . 
  it just so happens that the media was all hush-hush about it . 
  but now the winds have changed and all the mainstream parties are adapting the same policies on immigration that a year ago only the nationalist party advocated . 
  the green party are one of the last holdouts against these reforms and so now they need to be put down . 
  and their opponents are smelling blood in the water . 
  i 've heard it being described as a pumpkin . 
  green on the outside red on the inside brown at the core, 
  and dont forget the highly trained pizzatechnicians, 
  [ i told you to take care of him , not * take care * of him ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suygg4pmela ), 
  [ here is the channel \\ ( tv4 \\ ) itself reporting it , with the mail from the turkish embassy ] ( http://tv4gruppen.se/tv4s-medieblogg/valkommen-till-tv4-huset/mediebloggen/viveka-hansson/patryckningar-mot-tv4-fran-turkiets-ambassad/ ) [ the swedish newspaper aftonbladet ] ( http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article22692259.ab ) [ expressen ] ( http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/turkiets-press-pa-tv4-stoppa-dokumentaren/ ) [ dn ] ( http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/turkiska-ambassaden-ville-fa-tv4-att-slopa-dokumentar/ ) [ svd ] ( http://www.svd.se/turkiska-ambassaden-forsokte-stoppa-folkmordsdokumentar ) so . . just about every swedish newspaper , from the very left to the very right reports about this .

  yes , this year it is a really dull song , but the kid is charming and a overall good guy so i think thats why he won . 
  i remember reading a travel guide to japan some years ago . 
  the book mentioned that coffee came in two kinds , regular and `` american '' . 
  so i think every country except america brews their strong, 
  this needs to be raised to the top . 
  what if i told you that not all immigrants are from the middle east . 
  false . 
  only 7 % actually voted mp . 
  so 93 % didnt vote for this guy . 
  even if you throw in the 31 % who made it possible for l\u00f6fven to give this guy a minister post , that means there is still 62 % left who wanted someone else to rule . 
  probably one of the vegan options . 
  since it doesnt have any meat they must 've made the tomatosauce thicker by mixing in other stuff like corn and olives . 
  sweden [ pasta in a cup ] ( https://umeavegan.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/pastavagnen.jpg ) you usually have a choice of between 20-30 different sauces, 
  there is also the fact that `` assimilation '' is seen as a bad word in sweden . 
  it might stem from history where the governments idea of assimilation was to forcefully remove roma and sami children and rasie them as `` swedish '' so the expression that is preferred is `` integration '' instead . 
  its basically , `` i am gon na respect your culture and you are going to respect mine '' and that sounds all dandy and all except for that thing where it doesnt work . 
  looks great on paper though . 
  in the 1700s much more so than in the 70s , as finland was an actual part of the swedish empire . 
  it was a part of sweden for 600 years , while it has only been its own nation for less than a century . 
  many finns also speak swedish well enough and some even has it as their first language rather than second . 
  i have more ethnically , historically and culturally in common with an finn whom i have never met and probably will need to speak english to understand than my iranian dentist who has been in sweden for 37 year , more than half his life , and speaks fluent swedish . 
  until recently , we 've never had any cause to do so as we have been for a very long time a very ethnically homogenous country . 
  i guess thats changing now , though, 
  i am not talking about alternative medicines in general , but about homeopathy in specific . 
  while you are technically right , its not the point im debating . 
  except it doesnt . 
  it has proven to be no more effective than the common placebo-effect . 
  probably more like saying that northern ireland is part of great britain . 
  finland is part of fenno-scandinavia , but not scandinavia as thats only sweden-norway-denmark . 
  but its usually included because of its shared history with sweden , being part of it for 700 years or so . 
  just like iceland which was part of denmark until the 1940s but isnt technically scandinavian either . 
  just easier to say `` nordic countries '' though, 
  read the article . 
  he was complicit in murdering syrian soldiers . 
  so send him back to the syrian government . 
  he dont deserve to be locked up in * sweden * though , the crime was done in syria , so he should face justice * there * . 
  im still in a kind of shock that the paper reporting this is aftonbladet, 
  i think the difference between you and me is that i havent a read a much of the comic , so i just judge it on its own merit , and on those merits it is a fantastically funny show . 
  but you are also right in that this isnt lucifer-from-the-comics tv show , this is fox version of lucifer . 
  fox does this all the time . 
  i enjoy the x-men movies as much as the next guy ( i will even admit that the recent f4 had some interesting bits ) but they are not presenting the real characters but somewhat altered versions . 
  ( like wolverine in the wolverine who had no knowledge ( or cared for ) japanese table manner and couldnt speak the language while the comics version speaks it fluently and even trained with samurais and ninjas in the past . ), 
   i do n't think what held people back from trans-oceanic travel was really technology . 
  i 'm pretty sure the right kind of ships to attempt that sort of journey have been around for a long time . 
  people just never thought to sail endlessly off into the unknown . 
  they would n't know how much supplies they 'd need . 
  they did n't think there was anything out there at all . 
  people went to places they knew existed , they did n't just sail off into unknown waters . 
  its quite telling that a number of storys of discoverys starts off with `` discovered by x , when blown off course between place a and place b '' , 
  i usually dont follow police procedurals , ( only one i watch is castle because its pretty funny and full of nerdhumor . ), 
  but lucifer has grown on me . 
  i was hesitant at first as well but i gave it a chance and didnt regret it . 
  its a bizarre and outrageous idea , and somehow it still works . . ( then again , i also like babymetal which is a mix of metal and jpop * which really shouldnt be said in the same sentence * so maybe im just attracted to new and original stuff ), 
  that , or there is simply nothing left to tax . 
  chamberlain , then prime minister of uk , made the following statement in the house of commons already on march 31st , right after the occupation of chechoslovakia ang long before the molotov-ribbentrop pact  . . in the event of any action which clearly threatened polish independence , and which the polish government accordingly considered it vital to resist with their national forces , his majesty 's government would feel themselves bound at once to lend the polish government all support in their power . 
  they have given the polish government an assurance to this effect . 
   i may add that the french government have authorised me to make it plain that they stand in the same position in this matter as do his majesty 's government negotiations continued with meetings already in april , even if the actual signing of the agreement wasnt to be done until 2 days after the pact between germany and soviet union all that is inconsequential however as my point was to confirm that poland was viewed as powerful from a military standpoint at the time . 
  unless the opponents have a even stronger fleet . 
  hi vikings . . 
  funny thing about that is that one way i have heard it described is that as britain and france look around for another ally against hitler ( because they saw what was coming . . ) they decided on poland because they thought poland had a stronger army than russia against german expansion . 
  nobody saw the molotov-ribbentrop pact coming though . . or that russia decided that a soldier wouldnt have to be well-equipped to count as a soldier and that way could field a huge army . 
  another version that explains doing a cheer and the clinking is to make sure everybody drinks at the same time , so that nobody pulls out a knife and stabs you while your vision is obstructed by a huge twohanded mug of ale/beer/mead . 
  kind of funny to see how all these traditions comes from practices to prevent assassinations . . 
  the rally also had some rocks being thrown at a place where a turkish organization holds its meetings ( confirmed by police ) . 
  while this does not at all excuse the shooting , its easy to see how it could have been done in anger/retaliation . 
   fyi white people can go everywhere in malm\u00f6 unless theyre jews, 
  we did in no way `` go bankrupt '' . 
  there was a housing bubble that led to a bank crisis where the government had to go in and bail them out . 
  but the banks were already privatized , so what they did was actually to * nationalize * some banks until the crisis ended . 
  buying stock that they later sold at a profit . 
  we did lose a bit of our gdp and it did lead to a rise in unemployment as people stopped consuming and it got harder to lend money for some time . 
  this was caused by a socialist government though , but because of reasons different from what you might think . 
  the socialdemocrats decided to play right wing and * remove * regulations on banks because they thought in their hubris that swedens economy was so strong and impervious that it could survive anything . 
  secondly , you 're right that immigrants had nothing to do with it at that time , since the rate of immigration to sweden was still very low . 
  this didnt keep a right wing populist party with a anti-immigration agenda to briefly appear between 91-94 getting enough votes to get into the riksdag , but they never had any real influence . 
  i 've started to wonder if assad might not be the syrian leader we ( the west ) want , but he might be the one we * need *, 
  so you 're a nationalist and a socialist . 
  there should be a easier way to express this kind of people . . maybe if we put the two words together !, 
  national . . socialist . 
  hmm . . or maybe not . 
  eh , that would mean sweden would have to deport people coming here in the 70s and 80s . 
  most of them from other places in europe . . 
  and the gripen hasnt ? 
  the current iteration is the e-model . 
  `` dated '' ? 
  umm , the f 16 was introduced in 1978 .

  was great !, 
  i see he 's working hard on going out louder than i thought was possible ? 
  i am impressed !, 
  putin 's daughter lived in the netherlands until recently too . 
  funny considering how homogay the netherlands are . . russia has a history of the elite being at least partially abroad . 
  many writers etc fled to paris after tsarist russia fell . 
  a lot of academics fled after the ussr collapsed . 
  similar things will happen when shit hits the fan next time . 
  and that is not even a question of if but rather of when . 
  [ i fucking knew it lol . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4davvj/iceland_pm_i_will_not_resign/d1piwj3 ), 
  it 's only fair though . 
  why care about that useless list if you can have fairytales told on tv how grand your country is  . 
   most of us over here happen to take pride in our history , all of it . 
  so how is being proud of mass executions , gulags and other wondorous things is working out for you ? 
   germany average yearly consumption 1732,23 kwh for 422,32 $  ` merica average yearly consumption 4692,23 kwh for 408,88 $ germans also actually insulate their homes ... 
   i like big houses and living in the country . 
  the thing is , at least in w-europe the railroad and public transport is decent enough to make it a viable option to a car . 
  where my parents live ( country side ) they have a parking lot next to a bus stop so people can drive a few km to the bus stop and then get on the bus to get into town . 
  meh , like erdoganophobia or mugabephobia . 
  i do n't want my country to have such terrible leaders . 
  so putinophobia is reasonable in that context at least . 
   they see themselves as equals to usa but they are n't equal to the usa in any aspect but one - nukes . 
  the us has better * education * higher standard of living * less income inequality ( sic ! ), 
  * longer life expectancy * more patents * etc. 
  russia comparing itself to usa is pathetic . 
  a lot of bark and very little bite . 
  and their interests are not respected because they include [ kidnappings of foreign officials on foreign soil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eston_kohver ) . 
  they include invasion and annexations . 
  if their international policy is revolving around strongarming and bullying smaller nations around them , why are they so fucking surprised when people ask them to fuck off ? 
  famous last words . 
   at some point we have to address how often large , `` legitimate '' businesses not too long ago ( well , ok , fairly long ago now ) bribing was tax deductable in germany . 
  so i bet the corruption among legit biz is huge . 
  his approval ratings are in the basement already . 
  he called out nyt as being a russian propaganda arm . 
  no fucking way he gets re-elected unless putin helps him out by firing up the conflict again just in time for elections . 
  even then , people will probably elect someone else just out of spite . 
  shit man , he 's so uncomfortable it makes me uncomfortable ... 
  what opposite is happening , that citizens steal the `` rebel 's '' vehicles ? 
  really ? 
  they 're ruling themselves already . 
  `` nice car , random citizen , it 's mine now .

  i mean i rule '', 
  so edgy . 
  sounds an awful lot like the germans were thinking in the 30ies . 
  the most european eu country !, 
  that 's great and all germany , but when are you going to step up your internet game ? 
  or just redefine the infrastructure to include high speed internet . 
   0 % unemployment that is simply economically retarded . 
  in an ideal economy there is always some unemployment but the unemployed never stay in unemployment for long . 
  there * must * be competition for jobs , otherwise unreasonable things start to happen : 1 . 
  a professional can suddenly demand unreasonable salary . 
  in order to reach the 0 % you could be assigned to do really mundane tasks that actually do n't need to be done . 
   the u.s has a worse inequality than many european countries and russia has worse inequality than usa . 
  that ought to tell you something . . 
  judging from recent years ' events , ukraine does n't seem to be that interested in soviet ~ ~ russia ~ ~ union, 
  `` but only if i can keep my bmw '', 
  the fuel prices do n't care about ppp . 
  what 's funny bout the us electrical grid is that in some areas it 's cutting edge , while in others it 's lagging by decades . 
  take the fact that the us grid is n't synchronized yet , as an example !, 
   having a stable exchange ration to the currency of your biggest trade partner is helpful for business . 
  you have to keep in mind that the fluctuations are global . 
  a few years ago the usd was extremely cheap and now it 's very strong against the $ and the sek . 
  then to complicate stuff further , the currencies fluctuate in relation to each other . 
  as you say , currency inpredectibility is hard on business , but we 're not in the situation of ukraine , russia or venezuela where our currencies lose 50 % + of the value over night . 
  that 's not unreasonable since there is something of a devaluation war going on right now . 
  lower valued currency =  your country 's products are cheaper and more competitive on the market . 
  so currently there is an independently same strategy being persuaded by our central bank and the ecb . 
  easier said than done . 
  to do something else you need qualifications etc. 
  being a farmer in the first place makes it probable that you live on the country side with limited other business opportunities . 
  so you pros have to sell your home and move somewhere with your family . 
  i hope you understand how big this is on a personal level . 
  we have a sovereign currency and we 're in deflation half time time . . 
  our industry is booming like crazy . 
  as an engineering student i had 3 job offers before graduation . 
  note that i am not a spectacular student either . 
  i 'm not terrible , but still . . 
  furthermore our weakened currency against the dollar is n't really a hindrance either as it lowers our comparative pricing . 
  additionally , our government is taking in immigrants like crazy and is borrowing money and employing in the public sector currently . 
  so we have a boom currently . 
  some clouds on the sky are of course the long term plan for the refugees , our monetary policy is currently fucked and our housing market is absurd . 
   huge grain of salt more like a sack of salt ... 
   look at this case : * it 's an online personal feud taken too far , not evil government silencing critics * . 
  i dunno man , sometimes a cigar is just a cigar and not a conspiracy . 
  you are certainly correct . 
  i did not mean to imply that hurr durr evil kremlin is everywhere . 
  what i ment to imply is that laws are deliberately made vague in order to keep dissident in check by arbitrary enforcement . 
  this particular case is an example of arbitrary enforcement . 
  there is little chance that if a random ivan wrote `` god is dead '' in his vk that he 'll be prosecuted . 
   not that i believe the law about religious feelings is just or that russian police can be trusted , but this is far from just saying there is no god . 
  and , truth be told , if i heard `` go ahead , sue me if you do n't like it , '' i 'd be tempted to as well . 
  being an asshole is not really illegal , is it ? 
   this though is a showcase for the ineptitude of the local judicial system , not some of shady big brother machinations of the kgb . 
  do n't you think that laws are written vague with the very reason to be enforced arbitrarily ? 
  when there is a stupid law that everyone hates but is enforced uniformly , it is easy to avoid breaching that law . 
  when a law exists that is not enforced uniformly , but only if someone important is * maybe * offended , it will be enforced .

  at least i * think * i 've got relatives in finland . 
  i * must * have . 
  i just have no contact whatsoever with that part of my family . 
  i do have some contact with my german relatives , though . 
  i used to go down there for vacation every now and again when i was younger , even if it was a while since . 
  lovely bunch , they mostly live in bavaria . 
  i love it down there . 
  i have always really dug minority report . 
  it 's a perfect example of the type of science fiction i like best . 
  one of the funniest scenes , if you 're swedish , is [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d25deeokjoa ) . 
  i do n't know who the actress is , but the crazy doctor is peter stormare . 
  their swedish exchange is hilarious and the song she 's singing is absolutely bizarre given the context . 
  the lyrics are about small frogs looking funny , and it 's a traditional song that 's sung at midsummer . 
  i have no idea how any of that came to pass but i love that it did . 
  i did n't know it was swedish . 
  scandinavian , sure , but i always assumed that it was either danish or norwegian due to the name . 
  just to add to that , even in my little suburb ( 10 or so miles outside of stockholm ) there 's an indian restaurant . 
  i love it , even if the best ones are still in stockholm . 
  i thought about just copying my answer from another thread about the differences between different regions within countries , but it asked about more general differences , so i did n't focus on the people in the different regions specifically . 
  i did n't say too much about southerners because i 'm not sure how to sum up them , but i guess that the whole reserved/outgoing line that goes from north to south in europe in general is somewhat true for sweden as well - which would make southerners more open ( maybe ) and northerners more reserved ( that 's certainly the stereotype ) . 
  however , i do think that west coasters ( and gothenburgers in particular ) are seen as the most friendly among us , so that line might not be * entirely * true . 
  i have n't seen stockholm being compared to any city at all ( even if it does promote itself as `` the venice of the north '' sometimes ) , and i have n't been to north america so i ca n't make any comparisons of my own . 
  if anyone knows of cities similar to stockholm ( or any city in sweden ) i 'd be interested in hearing about it . 
  her refusal to answer offends you ? 
  also the constant jokes about swedes being [ swedes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rutabaga ) . 
  santa is just a remorseful viking , travelling around the world and giving back everything he stole way back when . 
  yeah , alaska is probably a pretty apt comparison . 
  you 're welcome back !, 
  i can recommend gothenburg on the west coast ( they are the ones stereotyped as constantly jovial ) . 
  and the further north you go , the more magical the landscapes get . 
  at least in my limited experience up there . 
  i do n't see how any of these opinions would get the cops called on you , unless you actively incite violence against the american government or something along those lines . 
  but you 're free to hold whatever opinions you want , however ridiculous they might be . 
  in terms of which of these would be socially acceptable , i think 4 is a no-brainer while 5 would be fairly accepted . 
  10 is tricky , since syria is such a clusterfuck at the moment . 
  just look at iraq and afghanistan - neither is especially stable after ~ 15 years of intervention , yet both were probably more `` fixable '' than syria is right now . 
  so while i think that there is a general sentiment that we should do something about syria , i doubt you 'd find support much for sending hundreds of thousands of troops there without a rock-solid plan . 
  i 'm also think that nato straight-up invading other countries in order to install a new regime is the wrong way to go . 
  it 's a defensive pact , not an offensive alliance . 
  i dislike the thought of the west , more or less united , going about invading sovereign nations just because we do n't like their leaders ( however horrible they might be ) . 
  it just seems like the start of something really , really bad . 
  the other points are either just weird or crazy , with some being both . 
  i do n't often see many `` stands '' of any kind , but i live right by a restaraunt that serves kebab in many different shapes , so i see the dish itself very often . 
  it has been too long since i saw it for me to give a really good answer to that , but i seem to remember a lot of characters being stupid for the sake of plot development , and the script asking a lot of semi-interesting questions that were never given satisfactory answers . 
  i basically liked the first third of the movie - the general setup of the movie 's premise - but not the middle act ( people being stupid ) or the end ( unsatisfactory ) . 
  i also really dislike the `` ancient alien '' type of stories that tries to redefine human history or evolution . 
  it * can * work , but rarely does ; and did n't , for me , in prometheus case . 
  but that 's more of a personal annoyance . 
  surstr\u00f6mming ? 
  agreed , but i have northern friends who somehow swear by it . 
  which is why everyone else think northerners are weird . 
  i have a weird tendency to dislike things that are typical for various holidays , such as porridge ( christmas ) and boiled eggs ( easter ) . 
  my dislike for eggs have waned somewhat as i 've grown older , but i still hate porridge with a passion . 
  last time i tried it i learned that i 'm more or less physically unable to eat it . 
  i also have no desire to try [ surstr\u00f6mming ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surstr%c3%b6mming ) , but i have n't actually eaten it so technically i ca n't say that i dislike it . 
  fair enough , then . 
  in my opinion ... well , let 's just say that i had higher hopes for the movie than it managed to fulfill . 
  well , to be fair , that says more about prometheus than about you . 
  there are a lot of different regions with different cultures , but i think it might be easiest to just focus on the differences between south , central and northern sweden . 
  south sweden is slightly warmer and closer to denmark ( both geographically and historically/culturally ) , which influences them a lot . 
  although perhaps not as much as non-southerners think . 
  central sweden has the two biggest cities , including the capital , which means that it gets a lot of focus . 
  it 's where most people who visit sweden end up , unless they either make a point of going to the far north or physically come from the south , via denmark , and opt to stay there instead . 
  especially stockholm also gets a lot of political focus , which can fairly justifiably annoy a lot of non-stockholmers . 
  the people on the west coast tend to be seen as very friendly , while people on the east coast are rude . 
  and finally the north . 
  people here are generally stereotyped as pretty slow . 
  not in the sense of being stupid , but more in how they act and speak . 
  but `` northerner '' is a pretty weird term , because it 's very vague . 
  what most non-northerners consider `` the north of sweden '' is actually most of sweden ( just under 60 % ) . 
  if you do n't live there it 's a fairly big chance you 've never been there , at least in my experience . 
  just to put things in perspective : the distance between stockholm and kiruna ( one of the northernmost towns ) is about the same as between malm\u00f6 in southern sweden and milan in northern italy . 
  it 's vast distances - at least in a european context - of mostly empty spaces and very little people . 
  the very north of sweden/the other countries up there is n't called `` the last european wildland '' for nothing . 
  i really like joakim th\u00e5str\u00f6m . 
  he 's a singer and songwriter who has been involved in several great bands and as a solo artist , and he has the greatest swedish voice in my opinion . 
  like th\u00e5str\u00f6m , i really like maynard james keenan and the various bands he 's been involved in , especially tool and a perfect circle . 
  i 'm not as fond of his mostly-solo endeavors with puscifer , even if certain songs are magnificent . 
  kent are great too . 
  they 've made 10 + albums of which i only like maybe four , but i on the other hand * love * those albums . 
  system of a down and deftones are two other favorites , as well as the swedish band khoma . 
  cult of luna if metal counts . 
  and then i have tons and tons of other bands i like in the genre . 
  too many to name . 
  i 've always been a fan of rock . 
  yeah . 
  and the knug . 
  they are insanely popular in scandinavia ( and would be on my list as well ) , but i did n't think they ever made it * anywhere * outside of our little corner of the north . 
  glad to see i 'm wrong . 
  i would n't have if it were n't for the fact that a lot of people tend to shit on the school for being overtly progressive , with a focus on gender studies and stuff like that . 
  i studied sociology so i only learned about those things tangentially , but overall the education did me good and i 'm glad i went there . 
  it * is * a not-ideal school in some respects , though . 
  just not for the reasons that are often put forth by people who dislike feminism etc. 
  oh , too many to count . 
  they usually involve danes , danish and either potatoes or porridge . 
  it might not sound like that could set up too many jokes , but you 'd be surprised . 
  interesting . 
  thanks for clarifying . 
  we do have some minority language news/tv shows , but everything else is generally in swedish . 
  so long as everything works as it should , it is what unites everyone regardless of their other languages .

  my point is that if that is the big nordic defence cooperation then it 's of to a really shitty start . 
  and your comment drives home my point , considering that you ( and norwegian media ) seems to see no fault in this not working on your side of the table . 
  the finish and swedish amphibian forces train together a lot . 
  and there is talk of exchanging officers for a deeper cooperation . 
  they recently made it possible for their forces to use the other nations harbours without governmental permission , i think . 
  is n't this mostly dead ? 
  all common purchase agreements died at least ? 
  norway did n't want archer , gripen or to buy the same trucks as sweden . 
  what is left ? 
  morocco are members of entso-e and the synchronized european grid . 
  so i guess they sent in a form applying for funding and their application was one of the better ones on the table at the time . 
  edit : [ here ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/node/102940_fr ) is the article from the comission on why . 
  [ here ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/node/102938_fr ) is the almost identical one about the funding of stage 2 in the same complex and finally [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/neighbourhood/neighbourhood-wide/neighbourhood-investment-facility/index_en.htm ) is an explanation on how and why we fund the well behaved neighbours of the eu addendum : it might be worth noticing that the noor project started as a kind of test site for the ( now defunct ) desertec project . 
  so there is another reason for the eu to take some responsibility for this specific project . 
  russia throwing money quite litterally in the sea is not a big concern to me . 
  how would stopping russia from building a new pipeline stop them from trying to fuck with everyone ? 
  all europe can do is view them as an unreliable supplier and build our infrastructure in a way that minimizes our reliance on them . 
  and if the fines are n't a big enough deterrent just negotiate bigger fines next time , if they are high enough you can buy lng for the money . 
  seems unlikely the transfer trough existing pipelines would cost that much . 
  and a quick look at the german gas-grid and markets makes me think that it 's not a monopoly . 
  so i see no reason to why they would take out that much . 
  the gas infrastructure in europe is quite extensive the pipeline trough ukraine is not necessary for transferring gas to the rest of europe . 
  especially if you include the storage to smooth the consumption spikes in winter . 
  so russia could choose to not send any gas trough the pipes in ukraine to try to create congestion and deficit in ukraine . 
  but i 'm unsure if that would work . 
  googling ` the guy who owns british media ' leads to this [ wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rupert_murdoch ), 
  what if all british instances has said that they need the approval of the parliament but the ecj say they do n't and the government activates article 50 without parliamentary support . 
  but that 's one of the rarer whether phenomena in the nordics . 
  and as it is now finland has a electricity deficit at most times . 
  having generation that fills some of that deficit does not harm at the time when it does n't . 
  plenty well considering the north of sweden have a lot of them and it 's the same climate . 
  that makes more sense than the ` some one is having a stroke , is it me ? ', 
  scenario i was considering . 
  except that is n't true . 
  [ wind passed coal a bunch of years ago ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electricity_sector_in_denmark#gross_electricity_consumption_.26_production_in_gwh_with_renewables_share ), 
  and how is any of the storage capacity or market access of those hydro facilities changed by letting the electricity price in austria and germany diverge ? 
  yeah . 
  or well if you consider the reservoir that the turbine stands on an integral part of the turbine it 's true . 
  100 anglo decimeters should be about 40 meters . 
   and the split actually is not a kick up the backside , au contraire - it takes away pressure to invest in the grid how ? 
  that makes no sense at all . 
  splitting a price zone into two does not disconnect them from each other . 
  it lets the price diverge creating more incitement to improve the infrastructure between them . 
  if the internal barriers of the german price zone is a hinder for a more integrated european market ( which it is ) it should be split . 
  a split would however be most effective if the line cut trough the congested areas , not necessarily at the same place as the geographical borders . 
  the water is not in the top of the tower . 
  it is in a 40m high reservoir at the bottom . 
  narwi linked [ this image ] ( http://green.streetsofeurope.de/wp-content/uploads/querschnitt-wea-wasserspeicher.png ) in the / r/energy thread . 
  nordstream when we stop using the gas . 
  you should really look up how the electricity markets work , it 's quite interesting . 
  the point i 'm trying to convey here is two fold : if we create a working market for gas in the eu it will self stabilize . 
  if anyone is offering gas at a cheap price at one point and an expensive price at another the cheaper will get to be sold and then all other actors on the market who are priced in between will get to sell before the expensive one . 
  so if russia tries to sell at a cheap price in germany and expensive in poland , russia will get to sell the cheap gas in germany and some of that gas will be sold to poland the back way . 
  now if the price that russia is offering in poland is over the market price for lng all storage facilities will sell their capacity before russia gets to sell any of their poland gas as they can import gas cheaper and the import capacity in western europe seems quite big . 
  the kicker is that any other situation creates price differences and if you tax transfers between areas with price differences you get a cash flow that you can earmark for removing those differences ( build more pipes ( or lng terminals ) ) . 
  my second and more important point is that this scheme is sellable and defacto eu already bought it . 
  what i described is the end-point of the gas part of the energy union . 
  eu as an institution and western europe as a collective will never buy the idea that the solution to a broken highly regulated market is more politics . 
  if poland want to solve this problem they have to sell an idea that the eu can buy and buy wholesale . 
  market deregulation is an idea eu loves , gigantic centralised governmental trade monopolies is not . 
  sorry for the wall of text . 
  i started and now i 'm here = / . 
  oh well time for fika . 
  but that 's the point . 
  we should n't force russia to do anything . 
  if we just force fair trading within the union and invest in infrastructure based on demand , russia will be forced by ` the invisible hand of capitalism ' and ours will remain clean . 
  if russia wants to sell more expensive gas to poland than to germany that 's ok but the market wo n't buy anything trough the russia-poland pipe for a higher price than the russia-germany pipe ( + regulated transfer fees ) . 
  the gasmarket should be deregulated into something comparable to the electricity market . 
  with transfer fees lowered to the actual maintenance cost , and a day ( or month ) ahead market deciding the directions and magnitude of flows , russia would be unable to fuck with individual nations . 
  which part of the eu is it that lacks democratic oversight ? 
  the parliament is elected , the council of ministers is the representation of the elected governments of the members , and the commission is elected based on the populations vote in the parliamentary elections ( same way most european nations elect their governments ) . 
  but how did you put any effort in to find these answers ? 
  the links / u/seefor posted is the first result if you just post your questions into google . 
  it 's sad and shitty that you ca n't trust your media to help you digest information any more , but was that a new revelation to you ? 
  what happens if scotland leaves the uk , stays in the european union and 10 year from now the shetlands want to join norway ? 
  that was implied as it was compared to the loss of jobs in the bank sector . 
  i do n't see you winning the race to the bottom against nations like turkey . 
  and i frankly do n't see you out teching the germanics . 
  but ok . 
  scandinavians usually talk about nordics not scandinavia . 
  finland is included in nordics but not in scandinavia but it gets confused since the locals use the terms interchangeably . 
  what effect will lead to more manufacturing jobs if i may ask ? 
  there is n't much to win for the eu in taking over frances place . 
  but then again it 's much more likely now then it was before brexit . 
  roof insulation is one of the easiest things to retrofit and [ typically repays itself in less than two years ] ( https://www.uswitch.com/insulation/guides/how-to-insulate-a-loft/ ) [ in average shitty british houses 10 % of heating costs can be saved by reducing draught ] ( https://www.uswitch.com/insulation/guides/draught-proofing/ ) i have no clue about the situation in poland but everything i have seen or heard from britain tells me that there are droves of low hanging fruit to pick in the home energy saving area in that country . 
  my experience with insulation is that changing a window or insulating an attic is a fun one or two weekends project and everything else is a real chore . 
  more insulation payes of for the consumer pretty quickly if you do it yourself . 
  it 's not like we are talking about passivhaus levels here . 
  we are talking about changing draughty shit-windows for good ones and maybe actually having some rock wool in the roof and walls . 
  you could start insulating your houses you know ... is triple glazing still considered some kind of luxury in gb ? 
  entso-e is one example . 
  i think the uk is some sort of member of nordpool also . 
  there is probably similar organisations for natgas and pipelines . 
  there are tonnes of weird eu and eu-ish organisations that are open for non-eu members . 
  that 's my guess from only watching that specific part of the video at least . 
  it was a joke about grammar . 
  / u/heathenbear s comment can be interpreted like ( s ) he only supports the protests if the women who protests if they have been ( or are being ) raped or if there is a risk to their mothers life . 
  you would get very few strikers if they had to fulfil that criterion to strike . 
  if i remember correctly the one in the museum here ( link\u00f6ping ) is from a paper mill ( or was it steel ? ), 
  in finland ( or maybe one of the baltics ) .

  better at balancing budget ? 
  ( no ) , better at health care ? 
  ( no ) , better at retirement ? 
  big things , that matters , not little , idiotic ones . 
  also , i most certainly missed how the united states of europe , that you promote , is going to be less corrupt than sweden . 
  you said it can be done , but refuse to say how . 
  how can you guarantee that ? 
   the lovely berlusconi and the lovely rajoy directly affect you in the current system . 
  the lovely berlusconi now controls 1 % of my money , not 40-50 % of my money , like you want it . 
  how stupid would i be to agree to that . 
  basically you seem to want to blackmail me into some sort of federal state , with the argument we are already corrupt and affecting you , so you * have to join * . 
  that is a really , really bad argument , if you do n't realise it . 
  is that truly the best argument you 've got ? 
  also - do n't you think we should be able to vote yes or not about it , or are you just going to force soverign states to stop being soverign states ? 
  how then ? 
  otherwise , the maastricht treaty is not going to be renegotiated anytome so , so put your dreams on hold . 
  or , do you mean that it will be renegotiated ? 
  when then ? 
  also , you never answered what the eu did better than my state , sweden . 
  i said , some research , i 'd like the trade union and stuff like education , but otherwise - what ? 
  finances and economics ? 
  environment - what ? 
   why ? 
  a more transparent and open political system does n't mean more gets spent . 
  you do not seem to understand what a federal state is . 
  the eu can be more open without being a federal state . 
  however , will not help the corruption in greece , italy , spain etc a federal state , what is what you are suggesting is something like germany or the us . 
  rather independent states , withing a huge state . 
  and yes , all of them pay something to the lines of between 30-70 % of their taxes to the federal government . 
  you are suggesting a federal government , which would mean a eu president , a eu finance minister etc. 
  in short , a united states of europe . 
  here , read up on what you are suggesting . 
  [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federation ) . 
  just a quote : * political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions united by a central ( federal ) government * so , you want all of the eu to give up their sovereignity . 
  good luck with that . 
  i 'll fight you until my dying days and i 'd much rather my country leave the eu , than not exists anymore , apart from some sort of `` north eu '' , where you can extract tax money from . 
   the big decisions are made in secret negotiations . 
  exactly . 
  you proved my point . 
  also , you did in no way calm my fears that sweden would be open to more corruption , you did n't give a single argument . 
  how can you guarantee , for the finns for example , that no more tax money will be spent in corruption , that no more shady deals will be taken , than now , when they are number 1 in the non corruption league . 
  how ? 
  i want you to extensively write about that . 
  oh , i say kex with a hard k. i just spelled it oddly . 
  i thought about it , the flower hundk\u00e4x , btw is spelled with an \u00e4 by me , even though i normally write kex . 
  interesting . 
  post that article about italy as an individual link , i am sure people will upvote it . 
  good news should be upvoted . 
  i had no idea that the irish debt/gdp ratio was so high , 125-150 % . 
  well , angela is n't saying , but everyone knows that the rich eurozone countries will have to pay off/forgive the indebted countries debt at some point . 
  however , i wonder how it will fly for the belgians , with a debt/gdp ratio of 120 % to start paying off someone else 's debt . 
  they do not seem to mind though , probably the finns will resist the most . 
  it will make for an interesting autumn though ( another greek bailout is due soon , is n't it ? ), 
  although i bet angela will do her most to delay everything until after the elections . 
  then they can continue with the bailouts , business as usual again . 
  why are you always want everything to be about spain ? 
  what is wrong with an article about france . 
  you often do this , ask why they do not mention spain . 
  i do not mind spain , but every article do not have to mention them , or make everything in comparison to spain . 
  haha , i had forgot how whiny the poles are . 
  thanks for remiding me . 
  i do not agree with you . 
  up until g\u00f6teborg ? 
  no , then you have n't seen the winters in sm\u00e5land , blekinge , northeastern sk\u00e5ne . 
  also , even in halmstad , the areas around there , it is a bit colder than denmark , which makes it a lot icier . 
  you might be right about malm\u00f6 , ystad , helsingborg and the area around there . 
  that is a it is a very small part of sweden though . 
  were they bailed out with spanish money or eu - money ? 
  a bit off topic perhaps , but he is privately rich , is n't he ? 
  i ca n't spell anymore . 
  recently i mixed up s\u00e4tt and sett too . 
  wonder if it is an early sign of alzheimers . 
  however , i wonder if k\u00e4x is n't one of those words you can spell in two different ways . 
  i agree with you that the structural regional funds are n't that effective and could be put to better use , but i think in this case , if i understand u/angryspaniard correctly , that spain paid for it themselves . 
  a bit high on the cheap credit perhaps , but still . 
  not more fun if you are a spanish person though . 
  i do know that the eu is only 1 % . 
  however , are you claiming that of the spanish gdp , only 1 % is corruption . 
  quoting from memory now , but according to transparency international , spain holds the 34 place , italy number 62 , and greece - was it 82 ? 
  compare that to finland , number 1 , sweden and denmark 5 and 3 , uk , netherlands and germany are all below 15 . 
  it is inevitable that an italian politician learn certain behaviour , it is also inevitable that some of those politicians and or accountants etc , or whatever it is , take it with them when they work for the eu . 
  and , personally i would n't vote for corrupt bastards , but rather evidently , a lot of people , particularly in southern europe have no problem with that . 
  how the fuck do you otherwise explain the fact that corrupt politicians like berlusconi and the greek ones not only get elected , but re-elected . 
  apparently , it is ok with corrupt assholes . 
  a federal eu would mean that the southern votes would influence my country a lot more . 
  no thanks , i have seen how they vote.ore of my money would go to brussels - to do what ? 
  a federal state would also mean that we would pay more to other states within the eu - forget 1 % . 
  more like 40 % . 
  look at the us where some states instantly pay for other . 
  why should one sign up for that . 
  thankfully we would need a new treaty for that and that is not bloody likely . 
  furthermore , i have seen how the eu handle things they are in charge of . 
  they are completely in charge of the agricultural politics and not only have the made a fine mess of it , they have also managed to discriminate us , sweden . 
  they have also been heavily involved in the economics of the eurozone , bailouts , austerity , bank saves etc - would you that have been successful . 
  i ca n't think of any area where the eu have handled things better than my country actually . 
  which areas would you say ? 
  i see that the eu has it benefits as a trade union , and in cooperation around research , education , etc. 
  however , claiming like you do that it will and should be federal - i 'd rather leave . 
  we say k\u00e4x in swedish , it is probably something germanic . 
  at least the are herbivores , one will survive .

they are a city-state inside the country of china you 're making an arbitrary disctintion here between country and state . 
  a state is a state . 
  whether it is a city or a large country is irrelevant . 
  taiwan is indeed a state and it conducts its affairs as such . 
   it 'll never join the united nations except it was a founding member of the un . 
  it was kicked out * after * the fact , in 1971 , as part of nixon 's rapproachment to china . 
  but that technicality does n't materially impact taiwan 's efforts to make diplomacy as a sovereign state around the world . 
  it has de facto embassies all over the planet . 
  i 'm not sure how this is new . 
  merkel and the gang have said for months that they wo n't accept refugees from the balkans . 
  i would also argue that the countries selected among the non-eu states are very arbitrary . 
  living in pakistan today is often as dangerous , sometimes more so , than living in iraq and especially afghanistan . 
  eritrea is a military dictatorship but so is belarus . 
  would germany blindly accept people and/or dissidents from belarus ? 
  i do n't see that right now . 
  overall , merkel is trying to massively increase asylum immigration under the pretense of `` showing our humanity '' but her own statistics show that there is no real pattern here . 
  and if you just want to bring in more people to nation that has the [ lowest birth rate ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32929962 ) in the world , it makes a lot more sense to bring them in from culturally close countries . 
  i do n't care what the leftists who hate people from balkans here say , but nobody is going to make the case that serbs or albanians are harder to integrate than eritreans or iraqis and escape massive mockery and derision . 
  well done , meeting facts with ad hominem attacks . 
  are n't you a sight to behold ? 
  i heard the leftists in hungary are basically really unpopular ( i wonder why ? ) . 
  well at least they can count on support from random redditor from latvia . 
   but foreign investment and easy foreign loans are fine , right ? 
  why do people keep bringing up this idiotic argument ? 
  serious question . 
  foreign investment can be taken back just as fast as it has been pouring in . 
  you just stop investing . 
  done !, 
  you ca n't `` take back '' a large 3rd world population once it is settled . 
  just look at my country . 
  these decisions are essentially irreversible unless you 're going for large scale ethnic cleansing , which is n't exactly the democratic europe we want . 
  so again : why do you try to equate these issues when one is temporary and the other is permanent ? 
  it 's an idiotic and incredibly stupid argument from start to finish . 
   do you really think tesla built something the armies of engineers in germany and japan could n't build ? 
  you 're missing the point here . 
  the co-founder of tesla , marc tarpenning , [ has said ] ( https://youtu.be/hf15nmnayxk?t=16m20s ) that in the last 30 years , most of the car companies have outsourced most of their car parts . 
  the only thing that differentiates the car companies is their ice ( internal combustion engine ) . 
  most of those companies have decades of sunk costs in those ices and which is why they are probably going to move a lot slower than even someone in the ev industry like martin estimated , a point which he later makes . 
  you do n't ditch hundreds of billions of euros of business into ices overnight , especially when you have entire engineering teams built around these legacy , 100 + year technologies . 
  further , an ev is more than its engine . 
  think of how tesla continually updates its vehicle . 
  just recently they added piloted automated driving . 
  there 's still no other ev either in production or planned which matches that same ground-up digital-first mentality . 
  why ? 
  because tesla built their model from the ground up , instead of trying to shoe-horn it into an old legacy model . 
  the big car companies from germany and japan do n't have that luxury . 
  if they abandon their old models , they will bankrupt their companies . 
  if they try to fight the ev battle with faulty assumptions , you get the mediocre toasters on wheels that they are currently offering . 
  the only thing stopping tesla from cannibalising them is the fact that tesla is supply-constrained . 
  the model x is sold out all the way to h2 2016 already , and it 's not even launched yet . 
  now think how popular the model 3 would be compared to the crappy prius or half-assed e-golf attempts from vw . 
  that 's why we 're all waiting for the model 3 . 
  i hate to admit it , sometimes you even make me [ jealous ] ( http://ecomento.com/2015/08/06/norway-all-new-cars-electric-by-2025/ ) . 
  kisses , your big brother . 
  well , it 's okay , because like everyone else in sweden i can never understand a word of danish even if you can understand us . 
  that linguistic power differential is real , bro . 
  so which other european countries would you classify as ` southern but not mediterranean ' ? 
  or did you make up a category just now for portugal alone ? 
  oh , do n't blame the polish , anglo man . 
  what they are doing is still better than allowing the wholesale theft of an entire industry like you have . 
  how many of `` your '' car companies are owned by native brits again ? 
  please remind us , 
  and coming faster to market . 
  thanks for free laugh :d, 
  `` protester '' seems a bit too neutral as a description . 
  those jackboots and military gear suggest a fairly far-right gathering . 
  anyone knows that flag on the right ? 
  is it neo-nazi or at least used in those contexts ? 
  but the question was n't about what is news , it 's about country stereotypes . 
  there are plenty about poland , both positive and negative , and which one of the most common ones do you also think is wrong , either entirely wrong or partially wrong ? 
  contribute !, 
  i 've been to belgium twice and it 's basically the only place where i see waffles being sold on the street for ` normal ' people . 
  i 've seen waffles being sold at tourist locations in other countries but not in everyday streets like in belgium . 
  so while you may not eat it as often as people think , i 'm willing to bet you still eat it way more than other countries !, 
  also , i 've noticed people eat mayo with literally * everything * in belgium . 
  is this also something you 've noticed or did i get a niche view ? 
   oh , you are one of those `` the only difference between men and women are penises and vaginas '' muppets nope , i believe in biological differences between sexes , such as difference in testosteron which in terms affect competitiveness . 
  nice wishful thinking , though  also , even if you have a 100 % biological view on differences between sexes , that still does n't explain away the sharp differences between swedish women 's success in the top echelons of their society with that of american women . 
  so your comment changes nothing on this fundamental issue . 
  by the way , is n't it time you talked about your own country instead of turning this thread into a pro/anti-feminist thread ? 
  stay on topic !, 
  oh do n't get me wrong , it is by most measures !, 
  i 'm just questioning the `` we are the bestest ever and everyone else sucks '' hivemind mentality in sweden when it comes to gender equality . 
  feminists often make the point that we as a society have double standards for women and men when it comes to success . 
  men are allowed far more social space to behave like , frankly , assholes , as long as we are successful . 
  we are being called driven , ambitious , `` hardnosed '' . 
  all these have positive connotations . 
  women are instead denigrated as ` bitches ' and unpleasant . 
  not just by men , often by women too . 
  so a society 's test of women 's equality ca n't just be basic stuff like education or superficial access to the job market . 
  it also has to be judged how it handles high-performing women . 
  and my point was , sweden in this regard lags ** far , far behind ** many other supposedly `` right-wing '' and `` backwards '' countries in the world . 
  yet that fact does n't seem to disturb the `` we are the bestest ever on women 's issues '' mentality in sweden . 
  it 's simply not a concept that aligns with the general understanding of where we are as a society . 
  from the article :  although the cars ** wo n't be manufactured in tilburg ** , the battery pack , power train and rear axle will be installed there , ** coming from the firm 's hq in fremont , california ** . 
  the car 's first firmware upload will also be carried out on site , before each car undergoes a rigorous quality control assessment . 
  so it 's more of an assembly plant and a final testing site than an outright factory . 
  still , good news for those of us who are waiting for the model 3 . 
   `` think critically '' is a meaningless statement if you are only going to think critically on things that dont fit your agenda as well . 
  reddit has a problem with thinking saying `` be logical/critical '' and actually doing it are the same thing .

  do n't be silly it 's a fact that most ( more or less all ) beggers in sweden are ethnically roma from romania . 
  i do n't hate them and i doubt user fhmange does either . 
  [ hhnngg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhhllcnipec ) [ h-hhnnnhh ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7h0he5us_qg ), 
  i would say stockholm or \u00c5lesund in scandinavia, 
  no only london and oxford . 
  i do n't think they bother , they suddenly become very lgbt aware when the muslim community is the one discriminating but otherwise i honestly do n't think they care much . 
  with `` some swedes '' they mean an african-swedish rapper who is going on about a lot of imagined slights against minorities . 
  the vast majority of swedes like finland just as it is , maybe with less alcohol and knifes but you know . 
  - tough on crime - support the `` traditional swedish culture '' - strengthen the welfare state - lower taxes ( they can afford to both this and above if they cut immigration costs ) - conservative values like family life and such, 
  you know all these `` quality-of-life '' or `` liveability '' indexes , they almost always put vienna in the top five . 
  now i 've never been but i think it looks nice , i can imagine the locals being a bit difficult though and i 've never even heard of austrian food but muslims are something you have to deal with all over the continent nowadays so . . 
  i 've been to london and thought it was clean , modern and friendly but i kept to the inner city i guess . 
  also been to oxford and i liked it honestly , there was a beautiful park next to grand old mansion and i saw a large rainbow through the light rain when i entered . 
  copenhagen , there were danish people * everywhere * . 
  seriously though i lived in brussels a while when i was a kid and i remember it as dirty ( in an icky kind of way ) , noisy , crowded , lousy weather and it looked kinda run down . 
  i remember i visited antwerpen though and thought it was such a nice city , especially the trains were very nice i thought . 
  recently had an election but the way things are looking the anti-immigration party ( sd ) will rival the two traditional `` state-bearing '' parties . 
  sd has been growing exponentially since 2002 and it would n't suprise me if they doubled their support again in 2018 . 
  i wonder how it turns out , any predictions ? 
  lol @ gothenburg having higher purchasing power than stockholm . 
  interesting otherwise , suprised at paris low ranking and i also thought trondheim would do even better , visited last week and it was great . 
  good riddance . 
  during the transatlantic migration the annual increase in us population from immigration was something like 0,7 % and that changed the country profoundly . 
  0,5 % every year might not sound like much , but it is . 
  a sizeable muslim minority has appeared in europe in a relatively short amount of time . 
  in a historical context the europeans are proving quite tolerant of their new inhabitants . 
  it 's sort of a satire though , the singer posts in the comments that he wanted people to reflect on how shallow todays youth is . 
  probably because europe is becoming progressively more racist . 
  we are neither east nor west it seems . 
  hopefully he gets rehabilitated . 
  should n't it be kind of in the middle of all four nations though ? 
  i 've thought the same thing actually . 
  [ it 's not your fault ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtkst5-zfhw ), 
  it 's an incompetent institute is what it is . 
  http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2fa%3a1008713631586 http://www.geocurrents.info/geography-of-crime-and-punishment/misleading-murder-and-rape-maps-and-the-the-sweden-rape-puzzle even if you dislike facts and understanding what statistics actually describe , you 'd think that it would be common sense that sweden is n't more violent than egypt or ethiopia . 
  also this notion that murder rates are low but apparently sexual crimes are the highest in the worls is ludicrous . 
  you finns should just grow up and come back home , your teenage rebellion is over - all is forgiven . 
  where would the capital be ? 
  we could build a new one , call it * scandium * or something . 
  oil prices will rise sooner or later . 
  norway has been very responsible with their resource generated wealth and they will remain the richest scandinavian country for the forseeable future . 
  there is no minimum wage in sweden , immigrants either get a job on the same conditions as a swedish worker ( high wages , extensive protecion , lots of benefits ) or they end up unemployed . 
  guess which ? 
  that 's the european project man , brings a fucking tear to my blue eye . 
  no i 've just had an upset stomach for the past week ( coincidentally since i upped-the-ante on my croissant consumption ) and i never knew why , thanks mate . 
  wtf , how did you know , seriously ? 
  heh , yeah those violent kind of strikes like the one in calais recently would be counterproductive in sweden . 
  the french lifestyle has its allure though , i eat at least three freshly baked croissants every morning . 
  thanks man . 
  that 's why the uk will be europe 's largest economy in one or two decades . 
  when using an absolute measurement [ sweden has the lowest poverty rate in the union ] ( http://www.scb.se/en_/finding-statistics/statistics-by-subject-area/living-conditions/living-conditions/living-conditions-surveys-ulfsilc/aktuell-pong/12209/behallare-for-press/living-conditions-survey-ulfsilc1/ ), 
  intriguing of course but politically impossible i 'm afraid . 
  we 're just a decade behind denmark , it 's more or less an inevitable development . 
   this section is based on surveys from visitors of this website . 
  do you have anything more robust than what people on one website claims ? 
  it 's surprisingly hard to find legit comparisons between countries . 
  i can read all about crime in sweden [ here ] ( https://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home.html ) or in [ this ] ( https://www.bra.se/download/18.5e2a4a6b14ab16675996b3/1422267858456/2015_1_crime_survey_2014_summary.pdf ) survey but i do n't know how to compare it with denmark or how to look at malm\u00f6 and copenhagen indivually . 
  anyway if you 're really driving the idea that sweden has something of a crime problem compared to denmark then i do n't buy it . 
  homicide is mostly comparable and the rate looks like [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/e/e7/homicide_rate_per_100_000_population%2c_average_per_year%2c_2005-2007_and_2008-2010.png ) other offences are prone to local legal definitions and such . 
  i doubt it , what 's the source ? 
  not only that we actually file murder cases differently than other states , i got this from wikipedia :  studies of lethal violence in sweden have shown that more than half the reported cases were not actually cases of murder or manslaughter . 
  this is because the swedish crime statistics show all events with a lethal outcome that the police investigate . 
  many of these reported crimes turn out to be , in reality , suicides , accidents or natural deaths . 
  [ 23 ] [ 27 ] despite this statistical anomaly , sweden has an internationally low murder and homicide rate, 
  secular muslims are no more of a threat than secular christians . 
  religious fundamentalists that i can do without . 
  they work and pay taxes in norway no ? 
  norway has a lower tax level than us , fremskrittspartiet has its roots in the anti-tax movement . 
  muslims have had a pr problem since 2001 really . 
  so now the subreddit feed needs more victimized immigrants to balance things out ? 
  i think that 's a bit petty , why you got ta shrink to the xenophobes level ? 
  that 's more like it , got ta keep up appearances . 
  norway and denmark , finland is n't for everyone but especially the nature can be breathtaking and helsinki is nice . 
  what are germans doing about this , is the country satisfied with a shrinking population ? 
  that swedish women are much sexier than other countries . 
  they 're blonder , taller and quite well dressed other than that i have n't notied much difference in attractivness . 
  what are some of the hot issues in denmark right now ? 
  in sweden it 's : - immigration - welfare benefits ( as always ) - unemployment, 
  it varies between measurements , [ this ] ( https://www.google.se/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gnp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;idim=country:swe:nor:fin&amp;hl=sv&amp;dl=sv#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:swe:nor:fin&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=sv&amp;dl=sv&amp;ind=false ) graph from the world bank shows how norway passed sweden in 1992 . 
  i 'm not informed enough to state any absolute conclusion though . 
  no i was n't aware, 
  large banking sector combined with a small population equals a lot of financial assets per capita . 
  really ? 
  i always thought norway was relatively poor by nordic standards before * olje\u00e4ventyret *,

  do n't ruin my sweg, 
  we 've become more or less immune from being exposed . 
  is n't he mocked in britain as well ? 
  get on our level , or you rather should n't actually, 
  this should be one of the things the eu could be able to fix , we certainly could use the economic boost of easier trade and an even more unified market . 
  so what does this mean , our elders work harder than anyone else 's ? 
  it 's the swedish way . 
  no but seriously if there is anything fucked up about this place it 's how the immigration has been handled but it 's not even close to being as bad as some morons would have you believe . 
  this rape thing for instance is utterly silly and it reeks of repressed cuckold fantasies being projected by some smelly neckbeard overseas . 
  they 're just projecting their own fantasies, 
  from uppsala, 
  what constitutes a sexual offence ( or even rape ) varies between countries , in sweden that stuff can cover a lot .

  good , it 's really horrible how we are overfishing and abusing the oceans . 
  and i do n't particularely like when we just move the responsibilty away from us/europe and keep overfishing , just outside of poorer countries this time . 
  ok , sorry , i did n't know that . 
  i think you need to have your education first , then you can apply for the job . 
  i know like it engineers are quite in demand here in sweden ( any engineers really ) and ( mostly ) you can get away with english . 
  other parts of europe has much higher unemployment though , so if i were you i 'd head to each individual subreddit and ask . 
  times might not be the best for you to go to portugal , greece etc , where they have really high unemployment . 
  i think it depends on the country . 
  in my country i think it 's fairly easy for them to find a job ( sweden btw ) and the job security is fairly high i suppose . 
  do n't really know about other countries . 
  edit : of course they have to speak fluent swedish though , and have an education that is the equivalent of what we have . 
   i really wonder how you feel threatened in away what so ever way , did i say anything offensive ? 
  i had answered tagami who claimed that the * main fault * was the european firms , not the greeks . 
  i disagreed with this , and to prove my point i had two articles that pointed out that the corruption was rampant and everywhere , they had a huge shadow economy and tax evasion was done by everybody ( + one about their place on the corruption list ) you answered that with :  if you think uncollected income tax from some people who make 600 euros a month is responsible you are surely mistaken . 
  mistaken how ? 
  i had never said that collecting income tax from people who make 600/month is responsible , so why do you claim that ? 
  you `` accused me '' for lack of a better word , of something i had never said , nor is it mentioned in the articles . 
  you seem to be having this argument in your head with me , based on the fact that you have a nice friend there , while i am trying to argue that statistically , millions and millions of greeks cheat . 
  that said , in one of the articles it 's mentiond that they start paying taxes at $ 12 000 , something that does piss me of , since we start paying at about 1/7 of that . 
  so yes , they should start paying at 1800/year too , so your friend should pay it as well . 
  i work as a dog too , and i pay taxes , why should n't they ( since we give money to them ) . 
   i have a friend who 's 23 , is from a tiny mountain village , works like a dog in the closest `` city '' available , and makes end 's meat . 
  and because of that you claim that they should pay less taxes than i , that their shadow economy really is n't any fault of their own ? 
  i have assumed that since you argued with me , that you disagree with the contesnts of the articles , but if that is not the case , sorry . 
  if you do , just please provide me with sources . 
  they argument i am having is that they should pay as much as least as we do , not cheat and accept that they are responsible for their own mess . 
  they got into it , and they can also get themselves out of it , i 'm sure , but it does n't work if you blame it all on foreigners . 
  one has to take responsibility for one 's situation . 
   the last thing i 'll say is you 're right , corruption is everywhere , all over the world , so do n't just look at it exclusive to greece . 
  greece is number 80 on the list and they are * receiving money * . 
  most of the other `` first world countries '' are not there , so no , it is exceptionally bad , unless one compares them to moldovia , albania or bulgaria . 
  the us is number 24 and germany is 14 . 
  they are the worst in the eu , apart from bulgaria . 
  corruption is in every country , but in greece it seems to be everywhere . 
   unfortunately i do n't have time to read the articles ( does n't it suck that university gets in the way of more important knowledge ) , but i do read both sides of the story when i can . 
  so why are you attacking me with this $ 600 euro then ? 
  why not wait until you get home , read then instead of claiming that i have said something that i never have ? 
  you attacked me with numbers based from your head . 
   i was n't referring to the articles you provided , it was just based on an average of friends and family living there . 
  well , provide sources please.how on earth am i suppose to know what you are talking about . 
  how is that a ) in relation to the articles b ) where does that number comes from ? 
  oecd reports ? 
   first off i assume there are n't that many people who make 1800 a year in sweden ( right ? 
  ) , are you talking about 18 year olds ? 
  i was comparing it to greece - and the articles i pointed out . 
  i , as a working student start paying taxes as soon as i make more than $ 1800 per * year * . 
  in greece , you start paying when you make something like * 12 000 * / year . 
  i 'd never ever have to pay taxes if we had your system , . 
  also , i support greece , why ? 
  do n't tell me their tax evasion is minor , it 's a lot of bloody money for me to pay taxes , and i do n't see a single reason why i should give money to someone who cheats . 
  it is not minor !, 
   what i meant was the tax being paid by those who make that much ( even up to a more reasonable low income ) can not attribute to the deep corruption in greece at all . 
  it 's more important on a basis of principal if anything . 
  if greece started to pay the taxes you 'll have no more budget deficit . 
  it is not minor . 
  your level of start paying taxes is absurdly high , you have to lower it . 
  second , in those other articles as well ( and i can provide you with an endless number of links as well , but i 'll wait ) it prove that the corruption is everywhere . 
  an example , of the top of my head is that greece has a barely functioning state ( according to oecd report ) but 700 000 people who work there . 
  that is just not the politicians . 
  also you do not get a shadow economy of * 25 % * ( !!!!!! ), 
  because of the politicians and foreign firms . 
  i can provide you with link after link of corruptions among ordinary people , and no , since it 's everywhere it 's not minor - it 's everywhere . 
   if you think uncollected income tax from some people who make 600 euros a month is responsible you are surely mistaken . 
  hmm - where in the articles do we talk about $ 600 ? 
  second , in my country who has has given money to greece ) we start paying taxes at $ 1800/year ( ! ) . 
  second - the articles i have linked to are for example about the * deep * corruption in greece , and the fact that the shadow economy s * 25 % * . 
  also , the articles talk about the tax evasion and the corruption that is * everywhere . 
  you clearly show that you have not read the articles , nor are you willing to understand . 
  how you can reduce that fact that you have a shadow economy of 25 % , tax evasion that is everywhere and the fact that you are number 80 on the corruption list to a witch hunt after low income people , just proves that you are not willing to let greece take any responsibility for anything . 
   you are focusing on the wrong part of the equation . 
  it is not the guilt trip that is important , no-one is saying that greece is not at fault . 
  it * is * important . 
  you said * the main culprits * were foreign firms . 
  that means that you are absolving the blame from the greeks . 
  the one who caused this , and the ones who can fix this , is the greeks . 
  if you keep blaming others , you do not take your responsibility , nor do you embrace the changes you 'll have to do . 
   what you should be focusing on is the after effects of the continued and prolonged punishment . 
  i agree that it 's not fun for the greeks right now , but what do you mean is the punishment ? 
  that your pensions are lowered ? 
  they were the highest in the oecd !, 
  that you 'll fire 150 000 civil servants ? 
  according to another oecd report you have a barely funtioning state , although you have 700 000 civil servants . 
  what do they actually do ? 
  why have you been paying them for all those years ? 
  why do you keep people that do not work ? 
  i can understand that things are not fun , but no one forced you to raise salaries , to avoid building up competetive industries , to raise pensions , to retire earlier , borrow money , constant budget deficit . 
  i am stunned , and chocked when i see greeks protesting things we 've had for decades , like property tax , retirement at 65 ( we have 67 ) , higher taxes ( you are still lower than ours btw ) , higher vat etc. 
  so , is the punishment to have things like we have them ? 
   most of the noise about nazis is really the media projecting ( and trying to shift cause-effect externally ) because the people of greece are torn and there is too much internal strife , so an external enemy is sought to focus on that ( does that remind you of something ? ) . 
  i suppose you are referring to the 30 's and the nazi , and a ) * all * countries do that in time of crises , and , as i did point out earlier , i do n't think * all * greeks agree with what some papers say b ) i am not german . 
   the fact that no-one is accepting ever the ( even minor ) role these german corporations played in the whole shebang just allows more false justifications to enter the game . 
  i * do * accept it ( as with goldman sachs , french banks etc ) but what your wrote were * greece 's corruption was facilitated mainly by siemens and other western europe corporations , * the keyword is * mainly * . 
  you are saying that more than half of the blame lies outside of greece . 
  and , i say that is wrong . 
  not saying that they are perfect , but mainly * the greeks * are to blame . 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weimar_republic i honestly i have no clue what you mean with this ? 
  are you saying that you are going to turn into a fourth reich ? 
  you also implied that `` those who do not know history tend to repeat it '' . 
  is greece turning inot weimar and then you 'll try to take over the world ? 
  or are you trying to imply that i as a german ( which i am not , one can think the greek references to nazi 's are wrong anyway ) should know this?or are you implying that the germans are trying to invade you ?

  i do n't care if mcdonalds opens a regional headquarters in sweden . 
  i do care if cia agents are allowed to spy on our population with our government 's consent , which has happened in the past ( and is the topic of this thread ) . 
  i 'm talking about the actions of the american * government * not that of its individual nationals or corporations or organisations that happen to originate from there . 
  for the military stuff it is an open secret that sweden relied on assumed american help in the event of a war with the soviet union during the cold war . 
  the swedish military was an impressive one in its own right during the period , especially the airforce , but there was never any doubt that sweden would in the case of a soviet invasion be expecting help from nato . 
  this is not the case any more but it certainly was historically . 
  the hypothetical war never happened though so of course there are no historical events to point out . 
  ww2 is a lousy example . 
  the period i 'm talking about came after that , and the usa was n't even a proper global superpower before that war . 
  of course sweden did n't need or ask for help from the usa in the 1930s : the usa was an isolationist state at the time !, 
  well , the inuit were pretty aggressive in their expansion onto greenland . 
  they killed the dorset off in the process . 
  i fail to see why protecting businesses in sweden would have anything to do with allowing the us government to act freely within our borders . 
  the cia is not a corporation . 
  but i digress . 
  the economy is part of if , but it 's also a matter of global politics . 
  historically we needed to suck up to the usa to ensure our `` unofficial '' alliance , and even today the whole thing has a lot to do with nato . 
  yes . 
  the little ice age killed them off . 
  yeah , kind of . 
  our government has a bit of a history overlooking the actions of the usa within its territory , but on the other hand sometimes they do say no and complain diplomatically ( though our ruling political parties are pretty usa friendly , and if the yanks ask nicely first they can get away with a lot of bullshit as our press has uncovered from time to time ) . 
  i agree with that . 
  adult people should be able to call themselves whatever they want . 
  if that is fuckcunt mcshithead then so be it . 
  children should not have strange and obscene names forced upon them by their parents however . 
  iceland is also particularly conservative about their language . 
  this is a problem that would also exist in other languages with clear grammatic gender ( german or french , for example ) , but usually the authorities wo n't care as long you do n't name your kid something that would be harmful for them in the long run . 
  if this references greenland most of the population are actually native inuits . 
  granted , the norse actually predate the inuits in greenland , but the inuits have had a longer continuous habitation there and they form the vast majority of people . 
  of course . 
  still , naming restriction laws have a purpose and should not be completely disregarded as totalitarian . 
  this is not true . 
  several countries do n't have armed forces , iceland is hardly alone in this . 
  [ here 's a list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_without_armed_forces ), 
  iceland is usually considered part of europe , whereas greenland is somestimes considered europe and sometimes america ( though geographically speaking it is definitely a lot closer to america ) . 
  edit : iceland is however right between the north american plate and the eurasian plate , which is why it has such volcanic activity . 
  however , continents , and * especially * europe , are mainly a cultural phenomenon anyway . 
  yes , because it 's completely draconian that i am not allowed to name my child fuckcunt mcshithead . 
  which just makes the whole thing worse to me . 
  the kid in that story never had any say about whether he wanted to be drawn into his parents ' political battle , and had they won he would have had to live with that name . 
  the reason black slaves were favoured by colonial american slave owners over white slaves was purely a matter of economics for the most part : the black slaves survived the harsh climates and long days in the sun much better than the white ones did , which meant you did n't have to get new slaves as often . 
  it was n't like the europeans went to africa , saw the black people there and instantly went : `` aha , clearly these lower people would be the perfect slaves ! '', 
  the preference for black slaves developed over a period of time when experience in the new world colonies started showing that they were cheaper to keep . 
  that said , the europeans and their settles in the americas did think black people were n't worthy of the same rights as them , and it was a very racist time in general . 
  why the downvotes ? 
  he is right . 
  the united kingdom was n't formed until 1707 . 
  in 1918 the name academics used was still lapps . 
  people were pretty racist back then . 
  your grandparents could have worked for the political elite and thus have gotten a larger ration . 
  til : i 'm apparently average swedish male height . 
  it certainly feels like i 'd be a little bit taller than the average when i 'm out and about in public , but maybe there 's a bunch of tall people in a different part of the country making up for the statistics . 
  looking at the norse : elfdalian is not considered to be a language in its own rights by most authorities , though there are arguments for it being one . 
  it is most certainly not part of a distinct branch of norse though , being more of a west norse with elements from the east branch . 
  however , there are actually a few people around who still speak gutnish , though probably not the old version of it . 
  depending on the meat you actually want a certain amount of fat regardless of species . 
  take you example of sausage . 
  sausage made with lean meat and no added fat becomes dry . 
  i know , because i 've tried . 
  you * need * the fat or it wo n't be any good . 
  likewise , if you like me like smoked foods and have a home smoker you run pretty much all of the time then the meat you put in there for smoking has to have fat or you might as well just be drying the meat . 
  the fat is what picks up on the smoky flavours , you see . 
  fat in food is good . 
  you should eat it in moderation , obviously , but there 's no reason to fear it . 
  even pork is too lean these days . 
  yes , i 'm serious . 
  the pigs they make supermarket pork from are bred to be as lean as possible ( for a pig ) while still providing as much meat as possible . 
  this makes such pork very dry and very tasteless and boring when cooked . 
  with chicken this problem is even more rampant since the standard has become that chicken should be low-fat , low-taste dryness and thus almost all chickens are bred to be and taste that way , with only a few rare people keeping older , tastier breeds . 
  i would n't . 
  their country is n't called that . 
  just like i would n't call the uk england , despite the insistence of doing so by many of my fellows . 
  likewise , but because of a reverse situation , i 'd never refer to the usa simply as america . 
  that 's unfair to the rest of the continent , i think . 
  there was a swedish mystic/cult leader guy in the 19th century who placed atlantis as sundsvall . 
  i think that 's hilarious . 
  the vikings would reach the land bridge and take that instead . 
  then the norse hegemony over britain might never end . 
  it 's more accurate to say that god made holland and then left the dutch to clean up his mess as the place was clearly well below safety standards . 
  in ancient times the lowlands used to be not quite as low . 
  sometime in the early middle ages the area started experiencing severe and permanent flooding as the massive sand banks that used to hold the water away sunk below sea level . 
  so when the dutch a couple of centuries later started making artificial barriers and pumping the water away from some areas of their country they were in a sense taking back land that used to be available from the sea . 
  that 's why they call it recovered . 
  it 's a 17th century thing . 
  the taxidermist had never seen a lion and went by description . 
  i 'm not defending the monarchy . 
  i do n't really care one way or the other . 
  however , if you argument against the monarchy is that the king is some kind of tyrant or just that he is too stupid to be head of state i must protest . 
  the king does nothing of any political importance . 
  in fact , he is constitutionally forbidden from doing so . 
  he is n't and ca n't be a despot under the current system , and it does n't matter if he 's a moron because he does n't do anything , politically speaking . 
  now , if the argument is that from a democratic principle there should n't be a king in the first place i have no objections , because that 's a good argument . 
  furthermore as per our constitution the head of state has very few functions , meaning that it is in fact entirely irrelevant if the person holding the position does or does not have brains or an education . 
  it also means that if we abolish the monarchy we wo n't be directly electing our head of state anyway . 
  the position will be an appointed one , chosen by the parliament or even the prime minister . 
  look to the german model for something akin to what i 'm talking about . 
  likely in fact the first speaker of the parliament ( riksdagens f\u00f6rste talman ) , who is not directly elected as i 'm sure you know , is going to be our new head of state if the monarchy is abolished . 
  constitutionally speaking the first speaker already performs much of the functions of the head of state in the king 's stead ( however , i 'd like to reiterate , those functions are entirely symbolic in nature ) , so it 's a natural choice . 
  like you said , if tax money is going to be spent it should be spent on something worthwhile . 
  a national election of a symbolic position with no inherent power or de jure influence is a massive waste of money , and thus we wo n't be having any .

  it 's 3.5 % abv, 
  sweden as a whole : 22.4 / km ^ 2 uppsala county : 44.2 / km ^ 2 norrbotten county : 2.53 / km ^ 2 though i might add that norrbotten county is pretty large area wise . 
  at 98 000km ^ 2 it 's a bit larger than hungary . 
  you ca n't get beer from vending machines here . 
   is it true there are countries where you ca n't get alcohol 24/7 ? 
  yes .

  i was once asked to be photographed together with someone 's child while wearing a [ student boilersuit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/student_boilersuit ) . . 
  yes , it is not that uncommon for engineering students to have a linear algebra or something along those lines `` saved '' until year 4 or 5 , when you originally had the course in year 1 or 2 . 
  you must pass 75 % of your courses over a year to keep the student aid , except the first year when it 's 62.5 %, 
  infinite tries here , except for some courses ( i had one course whuch was limited to five tries , after that you had to redo the course ) . 
  some fields of study , such as medicine and law have courses you must pass in order to continue with your degree . 
  central heating from waste and biomass ( peat ) . 
  paying with cash is becoming increasingly difficult . 
  where i live i ca n't even pay for parking with cash . 
  lule\u00e5 is very nice , good communications as well . 
  boden is pretty weird , loads of military people and is generally pretty rough . 
  kiruna is literally in the middle of nowhere , but i think i 'd like it better than boden . 
  i guess blondes are more common here compared to other parts of the world , average length for women is 167.7 cm . 
  but there are many brunettes as well . 
  as for beautiful , well it depends on what you 're into , does n't it ? 
  grundskola : ( ages 6-15 ) averages 203 students per school , though some schools have up towards 600 students ( maybe even more ? ) . 
  gymnasieskola : ( ages 15-18/19 ) averages 262 students per school . 
  though i think the biggest schools have upwards to 1500 students . 
  what we call blueberries here is not the same as the blueberries in the us . 
  the european variant is also known as `` billberry '' . 
  `` frigolit '' is a thing here as well . 
  other examples include `` gladpack '' for plastic wrap and `` wettex '' for dishcloth . 
  not really , in 1972 all kinds of pornography became legal in sweden , including animal pornography , violence and child porn . 
  this was the case until 1980 , when spreading child porn became illegal . 
  it was n't until 1999 that possession of child pornography became illegal . 
  the 70s were weird times over here . . 
  child porn was legal in sweden in the 70s , i 'm not joking . . 
  lol, 
  the norm is 40h/week , though some places have 38h , or even 36h/week . 
  of course workplaces where you work in shifts are different . 
  the key thing here are the five weeks of paid vacation granted by law . 
  luckily ( ? 
  ) , that was caught on tape as svt was there , [ link ] ( https://youtu.be/mqakzce3ghq?t=90 ) it was in rinkeby , in 1992 . 
  some things never change . . 
  ines uusman was the politician . 
  she did n't really say `` internet is just a fad '' , that was a newspaper headline , but in a recent interview she agrees that it is n't really a misquote either . 
  * '' which translated would be something along the lines of : `` i do n't want to have a determined perception but i do n't think people in time actually want to spend as much time , as it actually takes , surfing the internet . 
  [ . . ] surfing the internet takes a lot of time , what is it good for ? 
  [ . . ] maybe it 's something that has grown now . 
  everyone is talking about the internet , but maybe it 's transient , and then the focus will be more specified . '', 
  * meaning : `` if you can travel to the moon and back , it would be reasonable to think that you could build this tunnel and other big tunnels in an environmentally sound way '' . 
  -1997 the tunnel she was talking about is the hallands\u00e5s-tunnel . 
  one of the biggest scandals in modern swedish history . 
  construction started in 1992 , and the issues began only 13 meters in ( the tunnel is actually two tunnels 8.7 km long ) when te tunnelling bore machine got stuck . 
  they changed the method to blasting after that , but got massive groundwater problems , and the sealant they used did n't work due to the high inflow of water . 
  that 's when they also learnt that the sealant was poisonous . 
  construction was halted in 1997 , and not restarted until 2005 with a new tunnelling bore machine . 
  the tunnels was finally inaugurated in december 2015 . 
  the total cost for the project is estimated to 10.5 billion sek , far above the 1 billion sek budget . . 
  far fewer than you probably think though . 
  yes , we do have statistics on this . 
   lifestyle philosophy  kalsarik\u00e4nnit lol, 
  yes i do , but both sj\u00e6lland and fyn are still islands . 
  indeed , according to a study i just read the travel time by train between copenhagen and hamburg will be reduced to 2 1/2 hours . 
  the travel time between copenhagen and stockholm by train today is just over 5 hours , but with high speed rail ( 320 km/h ) it could be reduced to something like 3 hours and 15 minuets ( stockholm-malm\u00f6 would take 2 1/2 hours ) . 
  however , as of know it seems like the line between stockholm and gothenburg will be built first . 
  even with the \u00d6resund bridge in place i do n't feel that connected . 
  to get to `` mainland europe '' from copenhagen you still need to either take a ferry , or cross both belts . 
  i find it easier ( and cheaper ) to just take a ferry from gothenburg or varberg to jutland and then drive south . 
  edit : or just take a ferry directly to `` the continent '' from sweden . 
  sorry , i posted before , or at the same time you corrected .

  sweden is tuition free for all eu/ees citizens . 
  it depends since atvs can be registered as three different types of vehicle depending on how it 's equipped . 
  if it 's registered as a motorcycle it can be driven on public roads as long as it can keep up with traffic , requires drivers license , the use of helmet , must pay road taxes , can at most have 20hp and must be inspected . 
  if it 's registered as a tractor it can be driven on public roads , but can at most go 40 or 50 km/h ( there are two types of tractors ) , you need at least a tractor drivers license for the slower or a car drivers license , the slower needs a `` slow vehicle triangle '' and the faster requires a helmet to be worn by the driver . 
  if it 's registered as a terrain vehicle it can not be driven on public roads , no limitations on horsepowers or speed , requires a terrain vehicle drivers license , does n't need to be inspected or pay road tax . 
  driver must have a helmet . 
  does n't the english speaking world ( including the us ) celebrate , and thus hand out the presents , on the 25th ? 
  in most municipalities you still need a permit to fire fireworks ( not that anyone care ) , new years eve and other public holidays are often exempt though . 
  in built up areas you always need a permit , again not that anyone seem to care . . 
  asylum seekers come from practically every country in the world , that does n't mean that they have reason for their claims though . 
  https://studyinsweden.se/programmes/ filter for master programmes , for eu citizens it 's tuition free ( though be prepared for high living costs and you probably wo n't fulfil the requirements for swedish student aid/loan . ), 
  you ca n't insure a bike in sweden that 's not registered in sweden , and to do that you also need a swedish personal identity number , which you ca n't get without a residence permit . 
  it would n't surprise me if the rules in the other european countries were somewhat similar . 
  i think you must get that insurance in your home country . 
  uhm , not to be disrespectful or anything , but you 're from brazil , and worried about travelling to europe ? 
  compared to belgium you are 3.5 times as likely to be killed in a car crash in brazil , and the homicide rate is 13.7 times as high . 
  even with those numbers i 'm not afraid of travelling to brazil , and you should n't be worried about travelling to europe . 
  and finally , hope you have a wonderful trip !, 
  no , not at all , europe is safe , but as always when visiting big cities , be on guard as shit happens in big cities . 
  i 'm mostly talking about pick pockets , accidents , or even getting mugged . 
  decisions can be both positive and negative , in the case of georgia none of the decisions were positive ( what i meant with `` none got residency ) . 
  yes , however the swedish migration board states that they have yet to notice any real increase from georgia and ukraine ( ukraine is number 11 , down 15 % ) . 
  the big increase from turkey is probably due to a certain someone . 
  454 asylum decisions were given to georgians , none got residency . 
  being invaded or not has nothing to do with how you salute . .

  i 'm to the left , but i have friends who are openly to the right . 
  no need to hide that . 
  we have a lot of very interesting conversations . 
  but there is a very big difference between `` to the right '' and `` extreme right '' , and if you belong in the second group then maybe there is more of an incentive to hide your position . 
  i would at least be a lot less inclined to discuss politics with you than i would be with the friends i have who are right wing moderates . 
  yeah , this annoys me to no end . 
  sounds a wee bit off . 
  it would probably be the other germans in the cauldron who told him so . 
  we have had immigrants come here for a long time , with them grouping together in poorer neighborhoods being a quite common problem regardless of where they originated from . 
  it 's just that no one , internationally , gave a damn until it began coming people from the middle east/central asia/north africa . 
  i do n't know what to say about finns in particular . 
  there are too many of them in sweden to generalize . 
  i grew up in a suburb on the outskirts of stockholm with a lot of them around me , and was fairly used to not understanding anything that was said because i did n't speak the language . 
  i remember having flashbacks to that time when i went to another suburb where people spoke somali around me , which is why i brought it up . 
  i would n't call where i grew up a ghetto , but i 'm pretty wary of using that term at all in a swedish context . 
  it invokes very different feelings in me than the areas i grew up in do . 
  we traditionally have that whole `` kids dress up and go around knocking on doors , asking for candy '' thing as part of our easter celebration instead , so that aspect of the halloween tradition has n't really caught on here ( as far as i 've seen ) . 
  the influence more or less stops with us eating a shit ton of candy while maybe watching a horror movie . 
  yes , it has grown really bigly all over the world under your watchful eye . 
  at first i quite liked the princess , but when they turned her into the stereotypical sex-crazy swedish blonde in the end whatever character development she 'd received previously just went out the window . 
  a shame . 
  i ca n't speak for my country , only myself . 
  just so that 's clear out of the gate . 
  i really think that how i view american exceptionalism depends a lot on how americans view it , either individually or in general . 
  if you prefer the american way of life , i have no problem with that . 
  i by and large prefer the swedish way of life , so in my eyes we 're on fairly equal footing there . 
  it 's only when ( or if ) you let this turn into some kind of innate and seemingly objective ranking above other countries that it becomes grating . 
  it 's not ; any perceived superiority is always subjective , and may definitely not be shared by everyone else . 
  i do n't see this mentality a lot with regular american citizens , but it 's something that crops up every now and again with your politicians , such as when john mccain was describing the us as the `` moral compass of the world '' or something to that effect when he was interviewed by seth meyers a few days ago . 
  stuff like that comes across , at best , as obnoxious and condescending . 
  at worst , it can be seen as a way to justify actions and policies that non-americans do n't necessarily agree with but that nonetheless can affect us significantly , by assuming that you are that guiding light and that the rest of the world looks up to you . 
  that 's * really bad * and easily creates bad blood . 
  again : it 's something i rarely see from regular citizens , but it 's not too uncommon among especially your right-wing politicians . 
  so to sum it up a bit , i do n't really care that individual americans see the us as exceptional as long as you realize that other people might not . 
  i think that a clear understanding of how you and the things you are doing are perceived in different parts of the world , would be a very good thing to balance things out . 
  i 'm not aware of a `` muslim echo chamber '' . 
  if people group together , it 's mostly people from the same country living in close proximity to each other . 
  if those countries are predominantly muslims then these groups will probably be predominantly muslim as well , but all muslims do n't group together with each other regardless of where they come from . 
  they do not form a single monolithic echo chamber , but a lot of smaller ones . 
  this happens with a lot of different immigrants , not just muslim ones and not just from new groups of nationalities . 
  i grew up in a neighborhood with a huge finnish population who mostly kept to themselves and spoke finnish , and finns are probably the oldest group of immigrants we have in sweden . 
  chances are that americans will fall into the same pattern ( especially since native english speakers tend to have a hard time learning swedish ) , and if so , what is really gained ? 
  i also do n't get how we could justify taking in americans instead of people from syria or iraq on some kind of humanitarian grounds . 
  while i really do sympathize with african-americans , their situation is hardly more pressing than people fleeing war and terror . 
  yeah , i do n't mind it . 
  i have always liked living just outside of stockholm . 
  close to where everything happens , but still not the inner city buzz that i ca n't stand . 
  well , the first kingsman movie dove headfirst right into annoying swedish stereotypes with the prime minister and the princess , so just imagine them to be secret agents and you have your movie . 
  i find it a little sad that so many questions about letting more americans into europe ( a reasonable discussion ) feel the need to veer in the direction of how we supposedly already take in too many people from muslim countries , and would n't it just feel * nicer * to have a lot of americans instead ? 
  it would not . 
  i have no interest in making it easier for people to come here , who , with a wink and a nod to anti-muslim sentiments , argue that they would make better immigrants than those we already have . 
  you want to come just like anyone else ? 
  fine . 
  but i 'm not going to give you any special privileges as long as that is how you make your point . 
  my parents still watch regular tv and pay for a bunch of channels ( unlike me ) , so when i visit them i tend to watch bbc for the comedy . 
  i really like a lot of stuff that 's on bbc , but sadly i have n't seen it being streamed ( legally ) anywhere . 
  tv shows like broadchurch and doctor who are , but not stuff like qi or would i lie to you ? . 
  i really like ours . 
  it 's all about the beauty of the nordic countries , rather than praising sweden as such , which i think is nice . 
  for all of our teasing one another , we 're still brothers and sisters , and our anthem really emphasizes that . 
  i am all for space exploration , even if i doubt that sweden will be the nation that really leads the charge to mars and beyond . 
  i was n't trying to be an ass , but you * are * an american responding to another american requesting responses specifically from americans , with your experience moving from one american state to another american state ... in askeurope . 
  it just felt pretty odd . 
  how does this relate to europe in any way ? 
  some of your countrymen [ beg to differ . 
  ] ( http://www.visitfinland.com/article/meet-santa-claus/ ), 
   perhaps scania , but that would only be to piss off the swedes . 
  i think you overestimate the rest of sweden 's emotional attachment to scania . 
  you would sell santa to someone else !? 
  we do n't really have any history that stretches back to antiquity , but i know of one theory that is both pretty interesting and about a time as far ago as you 're likely to get in swedish history . 
  if you are familiar with norse mythology , you know of the long hard winter ( fimbulwinter ) that is supposed to signal the arrival of ragnar\u00f6k - the end times . 
  fimbulwinter is supposed to be three years without any summer , just crushing cold . 
  it 's just bad . 
  and the theory as of late is that this prediction of the end times is in fact based on an actual , just as harsh and long-lasting winter back in the 6th century , where a volcanic eruption blotted out the sun for years on end . 
  such an event would have been utterly catastrophic for people of that time - or any time . 
  back in the 19th century sweden suffered a couple of bad harvests in a row and that led to mass-starvation ; i ca n't even imagine how a couple of years * without * any harvests at all would look like . 
  but it would probably feel like the end times were upon them , and it would make sense to pass that information down to your children and their children and so on . 
  i 've never really thought of sorting different countries ' histories like that and do n't really consider any one country to be more interesting than others , but if i had to choose i would probably say the uk 's history . 
  objectively speaking the british empire is probably not more interesting than that of most other big empires , but a mixture of me actually understanding english ( which just makes taking in the history a lot easier ) and several of the former british colonies being quite important and well-known today ( again helped by me understanding english and thus being able to follow what happens there ) makes it feel like there is a lot more there that affects today 's world than in most other countries ' histories . 
  hahaha , i 've never heard `` halfrican '' before . 
  love the term . 
  i 'm a half-finn , half-german swede . 
  i consider myself 100 % swedish and 50 % finnish and german . 
  card-carrying member of the 200 % club , baby !, 
  :d but i have a fairly complicated relationship with the german and finnish side of myself . 
  i was never taught either language , which is just an immense stumbling block . 
  i 've tried learning german in school and keeping it up since then , but it 's hard . 
  finnish i still do n't speak a word of . 
  the result of this is that the only real identity i have is the swedish one . 
  it 's a swedish identity seasoned with a bit of finnish and german flavor , but i would n't consider myself either german or finnish as such . 
  this makes some stuff annoyingly complicated , since i do n't have any swedish family . 
  i basically feel 100 % swedish , but without any historic connection to sweden going back in time . 
  that connection is instead mainly finnish and german , but i have some trouble connecting with that as well because of the language barrier . 
  so in the end i sort of live in the moment . 
  it usually works fine in the day to day , but every now and again you can feel as if you do n't really have a claim to any country 's history . 
  so to translate this to people in general : if someone does n't speak the language , i have a hard time seeing them as whatever nationality/heritage we 're talking about . 
  language is n't the only thing that is important , but it 's the gateway to a lot of the things that * are * important . 
  okay . 
  i 've never taken a train through europe and only ever flown a couple of times , so i ca n't really recommend one over the other . 
  i leave that decision for you to make on your own , or possibly with the help of others here who might have more experience .

i can deal with 50 % . 
  or you could buy ketchup, 
  beating the danes since forever, 
  god dammit sweden . 
  personally i blame it on the pope for leaving the vatican and visiting the heretics in sweden but that 's just me . 
  brexit just keeps on giving i do n't think i can handle this anymore, 
  estni can not into nordic, 
  i did n't know the word for them so i just thought small spikes was a good thing to compare them to, 
  well you guys can just stop pretending to not be swedes so we finally unite under the true king karl den 16, 
  basically you have small spikes on the tire so it can get a better grip . 
  because the ukranian song said fuck russia . 
  i think this will answer all your questions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfjhjnevone, 
  they made the judgment before he did the attack . 
  it will be interesting to see if that judgement still holds after his time in jail, 
  if you mean terrorists in general the recent year , i think so . 
  i have not seen any news about daesh saying that they did the act . 
  it will be interesting to say the least . 
  i think he will be deported after jail since he is a terrorist and that they have already reviewed his case and made the judgment that he did not need asylum . 
  he will probably get deported after his trip to jail and i ca n't see the uzbeki government taking kindly to a terrorist, 
  i would say tunisia, 
  no fuck you he came from venus you fucking prick . 
  sarcasm of course, 
  turkey was seen as the goal for middle eastern countries maybe 10 years ago . 
  who is le pen losing voters to ? 
  gud bevara drottningen is the swedish translation . 
  hope this helps, 
  their anthem is one of the best but the name could be a bit more creative . 
  to be fair we worship punctuality . 
  at least the people in my social circle does, 
  it would be pretty funny if they fall under the 5 % limit, 
  i listened to a history lecture once about ukraine and how historians in ukraine tries to find things in their history to make their connection stronger to the rest of europe and remove the connection to russia, 
  here in sweden i would say that red and black cars are the most popular . 
  24th march 1720 sweden got a new king that agreed to limit his own power . 
  this is one of steps to the swedish age of liberty . 
  a terrorist want to change government policys . 
  i meant lonely in that no language is closely related to greek, 
  one of the oldest cultures in the world with a very strange and lonely language, 
  sweden never had serfdoom . 
  his parents are , he is born in sweden, 
  why are pepole so tall in the balkans ? 
  what point us he trying to make with this statement . 
  islam is a bad religon because of it 's founder ? 
  what i 'm trying to say is even if this statement is true it 's meaningless because it 's not proving anything . 
  edit : to the pepole commenting . 
  what i meant was his statement proves nothing about todays muslims or pepole from the middle east . 
  yes mohammed had a what we considerd today a pedofilic realtionship but that does not mean that all muslims today likes that he had that kind of realtionship . 
  and what kind of hunting would that be . 
  hunting should be respectable and humane not some task that needs to be done . 
  speak for yourself, 
  knowing your country it 's probably 200 % at least that 's my experience when i visited denmark / s, 
  it 's so sad that luxemburg is not competing in eurovision . 
  i would love them if they came back . 
  basically their is a lot of rooms with different challenges in them . 
  if they complete a challenge before the time runs out they get a key . 
  this guy completed thus challenge with only one hit which is really impressive, 
  do n't know a lot only that they managed to exit yugoslavia relative unbloody, 
  i never heard of anyone being circumcised except for religious reasons . 
  so yes you are right it 's not much of a tradition edit : there is medical reasons for it to . 
  i forgot, 
  santa at both the top and the bottom http://i.imgur.com/ghkbueo.jpg, 
  hey we do n't say chex or are danish in \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland . 
  what this should tell you are that the creator are a filthy 08, 
  some of the illegal market in sweden is now using an app called swish that allows you to send money to someone via your phone . 
  one of my bank cards have it and is almost as good of an invention as swish . 
  i only wish that i can get that feature on my main bank card . 
  one of my bank cards have it and is almost as good of an invention as swish . 
  i only wish that i can get that feature on my main bank card . 
  do n't you dare touch the cafeteria or restaurant . 
  you would corrupt it with high prices and shitty meatballs, 
  you can have the sofa section but nothing more, 
  sweden has also updated their banknotes so the one you used is not valid anymore but please go ahead and take our worthless banknotes if you want . 
  that 's intressting that the type weapons varies that much . 
  in sweden almost everyone uses a husqvarna weapon of some sort . 
  the most popular weapon is probably a husqvarna 1900 with 6,5 x55 caliber . 
  i 'm talking about your average rifle that looks like this http://www.ruger.com/products/hawkeyestandard/images/top.jpg and yes all swedish hunters that owns a rifle needs to able to do this otherwise they would have failed their test on the moose range video of said moose range https://youtu.be/2kpt2vm6l1y?t=44s, 
  you are right but the reason that i did not include your argument in my comment is because of two reasons . 
  you need to learn how to do this in every swedish hunting exam and for me it did not take long time to learn this and the same can be said for the people i took my hunting exam with . 
  so with my experience that it does not take long time to learn and that i expect because of me being used to the swedish system , i simply did not think about beginners . 
  but as i stated earlier i agree with you that for a beginner a semi automatic rifle is a big advantage when you need to take a second shot . 
  i have soon spent 6 weeks in finland and the biggest cultural shock so far is how many products you can buy with salmiakki flavour . 
  i have seen everything from vodka to honey and i 'm sure that i have not even seen half of the salmiakki flavored products . 
  the only good years are when sweden win , no exception / s, 
  hahaha i want to see the face of the border guard when they inspected the van and found the cheese . 
  the main difference between a bolt action rifle and a semi automatic rifle is the rate of fire but during hunting that only matters when your first shot was not good enough . 
  if your shot was not good the semi automatic have an advantage since you can fire again without doing an added motion that could mess with your aim . 
  we are talking about maybe 1-2 seconds difference here and in most cases these seconds wo n't matter . 
  so to answer your question semi automatic rifles are not needed and they do not make hunting more or less humane but some people have a preference towards semi automatic rifles . 
  personally i do n't see any reason to make it any harder for pepole to acquire semi automatic rifles since they do n't contribute to any more crime than normal rifles and they do n't impact the humane factor of he hunt . 
  weird monarchy, 
  good . 
  i do n't agree it feels like yours are missing something but i ca n't put my finger on what it is . 
  cinnamon buns tastes different in finland compared to swedish ones that i 'm used to, 
   but the little i remember is positive . 
  and we all know the reason for that do n't we ? 
  i 'm surprised sweden is not on in top ten in coffee drinking . 
  we drink a lot if coffee, 
  how many cups of tea a day is that ? 
  i would guess around 4-5, 
  it is the biggest lake in the eu if i remember correctly . 
  if i remember correctly it 's that many somali pirates ends up in prison in seychelles .

  simply speaking `` disrespect '' just broadens the regulation far to much to be used as a sufficiently specific term , as its used in the swedish paragraph . 
  also you failed to mention in your op that the law requiers that you actively spread the `` hate speech '' for it to be a criminal offence . 
  as in you have to actually like write in a magazine or make a youtube video or speak before a mass of people for the regulation to be applicable . 
  simply saying something hateful by yourself is just not enough to be sentenced by this regulation . 
  in sweden even jews and muslims need to stun the animals before killing them . 
  well you ca n't prosecute an object and banning litterature is not a possibility in sweden . 
  also i think the bible would be in a bit of a pickle aswell seeing how it `` talks '' about homosexuals and other , etc. 
  the boiling frog is just an excuse to use the slippery slope fallacy . 
   do n't you have a `` sense of justice '' class ? 
  no we have n't . 
  i wish we did though and later on there is an optional class you can take which i probably will . 
   it 's not that you have to pay 1000 kr . 
  but the fact that you are `` guilty '' that will destroy the sense of justice . 
  yes principally a bad law is a bad law no matter the sanction it presents . 
  i 'm simply saying that a bad law that results in a fine is much less of an immedieate , and practical issue than a bad law that stricly resultst in prison time . 
  i 'm not saying either one is without issues . 
  yes its a competent translation . 
  the issue once again lies in that it does n't `` tell the whole story '' , as in the does n't fully show the extent aswell as limitations of the swedish text . 
  but i 'll give you that its the best translation i 've heard so far . 
  i 'm sorry but politics have nthing to do about applicattion of the law . 
  just because both sides decides it was a `` bad thing '' does n't make it a punishable offence in the eye of the courts . 
  honestly both those statements are far too mild to break the law . 
  unless they are made in some extreme form of circumstance . 
  i get what you 're trying to do , as in `` is either gender or religion more protected than the other ? '', 
  and theoretically they shoulnd ' t be . 
  theoretically the law should be applied equally in both cases . 
  now we 're stepping in to expert teritory and i 'm sure someone has wrote a book on that very subject . 
  this is just how i think it is , and i 'm * probably * right . 
  ofcourse it does . 
  are you really going to argue that prison * is n't * worse than a fine ? 
  sure , a law can still be ridiculous even if it only results in a fine , but it makes it much less of an immideate issue if the law does n't grant the government the possibility to seize , and effectively silence , individuals that breaks the law . 
  yes its an alright strict translations of the words . 
  the reason i 'm a bit cautious against it is that the translation implies a wider regulation than it does in swedish . 
  translating judiciary terms like this can easily lead to problematic results as the one op ran into . 
  but yeah , you more or less figured it out . 
   the mob forming outside someone 's house with knives and saying they 'll enter his house if the police does n't do something about him i 'm not exactly a fan of what they did but it was n't a crime however you look at it . 
  and he was n't sentenced either so the `` mob '' effectively influenced none . 
  i fail to see how this is mob justice . 
  is it mob justice when fotballfans gather outside an arena and borderline break the law in their fervor of respective team ? 
  no , simply gathering and acting disorderly is not a crime nor is it strongarming the judiciary system . 
  comeone then , i have google after the regulation silencing political speech . 
  i honestly ca n't find it . 
  and the only attempt at sources i 've gottetn is `` google it '' . 
  i did , i did n't find anything . 
  if you could please give me a actual case when this have happened i would be all for discussing it !, 
  i 've answered you twice allready . 
  please refer to those two answers . 
  edit : and in no way should i be viewed as an authority , i simply stated i was a student in an effort to provide context . 
  you said it much better than i did . 
   hets mot folkgrupp is incitement . 
  yes but that just the name of the offence , the actual `` hets mot folkgrupp '' bit ( the `` incitement '' bit ) is n't actually present in the requisites of the paragraph . 
  as in the requisits you have to fullfill to break said regulation . 
   missaktning is an added word to make the definition much broader , which is of course the point . 
  thats not true . 
  `` missaktning '' is one of the two alternative requisites required for commiting the crime . 
  the other alternative requisite is `` hotar '' ( threatening ) . 
    swedish law is written in swedish and interpreted by swedish judges . 
   shock ... who knew ? 
  i think this was about the difficulty to translate the meaning of a judiciary regulation into a foreign language . 
  i 'm not close to being an undergrad , got a couple of more years until that point . 
  i 'm especially not a expert of any kind . 
  none of what i say should be regarded as an expert opinion . 
   people have been taken to court because they 've written negatively about immigration - and immigrants behaviour . 
  this does n't indicate anything . 
  the real question is wheter someone has been sentenced for it . 
  ( hint : they have n't )  also , missaktning is absolutely a mild word . 
  disrespect is not a perfect translation but it is in within the ballrange . 
  it 's not at all `` inciting to hatred '' . 
  yes , in common language use the term could simply be translated to `` disrespecting '' . 
  when in the speher of the law stating that the implication of `` missaktning '' is the same as `` disrespecting '' is nothing short of disingenuous . 
  it implies the regulation has a different intent and effect than it actually does . 
   that 's snokus pushing his propaganda . 
  i mean , if you could class clearing up missconceptions about the law an agenda , then sure , i have an agenda . 
  edit : just saw this :  even if that is how he presents himself . 
  when have i presented myself as an expert ? 
  just said op was wrong and i stand by that . 
  does n't mean i 'm claiming to be an expert on the subject . 
  they are honestly superb . 
  the eu-court are very competent when it comes to human rights aswell . 
  haha well i dont know what you 're talking about . 
  i ca n't think of a single instance of when hate speech has been applied by the courts in a case of political speech . 
  you might be thinking of the tabloids in which cases yes , some media are very liberal in their labeling of hate speechers . 
  there is a difference between the media and the courts though and right now were discussing the application of the law by the courts so i do n't really see how that would be an argument for missuse of the law . 
   ( reserverade , do n't know if ` dissent ' in the correct translation . ) ? 
  its the correct translation  imagine the contrary , what would your definition of it being `` close '' be ? 
  that he was n't convicted but one of the `` n\u00e4mndem\u00e4n '' dissented ( reserverade , do n't know if ` dissent ' in the correct translation . ) ? 
  my definition of close would be if the supreme court couldnt decide on it . 
  there is plenty of cases where the first two instances have judged all out crazily and hd ( the supreme court ) have basically lectured them how wrong they were . 
  you also have to remeber that `` n\u00e4mndem\u00e4n '' is litteraly just common people , its not unusual that they come to a majority opinion that goes against the intent of the law . 
   but it 's your full-time occupation , i 'm a student but alright  yet i 'm still better at it than you . 
  whateber you wan na tell yourself  i seriously doubt your law school has taught you that , since it would be incorrect . 
  this must be that you 've either misunderstood or have n't gotten far enough in law school to learn about this , in which case you 're probably just assuming stuff , which is ironically what you 're accusing me of . 
  we were literally taught about this in the first term . 
  you can argue with me all you want , im still gon na side with what my teachers taught me less than 2 years ago . 
   but then we have `` uskonrauhan rikkominen '' , lit . 
  trans . 
  `` breaking the peace of faith '' , which is one of the bullshittiest bullshit crimes i 've ever heard of . 
  yeah we had this aswell , its popularily called a `` blasphemy law '' . 
  fortunately enough we abolished it a while ago . 
  a guy writes something hateful .

  i do n't have to say ` enough ' . 
  we do have to denounce the rhetoric erdogan uses , because it is toxic . 
  adopting it and calling turks aggressive subhumans is the ultimate stupidity . 
  it 's fairly easy to preach hate . 
  in russia , it took putin about five years to paint eu countries and the us as enemies again , after a 20 year long gradual improvement of relations . 
  now most russians believe in it . 
  they have been fooled , but their whole reality and society makes more sense if they believe that nato is preparing to invade . 
  when our neighbours fall , we will suffer consequences too . 
  when peaceful neighbours prosper , we prosper too . 
  meddling is dangerous , but so is isolationism . 
  saying `` fuck off '' to millions of people and not only their leaders , sends them into the hands of leaders and nations that do n't share our values , goals and interests . 
  i agree that it 's a problem that erdogan 's statements about europe have been left alone for the last decade . 
  he 's trying to drum up a distance between turks and westerners for his own profit, 
  he does n't have that power , but if it leads to clashes involving turks in europe , i 'm sure he 'll use it . 
  maybe . 
  erdogan is massive tool to work with , so we 'll see how far he goes . 
  crap !, 
  now i soiled my pants . 
  see you in court !, 
  he has n't exactly * done * much , however . 
  this is a perfect time to show `` concern about erdogan 's rhetoric '' . 
  this is n't a threat , because you have no credible way of backing it up . 
  it 's the same in the court of law , in most countries . 
  it 's not legally the same if a mafia member says `` watch your back '' as when a tired mother-of-three says it . 
  it 's the nature of our union and goals to play the long game . 
  do n't make haste when haste leads astray , basically . 
  they were n't dictated to news agencies , but shouted at rallies . 
  this statement seemed to have been aimed directly to europe . 
  europeans are a threat . 
  look how hostile they become now that i insult them and call them evil demi-humans : only i , erdogan , can save turkey . 
  these words were said to provoke hostility . 
  we should respond with reassuring our values and respond that we think his accusations are completely out of proportion , a disturbing attempt at provoking a foreign reaction useful to him in turkey . 
  this time the statement was largely ignored in turkey , and mostly a bait to get europeans hostile . 
  hostile people are easier to portray as enemies . 
  exactly , well written . 
  russian geopolitics leads to worse outcomes for all , on average , except a bunch of very powerful people in russia . 
  this is also the main reason russia opposes universal values , human rights , freedom of individual expression , etc - it makes ruthless power games more difficult . 
  meanwhile , the us foreign policy has huge flaws , but as long as we share the same universal values , our interests are more aligned than not . 
  point me to a troll factory with 400 full-time employees . 
  i mostly agree . 
  but it 's disingenuous to say that we 've blocked the borders , we still take in many more asylum seekers than denmark . 
  european leftists are often in the camp `` let 's pretend russia is a country like all others , except misunderstood '' . 
  it has n't been ignored by the mainstream press, 
   us and uk employ massive armies of online trolls show me one western troll factory of the type russia has in st petersburg . 
  kremlin is ruled by an elite who will take rational decision based on geopolitics and russian strategic advantage . 
  nothing else . 
  it 's not intentionally evil , it 's evil in that no means or methods are disregarded on moral grounds . 
  it 's a bit more complicated than that . 
  basically , sweden had to shut the door for paperless asylum seekers when it became clear that we were on our own with germany ( and austria , to some extent ) . 
   and in what light it 's reported to us is almost just as important . 
  ` womd in iraq ' is a good example . 
  you conveniently forget that this mass media bubble only existed in the us . 
  there were large protests , the largest since the vietnam war , against the invasion of iraq in several european countries . 
  the us response was `` freedom fries '' among other things . 
  9/11 happened and * american * media got played . 
  lol , in soviet your direct neighbour 's starving children were not a plain fact , but anti-communist propaganda . 
  in the west , lies are typically of the type `` oh , we conveniently hid the 10 % fee in small writing '' . 
  huh ? 
  are you trying to conflate pro-eu and pro-russia standpoints ? 
  those are far often than not opposed . 
  and le pen is the most russia-friendly candidate . 
   establishment since they rely so heavily on access journalism . 
  this is not all that true outside of the us . 
  there is media bias , yes , but it 's usually on the side of criticising the government . 
  yeah , but it 's also so low , because people of sub-saharan origin are the only significant outlier , and they are not a very large group, 
  poor harvests too !, 
  the height of the roman empire coincided with an excellent climate in its heartlands, 
  two seconds ago they were all muslims ?? 
  now i 'm confused . 
  anyway . 
  the differences are not that large , apart from immigrants from africa south of sahara . 
  those immigrants have about 3 children per woman at the moment . 
  regression towards the mean is also firmly established . 
  this has been studied and yes , foreign born have more children , but not that many more . 
  non-muslim immigrants also have slightly more children than natives , but that is probably selection bias . 
  if you move to another country for work or love , odds are you are slightly fitter than average . 
  consider south korean propaganda against north korea : a constant stream of truths , some trivial , some more politically loaded . 
  the hbo series taboo . 
  it 's pretty great , it features themes of colonies and foreign trade , but revolves around the us , the british crown , the east india company and private enterprise operating on both sides of the law . 
  but no swedish colonies are part of the story , even though it features a finnish-swedish director, 
  west germany 's most immediate next-door threat vanished , the warsaw pact was dissolved , and the german economy increased as east germany was included . 
  gotland was ( edit : semi - ) independent until the hansa took it . 
  at the beginning of the 17th century , sweden was a bit better at funnelling state resources into the war machine . 
  that , and the weakness of the small german states ( and hre ) , made sweden a major power in the 17th century . 
  we had nobility during this period , but it was n't as powerful and divisive as in other european empires . 
  the nobility ruled for much of the 18th century , however . 
  northern scandinavia was still a colonisation effort at the time . 
  sami lands occupied by norwegians , swedes , finns and to some extent russians . 
  on the other hand , the 30 years war was a culmination of many trends of european politics , while the escapades in poland had much less political meaning . 
  as i understand it , the motive was more to sustain a large swedish standing army , by plundering the polish heartland . 
  landsknechts are hell of an occupying force . 
  basically , the banners they fought under often could n't pay them in full , so they got permission to plunder and rape instead . 
  the plan was to russificate finland , but it did n't start until the late 19th century , and one problem was that finland in some ways was more free and modern than russia . 
  in the end , it only served to strengthen the call for independence . 
  yeah , all we got was taboo :|, 
  the rebel states are 90 % integrated with russia now, 
  include both , then . 
  exactly . 
  then the soviet threat disappeared, 
  there was some bad press on what went down in georgia , but there were no sanctions and a general `` meh '' from other major powers .

that 's incredibly skewed data - it only accounts for those born within sweden or outside of sweden . 
  / r/europe is not a unified entity . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the vast majority here have little idea what you 're talking about , and that a fair number that do , * do n't care * , since they 're europeans . 
  national socialists are third positionists , though . 
  there 's an enormous muslim minority in sweden , and arabic is about to overtake finnish as our second-largest minority language , despite the fact that finland and sweden are right next door to eachother and was the same country for ~ 800 years . 
  because over 20 % of our population is non-swedish . 
  * proceeds to label arterial bleeding as `` just a scratch '' . 
   yes because nearly everybody working retail is infact a swede that catches a lot of danes by surprise when they visit copenhagen yeah , sorry about that . 
  at the end of the day , though , you can always say ; * at least we 're not sweden . 
  it 's very common that countries in general have a disdain for the capital . 
  i know it 's the same in norway , and i can confirm that it 's the same in sweden . 
  i think there 's several reasons for that , but it basically boils down to centralization of power , cosmopolitan arrogance in the population in the capital , and urbanization . 
  honestly , having an urban capital is completely unnecessary in the 21st century . 
  decentralize the government and move the necessary infrastructure into some central ( to the country ) location out in nature . 
  urbanization is a plague . 
  the worst thing is that even i , a swede , can understand especially the danish disdain for copenhagen , because it 's not about copenhagen , but about the copenhageners . 
  they 've got the same basic attitude as stockholmers , adjusting for national character . 
  i 'm not a fan , but at least i can * speak * to them , as opposed to * you people * . 
  this . 
  this is the right attitude . 
  it 's the actual capital of greece ... did you mean * constantinople * ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ... reconquista ^ ^ ^ ^ soon, 
   anti-imperialist , and was much more different than nazi germany or mussolini 's italy , he has more in common with franco or salazar than with hitler . 
  i 'm not expert on metaxas or salazar , but i fail to see how those two things connect with eachother . 
  hitler was also strongly anti-imperialist . 
  mussolini , not so much . 
   1 a veterinarian some people should be beaten to death * extra * hard . 
  but if they do n't , they 're supporting the ever-more-reviled erdogan . 
  this is going to cause some form of syntax error , no doubt . 
  oooh , i ca n't wait to see how they 'll handle this , if at all . 
  ^ * grabs ^ chips *, 
  as a nationalist , trust me when i say that i personally * hate * how we 've become reliant on reactionary nonsense and lumped together with anti-vaxxers , anti-aborton hardliners and `` climate skeptics '' just to oppose eu and the liberal paradigm . 
  the fact that i have to admit to myself that * `` welp , guess i 'm supporting trump and the pis '' * drives me up the fucking wall . 
  i have literally nothing else to go on , other than the descriptions in / u/unclepedo 's post . 
  and in relation to that , yes , i 'm serious . 
  all the others sound like eu puppets or incredibly corrupt . 
  but again , i have literally nothing else to go on than a very small , brief summary by a likely biased source . 
  you should n't take it too seriously . 
   third positionism did n't even exist before ww2 . 
  yes it did . 
  of course it did . 
  the first half of the 20th century was almost * defined * by third positionist leanings , and all fascistoid ideologies expressly rejected both the left and the right . 
   dss/dveri - new-age right wingers trying to appear modern , but are fairly backwards and incompetent . 
  have some support among the unsatisfied youth , might get over the 5 % threshold because they have a somewhat new lineup and people are fed up with everything else . 
  anti-eu . 
  i 'm sad to say that even with you putting `` backwards '' and `` incompetent '' in there , they still sound better than all the others . 
  i 'm not sure what that makes me . 
  voting does n't matter , silly . 
  hofer 's biggest flaw is that he 's not literally hitler . 
  yeah , no . 
  as a swede that 's had extensive contacts with denmark for multiple reasons , i can say that while the public discourse in denmark is far more open than sweden or germany 's , their politicians are just as full of shit as any other . 
  again , not leftist . 
  not rightist either . 
  third positionist . 
  it is not that hard to grasp . 
  the fact that the political strategy changed was the application of realpolitik and propaganda , nothing else ; the ideals were always the same , and national-socialism * always * opposes both capitalism and marxism . 
  you need some serious redpilling . 
  third positionist . 
  how come that people still are so brainwashed they have no concept of what this is ? 
  this time , anschluss comes from the east . 
  they belonged to the austrian empire and later the austro-hungarian empire . 
  they did n't find themselves ruled by a non-german majority until the creation of czechoslovakia following the collapse in 1918 . 
   absolutely islam . 
  but by that definition , not fascism . 
  like i said , two different things . 
   which fascist movement was pro-west and did n't oppose the western systems ? 
  all of them . 
  they opposed parliamentary democracy , unregulated banking practices , marxist socialism , and so on - but to unequivocally label any of this * `` the west '' * is completely arbitrary , and done entirely so you can call \\ < insert whatever you do n't like politically \\  `` anti-west '' . 
  it 's no different than to label opposition to communism `` anti-eastern '' . 
  it 's silly . 
   adolf hitler = nazism  muhammad = islamism  these 2 persons have many common features being essential to their activities . 
  many people have many features in common essential to their activities ; there are no more `` common features '' between muhammad and adolf hitler than there is between adolf hitler and winston churchill , or adolf hitler and mahatma ghandi , or adolf hitler and josef stalin . 
  this is tinfoil-level reductio ad hitlerum . 
   corporativism is not necessarily a part of fascism . 
  it absolutely is . 
  the view of the nation as an organic entity , as an individual made up of the people within it , is integral and fundamental to all forms of fascist ideology , it 's ideas going as far back as kjell\u00e9n 's * the state as a living form * . 
  corporativism is * the * fascist solution in opposition to the despotic materialism of marxism and the false rule of incompetent democracy . 
  without it , or at the very least a derivative of it based on the same fundamental ideas , you can not even pretend that something is fascism . 
   i did n't say there is an ideological connection ( though there was a connection between nazis and islamists ) . 
  i 'm saying that the ideologies are alike . 
  the similarities are so pronounced that it 's basically fascism . 
  first of all , there was no `` connection between nazis and islamists '' . 
  the only `` connections '' that is brought up are the connections between the national socialists and various muslim groups ( grand mufti in jerusalem and ss divison handschar ) ; neither which were any more islamist than politically active christians . 
  furthermore , germany had allies * all over the world * and from nearly every creed and colour , including indians opposing british rule and black africans opposing colonialism . 
  the fact that they cooperated with arab nationalists that had been grievously betrayed by the british after being allied with them in ww1 should come as no surprise whatsoever . 
  secondly , * `` the similarities are so pronounced that it 's basically fascism '' * is complete hogwash , with nothing to back it up beyond * `` i think fascism is wrong . 
  i also think that x is wrong . 
  therefore , x is fascism '' * . 
  if you think that the ideologies are alike , you should have something to back that up beyond lumping things you think you do n't like together and arbitrarily labeling them . 
  stop using * `` fascist !, 
  '' * as a pejorative ; it is as silly as the leftists shouting * `` racist !, 
  '' * as anyone that questions islam , the right screaming * `` communist !, 
  '' * against national-socialist , or feminists shouting * `` misogony !, 
  '' * when someone questions the wage gap . 
  it 's childish , it 's objectively wrong , and it only serves to make people more ignorant and the state of politics needlessly polarized . 
   it 's not simply fascism , it is islamic fascism aka islamofascism . 
  it 's the fascist threat of the 21st century . 
  repeating it does not make it true . 
  islamism has nothing to do with any form of fascism whatsoever and i would go so far as to say that they are fundamentally incompatible on an ideological level . 
  islamism is not the fascist threat of the 21st century ; islamism is the muslim threat of the 21st century .

  i am at least going to wait until they send me the letter ... 
  do you have to pay for computers too ? 
  how much ? 
  shit . 
  i do n't have a tv but a computer . 
  now i will have to pay . 
  if it is about long term democracy - why ca n't we vote about a new constitutions . 
  frankly , what you are saying goes against the maastricht constitution . 
  do you think we should be ruled by how some people feel , or by the law ? 
  if you say by the law you should no that bailouts and permanent transfers are against it , yet you suggest it . 
  furthermore , how is it democratic to break the treaty , every day ? 
   as europe , we have two options : kick them out or take them on board and help them to get up to our level . 
  well , i am all for that as soon as we have a vote about it , and people get their say . 
  i might not want it , but perhaps we can have two eu 's then . 
  as it is now , we are going against the maastricht treaty . 
  do you think we should ignore it ? 
  furthermore , if yes , how should we rule the eu if not by the rule of law and by democratic vote . 
  until we vote about it , we follow the law . 
  do n't you think ? 
   too bad they did n't ask you how to do it properly . 
  hmm , it is not me , it just a myriad of economists . 
  read up about optimal currency unions/areas etc. 
   that would have hurt the euro just as bad . 
  no , it would not . 
  it would have been one fall , and a demonstration as well . 
  the german tax payers could have saved their banks , the french theirs . 
  now - do you know how much and for how many years one have to support the greeks ? 
  furthermore , it would have opened the eyes of many of just what a badly constructed currency the euro is . 
   the euro is a serious currency , not a `` drachme '' or `` lira '' . 
  it is extremely badly constructed currency , and it ought to be re-done , or just consists of a few , comparatively equal countries . 
  but , this is an option ? 
  when ddr entered a union with brd they had financial and political integration , they had another country making sure they had banks , schools , hospital , social services and they had * huge * investements . 
  in fact they still have investments made and have received transfers over a trillion to date . 
  greece has nothing of that , but is expected to become functioning anyway . 
  add to that a corrupt economy and society . 
  ddr is still lagging behind , more than 20 years after the reunification . 
  how long do you think it will take greece to be up and running ? 
  yes , i think it would have been better to quit , take the fall , and then rebuild . 
  oh , i thought she was born there , but now after a bit of googling i see that she was born in macedonia . 
  of albanian decent though :-) . 
  i have to give him this , he is far more entertaining than swedish politicians . 
   and then they have euro debts no , they would have been bankrupt . 
  one of the few good things with bankruptcy is that you just do n't have to pay ... ruins your credit of course , but at least you do not have debts . 
   there was no `` option to leave the euro '' . 
  the euro is not a game you can just randomly stop playing . 
  why not ? 
   do we need to check the definition of depression ? 
  those countries did n't have a long therm downturn . 
  they were always down . 
  sustained downturn in economics - i 'd say a lot of the african countries have had that . 
  and , for always being down , at least one of the reasons that they are down , is that they have been * kept * down , as colonies . 
  so , that makes it even worse for them . 
  for example , read `` king leopold 's ghost '' about the treatement of the kongolese . 
  it will make your stomach turn , it was genocide . 
  and , frankly , the fact is that those countries are in much more need of help than greece , and they have certainly done less to be in the position they are in . 
  and , to top that off , they have been harsher treated by the imf , than greece . 
  so , why should greece receive special treatment ( which they have , and you might know that the african countries have complained about it , link [ here ] ( http://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/swazi-king-complains-about-imf-1.1137778#.ucg9j9iddni ) for example , i have more ) , which they have ? 
  they have received better deals , and even an excuse - not bad actually . 
   did greece solve their long term issues that is not an answer to the question i asked . 
  you said they would have been better off without the bailout . 
  i asked , that since the greeks , according to polls , preferred to have stayed in the euro - * how would that have been accomplished without the bailout * . 
  please answer that . 
   but most of the issues are still here . 
  so , why have n't the greeks fixed them ? 
  it is not up to other countries to fix the greek corruption for example - only the greeks can fix that . 
  instead , ask the greeks why they still suck at paying taxes for example . 
  no one can fix this but the greeks . 
  and , as for firing civil servants - why did they have a ineffective public sector to begin with ? 
   no , i think that the loss of competitiviness is due to other decissions made by our governments to favour the local fat cats and their short term interests . 
  i am sorry , but while greece and spain might have a corrupt economy it is also the fault of the euro , there is no way around it , and it is economics 101 . 
  you see , no currency is perfect , what one in economics terms call optimal currency area , but they are `` good enough '' areas , like the usd or the gbp for example ( fun fact , a swedish minister once jokular said that northern sweden should have their own currency , since their demands are different ) . 
  there are lot of things that have to be in place for an * decent * currency area to function , but a few things are these : * similar , but not exakt economies , but on somewhat similar competitive level , like germany/finland/the netherlands * common bank system/financial integration * permanent transfer to poorer and less effective areas * political integration . 
  there is more , but these are a few of the most important.you can , if you want to look all of this up of course . 
  furthermore - a recent example is ddr/brd , where for example the economies were not competitive ( ddr was n't exactly exporting a lot on the free market ) but then the other systems kicket in - brd helped ddr so they had functioning schools , social systems , banks , enormous investments etc , until ddr could stand on it own two feet . 
  it actually does n't yet , over the years there has been more than a trillion euros in transfers , but it is getting there . 
  however , none of that is in place in the eurozone . 
  when the greek economy does n't work due to the euro ( + they had a combination of low interest rates that made them go crazy ) they do n't have the huge permanent transfers to keep them going , the banks were saved in a bad manner quite unwillingly and politically it is a disaster . 
  the greeks are in a sense doing what they can , trying to improve their internal competitiveness with lower wages , since that is one of the few means at their disposal ( it is hard to become competitive quick without lowering the currency rate ) . 
  however , the lack of investment and the fact that they have to pay for food etc in euros is of course taking its toll . 
  however , none of this have anything to do with the saves - it is frankly econmics 101 ( please , google optimal currency area , eurozone etc , and you will read about it ) . 
  also , since it has nothing to do with it , but the underlying factor is the construction of the euro and the greek economy , it ca n't be * fixed * by the saves . 
  the fixing needs to be deeper . 
  also , what i am saying is in no way controversial , economists knows this . 
   i am spaniard , and this is n't the first time that spain has over 20 % of unemployment . 
  we had that before the euro . 
  but , you did have your own currency then did n't you ? 
  and , what was your interest rate ? 
  rather different scenarion now , is n't it ? 
  how do you quickly increase your competitiveness without controlling the currency and interest ? 
   and is it more capable now ? 
  marginally perhaps , do n't know . 
  however , as i have explained , this has nothing to do with the bailout . 
  to increase the greek economy competitiveness there needs to be a ) huge investements for a long time a la ddr b ) a different euro ( and a whole new discussion ) c ) a change in the way the greeks society works . 
  however , the change needs to come from the euro and from the greeks - not from the troijka actually . 
   they are supposed to pay part of the loans . 
  they have already received one debt reduction , there will be more . 
  there is no way they can pay their debt . 
   i said capitalist depression , that was another thing . 
  ;-) true . 
  ok , so no jail for him just yet .

  well we 'd be more than happy with a pride festival on victory day . 
  nice way to promote acceptance and love imo . 
  would piss of the russians but who cares at this point . . 
  english *, 
  who can tell these days with all those dancing negroes on tanks and legions of nato !, 
  not us !, 
  apparently nemtsov defended the free speech . 
  kadyrov having somewhat opposite views disagreed . 
  had his bodyguard kill nemtsov . 
  that 's the theory at least . 
  280 % now . 
  they 're going to salvate the shit out of you . 
  construct wonder : fehrmarn tunnel +20 % oversea invasion movement speed . 
  but they sanctioned european cheese and other food stuff ? 
  yup . 
  my religion class was actually very interesting . 
  we got to learn about the 5 world religions , the myths that were ground for traditions and celebrations . 
  and some modern day problematisation of old school traditions in modern society . 
  for example the ramadan fast and problems with functioning in a work environment ( imagine to your surgeon or bus driver not eating the whole day ) or the caste system of hinduism . 
  would study again . 
  well i would n't claim myself as historically literate but i am of ukrainian birth . 
  what is now west ukraine has been a contested territoriy and swapped hands many times . 
  lviv changed hands as late as ~ 1945 ish . 
  so there were some national tentions between minorities on both sides . 
  not excusing banderas actions in any way . 
  i think he was a disgraceful person . 
  never heard of it . 
  eu should call out their citizens on being greedy cunts who buy the cheapest possible clothing that gets ruined once you wash it anyway . 
   but for its time it was even the `` modern '' technology of administration serfdom was dropped as a practice in the nordics like almost 1000 years before russia and was abolished at least 500 years before it was abolished in russia . 
  remember , the nordics were pretty much the backwater of europe back then ... `` modern '' . 
  i guess you think walking around like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/antoine-fran%c3%a7ois_callet_-_louis_xvi%2c_roi_de_france_et_de_navarre_%281754-1793%29%2c_rev%c3%aatu_du_grand_costume_royal_en_1779_-_google_art_project.jpg ) is modern too ? 
   and the last but not least , serfdom is n't slavery . 
  it is actually an european idea that was borrowed by catherine the great from her homeland germany . 
  so again , not russias fault , eventhough it totally is . 
  serfdom is n't slavery in what way exactly ... 
  i was n't the one making any claims which piece of land belongs where ? 
  you on the other hand were certain that a majority decides to whom who belongs . 
  interestingly enough , the majority of donbass region are * not * russians . 
  so donbass is ukraine according to your logic . 
  crimea , well , why not ask crimeans themselves , in internationally recognized elections not held under gunpoint ? 
  you know , like the one in scotland . 
  it was so funny watching the russian media supporting scottish independence , as if it would make crimean annexation any more legitimate ... 
  that is all very interesting an all , but why is all that relevant ( if it were relevant , or even historically correct , but lets pretend for a second that it is ) ? 
  your initial comment says  founded by russians , inhabited by russians , speaks russian , feel russian and is a historical part of russia , then it 's russia . 
  which is according to your later comment , is simply not true ? 
  because apparently there ** were ** people living there , having their own civilization before russia annexed it ? 
  and the same `` slavery '' argument which you are using to diminish the tatar civilization can be made with the glorious russian serfdom system . 
  if you were annexed , you were a surf . 
  crimea was annexed for the first time by russian empire in 1783 , serfdom was abolished much later . 
   tatars are a minority , they ca n't decide for the majority . 
  interesting line of thought . 
  never crossed my mind . 
  lets apply the same logic to donbass then , / u/9a4172 , shall we ? 
   [ according to the 2001 census , ethnic ukrainians form 58 % of the population of luhansk oblast and 56.9 % of donetsk oblast . 
  ethnic russians form the largest minority , accounting for 39 % and 38.2 % of the two oblasts respectively . 
  [ 36 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donbass#demographics_and_politics ), 
   founded by russians , inhabited by russians , speaks russian , feel russian and is a historical part of russia , then it 's russia let 's ask the tatar population now , shall we ? 
  i 'm sorry , not that into tennis , care to elaborate ? 
  good time to invest now !, 
  they 'll only get more pricey when everyone wants them !, 
  some of us are more equal than others even !, 
  i 'd say it 's more popular than smoking , yes . 
  none of the `` iconic '' swedish brands pay corp tax in sweden . . ikea , volvo etc. 
  extra funny considering volvo cars has a full on pr offensive where they 're pushing it that they 're from sweden . 
  if we had a 5 % corp tax there are still places with lower tax and where the companies would register . 
  do you think a major company 's board will think `` oooh we can increase our profit by 5 % but we 're not gon na bother '' ? 
  the only way we could compete with tax havens is by having zero corporate tax . 
  it 's a race to the bottom and i 'm not buying that . 
   why ca n't you just be happy these problems are being paid attention ? 
  because when mr. ek raises these questions he has an agenda . 
  also because he 's a hypocrite . 
  and you are welcome to kindly fuck off with the personal insults . 
  have a good day . 
   they did n't move it to luxembourg , i 'm pretty sure it was always there but why ? 
  is his mom from there ? 
  his dog ? 
  why not poland , or any other country ? 
  luxembourg is not an arbitrary choice if you think that . . 
  so when he 's bitching about lack of education in programming , i 'm sure he can convince his talent from spotify to hold seminars and workshops for free for kids . 
  you know , leading by example and all that . 
   hey are warning the government that the housing crisis and regressive tax system negatively affects it companies in europe wow , i need an it nerd to tell me about the housing market . 
  what 's next ? 
  a gardener telling me which car to buy ? 
  on a more serious note : yes we all knew that the housing market is fucked up . 
  but i am not sure he 's the person with the right competence to speak on these matters . 
  so why move it to luxembourg in the first place then ? 
  if they feel like they want more programming teaching in schools and universities they are free contribute . 
  i simply do n't understand the whining from mr. ek et . 
  he of all guys should value the swedish school system since he 's a drop-out himself . 
  in the states this would 've set him back a few hundred sek to start with . . before he could dream of funding any company . 
  that 's because of your housing market and cuz not enough it experts and also because taxes . . 
  you do n't pay taxes on loss . 
  so what 's the point in moving to luxembourg ? 
  sure they might not make a profit , but expanding ( and thus increasing market value of your shares ) is not to be neglected . . 
  the points made by the spotify team may be valid . 
  it is however a bit hard to take them seriously since spotify operates from taxhavens like luxembourg . 
  if a swedish company that actually pays tax here and contributes to the education etc via the tax bill would say the same , it 'd be much easier to take it seriously . 
  spotify is not the biggest it employer in sweden . 
  those few hundred people will easily find jobs on one of the world 's hottest it markets that is stockholm . 
  got any reading recommendations in english ?

  frankly - if the eu works , why have the dynamic not changed one bit ? 
   town centres actually look modern and friendly . 
  is that the role of the eu - to take finnish tax payers money for example to make irish towns look friendly ? 
  i am sorry if i offended you , but please tell me why the same countries are net contributors as before . 
  spain , greece and portugal hads been on the receiving end for 34 years in 2020 , it is neither healthy nor is it fair . 
  and , do n't you dare blame it on agriculture - those are the countries that have supported the ineffecient cap that we have.not to mention that a majority of the tax payers money has gone to that . 
   it 's a big sector here no , it is a big sector because you have supported it . 
  nor * is * it actually a bigger sector than let us say in sweden , but we are still net payers . 
   also , as an irish person i take great offence to your preconceived notions of what we have done with the funding we have gotten . 
  so , all the time when we did n't banned the dealing with the settlements , the israelis have just been trying to have peace talks , truly fight for an independent palestine etc , but * this * will be counterproductive ? 
  seriously , i wish the us/eu would get their head out of israels ass and put some real pressure on them . 
  we all know they do not want an independent palestine , but that does n't mean that the palestinians do n't deserve a country . 
  and , we all know the settlements are there for land grabbing too , israel . 
  so , spanish sewages paid for with swedish money ? 
  i 'd like to see more investements in renewable energy too , but that is not what a majority of the infrastructure is going too - it is going to other things . 
  and frankly , i wonder for how long . 
  if spain for example is going to get their roads built for them by the eu since 1986 ( and it is at least going to be until 2020 ) - for how long is the eu going to build spanish roads . 
  frankly - roads are out , and i think 34 years is more than enough . 
  i do n't mind being a net contributor with money , but frankly , i do n't see a lot for it , it does n't seem to work and i think the eu should reconsider how they spend the money on infrastructure . 
  it is not the role of the eu to spend money to stimulate the economy . 
  if you eurozone countries want to do that , it is fine . 
  but do n't try to get the eu to do it - we need a whole different treaty for that . 
  and voting , and ... . and , frankly , after seeing how the eurozone functions with the bank saves , idiotic bail outs , etc , i 'd rather run in a completely different direction . 
  and - if the eu investement works - why are the same countries still on the receiving end ? 
  first , define meaningful . 
  i think it means different things to different people . 
  i think we are connected in a meaningful way . 
   it was such a golden electoral promise : an airport for your small 60.000 thousand people city !, 
  most of them were built with borrowed money from the politician-controlled savings banks ( the infamous cajas ) . 
  anyways , they all collapsed , were bailed out and later forced to merge and turn into banks . 
  and kids , that 's why we needed to borrow eu money on june 2012 , because regional and local politician fucked up big time ... 
  but i 'm beating around the bush here . 
  so , the ez countries bailed out politicians banks for no collateral ? 
  brilliant plan for politicians , and bad for tax payers . 
  and people wonder i am against deeper financial integration in the eu . 
  this is what happens there - with germany in the forefront . 
  when we bailed out our banks they paid in shares , we sold them a made money on them . 
  that the ez did n't , says a lot , unfortunately . 
   i said it 's partly true , because most of that money was properly spent , in things like making roads safer , building necessary bridges , improving water depuration in rural areas of poorer regions , developping solar and eolic energy , etc. 
  and , as i started out , is not against that . 
  i just do n't think it seems to be to much , and has been going on for to long . 
  i think at least part of the money should be spent on r & d for example . 
  and , two question that comes to mind is - how long ? 
  if spain has been receiving money for that ( net receivers ) for 27 years , now , and are receiving up until 2020 , should some of those countries be net donors then ? 
  and , since that will not happen , then maybe we should look over our structure , obviously the choices we made are not working very well . 
  perhaps , countries should fix their own infrastructure , and eu be more r & d type ? 
  second question - if a country knows if will receive money for this and that , maybe they will not bother to build up a proper structure for themselves if they know it will be partly paid for . 
  can that have happened in spain ? 
  i understand that infrastructure needs spending . 
  however , it needs to be spent wisely , and with the future in mind - read non oil based , etc. 
  and , perhaps , for a brief period of time too . 
   none . 
  in fact , judging by the report , the fact that the state controls all the airports is considered bad under so what you are saying is that no money , at all from the eu has gone to airports and the infrastructure around the airports in spain . 
  fine , off to google , but i 'll be so happy if you are right . 
  doubt it very much though  why did you just tell me that spain 's regional infrastructure strategy of 16 billion euro per year is far larger than the uk , who just said it would spend 50bn pound for 2015/16 because my guess is that cameron is puttin on the big guns for 2015 who btw is election year ( at the latest ) in the uk . 
  but ok , might be less . 
  the uk however hasa far bigger population than spain and a net payer , not net receiver . 
  furthermore , this started as a comment on the idiocy of the eu budget , and if infrastructural investment worked , why are we still paying for them - in other countries that have been on the receiving end for 30 years ? 
  how many years is ok to pay in your mind ? 
  when are they going to stand on their own two feet ? 
  in general - if it works why are they still receiving . 
  now - answer some of my questions . 
  i have of course noticed that you have refused to answer mine . 
  a ) why are you constatnly comparing with the uk ? 
  b ) why are you comparing the eu to nations ? 
  do n't you know it is a huge difference in how they act , invest and how they should act ? 
  c ) you wrote this :  this is a trade enhancement and integration program , because expanding trade consistently helps economic growth . 
  the biggest recipients of this since the 80 's is southern europe . 
  which all need help right now . 
  so , apparently it is not working very well . 
  why do you want to continue something that is not working ? 
  have you heard of alternative investments cost ? 
  i think my money could have been spent far better elsewhere . 
  d ) if they have received infrastructural help since the 80 's , or earlier in greece case - why are they still receiving it ? 
  countries like kore has gone from rag to riches in that time . 
  same with regional help btw - for how many decades do you want to hand over money ? 
  i 'd like a number , please . 
  e ) you never answered the question about spanish regional corruption and if my money would n't have been spent elsewhere . 
  you said no lfree lunch . 
  well , if my money has been used incorrectly i want to know . 
  have they ? 
  yes , i can give to those in need - but for how many decades ? 
  it does n't seem to change , not at all . 
  perhaps we should do a large overhaul then , spend more on energy , r & d etc , and less on agriculture and infrastructure . 
  otherwise , spain , italy , greece and portugal should most definately not receive anything really after 2020 . 
  40 years must be enough , must n't it ? 
  i do n't get it - are you saying that none of the 48 airports mentioned ( or the roads to them ) are getting eu funding , or is it one of them that is n't . 
  and , for the second paper - what exactly is is you want me to see that ? 
  it is 79 pages long , and i do see that spain has a regional strategy for infrastructure ( 2005-2020 ) that is 240 billion euros - and i see some of it is coming from the eu . 
  far , far more than the uk btw . 
   that 's the kind of infrastructure investment i would support . 
  me to - and we are not , not at all . 
  also , a lot of that would also go under r & d , but that is someting i 'll gladly pay for . 
  not all research is good or leads somewhere , but we need it , and we need the structure afterwards to take care of the researchers and the results . 
   and spain is now dealing with the consequences of it 's past governmental system of favoritism as well as paying the maintenance fees . 
  so no free lunch there . 
  what ? 
  what have my money been going to ? 
  if they could have been used better elsewhere , there is most definately a free lunch for spain . 
  it seems like the eu has fucked up - majorly if the money has bveen going to that .

  only about five reactors are online today in japan . 
  one plant is going to be decommissioned because of the risks of an earthquake . 
  still , the one in 2011 about as bad as it could get , nearly the perfect storm for japanese nuclear power . 
  yet the tsunami itself killed tens of thousands , while a handful have been killed by radiation . 
  and i 'm not in the nuclear camp , i think it 's getting too expensive . 
  however , deaths at coal/gas/oil plants are regularly written off as tragic local accidents with no implications for those industries . 
  interesting !, 
  any estimates of the risks of anything happening this century ? 
  nothing terrifying , if they 're built according to regulations since 40 years or so . 
  even wtc in ny had regulations for aircraft collisions , but they did not account for the size and fuel of a 747 . 
  germans : quick , shutdown nuclear before fukushima repeats itself here !, 
  ( apart from the little difference of 0 % chance of tsunami and 0 % chance of a major earthquake ), 
  all ages . 
  stop talking out of your ass , it 's actually very similar in sweden . 
  the punishments around drug use ( as opposed to distribution ) are not that harsh, 
  `` 30 dagsb\u00f6ter f\u00f6r eget bruk '' : heavy fine if the drugs found on you are obviously for personal use . 
  prisons sentences are exclusively for distribution . 
  ... and i would n't call disinformation campaigns an example of soft power . 
  cia/kgb-type of activity is something else . 
  an example : russian soft power in ukraine was having an audience to broadcast anti-euromaidan propaganda to ( a majority of ukrainians watched russian channels regularly in 2013 ) . 
  the propaganda itself was n't soft power . 
  the lines get blurry , of course , but i see soft power more of a platform rather than the operations that exploits this platform . 
  they 're 90 % antagonistic . 
  have they succeeded somewhat in making citizens of foreign countries distrust their own governments and media ? 
  yes , somewhat . 
  have they succeeded in making people look up to russia ? 
  hardly . 
  soft power is per definition opposed to hostile activities . 
  soft power would be russia successfully promoting russia as a country to look up to . 
  the russian influence we 're seeing is hostile - fomenting dissent and distrust in other nations . 
  youth unemployment is low due to an abundance of unprotected hourly contracts . 
  japan is a lot more like germany in this regard, 
  there 's a lot more going on than that . 
  living standards for young people have dropped , since it 's getting harder and harder to find regular employment ( as opposed to temp work paying y950-1150 an hour ) . 
  then you have post-stimulus economies like japan , that are caught in 20 + years of economic rut . 
  i think economists ( including blyth ) at best can account for half of what 's going on . 
  oh , yeah , i remember when sweden did that , we lost a decade of development in stagflation . 
  this can be the outcome , yes . 
  but many countries have reconstructed their public spending and come out stronger from it . 
  if you increase public debt enough , you 're either a special economy that can print its own money ( the us , essentially ) , or your public debt is going into the hands of international finance . 
  g\u00f6ran persson , a swedish social democrat , has described the agony of going abroad and begging for loans to cover the holes in the state budget . 
  once you 're in debt , austerity is n't a choice anymore , it 's the only way to avoid default . 
  japan is in trouble , but they 're borrowing from their own citizens and companies , nearly all of it . 
  they 're not in the grasp of international lenders . 
  ( in japan , private debt ( household debt is 65 % of gdp ) and company debt is lower than in most other advanced economies ), 
   the real goal of austerity is fundamentally about enriching the corporate elite . 
  it really is n't . 
  ( national ) debt as a % of gdp ca n't go up forever , and when it reaches the 80-90 % mark national sovereignty is getting more and more limited . 
  reckless austerity should be avoided , but ironically , you have to limit deficit spending first to be able to increase it later , if your debt-to-gdp ratio is high already . 
  this does n't mean that all turks are imperialist , however . 
  it simply means that they have a national superiority complex , much like some other nations . 
  the closest example would be hong kong . 
  it 's not all that liberal , though . 
  benevolent dictatorships are anomalies . 
  some may even start out quite well , then descend into something quite different . 
  it 's the difference between formal declarations of war and surprise wars . 
  why are all poles fleeing poland ?? 
  niger is also quite small , with 19 million people . 
  in israel there 's a siege mentality because of the constant conflict with palestinians ( war will increase birth rates ) and demographically significant groups that engage in two things : reading religious texts and having children . 
   help is needed in terms of education and medical availability , not in terms of dumping low-tech industry products like shoes or clothing that they could manufacture themselves if this was n't a thing . 
  leap-frogging in terms of manufacturing has never worked that well . 
  china 's economy took off once they stopped over-investing in poorly managed heavy industry , and started investing in competitive sweat shops , while simultaneously aggressively improving their technical know-how . 
  rest of asia did similar journeys towards prosperity . 
  not really , he never won in a free election . 
   people who get paid in tips in the us do n't want the system to change , they prefer tips because they make more money with tips than they would without them it really depends . 
  the american system also fosters a spirit of charity , with hapless waiters and waitresses depending on big bucks from their benefactors . 
  some do cash in pretty nicely from this , but if you work at a place with few and stingy customers , you 're not going to see much money , taxed or tax-free . 
  common in sweden too . 
  10 % tipping after dinners is customary , but not mandatory . 
  in the end ( 1944 ) , about half the swedish airforce ( among artillery piece and many other things ) were lent to finland , so the arms & munitions part clearly had some official support . 
  as for what the diplomats said , i ca n't comment . 
  i agree it seems stupid . 
  sweden would have turned into yet another ww2 battlefield . 
  it 's unclear if it would made any difference in the end , possibly for finland . 
  nearly all minor nations tried to stay neutral in ww2 - not that many were able to . 
  hmm , you 're right . 
  the ones i 've seen in japan must have been inspired by this german design , then . 
  iirc , this type is the most common in the us , and quite common in japan too . 
  funny , the japanese hardly care about grades , all the care about is the entrance exams . 
   a religion that is thousands of years old wo n't really change that much in 80 years christianity lost its hold on politics in that amount of time . 
  descartes was swedish !, 
  einstein was a dirty globalist . 
  / s hard borders and nationalist policies are a great way of hampering scientific exchange and effect a brain drain . 
  the average in western europe is more like 180 cm . 
  germany is hardly at war . 
  trump/brexit backlash is real , though . 
  i ca n't find the data on passat 1.4 tsi real world consumption , but there 's a lot of data on the prius . 
  it averages 4.5 l / 100 km without any other energy input apart from petrol . 
  the passat will not beat that . 
  also , i doubt many 1.4 tsi are sold as company cars . 
  in sweden , the prius is simply too small . 
  the corporate best seller here , in recent years , is mitsubishi outlander phev . 
  a colleague of mine just bought one , and is commuting on electricity alone . 
  your argument would mean that the prius would suck at long distances . 
  but it does n't , it 's as efficient as the best diesel cars of the same size . 
  this is n't controversial . 
  i understand your point , but i do n't think it 's major enough to sink the whole concept . 
  for example , most of the energy when braking would go to the battery , while the em would only assist during acceleration . 
  this way , the ice would do most of the work , while not having to provide all the power when accelerating , keeping the ice closer to optimum efficiency . 
  for example : suzuki swift is now being launched with a hybrid engine as the main alternative , with a petrol engine as the `` sporty '' choice .

  too bad the majority of the people disagrees with you . 
  it 's definitely a sliding scale , with more legitimacy the more democratic ( i.e. 
  when the elections are closer representation of the people ) it is , if your political system is based on democracy of course . 
  but i had to disagree when you said the polish-lithuanian king was n't democratically elected , even though we both agree that this does n't mean that the election process for those kings were somehow equal to modern democracies . 
  the word `` democracy '' does n't mean a single thing , there are various interpretations of it . 
  yours is n't necessarily the universal one . 
  if the king is elected by the aristocracy that 's still a democratic process , it 's just not * as * democratic as if the whole people elected him . 
  the roman republic was a democracy , even though not every man had the right to vote , and some men had more votes than others . 
  before women had the right to vote we were still living in democracies here in europe -- less democratical , sure , but democracies nonetheless . 
  our democracies today still are n't a `` perfect '' representation of the people , we typically have age limits for instance , and many countries take away the right to vote for convicted criminals ( either for the duration of their prison sentence or even for the rest of their lives ) . 
  we are unlikely to ever end up with a `` perfect '' democracy . 
  your ignorance of this shows that you do n't fully grasp the concept of democracy , you seem to believe it only applies to the specific system you live in . 
  and so it 's obvious to us all that you have n't in fact read every piece of literature on the subject , because then you 'd know that yours is the opinion that 's contradicted in said literature . 
  yes , of course it 's not a perfect example . 
  for one thing , there 's the difference in time , descendants of european settlers have been living in sa for a lot longer . 
  you 're not wrong , they * are * , but it 's like saying that the white population of south africa should all go away . 
  it 's hard to argue that those that are born there should be held responsible for what the previous generations have done . 
  i mean . 
  it would be great if no russians had settled estonia , and it would be great if no white colonists had come to south africa , so we agree with the result -- it 's just hard to enforce . 
  i know , and sweden had a bicameral house until 1971 , i ( personally ) just do n't see a point in two chambers in a non-federation . 
  in a federation the second chamber has some justification because different regions might require representation in this way . 
  in a non-federation the second chamber is usually there to represent different social classes , as some feudal vestige ( the way they do it in the uk , and the way we did it in sweden while we had a bicameral house ) . 
  mmm , okay . 
  we do n't have states so we have a one-chamber parliament . 
   seriously , this is why the us requires a 2/3 super majority to change the constitution . 
  there 's a lot of devastating changes being enacted in europe on marginal majorities . 
  that 's a good rule . 
  and especially since that 's 2/3 of * parliament * ( or congress , as you 'd say ) , which is a lot different than 50 % or 2/3 of the general public 's vote in a referendum . 
  members of parliament are at least suppose to know something about politics , and they should be a little harder to dupe . 
  in sweden we have the rule that the constitution can only be changed if it 's voted through parliament twice , with a general election in between . 
  so if some insane change is somehow voted through we have the opportunity to get rid of those mps until the next round . 
  it really depends on what `` dissolving the parliament '' means . 
  does it just mean calling for a new election ahead of time ? 
  that 's fair , that 's possible in almost any democracy as you said ( the brits just did it ) . 
  but i take it to mean that erdogan keeps his seat and * only * parliament is dissolved , since he is the president and his seat is determined by a presidential election ( i.e. 
  not the same election in which parliament is chosen ) . 
  if you allow me to nitpick , a slippery slope is a logical fallacy but that does n't make it an incorrect argument . 
  it can still be used in a perfectly correct manner . 
  what that means , being a logical fallacy , is only that it ca n't be used as a rule to prove or generalise what * must * happen . 
  let 's say someone tries to make the following argument : `` we ca n't have lower prison sentences than we have today , because where will it end , are criminals to get away scot free ? '', 
  that argument does n't work because of the logical fallacy . 
  there 's nothing that says the shortening of prison sentences * must * continue , and so the result ca n't be assumed , it may very well be that there 's some point where the trend stops ( or is stopped ) . 
  if people agree on such a threshold that they 'll never cross beforehand they wo n't have to worry about the slippery slope , because then the trend will come to an end at an acceptable point . 
  * however * , and here 's the important part , one may raise very valid concerns as to where that threshold is going to be , who is going to set such a threshold ( and have the power to enforce it ) , or even if it 's too late for such a threshold . 
  those are issues that are very valid to talk about , and unless they are resolved there 's a real danger that the slippery slope actually ends up around the extreme end result !, 
  i think that 's what / u/exclamation11 wanted to say : a slippery slope is a slippery slope , and that is something to be watchful of . 
  it 's a trend in the wrong direction and that means it needs to be checked * at some * point , and that 's something worth discussing . 
  the situation has truly grown dire ... 
  i feel for you !, 
  really ? 
  i have always understood it as demagoguery simply being a fancier word for populism , that they are synonyms . 
  you 're correct that i did use populism as a synonym for demagoguery in my explanation just there , but i may be mistaken . 
  what would you say the difference is then ? 
  edit : from wikipedia 's page on demagogues , with my emphasis added . 
   ** demagogues appealed directly to the emotions of the poor and uninformed ** , pursuing power , telling ** lies to stir up hysteria , exploiting crises ** to intensify popular support for their calls to immediate action and increased authority , and accusing moderate opponents of weakness or disloyalty to the nation . 
  while many politicians in a democracy make occasional small sacrifices of truth , subtlety , or long-term concerns to maintain popular support , ** demagogues do these things relentlessly ** and without self-restraint . 
   what distinguishes a demagogue is * how * he or she gains or holds democratic power : by ** exciting the passions of the lower classes and less-educated people in a democracy ** toward rash or violent action , breaking established democratic institutions such as the rule of law . 
  james fenimore cooper in 1838 identified four fundamental characteristics of demagogues :  1 . 
  they fashion themselves as ** a man or woman of the common people ** , opposed to the elites . 
  their politics depends on a visceral connection with the people , which greatly exceeds ordinary political popularity . 
  they manipulate this connection , and the raging popularity it affords , for their own benefit and ambition . 
  they threaten or outright break established rules of conduct , institutions , and even the law . 
   the central feature of the practice of demagoguery is ** persuasion by means of passion , shutting down reasoned deliberation and consideration of alternatives . 
  demagogues `` pander to passion , prejudice , bigotry , and ignorance , rather than reason . 
  '' ** to me , this sounds like a good description of a populist , but perhaps it 's my view of what a populist is that is flawed ? 
  or perhaps all demagogues are automatically populists , but all populists are n't necessarily demogogues ? 
  in that case i 'd love to see an example of a non-demagogic populist , to see what they look like !, 
  i agree that creating hostiligy in that manner would make the populism * even worse * , but it 's not good to begin with either . 
  it 's bad by definition because populism means making sweet promises the voters without any intention to keep them . 
  empty words , generally designed to appeal to as many voters as possible wherever they stand politically ( * `` we need less crime !, 
  '' * ) , and no plan . 
  good thing that every single country in the western world is in that middle ground then . 
  it 's called social liberalism , and it 's in fact what everyone means when they say `` liberalism '' today , because * true * 100 % liberalism without a drop of socialism in it would be libertarianism instead . 
  social liberalism is the basis of both swedish and american politics , even though the former is signicantly to the left of the latter . 
   actually india was on it 's way to being a very progressive area , that 's got to be a firm no , there is no evidence that india was on its way to become `` very progressive '' before 1200 ad . 
  besides , what year are you even shooting for here ? 
  i 'm assuming around 1200 ad , the founding of the delhi sultanate , but muslim sultanates were created in northern india as early as 700 ad , and some parts of southern india was n't controlled by muslim rulers until 1500 ad . 
  when was this golden age of liberalism ? 
  you do n't have to answer , i already know you 're just talking out of your ass . 
   and then the muslim empire came and destroyed all that and consolidated the caste system in order to better control the population . 
  the caste system has existed since ancient times , and then changed under various rulers . 
  the mughal emperors did nothing to abolish it , and created new laws based on it , so that 's true , but it 's generally considered to have been truly solidified in the period when the british took over from the mughals . 
   * the caste system as it exists today is thought to be the result of developments during the collapse of the mughal era and the british colonial regime in india . 
  [ ... ] *  * the british raj furthered this development , making rigid caste organisation a central mechanism of administration . 
  between 1860 and 1920 , the british segregated indians by caste , granting administrative jobs and senior appointments only to the upper castes . 
  social unrest during the 1920s led to a change in this policy . 
  * you seem obsessed with assigning blame here , which i generally do n't , but you should know that the blame for the modern caste system is often laid on the british . 
  not that it matters for my argument , but it seems to interfere with your agenda to blame everything that has ever gone wrong in the world on islam . 
   and there are cultures even farther ( from the enlightenment ) than ( turkey 's for example , who 's half in europe ) like china 's and japan 's who i hope you would n't call backwards just because they 're different than yours . 
  i would definitely call many parts of china backwards , and i have done so several times so far . 
  as you 're not reading my comments before answering you confirm my suspicions that you 're not debating but just spewing propaganda . 
  china is notorious for their oppression of women , expecting them to behave traditionally and marry who their father chooses , and failure to comply damages the `` family honour . '', 
  sound familiar ? 
  it 's really only possible to escape this view in the large cities that are thankfully a bit more modern . 
  japan has of course had the same mentality historically ( as europe has had , historically ) but they have left it behind . 
  that 's not so strange , because the cultural distance between us and japan is in fact rather short . 
  as japan modernised as quickly as possible after ww2 they adopted european customs and ideals as well , japan 's culture changed immensely after ww2 . 
  again , geographical distance is not the same as cultural distance . 
  consider this my last comment , listening to your agenda/conspiracies bore me . 
  islam is to blame for a lot of problems , especially in the middle east , and i have agreed to that several times now .

  - have them make friends for life in some sort of physical activity . 
  educate them . 
  - maybe even have them act out war ? 
  much more realistic . 
  oh wait , *** hahahaha *** that 's conscription . 
  seriously , people on / r/europe needs to stop acting as if conscription for sweden is something bad . 
  yes . 
  for the matter a fact we can . 
  during the late cold war we could field 700 000 personel and we could afford it . 
  and we do n't need a carrier . 
  we have a big fucking island in the middle of the baltic sea . 
  which nato has already told is is of their concern that we do n't defend it as we used to do . 
  the reason america has so much money is because they take lones constantly . 
  which does n't have to be bad . 
  almost all countries do that . 
  sweden hardly ever takes those lones . 
  yet we can still afford an army of 700 000 if we prioritize our money . 
  imagine how much better and more we could afford if we took loans ? 
  let alone our military loans which we have only take a few time . 
  there 's actually some debate about that . 
  the majority wanted it to stay , there 's always a majority that wants it to stay ( even now as op 's article mentions ) . 
  but what i mean with people wanting it to end . 
  is that the number grew slightly bigger , and so to apease to those people , which many in the ruling parties though was a trend growing , they voted to end it . 
  which is what i think happened . 
  but i may be very wrong . 
  yup . 
  we 're even working tighter these days and our armies are trying to get closer to each other . 
   ww1 and ww2 pretty much destroyed any romantic notion of warfare . 
  explain to me why sweden had one of the worlds best economies during the cold war , and still could field 700 000 of some of the worlds most technologically advanced and trained fighting force . 
   and a single bomber can take out your entire base . 
  i do n't think they had bombers and stuff like gvozdika or 2s7 pion 200 + mm batteries capable of ending 200 + persons per shell 110 years ago . 
  when was the last time sweden was in a real war ? 
  yeah , and a single rbs system can take out that bombed . 
  a field launch radar can detect were those field batteries are as soon as they fire . 
  and by the way . 
  do n't ever ask a foreign service veteran in sweden that question in such a tone . 
  that is fucking insulting and wrong . 
  and you know that . 
   french here , we said the same before wwii . 
  how did that turned out ? 
  yeah , who could have guessed an army fielding wwi material against a `` modern '' combat force would have gotten plowed . 
  especially when their leaders though building a wall was a great idea . 
   having stocks and having stock deployed to the frontline in battlefield conditions while under fire are 2 very , very different things . 
  yeah , i do n't think you understand . 
  sweden is not france . 
  we 're not as bad as you were during wwii . 
  and we 're not talking about wwii . 
  we 're talking about the cold war and and present time . 
   then assume one of your big neighbors is going to go full turkey and decide to backstab you in the mean time just because they can . 
  ah yes . 
  norway , finland and denmark all are eagerly waiting for the right moment when they can finally backstab sweden !! 1 !, 
  seriously . 
  you 're sounding like a kid making up a scenario for a plastic soldier war play session . 
   yeah right please tell me how to fight the russians / s why do n't you go free crimea champion oh do tell me about how great russia is in ukraine and how their main fighting force has been loosing ground ever since the beginning of that conflict . 
  ukraine was n't prepared . 
  yet they managed to do what they have done . 
  imagine if sweden re implemented conscription ( as they will in the coming few years ) and got ready for what can be coming . 
  like they were ready during the late cold war . 
  and then with the preparation of our alliance with finland to get completed . 
  do you seriously think russia or any one else for that matter can without major casualty and cost score even one third of our country ? 
  we just had three neighbors who got invaded during the second war and had loads of volunteers for just about every damn side in wwii . 
  it 's painfully obvious you know nothing about swedish military history nor anything about war for that matter . 
   ww1 and ww2 pretty much destroyed any romantic notion of warfare . 
  do you think this is about having a force for showing ? 
  are you dumb ? 
  you 're a fucking coward if you think this has anything to do with romanticized war . 
  this is about being ready for getting invaded . 
  and if you think that is `` foolish '' and `` romanticizing war '' . 
  then what do you suggest ? 
  getting drilled in your ass by a foreign power . 
  getting robbed of the rights you are used to . 
  forced to labour . 
  risking execution and suffering . 
  all that without even trying to defend your family and your fellow country men . 
  let alone yourself . 
  you 're lazy , ignorant and coward fuck if you think not doing anything and just standing by while your country gets taken by some one else is a good idea . 
  that 's not my experience . 
   war is all except cheap . 
  but of course , as russia figured out , why bother working on the economy when you can just have stronk / s totally not hyperbolic . 
  and activley trying to miss my point . 
  you argue like a twelve year old . 
  and a single bomber can take out your entire base . 
  i do n't think they had bombers and stuff like gvozdika or 2s7 pion 200 + mm batteries capable of ending 200 + persons per shell 110 years ago . 
  when was the last time sweden was in a real war ? 
  we 've been in conflicts ever since the early cold war . 
   french here , we said the same before wwii . 
  how did that turned out ? 
  having stocks and having stock deployed to the frontline in battlefield conditions while under fire are 2 very , very different things . 
  especially on something as large as a frontline let alone multiple ones . 
  then assume one of your big neighbors is going to go full turkey and decide to backstab you in the mean time just because they can . 
  ah , yeah i do n't trust your judgement . 
  you built a fucking wall as defense . 
   yeah right please tell me how to fight the russians / s why do n't you go free crimea champion why are you so incompetent ? 
  the ukrainian `` rebels '' has been losing major ground ever since the conflict started . 
  seriously , you know nothing about war and that is so pathetically obvious . 
  just stop it . 
  you have no idea what so ever about what you 're talking about . 
  you have no idea how war is performed . 
  you 're actively trying to miss my points . 
  you 're busted .

  personal responsibility the american way . 
  i need pictures . 
  i 've always wondered what an elf lobby looks like . 
  sigh . 
  it good that you come into this thread and prove without a shadow of a doubt how self centred and ignorant americans are . 
  are you going to sue me now ? 
  i am waiting for you know to provide the pros that the anti corruption laws work and that the corruption lessens when you are in the eu . 
  i want the proof . 
  but to show you i have to explain that we even have a different system . 
  you do not even seem able to grasp that fact . 
  how dense are you . 
  if you actually * knew * our system in the nordic systems , you would know it is built to discourage suing the way you do . 
  so what you are asking is essentially `` prove to me that you do not have the us system '' . 
  and if you do n't understand how dense and frankly insulting that question is , you are really an lost . 
  i am on r/europe . 
  i do n't have to prove anything . 
  to an american who thinks everyone else should prove to him that they do not have the us system . 
  it is so extremely us - centric of you , and pathetic . 
  educate yourself about the world . 
  really ? 
  i do not doubt you , but it just sounds so ... odd . 
  i mean , it is not like they do not have trains , nor do they all have some sort of death wish . 
  good . 
  and it is relevant where you are from . 
  we have to start with basic knowledge . 
  at least of the sort that you can be expected to know at r/europe . 
  are you aware and know the european systems ? 
  that can be expected , to know one or two systems in europe really well and have basic knowledge of other . 
  and , you see that it is * basic/general * knowledge that the us system is litigious and they sue more . 
  that is general knowledge that i do not have to prove . 
  the fact that you do not know that proves that you are american . 
  i think it is an american thing to sue people for fantasy sums just because they are stupid enough to fall off a train . 
  also , it must be american not to be aware of other judicial systems like sweden 's and therefore claim that it is just as common that swedes sue as americans . 
  it is extremely stupid and idiotic of you to claim that . 
  where were you from again ? 
  the case about the burglar is a myth i believe . 
  i asked my brother ( lawyer ) about it and he said it never happened . 
  it was a made up case of what could happen in theory and has been around since the 70 's . 
  besides i do not think most of them win . 
  you do know that if you sue someone and loose , you pay for their costs as well . 
  that is one of the reasons it is rarely done . 
  of course i can blame the woman . 
  she is trying to get fantasy sums for being an idiot . 
  and , it is not austria 's fault that the us have an idiotic system . 
  why should they pay for the fact that the us do not provide universal health care ? 
  perhaps she should try to get the us to change its system instead . 
  i do n't have to prove a bloody thing . 
  it is very silly of you to believe that the whole world is just as litigious as the us . 
  besides , i could but i am on my phone and going christmas shopping so no . 
  also , here it is known as common knowledge , that there are different court systems . 
  we do not have the prove that . 
  it is like asking me to prove that our stockholm is in sweden . 
  did you believe everything is like the us ? 
  did you honestly think people sue each other just as much in switzerland as in the us ? 
  many of us do not have the jury system for example . 
  do you need a source for that ? 
  why do n't you google a tad . 
  i do not have to research the fact that everything you get awarded in sweden is based on `` basbelopp '' a sum set in the highest court . 
  so , standard for a rape victim might be twenty basbelopp . 
  the courts rarely go outside of that but if the rape was really bad - perhaps 30 . 
  so , it is impossible for us to get the fantasy sums that the us people get . 
  and , if you loose you have to pay for the person you sue btw . 
  also , since we have a social security and health system the sum in court do not have to cover that - we pay for with our taxes . 
  i mean one of the reason the us have the most expensive health system in the world ( not the best mind you ) is that doctors have to have huge insurances . 
  just one of the gazillion things that makes the us health system more expensive . 
  that is me !, 
  i have my own coat of arms . 
  thank you for showing me . 
  no , i am not asking you to prove for all 28 countries . 
  i think sweden/finland can be rather hard , since we basically swap places around top five/top ten , and have for ages , but there should be huge differences from the eastern european countries that has been for a whole , like poland , hungary and the baltics . 
  and , of course , southern europe . 
  there are a lot of data of corruption and its development so it should be plenty that proves how the corruption has gone down in greece spain and portugal . 
  not to mention southern italy , they have really harsh corruption laws in the whole world . 
  and have been so long in the eu that they must be innocent as newborn babies by now . 
  obviously no risk at all that italy is corrupt . 
  i mean , they have the laws that the eu wants ... . . i mean , if laws is all you need as you say eu want , then italy is one if the least corrupt countries in the world . 
  certainly a lot better than scandinavia . 
  but we both know that is not the case . 
  if the laws was all that we need ( and is all the eu demands - ) what is wrong with italy . 
  that means that the eu is n't even demanding the right thing . 
  because again - italy gas really tough anti corruption laws . 
  above all - this is of course something the eu should be able not just to prove , but easily provide of course . 
  i mean , of the anti corruption measurements works one should see it . 
  and concerned citizens should really have thus proven to them . 
  so , please provide me with the fact that the eu lessens the corruption in a country . 
  i 'd like to see evidence from eastern and southern europe . 
  10 countries will do . 
  oh , and can you also provide me with the proof that harsher laws even work ( since you claim this is what the eu is using as working against corruption ) . 
  italy seem to be a prof that it does n't you see , so i am questioning if it works at all . 
  is that clear now ? 
  yes , you can trace corruption indexes back to the 90 's . 
  just correlate them with time in the eu - they should go down . 
  should n't they ? 
  or are you saying that countries in the eu stay just as corrupt as ever and drag the rest of the eu with them . 
  you ca n't have it both ways you know . 
  either the eu 's anti corruption measurements work and the corruption goes down , or it does n't . 
  that means that when you add corrupt countries you add the corruption for all the future for us to pay for them . 
  so , you ca n't have it both ways . 
  either eu works - prove it . 
  or it does n't .

  * i want to have a big city like london or berlin in scandinavia . 
  i do not think it 's as extreme as you portray it , but still there 's some sort of similar themes in swedish media . 
  here 's an article from one of our largest newspapers : [ `` here is where the youth drink the most in europe - even at the school parties they sell beer '' ] ( http://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/har-dricker-unga-mest-i-europa-aven-pa-skolfesten-saljs-det-ol/ ) , where they compare the drinking culture of sweden and denmark and talk about how students are allowed to drink beer at high school parties in denmark when they 're 16 . 
  in sweden you have to be 18 to drink at bars and 20 to purchase alcohol in stores . 
  no , sk\u00e4msskudde is more about watching something cringeworthy , an expressen you then say . 
  it can also be used in a sentence , like : `` where is my sk\u00e4msskudde ? '', 
  when you see something embarrassing . 
  something that 's cringeworthy is called `` pinsamt '' most often . 
  i 've heard americans are surprised there are men working at nursery schools as well . 
  go equality i say !, 
  i must add the word ** sk\u00e4msskudde ** . 
  from sk\u00e4mmas ( `` to be embarrassed '' ) and kudde ( `` pillow '' ) . 
  it refers to the idea of seeing something so embarrassing that one gets the urge to hide one 's face in a pillow or couch cushion , for example when watching a television program from a couch . 
  do you have words that you can put a gender on , like actor and actress ? 
  or is everything gender neutral ? 
  `` awkward '' does not really exists . 
  i mean we have embarrassing ( pinsamt ) , but it 's often too strong to use . 
  so to describe a feeling as awkward is hard in swedish . 
  most people would mistake it for a peace sign , but i know that i learned in english class that it was rude in britain . 
  i found the romanian photo albums fun to see so thought i 'd make my own . 
  i searched after some fun pictures of people in sweden . 
  tried to make it `` representative '' ( except i chose more pictures of attractive people ) , but it 's almost impossible to cover one country in an album . 
  hope someone found it interesting at least . 
  of course i read way to much into it , but i do still not like the title , it was just criticism . 
  calling the title `` street photos in romania '' would have been better . 
  compete by lowering our salaries ? 
  with a unionised work force we can create a more equal society , which leads to a better society . 
  if you look at statistics on crime rates , prison population , health , trust between people , social mobility you can see that they are all linked to income equality . 
  by lowering salaries ( thus increasing the income differences ) the problems will only increase . 
  a healthier society is better , than having a few companies making more profits . 
  more like , satire from sweden but okay, 
  such sadness, 
  i do n't know why i did this , i really need to sleep , but [ here is a picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/g0ocdsy.png ) !, 
  like comic sans, 
  i think the article was mostly talking about `` digital extinction '' . 
  so i do n't think it 's probable to think that the whole language will be extinct , unless someone forces people to speak english . 
  i think it 's icelandic crowns so more like 15 eur . 
  i 've never met a backpacker with a canadian flag , but i would n't feel anything special about it . 
  i do n't think anyone really see that much of a difference between an american and a canadian . 
  i 'm just a bit allergic to the whole thing . 
  probably because i grew up with a mom that counts and records everything she eats and a dad who runs marathons . 
  of course , but it can get ridiculous . 
  i feel that when you start to weigh and count everything you eat , you are at the risk of developing an unhealthy view of food and your body . 
  these statistics just show that the regular life is good in scandinavia , probably because of the social democracy policies that have made life opportunities more equal here . 
  i feel like there is an unhealthy amount of `` fitness pressure '' here in stockholm . 
  it 's almost like everyone is on a special diet where they try to maximize their protein intake and to get as much muscles or whatever . 
  some do not drink alcohol , as it 'll mess up their work out schedule . 
  almost all stores have milk with extra added protein ( this is something recent here ) and quark is also starting to become very popular because of its protein content . 
  yet both switzerland and brazil choose saab over the other competitors . 
   if `` fifth-generation '' means more than `` the ultimate driving machine , '' a sixth generation will emerge . 
  the concept behind the `` fifth generation '' of fighters is almost 30 years old . 
   [ ... ]  we can say little for certain about the nature of future conflict , except that it is likely to be led by , and revolve around , intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( isr ) . 
   [ ... ]  the reason that the jas 39e may earn `` sixth generation '' tag is that it has been designed with these issues in mind . 
  software comes first . 
  there was a series that asked these questions before . 
  [ here 's the thread about andorra . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1huqup/series_what_do_you_know_about_andorra/ ), 
  there are almost no gas heating in sweden , it has been phased out . 
  there have been lot of incentives to move to electrical heating . 
  in the comments section of swedish news sites there will `` always '' be someone : * relating the issue to immigration . 
  * saying sweden has a housing bubble . 
  * warning about how sweden is about to become a shit country . 
  soon there will be no welfare , or how the industry is in decay or how sweden is becoming dangerous . 
  yada , yada ... 
  so yes , there always a constant fear of losing of what you have . 
  i think that we do not use indirect messages as much as british , but at the same time we 're careful of giving criticism . 
  it 's important to keep the status quo and not create any conflicts so ... 
  [ only about 18 % of the swedish population supports membership in nato while 47 % is against it . 
  sweden has a `` cultural identity '' of being neutral and no one wants to change that . 
  let 's annex it and hold a referendum and ask if they want to join sweden . 
  have you heard of pensions ? 
  sweden wo n't join nato anyway , it would be political suicide to join here . 
  all of this is just speculation . 
  they always do it wrong , when trying surstr\u00f6mming . 
  you open it under water , outside , then it will not stink so much .

  toivo annus the former head of engineering at skype answered the question about skypes `` nationality '' in a [ quora thread ] ( https://www.quora.com/estonia/why-do-estonians-claim-estonians-made-skype-when-the-founders-were-swedish-and-danish ) . 
  i think it sums up the question quite well . 
   its only natural to have more emphasis on local achievements and while the similar claims are made elsewhere you perceive it amplified in estonia as we do not have many similar success stories to dilute the chatter about skype . 
   was it created here or there ? 
  no , we did not pay attention to that . 
  we had team of many nationals who worked well together , over changing locations . 
  even in estonia the setup was far from sitting in the same office . 
  it was multinational effort to create a new communication platform and we succeeded well with that . 
  well it 's free and open source so there was never an exit . 
  but linus did make some money of it with redhat , i think . 
  it 's ridiculous to put national labels on companies anyways since they 're usually multinational . 
  what the estonians did was to develop the platform and i 'm sure they were not just `` robots '' who did not have any say in the process . 
  it 's like people who think that steve jobs is a genius , when creating ipad or whatever , when it is really was hundreds of people who worked together . 
  it was not just `` cheap labor '' .

  i 've seen it a few times and i have defended russia . 
  what i meant by the votes do n't matter is that they do n't matter for the truth , you can upvote a lie a thousend times , it does n't become anymore true . 
  i agree that the commonly held views on reddit may have an effect on the image of russia in the western world . 
  why would i be apologetic ? 
  i 'm not responsible for the weapons trade , if you 're interested i am definately against trading weapons with dictatorships and countries in war . 
  i actually agree that russia gets a massive amount of undeserved criticism and even hate on reddit , just remember that how reddit votes does n't determine what is true , that 's completely irrelevant . 
  this le s [ weed ] en bullshit is getting old though , yes a part of reddit has an insular and irrational view of sweden as some sort of utopia , but they 're idiots . 
  it 's all a bit old now though , today it has shifted a bit , nowadays in every thread about sweden on reddit some users have to spew hatred towards us just to counter the supposed circlejerk , i just wish people would stop treating countries differently for the same actions all together , but it 's never going to happen , it goes in waves though , i think the anti-sweden circlejerk is bigger than the sweden circlejerk today . 
  oh man sorry , got a bit too defensive there . 
  you said `` you sicken me '' as if todays swedes are responsible . 
  and really is not getting involved really so absolutley despicable ? 
  do you think belgium would have declared war on germany in case they had n't invaded you ? 
  you fought for them ? 
  on what front did you fight ? 
  most countries did n't, 
  [ i wrote about that ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2dj6ud/today_sweden_hasnt_formally_been_in_war_in_200/cjq2lvz ), 
  i think you missed the whole cold war . 
  able to defend in 41 ? 
  yeah maybe but it would still be just a question of time for how long we can hold out , a longer war just means more casualties , more cities bombed . 
  i do n't know , there may be some good reasons why we did n't it 's good if not all states are in the war in the end . 
  this operation could for example not have happened had sweden not been neutral : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_buses, 
  oh well then , i stand corrected . 
  why are you being mean ? 
  incorrect , there were no casualties . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-swedish_war_ ( 1810 % e2 % 80 % 9312 ) it was n't really a war , sweden and britain were allied in the napoleonic wars . 
  there is [ hearts of iron ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rot24mhpszk ) though . 
  [ ah but you know how it usually works out ] ( http://i.imgur.com/orvyh3s.jpg ) did n't you know that the only reason sweden stopped with war is that it would be unfair to everyone else ? 
  they allied germany when operation barbarossa started . 
  which i do n't think you can blame them for . 
  i will not . 
   yeah - `` sweden has n't declared war in 200 years . '', 
  it 's really nothing to brag about when you 've done exactly nothing to protect other nations that protected sweden from nazi and soviet domination . 
  there is no bragging i do n't know where you get that from . 
  which countries did anything to protect other countries from germany or soviet before they were thrown into the conflict against their will ? 
   no , not like everyone else . 
  believe or not , not every nation has been as cowardly and short term focused as sweden . 
  countries like the uk courageously made the difficult decisions and sacrifices necessary to ensure their own long term freedom and security , which goes beyond their own borders . 
  freeloading and refusing solidarity with countries that had the balls to actually do something is nothing to be proud of . 
  it 's easier to be courageous when you 're big country with a strong military and do n't have the most powerful and ruthless country in the world surrounding your land border , but yeah granted the uk were one of three countries who did declare war on germany , but that was before germany 's dominance in europe . 
  why would you interpret this post as bragging ? 
  it 's an interesting fact and quite a rarity in this world . 
  are n't we the same ? 
  who is bragging about it ? 
  the only countries who declared war on germany was france , the uk+c ommonwealth and brazil . 
  people today can go `` why were n't you in the war you cowards '' but the truth is that everyone tried to stay neutral just like us until germany declared war on them . 
  sweden is not neutral anymore , this is 2014 not 1939 . 
  we 're in the eu and we are very much involved with nato . 
  you have n't provided any facts , just made a few overly simplified and ignorant statements . 
  i guess we 're the only ones who profit from war . 
  sense of self righteousness ? 
  sweden has never taken credit for wwii . 
  we 're just glad we managed to stay out of the conflict like everyone else tried to . 
  france and the uk did declare war . 
  congratulations on your horribly simplified view on the conflict . 
  let me try and explain why i think sweden appeasing nazi germany was a good thing to do . 
  first off the swedish military was extremely weak in 1939 , after wwi we had started to disarm our military , we would n't have stood a chance in a german invasion . 
  another point is that sweden had taken a lot of refugees from denmark and norway , almost the entire jewish population managed to flee to sweden before the germans came beause of an excellent collaboration between denmark and sweden . 
  raoul wallenberg had introduced swedish safety passports in hungary to ~ 100,000 jews who all survived the war because of this . 
  and in the end of the war another swedish diplomat managed to save ~ 25,000 concentration camp prisoners and take them to sweden . 
  so let 's say sweden decided to refuse germany 's demands . 
  they would have invaded us , taken the country in maybe weeks or even days . 
  * thousends of danish , norwegian and swedish jews , political enemies and etc would have been sent to camps . 
  * ~ 100,000 hungarian jews would have been sent to camps . 
  * sweden would have been bombed and then be under occupation throughout the rest of the war . 
  * all of scandinavia would have been under nazi rule . 
  * no swedish aid to norway or training of norwegian resistance fighters in sweden would have been possible . 
  * germany would hold sweden 's resources . 
  people can say it was a cowardly move but i think humanitairianly ( ? ), 
  and strategically it was a brilliant move . 
  no we helped both sides throughout the entire war , read some of the other posts . 
  we helped norway during the occupation , their resistence movement trained here . 
  allied planes were also allowed to land here during the war after bombing germany and not having enough fuel to go back . 
   and some of the countries took it upon themselves to defend what in their eyes was the right thing to do . 
  no country took it upon themselves to defend what in their eyes was the right thing to do , they were all attacked . 
  i think i 've heard some weapons were sold to the axis aswell . 
  as it is known sweden helped both sides in the war but when we helped germany it was mostly to prevent an invasion . 
  another example of sweden helping the allies is the sinking of bismarck . 
  bismarck was first spotted by hms gotland of the swedish navy who informed the navy of it 's location which latered warned the british royal navy that it was coming so they could begin chasing it . 
  no that was one of the exceptions . 
  proud is not the right word , not ashamed either . 
  we did what every other country would have done but could n't do . 
  essentially ? 
  that 's a bit of a stretch in my opinion . 
  we allowed temporary access to allied nations aswell at some points , for example we allowed american planes to land here and transport materials into norway . 
  i guess we could say sweden was n't completely neutral to any of the sides but we stayed out of the war and that 's what mattered . 
  yes . 
  bombing civilians ? 
  yes but it was necessary to keep the peace . 
  eh , they should n't be . 
  edit : what i mean is i think they should understand that we had to do certain things to remain out of the war and i think in the end norwegians gained more from sweden staying neutral than getting invaded by nazi germany . 
  many norwegian refugees fled to sweden and the norwegian resistance trained in sweden , also sweden sent aid to norway during the occupation . 
  all countries who were invaded can say that we were cowards and they would have heroically saved all their neighbours and never agreed to terms from nazi germany to prevent an invasion , but i think in reality that 's bullshit , all countries had to think about themselves and their people first , that 's why only three countries actually declared war on nazi germany throughout the war until 1945 . 
  ( france , uk+c ommonwealth and brazil who had the luxary of being on another continent ) .

  because we obviously need more ways to confuse sweden with switzerland . 
  the swedish dialect i grew up around ( and ended up speaking a lite version of ) actually does n't have the sj-sound , so i pronounce both stj\u00e4rna and k\u00e4rna as `` k\u00e4rna '' .

  ( quick and dirty cleanup of google translation ) : ** the police are no longer able to do their job . 
  a strong contributing factor : the criminal young men in and around stockholm central station that occupy great resources from an already strained police corps . 
  ** the question is sensitive , but the problem with the young moroccan men dwelling in the center of stockholm is not unfamiliar . 
  only yesterday reports surfaced that morocco is in political discussions with interior minister anders ygeman and that the whole thing is a `` common concern '' and that they `` must find ways to identify these people . '', 
  estimates claim that hundreds of young men from morocco and other countries in north africa are in sweden right now . 
  and the group is a problem for the police and other authorities . 
  ** they steal stuff everywhere ** svt nyheter have been in contact with a police officer who wants to remain anonymous but who , among other things , has worked with groups of young men moving in and around stockholm city . 
  `` these guys are a huge problem for us . 
  they steal stuff everywhere and abuse the stewards at the central . 
  they grab girls between the legs and slap them in the face when they object . 
  all police officers know of this , '' he says . 
  on a direct question concerning the working situation of police officers in stockholm the answer comes quickly : it is disastrous . 
  `` i would never let my children go to the central station . 
  no police officer would , '' he says . 
  the problem and the frustration concerning the situation is being discussed extensively . 
  bj\u00f6rn cewenhielm , the commanding manager ( ? ), 
  for alma , stockholm region , explains . 
  `` you bring in the same guys over and over again and then they are released again , and it 's a never ending cycle . 
  it is not rare that a guy is back out on the street before the police who arrested him is , or so i 've heard . 
  and that is of course extremely frustrating for the police officer in question . 
  we the police sincerely welcome cooperation from morocco , '' he said . 
  svt nyheter has spoken to several police officers who work with young people in stockholm . 
  `` this is the only thing we 're working on and has been for a year . 
  as investigators we know who are involved and that you ca n't obtain any identification on them , '' says one of the policemen . 
  ** this is of course taking up a lot of resources ** that the young people take up a great amount of resources from the police , resources that would otherwise have gone towards preventing other juvenile crimes , is readily admitted . 
  `` this is of course taking up a lot of resources from preventing regular juvenile crimes such as theft and drugs . 
  so it is a problem . 
  but we have a clear order of priority now that it 's 2016 and the migration issues are number four on that list , and that is high up . 
  what tops it is , among other things , serious crimes and emergency alarms . 
  we must work with this , '' says bj\u00f6rn cewenhielm . 
  svt nyheter has previously reported on how the swedish authorities are at a loss as to how to deal with groups of unaccompanied minors from morocco . 
  many do not even accept the help offered during the asylum process . 
  instead they run away from the children 's homes they are placed in and live off crime . 
  ** `` i know that what is done is not right '' ** the policeman who svt nyheter talked to describes how , to `` keep your head above the water '' , the police have started to solve the problem `` in another way '' . 
  an air of resignation is clear throughout the conversation . 
  several of the policeman 's colleagues have already resigned . 
  `` we book them for public disorder instead , or lob ( law regarding disposal of the intoxicated ) . 
  then , at least , there 's some kind of punishment ; eight hours in a cell , '' he says . 
  * do they really have to resort to such measures ? 
  * `` i know that what is done is not right , but i see no other way . 
  they should not be out messing with other people . 
  i think the best thing would be if someone at the swedish police authority was questioned on the issue and had to answer . 
  but then we will have even more to do . 
  we 're on our knees now , '' he says . 
  the managers do not recognize that description . 
  `` i really hope that this is not happening . 
  lob is a law used to help people , and a person must be a danger to themselves or others for it to be applied . 
  the situation varies from case to case and it 's up to each police officer to assess the situation and how intoxicated the person is or if they 're intoxicated at all , but it can not be applied this way - no matter how frustrated you are , '' says bj\u00f6rn cewenhielm . 
  * will police officers working the central station get tired and resign or go on sick leave ? 
  * `` there always a risk . 
  there are such tendencies in all tough situations and of course it 's frustrating for them . '', 
  * sometimes these guys are transported to other cities as a solution . 
  how does that system work ? 
  * `` you can place them in foster homes , for example in other cities , but children are n't locked up , which results in them returning to stockholm quite quickly again . '', 
   assar , hallgerd , torbj\u00f6rn , alf , astrid , viv/viva and tyr , for example , are rare today [ according to scb ] ( http://www.scb.se/sv_/hitta-statistik/statistik-efter-amne/befolkning/amnesovergripande-statistik/namnstatistik/30898/30905/samtliga-folkbokforda--fornamn-och-tilltalsnamn-topplistor/31042/ ) astrid placed # 78 in the top 100 names for women in december 2014 ( up from # 79 in 2013 ) . 
  i would n't say torbj\u00f6rn is that rare either , compared to the other ones you 've mentioned . 
  fairly common , i 'd say . 
  not in the top 100 , but definitely not an unusual name .

  too bad saudi arabia contains the two holiest shrines of islam itself , so it 's just as much a strategic as economic ally .

  just because one is from x country does n't mean one is praising/shilling for them and ignoring your own nation 's faults ... 
  i agree , but the pararells is that during wwii the west had to ally with the soviet union as they had one common enemy . 
  in the future we may be forced to make a reluctant alliance with china if some sort of war happens . 
  xi jinping 's china today is hardly worse than stalin 's russia back then , but nothing to praise over apart from their scientific development .

  and it will cause a support in sd to the point of maybe 40 % or even 50 in the next election . 
  i have not believed any major terrorist attack would be likely to happen here due to our extremely beneficial support for immigrants , and low amount of population . 
  now i 'm not so sure .

  this is an subreddit about / r/europe so why not `` smaller '' events such as here . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lysenkoism wow . 
   lysenkoism ( russian : \u041b\u044b\u0441\u0435\u0301\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430 , lysenkovshchina ) was a political campaign against genetics and science-based agriculture conducted by trofim lysenko , his followers and soviet authorities . 
  lysenko served as the director of the soviet union 's lenin all-union academy of agricultural sciences . 
  lysenkoism began in the late 1920s and formally ended in 1964 . 
  the term lysenkoism can also be used metaphorically to describe the manipulation or distortion of the scientific process as a way to reach a predetermined conclusion as dictated by an ideological bias , often related to social or political objectives . 
  [ 1 ] the pseudo-scientific ideas of lysenkoism built on lamarckian concepts of the heritability of acquired characteristics . 
  [ 2 ] lysenko 's theory rejected mendelian inheritance and the concept of the `` gene '' ; it departed from darwinian evolutionary theory by rejecting natural selection . 
  [ 3 ] proponents falsely claimed to have discovered , among many other things , that rye could transform into wheat and wheat into barley , that weeds could spontaneously transmute into food grains , and that `` natural cooperation '' was observed in nature as opposed to `` natural selection '' . 
  [ 3 ] lysenkoism promised extraordinary advances in breeding and in agriculture that never came about . 
   ** joseph stalin supported the campaign . 
  more than 3,000 mainstream biologists were sent to prison , fired , [ 4 ] or executed as a part of this campaign - instigated by lysenko to suppress his scientific opponents . 
  the president of the agriculture academy was sent to prison and died there , while scientific research in the field of genetics was effectively destroyed until the death of stalin in 1953 . 
  [ 3 ] research and teaching in the fields of neurophysiology , cell biology , and many other biological disciplines was also negatively affected or banned ** . 
  and in europe we let go off privacy instead as soon as a terrorist attack happens : we 'll hear even more of `` more surveillance '' `` battle encryption '' `` ban vpns '' in the near future , not that they care for people 's lives all that much . 
  russia already has mass-surveillance and banning of porn and piracy sites etc , but at least vpns can circumvent it . 
  what has guggenheim to do with finland anyway ?

  the sound of military boots oppressing you is the same whether they call themselves communists or fascists . 
  the right to call yourself something is also a right . 
  it 's not as if labels are without value . 
  it 's as much as 60 % ** on those last crowns of income ** that made you tip over into the 60 % category . 
  it 's not 60 % on your whole income . 
  as an example , if i have a salary of 60 ' 000/month i may pay something like 22 % tax on my first 35 ' 000 crowns/month , then 40 % on the 20 ' 000 crowns/month after that , and then 60 % tax on the last 5 ' 000 . 
  the result would be 7 ' 700 +8 ' 000 +3 ' 000 = 18 ' 700 in tax , which is 31.16 % of my income . 
  these numbers are made up , both for easier math and because i do n't have the exact figures ( and it varies from county to county anyway ) , but they 're not far from reality . 
  if fn is so hardline secular , what are their grounds for opposing same-sex marriage ? 
  really ? 
  i would n't have thought , but then i only hear about him when he says xenophobic things . 
  interesting how they are n't all living up to the `` hillbilly '' stereotype at least . 
  it 's a very difficult situation , which 99 % of redditors wo n't acknowledge since they have the solution themselves . 
  in general , one should respect the culture where they are , if nothing else then due to politeness and common decency . 
  if my leaders visited japan and were expected to sit on the floor by a low table , without chairs , then i very much hope that they would conform to these expectations and respect the culture , out of politeness . 
  at the same time i do n't like the thought of them being forced to do it by law . 
  voluntary but expected is okay , and then i think the right thing to do is to conform . 
  we must also realise that foreign leaders ca n't be thrown in jail for failing to comply , so for them it is indeed a choice no matter what the law says . 
  on the other hand , the principle of sovereignty is the most important one in international affairs , if we ca n't respect the laws in other countries then what 's the point in talking to them anyway ? 
  in that case we should just move in militarily and force them to behave as we like , if we are to dispense with sovereignty and openly declare our colonialist attitude that our way is superior . 
  so in almost any circumstance i think female european leaders visiting a country where islam is the main religion should cover their hair , not because they literally have to but in order to be polite . 
  in this particular instance it is special , as the problem is that the hijab is legally mandated for all female citizens , which we consider to be oppressive , so conforming to any other part of their culture is politeness but this part is politics . 
  further exacerbated by the feminist movement in iran which explicitly called on our leaders to make a statement ( which puts them in a bit of a bind ) . 
  all of these things have to be considered . 
  ultimately , when visiting most other muslim countries i think hijab is the right choice , but in this particular case i would have preferred it if they 'd taken the opportunity to make a statement by refusing , as a way to help the feminist movement in iran which we claim to support . 
  but it is not an easy or obvious decision , anyone saying that is either lying or ignorant . 
  thank you for the explanation !, 
  if i 'm not mistaken the netherlands have pretty right-leaning economic policies , especially from our swedish point of view , even though they are very liberal ( maybe even a bit left ? ), 
  in other issues such as this one . 
  the dutch i 've talked politics with , at least , are incredulous at swedish politics and calls us communists . 
  maybe i have just met very libertarian dutch folks , i do n't know . 
  i saw that magnificent green colour and thought * `` damn right , we rule !, 
  '' * ... and then i saw those sneaky , sneaky dutch !, 
  snatching the gold medal !, 
   there is no mention of cheese pizza in the podesta e-mails political discussions on whether or not cheese pizza is mentioned in e-mails . 
  so it has come to this . 
  sometimes i just stop and marvel at the absurdity of it all . 
  yep , that 's usually the way of it . 
  and as much as i love living in a democracy where our government is held accountable , there have to be some practical limits -- i do n't think we as the public have a right to know everything when that means they ca n't do their job , which is to protect us . 
  so pushing our `` rights '' in that case only hurts ourselves . 
  and the evidence should of course be released eventually , so if there 's any funny business anyone guilty could be put to trial and/or flawed systems could be revised . 
  25-30 years until records are released should work , or something like that . 
  and as for trials , evidence * is * shown to those that have a right to know such as certain politicians and officials , so if there 's any wrongdoing uncovered someone working for the intelligence agency can still be tried and convicted , without having the evidence brought forth in the trial be public , it 's as easy as that . 
  that 's not a crime . 
  no one is saying that trump had anything to do with it , or `` masterminded it '' or something , i 'm sure he knew nothing of it . 
  it 's ridiculous to assume that he has the power to control another country 's espionage resources !, 
  there 's no point in trying to impeach trump for something like this , the * point * is that russia is flexing its muscles in the world trying to find new ways to gain more power . 
  the soviet union lost the cold war and for some time it was kind of assumed that free democracies are indeed the superior form of government for the future and so on , but now with the internet and instant communication the russians have figured out that free democracies have a big drawback they can exploit : the people 's minds are susceptible to attack , even when the country 's military is not . 
  the point is that it 's completely unacceptable that foreign powers , whether that 's russia or whoever , have a say in who governs a `` free '' country , because that 's a hard blow to that country 's freedom . 
  no country should be able to influence who ends up leading another , that 's a very dangerous road and contrary to our whole notion of sovereignty . 
  what russia is currently up to is hostile action , nothing less , and we ( i.e. 
  western countries ) all need to be aware of it so that we can defend against it . 
  for what crime ... ? 
  for trump the evidence is still classified , as it is in the hands of the intelligence agencies and they do n't like to disclose the exact details of how they got them ( because that may mean they ca n't use the same route/informer/weakness again , so it interferes with their ability to do their job ) . 
  disclosing the specific evidence to the public generally means that the details on how they got the evidence can be inferred . 
  but there is enough hard evidence for the us intelligence agencies to be certain , not just * `` we think this happened '' * but really certain , certain enough to levy a very serious accusation against a very powerful global player . 
  that 's not done on a fucking whim . 
  the evidence is not just in the intelligence bureaus ' heads either , it has of course been shown to the politicians and officials that have clearance and need to know , it just has n't been shown to the public for the reasons i stated . 
  the british intelligence service also found evidence for russian interference in the us election , so there are more than one independent source . 
   there are some old videos , interviews or just recordings of polish hooligans and sadly they 're definitely not very intellectual . 
  i get this strange picture of a hooligan , the odd one out , with a thin moustache and a beret trying to get his mates to listen to him recite shakespeare . 
  i do n't know , they do n't speak . 
  checking swedish wikipedia 's article on * f\u00e5ngarna p\u00e5 fortet * i just learned that they do n't speak because they do n't speak swedish , being french . 
  so it 's probably the same guys . 
  can not unsee . 
  with tigers !, 
  almost certainly . 
  the name means `` the prisoners in the fort '' and the game is for the teams to collect keys from various rooms with challenges in them . 
  damn i loved that show when i was a kid , it had that cool indiana jones adventure vibe !, 
  yes indeed !, 
  that got weird in translating from what i was thinking into english . 
  of course i meant stocks/shares of the company . 
  it 's extremely unlikely that article 50 is n't triggered , all kinds of mps has said that they 'll vote as their respective party expects , they 'll vote `` according to the public '' ( meaning the referendum ) , et c. et c . in other words , there 'll be enough votes in parliament to trigger it , so this changes nothing in practice . 
  in theory it 's important as prime minister may did n't want to take any chances , so she tried to go around parliament with this even though it 's pretty obvious that they should have a say . 
  the reason , as the redditor above you implied , is that it 's the parliament and not the prime minister that rules the country . 
  the power comes from parliament , because it comes from the people . 
  it 's like running a company , the ceo ( chief executive officer ) is often supposed to be the one ruling a company by folks who do n't know how it works . 
  but the ceo , or the prime minister , is only boss of the * executive * which means that they decide on day-to-day things to make everything run forward as it should . 
  they still report to a higher authority , a board of directors in the case of the ceo and parliament in the case of the pm . 
  both can be sacked by a vote from this higher authority , if they do n't do their work properly . 
  a board of directors is made up of people representing various ~ ~ market ~ ~ * stock * shares ( see note on shares below ) , and parliament is made of up people representing the public . 
  note : it is shares that confuses people sometimes when it comes to the power of ceos in some companies . 
  all companies were founded at some point , and it 's not unusual for the founder ( or family/descendants of the founder ) to keep 51 % of the share in their own hands . 
  this effectively means that the board of directors is a bit of a formality . 
  in such cases , the ceo is often ( though not always ) chosen from within the family , or perhaps it 's the founder himself . 
  this ceo is going to have a hell of a lot of juice , because he actually has two pieces of power at the same time : he 's got all the executive powers of the ceo , but he 's * also * got the power to stay ceo for as long as he likes . 
  some companies work this way , and hence the confusion , but in most cases a ceo ( or prime minister ) is n't the boss , they still report to a `` boss '' of their own . 
  / u/general _ cowbell was first , but i 'm wondering the same thing . 
  is there no one that returns to hungary after living and working abroad ? 
  i mean , the upside with a shitty low-wage economy is that ... it 's a shitty low-wage economy . 
  if you can just make some money ( abroad , clearly ) you get more bang for your buck if you move back , and then you could build a pretty big house . 
  get your family set for life .

  what ? 
  meta as in something only redditors of / r/europe would get ? 
  any european or american that went to high school has heard the word `` anschluss , '' as ww2 is the single largest part of history class in most countries . 
  i 've seen `` ausschluss '' used as a term for a german exit in my regular newspaper . 
  great joke , i hear you 're not a local . 
   i doubt that the same people that were there 1600 years ago , were already on the decline and were destroyed by hordes of invading barbarians that settled the land survived in high enough number to not be `` genetically drowned out '' . 
  this is n't true at all .

  the uk is now re-orienting its political map and this will take a lot of time , because old habits die hard . 
  there have also been reform calls within labour to listen to these white working class voters , people like maurice glasman or jon cruddas with their ` blue labour ' project but while they had ( some ) traction under miliband , corbyn essentially isolated them . 
  it 's part of the reason why he did n't connect with these voters in the remain campaign , his base is the metropolitan progressive base , often younger voters . 
  immigration restrictionism is the third rail among this group . 
  ( non-brit , but i think that 's a fair overview ) . 
   left their respective parties and formed a new , centrist party together . 
  it 's called the lib dems , too bad its run by utterly incompetent people who are seen by everyone as easy pushovers . 
   there is little to no evidence for that in the leaks https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/18/prospect-ttip-deal-undermining-eu-food-standards-gmos http://www.foeeurope.org/sites/default/files/briefing_ttip_food_safety_feb2015.pdf  not really . 
  look at trade barriers and tariffs between eu and us on the wto website and come back when you 're more informed . 
  the leftover blairite/brownite establishment never saw his win as legitimate . 
  using brexit as a pretext gives them the cover to do the coup they have dreamt of from the moment he got elected . 
  but the underlying point you raise is of course not going anywhere : who exactly would replace him ? 
  would the base forgive such a palace coup and a neoliberal replacement ? 
  i for one would n't mind seeing labour split in half . 
  a neoliberal , technocratic , metropolitan version and a more bennite old labour type of party on the other . 
  the big question would then be on immigration . 
  those who would be more bennite-inclined but are pro-immigration would probably need a third party , since their economic views are too different from the neoliberals and their immigration views are too starkly diverged from the white working class base in middle england . 
  the big unknown is ukip . 
  if it re-orients its economic views more towards the left , it could fulfull that role for middle england even more , but as long as an ex-city of london type as farage sits at the helm , i view that as unlikely , if not impossible . 
  key q is if rest of eu would accept waiting that long ? 
  we are already hearing calls from the foreign ministers of france and germany that eu needs to accelerate article 50 regardless of the october tory convention so as to , in their words , `` not being held hostage to internal uk politics '' . 
  pushing a new election to january would prolong this even further . 
  the big question is whether the eu has the legal powers to force an article 50 against the consent of the hmg . 
  option 2 would be if it `` heavily nudges '' cameron to declare one anyway , against his explicit words . 
  but if he refuses anyway , then it could be in a limbo . 
   ttip  actually benefiting trade your poor soul , 
  trade negotiations are not nuclear secrets . 
  if you ca n't sell the innards of any deal to the general public and want to push past it with minimal time for reading , then you should re-consider your approach . 
  just because it is a common approach does n't make it the * right * approach . 
  plus , you never adressed the issue that most eu/us trade barriers are already very low so the incremental benefits are extremely minor . 
  most of the ttip was , as i said , just lowering eu standards ( labour laws , environmental laws , food safety laws etc ) for us corporations . 
  funny how you sidestepped that . 
  i 'm speaking very selfishly here , but i would not mind seeing a podemos/socialist spain . 
  we 've had too much ordoliberal-led austerity in europe . 
  spain has issues , but it is now clear its issues are managable , unlike that of italy who was already stagnating many years before the 2008 crisis . 
  i had hoped france would be a counter-weight to germany , but alas , hollande proved to be utterly ineffectual . 
  sweden has a social democratic government on paper but in reality we 've always been mini germany and whatever our german cousins think or say , we blindly follow , just like the austrians . 
  i 'm aware that the chance of chaos rises with this election , but spain is also not greece in terms of political dysfunction . 
  belgium did not have a government for two full years after the crisis , and it managed to get its act together . 
  above all , we need a strong voice for change in the eu . 
  the v4 are keeping germany 's worst impulses ( and ours ) in check on border control . 
  but nobody is keeping the austerity doctrine down , and hopefully a socialist government in spain with decent mandate would change that . 
  europe needs fiscal union asap and it needs to abandon the sch\u00e4uble disaster of internal devaluation . 
  of course the major risk would be that spain would instantly be consumed by a possible independence vote in catalonia and thus retreat from the eu stage . 
  i do n't mind . 
  ttip was a giant mess in the first place . 
  everything held secret , most barriers between us/eu are already gone . 
  most of the stuff was about lowering eu standards for us corporations . 
  good riddance . 
  snap election when ? 
  yep . 
  things are now moving so fast , it 's silly to make predictions even more than 1 year ahead . 
  corbyn is facing a no-confidence vote in the coming days . 
  we could see two new major political leaders in the uk within the next few months and then a snap election immediately after . 
  whoever would win such a snap election would significantly influence the negotiations and as such , the entire situation would fundamentally change . 
  to make any definitive statements at this point is foolhardy at best . 
  people buy the new yorker because of its writing , not its cartoons . 
  i was making an aesthetic point about seeing more well-crafted handdrawn covers . 
  i do n't think it is a major economic issue for magazines , it 's more a question of taste of the editors/publishers . 
  how could an editor know that the reader likes a certain aesthetic just by sales figures ? 
  it is impossible . 
  that 's why it 's stupid to think i could influence any style decision by an anonymous buying decision . 
  it would have to come from the people running the magazine . 
  i was simply making an off-hand comment about my own personal preferences for handdrawn covers . 
  it would be silly - and yes , daft - to draw that inference into an economic decision . 
  if a magazine does international coverage then it is reasonable to expect it should be better than conventional wisdom repackaged in better prose . 
  if it only did ny-related news , it would be different . 
   i 'm a bosnian-american you live in bosnia , now , i assume ? 
  ( looking at flair ) .

  so the big three refugee destination countries , sweden , austria and germany , were the same then as is now . 
  the big difference is how many the hungarians took . 
  and hungary took in even more per capita than you . 
  game over !, 
   i 'm not sure it 's ever attempted to be anything else therein lies the problem . 
  too parochial of the beltway media . 
  it 's written a lot better than most of them , but it does n't have the same internationalist ambition that older magazines had ( like time during its peak in the 1960s-1980s ) . 
  that 's probably more a general critique of the american media , though , but new yorker is part of that culture . 
  i personally think der spiegel does better international writing , for instance . 
  some of the asian english-language magazines are also better , and not just because they cover more places outside the west , their coverage of the western issues also tend to be a bit more coolheaded/less one-sided to one particular view . 
  this is especially on issues like western internvention , where the new yorker has not exactly been great . 
  it supported the iraq war for instance . 
  its literature writing is also bested by the lrb and the nrb . 
  i find it a decent magazine but not exceptional , as i said . 
  what kind of question is that ? 
  his rant against van rompoy was pretty amusing . 
  still not worth it , though . 
  i 'm not talking about classes , but demographics . 
  you keep insisting looking at the data is somehow communism . 
  it 's hilarious . 
  you have presented no data whatsoever except wishful thinking . 
  i never said i wanted to restrict all ee workers , which is what you keep pretending it was . 
  a nation like czechia which for instance does not suffer from massive brain drain would n't be affected , ditto estonia . 
  it would only be put in place in nations which had a massive population decline . 
  this simple fact has taken you god-knows-how-many comments to get around to and you still do n't get it . 
  you still pretend as if i want to make some kind of massive border wall to all ee nations or whatever . 
  that 's why i said , read better next time , it helps .

   though i dare say you might just win that fight and sweden becomes west estland . 
  worth noting that 501 of those drowned were swedes , so this was and still is a huge deal there . 
  this was one of the single largest loss of swedish lives in modern history . 
  it seemed everyone knew someone affected by the disaster . 
  the death toll per nationality was : 501 swedes 284 estonians 17 latvians 11 russians 10 finns and more of atleast 10 different nationalities .

  that 's the swedes racial ability . 
  d'uh . 
  the people who are most focused on what 's wrong in a country is the politicians in the opposition . 
  try and ask them !, 
  in gymnasium , our religion teacher ( for the mandatory ` religion ' course ) doubled as both a swedish teacher and society-knowledge teacher ( samh\u00e4llskunskap ? ) . 
  i think they receive a short education about the course for permission to teach it , but do n't quote me on this , then they basically follow the curriculum . 
  we dedicated a couple of weeks each to buddhism , hinduism , judaism , christianity and islam . 
  of course now days , all teachers require a university-level education and they can specialize in specific topics . 
  in elementary school , religion is taught in the same class as geography , history and society ( we call it so ; society-orientated topics or samh\u00e4llsorienterade \u00c4mnen ) and often by the same teacher . 
  sounds like flies buzzing . 
  i feel this thing about heritage less tricky than it seems . 
  as a swede , i sure find it interesting to know where my ancestors came from . 
  i visited a relative who had done some researching into my family and he 'd come over a church text 500 years old in norrland which a distant relative of mine wrote . 
  my fathers father claims there 's some dutch/walloon blood in his side of the family , even though i 'm shining blond and blue-eyed . 
  so with that in mind i can claim to be of norrlandic/svealandic/dutch heritage . 
  the ancestors for americans is even less far removed then so , so i see no problems with an american finding interest in their half swedish , quarter finnish , quarter german heritage . 
  i can see why americans feel it 's more important . 
  i can safely say to have had family ties in sweden for at least 500 years , and humans have populated europe in at least 17 ' 000 years . 
  but an american can have had a relative just three generations ago emigrate from europe . 
  and which part they emigrated from in such a culturally diverse continent can be quite interesting . 
  many feel family and ancestry is important , it 's a basic human feature and is why the middle-ages were so dominated with family legacy and the `` family name '' . 
  of course , if you go back 20 generations i 'm probably related with all ethnic swedes ; 50 generations every ethnic european and probably a lot of the rest of the world . 
  go even further and i 'll find family ties to every living thing on this planet , animals , plants and bacteria . 
  that 's basic biology for ya . 
  so what do i feel about americans claiming heritage ? 
  i say go for it !, 
  i do n't mind in the slightest . 
  just stop . 
  ouch . 
  ** edit : ** for those who do n't know , the sinking of m/s estonia in 1995 is one of the worst maritime disasters in the 20th century , and the worst ever in the baltic , claiming 852 lives . 
  500 of them were swedish , i do n't know about the rest but definitely a majority of finns/estlanders . 
  one of those disasters which will never be forgotten . 
  we just copied it literally and call it * mjukvara * and * h\u00e5rdvara * .

  this article is somewhat uninformed and stupid , and i 'm saying that as a swede who wants to see our gripens exported .

  now , with its battle-capabilities i would n't know , but i would n't trust reddits opinion on it . 
  however , two reasons for its lousy reputation known to me : 1 . 
  it 's very affordable . 
  people usually equate cheap with crap . 
  it got a lot of flak because of two highly publicized crashes with early prototypes . 
  not a record which stands out among its competitors , it had some major problems with it 's fly-by-wire systems which caused both crashes . 
  the difference though was that both were extremely publicizied and televised ; one crashed in the middle of stockholm ( no causalties ) while showing off maneuvers during the water festival which was witnessed by tens of thousands of spectators . 
  it made headlines for weeks in sweden .

  how about using district heating ? 
  you could use the spillheat from industries , garbage incineration and the waste from e.x woodworking to help alleviate the need for gas . 
  is it something commonly used in germany , or would it be undesirable ?

  thank you france for sticking up for the rest of us euros when our own governments are being retarded . 
  lots of love from sweden,

  i 've got a netflix premium subscription plan , but when your dear hollywood applies shitty geo-restriction and geo-blocking practices for individual shows/movies , i start torrenting them . 
  i 'm still paying for the content , i 'm just not standing for your country 's fucked up reasoning about restricting me just because i 'm not a us citizen . 
  and you should be happy that i am one of those paying customers , since i am contributing to the health of * your * economy . 
  the problem is that hollywood wants to be on the european market , but expects europeans to stand for their reasoning about restricting access to content for non-us citizens . 
  either you 're in the market , or you 're out . 
  simple as that . 
  we 're also having a eu vote soon to ban geo-restriction and geo-blocking for media entertainment , and it may very well happen that hollywood-based producers are getting banned from the european entertainment market ( if they keep up with their geo-restriction and geo-blocking practices ) , which is drastically going to hurt the us economy . 
  you do n't see the swedish-invented spotify platform restricting access to their music library to you just because you 're not a swedish citizen , do you ?

  i apologize if i came off as doing that . 
  but that 's the problem really , those are * your laws * , not ours . 
  the only thing that the us should be able to do is to take down those servers , collaborate with ukraine ; e.g handing over information to help the ukrainian government arrest and prosecute the individual in question . 
  but the us should not be able to steal the individual , prosecute him in the us and put the guy in a us prison ( if it comes to that ) . 
  this is outrageous . 
  it 's really like non-us citizens are treated as second class citizens in the world . 
  there 's never been a case where a us citizen has been extradicted , prosecuted and put in prison in another country .

  / r/dota2 is leaking again, 
  i disagree with your view that europe has always lacked innovation in the tech field . 
  i 'll take my own country as an example , which at the time these companies were started had around an 8 million population . 
  skype , spotify and mojang ( minecraft ) are 3 pretty good examples , two of which were bought by microsoft . 
  king ( candy crush & other mobile games ) , dice ( battlefield-series ) and paradox ( lots of popular games ) are other successful examples . 
  then there 's also linux , ( linus tovalds is finno-swedish ) which powers pretty much the entire internet and has led to our awesome open-source culture that we share . 
  to say europe `` has n't got off the starting line to begin with '' is not very true if you look at it . 
  i think there are lots of innovation in the tech field in europe , maybe not as much as in the us , but it definitely is there . 
  a big problem we have is that european tech companies either ca n't or wo n't compete with us salaries , which naturally leads to europe losing its top talent . 
  that is a problem we have to address if we want to grow our economy alongside the us in this era of technology . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm not saying `` the us is bad '' like this sub so often does say . 
  rather , i think the exact opposite - i love that the us & the eu has had a close relationship the last few decades , and that we 're able to connect with you guys across the pond , especially in the tech field since that 's my line of work . 
  a big reason the us is home to big tech companies is beacuse they have what i call a `` bird 's view '' over the european ( and american of course ) tech startups . 
  the same minute a european tech startup grows even the slightest bit more popular , the giants like google , facebook , etc - * will know * . 
  often times buying the startup and the individual talent with it , even if it 's just a competitor . 
  how ? 
  well , google and facebook knows because they track the browsing habits and history of people . 
  last week , 20,000 people used `` european startup x '' . 
  this week , 200,000 people use it . 
  there was a very detailed comment about this with lots of examples on another sub a few months back , i 'll see if i can find it . 
   you can not seriously believe that only europe does subcontracting and outsourcing . 
  he never said that , and how does it matter for europe what other regions do ? 
  we should focus on ourselves , not `` look , canada does it , so it 's ok if we do too '' . 
   how 's that relevant ? 
  has a a tech talent ever said darn i wan na go to europe but the refugee thing ... meh , guess i 'll skip . 
  that 's not how i interpreted it , and i think he meant that the migrants overall does not have the education or skills to fill a tech position .

  unfortunately i do n't have a playlist dedicated to metal , since i listen to a wide range of music types .

  hey , you 're the ones that has swedish people 's party .

  spotify is swedish at least, 
  zero rating is a slippery slope . 
  it goes against a competing market and creates a monopoly for the already established services like spotify , making it extremely hard for other companies to even try to compete . 
  and as we all know , competition is good for the consumers . 
  lastly , these x amount of gb per month plans are also * extremely bad * for innovation and competition . 
  they discourage carriers to innovate to create the highest quality , fastest and most reliable network among its competitors . 
  instead they just put an artificial limit and pretty much call it a day . 
  nobody today looks at how good the network of their carrier actually is ( bandwidth throughput ( mbit/sec ) , latencies and packet routing ) , and instead looks at the artificial limit that is how many gb/month they can use before they 're being throttled .

  i assume that 's for the rape accusation , but what about the bail breakage ? 
  i do n't think there 's any international water between denmark and sweden in the sound . 
  going via the pacific ocean might be a better idea . 
  he could even go to reunion if he does n't fancy a trip around the world . 
  still seems a bit `` knee-jerky '' and childish , does n't it ? 
   it is if a guarantee is given . 
  there 's no legal way to make guarantees . 
  we 've been through this already . 
  who would even make it ? 
  the government is made up of people who happened to win the last election and whomever they chose to employ . 
  any such guarantee , even if legally possible , could be made irrelevant at any time . 
  if i was assange , that would not be good enough . 
   the process you described earlier follows the initial review . 
  which in turn follows an extradition request . 
   ** before ** the government makes a decision on the request , the prosecutor-general shall deliver ** a statement of opinion ** on the matter . 
  in addition , if the person referred to in the request has ** not consented ** to being extradited , the case shall be tried by the supreme court . 
   and i do n't know if you beat your wife . 
  you certainly do n't , but i 'm not the one the us is supposedly trying to prosecute . 
   sure , sure . 
  go back and read what i actually wrote . 
  i realise you 're in a frame of mind now where it might be hard to be impartial , but i really was just speculating . 
   first , it has n't been satisfactorily proven that manning met assange over irc or jabber in the first place . 
  as i understand it it is just what manning assumed , so no . 
   that throws a different light on things , and for me challenges the authenticity of this `` forensic '' data . 
  it sure does . 
  it would mean that if manning was using a high-density disk , that johnson falsified the logs . 
   manning explicitly said no identifying information was exchanged : then maybe that 's one less thing assange can be legally extradited for . 
   you labelling it `` inciting crimes '' does not make it so , and what 's more , journalists entice sources to provide classified material all the time . 
  so no , not really . 
  i 'm still just speculating . 
  i do n't know if assange had any contact with manning prior to the leak , but if he did talk him into it , then that would be a crime . 
   i read what you cited , i presume i can trust you ? 
  or ca n't i ? 
  well , i just copy pasted it from the english translation of the law linked to from the governmental page someone else linked to earlier , so i really hope so . 
  however , nothing i quoted had anything to do with hypothetical requests . 
   yes , order as in when you put on your boxer shorts on before your socks . 
  not order as in : pre-emptive refusal of extradition is illegal . 
  the government has the final say . 
  if the order in which you put on your clothes was regulated by law , then putting them on in the wrong order ** would ** be illegal . 
  yes , the government has the final say , not the first . 
   by a court ? 
  no , not that i 'm aware of : yes , you are correct . 
  appeals at this stage are obviously not handled by the courts . 
   that was ten days earlier . 
  they just could n't make up their mind ... uhm , eva fine dropped the investigation , borgstr\u00f6m ( not the government ) requested the review , and marianne ny picks it up . 
  you seem to imply that there was more back and forth than that . 
   but you can build a ladder . 
  anything that is not illegal is not illegal . 
  this goes without saying . 
  yes , they could build a framework , i.e change the law . 
  you can not possibly enumerate everything people or institutions are allowed to do . 
  this is an unattainable fantasy : the book of allowed things would contain more information than the observable universe could hold . 
  it 's obviously not an enumeration , but their functions are defined and regulated . 
  you really think the government should have more powers than those stated in the law ? 
  if it does n't explicitly state that they ca n't kidnap children , then they should be able to do so legally ? 
   no it does n't . 
  it cites the swedish government as follows : yes , that 's specifies in the law , but its not obvious in this case . 
  also , the highlighted part is the consequence of the unhighlighted part , i.e. 
  a direct result of an actual , existing , request . 
  this is what i said , so they agree with me , or rather the law does . 
   so , let 's say we go with your `` strict chronological order '' as a matter of legal necessity : you just got served . 
  thanks . 
  yeah , no i was n't . 
  that condition is a part of that very chronological order . 
  just not applicable in this case . 
   and i 'm quite familiar with the type of people who will defend their country right or wrong , good for you , and good for me that it just happens to be right in this case . 
   and the type of people who want a less transparent society with less civil liberties , less government transparency and restrictions on the freedom of the press . 
  people who support governments who rule with an iron fist , trampling over the judicial process and human rights , whatever it takes to silence dissent . 
  i really hope you do n't think i 'm one of them for wanting my government to ** not ** trample the judicial process , because i 'm very much pro-transparity and against dictatorships . 
  it really has nothing to do with this case , so i will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you just went of on some irrelevant tangent . 
   first , because assange is not a u.s. citizen and is no more guilty of manning 's actions than greenwald , gellman , poitras or macaskill are of snowden 's . 
  ( who is a legitimate whistleblower anyway and should have never been charged ) well , i do n't know if he incited manning . 
  i 'm just speculating about what they could possibly try to pin on him . 
   second , although there is very clear and distinct difference between manning and assange ( and wikileaks ' submission mechanism via onion routing effectively denied assange the identity of manning to begin with ) , manning should have never been convicted in the first place , because he is a whistleblower , if it was snowden , i 'd agree . 
  no tor networks in the world can prevent contact if the two meet on irc and jabber first , which is the case here . 
   no , not really yeah , really . 
  inciting crimes is not what journalists normally do . 
   there is no legal impediment for the swedish government to address assange 's extradition concerns , and i have the sources you yourself quoted elsewhere in this thread to thank for this knowledge . 
  you mean the source you clearly did n't read ( nor do i actually think linked to it ) ? 
  the government has addressed it though . 
  they have described the legal protection he would have . 
   no , the government has the final say period , as per your own sources . 
  then you need to read it again . 
  the order off events is extremely clear . 
  i even highlighted some of the key phrases for you people . 
   indeed , they should n't have revived a baseless rape case as they did . 
  the investigation into rape was not revived by the government , but by a court after the decision to drop it was appealed by the women 's legal counsel . 
   exercising their right to ultimately deny an illegitimate extradition request is not a problem , though , because that 's what swedish law allows , as per your own sources . 
  please quote the section ( s ) that gives the government the right to guarantees against hypothetical extradition requests . 
   yes , and i thank you for proving my points . 
  you clearly did n't then . 
   if there is `` no legal framework whatsoever '' , there is nothing forbidding them . 
  that 's not how the government or the law works . 
  the functions of the government are regulated by the law . 
   there is , however , a legal framework for the government to refuse extraditions , and nowhere in your text does it state the government is precluded from pre-emptively denying one .

  looking back 20 years , turkey is on the right track . 
  looking back five , it is stalling . 
  in sweden , it is standard practice to apply for residence permit before you come here , if it is the first time you apply . 
  you can * renew * it from here . 
  it 's pretty common that you have to go back home before you get a new visa , though . 
  your profile does sound like a match for brussels . 
  international , french speaking , english speaking skills are highly appreciated , rich food culture , a lot of fine dining . 
  you would need work * before * you go , though . 
  turkey 's total fertility rate at the moment is 2.18 , and decreasing . 
  the turks are not going to swamp the rest of europe any time soon . 
  the us ( if somehow transplanted to europe ... ) would not be welcome either , because of your death penalty , especially how it 's applied to people who would n't even be considered legally responsible for their actions in the eu countries . 
  turkey has significant problems , that must be dealt with , but demanding that all of their problems should be * erased * before we should even consider membership is hypocritical . 
  if you think turkey is that poor , please check your sources . 
  how come this well-argued comment is downvoted in favor of `` lol '' ? 
  even when a government is really taking care of its economy , it still takes about 20 years to halve a debt . 
  that 's what sweden has managed since the early 90 's . 
  so yeah , roll it over , and pay it off in small chunks when the situation stabilizes . 
  i voted pirate party . 
  i doubt i need to check were they stand . 
  just a thing i noticed at the airport in helsinki . 
  it 's been a bad year for the swedish royal family . 
  nope , finnish newspapers write about the swedish monarch 's scandals . 
  oops , thank you for pointing out my stupidity . 
  the comments are standard dunnel-kruger . 
  it 's quite a long poem with lots of word and many with alternative spelling that are considered archaic . 
  still the were chiding the first guy who said he had problems with 19 . 
  i wager that most of the rest were skimming while thinking `` yeah , i know that '' . 
  word order reversal . 
  i saw that he fell . 
  on my way home i saw that he fell . 
  you did n't see that he fell . 
  on your way home , something happened that you did n't see . 
  ( notice that `` inte s\u00e5g '' is different from `` s\u00e5g inte '' ), 
  another thing with russian ( and some other slavic languages too , i figure ) is that there are declinations for names !, 
  if you know someone 's name , that 's not enough to put it in a sentence , you also have to know the declination . 
  russian/slavic native speakers ( and many other ) do have a problem with understanding the rationale behind `` a '' and `` the '' and it takes a long time to pick up . 
  the thing about accent is that you have to choose one . 
  then it become bizarre , because you fake localize yourself . 
  a german that speaks english with a southern accent is just odd . 
  `` the japanese language that speaks '' ( or possibly `` spoken japanese '' ), 
  the spoken language/written language divide is larger , though . 
  no , slavic languages are harder . 
  you have to put in some hard work just to get basic grammar in the right ballpark . 
  that 's because they speak mozambican in mozambique !, 
  ( etc ), 
  yeah , if i 'm not mistaken , mixed style writing ( hangul + chinese characters ) has gone completely out of fashion . 
  well , this is r/europe after all !, 
  and in singapore , cantonese is forbidden on the local tv channels . 
  in swedish , every time you use a comma ( i.e. 
  sentence fragment ) native speakers expect a word order mistake . 
  you forgot about austria and switzerland . 
  sweden has too , although there are still battery hen farmers with `` special permits '' around . 
  hopefully there 's an end date to those permits . 
  this makes me some kind of proud as a swede , lol ( norwegians are not baristas ) . 
  that 's the slavic name . 
   anti federal establishment this is exactly what i implied : anti washington dc , anti-lobby , anti big banking , anti big corporations . 
  i meant it in the sense that those who influence the federal government and legislation today will do their best to combat him . 
  extreme as in `` most anti-establishment '', 
  jean-marie le pen was second in the race for presidency in france , and he does n't really fit the descriptor `` sane '' . 
  yeah , i 'm sure he meant \u00c5bo . 
  hey , thats \u00d6resundsbron !, 
  sarajevo used to be a cool city though . 
  i guess the war and the snipers fixed that . 
  it would have been an embarrassment at home for that party , guaranteed . 
  that 's correct , yes . 
  did you read my comment ? 
  representatives from the ruling parties came and interrupted a seminar they were not invited to . 
  it was n't a debate . 
  but you ca n't deny that something quite contrary to the idea of free speech is going on . 
  at a seminar in sweden some hungarian writers were invited to talk about this . 
  the seminar was not a discussion of the topic , it clearly said that the hungarian writers were giving their views on the matter . 
  the event was disturbed by people from the hungarian embassy and ruling parties that tried to intervene in the presentations and protested that their views were not `` fairly represented '' at this seminar . 
  it was pretty similar to how angry muslims tried to disrupt a seminar held by lars vilks at the same university . 
  something seriously fishy is going on . 
  the uk as a whole is certainly a mixed bag , but well-educated asians and africans that ca n't seem to find work in sweden often go to london and get employed a lot easier . 
  engineers and it professionals do ok in sweden on english alone . 
  in the long run people don ] t like to talk english casually , though . 
  who are they ? 
  and what would they stand to gain ? 
  the interviewed people on swedish radio today . 
  they were not alarmed `` everyone is talking about a crisis , but our interest rates are going down . 
  i think it 's blown out of proportion '' . 
  yeah , right . 
  well , there you have it : machismo again . 
  self-expression values is something completely different , such as not beating people up for behaving different . 
  a typical example would be the attitude towards gays . 
  check this out : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:inglehart_values_map.svg in some aspects of life , there are stark differences , and they should be recognized . 
  same here , i have problems with many russians because of their `` survival values '' ( as opposed to `` self-expression values '' ) . 
  in many ways , that translates to machismo , showing off your strength and misogyny . 
  well , we see what you * export * . 
  europe mainstream cultural export ( mainly music , i guess ) is pretty crappy too . 
  that 's one side of the story . 
  i think the bigger issue is that no-one cared enough about the systemic risks involved in creating an entire financial money-making engine on the assumption that real estate would always go up in value . 
  and how that led to institutions such as aig to issue cdo 's for billions without setting aside a single dollar for covering payouts . 
  what southern europe got was cheaper credit . 
  sure , but would private lenders have agreed on a 50 % haircut at the time ? 
  the us should probably have bailed out lehman brothers too , they just did n't know how far the dominos ran . 
  few in government did . 
  we 've all read how brown was taken aback by how vulnerable the whole system was . 
  but i agree in one way : germany refused to do much in 2010 because it was politically inconvenient to do so at the time .

  but the reason we have become so rich is not very clear , at least not scandinavia as a whole . 
   the whole community is build around the majority of people having off sunday . 
  let 's throw that away because a few people wan na work on sunday even tho they can do that already . 
  and the other way around my whole community is built around stuff being open on sundays , so it would be stupid to throw that away because a few people do n't like working on sundays . 
   let 's not forget that there is a difference between students that have to work to be able to attend university and students that work just to have more spending money ... 
  i agree , but we pay our students enough that they should n't have to work unless they want to or have other issues . 
  figured we needed a new thirty years war , but this time under our new estonian overlords . 
   and not many are working in retail sales to begin with some do , so suddenly banning it would kinda suck . 
  i 'm sure there are other groups than students who like working on weekends too . 
  especially considering the extra pay you get compared to weekdays . 
   if you ca n't see that being green at all you should probably check your eyes . 
  then  i can see the green a bit but it 's definitely more blue . 
  then  so you 're either a little colorblind or have your monitor settings set up badly . 
  i 'm seeing the same thing you are , you 're just certain it 's blue , i 'm saying different people see it differently , which is pretty common knowledge , have you never heard about that ? 
  if you want to be specific you should call it turquoise or something like that , calling it blue is just as wrong as calling it green , since it 's in the middle of the two ( and exactly where the line is varies from person to person , and language ) . 
  but since there is n't any other green or blue on the map that hardly matters . 
  i 'm talking about having sundays available to work in shops and such . 
  since we do n't have school then a lot of us take up extra work on weekends , if shops closed on sundays a lot of us would have less opportunity to work . 
  probably you . 
  it 's right in between green and blue , could be called either , op chose green . 
  if you ca n't see that being green at all you should probably check your eyes . 
  they do n't need the money . 
  not need-need at least , i mean they are going on holidays to central america and stuff , so do n't think money is a huge problem . 
  students here get around 1000 $ combined grant and loan per month , that 's enough to live on unless you have a way too expensive apartment or something . 
   either they do n't care about the lectures and prefer the money this . 
  it 's usually the people who are doing good in school anyway that are working , the people who are just managing to pass do n't look for extra work . 
   if students want to work for extra money , we should n't have special derogation for that or use them as scapegoats for opening on sunday . 
  it 's not specifically about students , that was just an example of how it benefits some people . 
   they want extra money , they can work the same days as everyone else . 
  which they do , and that happens to include sundays here . 
  which is a preferred workday for students since they do n't have school then and it pays more than a normal weekday . 
  so taking that away would make us sad , since we would have less opportunity to work during the school year . 
  no , they are not allowed to employ you for that many days in a row , so working all week does not become the norm . 
  it does normalise working on weekends though , so in a lot of jobs you are expected to work some weekends , but then you get other days off instead . 
  working on weekends or evenings also pays better , so people who can work then without problems often wants to ( like students ) , making it not as necessary for others to do it . 
  being able to do it saturday & sunday is really nice though , especially since you get extra pay during those days ( and even more on evenings ) . 
  monday - friday we have school , some people work those days too , but they tend to miss lectures and stuff sometimes , which is n't optimal . 
  most people who work full time tend to not want to work on weekends too , so perfect opportunity for students to earn some extra money . 
   students have enough work studying and should n't have to worry about holding a job . 
  most of my classmates have extra jobs , we might not need more money , but we can still want more . 
  i [ think ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/st_peter%27s_square%2c_vatican_city_-_april_2007.jpg ) [ you ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3670066/images/o-rome-facebook.jpg ) [ would ] ( https://www.electatravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rome03.jpg ) [ love ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/pantheon_front.jpg ) [ rome ] ( http://www.umary.edu/_resources/images/heros/1600x600_rome_evening.jpg ) . 
  there are usually a ton of tourists everywhere , but it should be a great place for painting . 
   this is really as typical as they can get . 
  [ sweden confirmed as communist country ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@57.7221858,11.9294019,3a,75y,121.5h,88.67t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sepilkw4acev293xjzyynrq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) seriously though , those types of houses actually look alright , even when not maintained they still have a bit of soul ( or whatever ) left , imo . 
  the [ later commieblocks ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@57.7155838,11.9261256,3a,74.1y,159.39h,90.73t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sdszp2spl8vea1ih8kbudtw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) are a lot worse . 
  not exactly health spas , but i see your point . 
  they live about as well as me , a poor student . 
  but they ca n't leave , which sucks a bit i 'm guessing . 
  also worth noting that it does n't actually work worse than harsher prison environments ( some even say it works better ) . 
  which you know , is almost relevant to the original discussion . 
  it has been banned in sweden since the 70s . 
  are you saying entire generations over here have not been raised properly ? 
   i was somewhat surprised that these guys just marched to the immigration armed to the teeth , and the officers were like `` cool , can i take your photo ? '' . 
  all the people in the pictures were asked to dress up for the photo . 
  so they probably did n't travel dressed like that . 
  they are not doing too well in sweden . 
  probably because people are n't that obsessed with getting the lowest prices , it 's more important that they know what they are getting and that sort of stuff . 
  i think lidl seems a little bit foreign to most swedes . 
  netto and willys are competitors too . 
  but they follow the union rules and everything , afaik . 
  so no real problems with their workers . 
  m\u00e5rran in swedish , so your name is actually pretty close to the original . 
  can try it with minttu ( finland ) instead , sounds like the same thing , but 50 % alcohol . 
  seriously dangerous though since the peppermint masks the alcohol taste really well . 
  ] ( http://www.drinko.se/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/5b4ce2e974906a11297266e0d7bca680/m/i/minttu-peppermint-50_big-img__1.jpg ), 
  elsa for girls , not surprisingly popular due to frozen ( i 'm guessing ? 
  ) , but it was a common name with old women here already . 
  i 'm eagerly awaiting karl-g\u00f6ran , sven-erik , per-gunnar and such getting in fashion again , haha . 
  fair enough . 
  english . 
  i share a kitchen with 8 other people , 4 of them do n't speak swedish . 
  and the teacher in my current course at uni is american , although he does speak swedish it is often easier to communicate in english . 
  i guess it gets a lot colder inland . 
  i 've only ever lived on the coast , so do n't have a complete picture . 
  sliced meat for sandwiches i think is common , but anything other than than that is not popular at all . 
  but you can still get it , have eaten whole turkey a few times . 
  we do n't have it for holidays or anything like that . 
  although i think one of the times i had it it was on a `` second '' christmas party , with friends instead of family . 
  did n't want a repeat of the traditional food i guess . 
  yeah , but `` european '' is n't just western europe . 
  i feel a lot closer to someone from the us than someone from bulgaria for example . 
   i 'd say places where people regularly throwing stones at the police & emergency crew is n't something that exists in most countries . 
  `` regularly '' ? 
  rainy and grey . 
  and obviously the police has to be more careful in certain areas , might not have the best reception from the locals . 
  but i 'm pretty sure areas like that exist more or less in almost every country . 
  imo : blekingsk  swedish  nordic/scandinavian  western ( or something like that ) european is only about geography , all the people from countries in europe are `` european '' . 
  but there is very little cultural significance about it . 
  while i could definitely talk about `` western '' culture or whatever , which would include the us , canada , australia and so on . 
  btw , i sort of secretly wish blekinge could just join up with sk\u00e5ne so i would n't have to explain to everyone i meet where blekinge is . 
  most of the time i just get to be from `` somewhere near sk\u00e5ne '' ... 
   and it 's difficult to get to and get around . 
  it 's fine if you have a car . 
  but yeah , not sure what to do there , except skiing . 
  somewhere in austria or southern germany is probably better . 
   it sounds like you do n't like when it turns dark early , why ? 
  i do n't know , i 'm human , we like daylight . 
  it would be fine if it was just a day or something , but when it 's constantly like that for months it 's not so fun . 
  a couple years back i worked in the basement of a factory during winter , no windows , not even in the break room . 
  so i went to work at 7:30 , when it was still dark .

  it 's not really news . 
  she 's been saying this for half a decade . 
  or making an example of someone who was annoying in order to make their job easier in the future . 
  well , it wo n't necessarily be a * pleasant * stay . 
  but you 'll get to stay . 
  in some form . 
  i do n't know if it has ever actually happened , though . 
  yeah , but that does n't get you asylum . 
  if you get asylum , you 're guaranteed food and some kind of housing for a while . 
  i think you get free swedish lesson regardless , because if you do n't have a job it 'll help you get one and if you had one when you moved then we 'd love to give you one more reason to stay and keep paying taxes . 
  i was expecting a greek flair to go with that statement . 
  considering that there 's no shortage of europeans trying to sell the same idea , the smugglers would n't have to try very hard to provide sources . 
  demographical challenges and all that . 
  i guess both are interesting ways to die . 
  well , there you go . 
  that 's settled , so let 's go get drunk . 
  it 's at least theoretically possible . 
  if they 'd face the death penalty for something if they went home , i do n't think finland can refuse them . 
  but i may be mistaken , so try to avoid getting sentenced to death as a strategy for moving to finland . 
   that 's about 6m votes out of a pool of 45m registered voters . 
  assuming their voters are twice as likely to actually turn up as other parties , which is just wild speculation . 
  unless there 's a serious study saying otherwise , we have to assume that the election result is representative of the whole population . 
  even if there is such a study , it 's still representative of the people who care enough to vote , wand they 're the people who matter . 
  ** every ** time there 's an election result that someone disagrees with , they immediately claim that they would have won if turnout had been higher and that they * should * have been the winners . 
  and in the end , that 's just a shitty way of blaming ( potential ) voters for your own failures , which is often exactly the kind of thing that kept them from voting for you in the first place . 
   this is also one of the resulting effects of a small country . 
  there is very little to do ... 
  this will depend a lot on how urbanized and centralized the country is , though . 
  half the population of sweden lives in or near the three biggest cities , while most of the country is uninhabited . 
  so total population and population density numbers do n't really say much . 
  and then threaten to unsubscribe whenever something happens ? 
  yes . 
  they speak quietly , while keeping gestures to a minimum . 
  very asocial overall . 
  and their food is terrible . 
  stealing a little at a time , with each individual theft so small as to go ( almost ) unnoticed . 
  `` good '' is subjective . 
  `` bestseller '' is a defined metric . 
  but what if russian tourists stop coming to finland ? 
  they 'll miss out on tens of euros worth of revenue every year !, 
  surstr\u00f6mming wo n't kill you * instantly * . 
  it 'll be drawn out and painful . 
  they should just call him an artist . 
  that 's what he 's famous for . 
  recognized by no one ever , it should be added . 
  there 's a bunch of lore , though . 
  it 's all rather amusing , and slightly insane . 
   yeah , i have no clue what some sort of german sausage is doing there . 
  all kinds of random sausages are occasionally included . 
  more so the further back in time you look . 
  still , including wei\u00dfwurst but not prinskorv is absurd , though . 
  everyone has prinskorv . 
  maybe 0.1 % have wei\u00dfwurst . 
  they had a parliament all that time , though . 
  no one was formally leading the country , but they did still have an assembly with the power to make law . 
  people who bother to vote usually have some understanding of what the candidates or parties stand for . 
  it 's usually just one choice every four years . 
  some thought goes into it if you bother to go out and vote . 
  but if there 's a referendum on * everything * , there would be multiple political decisions to make every day . 
  few people care enough to put * that * much effort into it . 
  it 's a big place . 
  they 're not all living in huge polluted cities along the coast . 
   now we have the apparently contradictory situation where muslims and gays suport the fn , even though the fn has a history of islamophobic and homophobic tendencies . 
  to be fair , it 's not the first time a party changes its views significantly . 
  the most famous and extreme example is probably the democrats and republicans in the us switching sides on the political spectrum . 
  few would claim that the republicans are * actually * still leftist , and are just pretending to be right wing to attract voters . 
  fn might have genuinely changed their minds , or at least their policies . 
  no brown cabbage ( which is like 50 % sugar ) ? 
  no caviar on the eggs ? 
  no * lutfisk * ? 
  i 'm skeptical of their swedish christmas dinner . 
  the things on it are good ( aside from the wei\u00dfwurst ; you might see it , but rarely ) , but it 's missing stuff . 
  in particular it 's missing sugary stuff . 
  it does n't seem so crazy now . 
  it 's * just * big and high enough . 
   looks like it includes the ferries . 
  i 'm pretty sure the danes really do have a secret bridge across the atlantic that no one has seen or heard about . 
  i think the russians might object to an annexation of kaliningrad and st. petersburg . 
   it 's not really fine to have a dictator at all whether they support you or not . 
  or rather , it 's fine if you do , but do n't call it a democracy just because it serves your interests . 
  or just `` lie by omission , not really true at all '' . 
  nah , it 's just the usual case of taking credit for anything good that happens and blaming the eu for anything bad that happens , then threatening to leave the eu as a solution to the problem , while neglecting to actually do so as it 's a great scapegoat and because you know that it would n't fix anything and would just make you be held accountable in the future . 
   nordic council , benelux ( probably with germany and austria , perhaps sweden ) nonsense . 
  we 'd totally steal germany for the nordic union . 
  the netherlands and the baltic trio can come too . 
  and probably poland ; they 're more culturally similar than they get credit for . 
  but they 'll * totally * do it this time . 
   they 'll buy access to the local healthcare . 
  assuming they can afford it . 
  healthcare is expensive when you 're old . 
  the only reason you can afford it at home is because tax money basically gets averaged out over your lifetime , but if you move away from your home country then that money is pretty much forfeit . 
  but it 's right there in the name . 
  working as originally intended . 
  and that 's not even a joke . 
  they moved it from a spaceship to a dungeon ? 
  does n't seem like an upgrade . 
  that 's also influential , so both work just as well in this case . 
  if she can manage both at the same time then that 's even better . 
  they actually did do exactly that at the beginning of the revolutionary war , so they have some experience in that area . 
  the outcome made sense .

  i hought this was poland https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckf2gjraute, 
  in some extent yes . 
  240 people from 4 milion in germany . 
  on the other hand , how many do become agnostic or ahteist or just do n't care . 
  studies show that while not all muslims are religious , muslim youths are markedly more religious than non-muslim youths . 
  a study comparing turkish muslim youths living in germany and german youth found that the former were more likely to attend religious services regularly ( 35 % versus 14 % ) . 
   the struggle to civilize one of the abrahamic religions was long , brutal and bloody . 
  what a bunch of bullshit . 
  you made christianity ii with bible 2.0 ? 
  no , it 's the same religion . 
  2nd an 3rd generaion of muslims in europe are the same as their neighbours because of education and prosperity . 
  in this video you can see serb positions : http://youtu.be/th_v6al1d84?t=57s scum writer came to bosnia to shoot civilians . 
  exactly . 
  a traffic accident . 
   seriously can you please explain me what is wrong with sweden ? 
  i just ca n't understand as a muslim , why sweden as a country loves us so much . 
  they do n't love muslims , they tolerate muslims better then rest of europe . 
  kaplan is token islamist for swedish government . 
  when they point finger at muslim countries they can always say how accepting they are of muslims with kaplan as example . 
  kaplan is a clown.like most of milj\u00f6partiet . 
  he went to diplomatic visit to turkey after winning the election . 
  he is minister of housing, 
  most of them ended up in other countries . 
  they did n't send them back . 
  just relocated them , most to usa , because you can not send people back to uninhabitable place . 
  sitting at the local bars and drinking coffee at work time is not productive . 
  he should have done the bosnian backflip for her . 
  most of comments here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrwcgg0hvnc, 
  romania and bulgaria should take care of their citizens even if they are other ethnic group . 
  unpopular in the balkans , they are still your citizens . 
  nature is beautiful everywhere . 
  bosnia more so because of variaty in landscape and climate . 
  on the other hand : http://ekocentar-bocacjezero.com/en/safety_net/, 
  thats a lot of filtered bullshit for anyone who want to read between the lines . 
  what you are trying to say is that even the best of muslims are bad and are going to become radicalized . 
  / r/europe /, 
  wierd for a country with so much natural resources and good it sector . 
  someone is pocketing the money . 
  what 's that ? 
  10 meters of fence give or take to enclose whole country ? 
  even benifits for all refugees including those in turkey would be better . 
  schools , food , roof and medical aids only just like people in camps in turkey would get . 
  no visas , no social security . 
  by that definition russian separatists in ukraine are also terrorists . 
  you should bomb those terrorists too . 
  syrian goverment and russia are not fighting activly isis they are figting fsa and al-qaida . 
  wtf chalmers . 
  you copied my reply from worldnews wtf https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5cebvm/serbia_deports_russians_suspected_of_plotting/d9w0ndb/?context=3, 
  international criminal court for war crimes has given a green light for executions . 
  you can kill as many people as you like and most you can get is 9 years in prison if you are on the loser side . 
  why would that be a problem . 
  serbia has russofetish . 
  russia needs someone to make problems for the eu . 
  even if dodik says he hates turkey he is trying to copy erdagon . 
  he was lobbying us http://acbih.org/?p=1916 and when it did n't work out he turned to putin . 
  now it 's not about rs , because losing power would result would make him face court in bosnia over his criminal acts . 
  when he loses power he will run away to russia . 
  great , when bosnia enters eu there will only be slovenia , croatia , serbia , montenegro and macedonia left . 
  his supporters where chanting this is serbia . 
  that happened 4 days ago . 
  it must be all those toll road money you get from passing tourists , unless you started exporting ski jumpers as products . 
  they payed him off to shut up . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_kosovo_referendum,_2012 same shit . 
  next week bosnian serbs make a referendum to give 1 milion $ free to every serb in rs . 
  same result . 
  only reason dodik is not removed is because he is a clown that europe needs . 
  bosniaks vote for sda , a party with muslim standards , wave turkish flags to support erdagon , when turkey is turning into russian ally , let arabs take over some parts of bosnia . 
  sarajevo will never have full control of the country and rs will never separate . 
  worse then china, 
  all croatians work as season workers on highway tolls in the summer . 
  hackerrank is place where jobless programmers go to get some credit for freelancer.com . 
  i would rank us as # 1 . 
  croatia helped create that mess . 
  bosnjaks are too nice to monirties , they should grow thicker skin, 
  in croatia right now for homeland day and i have seen a lot of serbians here too . 
  like you know what mountin is, 
  are they fireing british people from esa ? 
  i got 30 job listings last week from esa . 
  so , this uzbek might have acted on order by kremlin since isis does n't wa n't to have anything with him , and russia is working on creating right wing oposition and destabilizing sweden . 
  i mean nothing will come out of this .

  he is not twisting it . 
  he makes a good point there . 
  today i gained respect for donald trump . 
  it was n't an easy decision . 
  that was n't obviously written by putin . 
  ju\u017enoslovenski or south slavic . 
  not yugoslavian, 
  he is promoting to the rich hypocrits who would rather live in a peacfull all white neighbourhood then any where else . 
  it 's would boost rentning prices since more people would like to live there . 
  do n't tell me what to do . 
  i read everyones comments and they do not bother me . 
  no you are repeating serbian national propaganda where no great damage was done to the military .

his comment was not radical in any way , whatever his opinions may be , and refering to `` nationalis socialists '' was not warranted . 
  whoa . 
  i always thought it was the beatles, 
   instead of supporting deranged national socialists whoa slow down there . 
  are you trying to make a point , or are you trying to derail ? 
  edit : \\  thought it was beatles \\  is clown, 
  i think it may be the exact moment of impact, 
  it 's a great song !,

  the age-thing is only because they try to make it political, 
  [ in this thread ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axu8w336ogs ), 
  so many redditors believe for some reason that they are the inventors of truth and logic . 
  well i mean us stockholmers do understand some of it , but we usually have to lean forward three times each sentence with a confused look on our faces and say `` va ? '' . 
  it 's a pain speaking to danish people .

  i hear they sparkle and are great at sex, 
  if that was the case there would n't have been a conviction at all, 
  no , op is presenting straight facts that are pretty easy to interpret . 
  and being behind only scandinavia and luxembourg in per capita is pretty good . 
  the fact that you argue this ( that everybody already understands btw ) with a capitalised `` lmao '' to emphasize your enthusiasm over having found something to contradict the article with , just makes you seem a bit slow . 
   where are all the `` oh these people are educated and we should be taking in as many as we can '' fellas who usually inhabit these immigration threads now ?

  pm me if you 're ever in sweden with cheap booze, 
  what, 
  i 've never heard of the guy . 
  what has he done that is treason ? 
  yes , let 's murder 150 million people / s, 
  let 's not go to russia . 
  well from my perspective * the belorussians * are evil !, 
  \\  be u \\  looks at map \\  concludes russians are asians mfw logic, 
  kek 'd but seriously thought , has there been any critizism like that ? 
  i mean it 's russia that banned the food imports in the first place , so why would the eu care if serbia sold them fruit ? 
  especially since serbia is n't in the eu . 
  it would n't be crazy to think that falling oil prices could give room for other sectors to grow , but i think reluctance to invest in russia diminishes the possibility of that happening . 
  can we assume that : 15 gets pregnant and is afraid to tell her family about it and she does n't know where to turn to get help . 
  her much older boyfriend ( who is an al-qaida fanboy ) easily persuades the girl that they can go live with al-qaida as husband and wife . 
  the end . 
  whenever somebody links to dailymail on reddit , a british redditor inevitably shows up and points out that it 's a shitty paper that will print anything . 
  the article made it seem like he was ousted because of corruption . 
  i can never make up my mind about foreignpolicy as a news outlet . 
  that assumption is a great way to isolate the real world from ones perception of it . 
  the eu is n't much for protectionism . 
  i think poland is big stronk enough that other countries would be inclined to invest in fighting russia there tbh . 
  i was gon na say that even * sweden * has increased defense spending this last year but then i recalled some bullshit parliament crap about the budget so ^ never ^ ^ mind ^ ^ ^ that, 
  that 's why you rinse . 
  that does sound like a stupid gang you do n't wan na hang with . 
  but could it have been * bad * propaganda that you saw ? 
  i had no idea there was active fighting going on about this, 
  these are two examples of incidents where [ swiss ] ( http://www.rt.com/news/swiss-fighters-office-hours-514/ ) and [ swedish ] ( http://archive.defensenews.com/article/20130502/defreg/304290022/russian-attack-raises-questions-over-sweden-s-readiness ) jets were not scrambled because the airforce does n't have 24/7 readiness at all . 
  now i know neither of these countries are both nato and eu members , and that these embarresments have caused atleast sweden to keep at least some 24/7 readiness , but it does show that not all fighters are kept ready to scramble immediatly at all times . 
  i 'd guess that most fighters are only on alert if there is a very serious risk of a war breaking out . 
  okay i would never have guessed . 
  but i still do n't think 1000 aircraft could be scrambeled to the baltic that quickly even just after lunch on a tuesday . 
  i seriously doubt that number . 
  do you have a source ? 
  it means the rouble has lost value and now you have to pay more of it for the same result . 
  it 's more expensive for the average russian to bribe them , but do n't worry , we can still buy the future of russia with our evil western money at roughly the same cost / s edit : and by that i mean that russian bribe-prizes seem to not be tied to the russian currency, 
  wow i did n't remember that scene being so terrible, 
  i did n't know that . 
  it 's very interesting . 
  do they make executive cars like the mercedes c-class and such ? 
  more like a generic non-democracy imo . 
  what makes it facist ? 
  it 's not like you ca n't quit your job or stuff . 
  this is amazing, 
  you must have brain damage .

he was a marshal under napoleon and was selected as sweden lacked a suitable heir for the throne .

  [ cornelis vreeswijk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cornelis_vreeswijk ) , a [ singer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwhxsqol_v0 ) who was born in the netherlands . 
  [ jean-baptiste bernadotte ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_xiv_john_of_sweden ) , was born in france and later became the king of sweden . 
  he was the founder of the current royal dynasty in sweden . 
  hurrah , thank you . 
  how does one get a flair ? 
  yea , except those . 
  what i mean is that you can move around in roseng\u00e5rd and feel pretty damn safe , it is neither compton nor mogadishu . 
  that is not to say there are not any issues , ofc . 
  edit : claim that malm\u00f6 is not mogadishu , get down voted . 
  what a beautiful life . . 
  to be honest , to say that sweden has a `` ghetto problem '' is somewhat incorrect . 
  from personal experience , areas such as roseng\u00e5rd are not some lawless , urban , extremely unsafe and violent wasteland as many people who have not been there seem to believe . 
  sure . 
  `` the stick '' might not be very effective , its still pretty huge though . 
  of course , economic influence is what is relevant . 
  they do have a fairly massive army though . 
  i did n't intend to make any serious comment or accusation or anything , i just found it slightly amusing . 
  you misanthropic piece of shit . 
  it 's far from `` everyone '' though . 
  even with the more popular anti-immigration parties they are at best a sizable minority in most western european countries , to my knowledge . 
  you say that as if you are certain about it . 
  within what time frame will islamist political parties gain 40 % of the popular vote across europe ? 
  s is quite a bit bigger in most polls . 
  m was bigger in the latest one i saw . 
  in terms of seats in parliament both s and m are bigger . 
  i just found it a bit amusing that someone with an estonian flag would be advocating `` big stick '' policies , considering the 20th century history of estonia . 
  would the money spend on the refugees in europe not provide a higher `` humanitarian value '' in those over crowded camps ? 
  common sense is for commoners . 
  is the fundamental issue here not that countries such as the uk have a fundamentally different vision on what immigration policies are sensible than for example sweden and germany , and that they have no illusion of a federal policy being used to `` force '' them to accept policies which they do not wish for ? 
  whenever people around me talk about `` a federal policy '' they always do it with an assumption that it would mirror the policies of sweden or be the policies which they wish for . 
  i do n't think many of them would accept a federal policy which drastically differed from either the current swedish policies or their ideal one . 
  `` we '' being estonia ? 
  that is my guess . 
  but hey , the benefit of the doubt and all that ? 
  please ? 
  do you have a reputable source for `` most of them '' claiming a false nationality ? 
  you take that back !, 
  you do know that malm\u00f6 is a pretty decent place , right ? 
  is humanity suffering from a lack of fertile uteruses ? 
  the right to asylum is not based upon some form of `` value in attempts at population growth '' , it is an universal right . 
  in the modern world the notion of men having lesser rights to protection , or their suffering being less relevant simply because they happen have a dick between their legs is simply sexist . 
  why combine adult women with children , as though they had some form of special right to safety or protection solely because of their sex ? 
  how cute , do you have anything other than bitterness and personal attacks ? 
  are you serious ? 
  you childishly wish for war and poverty on other people , and then try to portray yourself as some paragon of the man on the street . 
  piss off !, 
  take a look at real income changes across income levels . 
  take a look at child mortality rates . 
  take a look at malnutrition rates . 
  take a look at the prevalence of easily curable diseases . 
  take a look at almost any measurement of quality of life or poverty . 
  it 's not `` a vice article '' which says that the worlds poor is better of . 
  even if demographic changes and political decisions mean that you will have a less lavish pension than current pensioneers , its silly to blame them for being too many , living too long or for political decisions they do not hold a larger say over then you do . 
   fuck them . 
  i 'll never get to retire , why the fuck should i care if they do ? 
   your life experience of the world is n't everyone elses . 
   narcissism . 
   arrogant once more , it is you who wish violence and poverty on other people out of a sense of entitlement . 
  read my comment again . 
  mankind is now near universally better off than it has ever been . 
  it is true on a global scale and across all levels of income . 
  the worlds poor has seen the most significant changes , and hunger and easilly preventable disease is becoming less prevalent than ever before . 
  by what measurement is the world poorer now then it has been before ? 
   we should give them [ ... ] war [ ... ] debt , poverty  fuck old people . 
   narcissism . 
  take a look in the goddamn mirror .

  bitches about the people who made it possible fucking him over . 
  what about france ? 
  people sooner or later become hungry and grow the fuck up . 
  common sense is for commoners . 
  im not arguing that it is not an important issue , but when 1/5 of the comments on a silly picture is `` immigrants , amirite ? '', 
  its hard to call it anything but shoehorning in immigration . 
  you should see the / r/sweden discussions . 
  aint nothing not connected to immigration . 
  [ drottningholmsmusiken ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k9rzix8btjy ) , it was written for the marriage of future king adolf frederik who later ate himself to death . 
  yes , if you are willing to pay for it in time and money , you can get some of the `` scary '' stuff . 
  but when it comes to the right to use them for self-defense i 've only heard about the czech being somewhat similar to the americans . 
  the types of firearms and the right to use them is severely restricted in many places , however . 
  talking to people is hard , ok ? 
  to be fair , if if they are going to do it i think italy is the country they would be the safest to do so with . 
  sorry , i did not mean to put words in your mouth . 
  i do not know how it works for the countries with first pass the post systems when they vote for their eump : s , i must admit . 
  the us voting system definately has questionable effects on its political climate . 
  but we can not look past the influence of regional favoritism , the apathy of the populance , aggressive lobbying , racial tensions and the distance between decision makers and the electorate . 
  i have a hard time seeing how similar issues would be avoided by a europe with 24 official languages and even more socially diverse nations . 
  regardless of the impact of the voting system the participation in eu parliment election was around 42 % of eligble voters , if i remember correctly . 
  i am sceptical of the prospect of giving more powers to a representative body which frankly mostly represents the electorates apathy towards it , in the hope that people will feel forced to take part in its process by the power it has over their lives . 
  it seems like a recipe for a dysfunctional institution and a political climate defined by cynicism , apathy , anger and conflict . 
  what makes you think that a european federation and its political scene would be much less dysfunctional than what we see in the united states ? 
  it is not black and white . 
  politicians consistently show themselves to be incapable of handling perverse incentives which they subject themselves to , and the electorate consistently fails to punish destructive populism . 
  it is not to hard to at least understand why the idea of technocrat control over for example monetary policy or pension system seems promising , much like we already accept non-elected courts or military leadership . 
  my point was entirely directed at the us two party system .

  outside stockholm , but still doable , you will find the following : * [ flygvapenmuseum ] ( http://www.flygvapenmuseum.se//en ) - the air force museum , located in link\u00f6ping . 
  * [ marinmuseum ] ( https://www.marinmuseum.se/en ) - the naval museum , located in karlskrona . 
  * [ arsenalen ] ( http://arsenalen.se/en/ ) - a museum with loads of military vehicles . 
  one nice thing is that all , except arsenalen and the vasa museum , are free of charge . 
  shakira laws , no-go zones , swedistan etc etc, 
  my biggest problem with the american tipping culture is it really being a hidden charge you more or less have to pay . 
  it also makes the servers overly friendly . 
  i 'm at the restaurant to enjoy the food and the company of my family/friends , not to become friends with the server . 
  and lastly , because the servers get more tips the more guests they serve you could feel rushed . 
  a dinner at a restaurant should be allowed to take it 's time , the food does n't need to arrive within 10 minuets etc. 
  in addition dental care is free until the year you turn 19 . 
  after that you get a `` dental care allowance '' every year that is either 150 or 300 sek , you can save the money one year . 
  there is also a `` high cost protection '' . 
  you pay everything up to 3000 sek by yourself , for sums between 3000 and 15 000 you pay 50 % and above 15 000 you only pay 15 % . 
  most watched tv-program last year was the finale of * melodifestivalen * , the swedish competition before eurovision . 
  second was * donald duck and his friends celebrate christmas * then it was [ * p\u00e5 sp\u00e5ret * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p\u00e5_sp\u00e5ret ), 
  fun fact , `` fitta '' originally meant `` v\u00e5tmark '' ( wetland ) other fun names : fjuckby sn\u00e5lkuk ( cheap dick ), 
  not like those cereals . 
  most cereals we have for breakfast are whole grain with very little added sugar , berries are a common add-on . 
  though i would wager that most people here in sweden have m\u00fcsli with yoghurt or [ filmj\u00f6lk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/filmj\u00f6lk ) instead . 
  or porridge . 
  yes , we also have those small stores together with the petrol station . 
  the thing that stood out was when you could buy 3l bag in box vodka at an autobahn service center . 
  if alcohol was as cheap and easy to get hold of in sweden as it is in most other parts of europe i 'm sure that sweden would look a lot more like russia ... 
  being able to buy booze at a petrol station was one of the biggest culture shocks for me when road tripping in europe . 
  the act of succession is probably the most weird , since many parts stay unchanged from 1810 , when it was written .

  and then you would get off the bus at the next stop , even if it is n't yours . 
  changing seat is n't an option as that just escalate the weirdness . 
  that made me feel very uncomfortable . . 
  except all those values in the graph for eu is totally wrong . 
  it should go like this : * nox : 0.080 for diesel and 0.060 for petrol . 
  in the graph it 's listed as 0.4 * pm : 0.005 for both diesel and petrol . 
  in the grap it 's listed as 0.04 , notice the extra zero in the real standards . 
  * co : 0.5 for diesel and 1.0 for petrol . 
  co2 is n't even part of the emission standards , but the more co2 a car let out , the more it 's taxed . 
  since the swedish constitution really is four fundamental laws a `` last article '' as such does n't really makes any sense . 
  but the last paragraph of the fourth fundamental law , `` the fundamental law on freedom of expression '' states the following : `` chapter 11 . 
  general provisions art . 
  the provisions laid down in chapter 14 , articles 1 to 3 of the freedom of the press act concerning the re-opening of closed cases , examination of freedom of the press cases before a higher instance and prompt handling of such cases shall apply also in respect of corresponding cases under this fundamental law . 
  provisions laid down in an act of law or other statute apply in all respects not specially regulated in this fundamental law or in an act of law adopted by virtue of this fundamental law . 
  foreign nationals are equated with swedish citizens in respect of freedom of expression under this fundamental law unless otherwise provided in law . '', 
  makes absolutely no sense whatsoever on it 's own . . 
  checked for myself , 70cl absolut vodka is 315 nok = 337 sek ... that 's 35 euros . . edit : and a 33cl can of carlsberg ( 5 % abv ) is 30 nok ( 3,30 euros ) that 's about 2,7 times more expensive than sweden , which is expensive to start with ... 
  this question is very very complex . 
  but the main reason why diesels are n't common in passenger cars in the u.s is simply because the demand is low . 
  there is however possible to buy diesels from some manufacturers , like for instance bmw . 
  now , the actual emission standards are not necessarily better or worse . 
  they are * different * , as in some values might be higher , while others are lower . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but the big pick-up trucks have a different legislation than normal passenger cars , right ? 
  we have all seen the clips of americans `` rolling coal '' ... 
  there are many reasons to why you can not import a car to the u.s. 
  the actual emission values play a very small part in that . 
  taxes . 
  yes , even more so . 
  a domestic ( piss ) beer on the tap will set you back about 6 euros for 40-45cl . 
  a 33cl bottle of heiniken could also cost 6 euros . 
  a drink ( with 5-6cl of alcohol ) is anything between 12,50 euros and 18,50 euros depending on where you are . 
  student pubs are cheaper , but then you need to be a student of course . . 
  700ml of absolut vodka 40 % abv is 239kr ( $ 24,80 $ 27,80 ) the cheap stuff is generally more expensive ( relatively ) than the better stuff . 
  reason for this is that systembolaget ( the state owned store that sells alcohol above 3,5 % abv ) only adds 6 % on the price they pay the maker . 
  the rest is taxes , which depend on the amount of alcohol . 
  edit : the alcohol tax on distilled alcohol ( different taxation on beer , wines and ciders ) is 511,48 kr per liter 100 % abv ( $ 59,40 ) . 
  so on the bottle of absolut the alcohol tax is 0,4 x 0,7 x 511,48 = 143,2 kr , or $ 16,6 . 
  then there 's vat added to that , which is 25 % . 
  which means that the alcohol tax stands for 179kr ( $ 20,8 ) of the 239kr . 
  * br\u00e4nnvin special * 350ml 30 % abv , 98kr ( $ 10,20 $ 11,40 ) * dworek vodka * 700ml 37,5 % abv , 193kr ( $ 20 $ 22,40 ) alcohol is expensive here . . 
  waste of money . 
  sk\u00e5ne is always a popular bet to this question . 
  although i would wager that the dialect spoken on gotland and the one spoken close to the norwegian border in j\u00e4mtland is even harder to understand . 
  hawaii is a bit special though , it 's an island that 's really really far away . 
  but if we 're talking about mainland us it 's mostly same same . 
  most of the differences are the ones that exist everywhere between rural and urban settings . 
  i would argue that there are a lot more differences between sweden and denmark than there is between the vast majority of us states . 
  and even then sweden and denmark are n't that different . 
  * \u00a7 1 all public power in sweden proceeds from the people . 
  * * the swedish democracy is founded on freedom of opinion and universal and equal suffrage . 
  it is realized through a representative and parliamentary polity and through local self-government . 
  * * the public power is exercised through the law . 
  * this is the first paragraph in the first chapter of * regeringsformen * one of four fundamental laws of sweden . 
  * regeringsformen * alone consists of 15 chapters with 8-25 paragraphs each , so it 's a pretty big document to say the least . 
  [ v\u00e4sterbottenost ] ( http://vasterbottensost.com/en/ ) a hard cheese with a quite strong flavour , can be enjoyed on a sandwich , in a pie or just as it is . 
  maybe among professionals , but the average swede still says l/mil . 
  or maybe it 's just me and the ones i know that are backwards . 
  mil is anyhow an official measurement , see `` milers\u00e4ttning '' . 
  i just realised that we are pretty weird regarding this here in sweden . 
  in recipes we use litres , decilitres , tablespoons ( = 15ml ) , teaspoons ( = 5ml ) and `` spice measure '' ( = 1ml ) . 
  for weights we mostly use grams , but kilograms can be used as well . 
  some things are bought per hectogram in the store . 
  another weird thing we do is using `` miles '' . 
  but not the imperial one , we use the `` scandinavian mile '' which equals to 10 km . 
  we measure fuel consumption in l/mile . 
  when casually talking about longer distances we speak about miles . 
  this can lead to confusion when speaking to foreigners . 
  it very much depends on where in europe you are going . 
  most countries have a national rail service that run on the major trunk lines . 
  some cross into other countries as well . 
  but as a general rule : if you want to go somewhere by train , there is only one operator .

  contrary , other benefits lead smaller countries to join in larger unions . 
   no one said anything about america being better . 
  indeed , you simply go out of your way to make up reasons for why other countries would be bad . 
  this is what i talked about , americans just ca n't stop making up ridiculous reasons for why they are better than others . 
   i would then you 're simply wrong . 
  you define poor in the only way that will suit your argument . 
  that does not make you more correct . 
  turkmenistan would be the richest country on earth 2014 by your definition , a position afghanistan recently had . 
  japan has one of the highest standards of living , and is not in any reasonable way defined as poor . 
  well said . 
  there may be benefits , but there are also difficulties in being a small country . 
  you can often gain part of the upsides of both by having different levels of local and national governance , this is well known . 
  the argument i object to is people saying that it 's somehow less significant or irrelevant if a smaller country preforms well . 
  it 's right up there with the people claiming that sweden is only successful because of that we 're `` more homogeneous '' , something that is n't even true as of late . 
   excuse for what ? 
  for sometimes having horrible results in matters such as those mentioned . 
   but yes , besides the united states we do n't have a country that is very large and does n't have a large number of people living in poverty . 
  so your believe breaking up counties in to smaller ones will lower or even eliminate poverty ? 
  how would you explain poor countries that are small ? 
  how would you explain historical times when the worlds largest empires have also often been the worlds richest ? 
  ( i could give you examples if you f ), 
  do you argue it 's easier being a small country ? 
  would large countries be better of splitting into smaller ones ? 
  i hear the `` size '' excuse often , mostly from americans , but i doubt there is much truth to it . 
   ( only stock holders would be poorer , but that 's the risk of being a stock holder ) not even that . 
  the demanded return on investment would not be affected and therefore remain the same . 
  prices and margins would adjust to meet this . 
  prices in the end would be higher to carry the cost . 
  there sadly is n't any way to provide income to the state without someone having to pay . 
  the positive effect in this case though would be making a more equal playing field where local and international companies pay the same taxes . 
  the current situation does not provide a good free market competition , since global companies pay lower taxes on profit . 
  so there were two of them . 
  did n't know the story . 
  no , most of them were n't even swedish citizens . 
  and this is the day . 
  the joke is that norwegians are stupid , not that they are poor . 
  besides , the jokes are at least a hundred years old and it 's just kids having fun without minding the modern geopolitical situation . 
  q : why do the norwegians leave the door open when they go to the toilet ? 
  a : because they do n't want anyone to peek through the key hole . 
  q : why do the norwegians crawl on the floor through the supermarket ? 
  a : because they 're looking for the low prices . 
  in other words , a minority government is allowed . 
  brown bears and wolves are hunted yearly by government ordinated quota in sweden . 
  although we have a lot of forest . 
  letting them overpopulate and starve can be quite dangerous . 
  i think he 's joking . 
  computer parts are mainly produced in the us , taiwan and south korea . 
  of these countries i 'd say the us has most relaxed environmental protection . 
  you will tend to go as much downwards as upwards in the long run , 
  the explanation is that he was sentenced for groping adult girls on one occasion . 
  one months suspended sentence and compensation of 1000 $ per girl is rather mild , but in sweden 's defence i doubt many countries would have convicted him at all . 
  yes , to a smaller extent . 
  two interesting articles : http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2016/03/criminal-justice http://www.businessinsider.com/report-says-long-sentences-dont-deter-crime-2014-5?r=us&amp;ir=t&amp;ir=t it 's quite well agreed upon . 
  but another interesting effect is how longer sentences in some cases make re-offence more common , if you do n't lock them up indefinitely . 
  the prohibitive effect actually does n't correlate as much as you 'd expect with the harshness of the punishment . 
  it 's not be chance the nordics ended up with such short prison sentences , we 're very much based on scientific fact , contrary to the ones advocating the emotional revenge . 
   and the chance risk, 
  the prohibitive effect is also very relevant . 
  do you think imprisoning them for a longer time will have a difference on something ? 
  i 'd need for it to be in stockholm , since that 's where i work . 
  i would n't even be able rent an tiny apartment for 410 $ . 
  this is decent punishment in finland . 
  they did n't get off easy . 
  it being legal or illegal does effect society , and thereby every inhabitant . 
  that 's why we legislate . 
  we would n't , and should n't , care if it only was a private matter . 
  many german poles have lived there for generations and are of polish decent . 
  it 's not the top `` destination '' for poles , since that would imply that they were born in poland . 
  kurdish is not included in the chart , since it 's not spoken in europe . 
  thank you for the insight . 
  a minimum wage is often too broad , it might be better for the wage to differ by region and type of job , but this is unpopular in many countries . 
  in sweden , and till recently germany , the minimum wage is set as an agreement between the employers and the labour unions of the industries in question . 
  the national minimum wage is more popular in europe though . 
  taxing new cars heavily is usually to afford the huge investments in infrastructure needed to handle the growth in car use . 
  there is no use in having cheap cars if the country have n't afforded to build the roads for them yet . 
  in countries where the growth in car use has stagnated , the fuel tax usually pays for the upkeep of the already existing infrastructure . 
  then we have norway who taxes both heavily because they do n't like petrol cars . 
  it obviously should increase as the average wage increases , but just from knowing that it today is at 300 euros you ca n't know that this is too low for romania . 
  it could even be too high and causing high levels of unemployment , thereby furthering poverty , for all we know if this is all we go by . 
  populism should not be the driving factor in setting the level of minimum wage . 
  economists are fully capable of weighing all the effects and adjusting the wage properly . 
  the governments should have , and probably do have , good economic advisors capable of this . 
  a higher minimum wage would n't do shit for the rural poor . 
  it 's not like they are employed at factories or something . 
  they rather need to urbanise and employ more people in new industries and services . 
  this will take time and require functioning education . 
  you ca n't solve poverty by rising the wages , it kind of redistributes wealth in already wealthy countries , but this is not the situation for romania at all . 
  you socialists have already done enough damage to eastern europe , just give it up already . 
  '' / s '' is the sign for sarcasm .

  i think most swedes have heard more british english than the average american . 
  we are mostly taught british english in school , and we very much prefer british comedy to american . 
  do you also call it a petrol station instead of gas station ? 
  most of my english is probably american , since tv and literature from there is the biggest source . 
  oh , ice stands for internal combustion engine . 
  now it makes more sense , thought it was something about taxes . 
  my english is quite lacking when it comes to technical stuff .

  no one cares about turkey except for now when we have to because you 're electing a madman .

  really does n't seem like it here . 
  typical, 
  cry, 
  boohoo , my imperialism . 
  cry me a fucking river . 
  way to miss my point . 
  the swords and heads are referring to the ottoman empire and their fight against it , why are turks so offended by the fact people fought them off after they enslaved them for hundreds of years ? 
  there 's probably a lot of similar remnants from the time periods you mentioned which i could n't give a shit about because they obviously symbolize their resistance against the swedes . 
  turks need to stop mourning their empire that relied on the suffering on others , thanks . 
  post did n't get 100 % upvotes ? 
  wow now i 'm really offended, 
   turks ' heads on swords ? 
  who thought hundreds of years of occupation would result in `` offensive '' illustrations like that . 
  as if it is n't already with what 's going on in turkey and the fact that it 's a russian ambassador . 
  no idea what you 're trying to say , his question was who gets them mixed up and the balkans was my answer .

   czechs . 
  they pronounce it `` sheks '' actually . 
  finland got attacked though lol , it 's not like they willingly went to battle with the ussr . 
  again , sweden probably made the right choice . 
  easier said than done . 
  monkey mentality to think fighting has to be the best choice . 
  not sure if sarcastic , but my point is that sweden was so powerless that the [ germans would have access to whichever swedish resources they wanted , by the use force or without it . 
  ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/fe/5b/d6/fe5bd60af9296339b79757a09fad6821.jpg ) the way sweden played it out made it possible to defend the targeted populace within the country . 
  in case you did n't know , norwegian and danish jews were fleeing occupation and coming to sweden , so sweden had a fair bit of jews within the country . 
  yes , because discontinuing trade sure would have made things better , especially for the jews taking refuge in sweden , 
   wait , so infibulation is circumcision but subincision is not . 
  do you know what circumcision means ? 
  it means to cut around ; the world only applies technically to one procedure ; the destruction of the male prepuce and frenulum . 
  `` female '' circumcision , is not only a misnomer the word itself has no precise clinical meaning aside form one . 
  now that 's just straight up untrue lol sad  this objection is one of the most ridiculous i 've ever heard , not only for being outright wrong but because of . 
  it 's desperate attempts to move the goalposts . 
  i 've provided you with all the arguments but you 're obviously just being a retarded contrarian . 
  who and most governments do n't have anything on / u/eryemil . 
  grow up, 
   subincision is a form of mgm . 
   infibulation is a form of fgm . 
   we 're comparing all types of male genital mutilation against all kinds of female genital mutilation ; not just the ones that are convenient for your argument . 
  last time i checked this post is about circumcision and the comment we 're responding to is about the legal status of circumcision in males and females  subincision does not count as circumcision , while the different types of fgm do . 
   if we were n't , we 'd have to compare the destruction of the prepuce and frenulum against the destruction of the clitoral hood . 
  that would n't serve your argument either . 
  again , wrong , you 're talking so much shit because you 're willfully ignorant . 
  do you have any statistics that show how common the fgm types are ? 
  no , you have n't provided a single one . 
  the who says 10 % of circumcised women have gone through stage 3 aka infibulation and the other 90 % have gone through stage 1 or stage 2 , which are defined as partial or total removal of the clitoris for stage 1 and for stage 2 , it 's the same thing as infibulation sans the sewing . 
  they also clearly state that the removal of the clitoral hood only is a very ** uncommon practice ** since you 're being an annoying contrarian moron and love ignoring facts , i 've decided to paste the definitions below . 
  * type 1 : often referred to as clitoridectomy , this is the partial or total removal of the clitoris ( a small , sensitive and erectile part of the female genitals ) , ** and in very rare cases , only the prepuce ** ( the fold of skin surrounding the clitoris ) . 
  * type 2 : often referred to as excision , this is the partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora ( the inner folds of the vulva ) , with or without excision of the labia majora ( the outer folds of skin of the vulva ) . 
  * type 3 : often referred to as infibulation , this is the narrowing of the vaginal opening through the creation of a covering seal . 
  the seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the labia minora , or labia majora , sometimes through stitching , with or without removal of the clitoris ( clitoridectomy ) . 
  i hope you 're kidding . 
  moroccans = salafists amirite xd, 
   what 's your point here , exactly ? 
  infibulation is a type of genital mutilation ; so is pricking the clitoris with a needle to draw a drop of blood . 
  obviously not , there are different types of fgm and infibulation is one of them . 
   the argument at hand is about your claim that fgm is somehow `` worse and different '' than mgm . 
  cutting off someone 's glans or even more of the penis does not count as mgm , while higher stages of fgm like infibulation do count as fgm , so yes , it 's worse . 
   so far you 've failed to form a coherent argument as to why fgm is worse . 
  not really , you 're just ignoring everything i 've saying and pretending that fgm is not an umbrella term comprised of more plentiful and dangerous procedures than mgm , which is very defined . 
   if you cite infibulation , i can just say `` subincision '' . 
  if you say , well , subincision is rare , all i have to say is that so is fgm as a whole , compared to mgm . 
  you 've got no grounds . 
  subincision = / = circumcision infibulation = circumcision murder is less more common than robbery . 
  how does it matter ? 
   `` does exist '' does not equal it being the most prevalent form . 
  less invasive procedures are also practised in countries where infibulation is the norm -- they 're just less common . 
  let me quote you :  so , they do n't practise fgm at all in indonesia then ? 
  you implied infibulation does not happen in indonesia , 
  there 's 8 million women who have gone through infibulation ( 10 % of circumsized women ) worldwide , which is problematic since it 's counted as a fgm type , meaning as long as fgm is not outlawed , infibulation most likely wo n't be either . 
  type 1 and type 2 fgm make up 90 % of cases and type 2 is essentially type 3 ( infibulation ) sans the sewing part . 
   female genital mutilation type i and iv is prevalent in indonesia . 
  judging by wiki , infibulation ** does ** exist in indonesia . 
   procedures differ according to the country or ethnic group . 
  they include removal of the clitoral hood and clitoral glans ; removal of the inner labia ; and removal of the inner and outer labia and closure of the vulva . 
  in this last procedure ( known as infibulation ) , a small hole is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid ; the vagina is opened for intercourse and opened further for childbirth . 
  because typically males have their foreskins cut off , while females have a lot bigger procedures , cutting all of the clitoris , the outer parts ( equivalent of male 's glans ) and then they sew their vaginas shut with a tiny hole for pissing/menstruation . 
  if someone discovers the stitches have been torn/opened it 's a sign of premarital sex and they very often get killed in the name of honor . 
  yes they are .

  meat is the most expensive thing on my plate , but also what contributes the most to my weight . 
  not that i 'm fat , i 'd also like it to remain that way . 
  well , i assume there 's a ton of variables involved . 
  but imagine a local countryside store . 
  they order x kiloes of beef , they keep track of x kiloes of beef sold . 
  if a lot of it ends up unsold before the expiry date and this trends keeps up , they 'll likely order less meat next time . 
  or they 'll just slap an ` eat soon , expiration date near ' sticker on it and sell it at a discount . 
  if it 's just me doing it , sure . 
  if more people started doing the same it would start having an effect, 
  daily meat is n't a problem . 
  total meat consumption is . 
  i think the last one was quite clever . 
  it 's not meat is bad . 
  it 's too much meat is bad . 
  beef and meat that comes from ruminating animals is the main problem as their digestive process produces large quantities of methane and methane is roughly 20x as potent for greenhouse effect purpuses as co2 is . 
  chicken , fish and pork for instance are n't near as bad . 
  you do n't have to go full vegetarian , just changing your eating habits to include less beef will help out . 
  but i agree that we tend to eat too much meat . 
  i 'm guilty of the same .

  immigration = contributes to housing shortage . 
  then some girl called me racist for it and got really upset about it and me and a friend . 
  i suspect she had n't really been listening and just snapped up the `` immigration is bad '' bit . 
  it 's a bit of a heated subject , so tempers tend to run high when opposing sides argue . 
  she argumed that was that i was merely seeking an excuse to use against immigration as a way to mask my dislike of brown people . 
  i was n't really sure how to refute her claim but i 'm highly doubtful there was anything i could say to convince her otherwise either . 
  she had made up her mind the moment i brought up immigration in a negative context . 
  i think most swedes are pro-immigration as a whole , but i also think that most swedes think we 've taken in more than we can handle and i am certain that most swedes are displeased with how the goverment has been handling this crisis seeing how quickly they turned around . 
  they 've been very slow to react and most think they 've been brushing the problem under the carpet so they can look good and charitable . 
  like , i 'd gladly accept any immigrant who 's willing to adapt to life in sweden and able to find a job within a reasonable amount of time . 
  if that number is 500 , 5 000 , 50 000 a year or whatever - that 's fine . 
  if they can find jobs and contribute to society than they 're more than welcome . 
  problem lies in that we 've for years have been taking in a lot more people than we 've been able to integrate into society and now we 've got a backlog of asylum cases , thousands of people who ca n't get work permits and from this mass , a growing sentiment of displeasure has been forming . 
  kids who do n't bother with school because they figure they 're never going to get a job anyway , parents who ca n't get work permits because the backlog of asylum cases ... thousands of people trapped in the limbo of buerocracy . 
  impatient . 
  bored . 
  restless . 
  naturally that 's a recipe for trouble . 
  we 've got thousands of immigrants and refugees in storage out in the suburbs not even given a chance . 
  we ca n't handle this many and i think it 's absurd that we 've kept taking in more even after the migration department first started shouting that they could n't keep up .

are also gaining power when the third ( judicial ) and fourth ( media ) power do not work properly . 
  i agree but for almost the complete opposite situation here . 
  the judicial branch here is extremely cuddly with even very hardcore repeat criminals because of the mantra of rehabilitation being chanted unopposed since the 70s and the media is almost exclusively in the hands of our most extreme leftists/open-the-borders types with roughly 70 % voting for them . 
  ( there have been studies showing they give them far more favourable coverage ) our far right has won a lot by being the only party for more severe sentencing of highly violent crimes and by the very blatant , sometimes to the point of publicly embarrasing themselves , bias of our media . 
  the vast majority of the recent right-wing in europe is neither revolutionary nor anti-democratic in nature . 
  the closest thing you 'll see to them fighting is opposing the eu and current immigration laws . 
  that 's an nsf meeting from a person who later joined sd and became the local delegate in h\u00f6\u00f6r and was kicked out when it came to light . 
  here 's an [ actual sweden democrat meeting from 1996 . 
  skarion 's easily the most dishonest swedditor ever when it comes to statistics , he regularly reposts lies about our immigration costs using the same oecd report despite being called out on it pretty much every time , so i would take anything he says with a massive shaker of salt . 
  the former report he 's citing is from over 5 years ago for example and has long been invalidated by the massive increase in votes for sd among city-dwellers , business owners and academics . 
  as for immigrant sd voters they 're primarily from the older generation , yugoslavs and chileans who came in the 80s and 90s , and they were from what i recall of 2014 polls hovering at around 8 % . 
   not just `` subcultural far-right '' , they 're directly rooted in neo-nazi groups . 
  not really , they had members that had a history in those groupings ( first economist and second party lead for instance ) but the party itself came out of anti-immigration activist movements of varying political alignment like framstegspartiet ( populist anti-immigration ) , the old sverigepartiet ( populists and early sd ) and the more ethnonationalist and often racist grassroots of bss . 
   they still had members wearing nazi uniforms at rallies . 
  they had issues with skinheads and bomber jackets at rallies , not nazi uniforms . 
  that was one case of one local representative back in ' 94 , not at one of their rallies , and was the reason why they instituted a universal uniform ban including the bomber jackets crowd as well . 
   is it the same in part of europe ? 
  it was in sweden for the last few years ( early 90s to about 2010 imo ) when the media and major parties collaborated to , as the media heads put it , `` keep the lid on '' . 
  nowadays the sweden democrats have grown too immensely from their opponent 's absolute failure of handling of the subject for them to keep trying that nonsense . 
  they 're at the point where they 'll probably be the largest party in an election or two . 
   unification , cooperation and standardisation creates peace and social progress and economic prosperity . 
  like in yugoslavia ? 
  and here i mistakenly believed it brought civil war based along ethnic lines . 
   nationalism will have the opposite effect . 
  yeah , i mean just look at per albin-hansson , tage erlander or other nationalistic social democrats . 
  truly they brought nothing but war , social regression and economic deterioration to sweden . 
   why are swedish redditors right leaning ( relatively ) ? 
  last polling i recall had something like 60 % being against our current immigration policy . 
  that 's by no means a left and right issue even if those who are pro-mass immigration like to pretend it is . 
  sd is the largest party among men , the third largest party total ( closing in on second ) and / r/sweden is primarily made up of young men . 
  the young tend to generally be disinclined to vote for the only two larger status quo parties , s and m. even so i think the sders are only a percent or so larger than the other parties on sweddit , i 'd say it 's relatively balanced and the politics can swing quite a bit depending on what news are posted . 
   economically sweden do benefit from the current immigration nope , and we do n't have any economists claiming it either . 
  in fact the question for people like assar lindbeck , magnus henrekson , jan tullberg , jan ekberg , tino sanandaiji et al is just how much are we really losing . 
  claims and estimates tend to lie between 0.57 % gdp on the low end and upwards of 7 % gdp on the high end . 
   only the refugee immigration that can be economically questioned actually all forms of immigration can be questioned , even a significant amount of work immigration does n't pay more than it consumes from the state . 
  we can see similar statistics of that happening over in norway . 
  refugee and their family-related immigration is certainly the biggest drain though . 
  ( although a fair deal of what qualifies as `` refugee '' here is somewhat broader than what un conventions require )  all non-refugee immigration have a higher economic income than the average sweden . 
  ridiculous in the extreme . 
  the roma from within the eu alone makes that a nonsensical claim , nevermind the east european truck firms that are undercutting union work down south . 
   mostly caused by the extreme need of specialised workforce in sweden  http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/af-hog-invandring-behovs_4476351.svd  http://www.gp.se/nyheter/debatt/1.2397442-bristen-pa-personal-i-aldreomsorgen-blir-enorm elderly care is hardly very specialized work here . 
  the reason why they have employment issues is that the pay and work conditions are terrible . 
   in total the swedish immigration causes a +0,35 % of gdp per year nope . 
  in fact the source you cite , the oecd report , states on the exact same page , table and row as your claim of a 0.35 % gdp in profit that once you account for the state costs ( labeled `` baseline per capita allocation of all collectively-accrued items '' ( excluding defence ) ) in the report then you have loss of 0.57 % gdp . 
  anyone who wants to verify this can open the linked [ oecd report ] ( http://www.keepeek.com/digital-asset-management/oecd/social-issues-migration-health/international-migration-outlook-2013_migr_outlook-2013-en ) and head on over to page 159 ( 161 in the viewer ) and check out table 3.7 to see just how skarion intentionally misrepresents this . 
  you already know this of course because you 've been told this almost every time you post it over at worldnews , sweddit and here and yet still keep on lying about it . 
   you conveniently ignore how they were abusing women on the street as well prior to that incident . 
  seems i missed out during editing to add `` and friends '' of said comedian . 
  not that i intend to defend either of them , i was quite happy to seem them go . 
   after reading this , it 's clear that there 's no point speaking with you . 
  i do n't think you 're really capable of discussion anyway . 
  the only time you post about swedes is to talk for us and run away when people call you out on it . 
   the social democrats are still marxists and have always been marxists . 
  they are not and have n't even allowed them since 1919 . 
  they were social corporatists and are rather stagnant centre-liberals . 
   the social democrats believe that that the revolution of the working class is a slow process through elections and government policies - not one of beating others with a stick . 
  they have n't seriously worked for any such notion since per-albin hansson took the leadership in 1925 . 
  the closest you got to it was palme 's disastrous l\u00f6ntagarfonder . 
   the swedish social democrats webpage , http://www.socialdemokraterna.se/upload/central/dokument/pdf/v%c3%a5rt%20parti/partiprogram.pdf the current social democrats are certainly not marxists no matter what their party program pretends , it 's no more than words to the effect of the democratic people 's republic of korea . 
  you can hardly find a bigger bunch of bourgeoise caviar capitalists outside of the moderates . 
   except in stockholm , and in the later conquered scania , sweden had always extensive equality . 
  yeah , like when only the rich could vote prior to ww1 . 
  actually no need to go back that far . 
  how about you go and ask your great grandmother about the huge differences in status and class between say certain professions . 
   you are using tino 's incorrect numbers . 
  tino 's correct numbers you mean . 
  i know you dislike how he absolutely demolished your ( continued ) abuse of the oecd report . 
   less than 20 % of walloons staid in sweden , with the ones that staid in sweden permanently is calculated to be about 1000-1200 families ( not individuals as you claim ) . 
  source ? 
  i know enough not to take your word for it . 
   giving that there were about 38,000 wallon individuals in the 17th century that 's certainly a massive number considering the very limited transport of people at the time . 
  no doubt you have a credible source for this claim as well ? 
   that 's equal to about 5 % of the total swedish population of the time . 
  immigration we do n't even have now . 
  hmm , i wonder if you 're not just lying again . 
  better post a source for it . 
   http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/valloner_i_sverige `` the number of walloons that came to stay in sweden was small , it 's uncertain exactly how many it was . 
  the national encycopedia gives the number of 900 individuals that stayed in sweden permanently . 
  de geers notes gives the number 134 walloon workers who up until 1633 only came to norrk\u00f6ping . 
  around 20 % of the walloons returned to their homeland after a first contract period , some from 1654 when the freedom of religion was restricted . '', 
  and then comes your claim of `` for the majority the move became permanent . 
  the total number of migrants who came during this time - 1652 came an order forbidding it , has been estimated to around 1000 or 1200 family units . '', 
  i note that this later claim has no source at all in the article whereas the first two ones claiming the number was small do . 
  the second wiki link does n't mention immigration prior to the 1930s at all but death and disease . 
   and then you are excluding the scots , irish , english , welsh , french and germans - that together were a larger group than the walloons source ? 
  because it 's funny but outside of the germans none of the others i 've ever heard mentioned as a larger group than the walloons . 
  in fact the walloons and hansa traders are pretty much the only relevant citations for immigration to sweden prior to ww2 and even then they are always discussed as being small groups by reputable sources . 
   what 's next , you are still trying with slander as you always are - always lacking any source but just licking off your master tino 's butt ? 
  no , just a basic capability to read the reports you cite and having seen you get told time and time again even without tino 's massive debunking of your ( or in his case dn 's ) bullshit . 
   meanwhile we can have statistics , all citing the oecd which shows a net loss of 0.57 % gdp after including costs to the state . 
  which is on the exact same page , table and row as your bullshit claim of a profit . 
  nope . 
  that 's the local delegate in h\u00f6\u00f6r 's backyard ( she 's the one in the picture ) and she was kicked out over it . 
  mikael jansson was party leader back then ( between 1994-2005 ) and he lives in g\u00f6teborg , he instituted a ` uniform ban ' in response to drive out any remaining skinheads . 
   and the sweden democrats were only dressed in military uniforms and with ak-47s at parades and at national meetings there 's plenty of footage from their marches in the 90s and neither uniforms nor ak-47s are present . 
  the worst you 'll find are the skinhead & bomber jackets crowd who got kicked out under jansson . 
  posting a crazy who got kicked out and was the primary reason why they put up new rules for local delegates , classy . 
  have [ a real picture of the party 's meetings , circa 1995 . 
   except for the party founders gustav ekstr\u00f6m , fritz h\u00e5kansson and g\u00f6sta bergqvist i take it you got this from reading expo considering it 's ridiculously inaccurate ? 
  ekstr\u00f6m , the eastern front volunteer , was not a party founder but an early member .

  are . 
  sure , it 's more similar to the indian panc that inspired punch than those , but it 's still it 's own drink . 
  i 'm just saying the punsch and punch are n't the same since your comment seemed to really make a point of that not being swedish . 
  nothing more . 
  punsch is uniquely swedish ( + a bit finnish as we were one , but more popular here ) , punch is n't . 
  just like sangr\u00eda is spanish and caipirinha is brazilian . 
  it 's not wikipedia being wikipedia , they 're not synonymous . 
  punch ! = punsch . 
  as it says at the very top of the very wiki page / u/jesuissuedois linked , `` punsch is not to be confused with punch '' . 
  the origin for the swedish name is disputed . 
  that it 's derived from the english `` punch '' is but one of the possibilities . 
  you could argue that it , like sangr\u00eda , is a subtype of punch , but they do not equal each other . 
  the english `` punch '' is referred to as `` b\u00e5l '' in swedish , `` punsch '' is something different . 
   your post was one of the reasons i started this thread , so do n't think you 're not being heard . 
  no no , i do n't think that . 
  i just wanted to reiterate it since you asked what we thought could be improved . 
   i 'm afraid that 's not / r/askreddit problem , but just reddit problem . 
  think you mean / r/askeurope but yeah , i know . 
  that 's exactly what i said in the second sentence of that paragraph !, 
   i just wanted to mention it for people to see . 
  i do n't think this sub is the worst offender , but it 's a trend i 've unfortunately noticed increasing here . 
  according to the national [ public health agency ] ( https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/livsvillkor-levnadsvanor/alkohol-narkotika-dopning-tobak-och-spel-andts/tobak/utvecklingen-av-bruket/ ) for 2015 : 10 % of boys and 14 % of girls claim to smoke in year 9 ( i.e. 
  15-year-olds , technically primary school here ) . 
  25 % of boys and 27 % of girls claim to smoke in year 2 of the gymnasium ( i.e. 
  17-year-olds ) . 
  i present to you [ the vodka belt ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/vodkabelt.png ) . 
  the name `` vodka '' was n't really used that much in sweden until we wanted international sales though , it was referred to as * br\u00e4nnvin * ( `` burn wine '' ) as all other strong , clear , distilled spirits . 
  polish and finnish vodka is also really good . 
  no , never . 
   do you think its common in your area ? 
  no clue . 
  hey now , the root vegetable should n't be capitalised unless it starts the sentence . 
  if you capitalise it mid-sentence it magically transforms into a person linguistically . 
  it 's believed to have originated in the scandinavian region . 
  and it 's known to have spread to a lot of places from just sweden , which is why it became known as the `` swedish turnip '' and the shortened `` swede '' in some places . 
  in 17th century german it 's also denoted as `` schwedische r\u00fcbe '' because it came from sweden . 
  in north american english it 's commonly called `` rutabaga '' , which comes from a dialectal swedish word for the root vegetable . 
  in sweden we just call it descriptively , * k\u00e5lrot * ( `` cabbage root '' ) . 
  but that 's probably enough neep knowledge for today . 
  it 's hidden for five minutes here , but i do n't know how much hiding it actually affects voting on a sub like this . 
  this is a small sub and i do n't think it has that much actual hivemind behavior , i think it 's mostly just biased voting presenting itself as such . 
  you ca n't remove it , you can only hide it with custom css . 
  which this subreddit actually does for non-subscribers . 
  you could of course hide it from everyone , but it 's very easy to disable custom css and it would n't affect most mobile clients at all . 
  and by removing it , you also remove the possibility of using it for its intended purpose : to downvote people not actually contributing . 
   what could use an improvement ? 
  i think the flairs need to be reworked . 
  i 've [ already voiced some of my concerns ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/62xktz/the_papal_states_are_no_more_new_flairs/dfpv9wr/ ) about them , and stand by what i said then . 
  sometimes i feel it get 's a little hivemindy and that people vote too much based on their preference . 
  but i know this is difficult to prevent and is prevalent all over reddit , so i do n't really know what could be improved . 
  i 've not really faced much of that myself as my view seem to align pretty well here , but i 've seen it and do wish people would stop downvoting people who actually contribute just because they disagree . 
  i disagree with a lot too , but i do n't try to silence them because of it . 
  downvoting 's for stuff that does n't contribute . 
  i know reddit is an awful platform for discussion , but since this is a small sub i 'd wish we 'd keep it civil . 
   what do you think about the traffic here ? 
  pretty good . 
  if it gets too big i 'd probably leave . 
   would you say your country has a strong enough presence here ? 
  i suppose . 
  we generally do on reddit . 
   are they actually shown on mainstream channels ? 
  nope . 
   nba basketball is pretty popular to play with simplified rules during pe , and there is a small competitive scene . 
  but i do n't know a single person who watches nba or such . 
   nhl not really . 
  hockey 's very popular , but nhl not as much . 
  easily the easiest american sport league to watch , but it does n't really have that great following . 
  it 's more our own leagues and international hockey that draws crowds . 
   nfl american football is even less popular than rugby , and the average swede gives a rat 's ass about the latter . 
   and i assume baseball is an unknown sport in europe ? 
  not unknown , everyone knows what it is . 
  but no one watches it . 
  everyone knows [ br\u00e4nnboll ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/br%c3%a4nnboll ) is the real `` hit ball with bat and run '' - game !, 
  we had a [ swedish translation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_xenfz8dmq ) of the english song . 
  the [ original japanese intro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7csb1izu_8u ) sounds more like the german one / u/buddhakekz linked . 
  yeah , i know . 
  when i lived in spain i was apartment hunting for quite a while and went on a ton viewings . 
  i think i must 've seen every combination possible ... 
  i remember once i was in a building without * any * numbering or door bells giving hints at all , and they 'd told me to knock when i got there , so i ended up standing there knocking on a storage room like a fool ... and , not to brag , but i do have a real nice machine . 
  i still use the big ones in the basement when i have a lot of laundry , but my own is good enough for regular use . 
  actually there 's no fighting here either , i live in a building with 95 % pensioners who do all their laundry when i 'm busy working . 
  the whole saturday is always open , and that 's when i want to do it anyway . 
  so , ha !, 
  if there is more than one residence on the same address , there is an ordinance requiring a four digit apartment number per residence . 
  i 've not heard of any exceptions . 
  you can read about it on [ lantm\u00e4teriet ] ( https://www.lantmateriet.se/sv/fastigheter/fastighetsinformation/lagenhetsregistret/innehall/lagenhetsnummer/ ) , if you 've really never heard of it . 
  that said , those numbers are what 's in the official registry and some property owners use their own systems too . 
  as i said my apartment is registered on `` 1201 '' , but is otherwise known as `` apartment 3 '' . 
  oh , but the first two digits do indicate floor , the second two the door number , it 's simple !, 
  when i lived in spain you 'd usually just get a number like `` 3-2 '' , it 's really the exact same principle : first floor , then door . 
  we just standardized ours so you always can know regardless of building layout . 
  which was incredibly annoying in spain , i might add . 
  not only do y' all count floors and doors real weird to begin with , it 's also very inconsistent ... 
  the `` first '' floor is often the third , but not always , because that 'd be too easy . 
  and you only seem to count doors leading to actual apartments , which would makes sense * if * i could somehow know which doors actually had apartments behind them and you did n't use the exact same doors for storage rooms etc. . . : / living in spain is so much more difficult ... :p that said i do n't know anyone who actually uses our four digit numbers in everyday life here . 
  i technically live in `` 1201 '' , but everyone just knows it as `` apartment 3 '' and that is what it says on the floor plan by the entrance . 
  `` 1201 '' is really just the official designation which is required for the registry . 
  do n't other countries have some system ? 
  also , how do you know about that ? 
  i have one next to the apartment door , one on the letterbox down by the entrance to the building , and one on the buzzer/unlock-thing ( whatever it 's called ? ),

what is the release date ? 
  `` after your pussy 2015 '' , did n't you watch the trailer ? 
  you , my friend , is colorblind . 
  would n't that be a sight ? 
  it 's amazing that the society has come so far that they 're no longer disadvantaged !, 
  `` chill out bro , it 's just a prank !, 
  it 's just a prank ! '', 
   though the likelihood of him doing something that stupid is decidedly less . 
  you have n't met my call of cthulhu investigator i see . 
  with an airplane ? 
  now you 're just being silly . 
  that 's a trillby . 
  we could choose between i think german and french from grade 6 ( maybe spanish , but if that was the case no one chose it ) to complement the english we took from grade 3 . 
  for french you had to travel a couple of kilometers to another school but german could be taken at the school i went to . 
  seems like they focused on german . 
  yeah i was n't serious in any way , i was just doing a take on the `` gay sweden '' joke before finland could have a chance . 
  hmm , the vagoths ? 
  let 's disregard the german pronounciation of v. 
  they chose a bad time to do it then , the budget ( which also was increased ) was already agreed upon before the sub sighting . 
  yeah , no biggie with foreign military subs lurking around our waters , probably just a prank . 
  estonia pulling new tricks to into nordic ? 
  nice try , we know it 's you guys lurking out there . 
  tracksuits ? 
  well `` nordic '' is a historical geographic area with a more or less common culture , it 's not a political construct . 
  you ca n't just `` become '' nordic like you can join the eu . 
  but i do n't know really . 
  i just think it 's nice when people wants to be part of your club . 
  i think estonia is torn between former soviet occupation and progressive social movements . 
  look at latvia and lithuania , this map suits as an example . 
  i get the feeling that estonians feel they do n't belong there . 
  but this is really something someone actually from estonia could answer way better . 
  thank you both for not pretending to be posting in / r/swarje or / r/danmag . 
  i love you . 
  on a side note , estonia this map does n't help you into nordic . 
  i think the problem is that without the caffeine they would remain in a depression induced apathy . 
  vodka ? 
  come on , ca n't we keep estonia as nordic ? 
  it 's so cute !, 
  yeah i know the swedish guy who uses gas . 
  he 's okay . 
   ask if sweden is a muslim country . 
  i think this one is the best , because it pisses off people both for and against our immigration . 
  it works either way . 
  i did n't know you people from swaziland had this problem too . 
  like a bag , * with handles * . 
  i know that at least in swedish `` united kingdom '' is correctly translated to `` storbritannien '' , that 's simply what the country ( including northern ireland ) is called in swedish . 
  the thing is that `` storbritannien '' literally means `` great britain '' and may * also * be used to refer to the actual island great britain . 
  this may or may not add to the confusion . 
  do n't bother , it 's not worth it . 
  believe me . 
  actually , i think that 's a large part of his point . 
  that 's stupid , they could be above 1.0 easily if they just used it to buy stuff from sweden . 
  why would you ever want to go shopping without a bank card ? 
  i do n't think she 's paying just for her own cotton candy , look behind her . 
  that 's really cool , makes the world feel a bit closer . 
  i think this map indicates that it is time for a preemptive invasion of denmark . 
  ^ ^ ^ poland ^ ^ ^ help, 
   it belongs to fsb . 
  ( formerly known as kgb ), 
  i do n't understand what 's going on here , what am i missing ? 
  are you unhappy with the design ? 
  well i would n't mind the nato forces coming to sweden 's aid even though there are no formal agreements what so ever that they should , along with sweden not having to pull any part of the weight . 
  there 's a big difference between living with your significant other or being married to them , sure there might be just as much love and support , but they are very different legal agreements . 
  because sweden simply * is not * a member of nato , no matter how many exercises we do together . 
  that 's a nice art style . 
  i think it looks too ... american . 
  i 'm not entirely sure why , apart from the stars and stripes thing . 
  nice colors though . 
  what we need is a nice moose on the flag . 
  as we 're not in / r/swarje , i 'd like to say that i 'm sincerely happy for you denmark . 
  good job !, 
  it 's worse losing the fake coins , because then you have to use real coins until you find a new one , and i never have any cash on me . 
  i have no references at all and might be pulling this out of my ass . 
  back when the lidl store came to my town they did n't cooperate with the unions and the staff had pretty shitty working environment compared to other swedish stores . 
  this was my first impression of lidl , so there 's that . 
  the title reads '' ... has n't * formally * been in war ... '' , emphasis by me . 
  so you do n't have * any * years since the last war then . 
  * good going * . 
  we have two hundred !, 
  that 's more than zero . 
  that 's also correct . 
  sweden had 30 civilian casualties and the swedish military had 30 confirmed kills . 
  you might as well send in dalarna 's preschool gender netural curling team for a quick victory . 
  yes , they kill everyone equally . 
  it does n't matter if the target is of gender or not . 
  may i remind everyone that we 're * not * in / r/yurop , / r/swarje , / r/danmag , * or * / r/nordvei . 
  we love you norway . 
  what about swaziland ? 
  you 're actually * the only one * even talking about this subject you know . 
  it 's like you 're arguing with yourself . 
  he actually never says it 's a volvo , it 's just heavily implied . 
  i do n't think it will hold up in court . 
  i think i 'll get something lithuanian from systembolaget on my way home , i usually ca n't decide what to get anyway . 
  it 's only phobia if it 's irrational . 
  hide it under a layer of really smelly marijuana . 
  i do n't buy russian vodka for one . 
  and that 's like 95 % of their exports right ? 
  what are every-day lithuanian goods i can buy as i private consumer ? 
  i 'm thinking like a reverse boycott . 
  lol , step up your game denmark , we can barely see you back there !,

  direct democracy feels like the best . 
  however , with people in this country spread out so much and not at all dense . 
  staging a dircet democracy ( unless a flawless electronic system ) is very * very * hard . 
  no there would n't . 
  the reason nothing has happened is because it literally came out sunday evening . 
  people are just waking up as we are writing these right now . 
  shitstorm will ensue . 
  no matter if the perpetrators are brown or white or if the victims are poor or rich . 
  the ones this happened to are middle class . 
   there 's a big difference between assault , sexual assault and rape . 
  mate , sweden has more definitions of rape than most western world countries has . 
  what you define as sexual harassment can very well be rape . 
  and even if no one was `` raped '' in the sense of an american traditional view of it . 
  there were still girls , as young as twelve that got sexually harassed . 
  and / u/visiblysane tried to excuse that . 
  either that or he missenterperated this whole ordeal . 
  which i think is more likely . 
  my bad then . 
  i thought you meant that it was okay what was happening because it 's what `` always '' happens . 
  i agree with you . 
  he has a political agenda . 
  if he gets the sweden he wants through his acts . 
  he 'll do it . 
  do your fact checking fuck nut . 
  the article op linked to was svt and that 's * their * wording . 
  but the article that svt *** reported *** about and `` rewrote '' . 
  says what op said . 
  in other words . 
  svt rewrote the original thing with their political agenda like they always do . 
  partially . 
  this happens . 
  but certainly not to every one . 
  we have a terrorist group here that our safety police ( s\u00c4po kinda like fbi ) deemed to be one of swedens biggest threats . 
  that is called `` afa '' . 
  `` anti fachist action '' . 
  those were also the guys that beat that migrant worker . 
  they beat every one right of the socialist democrats . 
  but this is just in `` protests '' . 
  sometimes though they attack individualls . 
  like when our swedish local whiteboy rapper `` sebbe staxx '' ( hates cops , carries pistols , gets arrested etc ) decided to `` fuck up '' a `` nazi '' . 
  him and afa thugs decided to * axe * a door down and throw molotov coctails into a house . 
  containing , not a nazi . 
  but a * mother and a daughter * . 
  they are bathshit insane and behave and talk just like * real * nazis . 
  but luckely they are on the decline in population . 
  nope . 
  it 's just gotten out . 
  it 's sunday night . 
  it 's still a mess . 
  i 'm looking forward to this week . 
  people are in for some extra strong coffee when they wake up in four hours . 
  they just hired the chief of a strong leftist newspaper to be their tv program director ( pics what to air on tv ) . 
  they need to appear neutral . 
  that 's the point . 
  the one that said `` it 's been out there '' is trying to save his ass . 
  then what was the point in your comment ? 
  no it 's not . 
  what the *** fuck *** do you mean it 's '' * just * politics '' . 
  they are the *** police *** . 
  they are covering up rape and sexual harrasment to push a political agenda . 
  that 's illegal . 
  it happened to regular swedish teenage girls . 
  and you 're trying to excuse it . 
  nope . 
  he 's not . 
  and the reason why is to prevent people with a political agenda to reach the position . 
  *** which failed *** . 
  what facts ? 
  the chief was *** not *** afraid of the media . 
  he is publicly a leftist and when he worked as chief of migrations office he even tweeted about how jimmie \u00c5kesson makes him puke . 
  the dude is trying to alter sweden because of his political views . 
  not because he is afraid of what the media would think of him . 
  shameful ? 
  that 's downright *** corruption *** and it 's *** illegal *** . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/40ciqb/%c3%b6vergreppen_p%c3%a5_festivalen_i_stockholm/cyt7a7p their chief , [ dan eliasson ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/dan_eliasson ) , got the job as national police chief because when he was head of the social insurance agency tweeted '' [ usually i keep to the social insurance agency . 
  but jimmie \u00c5kesson ( party leader of the swedish democrats ) in debate makes me puke ] ( http://www.svd.se/myndighetschef-kraks-over-akesson ) ! '', 
  he has also been the chief of the migrations office and been a state secretary ( as in *** the *** state and not a `` state '' as the american meaning ) for thomas bodstr\u00f6m . 
  when he was chief of the migrations office he was accused of `` detail controlling '' . 
  also known as `` tampering with facts '' or as police say ; `` spoilation of evidence '' and to fire personel that criticized the leading . 
  he has also admitted to `` encouraging '' an employee to censor a [ wikipedia article from an `` agency/authority '' computer ] ( http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/myndigheter-censurerar-wikipediatexter/ ) . 
  seems like the land of corruption is the land to claim to have the least . 
  sweden is such a fucked up country . 
  you know those counter battery radars have a very limited range and are amongst the easely spotted radars in combat ? 
  [ have em here in sweden too ] ( https://www.google.se/search?q=kustartilleri&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1258&amp;bih=606&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi_9kouiz7kahxf8hikhcb2b7mq_auibigb ) . 
  stop playing dumb . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3zdqk7/recent_survey_72_of_swedes_want_to_reintroduce/cynzuts there is the explanation of why you are wrong . 
   i give you several reasons for why majority vote does not make right no all you do is say that `` the majority does n't get to decide what to do or what is right '' . 
  over and over again telling me i 'm not explaining why they are . 
   if the majority is always right , why is gangrape wrong ? 
  because the majority has decided that it is wrong . 
  the rapers and the victim are still in a nation . 
  and in this case , sweden , the majority has decided that gang rape is wrong and voted for it to be illegal . 
  stop playing dumb . 
  i have answered all of your points and questions . 
  i have provided you with sources and facts to back up my claims . 
  does n't matter if what the majority thinks is right is absurd . 
  it 's * still * right . 
  and i do n't care what / r/askphilosophy thinks . 
  why would i care what they think when we 're about to un pause swedish conscription ? 
   i 'm wrong without telling me why or how i 'm wrong .

  you can read the whole report btw , it is in the thread . 
  and it seems like the fact that you do n't like billionaires and seem to be pessimistic clouds your judgement as a ) the studies b ) was a wealth tax is . 
  in sweden is was for everyone owning over 80 000 euros . 
  not your billionaires - if you owned a house you were fucked . 
  in cyprus i believe it was 50000 euros . 
  so if you save up to buy something you are screwed . 
  is that a smart tax ? 
  why are you defending it ? 
  did n't you even attempt to read the link?are you saying our trade did n't move and swedes did n't hide their wealth abroad ? 
   and the idea of sweden 's wealthy moving to oslo is just so ridiculous i wonder where you got that sort of idea . 
  and no , the billionaires moved to switzerland and london , not oslo . 
  the trade move to oslo . 
  as it said in the link , and as i stated . 
  so , you are saying that our trade did n't move despite the article ? 
  please , back that up . 
  also , i 'd like for you to back up that swedes did n't move wealth abroad , in the 80 's , and 90 's , with the wealth tax , since you are saying that we did n't . 
  our trade that was taxed moved . 
  london , oslo , copenhagen . 
  it was a spectacular failure . 
  [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_financial_transaction_tax ) . 
  even when they had the lesser tax ( like the ez wants ) it did n't work . 
  wealth - a ) really rich person moved home , like h & m persson , fredrik lundberg etc. 
  b ) normally rich ( as in not billionaires ) have been moving their money home . 
  sweden was pretty smart and gave amnesty if you just reported it . 
  i mean , i am sure people still have accounts abroad , but before it was more of a necessity , and it was fairly common . 
  also , sweden actually made money from the wealth tax removal , since more people belived in sweden and stayed and kept their money here . 
  [ here ] ( http://unctad.org/en/publicationslibrary/webdiaeia2014d1_en.pdf ) is the full report . 
  he is dead , but the brand could do it i suppose . 
  just not that horrible stella mccartney . 
  you have a lot of designers and i really think you should use them . 
  i 'd like to see vivianne westwood make the uk clothes ... . :-) . 
  i googled it and apparently italy used to have the house of savoy 's coat of arms on its flag , and the house of savoy 's colour is blue . 
  so , presumably , they started to play in blue pre wwii and then just never changed it . 
  yes , but i do not ever understand why italy is blue , should n't they be green/white/red ? 
  fun fact - nine of those elements were found in [ ytterby quarry ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ytterby ) outside of stockholm ( i have no idea why the english version says seven , it is supposedly nine ) . 
  and , four of those elements are named after ytterby . 
  why is italy always wearing blue ? 
  i have no idea . 
  i imagine after the winter olympics h & m might sell some of the stuff in their swedish stores . 
  do n't really think the rest of the world is interested in a jacket with three crowns ( our symbol ) or sweden on it . 
  i know after the olympics 2010 you could buy some of the clothes in a sporting store chain here in sweden for a short while . 
  but norway , always a serious contender in winter sports is not going down without a fight . 
  i liked france 's clothes . 
  maybe a tad strict , but good . 
  and , the total opposite to the us . 
  have you seen those ? 
  [ link ] ( http://www.kansascity.com/2014/01/23/4771052/opening-ceremony-outfits-unveiled.html ) . 
  it is sort of like an ugly christmas sweater , with an american theme ... 
   why should we accept that abuse ? 
  if you do n't have a constructive alternative , stop bitching around and shut up . 
  if you ca n't bear that , leave . 
  if you ca n't stand it - you should leave . 
  but again , i have better things to do than to argue with idiots , who neither know economics , takes responsibility for the situation they are in , nor do you and your ilk respect the law or bother to follow it . 
  have fun - enjoy your depression . 
  you 'll need to bail out greece again in mayand your heading towards deflation . 
  even germany will only have 0,4 % growth . 
  but keep on blaming us for that - go back to your whining and not taking responsibility . 
  i 'll go back to respecting the law , and growth . 
   southern europe was in for a hard time anyway , due to the banking crisis . 
  how would they be better off without the euro ? 
  yes - but they would have had a floating currency , and a chance to sell their product . 
   across-the-board price increase of imports , including energy an resources , gutting buying power of wages in favor of big owners with external bank accounts . 
  not to mention that there would be less of an economy to cut to start with . 
  source for that the greek economy ( and the portuguese or spanish ) would have been smaller than it is now , and in more trouble . 
  furthermore - again , you are ignoring economics 101 - which is [ internal devaluation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internal_devaluation ) . 
  why are you ignoring that ? 
  are you not aware that it is wrecking havoc in southern europe ? 
  or are you saying that they have none and it is not causing suffering ? 
  are you honestly saying it would have happened with their own currency ? 
  and , you do know how one offsets that , do n't you ? 
  - with permenent transfers . 
  where are the ez 's permanent transfer ? 
  could you please show me the new treaty ? 
   we 're not quite as save-happy yet . 
  but to some extent , that is inevitable , with or without euro : the eu and japan both are highly productive economies with a stabilizing and aging population . 
  you just do n't get 10 % growth rates in that situation . 
  no , it is not inevitable , we are not there . 
  nor is the us , or the uk or , or ... i 'd like a source for that it is inevitable . 
  of course i have access to academic journals . 
  and , you are wrong . 
   blaming everything that goes wrong on the euro is not a fact , it 's an assertion . 
  you could just as well blame it on gay marriage , that would make about as much sense . 
  wrong again . 
  no , it is economics 101 - what happens when a country suffers from internal devaluation , and yes , it is the fault of the euro . 
  please , do not take my word for it . 
  [ link ] ( http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2013/04/23/greece-internal-devaluation-update/ ) . [ link ] ( http://www.social-europe.eu/2013/01/internal-devaluation-and-the-crisis-in-europe/ ) . 
  again - you ignore that . 
  it is a real connection , and not just made up . 
  economics is a science you know . 
   because the eu really is n't that powerful and national interests still have a decisive influence in structures where it should n't . 
  not an answer . 
  why do n't you follow the rules and regulations ? 
  what gave you the right to ignore them and fuck up for everybody ? 
  why do you still ignore them ? 
  how can you build anything if none of you respect rules and regulations and do n't give a shit ? 
  why do n't you kick out countries for example , and stop bailing out ? 
  who has given you the right to disrespect the rules and mess up ? 
  why are n't you taking repsonsibility ? 
   mostly because of the eurosceptic hypocrites that drag their feet all the way , complain about every tiny little detail without constructive alternatives , threaten to leave at any turn , exact exceptions and opt-outs for themselves and national vetoes wherever possible , demand instant perfection ... and when the enterprise still succeeds despite their obstruction , they 're the first to seat themselves at the banquet and loudly demand their share of the benefits , proclaiming the success of their policies . 
  that is rich - now you are blaming * us * .

  that just looks like a generic house . 
  they are just too expensive and require too much land . 
  why waste that on something temporary . 
   and the effect of ethnic swedes doing less babies due to not being able to afford home anymore will escalate even further where does this argument come from ? 
  for the past 30 years of immigration debates ( as long as i 've been following them , i 'm old ) this has never been an argument other than for immigration ( `` we have fertility below replacement rate , so immigration is good to offset the demographic shift '' ) and suddenly this has popped up five times in the past few months as something immigration is causing rather than solving . 
  we have the third highest fertility rate in the eu . 
  it 's quite ok . below replacement rate , but it has been there for the past 60 years and immigration has been used to offset the negative effects of it . 
  and regarding the housing bubble . 
  i 'm not even sure it 's actually a bubble ( he says after selling his apartment with 800 % profit and moving into a rental ) . 
  right now the housing prices ( in stockholm/g \u00f6teborg / malm\u00f6 , there is n't a bubble or shortage in many more places outside the large cities in sweden ) are on par where they should be when looking at housing price to income ratio . 
  stockholm has something around 14th highest incomes in the world and 12th most expensive apartments . 
  the reason for the prices going up so much is that 's almost impossible to build anything ( some nimby shot down yet another good project just last friday because it would ruin his view from some cementery ) . 
  housing prices are mostly unrelated to immigration because those prices are driven by people with large incomes who move into the large cities from the countryside . 
  refugees ca n't afford an apartment in stockholm so i suspect they have 0 effect on those prices . 
  they also have 0 effect on rent because rent is regulated and they do n't have the queue time to use it . 
  they do have an effect on the subletting rents though , but anyone born here or who has lived here for 10 + years does n't care . 
  why do you think you get those stories about refugees refusing the get off a bus when they got bussed to some buttfuck nowhere . 
  because they are dumped in towns where most of the normal people already moved to stockholm/malm \u00f6 / g\u00f6teborg . 
  stockholm with 20 + % of the population of the country received 0.4 % of the refugees last year and will be forced by the government to up that to 2 % this year which they 'll do by building [ modular buildings like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/swtkozy.jpg ) ( that 's an actual picture from marketing from a company that builds those specifically for refugees ) . 
  so many people on the internet are thinking that this is something new and that it has n't been done for decades and we have no experience dealing with it . 
  sure , it was a bit overdone last year , but not by much . 
  immigration last year was only 30-50 % bigger than the year before . 
  sweden knows how to use immigrants to their fullest potential while keeping all the good stuff to ethnic ( or well integrated ) swedes . 
  that 's why 50 % of the unemployed are refugees ( which means that the unemployment rate for non-refugees is 3.5 % ) . 
  debt to gdp is dropping . 
  which loans are you talking about ? 
  why are you interested in the results after 25-30 years of a policy rather than 20 ? 
  this happened and was well published for years before he allegedly raped someone . 
  even wikileaks published a bunch of documents about it . 
  why did he come here then ? 
   thus he does n't want go to sweden . 
  then why did he ? 
  there would be no rape allegations if he 'd just stay the fuck away instead of coming here and trying to become a permanent resident . 
  you ca n't `` claim diplomatic immunity '' . 
  you can be sent to a country as a diplomat and the receiving country can reject you at any time . 
  all diplomats in the uk have to be accredited by the uk government before coming to the country . 
  this is purely theoretical though because ecuador are n't stupid enough to give him a diplomatic passport . 
  what was unlawful was skipping bail . 
  which he did by escaping the jurisdiction of the uk police . 
  it 's unlawful regardless if he escapes the police by flying , swimming , teleporting or staying inside an embassy . 
   violate the swedish constitution which assange and his supporters know . 
  so if any politician ever made the stupid decision to give such a guarantee they could immediately just turn around and say `` ha , look !, 
  they are lying , it 's illegal for the government to give such a guarantee , it 's an obvious trap . '', 
  yes , sweden is such a hellhole that extradites people to guantanamo every day that assange went there to try and become a permanent resident . 
  why do you think he was there in the first place ? 
  he would n't have a chance to allegedly rape anyone if he was n't in the country . 
  then it suddenly changed from `` i want to live here permanently '' to `` they 're coming to take me away '' . 
  he 's good at making up conspiracy theories that kids on the internet believe in . 
  the most hilarious resolution to this story will be when he finally leaves the embassy , gets extradited , the prosecutor gets to do what they want , finds him not guilty ( or maybe he 'll have to wait for a few months for a court to do that ) and he goes free . 
  btw . 
  even if he was found guilty of rape , he 'd be out of prison now . 
  idiot jailed himself and he 's whining now how unfair that is . 
  blocking is faster and easier because the blocks have no legal oversight . 
  either you need to make an effort , write a legal complaint , wait for a response from the accused , convince a judge , etc. 
  or you can just ask an anonymous bureaucrat to push a button . 
  a bunch of years ago the swedish child porn filter leaked out . 
  a journalist got hold of it , contacted a random sample of the hosting companies that were blocked and most of them removed the offending content within a few hours to days . 
  all of them claimed to have never been alerted to the problem before the contact from the journalist . 
  total bullshit spread by fox news who were trying to indoctrinate people that atheism causes suicides based on made up statistics from the 60s ( which was about religion back then too ) . 
  even disregarding that cause of death statistics in scandinavian countries are more accurate and honest than usual and suicide is n't a religious taboo that gets hidden and misreported all scandinavian countries rank at or below eu average suicide rate . 
  finland ( not a scandinavian country ) is above average , but not even top 5 . 
  [ first stats i found ] ( http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/9789264183896-en/01/07/g1-07-01.html?contenttype=&amp;itemid=%2fcontent%2fchapter%2f9789264183896-10-en&amp;mimetype=text%2fhtml&amp;containeritemid=%2fcontent%2fserial%2f23056088&amp;accessitemids=&amp;_csp_=be14f43f3ab04271fcf917d221d83f55 ) but why spend 2 minutes to look at reality when you can just repeat fabricated bullshit . 
  yet in surveys sweden places always near the top when it comes to trust in police and courts . 
  so maybe rules of evidence are n't as important as you think . 
  i 've actually done some reading . 
  the reason for sweden having no rules of evidence ( for which a side effect is that illegally obtained evidence can be used in courts ) is actually quite simple . 
  the lawmakers did n't feel they have the competence and time to regulate every single thing and keep up with changing times and they did n't want to give that power to the government because the justice system is fiercely independent from the government ( so much that ministers tweeting their pleasure or displeasure at some court outcome have been dragged in front of the constitutional commission ) . 
  so the decision on what to allow is left to the courts with precedents guiding them . 
  it is criticized a bit sometimes because it leads to different courts giving different weight to different evidence which means that most cases where evidence is in question get appealed to a higher court ( second level courts are apparently much more consistent ) and it puts too much load on them . 
  in the past 20 years ( did n't bother looking further back ) this has n't really been in a huge problem . 
  the cases that ended up in the highest court were : - dui blood test that was performed by a lab technician instead of a nurse or doctor . 
  the evidence was allowed because the requirement of the poking being done by a doctor/nurse is there for safety and does n't affect the reliability of the blood test . 
  - footage from an illegally installed cctv camera . 
  disallowed . 
  not because the camera was illegal , but because it was given to the police anonymously and a defendant has a right to know who his accuser is . 
  - interrogation transcript with an incorrectly identified witness . 
  generally witness interviews are done in court so police transcripts are n't that very important . 
  allowed because even though the defense did n't know the identity of the witness at first and anonymous witnesses are n't allowed this was later resolved by correctly identifying the witness and there was no practical way to get him to come to court ( since he had been deported ) . 
  - wiretap for investigating one crime also overheard talk about some other crime . 
  allowed . 
  - dude admits to arson when bragging to undercover police who pretended to interview him for a job in a criminal organization . 
  allowed . 
  in your country does the law not apply to the police and they are allowed to do anything and the only way to keep them in line is to sabotage their work ? 
  yes , it is illegal for the police to knowingly lie to a suspect about being interrogated here too . 
  the solution to that is to punish the police officers who do it . 
  not to fuck up court cases . 
   the police brutality case is dismissed for lack of evidence or whatever else . 
  how about this : the police brutality case is dismissed for lack of evidence which means that it suddenly becomes evidence that 's admissible in court in the us too . 
  i do n't see how admissibility of evidence in court has changed your scenario at all . 
   the right to silence is a fundamental right for a fair trial , which means that if evidence breaking that right means the defendant has n't gotten a fair trial . 
  the right to silence only means that courts are not allowed to use your refusal to answer questions as evidence for anything . 
  not sure why you keep bringing it up . 
  the right to silence does n't mean that the police ca n't beat you up . 
  there are other laws that stop them from doing that . 
  and there 's nothing inherent in admissibility of illegally obtained evidence to court that makes those things more or less likely to happen . 
   you 're basically saying that if information is literally beaten out of me , by police or otherwise , it can be used against me in court . 
  sure ? 
  why not ? 
  first the court throws it out because it 's useless information , then some other court sentences the police for beating you up because it 's illegal to beat people up . 
  what 's the problem ?

  but i do n't see why you should feel uneasy about it . 
  how do you think i felt about picking up f !, 
  ballots in my little village ? 
  if i wanted to i could have taken one of each but i did n't really feel the need . 
  in the end nobody cared . 
  because , with this system , you can take a blank slip and write anything you want on it , such as kalle anka-partiet . 
  it 's clearly superior . 
  and instead of kalle anka-partiet you can also write something serious . 
  you 're * supposed * to take a leaflet from each party . 
  that 's how they teach you to vote . 
  take * one of each * , go behind the curtain , put * one * in the envelope and leave . 
  you can even take a blank one and just write the name of whatever party you 're voting for . 
  we used to do that in sweden too but then we realised , why not just make a new word ? 
  it 's easy , it 's more accurate , and it pisses off conservatives . 
  in 1995 ( that 's 19 years ago for those of you who ca n't count ) mona sahlin was minister of labour and used a credit card that was meant for expenditures in her work for private things . 
  she spent about 5000 euros on herself ( at different occasions , it was all little things like diapers and chocolate and stuff ) . 
  she left the receeds and they were checked by , among others , journalists that wrote about it , which they honestly should have . 
  she then reacted in a non-appropriate way when confronted with this and claimed that she did n't understand the rules or said that it was n't so bad . 
  it should however be noted that in reality she did n't break any law and that she paid all the money back . 
  it does n't seem like she had any intention of stealing form public funds . 
  she had to step down from her candidacy to become leader of socialdemokraterna which would have made her prime minister because of it ( in 1995 that is ) , and she also likely lost the 2010 election which also would have made her prime minister due to it 's memory . 
  when sympathisers of sverigedemokraterna say that only sd get scrutinized and that it 's unfair they are fucking crybabies . 
  all politicians get scrutinized , but yeah , it 's unfair . 
  because some we forgive and some we do n't . 
  carl bildt for example basically started a war , but he 's the voice of reason and all . 
  both of those incidents led to them basically leaving politics . 
  they have made their comebacks several years later but are n't forgiven by most . 
  and honestly those incidents are nothing compared to waving an iron bar around . 
  or to be a racist . 
  if you honestly believe that there 's a media conspiracy going on against nationalism i think you need to start taking * deep * breaths . 
  calm down friend , no one is out to get you . 
  i remember about 12 years ago janne josefsson and crew did covert interviews with election workers and found many moderates stating horrible things . 
  one guy said that pinochet did n't do enough for example . 
  he pretty much got beat to a pulp and fed to the crows . 
  so yeah . 
  really ? 
  she wrote a quite long piece about why she was completely wrong for doing it , and even went further about the problems that exist within the romani group . 
  and she did it what , 20 years ago ? 
  sd on the other hand are not only routinely make racist statements but also use it in their official propaganda . 
  i 've got a little flyer in my had stating that the cost of immigration is overwhelming but nobody knows exactly what the cost is because of pc asshats . 
  i have one word for you : oecd . 
  thanks for answering !, 
  too bad about the site . 
  do you know if irish torrents are usually tagged in a certain way ? 
  swedish torrents always have `` swe '' or `` swesub '' in the title for example . 
  you 're right . 
  since my english is okay i very much prefer to see movies without subtitles , and get very distracted if i have to watch a movie with subtitles . 
  even so much so that i used to tape paper strips over where the subtitles would be on our tv in the livingroom when i was a kid . 
  but i would watch a movie with subtitles over a dubbed one any day , even if i do n't speak the language . 
  to each his own and all that , but i do believe that subtitles is superior for the viewer , and it 's also much cheaper . 
  with tv , some people are lazy and just want it as their little chattering friend in the background . 
  ( and some people actually watch . ), 
  but many , and especially with regard to movies , actually want to watch the thing . 
  they immerse themselves in the story . 
  very rarely is dubbing so well made that it does n't take away from the immersion . 
  oh man i wish i could understand irish so i could watch south park in irish . 
  think i 'm going to do it anyway actually . 
  there are torrents right ? 
  are you sure that your brain is compeltely intact ? 
  might want to check it up . 
  careful with that air you 're breathing , i 'm choking over here !, 
  the only entity known and proven to use human shields is the idf . 
  meanwhile , gaza itself is packed with people and they are being defended by a militia . 
  gaza is occupied territory , occupants can not by law attack their land by military force . 
  wake the fuck up !, 
  why would it be ? 
  anyway , i find it hard to believe hamas would enjoy much support from palestinians if it was n't for israel 's continued transgressions . 
  i think if there is any kind of security hamas dwindles and becomes a non-factor as a result . 
  sure , i understand . 
  really ? 
  and these people constantly implying that sweden is a muslim state because they read so on some blog are what exactly ? 
  whatever . 
   any source for your claims ? 
  it 's widely known that r\u00f6d falu houses are the `` typical '' swedish house . 
  only big cities have apartments . 
  are you serious ? 
  that 's post-card sweden right there , and not in any way representative of how 95 % of people live . 
   you do n't really need a flagpole to raise a flag so i ca n't see your point . 
  again , what ? 
  yeah you can have a flag in your window or on a small pole on your patio , but * many of the flagpoles that exist do n't even fly a pennon * . 
  just ... think about it . 
  put two and two together here . 
   people do raise flags everywhere , it 's less common in the city but on the countrside a lot of people raise flags . 
  it 's nowhere near rare or even uncommon . 
  okay , maybe we 'll have to agree to disagree . 
  i say that , in the countryside , easily less than 25 % of people fly a flag of any kind . 
  ( i would call that common for sure ! ), 
  that is the actual countryside , not the suburbs . 
  by the way , that 's a fraction of sweden 's population living in the countryside . 
  as i said , it 's much more common on the countryside and in actual summerhouses . 
  * those are not typical swedish houses . 
  * emptly flagpoles are a common sight . 
  think about that for a moment . 
  i 'm not saying people do n't fly flags from their balconies in the city or on the patio of villas in the suburbs , because they do . 
  but it 's not common in any way . 
  edit : finally , the countries that you list are examples of `` non-controversial '' flags . 
  no one cares about a dutch flag , they think it 's kinda cool . 
  flying an albanian flag is cheeky . 
  flying an israeli flag is weird and i would imagine seems like a political statement to many . 
  not really .

  it is edgy , arty , brimming with history , and -- even better for the scarred veterans of the london property market -- cheap . 
  the german capital sits at the heart of a bigger overhaul of brand deutschland . 
   the country is a more open and relaxed place , seemingly more at ease with itself , certainly more heterogenous . 
  angela merkel , her recent setbacks notwithstanding , is the most respected of world leaders , and the national football team is more stylish than previous offerings and still wins international tournaments ( unlike some others ) . 
   throw in a healthy economy and good quality of life and it starts to look like an attractive package . 
  it 's becoming quite a familiar story : the london property has been put up for rent and life on the kreuz-koelln borders beckons . 
  kraut rocks . 
  ( i have yet to meet many people extolling the delights of german grammar , but give it time . ), 
   becoming german , as those who have had to deal with the bureaucracy there know , is not totally straightforward . 
   as a member of the rootless , cosmopolitan class ( i 'd say `` elite '' but i live in lambeth ) now so out of favour with the may administration , i have been guilty of a woefully cavalier attitude to our family 's passport arrangements . 
  between four of us we can muster passports from three countries . 
   this was never an issue but brexit brings with it the prospect of curtailed freedom of movement for some of us , and the newfound status ( for one of us ) of being a `` bargaining chip '' in forthcoming negotiations between london and other eu member states . 
  and so evenings are given over to searching for birth certificates and getting acquainted with the finer points of pettifogging rules around properly notarised surnames . 
   the newfound enthusiasm for germany comes at a difficult moment for the country itself . 
  the question of national identity is high on the political agenda following the influx of huge numbers of refugees and will be a significant factor in federal elections next year . 
   outsiders might look to germany as an oasis of stability in a union and a wider region that seems increasingly volatile . 
  to many in germany , things look less rosy . 
  expectations that the country plays a more central role on the world stage may be understandable given its size and wealth . 
  but for many germans it is a role they are uncomfortable with , whether for historical reasons or because they do not want be left carrying an unsustainable burden and would rather have a quiet , and prosperous , life . 
   that may no longer be possible . 
  one of the countless received wisdoms offered up after the brexit vote is that the uk leaving will make the eu more german as the balance of power shifts with the departure of one its biggest members . 
  how that really plays out remains to be seen . 
  but one thing is already clear : brexit is actually making more germans , much to many people 's surprise . 
  touch\u00e9 . 
  you know this is an absurd quotation from donald trump , right ? 
  you do know this is an absurd rewrite of a donald trump quote , right ? 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen such a victim complex ... 
  that 's not true , and there 's nothing here promoting violence or hatred of any group . 
  except this is satire . 
  for example ... ? 
  ( in this thread ? ), 
   the most fundamental issue the uk currently has is the distorted view of reality , mainly by brexiteers . 
  but that has real impacts on e.g. 
  immigration , which in turn affect the composition of the workforce . 
  a painful visa regime will deter eu citizens who can work in other countries , and the us is slowly trying to liberalise its own regime . 
  britain definitely has the * potential * fill its own labour gaps , but without migration the lag time is considerable . 
  an insult to the pesos of the world . 
  because posting facts about brexit is `` hate '' ? 
  i think the uk/gbp might also have fundamental issues . 
  its status as a global reserve currency could be minimised if the finance sector really moves . 
  a post-brexit economy is probably going to need a different composition and it 's unclear if that is achievable . 
  that 's all speculation , though , as is the change we 're seeing in the pound . 
  and usually having it involuntarily devalued by market speculation reacting to a major economic decision is not a `` good '' context =p, 
  too bad . 
  if i as an immigrant have to hear every unsolicited opinion ever about my country 's politics without filter , they can handle a few informed and reasoned news articles . 
  it 's always unclear to me who is upset with this . 
  is it remainers who are triggered by the articles pointing out how fucked they are or brexiteers who do n't like their delusions shattered ? 
   it is not racism but your delusional leftist `` antiracism '' you can blame . 
  and of course this `` antiracism '' has not really anything to do with race , it is socialist ideology in disguise . 
  so that 's why the entire right bloc agrees with me and not you ? 
  as someone qualified to say so , no , that is not the reason . 
   if you do n't put any effort into integration you have no proof of them `` not putting any effort in '' , that 's a narrative you have created to suit your worldview . 
  that is disgusting, 
   to put it indelicately , you collect all the strays of the world , but they 're not even domesticated much less housebroken , but now your home starts to smell of piss , the furniture is getting chewed up , others living there get bitten and the neighbors are starting to be negatively affected and what 's your reaction ? 
  i blame people who equate humans to stray animals . 
   their country ? 
  it 's his country , too , but the problem is people have said shit like that to him his whole life . 
  that definitely lengthens the decision for asylum cases for many , although more and more of such people are being deported . 
  about half of those cases that have been decided have been allowed to stay , and most of them are people from syria who meet the definition of refugee by the un . 
  they are clamping down pretty hard on anyone who does not meet this criteria . 
  however , if you come from syria , proving your education , especially in a licensed profession , has been hard and taken over a year in some cases , and people are told to basically sit tight , sit on benefits and learn swedish . 
  many of them would rather be working in their trained profession ( which can be things like , chemical engineer , doctor , etc ) . 
  there was a story recently of one woman who is a trained doctor . 
  she has to work as a ( low-level ) nurse now . 
  noooot what i suggested . 
   and then you have millions of intra-eu migrants , myself included , who do n't have access to free housing , language lessons or any of that stuff and yet still manage to integrate quickly , find a job and become a valuable member of the society . 
  you have access to all of that except for free housing . 
  language lessons are free for all who immigrate to sweden . 
  and if you think you manage to integrate quickly , you probably have n't in sweden . 
  most even eu-immigrants complain of it being challenging . 
  edit : i say all this by the way as a * non-eu * immigrant who has a work permit , a job , speaks the language fluently after paying for language lessons and my own housing . 
  if i can still not have a chip on my shoulder about people who get residence permits faster than me and more assistance , maybe you can knock the one off of yours . 
   the worst thing is the job market , where most employers are reluctant to hire people with foreign ( non-swedish ) sounding names . 
  they let their own predjudices determine whom they are going to hire or not , and generalize for the sake of minimizing risks . 
  `` oh dear , here we have a qualified candidate named jamal . 
  what if he is a terrorist , or participates in car burnings . 
  maybe his swedish is not so good after all . 
  lets instead pick the guy named erik who is less qualified , and probably behaves and looks more like i do '' . 
  i agree 100 % , but especially with this . 
  it happens all the time . 
  a lot of that is true , but a lot of it gets lost in bureacracy . 
  a lot of people sit and wait for asylum decisions for over a year , now ( and quite a few of those are denied at the end , these days ) , and only then do they have access to the things you mention . 
  a lot of people sit with nothing to do day after day , and that isolation slows their integration , and makes it harder for them to get a job afterward ( how many of us would be good at our jobs if we left the profession for a year ? ), 
  and this on top of the fact that there is clearly systematic racism in hiring practices in sweden . 
  well , even among swedes and other residents , there is a housing shortage that pretty sharply segregates people by socio-economic status , and the difference between urban and suburban areas is pretty sharp ( i live in a `` suburb '' by the way , as do many other decently-heeled people in stockholm ) , which increases demand on the little urban housing there is . 
  this is exacerbated by the fact the development and planning is heavily centralised and painfully bureaucratic . 
  the entire system has failed to provide enough housing and the housing it did provide for a long time was in suburbs with rows and rows of flats without any amenities in the area that make it a nice place to live . 
  this left those places to only people who could not afford anything else . 
  it 's one of the single largest failings of the social democrats ' vision for sweden from the 20th century if you ask me , and now we have to play catchup for the well-being of all . 
  even from my rather leftist perspective , i think some liberalisation of planning and development is crucial to build at the rate needed to sustain the growth sweden has ( and wants , by the way ) . 
  and before someone talks about immigration being a problem , 55k refugees have so far been settled in sweden , both mass urbanisation from the countryside and immigration due to labour demand ( including in high-paying sectors like it ) are the main cause of this problem . 
   if they segregate it 's probably because they do n't want to be swedish , they just want your prosperity . 
  that 's false and there are so many verifiable stories and complaints in large statistical aggregates that show that . 
  one of the largest complaints from e.g. 
  asylum seekers is their isolation ; they want to learn swedish to get a job faster but are housed in relatively remote areas with only other foreigners to talk to , so they do n't have opportunities to practice . 
   swedish culture is completely foreign to them , because they 're not really exposed to it . 
  that 's not totally true , but they do live in a relatively split off potion of society . 
  it 's one in which many come into the city and feel scrutinised and judged . 
  they are often spoken to in english because of their appearance ( despite speaking swedish as their * native language * ) . 
  they have relatively fewer role models ( although svt , the public broadcaster , is notably diverse and strives to be ) .

  i do believe in sweden we still have lots of people noticed in war crimes during chechen war but the general narrative back then was that chechens are good , russians bad and never gave them away to russians . 
  putin has been exploiting our own attitude towards russian for the last 15 years . 
  as any tyrant he promises to protect his citizens against aggressors , nato as military threat and the us as economic . 
  and it 's really easy to believe because if you keep giving someone a short end of the stick do n't expect much love in return . 
   but i 'm optimistic about ukraine . 
  i 'm not . 
  as long as they 're blaming each and every of their failings on russia , they will stay locked in this perpetual state of keeping appearances and when something bad inevitably would come out they routinely proclaim `` russia did it '' and continue in the same manner till next time . 
  i mean seriously . 
  anti-corruption reforms ? 
  they have placed [ one of the most corrupt politicians of our time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikheil_saakashvili#legal_prosecution ) on a position of governor . 
  no , thank you . 
  seriously . 
  stop trying to drag sweden in your alliances . 
  200 hundred years and people still unable to understand what `` neutral '' means . 
  nothing like politically sensetive articles in [ ukrainian wikipedia ] ( https://uk.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%d0%92%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%bd%d1%81%d1%8c%d0%ba%d0%b0_%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b3%d0%b5%d0%b4%d1%96%d1%8f&amp;action=history ) , right ? 
  i somehow doubt it 's real or actual full story . 
  if they 'll start doing it en masse , they 'd get a major public disturbance and you ca n't have that before elections . 
  if it 's one soldier only , the amount of money they 'd save is negligible compared to the entirety of their spendings . 
  i wonder if in 30 years it will be revealed that all of this was just another plot to bring russia down . 
  just like they did with oil prices in 80s to break ussr economy . 
  and then they ask why swedes are such a passive , whiny bunch . 
  it 's not only that . 
  if you 're the one who controls this centralized system , you control news and information . 
  no more independent news sites . 
  so i guess the biggest and the 2nd largest armies in the world are not enough to defeat a bunch of armed thugs . 
   russia is n't soviet union . 
  only one that have the ability to do that now is usa . 
  i 'm sure they still have enough nukes to obliterate everything . 
  maybe not 10 times over as ussr but still enough . 
   turkish army is the second most powerful armed force in nato turkey is n't even in top 5 in armed forces strength . 
  ofc no one can compete with the us but turkey is not the us . 
  if turkey will continue to act in the same manner then i would n't be sure the us will rush to the rescue . 
  then again . 
  turkey knows well that such a war would be an economic disaster for all involved sides no matter who 'd win . 
  so [ this picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d2okjuj.gif ) is a perfect representation of russia - turkey relations at the moment . 
  except one is a megalomaniac with ability to turn the world into ash and another is just a delusional megalomaniac hiding behind nato skirt . 
  eu bent over in front of turkish blackmail . 
  we ; re giving them money and all lots of political support in return for them keeping their border closed . 
  they 're practically extorting us and if we wo n't play along they 'll keep sending refugees until we 'll agree to their terms . 
  our politicians turned out to be completely useless in solving any complex issues . 
  iraq can ask russians to help in taking out garbage as well . 
  link to an article which is politically significant in ukrainian wikipedia ? 
  article which is seemingly under constant [ editing lately ] ( https://uk.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%d0%92%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%bd%d1%81%d1%8c%d0%ba%d0%b0_%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b3%d0%b5%d0%b4%d1%96%d1%8f&amp;action=history ) . 
  seriously ? 
  and we 're not talking about `` poland regularly did really bad stuff '' , we 're talking about one particular person . 
  the person which collaborated with nazis willingly , massacred civilian non-combatants , was leader of the organization responsible for what today we 'd call ethnic cleansing . 
  and especially this [ part ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) . 
  sasquatch is also a `` common knowledge '' . 
  or maybe because he failed to provide any source to this claim . 
  just like any respectable ghetto resident . 
   and those nations have n't had strife against each other in living memory . 
  erm ... first and second world wars ? 
  70 years in historic perspective is practically yesterday . 
  great question . 
  i noticed a while ago how seemingly every busted gangster from the cis countries suddenly becomes a `` politically oppressed '' opposition demanding an asylum in sweden or other eu countries . 
  and at least in case of sweden , bureaucracy of granting or denying asylum is so slow that person can stay here for years awaiting for decision . 
  totally putinbots and not because his opinion is a bloody nonsense . 
   according to article , they never entered polish territory so ** it 's irrelevant for the initial topic ** . 
  wow , that 's hardcore trolling . 
  it 's war games . 
  according to article , they never entered polish territory so it 's irrelevant for the initial topic . 
  every war game has an enemy with distinct territory and features , military simply using imaginary names most of the time to avoid those situations . 
  but it again proves the fact that russians do n't give a shit ... and love to troll those who 're crying wolf all the time for 25 years . 
   simulating fucking nuclear attacks on warsaw . 
  u wot m8 ? 
  it 's [ fsa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_syrian_army ) . 
  it 's their flag . 
  i 'm pretty sure there are no more fools left to fly a passenger plane over a war zone . 
   consider if the us would send its troops to ukraine to fight with the so called rebels and downs a russian warplane that 's violating ukraines airspace briefly . 
  that would be a huge issue . 
  no it would n't ( i mean it would ofc but no different from syria-russia-turkey incident ) as long as ukrainian government officially asked for assistance . 
  they most likely wo n't . 
  especially after the whole mh17 disaster but it can still be a political chip in the game . 
  syria is still a sovereign state . 
  russia is there legally so ... 
  i do n't see any difference . 
  plus russians can just gift a few s-400 to syrians . 
  full version oh his interview is much more interesting . 
  [ this part especially ] ( https://youtu.be/2tz1knk5v38?t=297 ) - basically he says that if russian s-400 will down a turkish plane in syrian airspace it will be an act of aggression . 
  hypocrisy is strong with this one . 
   yes neutrality means handing real war refugees back to opressive totalitarian state where they died in work camps . 
  again . 
  why should it concern us ? 
  if you 'll go into `` evil orks enslaved poor estonian elves '' then you probably need to revise history books . 
  in addition , being neutral also means not attempting to pass judgement who 's `` good '' and who 's `` bad '' . 
   i 've been to sweden multiple times over the last few years , luckily you are the minority among swedes . 
  most swedes are normal people . 
  i 'm pretty sure you 've been socializing with either brainwashed by propaganda or very young swedes . 
  and those are minority . 
  especially if you 'll get out of stockholm , it tends to attract bleeding heart `` humanists '' for some reason . 
  i 'm not defending russia . 
  i 'm saying that trusting turkey while erdogan still in power is not only foolish but also dangerous . 
  turkey is part of nato . 
  if other nato members would openly disagree on this with turkey the whole alliance would fall apart starting with turkey . 
  by whom ? 
  russians ? 
  this cold war nonsense that certain countries are keep pushing down our throats for the last 50 years is nothing but fear mongering to drag us in nato to participate in your petty conflicts . 
   would n't be the first time finnish blood has been shed to protect the king of sweden . 
  do n't flatter yourself . 
  unless people will go full retard we 'll keep doing things the way we do them for the last 200 years .

  the only reason everyone has agreed to the current rules are because they could make exceptions . 
  if you remove the exceptions , that consent goes away and those countries will leave the union . 
  someone should tell azerbaijan . 
  implying that there 's a single `` elite '' group who collectively decide things . 
   i said it 's a manufactured issue and instead of agreeing or disagreeing and providing arguments for your position you said `` your opinion is invalid because the issue has popularity '' . 
  you 're misreading it . 
  the point being made was not * `` your opinion is invalid '' * , but * `` you do n't get to decide which opinions are valid '' * . 
  all voters get to decide for themselves what issues are important to them , and there is no right or wrong . 
  it 's all completely subjective . 
  between scania and r\u00fcgen , as i recall . 
  i do n't think anyone even knows how much it would cost to build at this point , though . 
  what , no love for the proposed tunnel between sweden and germany ? 
  that one might actually happen ( though probably not for another fifty years or so ) . 
   people defending a dictator should be called what they are . 
  you mean people defending * someone you think is * a dictator should be called what * you think * they are ? 
   apparently you are the judge that decides what words journalists are allowed to use . 
  no , but maybe what words they * should * use ? 
  this is just biased sensationalism and is just as much propaganda as what the russians are producing . 
  well , the point would be that the costs are the same regardless as all those unemployed youths cost a fortune in welfare . 
  creating jobs by retiring people also means you `` get rid of '' people gradually . 
  it may or may not actually work , but it 's not a terrible plan . 
   id also rather be americas bitch , than china 's or russia 's bitch . 
  the eu has more people and more money than the us , though . 
  it 's just not really used to secure any influence . 
  a step in the right direction is better than just standing around complaining . 
  it 's similar to creating jobs by reducing the number of hours people work per week . 
  if there 's high unemployment , it might be better that young people work than that old people continue working . 
  you 're going to be in a terrible spot 10-20 years from now otherwise , with a workforce that 's too old to keep going and no one with any experience to replace them . 
   t 's a big stupid thing to say or to believe to . 
  i do n't believe this guy is going to be clean and honest or work hard for the people . 
  he does n't have to be clean or honest or work hard for the people . 
  he just has to be * cleaner * and * more honest * and work at least a little bit for the people some of the time . 
  the real question is * whose * several billion euros ? 
  it 's a step in the right direction , at least . 
  increasing your spending is n't going to help . 
  making investments to increase how much you earn in the future is sound in theory , but there needs to be some actual plan for when and how you 're going to actually pay all that money back . 
  you ca n't simply spend your way out of a debt crisis ; thinking you can is how you ended up in that situation in the first place . 
   one perspective is only one perspective . 
  and one perspective plus a random collection of whatever the editor thinks will sell is still just one perspective . 
  it does n't provide you with any actual information , as you ca n't take anything they write seriously . 
  it * might * be true , but it might also be entirely fabricated , and you wo n't know which is which when reading . 
  reading about a story in a tabloid does n't provide you with any information , because you ca n't trust any of that information to be true . 
   well i it gives a different perspective on things . 
  that 's not worth much unless that perspective is based on any actual truth , though . 
  a made up point of view does n't really do you any good . 
  tabloids just print whatever they think will sell , without really picking any side . 
  it can be entertaining - which is how they stay in business - but do n't pretend that reading it will somehow provide you with any actual information . 
   the bias aside , one of those news networks relies far more on facts than the other . 
  i think they 're equally rubbish at this point . 
  cnn used to be good , but it 's been getting constantly worse for a decade or two . 
  and most tabloids do n't even have a side . 
  they just make up whatever they think will sell best . 
  he was also pretty good at herding large groups of migrants around . 
  or really terrible at it , depending on how you see the whole `` forty years in the desert '' thing . 
   these concepts are fundamental to the european union . 
  they 're fundamental to the * current * european union , which would explain why those parties are skeptical of it . 
   im sure polish people could afford tickets but norwegians could afford it much easier . 
  but there are far more poles , so they would n't all have to attend everything . 
  poland is also much easier to get to than norway , so it would be more affordable for foreign visitors . 
   most of them seem to want to eliminate at least one of the four freedoms . 
  it 's possible to eliminate one or more of those without being against a european union as a concept , though . 
  one could be in favor of free trade and military cooperation in europe without being in favor of free movement or a common currency . 
  being skeptical of how the eu currently does things is not the same as being against the idea of a european union . 
  in contrast , / r/worldnews is far right a lot of the time . 
  i do n't think the law had much to do with it in this case . 
  it was entirely expected if you 've been paying close attention to swedish politics . 
  the pirate party has n't been very visible here lately . 
   it makes the term `` far right '' a bit messy . 
  not sure who to complain about that , but perhaps it might be useful to be more precise than `` far left/right '' in discussions . 
  the terms are quite useless , yes . 
  the sweden democrats frequently get labeled as `` far right '' because of their immigration policies , while they 're left-of-center on economic issues . 
   ... last parliament election was won by oligarch whose only programme was slogan `` i am not politician '' . 
  i guess only the future can tell if that 's a good thing or a bad thing . 
  it might be just what it takes for the rest of the political scene to get their act together , or at least die off and let someone else take the stage . 
  ngl does n't seem to be all that far left . 
  the swedish left party ( * v\u00e4nsterpartiet * ) are n't particularly radical in any sense . 
  depends on the sub . 
  / r/europe seems to have a disproportionately high number of young leftist subscribers . 
  most other subs are more balanced . 
  that 's not really an answer , though . 
  it 's just a rephrasing of the same question : why do we worry so much about xenophobia in particular ? 
  if the far left spent less time being upset about the success of the far right and more time thinking about why no one votes for them , they too could be doing well in elections ... 
   is an assertion that can very much be contested . 
  i voted for the far-left in my country , which consists of democratic socialists , libertarian socialists , radical socialdemocrats and greens . 
  that 's `` exquisite '' in my subjective opinion . 
  i do n't think a lot of those qualify as `` far '' left . 
   great debate eh ? 
  people seem more interested in arguing angrily than actually debating anything at the moment . 
  there 's a lot of `` everyone who disagrees with me is evil '' flying around . 
   ... that is the destruction of the european idea period . 
  destroying `` the european idea '' is very different from destroying europe itself . 
  they have their own european idea . 
  it 's just not one you believe in . 
   far-right want to destroy the europe ... 
  the far right want to do things * that you think will destroy europe * . 
  that 's not the same as wanting to destroy europe . 
  you both want what you think is best . 
  they may be * wrong * , but do n't make the mistake of thinking they 're somehow * evil * . 
   last time we tried that some 50 million people died . 
  you could bring up stalin and make the exact same argument against the far-left .

  oh , wait , that is old already . 
  now it is also supposed to also cover all other groups in society that are oppressed , like gays and queers and even men in some ways . 
  ( not people oppressed by race yet though ? ), 
  those `` radfeminists '' might be few , but they are loud . 
  in the same way as a few very loud and rabid mras make anything that even resembles that movement look bad those `` radfeminists '' do hurt feminism . 
  i am perfectly aware that the term `` patriarchy '' means to feminists something very different from the tradition meaning ( 1 ) . 
  that does n't change the fact that what everyone that is n't reasonably educated about modern feminism hear is `` men are oppressors that oppress women and it is all men 's fault '' . 
  the guy that always tried to treat women as equals , just lost his job and the custody of his children and , at that point , definitely does n't feel very powerful , might object when he hears that his misery is caused by `` patriarchy '' . 
  ( 1 ) from my mac 's built in dictionary : patriarchy a system of society or government in which the father or eldest male is head of the family and descent is traced through the male line . 
  \u2022 a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it . 
  \u2022 a society or community organized in this way . 
  maybe you did that claim somewhere , i do n't care to find everything you write . 
  but that had nothing to do with the comment i replied to . 
  i want you to back up the statements `` they 're not indicative of society as a whole '' and `` he sort of thinking is taught to them by ... men , again '' . 
  in particular the second one i consider to be bullshit . 
  of course we need to suck it up some of time , or even most . 
  but there are reasons that men are much more likely to kill themselves . 
  sometimes we do need to vent and show a little bit of self pity without feeling that it diminishes our value in the eye of the people we love . 
   this is why noone is going after men or women specifically i would n't use the word `` no one '' . 
  i know that there is far from a most feminists that do blame only men , but those that do do show their ugly faces quite regularly ( e.g. 
  mantonization ) . 
  i think `` patriarchy '' is a horribly badly chosen word by modern feminists . 
  historically it signified men oppressing women , and that is the connotations it still has , even though most feminists nowadays say that they fight against all forms of gender oppression , regardless if it is women oppressing men or men oppressing women etc. 
  well , i have certainly never claimed it was your opinion , whoever you are . 
  my problem with mantonization is that he/she most likely disagree with you . 
  in his/her worldview there are two gender teams and only one of them is at fault . 
  i do n't see how anything of that is relevant to anything i said . 
  i do think it is the girls . 
  sorry for answering every fucking comment of yours , but they are plain wrong and pisses me off . 
  i do n't know what you get those notions from ? 
  they are contrary to all my experiences in life . 
  do you have anything that support what you say , or do they just come from some primitive idea of `` men bad , women good '' . 
  here you are just wrong . 
  my male friends are much more sympathetic to me or any other men showing weakness than any of the women i know . 
  it 's the women that ask us to just suck it up . 
  swedes are still ruled by quite a bit of traditional values . 
  men are expected to take a bigger part of childcare and other traditionally female roles than in the rest of the world . 
  that does n't mean that swedish men are allowed to be as sensitive as women . 
  we are still expected to suck it up . 
  easy if you know swedish . 
  if you pull out your guns you must be prepared to use it . 
  that is not a straw man . 
  probably did n't elukka think that far , but the stupidity of that was exactly what i pointed out with the sarcasm . 
  i did n't say that elukka is an evil person that want the police to shoot people in the back . 
  i said that elukka is a stupid person because it did n't occur to him that if you try to apprehend people by pointing guns at them you must be prepared to shoot them if they do n't comply . 
  ( or at least be in a position where people might believe that you will shoot them if they do n't comply . 
  the swedish police is n't in that situation . ), 
  you seem to agree that elukka 's plan is stupid . 
  i do n't understand why you try to defend him . 
  they are smart enough to not pull their guns out if there is n't a big chance that they have to use them . 
  if even you can figure out that the police wo n't use their weapons , i 'm sure that the hooligans can do the same . 
  so exactly what is the not very stupid part of elukka 's plan to try to apprehend the hooligans by gun point ? 
  he did suggest that the police point their guns at them . 
  what do you suggest would be the next step then ? 
  i added the sarcasm tag since it clearly was n't obvious enough . 
  for the same reason that when british soccer fans riots we do n't call them white christians . 
  it 's just not relevant . 
  that is an excellent idea . 
  pull out the guns and tell them to stop and then you just shot those that run in the back . 
  i 'm sure that will calm down the situation . 
  sweden has a very wide definition of rape . 
  see assange . 
  this is not riots in the sense you imagine where a big group of rioters throw stones and burn things in plain sight . 
  this is small groups that move around a lot and set things on fire when there are n't any police around . 
  it 's not that easy to identify and apprehend the perpetrators in cases like this . 
  \u00d6rebro is a small town and i guess they had sent some of their policemen to reinforce the ones in stockholm . 
  it 's extremely easy to whitelist a site with ad-block . 
  i usually let ads through on sites i frequent a lot as long as the ads are n't obnoxious . 
  as soon as i see something blinking or animated , or even worse , something that pops up in front of what i 'm reading , i block the ads again . 
  should have been few , not five . 
  do n't think he was going on that long . 
  sweden is most of the time a very quiet place . 
  a few years ago i moved to south africa and read in the local news how foreigners were burned alive in xenophobia attacks . 
  at the same time the dominating news for several weeks in the swedish papers was that one of the major supermarket chains had sold old ground meat . 
  before leaving sweden i though it was very small and boring place . 
  after a few years abroad i have learned to appreciate boring . 
  yes , `` quite upset '' was an understatement . 
  as a cat owner myself understand the sentiments . 
  rather too big thumbs . 
   fem -  few, 
  it turned out to be a 16 year old kid that had been torturing and killing i think it was 9 cats the last ~ ~ fem ~ ~ few months . 
  people were quite upset . 
  it is . 
  you can always put on another layer of clothes . 
  there is a limit to how many layers you can peel off . 
  no , it is n't . 
  there just is n't any law or other that regulates how to leave ez . 
  joining the ez was supposed to be irreversible , so there just is n't any provision for how it can or should be done . 
  why ca n't they leave ez without leaving eu first ? 
  insats careful to write `` in scandinavian cities '' . 
  as everywhere people are more religious in small towns and in the countryside . 
  at least among younger people in scandinavian cities it is unusual to attend church outside funerals and some weddings . 
  and sweden . 
  the article did n't say anything about ethnicity of either perpetrators or victim . 
  timothy mcveigh , anders behring breivik , seung-hui cho , aaron alexis , dylann storm roof , ... 
  my main concern is that there is currently a lot of smuggled illegal weapons combined with a growing number of racist nuts who think that democracy and democratic methods are only for the weak . 
  i remember breivik , mangs and ausonius . 
  i hear about burning refugee camps every day . 
  these are things that are real and happen here and now . 
  i 'm much more worried about these things than that refugees that run away from war and very present enemies would travel to sweden and start to imagine that the swedes are the enemy .
