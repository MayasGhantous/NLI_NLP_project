  journalists and lawyers getting killed on the street , kurdish cities getting bombed , it 's the same all over again . 
  until recently domestic events in turkey were n't really much of concern to europe . 
  that changed . 
   islamic feminism in historic perspective what the fuck, 
  there will be no war between actual nato armies . 
  cyprus is a precedent for that matter . 
  a proxy war is another thing . 
  infighting in the nato would be the end of it . 
  putin as a person is only the greater threat because he inherited the mantle of the soviet union . 
  if erdo\u011fan commanded half the power putin does , we 'd be having a very different conversation right now . 
  which was the point i was trying to make . 
   erdogan has not gone nearly as bad as putin jeg tror det ikke . 
  if you think putin 's relationship with the oligarchs is bad , try looking at turkey where the entire economy is controlled by erdo\u011fan , his family and his cronies . 
  all organisations opposed to him are appointed a trustee by the state which passes the control to someone close to erdo\u011fan . 
  the only reason why he ca n't have people killed in broad daylight is that we are still a nato country . 
  if we were a non-aligned country , putin would look like a chess club gentleman in comparison . 
  quite a few turkish citizens vote for erdo\u011fan and wembley and the eiffel tower still went up in our colours when we were attacked . 
  this just does n't sit well with me and it will only make the feel ordinary russian joe alienated . 
  that was brilliant, 
  this was awesome , i 'm gon na laugh all the way to the prison, 
   are turkish people really this blind no , just powerless . 
  the people who had their eyes open spent the last 15 years screaming at the world about who erdo\u011fan really was while our allies in the west could n't stop sucking erdo\u011fan 's dick about what a moderate muslim democrat he was and how turkey was a model country for the region . 
  he was a product of his times . 
  no , i do n't . 
  and we wo n't ever have to get to that point because france and the eu have rule of law . 
  the constitution is more than a piece of paper there . 
  being liberal does n't mean you have to accomodate illiberal campaigns . 
  i support austria 's motion, 
  [ `` royal navy to lose missiles and be left only with guns '' ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/15/royal-navy-to-lose-anti-ship-missiles-and-be-left-only-with-guns/ ) are we talking about the same navy ? 
  it 's like you have no idea about the last 50 years of afghanistan . 
  unconventional warfare turns a toddler into a toddler with an ak and ieds and boys into boys willing to blow themselves up for a cause . 
  vietnamese were n't toddlers . 
  the somalis were n't toddlers . 
  the afghans were n't toddlers . 
  the iraqi are not toddlers , neither are the various factions of jihadists in syria . 
  with that kind of mentality you 'll never win a war in the third world . 
  just seeing this made me want to play total war . 
  this . 
  based gyro, 
  t90 's fare much better than modern western tanks of similar generation and configuration against atgms . 
  the balls on this guy . 
  i could only wish for a president like him in turkey, 
  he got arrested . 
  fuck this . 
  a footie match between austria and west germany and the ref was israeli . 
  nobody can tell me that was n't on purpose , i 'm laughing my arse off, 
  al nusra claimed responsibility today . 
  you were saying ? 
  agreed, 
  al nusra ( al qaeda in syria ), 
  agreed, 
  apparently he 's been a cop since 2014 . 
  riot police . 
  if that gets verified this is going to get way more fucked up . 
  he got killed, 
  he absolutely does but i think he also has training in arabic because he sounded fluent when he was speaking arabic, 
  thanks mate, 
  i could n't hear it clearly and now i ca n't access the video, 
  he says `` do not forget aleppo , do not forget syria .

  this is what we fucking get when we get al-qaeda fuckers run amok in the country . 
  if you think that this is the chamberlain moment , you 're dead fucking wrong . 
  the eu 's chamberlain moment with erdo\u011fan lasted an entire decade when they hailed him a model muslim democrat and a reformer . 
  this is n't 1938 - it 's 1948 . 
  ukraine does n't border isis . 
  does n't host them , either, 
  seconded . 
  i do n't see why you have to be such a wet blanket over a simple joke . 
  i speak four languages and i know exactly how much work i had to put in each one of them to get where i am today . 
  i used to be a boxer , i know exactly how much time i spent just on my jab , i know exactly how long i fluttered around like a fool before i sorted my footwork . 
  but i did all these things because i have a flair for them . 
  i am fluent in tongues and violence . 
  but no matter how much i practiced i could never draw as well as this guy and that is talent . 
  tl ; dr fucking chill out, 
  no lovin ' like self lovin ', 
  if i had that much talent i 'd be wanking myself all day non stop . 
  i laugh at britain in their pathetic attempts at out-erdo\u011faning us, 
  reddit is n't exactly popular in turkey . 
  someone who wishes to report me needs to be not only aware of the website , but also fluent in english and have a particular hard on against me . 
  so that narrows the list down by quite a lot . 
  but hell , if i do get arrested for a `` thought crime '' , you can be sure as hell that i will wear it like a badge of pride . 
  i hope you like prison food , because that 's about the only personal invitation he makes, 
  the stuff i ate in poland did n't really compare to anything in turkey in terms of fat . 
  i 'm implying that the reason is a different one . 
  dude come on we literally remove kebab,

  as if erdogan wants to join the eu . 
  i ca n't find it . 
  is the people trusting putin the german alt-right ? 
  would explain the difference between russia and turkey . 
  well the eu is n't currently on the table for erdogan to begin with . 
   so close to so many conflict zones that the eu might be weary of bordering iraq and syria in particular . 
  i do n't think this is an issue , it 's easier to stop them at the mountains in the southeast of turkey than it is to stop them taking a short boat ride to greece from our west coast . 
  also we 've already almost built one of the longest walls in existence against our border with syria . 
   there 's also the armenian genocide issue not going to stop an eu membership though . 
   and the potential for a greek veto . 
  very unlikely , they usually support turkish membership . 
  i 'm thinking a cyprus veto is more likely but i think that we 're fairly close to solving that problem . 
  really , the big problems were the fact that the population of eu countries are strongly anti-muslim and thus turkey is already in trouble , and the fact that turkey would vote with gb against every extension of eu power . 
  the latter problem is gone now , and the former will be gone as long as the eu borders are shut and turkey recovers from this insanity . 
  yes , but its going to make it even harder for him to rule is the point . 
  a yes is n't going to improve his chances , it 's just going to let him keep his position for a while . 
  i do n't think its going to be rejected , considering how much of the governments resources are used for propaganda . 
  atleast you 're not literally the feet and the ground . 
  wonder how much they paid people to say `` no '' with their faces on display . 
  why has n't it happened in sweden or the netherlands then ? 
  and why did it happen in turkey , usa , poland and hungary ? 
  the difference is stability and education . 
  we had the former but never the latter . 
  the turks in your country is most likely from the east . 
  indeed , and it 's fairly obvious that he has no plans to join the eu either . 
  i doubt a king of ashes can last particularly long when he has made so many enemies , but that 's another discussion . 
  but what i 'm talking about is still affecting us right now . 
  europeans seeing us as a pretty hard `` other '' will affect us much more than eu membership since it allows the european governments to take a passive stance to anything horrible that happens in turkey . 
  i genuinly think that most of eastern europe would be in our position aswell if it was n't for the eu . 
  just look at serbia and russia . 
  thx, 
  why are you fixated on the current situation ? 
  do you think presidents are forever ? 
  i 'm saying that this is what kept us out during erdogan 's early liberal years , and will continue keeping us out after his presidency , unless the eu mans up and overrules their ignorant citizens . 
  your opinon is n't a `` problem '' , but rather the fact that your opinion is so widespread . 
  it really denies us any chance of joining up with the western side so to speak , even when turkey becomes normal again . 
   edit : have i mentioned that despite being mostly in asia i consider a turkey european ( politically ) , because at do , and i want to make that clear . 
  if anything , that 's wrong . 
  culturally we are eurasian , and probably politically also . 
  i feel bad for you , blocking since i have useful shit to do . 
  i doubt the admins is gon na like this exchange , so enjoy it while it lasts . 
  edit : oh wow , the admins were fast , haha . 
  lol , you 're sinking pretty low here . 
  at the end of the day , i have a working brain and you believe in crazy concepts and try to argue by claiming your inherent superiority to the opponent . 
  good luck in life , you 'll need it . 
  turkey is very much a part of the civilized world , unless your definition of that is europe - islam + christian congo + monkey poo + cheese banana , which would n't surprise me . 
  xdddd, 
  nice downvote , loser . 
  uhhhh , no europe = european continent . 
  gb is in europe thirteen colonies = gb thirteen colonies = / = europe thirteen colonies = north america do n't know why i 'm bothering typing this out , you 're never changing your mind . 
  perhaps you 're literally insane , who knows . 
  haha , that 's the telltale signs of someone who has lost an argument and is too dense to concede it . 
  xddd, 
   accusing a northern european who does n't like turkey of being assyrian is one way to argue i guess lol , the fact that you see it as an accusation tells me plenty of your political views . 
  and the uk is n't northern europe . 
  you 're arguing that some part of the world being controlled by a country in europe * literally makes them part of the european continent * . 
  that 's most of the world , by the way . 
   you 're not a smart man the irony , it burns . 
   i would n't mind , they were european colonies so they could return are you actually arguing that colonies are the continents of their overlords ? 
  holy shit you are really sinking with the ship are n't you . 
   have you seen blonde hair blue eyed assyrians before ? 
  there are probably a few . 
  you ca n't have any other motivation for this absurd idea than being one yourself . 
  lol , so you 're saying goa is european ? 
  and the phillipines ? 
   3 ) you understood all of that but you 're turkish and feel slighted that i specifically excluded your country with my definition . 
  bye nah , your definition is massively retarded . 
  you 're probably an assyrian yourself . 
  i guess you just downvoted me and left when you realized how dumb it really is . 
  huh ? 
  it fills all of your criteria , it 's in eurasia and christian . 
  are you diaspora ? 
  erdogan are n't nearly as powerful as he seems from the outside . 
  this referandum is his only way of clinging to power . 
  oh , so you have some kind of univesity degree in turkish politics ? 
  you 're literally the definition of a sheltered armchair politician . 
  is that why there were open atheists in the caliphate during the middle ages ? 
  get real dude , no one cares about laws that do n't suit them . 
  again , this is simply your own bias . 
  armenia has managed to sell themselves as european through christianity , anti-muslim rhetoric increasing in europe and their massive diaspora , while people here didi n't see any benefit in doing so due to their racism and bigotry against europe . 
  in no way is turkey more or less asian than a country that is literally 100 % in asia and has always been so . 
  yeah and it 's a big problem for us . 
  half of south korea is european confirmed !, 
  we can really use your romanian culture here bro , my bike is too safe right now . 
  : dd edit : it 's a freaking joke before someone gets emotional . 
  one thing to keep in mind then would be that if this mental map of yours is to be accepted as true , turkey is literally surrounded by europe on all sides but the south east , which is kurdish anyway . 
  seems to me to be even less elegant than excluding the caucasus . 
  uhhhhhhh, 
  i love that site , it excludes turkey from first but then changes its mind and uses a picture of the blue mosque as their leading introduction for `` europe geography '' . 
  also they are literally using contradictory maps . 
  mhm , as i suspected then . 
  what is your mental picture of turkey and armenia respectively ? 
  uh , so syria , egypt , maghreb ? 
  i do n't think europeans are particularly warm towards us no , but that does n't mean we should n't have standards . 
  would you let isis rule the rest of the world because `` europeans '' do n't like it ? 
  the best way for my country to resist european anti-turkism ( which by no means is all europeans ) we 'd have to be a strong country . 
  that 's not achieved by constant conflict and antagonism . 
  clearly / s, 
  to our spanish cousins , you may come our country , you may live in zoo !, 
  how about assyrians ?

  if ali is convinced erdo\u011fan must go with any means necessary when he 's working his day job , he wo n't suddenly change his mind while doing military service . 
  the portuguese carnation revolution can be a perfect example for that . 
  in the end , army 's involvement kept the whole ordeal non-violent and made it impossible for it to escalate into civil war . 
  women smoke disproportionately less than men in turkey and take the overall percentage down . 
  percentage of adult male smokers is 41 % , which is kind of an achievement since it fell back from 47 % in 2008 . 
  about one of every two guys you meet smokes basically . 
  except with enlightenment europe did argue with religion - and won . 
  i think secular people should in no way accept to fight religions on their turf , accepting that they are superior to other ideas , protected and somehow non-criticisable . 
  a religion wants to get out of conscience/spiritual and get into the worldly politics and social life ? 
  fine . 
  that 's how we discuss those things : with facts . 
  if they 've got falsifiable scientific theories proving their point , they are welcome to discuss them . 
  if they do n't and want to get into this fight anyway , they 'll lose . 
  nobody forced islam to come into this area . 
  the good ones are really expensive . 
  i 've been saving for a bit so i might buy one though . 
  if there is n't foam , it ca n't be named coffee . 
  also the water has to be ice cold and soft , without much minerals . 
  you have to mix it before starting to cook just the right amount , otherwise it will have a santrifuge effect and the coffee will subside . 
  you have to cook it as slow as possible . 
  the foam comes and goes in seconds so you have to catch it separately and put to cups with a teaspoon . 
  then when it 's finally done ( it does n't give any hint it 's done btw , you just have to know somehow ) you have precious few seconds to pour it or it burns and tastes like shit . 
  also , if you do n't pour it exactly the right way and speed , the foam you worked so hard to maintain disappears in an instant . 
  there is a tradition in turkey where a guy and his family goes to ask a woman 's hand in marriage in the woman 's family home , the soon-to-be-bride makes coffee for everyone so the guy 's parents can decide if she 's worth it . 
  the soon-to-be-bride makes all the coffees as best as she can , except the one she prepares for the groom-to-be , which she makes without foam on purpose , burns the coffee and adds salt to it . 
  with that , the bride 's family can see if the groom can still stay cool and thank the bride after drinking that horrible coffee . 
  coffee is serious business around here . 
  that , for example , is far from the regular ottoman modus operandi . 
  desecrating christian and jewish religious buildings was considered a sin in the ottoman branch of islam . 
  while some pa\u015fas did that in other balkan countries too , it was never institutionalized like in serbia . 
  they have n't been that great with other christians either but with serbs it was a bloodbath . 
  i really do n't know why it was like that . 
  the thing the serbs usually forget about is that ancestors of 99.9 % of turks alive today were n't the janissaries , sipahis , pa\u015fas and the palace elite of the ottoman empire . 
  they were anatolian villagers , which was amongst the poorer regions of the empire , getting fucked by high taxes , [ often rebelling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rebellions_in_the_ottoman_empire_\\ ( in_turkey \\ ) ) and getting mowed down by the army just like everybody else in the empire . 
  ottomans were a dynasty , not a nation so blaming turks for that 200 years after the occupation ended does n't really make sense . 
  turks drink coffee too but not through the whole day like the french . 
  it 's quite difficult and tedious to cook decent turkish coffee so we drink it one-two per day , usually after meals . 
  the everyday ( or every minute ) drink is tea , for it 's far easier to make large amounts . 
  i actually miss turkish coffee a lot living alone . 
  i can buy coffee wherever i want but i do n't have the necessary skills , patience or a copper pot to make a good cup of coffee , and badly prepared turkish coffe can be * really * bad . 
  that i know from experience . 
  habsburgs only held bosnia and vojvodina for a short time , ottomans occupied the whole yugoslavia for far longer and more violently . 
  that does n't justify holding a 100 year old grudge to a whole nation but there is a backstory here . 
  nobody likes being occupied . 
  also ottomans treated far worse to slavs than any other christian minority . 
  they let the greeks hold their patriarchate with protected status but slaughtered almost all clergy when it came to serbia for example . 
  it may be a russian hate thing but i 'm not sure . 
  to be fair they started a world war to kick the austrians out of their country . 
  also we have n't exactly been [ that nice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skull_tower ) to them . 
  just blame germany . 
  we do it in turkey about wwi . 
  they love taking all the blame when it comes the world wars . 
  dude i think you 're stuck at he 19th century . 
  from post-ussr russian shock therapy to recent greek austerity there are a ton of examples where smith 's hand was nowhere to be found . 
  you 're just reciting neoliberal slogans . 
  it did n't work for the us either , you still have high poverty rates and recently the whole country paid cash to the banks because their administrations fucked up . 
  it was supposed to get better after 2008 , but the numbers say it did n't get better enough . 
  neoliberalism may offer some benefits in theory , but it did n't work in practice . 
  as a leftist i always wanted to say that to a liberal btw . 
  damn that felt good . 
  edit : words n stuff, 
  i meant turk in a cultural sense , almost none of the architects until 18th century were ethnical turks since turks holding any position in state was heavily restricted , including the position of palace architect . 
  mimar sinan himself was dev\u015firme . 
  his origin is thought to be greek or armenian , though some historians claim his family were christian turks . 
  i always thought sultanahmet mosque was feminine too btw . 
  she 's got a different elegance compared to the masculinity of selimiye and s\u00fcleymaniye . 
  the building was destoyed and rebuilt countless times . 
  justinien wanted a dome on three columns instead of four because holy trinity and all that , but there 's a reason you do n't put a huge dome over three feet . 
  in every earthquake the dome went down , among other things . 
  the first dome was destroyed in 558 , just 21 years after the basilica 's construction was complete . 
  after sinan 's restorations , it 's standing still for 600 years which is the longest time a single hagia sophia building stood without crumbling or losing its dome . 
  all this is quite easy to find with a simple google search but not doing that and just throwing wbat you think you know without research is easier i guess . 
  thread became a fascist shitshow so it 's pretty normal shit like that is taken seriously . 
  in a normal discussion i 'd assume you 're trolling but this is / r/europe , asssuming hostility gives the right result 9/10 . . 
  visitor count of topkap\u0131 palace alone is about the same as the whole poland so it does n't matter much if you find it cool or not . 
  it 's perfectly normal for an angsty alt right teen to not know anything about architecture . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/topkap\u0131_palace https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/selimiye_mosque https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sultan_ahmed_mosque https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s\u00fcleymaniye_mosque https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_bazaar,_istanbul https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c7emberlita\u015f_hamam\u0131 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karatay_madrasa,_konya https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sultan_han https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/divri\u011fi_great_mosque_and_hospital https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akk\u00f6pr\u00fc https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laleli_mosque https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enderun_school https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istanbul_university https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ishak_pasha_palace https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_mosque_ ( istanbul ), 
  civilians that were born and raised there are n't conquering tyrants that slaughter native population . 
  the greek war of independence against ottomans was just , ethnically cleansing the turkish minority was n't . 
  anyway , this thread is n't about that and i have no intention to discuss it here , but if you think slaughtering civilians is ok in any case there 's something seriously wrong with you . 
  this is an extremely simplistic way to look at sinan 's architectural tradition which has been widely accepted as the eastern counterpart of renaissance architecture . 
  his style affected almost everything built to the east of istanbul , including taj mahal in which two students of sinan worked on the domes . 
  these mosques are the finest examples of this era and the absolute peak of islamic architecture . 
  there are loads of books about sinan style architecture but you can start [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mimar_sinan ) if you want to learn about it . 
  which is inspired by roman architecture . 
  it is perfectly normal to be inspired by ancient monuments around you . 
  yeah sure . 
  we 'll give it back to greeks when swedes go back to russian steppes and give their land to samis . 
  go back to your donald circlejerk sub . 
  no it 's not . 
  until gothic era whole christian architecture was dome based , it is still a common frame in the east . 
  ottoman architecture is certainly affected by byzantine architecture but calling it a copy is like calling every building with columns copies of parthenon . 
  using semi-domes and small domes as support instead of just aesthetic value is part of mimar sinan 's legacy , as well as adding height to the central dome to give interior an overwhelmingly magestic look . 
  you can see much of his ideas since the mosque was designed by a student of his , you can also see a more pure form of sinan 's style in s\u00fcleymaniye and selimiye mosques . 
  hagia sophia itself was indeed a big inspiration , since sinan spent o huge deal of time restoring the building and bonding with it over this . 
  his obsession with huge central single domes have probably much to do with this . 
  the proper name is miklagard . 
  there are muslim counterparts of far right christians you see in this sub who want to convert everything they see into mosques but nobody wants to destroy them . 
  istanbul is proud of its diverse history , the city is poetically referred to as home of six nations , capital to four empires . 
  hagia sophia is n't the only ancient building that is preserved , there are hundreds of eastern roman historical buildings in addition to latin ones from the levantines and genoese , both ancient and imperial armenian built buildings , italian ones from the late imperial period , german ones again from late imperial and early republic period etc.

  wow , i could n't have explained it better , thank you . 
  you 're just proving my point . 
  we 're discussing olympics , and the number of journalists in prison is obviously not a criterion . 
  but yeah , let 's talk about all the bad things turkey did instead , that 'd be helpful . 
  i 'm not pro-government or anything , i 'm very aware and highly disturbed of the current situation in my country . 
  but boy am i surprised that for once journalists in prison came up before the armenian genocide in a totally irrelevant discussion about turkey . 
  edit : that did n't stop china from hosting the 2008 olympics . 
  i 've been trying to figure out for the longest time , could n't come up with any other explanation than this subreddit being full of prejudiced and racist people who do n't know much about turkey . 
  what makes you think istanbul is n't safe or organized ? 
  calling turkey `` a huge political mess '' is a bit extreme if you ask me . 
  sure , turkey has its problems , but how is that a criterion for hosting the olympic games ? 
  or do you think only the most developed nations with zero political issues should host the games ? 
  do you know who will be in power in spain or japan in 2020 ? 
  do you know if they will be pro-olympics ? 
  it 's not like one day the islamists will come into power and turn turkey into saudi arabia overnight . 
  turkey has hosted many international tournaments before , even under the akp government , and `` tolerating '' female athletes has never been an issue . 
  i love how every comment that is slightly pro-istanbul gets downvoted immediately in this thread . 
  or just any positive opinion about turkey in the whole subreddit . 
  i believe he 's talking about the budget allocated to olympics . 
  i ca n't believe how they did n't think about including the eurasia marathon in that video ... then again , listening to music in the background , i think i can understand why . 
  ** turkey ** * [ turkcell superonline ] ( http://www.superonline.net/baglan/fiber-internet/1000-mbps ) * 20up/1000down * 499 ( first 3 months ) , 999 * $ 187,10 ( first 3 months ) , $ 374,58, 
  funny how erdo\u011fan invited a bunch of celebrities who were incapable of producing meaningful sentences to a meeting about the gezi protests two months ago . 
  i guess if you do n't have an oscar or were popular in shitty turkish tv series and happen to be pro-government you can say whatever you want . 
  the thing is he really can not handle criticism well . 
  all his speeches are about what a great leader he is and how he knows everything ( and i mean `` everything '' ) the best and whoever criticizes him is an enemy of turkey who wishes to see us fail . 
  i do n't believe that 's how he actually thinks but that 's the way he addresses his uneducated religious voter base . 
  edit : added a word . 
  turns out it 's only okay when he ( and his party ) is the one renting out pages . 
  do n't be so harsh on him guys , he lives in a country where he can easily get journalists jailed for writing articles that do n't amuse him . 
  he just thought it worked like that everywhere . 
  true , most people would be content with an american who can point out where europe is on a map . 
  / r/europe has never been classy ... 
  it was unclear for a while , but in the end he did n't get arrested . 
  a bunch of people who were standing next to him were taken into custody though . 
  they were charged with `` resisting police officers by standing without using violence '' . 
  and no , it does n't make any sense in turkish either . 
  and also today there were thousands of people all around the country , just standing . 
  pretty much . 
  it 's written on the id . 
  they do n't even ask you what to put there . 
  so it does n't mean anything . 
  recently they changed the law so you can actually have it removed though . 
  unwillingness for internal reform ? 
  i suggest you check turkey 's progress reports for the last 10 years . 
  i think most people here use turkey and erdo\u011fan interchangeably . 
  yes , people always seem to forget that about cyprus . 
  i 'm not defending turkey 's current presence on the island but i think it 's important to see that nobody is 100 % innocent in this situation . 
  well , if you asked the turks , the armenians would have done the same in eastern turkey if they had n't been relocated . 
  they were slaughtering turkish people with the assistance of the russian during war time . 
  of course this does n't justify what the ottomans did , but it 's not like no european countries ( i.e : france , germany , britain ) ever did the same or worse in the past so why hate only turkey ? 
  oh right , because you never know when you might need one more issue to block turkey 's entrance to eu . 
  oh , i could n't agree more . 
  what actual past events earned turkey this antipathy , you think ? 
  if by current turkish behavior you mean the current turkish government , i 'd say that 's a terrible way to put it . 
  i 'm sensing the negativity here on this subreddit is not only towards the government but to the whole country and its citizens . 
  and i think it 's because most people actually know very little of the country . 
  do you even know how that 's calculated ? 
  i hate the turkish politicians as much as the next guy , especially the current government - worst thing to happen to this country . 
  and it 's not like i 'm arguing for the inclusion of turkey to the european union . 
  it 's just that i get the feeling that people here do n't know enough about turkey or have the wrong idea about many things , that 's all . 
  and i 'm surprised because i expected better and now i do n't know why . 
  as ( probably ) the only turk who is subscribed to this subreddit , all the hatred and prejudice towards turkey here really disappointed me . 
  yeah , that 's what the current government does most of the time . 
  update : turkish officials deny the ** rumors ** , no interference is on their agenda . 
  http://mashable.com/2012/09/04/turkey-social-media-ban/ http://www.dailydot.com/news/turkey-social-media-ban-denied-rumors/, 
  it was simply a suggestion from a stupid minister and he is already denying that such interference is on their agenda ( sorry , the only articles i could find were in [ turkish ] ( http://www.cnnturk.com/2012/bilim.teknoloji/%c4%b1nternet/09/05/sosyal.medya.hukumeti.rahatsiz.ediyor/675550.0/index.html ) , which i do n't find very surprising since the foreign media seems to be more interested in those that make turkey look bad ) . 
  long story short , it is not going to happen . 
  it is such a misleading and uninformative article that did nothing but make a big , unnecessary fuss . 
  * edit : i did find some in english afterall : http://mashable.com/2012/09/04/turkey-social-media-ban/ http://www.dailydot.com/news/turkey-social-media-ban-denied-rumors/, 
  well , this , in the article , is just a suggestion too , as opposed to its misleading title . 
  oh and here 's another article shared in a comment below , which i feel is a little more relevant to the case here : http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-11/u-k-may-block-twitter-blackberry-messaging-services-in-future-riots.html, 
  in august , 2002 . http://articles.cnn.com/2002-08-03/world/turkey.death.pen_1_abdullah-ocalan-reform-package-kurdish-rights?_s=pm:world, 
  i assume this is what cnytyo was talking about : http://articles.cnn.com/2011-08-11/tech/london.riots.social.media_1_social-media-facebook-and-twitter-blackberrys?_s=pm:tech http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/uk-may-block-twitter-facebook-to-help-stop-future-riots/, 
   38 / you start liking dropjes never !, 
  nope , i do n't remember that either . 
  yeah but greece has always been like that , nothing weird about it . 
  what 's odd about it ? 
  no , not at all . 
  might be true for 1 or 2 , but no , all 94 journalists did not steal / rape / kill or commit any other crime . 
  this might be relevant : [ turkish minister of eu affairs on the subject ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y4nfbv7qi0&amp;feature=youtu.be ), 
  someone 's getting aggressive , i guess you did that search and found out the truth then . 
  ankara 's history begins with the hittites . 
  you can search online and see for yourself , it 's not like i have articles about it stored on my computer . 
  but if you think calling a landlocked city `` anchor '' makes sense , guess i 'd respect that too . 
   the name `` istanbul '' actually comes from the medieval greek '' \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03a0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd '' ( is tin polin ) , a nickname the citizens of constantinople used for their home town . 
  it means `` in the city '' . 
  um ... yeah , could be but it 's just one of the possibilities , nobody knows for sure where it 's coming from and there are other alternatives . 
  although i personally think it 's quite probable , many of my greek friends thought it was stupid to call a city `` in the city '' . 
  and `` ankara '' does n't come from greek , it was found by the hittites and was called `` ankuwa\u0161 '' . 
  well i 'm sorry but it does n't make any sense to me . 
  i read your other comments too and it sounds like all you know about turkey and turkish people are what you see and hear on certain news channels and i find your concerns unrealistic . 
   because in turkey it self you have a relatively moderate majority , people with good or decent jobs and education that want secular laws and a way of life that is more europe than saudi arabia . 
  turkish people made that choice about 300 years ago , when the ottoman empire started to decline . 
  majority of turkish people today are more european than middle-eastern . 
  plus , poor turkish people are not by default evil , fundamentalist muslims who 'll do anything to move to a european country and change the laws and force their ways of life to the locals . 
  so there 's no need to worry for your little country of 4.5 million , with turkish economy growing like it is today and you 'll eventually see how ridiculous your phobia sounds to turkish people . 
   i truly believe that integration is both possible and mutually beneficial , but treating turkey as just another in a long line of countries joining the eu is a recipe for disaster . 
  that should have been said 50 years ago , when turkey first applied , before all those other countries in line . 
  somehow , although for different reasons , i agree that turkey is better off not being an eu member . 
  itym lygos , if that 's what we 're doing here ...

  also fighting the cops and the army is bad enough but we have to fight off around half the turkish population . 
  so you got like a quarter of turkey , most of whom have never held a gun in their lives , most also has moral issues with killing other people , most leads rather civilized lives and ca n't transform into a hollywood freedom fighter in a day , etc , fighting around 30-40 % of turkey population , cops and army in a civil war . 
  what do you think our chances are ? 
  also even if we won , we 'll have free elections at the end of it , and people will just vote for another erdo\u011fan . 
  why the fuck we should risk it then ? 
  unless we plan on establishing our dictatorship which would be much more preferable . 
  why do n't you guys rebel any kill trump anyway ? 
  if it 's that simple ? 
   i did n't know chp was a terrorist supporter . 
  of course they are . 
  chp supports pkk and dhkp-c and fet\u00d6 and anything else erdo\u011fan tells us . 
   you 're going to have to organize and militarize . 
  yeah , no . 
  no `` liberal '' with a bit of brain in turkey is gon na start a civil war ( which we 'd lose anyway ) . 
  you watch too much hollywood . 
  erdo\u011fan 's supporters need to see the monster they created , let them sink to a hole of shit first . 
  though i do n't really have high expectations from them . 
  https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c3%bcrkiye%27deki_intihar_sald%c4%b1r%c4%b1lar%c4%b1_listesi#.c4.b0ntihar_sald.c4.b1r.c4.b1lar.c4.b1_listesi and attacks in turkey did n't kill anyone ? 
  [ here is another very small list in english ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/01/01/turkey-attacks/96058890/ ) if a politician uses an attack to convince people to give power to him , then that 's fearmongering . 
  opposition parties in turkey regularly give `` captain obvious '' explanations like `` giving all the power to one person is n't democratic '' because the voters are just that thick and ignorant . 
  but of course the opposition parties are a bunch of terrorist supporters and their leader is alevi too so who is gon na listen to them right . 
  people are already paranoid about spies , if erdo\u011fan gets assassinated they would rally behind akp even stronger . 
  they would accuse kemalists , leftists , chp supporters , hdp , supporters of being involved in the assassination . 
  hell , it might give erdo\u011fan 's successor an excuse to ban chp and hdp . 
  talk to some akp supporters and half-jokingly propose a scenario where erdo\u011fan gets assassinated and ask what happens after . 
  erdo\u011fan need to die by rotting in a prison cell , that would be the best route . 
  not natural death , not assassination , by rotting in a prison cell . 
  i do n't think that 's gon na happen though . 
  if we kill erdo\u011fan , the people would see him as a martyr and vote for an even worse guy/party . 
   start collecting dirt on nasty people . 
  cameras and microphones come cheap nowadays . 
  do n't use it yet , i 'm afraid it is too early . 
   when they make a mistake and piss off part of their base , publish it en masse , try to make scenes , drag people to court . 
  but for now stock up on `` ammo '' , and quietly prep translations so intl media can jump on it . 
  what would dirt be useful for ? 
  they are doing everything out in the open , you literally can collect dirt by just reading the newspaper . 
  google `` turkey corruption scandal '' it did n't cause shit , akp supporters just did n't care . 
  [ i found this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xikjkz8xwoo9 ) but there were much more in turkish . 
  you seem to think scandals are ought to dissuade people from voting for them or at least some big uprisings , nope , akp supporters will support erdo\u011fan even if erdo\u011fan comes to their homes and buttrapes their mothers and sisters . 
  there is nothing that can change their mind . 
  so that approach is n't gon na work . 
  how ? 
  we are open for suggestions . 
  turks say `` as if we live in sweden '' as an idiom whenever they want to point out that people are being too idealistic , optimistic , naive , or childish . 
  % 80 yes from akp voters is a perfectly possible scenario . 
  the things that happened since 15 years , akp people supported it all . 
  corruption tapes , killed protestors in gezi , what makes you think they wo n't support this ? 
  at a later comment below you said this :  because akp declares anyone against them a traitor which would only make them more likely to vote yes or hide their vote intentions . 
  what do you think akp supporters think of gezi protestors ? 
  imho you have too high expectations from akp supporters . 
  you will be surprised as you probably were during corruption scandals . 
  some people do n't care about the actions , they only care who is doing them . 
  i kind of want france to elect le pen just to see what she does . 
  how much of these promises she 'll accomplish . 
  how earth will look like with trump , putin , le pen , erdogan . 
  party leader ( devlet bah\u00e7eli ) has sold out . 
  people say he has some sex tapes or some other scandal floating around . 
  he is basically erdo\u011fan 's dog now . 
  i think it 's because he made a deal with erdo\u011fan . 
  the deal is simple , bah\u00e7eli supports akp , and akp keeps bah\u00e7eli as the leader of mhp . 
  there were some dissidents in mhp that tried to shake bah\u00e7eli 's glued ass out of the leadership seat but that did n't work out . 
  akp will not allow that to happen . 
  mhp supporters being % 70 `` no '' is kinda higher than i expected . 
  i think this poll is a bit optimistic considering akp 's propaganda has n't fully started yet . 
  they 'll deceive some mhp supporters to their side after it starts so i expect at least 40 % `` yes '' nationalists are the easiest voter base to fool . 
  currently they are doing small-time things like calling no voters terrorist sympathizers and arresting no campaigners but when the propaganda really starts you 'll know . 
  majority of yes voters do n't know what they are saying `` yes '' to . 
  they just say yes because erdo\u011fan tells them to do . 
  watch any street interview the yes voters are always like `` well ... because ... no voters are terrorists '' or `` um ... because ... stronger state '' or `` because more stability '' just some random buzz words akp politicians say on tv . 
  boycotters believe one or more of the following : 1 . 
  elections are rigged ( small-time fraud does happen , there is evidence ) . 
  elections never change anything . 
  democratic structure of turkey does not allow fair elections ( % 10 election threshold , for example ) . 
  they think opposition parties are bad too . 
  they do n't want to make the government look legitimate . 
  ( so smart ) i suppose the only first two applies in this case ( since this is a referendum ) , boycotters are mostly just edgy anarchists but in general people are beginning to feel disillusioned with the `` democracy '' our country has . 
  nonetheless voter turnout is like 80 % usually which is higher than most countries . 
  turks use `` mersi '' too but it 's not very common . 
  black sea will go to shit soon too then . 
  or basically the meal of every ex-ottoman state [ .

  mandatory `` turkey not europe '' comment . 
  that `` esra < 3 \u0130lker '' carving on the table is a nice addition lol . 
  the foods on the table are things one would eat during breakfast . 
  dictatorships and foreign occupations are different things . 
  why do you think hitler ruled germany until he was defeated ? 
  because germans hate freedom ? 
  what about italy ? 
  or basically most european countries ? 
  i 'm curious about the way you rationalize this . 
  can i ask for an explanation if my inferior presence does not annoy you ? 
  i 'm curious about your thought process . 
  do n't you think there is something ironic about that for example ? 
  all turks = erdo\u011fan according to / r/europe . 
  those kinds of comments used to make me sad , then they made me think `` wow we made westerners butthurt '' but now they just make me laugh . 
  it 's not an excuse to become nationalistic ( although it 's hard to resist the push such comments give you ) , it should just make you realize that some people are not worth taking seriously . 
  becoming racist/nationalistic because of racists picking on you would be illogical anyway . 
  that was really racist , in the most ironic way ever . 
  i just happened to be born inside the borders of turkey to a turkish man and woman , therefore i have no right to criticize others ? 
  / r/europe classy as always .

  there 's no such thing as democracy when the candidates are chosen in back rooms by the powers that be , it 's an illusion of choice . 
  guys ... they 're back !, 
  remove the labels and just leave the colors and the maps can be correlated to many different things . 
  income , temperature , life expectancy , infant mortality rate etc. 
  remember people causation \u2260 correlation . 
  and also perhaps due in part to german islamophobia . 
  i am also an atheist but i 'm not sure if that 's because i grew up in ny where having such a view would n't result in ostracization or because i 'm somehow genetically predisposed to not believe in fairy tales . 
  not a graphic i 'm proud of . 
  and he cost my city of birth the olympics . 
  i 'm positive . 
  it could indeed turn into an egypt/morsi situation well before the election . 
  the military is populated generally by uber nationalist-kemalists , their patience with erdogan grows thinner with each incident . 
  because nobody else would join . 
  the east would n't join because turkey is too western and israeli friendly and western nations would n't join because turkey is too islamic and arab friendly . 
  contrary to what you 're proposing and what erdogan wants turkish dominance in the levant and arabia is not viable . 
  the empire is dead , trying to resuscitate it would be a huge mistake . 
  the reasons you give for turkey being incompatible with europe are the same things that make turkey incompatible with the middle east . 
  aside from islam turks and arabs have nothing in common , even considering islam the average ( western ) turk is n't nearly as passionate about it as your typical saudi or jordanian . 
  despite the akps efforts turkey can not exist in union with the middle east either . 
  so what do you propose , to go on being the bustard child of eurasia with no close ties to anyone ? 
  the switzerland we do n't need anyone else approach wont work for turkey in this day & age . 
  it all hinges on 2015 . 
  crossroads is often misused when describing elections but for turkey this upcoming one truly is a crossroads . 
  a reaffirmation of the akp spells doom for the republic . 
  maybe theyre working behind the scenes to control the med . 
  sea from both ends, 
  i understand that thanks to technology the world is trending towards continentalism but perhaps its too soon to push for federalization , or maybe it 's not the answer to begin with . 
  what if i told you that the opinions of germany , france & austria arent ' t the only ones that matter . 
  culturally spaniards and fins are miles apart but coexist nicely in the bloc . 
  all these convienently contrived rationales are just distractions from the real reason , the powers that be in the eu are afraid of muslims in their playpen . 
  amid economic crises people instinctively turn to their conservative options . 
  it 's a defense mechanism , when your way of life and viability feels threatened you want to conserve . 
  so i can understand why we 're seeing the regression in many places around the world . 
  but turkey was ( for the most part ) spared from the economic troubles of the past few years in the industrialized world . 
  he 's grown too comfortable in his role . 
  2015 will prove to be a pivotal year for the republic of turkey . 
  it could either be the end of kemalism and the republic as we know it or a return to pro-western values with the past year being merely a blip on the radar , all depending on next year 's elections . 
  so in order to prove one 's gayness legitimize their eu asylum what do you propose ? 
  take an eu dildo up the rear ? 
  one scumbag pm who rode a wave of leftist weariness in 2003 does n't represent the views of 70m turks who are suffering from buyer 's remorse . 
  the 2015 elections cant come fast enough for many of us . 
  what most centrist and liberal turks fear is that it 'll come too late , long after the akp has had enough time implementing its fascist rules to ` cook the books ' for the election . 
  why ? 
  do 70million muslims in the schengen give you nightmares ? 
  the closeted racism , it oozes from your words . 
  erdogan is undoing 100 years of progress in mere months . 
  he wishes to raise the ottoman empire from the dead and establish a pan arab islamist state . 
  this clown needs to go before my country gets `` liberated '' by america . 
  in regards to net neutrality , why does america get to unilaterally make decisions about the rules of the internet?the internet belongs to the whole of humanity ? 
  the refferendeum passed , most swiss . 
  the majority rules and therefore represents the whole , thus `` the swiss '' . 
  i 've come to the realization that if earth were middle earth the swiss would be the dwarves, 
  ankara really left northern cyprus out to dry . 
  wanting to mend relations with the eu they cut the umbilical cord leaving an infant baby nation stranded naked in the cold with no safety in sight . 
  a united cyprus is only possible under a secular government that recognizes both cultures . 
  it must be officially bilingual , greek & turkish . 
  if the government leans to favor one side over the other you 're just asking for more wars , if that 's the case two separate nations would be preferred . 
  salzburg is lovely , the cost of living is n't low but is n't as high as you 'd expect of a world class city . 
  lots of skiing and the women are 20/10, 
  the swiss ca n't hold themselves up in their mountains forever . 
  switzerland ca n't reap the benefits of being a member of the european community without making any of the concessions expected of a western & industrialized nation . 
  the arrogance and elitism of the swiss boggles the mind at times . 
  do n't worry , erdogan is making sure to match them stride for stride : /, 
  since when did greece become muslim ? 
  apparently schengen only applies to the wealthy eu nations . 
  if you 're making it such a black and white issue you 're inviting conflict . 
  i 'm in favor of a policy of cooperation where greek and turkish naval warships can sail side by side in the aegean and use the waters together . 
  i 'm sorry but turkey 's options to get warships from the black sea to the mediterranean is limited to one , through the aegean . 
  it 's greece who over the past several decades who 've tried to extend the sovereignty radius of their islands to the point where there is no navigable route from the bosphorus to the mediterranean .

  what a gaudy monstrous building . 
  no tact . 
  from a religion that forbids idolatry too . 
  the following criteria must all be considered in an evaluation process to differing weights . 
  education , * generally * speaking those who are more educated hold lesser ideological values . 
  social media activity . 
  mannerism and personality . 
  dress , if a family is being interviewed and the mother/wife/daughters are dressed in full body and face covering the husband and potential son ( if old enough , ~ 12 + ) should not be given status . 
  the possessions must be inspected and considered . 
  heck i 'd even consider the attitudes of the potential migrants toward locals . 
  humility and republicanism are the two most important virtues to look for in a migrant . 
  this careful vetting is a policy i 've been proposing for a while now . 
  its not heartless or irresponsible . 
  there are lots of good humble syrian people and there are lots of potential trouble-makers . 
  it 's the expensive slow route so naturally it 's the right but unpopular one . 
  it 's far easier and cheaper to make blanket policies . 
  nope tesla is cornerinng the luxury electric market .

  erdo , g\u00fclen , same shit different smell . 
  things would n't changed if the junta won , except they would 've been the one who purge . 
  cultural differences determine the assimilation of people , those people are islamist and have some weirdo nationalist sentiments . 
  they can easily adapted into arabic culture for example , but not western culture . 
  secular turks fit in like other europeans yes because the thing they value is secularism , personal freedom , not intervening other people 's life etc. 
  the jazz you know . 
  culturally closer to european culture therefore easy to integrate or assimilate . 
  they 're cultural muslims at best . 
  21st century vs 7th century .

  because the right of conquest . 
  in those days , converting or destroying the religious buildings were the most important way to show dominance . 
  we are talking about 15th century after all . . hagia sophia with its current form symbolise conquest of the city for the muslims . 
   hagia irene possible . 
   hagia sophia impossible . 
  both religious communities see the building as their own . 
  religious muslims are n't happy even when they see it museum . 
  i think the best solution for both camps to use it as a mosque in fridays , cathedral in sundays and museum in the rest of the days . 
  so ; * religious muslims are happy * religious christians are happy * seculars are not alienated because it 's still a museum * religious tourism will save the day . 
  just imagine the possible first day of use as mosque or cathedral . 
   what would happen if erdogan died .

   `` the terrorist is judged to have been planning to carry out a suicide bomb attack and carried out reconnaissance around the old parliament building and anitkabir , '' governor ercan topaca wrote on twitter , referring to the mausoleum of modern turkey 's founder mustafa kemal ataturk . 
   the suspect may have been targeting ceremonies to be held there on the oct. 29 anniversary of the turkish republic 's foundation or on nov. 10 to commemorate ataturk 's death , anadolu cited topaca as saying . 
  that 's really important and scary because millions will gather in ataturk 's mausoleum on republic day and ataturk 's death anniversary . 
  kudos to the police . 
  no , although all that stress and anxiety . 
  wow that 's horrible !,

  he 's purging his opponents from the state institutions . 
  he tried to purge secularists but people protested and they got their jobs back . 
  domestic policy and foreign policy is clearly different . 
  you can be a dictator to your people but your lifetime is determined by how good your foreign relations are . 
  he does n't want his opponents ( i.e. 
  secularists because his opponents from other ideologies are n't that much hardcore ) to get western support . 
  because neither side want to deal with syrians . 
  the people does n't want them at all and all want to send them elsewhere , add economic burden caused by them , add general economic problems caused by erdo govt , add terror threat , voil\u00e0 . 
  there were 2 alternatives for erdo to be done : first was to let them migrate europe , second was to create a safe-zone in syria and settle them in . 
  he tried the first option via refugee deal , failed . 
  now he 's trying the second one . 
  turkey does n't want anything . 
  as i said , it 's not about being in eu or not ; it does mean to declare to the world that we are allies of europeans & north americans . 
  i 'm not head of state so it 's pointless to ask my opinion on this issue but anyway . . that 's would be good for turkey and people would be in favour of it because current eu accession bid is pointless and both sides ( both people and government level ) know that turkey will never ever join eu . 
  this kind of alternative looks good . 
  european axis = / = being european . 
  turkey just declares that europe is her both economic and military allies by continuing the status-quo . 
  welfare and liberties attract people to immigrate . 
  if you really want europe to be unattractive place then all european countries should be like russia . 
  hmm , my friends study in journalism , education , literature .

  islamism is indeed a mental disorder . 
  eu will lose a lot because tr is a buffer zone for them eventhough they 're not aware of this situation . 
  if turkey ends to act like buffer zone , that means all that middle eastern mess will be a lot closer to them . 
  not to mention that information share about terrorists in syria & iraq or refugees in this country . 
  turkey will lose because it does n't mean an membership . 
  it 's an axis we are and we should belong to . 
  when the relation with europeans halted , all that efforts for years to make this country modern will also be halted .

  they will end him before he ends the process . 
  turkey is too important to lose to some wacky islamist . 
  turkey wo n't end the pretence . 
  erdo is a talk talk talk guy , not action . 
  he likes to talk , threaten , play the big guy role but he does n't do action . 
  eu accession bid is not for joining eu but to declare that turkey belongs to the european axis . 
  that 's what is important . 
  turkey still plays an important role between european countries and war-torn middle eastern countries , it provides a buffer zone to europe . 
  isolating the country from europe will hurt both sides even more . 
  it 's the reporter 's fault but i can not blame the people on the other thread for falling this because this is erdo we 're talking about , he can say anything . 
  summary of akp govt . 
   did this loosening up of rules have the support of turkish people ? 
  was there a big talk about it ? 
  which parties did support it in parliament ? 
  no , no and no . 
  the government brought up this thing all of a sudden . 
  to be fair , they always bring things up all of a sudden . 
  probably to kickstart the project . 
  maybe some other cities are included but yeah mostly \u0130zmir & ankara . 
  i do n't know which is funnier . 
  talking about europe to risk becoming irrelevant or this coming from canadian pm . 
  in the moment assad is gone , syria will be libya 2.0 . 
  he can not be replaced at least not via war . 
  assad is against qatar - syria - turkey pipeline project . 
  he prefers iran - iraq - syria pipeline .

russia hands down . 
  we were always fighting since they always wanted to go south , cold is boring they say . 
  now ? 
  they still invade us , this time with swimtrunks and they are fighting with not us but germans on beaches ... 
  turkey can not into love :'(, 
  soon ... 
  nope , islands control some airspace around them . 
  they cant have infinite airspace . 
  and that area looks like it doesnt have islands in it . 
  so its legal but rude and provocative . 
  well as a turkish it does look like provocation . 
  elections are approaching so attempt to steal a bit votes ? 
  and just saying , greece doesnt completely control airspace . 
  there are leaks between those islands . 
  we will probably exercise there and be legal but nonetheless its a stupid provocation . 
  you are right . 
  he knows how to control masses . 
  i hope we get rid of him asap . 
  we pick the guy who is there . 
  and surely government here wouldnt send a crazy guy to veto stuff this would decrease our prestige . 
  people here can still give one more push for eu if we do get in it will only increase more . 
  if we cant it will drop drastically . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i can reference all of my arguements . 
  dont blame me if you cant answer . 
  i only need one thing to show that its not genocide and i have done it already , wrstern armenians were nearly untouched . 
  however great the numbers are it still doesnt make genocide . 
  because genocide isnt all about numbers . 
  so your arguement is wrong but whatever you say you will keep on saying murderous , tyrannt turks . 
  this hatress 's roots go back to ottoman empire . 
  there are far more important genocide 's that other european countries committed . 
  take any empire throughout history . 
  usa who loves to bash us for that nearly completely eradicated their natives yet noone says anything . 
  this goes to the most important european countries . 
  ( england , france , spain , russia , ... ) why dont they accept theirs before getting mad to us ? 
  germans intentionally killed jews . 
  ottomans did not take them and filled them in gas chambers . 
  they rebelled and got relocated . 
  here watch this . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg70uwesfu4 or what about turkish genocide ( from your opinion it was a genocide ) in balkans ? 
  we lost about 6 million of turkish after we lost those lands in the first balkan war !, 
  nobody gives the slightest fuck . 
  you show yourselves as the pinnacle of civilizations yet you are covered with hyprocsy and this happened before the so called genocide and fueled hatress against non-muslims . 
  yet we are still appearantly the bloody killers !, 
  un decided that both bosnia and serbia committed genocides to eachother but they exempted from reperations because they were not done in modern day serbia and bosnia . 
  turkey is complete opposite of what ottoman was . 
  people who lived at that times are dead already . 
  holocaust was far worser than this ethnic cleansing and turkey will never cede terriyory even if it means war . 
  small reperations can be paid for the sake of good will but thats it . 
  armenia has bigger issues to resolve . 
  right now they are like a vassal under russians . 
  they are landlocked and borders are closed with turkey and azerbaijan . 
  if borders get open again they will benefit a lot from it . 
  dont get me wrong i want turkey to be in friendly terms of every country around us but i am dead sick of hatress against us . 
  we massacred kurds ? 
  really ? 
  if we had massacred them there wouldnt be such a huge amount of kurds here . 
  there was injustice against them which turkey was responsible of but there wasnt any massacres . 
  and well they will gain autonomy somehow down the road as i said . 
  we accept ethnic cleansing of east armenians . 
  genocide is a very heavy word that means wiping out the entire race wherever you spot them . 
  however in this case western armenians were nearly untouched and the eastern armenians were forced to deport but due to the collapsing empire situation was fucked up many armenians died . 
  i am not saying they are not responsible for their deaths but what do you expect from a country whose power can not reach beyond their capital ? 
  and a big mistake , this was done during ottoman regime , we are turkey , completely different and completely opposite . 
  so it wasnt our country who did that . 
  un proposed [ annan plan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/annan_plan_for_cyprus ) for cyprus but they rejected . 
  why are we always blamed about this issue ? 
  the reason we got there was to stop greeks from killing turkish cypriots . 
  i agree that it is not right to maintain turkish soldier there but we simply dont trust them and cant take risk that it will happen again . 
  those area must be defended . 
  kurds - many injustices were done to them - will probably get autonomy somehow , wish we could live as friends but it looks like its impossible now . 
  i voted for the main opposition party . 
  however this erdogan guy knows how to make people follow him . 
  yes the reward for being the worst president in republic of turkey goes to that cunt ... yet majority still votes him ... 
  you are wrong my friend . 
  greece and cyprus do want turkey to be in the eu . 
  because they are cautious against turkey even though a war between us will likely never happen . 
  if we get in a possible war risk will be so low that they can cut their military budgets . 
  unfortunately we cant because we are such in a damned ( or lucky ? ), 
  place . 
  the problem is france and germany , they simply do not want turkey and all those issues ( cyprus , kurds , armenians ... ) are for show only . 
  they are playing as if they want to get in to eu but they really dont . 
  unfortunately general opinion to eu is getting lower and lower and now they are not really even trying to hide that . 
  however still sometimes `` integration to eu laws '' do pass , but they dont really want it . 
  speaking for us this was a long dream since our foundation . 
  it would cause great turmoil if we were in the eu and some stupid politician quitted . 
  i mean firstly they really would not do that , people wouldnt let that happen but now its kind late ... 
  yea majority picked him . 
  i did not . 
  he doesnt fully represent turkey ... 
  as a turkish because of we are waited soooooo much the public opinion is going downwards for the eu anyway . 
  plus we are going backwards with this stupid islamist ignorant government of ours . 
  why havent you accepted earlier for gods sake ? 
  now we are being drawned in to the pitch black abyss called islam by every second . 
  getting in to eu would push us to the right western direction . 
  now people is like `` fuck them !, 
  we dont want them too if they dont want us , we can always be allied with eastern countries anyway !, 
  ( china , russia , india ... ) '' however i understand they dont want us . 
  population . 
  maybe they can alter their system for us ?

  europeans ca n't be unfair to us - we are being unfair to them by just existing . 
  so we have to make up for it by ignoring our national interests and becoming a constant dumping ground and a puppet state . 
  was n't morsi brotherhood democratically elected ? 
  was he actually a dictator or was he the standart western created `` i do n't like what this country is doing so i will associate it only with it 's leader who i will call a dictator . '', 
  type of dictator ? 
  the money has not been sent yet . 
  and no , you ca n't create great border protection with 3 billion euros . 
  anyway , turks do n't want this deal either . 
  what 's the point of this deal ? 
  it 's not beneficial for us in the slightest and all we do is get threatened , scrap it already we do n't need 3 million more islamists in our country . 
  be\u015fir and muhammet in turkish , we replace `` a '' with `` e '' when using arabic words and `` b '' with `` p '' most of the time . 
  for example , kebab is actually kebap in turkish , 
  which is still turkey . 
  let 's not discriminate , 
  because their coup failed and the turkish government is % 100 hostile to them right now . 
  see how some things make sense when you do n't run from every conspiracy theory because you are afraid of looking like a nut ? 
  i know right . 
  tends to happen when you are a bridge between nato and the middle east . 
  so this is not a false claim . 
  those are legitimate concerns but i think for most people it has gotten to the point of simply bashing turkey . 
   introducing death penalty would potentially be one it did n't happen and even if it did , it would n't be a fucked up thing . 
  the second one is fucked up yes ; but you ca n't blame the entire country for something like that . 
  come up with more i may be forgetting some other minor thing that does n't matter at all . 
  most of the `` fucked up '' stuff we did are made up . 
  give me examples i 'll explain one by one . 
  one thing that legitimately happened and is shitty : one female singer 's concerts were cancelled because she refused to attend the democracy rally . 
  that 's it . 
  erdogan has been absolutely pleasant after the coup attempt , for the first time i hate his supporters more than him . 
  yup that 's what i meant . 
  istanbul 's architecture is pretty ugly for the most part . 
  it 's a very clean city though , contrary to what most europeans think . 
  edit : grammar, 
  it will definitely get even better thanks to our joint projects and improved trade in the future . 
  yeah but the stupid amount of instability leads to people migrating outside the country , it 's to be expected . 
  they will hopefully come back in the future . 
  these people are using visas or green cards so relax . 
  because it goes against their interests , not because they want to prevent terrorism . 
  nobody is a good guy . 
  we have no interest in bullying armenia , azerbaijan does . 
  governments do n't go after others because they `` hate '' them . 
  edit : grammar, 
  putin and erdogan talked about this live ; but it 's not a `` joint defense plan '' it 's % 99 going to be intelligence sharing as nato wo n't allow a joint defense plan with russia ( or any other country . ), 
  they also got supported by us ; because they are not pkk . 
  3 , iraq does n't exist . 
  syria is weak , we 've gotten weaker . 
  eh ... not really . 
  http://www.businessinsider.com/us-soldiers-ypg-patches-syria-2016-5 us is incredibly unpopular here . 
  russia is n't that unpopular especially because we are somewhat used to our russian neighbors . 
  the rumors flying around that russian intelligence helped erdogan foil the coup plan turned everything around , now our citizens probably like russia more than any other country on earth . 
  nationalism, 
  yeah , for comparison our dip will be way worse i am pretty sure . 
  fyi memers : brain health = / = intelligence . 
  looks like an economic growth map , besides germany ? 
  i explained how in one of my previous posts [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4wfsj0/austrian_farright_leader_likens_turkish_coup_to/d66qzj0 ), 
  this is the only thing in 15 years that the secular turks agree with erdogan on . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/what-the-western-media-doesnt-seem-to-get.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=101983&amp;newscatid=411 ) is an article from an opposition news source . 
  maybe your media is n't as biased as bbc or cnn ; but that does n't matter because your state does n't matter and just goes along with the nato narrative on everything . 
  and yes the turkish media is n't free ; but we at least got different opinions in the media on foreign policy issues instead of all the media lining up behind the government on everything like in the us . 
  edit : poster above changed his tone by editing so i did the same . 
  provide me with proof that this purge has anything to do with kemalism being snuffed out . 
  so far the opposite has happened and the kemalists got more positions in every government institution , replacing the gulenists . 
  this might surprise you : but we know who is who here . 
  we know which newspaper is gulenist , which hospital is gulenist , which schools or charter schools are gulenists and now after the coup also which army generals are gulenists . 
  but in turkey if you use it as an insult you might get arrested . 
  and you know the reality better because when your media only gives you 3 pieces of the entire context that 's real journalism ? 
  i am surprised it 's so low, 
  turkish authorities did say they needed support ; that does n't mean it was their response when asked to give proof . 
  there is plenty of proof available , including dozens of confessions and ex leaders of the gulenist movement helping the government battle the movement . 
  the documents are already sent to the us government , they are not made public because we are n't russia so we are n't trying to convince anyone besides the governments of countries . 
  yes . 
  i understand why they seem like a very convenient scapegoat ; but the facts are out there ( just not in the western media . ), 
  ok , besides the fact that gulen wants to turn turkey into an islamic state ruled by him as the supreme leader ; here is a small example : turkey 's biggest military hospital is called gata . 
  one very successful professor in gata was working on schizophrenia and addictive minds . 
  right now you need medication for your entire life to treat schizophrenia ; but he was doing good progress at finding out a permanent cure for the disease ... until he randomly got prisoned by gulenists during the ergenekon trials for `` plotting a coup '' when he has nothing to do with the military at all . 
  why ? 
  because gulenists do n't give 0 shits about turkey , they only care about islam and intentionally hold turkey from making progress in any area . 
  except , the us media did n't make false news like `` hitler ran away to great britain '' during the reichstag fire . 
  right ? 
  that 's not all that happened + millions of people pouring into streets is a very strong deterrent . 
  he is not my lord and master , not every person who loves turkey loves erdogan . 
  whataboutism is a form of distraction , `` yes i did that ; but you did this ! '', 
  when someone criticizes you for doing something when they are also doing it and you point it out , it 's not called whataboutism it 's called exposing the hypocrisy . 
  it 's not whataboutism , the two actions are the same thing . 
  you do n't seem to understand how whataboutism works . 
  because eu does n't do any of that . 
  keep believing in fairy tales about how the west does n't use terrorism as a part of their foreign policy to expand their powers ; but instead focuses on destroying them completely because they kill less people than broken glasses do in a year . 
  it is very possible that as soon as there is a good eastern alternative to the west , we will abandon the west . 
  for that reason they will never fully commit to being our friends ; but instead be `` allies . '', 
  he will die before he is returned , which is probably convenient for some peeps . 
  fuck this cunt . 
  that 's because turkey is a nato ally and that 's what nato does , harbor and arm terrorists and use them for benefit to be able to weaken countries like yours through geopolitical ways . 
  the reason the world knows of our terrorism support a little better is because the gulenists leaked it . 
  the us just did n't like it when we became close with russia and china a little bit so they decide to create a kurdistan corridor south of our borders so we can become less influential as that corridor would be another really convenient gateway between the east and the mediterranean sea . 
  this is what happens when there is one sole world leader , that leader starts punishing it 's own allies if they are not playing % 100 by their rules . 
  yes ; but he for sure is n't going to make a referandum on `` do you forgive erdogan ? '', 
  he will just assume that we do . 
  ( we do n't ), 
  i think probably all of our southeast kurds responded no to this question . 
  the west is n't honestly trying to end terrorism completely ; but we are n't either . 
  nobody is , besides russia .

  these are obvious lies from a system many of us do not trust any more . 
  they seemed all pretty chill guys, 
  i dont know how popular he is now . 
  he used to be powerful , but the media and the enterprises controlled by his movement have been seized by the government . 
  key people have been imprisoned , forced to leave turkey or rendered harmless . 
  i dont think he can influence the vote of his followers . 
  i doubt he claimed to be a prophet , that sounds like propaganda from erdo\u011fan 's side . 
  it was opened by the g\u00fclenists when the turkish government seized their newspaper . 
  their articles are very reliable , but they have an anti-erdo\u011fan agenda . 
  and dead . 
  please dont upvote this . 
  this is last week 's new , a minor incident , and this guy has said worse , namely he thinks people from abroad are actively trying to kill erdo\u011fan with telekinesis ( mentioned in the article ), 
  his origins lie in the islamic party . 
  there are always \u0130slamists that find other \u0130slamists wrong though . 
  al qaeda hates isis for example . 
  - the akps stronghold is not istanbul . 
  https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:turkish_general_election,_november_2015_ ( akp ) . png - * `` 80 % of it votes for either the islamists , kemalists or the grey wolves . 
  '' * the three parties you implied are the three largest parties , with a total share of 85 % in turkey . 
  cihangir , where the attack happened , is the most progressive neighbourhood in \u0130stanbul . 
  most westerners live there , many artists and leftists too . 
  we have sacrifices in islam . 
  while she was the interior minister , she warned a mafia boss of his imminent arrest . 
  the mafia boss run away . 
   ak\u015fener joined her centre-right true path party ( dyp ) , before switching to the ultranationalist mhp in 2007 following the decline of the dyp . 
  she joined akp , erdo\u011fan 's newly founded party , in 2001 . 
  a few months later she joined mhp , the nationalists . 
   as interior minister , she once referred to pkk leader abdullah \u00d6calan as `` armenian offspring , '' a remark for which she later apologised . 
  her apology was : i didnt mean the armenians who live in turkey , i meant the armenians as a race/nation . 
  doesnt make any difference . 
  even if his diploma is fake , no court will force him to quit . 
  and nobody can convice erdo\u011fan supporters either , so no image damage . 
  we should stop losing our time with this issue . 
  - they dont come from the same political tradition . 
  ckmp comes from the demokrat parti . 
  t\u00fcrke\u015f founded the conservative party ( muhafazakar parti ) after the coup , which was later renamed to mhp . 
  they sometimes cooperated with the conservatives ( 1991 with refah , for example ) - they are not secular . 
  they are not as conservative as akp , but closer to akp than chp . 
  survey from 2015 http://imgur.com/0ccwfd2 http://m.imgur.com/lhruyml - you are right about the education level , but this is not a political criterion http://m.imgur.com/8c7t6ah, 
  why did you add the islamist-nationalists ( mhp ) and the seculars ( chp ) in one group ? 
  the map shows which party won the majority in each province . 
  most people understand this . 
  many europeans think that istanbul has a secular majority , or that turkey is divided in half , a secular block in the west and erdo\u011fan in the east . 
  this map helps breaking down these misconceptions . 
  set of maps with the results per party : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_general_election,_november_2015#nationwide_results, 
  election results map : http://secim.haberler.com yellow : erdo\u011fan red : seculars purple : kurds, 
  they are `` exploited children '' as you said , they are victims . 
  what are the differences between eea , efta and customs union ? 
  were they mocking the scammers or the victims here ? 
  i understand but i dont think this is reasonable at all . 
  `` come and work in germany for 10 years '' is different to `` you are allowed to visit germany for 30 days '', 
  dont worry , i dont think bicycles use the lane . 
  it just looks nice for the election brochure . 
  ` in the last 4 years , we built 140km of bicycle lanes ', 
  why are europeans against visa-free travel from turkey ? 
  you may dislike/hate erdo\u011fan , islamists or refugees , but this arangement will allow us to stay a few days and then we , turks , will have to leave . 
  it is not a residency or work permit , it is just a 30 day visa-free holiday . 
  the majority of the turks who will visit europe are upper-middle class , educated , secular western turks . 
  what can i do ? 
  i vote , i go to protests and demonstrations . 
  we shouldnt start posting about the nationalists , otherwise / r/europe will be overwhelmed . 
  but since you started : turkish nationalists protesting in front of the german embassy , claiming there was no genocide and shouting `` a dead armenian is a good armenian '' to prove their claims . 
  [ cochineal insect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cochineal ) is used since the antiquity to make [ carmine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carmine ) , a red food dye . 
  i carry that flag in my heart , c\u00eewan . 
  why do you have a star next to your name ? 
  all * these * officials , including the president , the prime minister and some ministers . 
  a couple of years ago , someone wanted to boycott israel . 
  he bought all the cocacola and fanta from a market , opened them and spilled them down the drain : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibtqcp2cuss, 
  cahil , not functional illiterates . 
  - isis from syria killed at least 21 people in turkey : http://kentgazetesi.biz/kiliste-olu-sayisi-21e-yukseldi/ - the homegrown isis sympathisers were in isis in syria before : http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/dokumacilar-suriyeye-gecerken-devlet-onlari-dinliyormus-1453585/ the kurds are persecuted every day . 
  you live abroad and are a nationalist , but if you want to be honest with yourself here are some examples : - the kurdish party was not allowed to hold a meeting 2 days ago in \u0130zmir , a western city : http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/hdp-izmirde-miting-gerceklestiremedi-toplanti-yapti-40113234 - the kurds were not allowed to celebate their new year : http://www.milliyet.com.tr/istanbul-da-nevruz-kutlamasina-gundem-2210784/, 
  the explosion today was in the center of istanbul , close to the grand bazaar , one of the largest touristic attractions . 
  - give kurds equal rights so that they dont resort to terrorism . 
  - let ypg close the border to block isis from entering turkey . 
  - keep a religion-friendly/moderate muslim government to appease the local islamists . 
  - dont meddle in foreign countries ( by supporting islamists in syria for example ) . 
  there is a map in the link above . 
  the west coast and the european part of turkey votes secular . 
  southeast votes kurdish . 
  the rest votes erdo\u011fan . 
  - a car bomb exploded at 8:40 in the morn\u0131ng . 
  - the explosion took place in a busy neighbourhood , close to the grand bazar and istanbul university . 
  - at least 11 dead ( 7 of them policemen ) and 36 injured . 
  both of these facts are disputed . 
  the south-east of turkey , where kurds live , is underdeveloped . 
  we dont really have statistics about the fertility rate based on ethnicity , since ethnicity is not officialy recorded . 
  we have statistics about regions , and we know which region is kurdish - or turkish-majority . 
  they could put you in jail before ( [ article 301 - wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_301_of_the_turkish_penal_code ) ) and it has been softened in 2008 . 
  the target are not tourists , but journalists , kurds , the opposition , leftists . 
  i doubt a tourist was ever jailed or fined for this . 
  ebru umar , mentioned below , is a journalist who also carries the turkish citizenship . 
  no freedom of press , oppression of minorities , persecution of leftists are legitimate reasons to boycott turkey . 
  putting tourists in prison is not . 
  edit : fixed link, 
   the eu , along with russia , must support christian armenia as it is surrounded by hostile islamic states : turkey , azerbaijan , and iran . 
  russia and \u0130ran are friendly towards both armenia and azerbaijan . 
  iran is not hostile towards armenia . 
  a bad economy will put a lot of pressure on erdo\u011fan , but i do not want my countrymen to suffer . 
  - the personal cult around erdo\u011fan reached these levels after gezi , in 2013 . 
  many people realise it and feel very uncomfortable . 
  - there is a narrative that predates erdo\u011fan .

god no !, 
  european demands do n't fit the reality of middle east . 
  implementing eu laws and protocols will turn turkey into a cucked dysfunctional hippy state . 
  we are surrounded with wars and terrorism . 
  and with strict adherence to western laws , we would be crushed by anyone in the middle east . 
  turkey should show middle finger to eu , abolish the laws which we implemented for the hope of accession , and turn back to our roots . 
  these people has no spine . 
  they used to be the biggest erdogan supporters . 
  lol ... 
  the man who runs this newspaper is an islamist preacher . 
  he has shady ties with u.s. during cold war u.s funded his organisation against the spreading of communism . 
  and from 2002 to 2012 he had great ties with erdogan but because of some monetary issues he became the biggest opposition of erdogan . 
  he currently lives in pennsylvania , us . 
  and despite the requests american authorities do n't hand him over to turkey . 
  if turkey is turning into a shithole because of incompetent leaders , g\u00fclen movement has huge responsibility . 
  the eu should pay for the migrants and refugees to fly to europe . 
  it would be more efficient and more humane . 
  europe has the means and the money . 
  get on it europe . 
  fsa is almost non-existent , there are just various islamist groups which us approaches with suspicion . 
  and ypg would n't fight a strong russian-backed assad . 
  they have been cannon fodders against isis , because in the end they would grab some land and become famous . 
  they got what they want , they grabbed the land , they became famous . 
  they wo n't risk their gains just because some american chickenhawks want to remove russian-iranian influence in syria . 
  eventually ypg may even fight against american interests in the future . 
  they are communalists . 
  idelologically they are against every value us holds . 
  but today they need us for survival . 
  i genuinely believe american foreign policy makers are ultimate morons . 
  we must be all thanking nato & us for fucking up the middle east and north africa . 
  just think about the backlash if turkish coast guard had de-infliated the refugee boats belong to syrians ... 
  but it 's ok when europeans do it , lol . 
  baww , turkish police ruin their rights to possess rpgs and anti-tank mines . 
  without 2nd amendment rights kurds will never be free !!, 
  us does n't have allies but interests . 
  erdogan made a very brave move by denying to be cannon fodders for cleaning the mess us has caused , of course they will forge some evidence to make him look bad . 
  eh , [ turks were fighting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman%e2%80%93wahhabi_war ) against wahhabi lunatics since their very existence , these people were in check , they were near their extinction . 
  french and british decided to give them a state , gees , how things turned out now ... 
  however , there are also secondary reasons why isis exists today but still us has the big responsibility . 
  their de-baathification policy in iraq was destined for doom , they thought they can pull the same stunt which mcarthur did in post-war japan , in a non-industrialized nation full of tribes and different minorities , they treated iraq as a homogenous entity - except kurdish parts . 
  they ignited a sectarian war . 
  maybe it was part of their grand plan , us foreign policy makers are known to start wars . 
  but still us has no right to point fingers to others as if they are not responsible for things going wrong in the middle east . 
  and americans ( there are many americans on this website ) are roused to believe the most illogical , hfcs-fueled fantasies to fight for the interests of their masters . 
  show these people an `` enemy '' and they 'll start barking and biting right away , point them another way , with a completely different story , and they 'll be howling that way . 
  these people were chanting taliban strong , kills evil communists and a decade later sending their sons off to afghanistan ... 
  there is no need for demagogy , asking for rights and asking for land are quite different things . 
  i 'm sure europeans and americans would treat their minorities differently if they were fighting for land and a seperate state , as we already witness in eastern europe . 
  us invasion of iraq is the main reason why there is an isis today . 
  they are just trying to blame others for their own failure . 
  so , for the russians , leaving their homes in baltic states and ukraine is an obligation , but kurds must stay so they have their own country , meanwhile they have other options like living in iran , iraq ( krg ) , syria or seeking asylum in an european country . 
  nice double standards m8 . 
  probably you also have never been there too , why do you care ? 
  your logic is total non-sense . 
  why does n't us give land to hispanics and blacks , why does n't europeans give lands to their minorities ? 
  what do you think about ukraine , baltic states and finland giving lands to russians ? 
  eh , it 's the western propaganda mate , mystification at its finest , they write the story like as if turkey had donated some nuclear dirty bomb to isis ... 
  but in reality the `` usb drives '' they found in the middle of syria has some information about isis selling oil to turkey . 
  and even i can plant some fake evidence in some random usb drives . 
  you miss the part that pkk attacks turkey . 
  turkey is quite indifferent to pkk-ypg 's fight against isis . 
  and sorry , i do n't believe american stories . 
  us has a bad habit of fraudulently concealing economic and geostrategic purposes of foreign intervention . 
  sinking of uss maine in 1898 , gulf of tonkin incident , the reason for invading grenada and panama , iraqi wmds were all hoaxes . 
  i do n't believe anything coming from us . 
  i do n't even believe that there has been a raid on isis cell in the middle of syria , where americans captured some usb drives . 
  undeniable like the iraqi wmds ? 
  right ? 
  you are obviously an anti-turkish racist skinhead who only has minimal information about pkk and turkey , but you like the pkk terrorists because they are attacking us . 
  now you can go back to your skinhead dreams where hitler saves europe . 
  there is no need to have a reasonng with these skinheads like / u/lemontolha , they will always come up with stupid reasons how turks deserve to be killed in terror attacks . 
  just think about the shitstorm if turkish parliament had invited an isis commander to give speech to parliament members , just one day before paris attacks ... 
  but when europeans do it , it 's fine ... 
  french would n't mourn for turkish people died in terror attacks ... 
  furthermore , their government supports pkk terrorists . 
  mourning for french in turkey is the dumbest thing ever . 
  fortunately our people in stadium showed the right reaction . 
  also you are a funny guy , you were trying to justify pkk 's suicide attacks directed at turks and now you talk about decency and understanding . 
  now the terrorism which you love hit you . 
  and you cry foul ... keep crying bitch . 
  islamists also fight an independence war in hope they can draw their own borders in france . 
  you should understand them and stop calling them terrorists . 
  when was the last time french mourned for turkish people died in terror attacks ? 
  i do n't remember such an instance . 
  but french government supports pkk terrorists against turkey and even in this thread french people justify pkk 's terror attacks directed at turks . 
  at such circumstances , that 's just a normal reaction . 
  mourning french in turkey is a dumb idea . 
  leftists and secular lost , that 's a good day to be humble . 
  fascist ? 
  that 's so unoriginal mate . 
  btw you reminded me even an obvious terrorist supporter like you can claim moral high ground anyhow , and being anti-turkish and talking about the sake of turks at the same time is possible if you have no shame . 
  reddit keeps suprising me everytime . 
  thanks for caring about turks . 
  it 's really appreciated . 
  your love of turks and turkey really brought tears to my eyes . 
  next time when pkk terrorists kills a turk , i 'll remember that they are killing us just because how much they care about goodwill and sake of turkish people . 
  as expected you have no dignity or whatsoever . 
  i 'd not expect much from a terrorist group supporter like you . 
  you have used pkk flair for a very very long time and you posted to justify pkk 's suicide bombings against turkish people . 
  but still it 's quite funny for a staunchly anti-turkish person , you still has the face to tell what 's better for turks .

  demir 4 . 
  aslan/arslan ( aslan is more common though ) weird thing is i 've seen ayd\u0131n ( enlightened , intellectual ) surnamed people more than y\u0131lmaz . 
  but still most of the surnames here edgy , our pm 's surname is y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m ( thunder ) , mine is barut ( gunpowder ) , there are lots of \u015eahin ( hawk ) , do\u011fan ( falcon ) surnamed people . 
  i did n't watch the semi finals this year but i thought you guys liked him before that . 
  but that 's not the real islam !, 
  mosques are only buildings , they ca n't be extremist or decent . 
  instead of punishing or firing the extremist people working in mosques , trying to close them ... how is that even a solution ? 
  you know , that 's why people hate the usa . 
  mostly by helping them . 
  same way with other cults . 
  they help them , make them think that gulenists are all good guys , they recruit them . 
  it 's not rocket science and they were n't hiding it . 
  oh and of course there are some gulen supporters just to gain a position or to get rich . 
  some of them are like that while some of them are innocent and gets manipulated . 
  in my high school years they tried to recruit me too . 
  i was n't even a muslim so i did n't care a single bit however a friend of mine joined them . 
  last i heard of him he was appointed as a teacher in a gulenist private school right after he finished the university . 
  i do n't know what happened to him and i do n't care . 
  you see , if you pursue power through unjust ways you need to be prepared to get purged . 
   pkk does n't do terrorism because it 's fun . 
  yeah it 's a known fact that most of the eu leaders are actually muslim . 
  that 's really smart dude . 
  you should totally go for the politics career , i 'm sure you 'd make middle east the most peaceful place on the earth with these ideas . 
  10-15 years ago it was a serious thing but recently it 's kind of a joke . 
  people here see joining to the shangai five more possible than joining to the eu . 
  is it good ? 
  i 'm looking for a good anime since a while , saw paprika but could n't bring myself to watch it . 
  russia defense companies also do their work and i 'm pretty sure that their tech is better than ours since they actually have a long weapon and armed vehicle crafting experience . 
  in a complete war we would eventually lose without the support of nato or the western world because war is more about the sustainable economy and without the western support for us , russia has the upper hand . 
  but we do n't live in the medieval world anymore and there is something called nationalism . 
  and as you know we turks are one of the most nationalist countries in the world so even if we lose the war there is little to none gains for russia there considering the resources they would spend to fund the war . 
  we know this , the russians know this , i do n't know why people still talk about a imaginary war between russia and turkey . 
  we are waiting until the day erdogan dies or some kind of miracle happens and the people here starts to see what kind of a person he is . 
  until then unfortunately we are unable to do anything . 
  the thing is that democracy can be the bane of a country if there are uneducated/ignorant people as much as the educated ones . 
  a weird but good example for that would be the brexit vote . 
   vapaa vankka vakaa sounds great when you pronounce it in turkish . 
   that 's because `` i 'm going '' and `` i go '' usually exist as a single form in other languages partly correct for us . 
  present tense exists in turkish but we use continous tense even when common sense would require present tense . 
  for example , `` i am going to school every day ( her g\u00fcn okula gidiyorum ) '' and `` i go to school every day ( her g\u00fcn okula giderim ) '' both are perfectly fine in turkish , but the latter sounds like something from a 50-60s movie . 
  feels good to be compared to the uk instead of saudi arabia once in a while ... 
  now i 'm all teary ... 
  good . 
  let 's hope that whole europe follows the examples of the netherlands and germany . 
  it 's been enough that you guys put up with erdogan 's shit . 
  yeah well with the corruption that has been going on here they might as well not give citizenship and yet make them vote yes . 
   adieu brilliant . 
  at least it looks really nice . 
  try going there every summer ... every summer i feel like \u0130zmir is the hottest place on the earth before i go to silifke for vacation . 
  when i return to \u0130zmir it feels nice and cold . 
  hopefully russian response will be as interesting as this one . 
  this one never fails to crack me up, 
  i think you just killed him . 
  that 's so 90s man , blaming it on germans is where it 's at right now . 
   iirc more than half of the exports was in the hands of armenians , a large number of publishing houses were armenian owned , etc i do n't really remember the numbers but you are correct that most of the business during ottoman empire were in the hands of armenians , jews and greeks . 
  that 's probably the reason why most of them did n't leave after the genocide since there are still lots of armenians , jews , greeks living in istanbul . 
   can you imagine a turkey today with an armenian dominated business and economy class rendering a stronger armenian elite than a turkish one ? 
  i think that 's not possible . 
  sure , armenians would start much more ahead . 
  but the main reason why non-muslims were more succesful businessman then muslims is that their education was better . 
  during the 19th century ottomans finally started to give a few fucks about their people 's well being and they built some modern schools for muslims too . 
  before that huge majority of muslims did n't even get education . 
  iirc less than % 10 of the population was able to read and write and most of those people were non-muslims . 
  there is a reason why literature developed in the ottomans only in the later half of 19th century and not before . 
  not to discredit armenians , do n't get me wrong . 
  or any other ethnicity . 
  turks were n't interested in modern stuff , they were n't interested in getting an education and they were content with the way they were . 
  also most of the modernism attempts by turks were blocked by \u015eey\u00fclislam ( minister of islam or smth ) . 
  they were n't able to operate a bank because interest is considered haram . 
  after 1923 education and modernism ( secularism , woman rights etc. ), 
  was the main priority of the new republic but even then most people did n't let their kids to get even primary education . 
   well turkish also alludes to an ethnicity and probably is one of the reasons for the many problems this has caused . 
  in english when we refer to our ethnicity we use turk usually and when we refer to our citizenship we use turkish . 
  but in turkish both are the same so yeah that caused problems , especially with kurdish seperate movement . 
  recently many people tend to use `` t\u00fcrk vatanda\u015f\u0131 '' meaning `` turkish citizen '' to refer to citizenship to be more pc but it 's not common enough yet . 
  answer a : first country with turk in it 's name was founded , g\u00f6kt\u00fcrk ( turkic ) khanagate . 
  we fought with chinese , expanded our borders [ from mongolia to black sea . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkic_khaganate ) they were overthrown by another turkic tribe , uyghurs but they left something very precious : orkhon inscriptions , the first written record of turkish and our only turkish record of what our ancestors were up to . 
  answer b : goddamn byzantium why you no fall, 
  i do n't know man i think germany will definitely will win this war , we should fight besides them so that we make balkans great again !, 
  when it snows in izmir we consider it as a cold winter . 
  dude is on fire !, 
  so , what you are saying is that their fate was inevitable and all they did was to fight against that but it ended up as fastening their end ? 
  there are proofs about what talat , enver and cemal pashas said but even then i think what you 're saying sounds too extreme as those proofs are from 1915 and not before . 
  you need to provide more evidence for this claim because `` they were in favor of a turkish state '' does n't cut it since atat\u00fcrk was also in favor of such a state but he did n't carry out any genocides against any nation . 
  in my own opinion , the three pashas were so idealist ( panturkism up to a point of racism ) that they caused harm to everyone including turks living under ottoman empire . 
  but even then what you 're suggesting seems too extreme to me . 
   well defined turkish nation turkish nation is n't well defined , even now . 
  we are citizens of turkey republic but that 's all . 
  there are kurds , laz people , georgians , assyrians , armenians , greeks , syrians , arabs , bulgarians etc. 
  living here . 
  our approachs on this subject is that as long as someone calls himself turkish he is turkish . 
  there is a saying of atat\u00fcrk on this matter `` ne mutlu t\u00fcrk ' \u00fcm diyene ! '', 
  meaning `` how happy is the one who says i am a turk/turkish ! '' . 
  maybe it sounds racist but as we are all turkish it 's actually not . 
  you misinterpreted the analogy , it does n't really matter though because i do n't get what you 're trying to prove . 
  i did n't deny the genocide , i did n't call armenians the only responsible for that . 
  what ottomans did was logical up until it went extreme and became a movement of killing as many christians as possible not only armenians but assyrians too . 
  what ottomans did was triggered by the armenians because ottomans were in a lethal war during that time and can you really imagine them to genocide a nation for no reason at all while they 're fighting for their country 's life ? 
  what do you really expect from the ottomans , just give up their lands to armenians without doing anything ?

  for those who might not know what dershanes are ) , private schools . 
  parents have to send their kids to private schools because the public school system has been completely destroyed . 
  i am aware turkish public schools do not require tuition . 
  nah its the same for most women , particularly for foreigners for whatever reason turks think they are ` easier ' . 
  its not that they arent teaching them anything but imagine having a really devout muslim as your biology teacher . 
  how much do you think you 'll learn in that class or how much will that teacher push those kids to learn more ? 
  its not whats being taught thats the problem , public schools arent teaching sharia law all of a sudden ( although the number of hours of religious education has increased over the years ) . 
  the problem is the teachers and principles at the schools . 
  more and more are being replaced with religious nutjobs and that religious ideology is being imposed on the students in one way or another . 
  oh and more and more schools are being converted to \u0130mam hatip schools ( religious schools ) . 
  you hear a lot about parents whose kids go to a regular school one year and all of a sudden it turns in an \u0130mam hatip the next and they cant send their kid elsewhere because most public schools are full to begin with anyway . 
  so now they are literally forcing people to go to these religious schools . 
  so youre left with either going to an \u0130mam hatip , hoping some other school will take you , or spending 30-40k . 
  choice is yours . 
  god help you if you have a second child . 
  my colleague has two both will start school in the next 2 years or so . 
  im guessing her family are billionaires how else are you going to get your children a decent education in the middle east ? 
  let me know when your public school system turns into a completely religious one and you have to spend 30k euros to send your child to a school that wont guarantee him/her a great education but a normal non brainwashing one . 
  obviously people dont pay 30.000 euros here , they pay 30.000 tl but it means both parents need to working where one is only working for tuition ( plus costs associated with schooling ) . 
  think in terms of percentages . 
  average yearly salary in turkey is $ 10.000 which $ 9.000 roughly . 
  for example my manager at work sends her kid to a school that costs roughly 40.000 tl . 
  she probably makes around 100ktl per year . 
  so at least 40 % of her salary is going to tuition plus other costs that are associated . 
  we are the lucky few . 
  90 % of kids in this country go to shitty public schools and apart from some miracle stories you 'll hear every now and again none of them have any future whatsoever . 
  its one thing to use religion as a tool to gain votes , but its a little different than using it to shape a countrys future . 
  thats my point i think the pc crowd went from being a majority to thankfully a minority . 
  were talking post 9/11 ( or post iraq war lets say ) early-mid 00 's where the slightest criticism of islam or a muslim would get you branded an islamophobe before you could even finish saying islamophobe . 
  its also the reason of right wing politics in europe today . 
  people are slowly giving up politically correctness and starting to question the true intentions of a large group of muslims . 
  remeber the term `` moderate muslims '' . 
  erdo\u011fan and co were all labeled as `` moderate muslims '' by western media . 
  no one ever dared to question the reason why a group of people that believes in a certain religion had to be split into `` moderates '' and `` extremists '' . 
  europe , or rather the west , learned the hard way that theres no such thing as `` moderate '' muslim . 
  a devout muslim can not and will not ever be `` moderate '' . 
  this . 
  some europeans make the mistake of underestimating the g\u00fclen movement just because erdo\u011fan has labeled them as boogeymen and obviously dont believe him because who the fuck would trust erdo\u011fan . 
  the reality is the g\u00fclen movement is just as dangerous if not more dangerous than the akp . 
  the akp is a political party that will inevitably die out . 
  the g\u00fclen movement is a cult that infiltrates the government and private companies and does so in complete secret . 
  next thing you know you 're being fired because they want to replace you with someone that is more inline with their objectives . 
  and the next company you apply for wont hire you because the hr manager is a g\u00fclenist . 
  all of a sudden youre stuck with your university degree that you worked hard for while people from g\u00fclen schools are being favoured over you . 
  both the g\u00fclen cult and the akp need to go . 
  we are not picking between one or the other . 
  real turks are vehemently against both . 
  im very happy to see g\u00fclenists go to jail . 
  what im not happy with is everyone being labeled as g\u00fclenists left right and center and the fact we all know none of them will receive a fair trial . 
  ( regardless of whether or not i think they are guilty ), 
  politically correctness will allow for the most barbaric of acts to not be questioned . 
  its cancer . 
  have you ever lived in the middle east ? 
  theres a lot of anti-jewish rhetoric . 
  just go and talk to a few `` regular '' people store owners , taxi drivers etc. 
  ( speaking for turkey but i cant imagine it being too different in other parts of the region ), 
  the schools arent important when you have religion shoved down your throat every time you go home . 
  these non integrated families probably dont watch german tv , they watch turkish channels over satellite . 
  they watch the same sort propaganda and anti-whatever rhetoric that is being pushed down peoples throat 24/7 just like the people in turkey . 
  how are you supposed to overcome your prejudices when your parents from a very young age label people who eat pork as disgusting and jews as non human ? 
  schooling is important im not arguing this . 
  but i feel the way your family raises has more of an impact on who you become more than schooling does . 
  its a rinse and repeat cycle . 
  like i said these kids are 2nd and even 3rd generation german turks that are still acting like this . 
  clearly the education system alone isnt enough to solve these sort prejudice that comes from religion . 
  families are just as important . 
  i feel like their muslim identity overpowers their turkish/arab identity . 
  we 're talking about people who are racist purely because of their beliefs . 
  turks and arabs do not have any issues with jews . 
  but muslims do . 
  didnt mean to come off that harsh , my bad . 
   my point is that we should focus on the school . 
  without out a doubt , yes . 
  but the question is do they give education the same value to you and i do ? 
  in turkey that is not the case . 
  a presidential candidate was made fun of for knowing 5 languages ( is he running for president or translator , lol ) and our president himself has made statements along the lines of `` may allah protect us from those who have read ( educated ) '' after the 15th of july coup when akp campaign manager was killed . 
  then you have families pulling their children out of school because the boys need to make money and the girls ... well im not going to really get into that one . 
  i understand that this may be the case in turkey and might not apply to the turks in germany but islamists are islamists everywhere . 
  turks in germany have been there for 40-50 years and we still talk about integration . 
  i personally believe that they can not be taught without the influence of islam removed from their lives . 
  i didnt claim that they represented all muslims . 
  just a sizable portion that isnt small enough to be ignored anymore . 
  whats your point exactly ? 
  that its not only the islamic crowd that harassing them so we should let it slide ? 
  or that i shouldnt criticize them because there are others doing it as well ? 
  who cares if theyre refugees or not its irrelevant to the topic . 
  drop the pc bullshit . 
  what do you mean source ? 
  my point was that we keep using terms like `` a small portion '' , `` some '' , `` a small minority '' etc. 
  every time an incident happens like this and i feel like its starting to add up . 
  and against the left wing `` guys i swear theyre super peaceful '' narrative . 
  theyre akp supporters , what else would they be . 
  especially if theyre crazy enough to be stabbing people . 
  were talking about akp supporters . 
  she should glad she didnt get her head cut off . . 
  and yet they were calling the netherlands fascists for not letting them spread their lies but they have yet to say anything about america regarding the laptop ban and now this . 
  im guessing they dont want to bite off more than they can chew . 
  trump might be a bit too much for turkey to handle . . 
  i keep hearing this but where do you draw the line ? 
  he keeps pushing the limits knowing there will be no consequences apart from articles like this which means nothing to him .

  h ` wat  before taking its modern form , as mentioned in ottoman travel books of the 18th century , the doner used to be a horizontal stack of meat rather than vertical , probably sharing common ancestors with the ca\u011f kebab\u0131 of the eastern turkish province of erzurum .

  `` i just think that we should like deport everyone i do n't like what how dare you tell me it 's wrong muh free speech '', 
   kebab has nothing to do with islam false , it is holy food . 
  muhammad ate it a lot in his campaigns thus making it holy , this is why you can eat kebab in ramazan and not break your fast .

  we kind of talk about everywhere outside of anatolia as a separate entity ( yes , even turks outside of anatolia ) that might as well be in other planets .

  i would say west/east europe fits us too .

  you start throwing tantrums and calling names when you encounter a view that you disagree with and i 'm the piece of shit . 
  actually i like to hang out with my boy adolf . 
  slobo is weak shit you hear me, 
  yeah , slither away . 
  [ we caught more than 800 is members . 
  ] ( http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/1.615352 )  and people wonder why there 's a `` terrorist '' organization . 
  great fucking logic there . 
  uh yeah , what the fuck are you expecting ? 
  `` guys guys they 've killed enough of us let 's do what they want '' which literally no power would do .

then they should n't complain when nsa spied on them . 
  same with pineapple . 
  emphasize on fortunately . 
  fortunately never then . 
  expat may be wrong here . 
  i mean those second generation turks in germany for example . 
  well , i am against expats voting as well . 
  i mean does this even happen with other countries , can austrian expats vote for austrian elections ? 
  that 's just mean . 
  that is not a bad thing no ? 
  i want to stop the syrian immigration as well for example . 
  i have mentioned the other factors though , no ? 
  the main reason is clearly religion and conservatism . 
  i was talking about a referandum validated by turkish government but i guess that would be too good to be true . 
  sorry for being so harsh in the previous comment . 
  majority of the population is religious , have some profits by supporting akp , are bribed ( akp government gives coal to villagers for votes ) or find erdogan charismatic . 
  if chp had a more competent leader we would see an increase of votes in the next election , since davutoglu ( current leader of akp ) is n't exactly a charmer . 
  but mostly because the population is religious tbh . 
  turkey is n't some secular paradise westerners often think as . 
  majority is still conservative . 
  though this is slowly changing , the new generations are actually pretty secular and atheism is on the rise . 
  you seem to ignore all the non-turks who downvoted you as well . 
  do n't you fucking get it ? 
  turkish army will leave if the government wants , it does n't matter if we are ashamed or not . 
  eh whatever , i seen you enough in this sub to know how this will go . 
  you simply refuse to be logical and think you can remove the hairy stinky big bad turks from your islands by complaining about turks in the internet all day . 
  you are accomplishing shit . 
  furthermore , you seem to be completely oblivious to turkish part of the island . 
  you do n't care if they want turkish troops there or not . 
  frankly , the best solution is to hold a referendum on the northern part to determine wheter if the populace want our troops to stay or not . 
  no you do n't . 
  you would not be complaining if you liked it . 
  to the ignorant perhaps . 
  yeah , because this thread is completely unbiased . 
  dude , seriously ? 
  ottomans were the knly rapers and pillagers to you ? 
  definitely not biased at all . 
  butthurt is too real . 
  sweden yes !, 
  no i do n't support the same in cyprus . 
  they have bases on cyprus . 
  i did just say the occupation was not justified , and you 're saying trnc exists only in my and other turks heads ? 
  and you 're saying this without caring about that small bit regarding uk . 
  excuse ? 
  that was an entirely justified move for intervention . 
  we could n't turn away while you were oppressing turks living there . 
  though i guess continued occupation is not justified , you can say that to british as well . 
  and i do n't see you complaining about them . 
  and yet you despise the current occupation force even though they 're there because greek cypriots tried to opress turkish cypriots , which is obviously bad for your beloved country . 
  i 'm sure a good turkish government would intervene if se turkey got de facto independent to make them de jure and de facto turkish again . 
  do n't see how karabakh matters to us . 
   i do n't care a bit about you , your country and your opinion . 
  aww , if you did n't care about my country why do you want us to leave this much ? 
   until your occupation force leaves from here , that is . 
  like i said i do n't have control over that . 
  a fact you seems to be completely oblivious to . 
  i do n't care one bit about your island and i do n't care if we have a force in the island or not . 
  not like i am in the position to remove turkish forces from there anyway . 
  what i am saying is that you 're delusional if you think northern cyprus does n't exist . 
  de jure means shit . 
  yes . 
  aka north cyprus . 
  bosnia *, 
  u wot m8, 
  that was a joke . 
  does that mean turkey is the most european nation ever ? 
  huh , i thought it was fully turkish . 
  a religious person could easily justify it . 
  right decision for who ? 
  i mean i support it but you ca n't just go `` right decision '', 
  majority does not read the article . 
  -40 in erzurum , which is east . 
  it does n't get that low in other cities . 
  i fully agree . 
  minarets make everything awkward . 
  though we probably would not hold vienna to add cathedrals minarets . 
  we were already very overextended . 
  i 'm right on the meme side in the political spectrum . 
  why deal with leftists or rightist when you can enjoy some dank memes i say . 
  no stoppings on the glorious ottoman war machine . 
  armenian genocide was not an example of racism . 
  thank mr slovene, 
  rape and pillage ? 
  do n't forget annexing balkans pls !, 
  here 's how to do :\\ ^ ) , racistbro . 
  put a : , then \\ , then \\ ^ , then ) so like this but there is no space between them : : \\ \\ ^ ), 
  at least we have a culture instead of copying the brits , 
  also / int /, 
   ( and for 1683 ) u wot m8, 
  i 'm pretty sure we can win this time , so yes please . 
  hey , at least we are independent !, 
  it kinda makes me sad . 
  yes they saw us as the invaders but we were the top invaders . 
  now we only come in second place . 
  i mean the turkish military occupation bit . 
  that was largely irrelevant . 
  armenian genocide is irrelevant to this subject . 
  turks can obviously be racist but that does not mean armenian genocide gets spammed by lots of people . 
  people mention it because they know it will anger turks , nothing more . 
  the reason we do n't give a fuck about armenian genocide is because people spam it everywhere even if the subject is not about it .

  if they did they would force their non-muslim citizens to convert . 
  they did pretty much opposite . 
  when spanish king expelled jews from his kingdom , ottoman sultan sent a fleet to bring them in his empire thinking they will benefit the economy . 
  it 's really sad . 
  this is n't so different than south african apartheid . 
  you ca n't go white people 's school . 
  you ca n't ride in bus with white people . 
  is n't poland one of most racist countries in europe ? 
  apparently they tasted their own medicine and did n't like it much . 
  you can use air force too if you are planning to kill them . 
  not the ones coming from turkey !, 
  most of them are syrian . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  turkey is member of eu customs union . 
  istanbul has pretty colourful nightlife . 
  they will be ok here . 
  better than 0 % which is what we get from apple now . 
  they will only open a small office here to abuse tax-cuts like they do in ireland . 
  they will not move all their engineering offices , manufacturing plants here . 
  values they claim represent france better than anything . 
  let all people decide what they wear by their free will . 
  is germany still bitching about this ? 
  it 's not like we kidnaped their soldiers . 
  they sent couple of unarmed jets here so they can say `` we joined anti-isis campaign too '' . 
  ethnic cleansing you say !, 
  very german , very german !, 
  to trick voters who would otherwise say they are undecided !, 
  germany is an european country , not middle eastern . 
  they have no say in syria . 
  yes , right !, 
  they were abducted by martians . 
  five million muslims died because of their religion after balkan wars . 
  is this enough or do you need more blood ? 
  we need more freedom in turkey . 
  i do n't deny it . 
   while small guy ypg had thousands of brave men and women killed in action fighting back isil . 
  who cares ? 
  big guy will destroy them with jets , helicopters , tanks , howitzers . 
  they should go back east of river and enjoy the show . 
  and everybody should be happy since there will be no more isis . 
  turks since its your speciality . 
  turkish army is most effective anti-is force in syria now . 
  ypg should go back east of euphrates and let big guy deal with is . 
  ypg 's pointless efforts to stop turkish army benefit nobody but is . 
  yes !, 
  people who tried to genocide their neighbors should solve their issues with their neighbors . 
  race is a social construct . 
  scientifically there is only one human race . 
  edit : why is this downvoted ? 
  you europeans are more racist than i thought . 
  turks do n't care about continental identity . 
  i have never met a turk who calls himself european or asian all my life . 
  we call ourselves turk . 
  nobody is stopping them . 
  operation 's official name is `` euphrates shield '' . 
  who wants to pass euphrates ? 
  who do you think turkey is planning to shield from passing ? 
  turkey 's objective is very clear and turkey does n't deny it . 
  turkey is very honest unlike most actors of this war . 
   kurdish territories which was captured from isis after they ran away when they saw turkish tanks rolling towards them . 
  those villages are arab majority , not kurdish btw . 
  freedom of assembly and freedom of speech are basic civil rights . 
  they can protest or support whatever they want unless they get violent . 
  those poor nazis were so misunderstood since judaism is a religion , not a race . 
  it 's like early 20th century all over again . 
  muslims instead of jews this time !, 
  europeans never change does n't matter how hard they try . 
  yes , you helped iraqis a lot by killing 2 million of them during 2nd bush war . 
  please stop `` helping '' arabs and let them deal with their own issues . 
  they are n't syria kurds . 
  ypg is offshoot of pkk . 
  it is lead by turkey kurds , significant number of their militants are turkey kurds . 
  turkey is n't against a semi-independent region in syria but we just do n't want a hostile one . 
  turkey has pretty good relationships with iraq kurdistan . 
  true , but still !, 
  taf will destroy everything on its way including is . 
  is is finished . 
  i am fixated on hypocrisy . 
  i am agnostic and i do n't care about religious people unless they try to push their bullshit down my throat . 
  i know it and you know it no german would object a jew who wears kippah or any other judaist symbol . 
  lets be honest here !, 
  i bet she would . 
  i think people should start to wear arm bands which show they are secular . 
  this will prevent misunderstandings . 
  why is n't this big news here ? 
  turkey enters syria with tanks and special forces to end is menace . 
  is n't is terror big threat for all europe ? 
  / u/moderatorsofeurope / did n't even approve thread i posted previously . 
  i am sure he would fire a jewish intern who wears kippah too . 
  good to know it 's all about secularism !, 
   western europe do n't try to force their beliefs upon others anymore . 
  ironically this 's exactly what they do by banning burkini . 
  that 's for sure . 
  it 's one of the reasons why turkey entered syria . 
  not main reason though !, 
  turkey still considers pkk offshoot ypg bigger threat . 
  turkey never supported isis . 
  turkey just tolerated , ignored isis for two reasons : isis fights everyone including assad and pkk . 
  turkey does n't want to become main target of isis terror . 
  you are no different .

  us as in turkey . 
  this guys comment history is gold . 
   allies . 
  lol, 
   i refuted your points by telling you that during revolutions innocents die and i do n't support the idea of greeks killing turks but it happened during a war times and also because the turks were seen as oppressors . 
  this is literally the logic people denying the armenian genocide have , could you be more unaware of yourself ? 
  leave your wet dreams out of this . 
  not even all of our neighbours could actually win an offensive war , nor would they ever want to . 
  yes , and america should n't have lynched negroes !, 
  this thread will be fun . 
  r/europe needs a monthly thread to unload their hatred for us , i understand . 
  well i do n't think that makes any sense , considering that you guys were just a backwater province while turkey/greece was literally the capital of the empire for a thousand years , or more if you count the ottomans . 
  how anyone can trust the u.s is beyond me , even russia is better since they are unlikely to try to fuck us over . 
  name does not check out . 
  i didi n't say terminal cancer , jesus christ . 
  self-haters of every form exists , i guess some kind of deep freudian complex is the culprit . 
  so you 're the token minority they can point at like a zoo animal and say : `` see we 're not bigots ! '' . 
  now , i do n't know anything about french politics but i assume that ca n't be a good thing . 
  no , the spectrum between left and right does n't exist in us muslims , we 're literally non-euclidean alians . 
  yes , dear leader recep tayyip erdogan loves doing referandums , in fact he is doing one right now !, 
  such a great leader and champion of liberal democracy . 
   doctrine of islam vs  parts of the doctrine . 
  wording my friend . 
  oh no , i have cancer so i better kill myself . 
  how you can be a minority of any kind and vote for the right-wing just boggles my mind , but everything exists i guess . 
  how dare you suggest that muslims have different opinions !, 
  ! 111 we 're a hive mind and anybody who disagrees is a pc regressive cuck leftist !, 
  why was this downvoted ? 
  * shut down *, 
  the salt is just incredible . 
  it 's so much it could probably give an elephant brain hemorrhages . 
  fucking poles , they had like 1 good moment and it had to be against us . 
  thanks bro . 
  maybe i 'll go once the eu decides to stop anal probing us before giving us visas . 
  yeah , how about you bring back to life the ones you murdered too ? 
  maybe it was n't millions , but neither was bosnian genocide . 
  oh , it would be cool if you guys would stop calling for ethnic cleansing of us just because we used to speak greek a thousand years ago . 
  the blue mosque across the street ? 
  anything mimar sinan did ? 
  edit : oh , he 's alt-right . 
  i do n't think you have anymore muslims to give us in a population exchange so no . 
  edit : maybe if you give us crete , and maybe let the descendants of those you lynched move back to greece ? 
  well , i do n't see how forcing us to walk to rakka is anything but genocidal these days ... 
  tbh istanbul is n't really the most roman city in turkey , its been anatoliafied . 
   i just criticised your dumb blabbering about ethnic diversity . 
  oh , so the problem is n't islam or culture its their * ethnicity * . 
  nice to see the truth come out . 
  did you get any immigrants from your colonies back in the day ? 
  because the longer a minority has been present in a country , the better they do ( generally ) . 
  t r i m o r e t a r i m o r e t a, 
  man i love that bottom-right picture , what is the street called ? 
  do they have burn centers in serbia ? 
  ** trigger warning **, 
  we 'll join you voluntarily and since turks will then be a majority in greece we 'll annex you . 
  : dddd ottoman empire 2 : electric boogaloo, 
  polls are never a good indicator of the results tbh , but the polls ( + anecdotes ) are saying no . 
  heyy , that aint bad . 
  welcome to our reality . 
  also til turkey has that much coverage , brb gon na check what the kurds are doing . 
  i 'll probably go at some point just to see pripyat . 
  not everyone can afford to go to turkish uni . 
  i do n't think 5000 is alot though , especially considering the amount of ukrainians in turkey . 
  was n't it like scythian or something . 
  i thought he wrote in mein kampf that the existance of the polish race is an insult to germany ? 
  is there alot of turks in the ukraine ? 
  hungary does n't deserve this . 
  you guys already fucked them enough . 
  the cold war social retardation really showing itself in this thread . 
  someone tell them that all slavs were considered unworthy of life by hitler . 
  well that is highly unfortunate wording then . 
   ** descendants from non-western nations ** so assimilating changes your descent ? 
  they already stopped . 
  poorer does n't mean less likely to vote for populism ... 
  turkey has mandatory conscription , i do n't know genders or percentage . 
  i do n't really see them that much , but yes . 
  goat/sheep cheese , especially bulgarian . 
  i do n't really know anything about it , except you guys did good . 
  that 's a strange map . 
  i do n't think armenia has any territory in europe . 
  anything + bread, 
  you only need english really , everybody knows it . 
  russian is also useful . 
  nationalists hate asians here , which is pretty strange considering turkish history . 
  i do n't think anybody else has anything against you guys though , i would stay away from anyone with shaved heads if you visit . 
  you could visit , but i would avoid istanbul or izmir . 
  though most other countries would be better imo . 
  oh boy , where to start ... 
  yeah , i think its fairly representative of young european men . 
  some threads get brigaded sometimes though , you can guess which ones . 
  hong kong but warmer ? 
  i do n't think this is how it works tbh . 
  iran 's government is doing just fine without tourists . 
   parliament notes with worry , that there today are areas in denmark , where the ** share of immigrants and descendants from non-western nations surpasses 50 pct . 
  ** it is parliaments viewpoint , that danes should not be a minority in residential areas in denmark . 
  how is this not racial ? 
  how many refugees have you taken in compared to denmark ? 
   i work in london and when i 'm in the office i hear it all the time from so called `` westernised asians '' they refuse to refer to themselves as english or british , they are always pakistani . 
  i mean , why identify as british if you risk people laughing at you behind your back ? 
  though my impression is that britain is more open to assimilation than most other countries ( xcept americas ) . 
  self-awareness level : teach me senpai,

  why stop at immigrants ? 
  * all undesirables should be out !, 
  i know you are sarcastic but i have a problem with moderate and extremist terms . 
  there 's no guarantee that a moderate wo n't join an extremist group or have a change in mind and vice versa . 
  these binary terms wo n't get us anywhere . 
  the whole region is a clusterfuck that needs to be observed from a distance for some time . 
  [ pretty darn close .

   and i have over 300 confirmed mockeries of the unemployed wot, 
  i literally never said ottomans were not corrupt . 
  they just did n't give a shit about much . 
   that mentality also became part of us after so many years of being under the ottomans . 
  then came the commies too which worsened it . 
  sources please . 
  yes , it is this simple . 
  you solved it big guy . 
  no it 's not . 
  this is how simple minds think ( inb4 dae think he is the simple minded one ) . 
  it 's always someone else 's fault that romania was not a 1st world country , it 's the turk , nazis , communism , eu and whatever 's on the news today . 
  it 's never complicated . 
  if only these devils left romania alone so it could ascend to greatness and become an example of advanced civilisation . 
  false , they were not christians . 
  they had to convert to islam . 
  what he said literally made no sense , to be nice i asked him what he meant instead of asking him what the fuck he was on about . 
  what do you mean ? 
  nobody is complaining about anything . 
  you assume wrong . 
  i thought it was more like ;  to teach ( a person or group of people ) to behave in a way that you think is more polite and gentle ottomans never did this . 
  giving equal rights to christians was opposed by christians themselves because it would mean serving in the military , they 'd rather pay their way out of it . 
  christians slaughtered or deported muslims in every place they conquered in the same time frame . 
  this is why i pointed it out . 
  that 's what civilisation means ? 
  good things ? 
  indeed . 
  that 's not exactly neutral , that 's the point . 
  all men are equal , but some are more equal than others . 
  also it 's pretty funny , i could literally apologize for what my team did centuries ago ( and lick habsburg ass of course plus ignore the other team 's faults ) and these guys would still downvote me . 
   i ca n't tell if you are being sarcastic or not , but it seems to me that you are woefully unfamiliar with romanian history . 
  what even a child who has taken a basic history class on the history of romanians knows is that before the turkish invasion the romanian principalities were on the verge of becoming the equivalents of modern day switzerland . 
   in the resulting wars moldavia single-handedly staved off the ottomans for decades through acts of incredible bravery and heroic self-sacrifice . 
   this resistance took a heavy toll on moldavia , and the country could never achieve the affluence that was ready to fall into its lap if only the turks had stayed in asia where they belonged with the other primitive hordes of their kind . 
  nations never romanticize their history , never . 
  `` cultural '' christian is what it 's called i reckon . 
  i 'm not muslim either . 
  also allah damn it / r/europe stop downvoting arguments . 
  yeah , and christians literally killed or deported muslims on sight . 
  at least ottomans let you do whatever you want , in fact , they gave so little fucks that the governors could do whatever they wanted . 
  of course as a christian you 'd prefer the habsburgs . 
  also lol this is a conversation straight out of the 16th century . 
  yes , it 's the turks fault that corruption is the norm in romania . 
  it was all rainbows and progressiveness everywhere pre-turk . 
  only if the habsburgs could save you and help you with their good hearts . 
  no true neutral .

  hello my white friend . 
  guys i got this , they are really all christian turks who were manipulated by the allies in the 1800s . 
  do n't bother , this guy is our subreddit jester in / r/turkey . 
  turks who live in germany are called `` almanc\u0131 '' meaning germaner . 
  also that is n't special to istanbul , the aegean coast is pretty progressive . 
  ( \u0e07 \u0360 \u00b0 \u035f\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) \u0e07 resistance is futile . 
  it 's not imperialism , it 's bringing stability to the region . 
  \u1555 ( \u141b ) \u1557 let 's do this , it is in the rums ' interest to join us . 
  wow how dare you ? 
  you must submit to america and *** be an american !, 
  you are not loyal to the nation . 
  that was n't personally to you though . 
  damn , that 's pretty impressive . 
  however this right here is not special to turks and neither does it justifies comments like `` it is the reason why you are and always will be such an inferior and inbred nation '' . 
   the problem with the turks is that not only they do n't assimilate , but on top of this they consider themselves superior and use their overseas conmunities for lobbying and influencing other countries ' policies . 
  according to zbigniew brzezinski the top three lobbyists are israelis , cubans and armenians , let 's call them inferior and inbred too . 
  this right here is persecution complex , folks .

  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27tp1q/what_are_reuropes_views_on_this_quote_from/ci4cbeq?context=3 ), 
  do n't forget that most `` immigrant '' turks were born in germany when most of the work force came in the 70s-60s . 
  they have no duties beyond what they think their duties are . 
  their background does not and should not put pressure on them to do anything . 
  i do n't know where you got owing things from and neither are armenians relevant here . 
  i 'm not going on deranged ramblings every time i see a western european about how they do n't pay the children of slaves . 
  * you 're one of the good ones . 
  both the natives and the immigrants are at fault here . 
  many of them isolate themselves because they perceive assimilation is forced on them and that they are not welcome . 
  force it more and they 'll shield themselves even more . 
  i 'm not suggesting what should be done because i 'm not a social scientist . 
  what percentage of turks do this and how much of them go unnoticed because they are not as loud as these guys ? 
  this seems to be blown way out of proportion . 
  because most of them were born in germany and that line is associated more with racists and xenophobes ( both emotionally charged terms here i know ) . 
  it 's not like they are going to germany for a vacation that they simply can fly back .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdistan_regional_government  the turkish government did that just fine over the last year . 
  again , this is empirical fact . 
  there are videos , photos and first hand reports from non turkish/kurdish journalists to prove that turkish troops deliberately killed civilians . 
  how can you go about telling whether a person is a turk or a kurd ? 
  there are subtle differences like slight variations in skin colour but there is no way you can tell someone is a kurd/turk without knowing them . 
  i 'm sure turkish military has done many wrongs though and i do n't support any such actions , particularly if civilians are involved . 
   oh look , you 're wrong !, 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18410596 http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/ar/culture/2012/06/turkey-to-introduce-elective-kur.html http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/06/2012612133656956705.html http://rudaw.net/english/middleeast/turkey/15092014 kurdish-taught schools do exist , i 've seen it first hand . 
  not a lot of them admittedly , but they do . 
   eh , the hdp passed the 10 % threshold the second time too . 
  are you really that unaware of turkish politics ? 
  i meant in the polls . 
  right now they 're averaging 8 % on national polls . 
   because up until a few years ago , akp were the first party in the history of the turkish state to give rights to kurds . 
  when that started to change , so did the voting patterns . 
  not really no it did n't , akp is still strong as ever . 
   it happened in scotland . 
  you seem to have missed that too . 
  except scotland was already autonomous . 
  you ca n't equate them . 
  multiple countries came together to form the united kingdom , and now they almost wanted out . 
  it 's different . 
   again , nobody 's killing kurds in turkey , unless they fight for pkk/tak etc. 
  even then , they get arrested if possible . 
  ever since pkk brought the fight to the cities , yes many civilians have died . 
  if you mean to tell me there is ethnic cleansing going on in turkey against kurds , that 's just laughable . 
  many of the civilians who died were turks . 
   if they desire self rule , yes . 
  one day glorious cornwall will be independent . 
  how do you know kurds desire self rule ? 
  again , most kurds vote for akp . 
  kurds make up around 25 % of the country if i 'm not mistaken , and bdp gets around 10 % including turkish votes which makes up around half of the 10 % . 
  so realistically maybe 1/5th of all kurds have voted for bdp . 
  pkk does not speak for kurdish people , kurdish people have protested pkk themselves . 
  not a surprise since kurds suffered just as much thanks to pkk . 
   pkk : domestic kurds fighting an armed rebellion against the turkish government , using terrorist tactics against police and soldiers . 
  see there 's our problem , you think pkk does n't target civilians . 
  well they do . 
  if you do n't believe me , i can link to you many suicide bombings which they executed in public , or killing drivers of cars that they stop in the middle of the road , etc. 
   if you think there is any kind of logic in your comparison , i am afraid we can add logic to literally in the list of words you do not understand . 
  how about we focus on arguments instead of coming up with stupid insults ? 
  i do know what literally means by the way , i literally thought i literally wrote that exact sentence but it turns out i did not . 
   nope , i pointed out the civilians die in every conflict and that drawing an arbitrary line between civilians who die due to ` terrorism ' and those who die due to ` military actions ' is stupid . 
  it is n't stupid at all . 
  targeting civilians will result in a much higher death toll and it speaks volumes about the motivations of the armed group . 
  if you 're gon na equate deliberately targeting civilians and accidental civilian casualties , we might as well put u.s. and al-qaeda on the same basket . 
  you 're invalidating your argument regarding al-qaeda . 
   turkey has shown that it presents an existential threat to any kurdish organisation or state within syria . 
  how many ypg troops and syrian kurdish civilians has turkey killed with it 's artillery and airforce already ? 
  aha , you 're avoiding the question and answering with another question . 
  answer the question i asked with a simple yes or no , ca n't be too difficult . 
  so let me ask you again : do you think ypg is justified in assisting/arming pkk who has and probably will continue targeting civilians ? 
   turkey will not offer a plebiscite or independence to kurds in turkey . 
  neither does spain for catalonia , is there anything more natural for a country to try to remain whole ? 
   kurds suffer discrimination at best they really do n't though , i mean not anymore . 
  turkey has allowed kurdish to be taught at schools , i mean there are schools with only kurdish curriculum . 
  speaking kurdish is not illegal , saying that you 're a kurd is not illegal . 
  provide sources when you say kurds face discrimination . 
   death at worse in turkey nobody goes around killing kurdish civilians . 
  there 's literally more than 15 million kurds in turkey . 
  they live together with turks just fine . 
  if even half of those 15 million kurds supported independence , it would have happened already . 
  but most kurds vote for erdogan ( whom i hate by the way ) . 
   erdogan has shown he wants less independence and less self determination for kurds in turkey . 
  yeah i hate him too but you really got ta cite some sources . 
  it was during his presidency that kurdish schools became a thing , a kurdish national channel ( trt kurdi ) was opened , etc. 
   given that they have no access to democratic means to achieve independence , what do you expect the more radical elements to do ? 
  again and again , the kurdish party bdp barely gets any sizeable votes . 
  the one time it did alright in the parliament ( passing the 10 % threshold ) was the time secular turks voted for bdp in order for akp to not have absolute majority . 
  the next elections , bdp fell under the threshold again . 
  you really expect us to hold a fucking referendum to split our country apart ? 
  how would you want to do that ? 
  do i get to vote as a turk ? 
  do i have a say in what happens to my country 's lands ? 
  would 've happened in spain or the u.s. already if such things would happen . 
   turkey has shown that it has no problem in indiscriminately killing kurds in turkey , syria and at times , iraq . 
  again , nobody 's killing kurds in turkey , unless they fight for pkk/tak etc. 
  even then , they get arrested if possible . 
   turkey has a right to defend its borders and its cohesion as a state . 
  yes . 
   kurds in syria have a right to defend themselves against turkey . 
  yes . 
   kurds in turkey have the natural right to self rule through democratic means . 
  so because they are of a different ethnicity , they should self-rule ? 
  goddammit dude , if all minorities in each country were to gain independence , we would see thousands of new countries form . 
  all turkish citizens are equal under turkish law . 
   you 're justifying ( legitimising ) the deaths of civilians as long as it can be claimed that it was n't ` deliberate ' . 
  i 'm not though . 
  i 'm just saying there 's a difference between civilian casualties that arise due to war and deliberately targeting civilians . 
  neither are justified , but there is a difference . 
   you did n't ` literally say you can not justify civilian killings ' . 
  yeah apparently i did n't , thought i did . 
   you do n't know what literally means . 
  i do , and what does this have to do with anything ? 
   i never said 9/11 is justified . 
  nah you did n't but it 's the same logic . 
  if turkish citizens deserve to be killed by pkk terrorists because their government killed kurds in the past , with that same logic 9/11 would be justified too since the u.s. also killed civilians . 
   i never even mentioned the pkk . 
  well you did n't mention ypg either until your previous comment , so how am i supposed to know ? 
  we were discussing how ypg was arming/assisting pkk and you replied to that comment .

  pathetic . 
  if berkin 's a terrorist , here 's a [ pic ] ( http://media.dunyabulteni.net/haber/2014/03/12/berkin555.jpg ) from his funeral . 
  look at all these terrorist supporters ( ! ), 
  go arrest 1.5 million people there if you can . 
  they talk shit about you guys on reddit so i assumed it was a meme . 
  i did n't think the majority as dutch population actually hates the whole country or anything . 
  waffles and chocolate they say they have an aircraft carrier though i seriously doubt it dutch hate them brits hate them probably does n't even exist tintin, 
  northeastern syria is controlled by ypg . 
  isis controlled wells are in central part mostly and syrian oil is insignificant to what isis controls in iraq anyway . 
  the wells do stop on the turkish border btw , that 's why that border is drawn in the first place . 
  syria has never been an oil economy . 
  they had decent industry compared to their size but anything lootable is already looted in the northern part . 
  there is nothing to loot there , and loot is n't how wars impact economy in the modern ages anyway . 
  syria is n't really oil rich and most of the existing wells are n't even in northern syria so i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  maybe you meant northern iraq , which also does n't make sense because of turkey 's close relations with the krg . 
  here 's why akp is responsible : getting involved in the syrian civil war which was none of our business , actively helping islamist factions in the war some of which formed/joined isis later , letting islamist terrorist cells grow and recruit in turkey to help them topple assad , creating a safe haven for armed militants in turkey letting them get in the country whenever they want , legitimizing isis by calling them `` not terrorists but a bunch of angry kids '' , islamizing the society starting with the education system giving terrorists manpower and sympathy sources , politically purging the police force and getting incapable partisans in charge , refusing to focus on islamist terrorism threat ... 
  i can go on for hours . 
  it 's not that high class , upper middle class kids can go there in special occasions so there would n't be that many bodyguards etc. 
  though a lone wolf would have a hard time planning this , not to mention getting an assault rifle + lots of grenades . 
  it seems organized . 
  it 's even worse because christians in this land have celebrated christmas for centuries , not to mention ancient turkic traditions about end of the year and winter solistice so in no way is this tradition foreign to this land , whereas muslim holidays are actually foreign to western europe . 
  still would n't make it ok to hate other peoples ' traditions but this is even more moronic than that . 
  the point of the celebration is the day starts winning against night , as days get gradually longer and nights shorter after 21st . 
  the day and the night are two different beings at a state of constant war in turkic mythology . 
  the day is nicer to humans so they celebrate when it starts to win . 
  21st is the winter solistice . 
  tengriist turks were very much into astronomy considering their god was literally the sky itself . 
  they started using a 12 month calendar pretty early on and knew about the solistices . 
  21st december was the date the day god has beaten the night god in turkic mythology , so it was celebrated as nardugan ( sun 's rebirth ) . 
  the tree decoration comes from the tree of life belief which is pretty common among pagan belief systems . 
  pine trees were commom in central asia and decorating them with fruits symbolized rebirth of the nature . 
  `` this is foreign to our culture '' yeah sure . 
  stupidity knows no bounds . 
  turks have been celebreting the end of winter in the last 5-10 days of december for thousands of years , before their prophet was even born . 
  they were even decorating pine trees with apples . 
  also santa is from demre , antalya . 
  how much more local can you get ? 
  that hostility , the ignorance for other cultures as well as their own culture is what 's foreign to this land . 
  their toxic ideology is foreign here . 
  21st century and the inexplicable urge to use `` post '' everything . 
  is the world completely out of creativity , or do writers just assume their readers are too stupid to understand a new term and have to tie it to the old one even if it misses the point or makes little sense ? 
  let 's call the renaissance period post-medieval while we 're at it , and the industrial age post-renaissance or even post-post-medieval why not ? 
  i want to live in a post - `` post '' world . 
  i was referring to the immigration wave of the 1850 's to mostly russia . 
  every other developed nation had colonies to solve their overpopulation problem after the industrial population boom . 
  germany did n't so they 've gone to eastern europe . 
  i know . 
  the difference between them is just as the op described . 
  one of them believe that god sent text a , the others believe god sent text a and b. 
  that 's why i showed that as an example . 
  are the catholic god and the mormon god different ? 
  how about aloisburg ? 
  i 'm from istanbul and completely ok with that . 
  the reich would n't be completely \u00d6ster though , wester territory is also in it . 
  unless you count whole modern day germany as the east part and consider france and belgium the western part of the reich , which would be a bit problematic . 
  yeah they were our favorite occupation force . 
  they never gave shit to the local populace and did n't even try to form their own institutions , just let the local ones stay . 
  when we said we 're taking the land back they shrugged , said have a nice one and left without firing a single bullet . 
  as you said they sold their weapons , and in some instances they just left them without taking anything in return . 
  i guess they were still pissed at brits . 
  1910s in general , you 're right . 
  the thing is after the balkan wars huge turkish refugee waves from the balkans came to the area and changed the population dynamics . 
  he suspected the guy might 've been the terrorist and contacted the authorities , that was his civic duty . 
  to confirm or deny his involvement is n't his job . 
  he is n't the one who screwed up . 
  110 upvotes though . 
  he is an islamist , listen to his speech . 
  there are a shitload of islamists in the police force , courtesy of akp . 
  * kopenhag * ljubljana * be\u00e7 ( until 19 . century ), 
  yeah i wonder why nobody cares that turkey allows celebrating christmas and keeps talking about tiny issues like assasination of the fucking russian ambassador in public by a fucking police officer . 
  i think it 's because they are jealous of our new bridge , there ca n't be any other explanation . 
  i ( and also nearly everyone in this thread ) know this wo n't cause a war between turkey and russia let alone wwiii . 
  it will however disrupt relations and cause bigger problems for turkey then just that . 
  the event order aligning with franz ferdinand 's assasination brings a bit of dark humor to it . 
  i know you want to put that hard earned high school degree to good use by trying ta lecture people on reddit but please go bother someone else . 
  we 're as tense as we can be over here . 
  they actually said they want to be a part of the investigation . 
  it 's getting dark , fast . 
  no they are n't . 
  it 's not clear what he 's saying in that moment with camera turning away so i ca n't say which for sure, 
  part sounded like towns to me . 
  probably referring to syrian cities . 
  if you still need a licence it 's pretty normal . 
  french women tend to know how to carry themselves and considered to be more feminine . 
  those are cultural traits , not ethnic . 
  he probably ca n't understand why he 's still a virgin . 
  shit i just have to try that . 
  there are no artikels in turkish , feminine/masculine words as a concept does n't exist in the turkish language . 
  turkey refers to itself as the `` anayurt '' ( like the russian motherland , unlike the german fatherland ) so it 's usually referred as feminine in languages with artikels . 
  it 's `` die t\u00fcrkei '' in german for example . 
  that 's not about immigration , that 's about istanbul 's infrastructure . 
  istanbul is n't capable of having 15 million residents . 
  i 'm not anti immigrant , i welcome syrians in turkey ( those actually running away from the war , not erdo\u011fan 's bff jihadists ) but not in istanbul . 
  not because they are syrians , i 'm also strongly against migration to istanbul from within the country . 
  the problem is that not all syrians in turkey are actual refugees . 
  jihadists who ran away from the saa and ypg are accepted in the country by the akp government . 
  those violent idiots cause lots of social problems in turkey . 
  people who do n't have political understanding of the situation do n't understand that these people act this way because they are jihadists , not because they are syrians . 
  they blame all syrians for their actions . 
  akp also fans the flames by knowingly settling conservative sunni populations in majority alevi lands to change the ethnic composition which leads to frictions between communities .

  when i learned trump won , i just started laughing like a maniac lol . 
  if le pen wins i 'll laugh harder but that wo n't happen fortunately . 
  my faith in humanity and democracy took enough hits lately , i ca n't take more . 
  need voters ? 
  just import some people who are likely to vote for you and give them citizenship . 
  what could go wrong ? 
  let 's call usa `` trumpistan '' to avoid this whole `` america '' confusion . 
  s. america will be thankful . 
  in english : nietzsche in turkish : ni\u00e7e . 
  english needs some of these letters . 
  dem votes . 
  he wants that as a payment for turning turkey into a refugee buffer zone . 
  that 's never gon na happen though . 
  things suck but turkish secularists and leftists wo n't throw their passports in a dumpster and hole up in europe until erdo\u011fan dies or something . 
  maybe if civil war breaks out . 
  they get nosier in march , but got ta let the little fellas have their fun . 
  tbh our cats are probably too fat and lazy to chase mice too . 
  they are treated just as good ( vaccinated and tracked by the government , fed by the people ) but outside of the big cities things are worse . 
  in sakarya there was a big scandal about poisoned dogs . 
  some suggested the municipality was involved but they dismissed the claim . 
  the municipality said that the police was on the case and they also said they decided to hire vets for this . 
  and occasionally there are news about rabid dogs attacking people . 
  such news are rare in the big cities . 
  you must have seen ear clippings on dogs . 
  that 's how they are kept track of . 
  how to solve a catsplosion : dwarven atom smasher let 's hope nobody understands the reference and i do n't get banned . 
  fun fact : in the last election we had an electricity blackout ... just at the exact moment when the election was happening ... for some mysterious reason . 
  our energy minister said a cat went inside an electricity substation and that why most of turkey 's regions had no electricity . 
  either our government is lying or our government is so incompetent a rebel cat can sabotage a substation and cause blackouts throughout the entire country . 
  so in a sense , cats of \u0130stanbul are an anti-government militia force that occasionally sabotages government infrastructure . 
  by that logic they are even more deserving of upvotes !, 
  you hate turkey ? 
  you upvote submissions about freedom fighting cats of turkey . 
  `` cats on internet '' synergy is a nice bonus too . 
  there is plenty of food and cat shelters on streets provided by people . 
  some of the ones i see in street are insanely fat i just wonder what the hell they have been eating . 
  one day cats will become the majority in the city . 
  that 's why \u0130stanbul is so free of rats and the like . 
  and it still crawls with birds . 
  i feed them on my window every day . 
  \u0130stanbul will probably have a cat problem of some sorts years later . 
  everyone keeps feeding them and building shelters for them , so it 's not like their population can go down naturally . 
  i do n't know what kind of an effect it will have if they keep increasing in numbers . 
  they are fuckin cute though . 
  how can you not hate 'em i mean look at what they do to their [ women ] ( https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3a%2f%2f3.bp.blogspot.com%2f-pkp--2oxduq%2fulchmyjmooi%2faaaaaaaaadu%2ffjquw4aj3bq%2fs1600%2fburka_cat__37817.jpg&amp;f=1 ) . 
  appalling . 
  what is the government saying about this ? 
  are they just hiding and hoping that the protests die down and this whole thing is forgotten about ? 
  school forces you to . 
  if you do n't memorize it you are just gon na fail your chemistry classes . 
  my biggest problem was maths though . 
  i kept forgetting formulas and and even when i got everything right i lost focus and made some simple substraction/division/addition / multiplication mistakes and my answer was wrong . 
  i wanted to become a programmer but my maths was just really bad i said fuck it and became a translator . 
  we read shop signs for the practice so we do n't forget to read !, 
  in the last year of my high school , the classroom was basically a k\u0131raathane . 
  teacher talking with students on what football matches to bet on , students reading newspapers in class , students playing card games , sneaking to restrooms to smoke a cigarette when they can . 
  i mostly just slept through classes or read novels . 
  school is a fucking waste of time . 
  i met my best friends there though , that 's the only plus for me . 
   i mean ... yes ? 
  really ? 
  that 's weird . 
  nobody in turkey bothers with reading it except for the really devout people , so they just listen to `` experts '' telling them what quran is . 
  it 's really dumb . 
  he means when villagers move to cities , they bring their villager mindset with them rather than adapting to city life and learning city manners , things like not throwing thrash on the ground or covering up your mouth when you sneeze or basic traffic rules . 
  and the cities they live in adapt to them instead . 
   questions about books were in exams i just memorized that shit , like everyone . 
   i think we simply do n't like reading books i do n't think something like that can be attributed to national differences . 
  school made me hate books . 
  i voluntarily started to read in high school and realized that they can be enjoyable . 
  but we live in the western provinces . 
  in eastern provinces books are seen as a waste of time and are too expensive so it 's even worse there . 
  yeah i memorized words without knowing what they mean . 
  aquifer for example , in high school . 
  i memorized the definition of it which is just some meaningless jargon for me . 
  i gave that answer at the exam , which was a true answer , but i still had no idea what the fuck aquifer meant . 
  then i played a video game ( dwarf fortress ) that has aquifers then i learned what it is . 
  also , periodic table . 
  that fucker was difficult to memorize . 
  yes they still believe it . 
  do all christians read the bible ? 
   how many atheists really are there in turkey ? 
  statistics are unreliable about this topic . 
  i never did . 
  there was an hour every week where we were forced to read a random book . 
  nobody read anything though , everyone just fooled around . 
  sounds unbelievable , i know . 
  the western areas are better about it but the southeast basically has no life . 
  edit : wait did you find the book reading part unbelievable or art culture part ? 
  again the southeast is bringing book reading stats down . 
  we used to have rural schools called village institutions but they were closed down because us wanted us to ( to combat the commie threat and to keep villagers ignorant and docile before they asked for things like better working conditions ) . 
  things were better before that . 
  really , 40 % of turks never reading a book seems more plausible to me than % 70 of turks never attending any cultural or arts events . 
  you can ( excluding school books ) . 
  i could if i wanted to . 
  there is a stereotype in turkey about all architects being laz . 
  so while every character in the movie speaks with perfect \u0130stanbul turkish , they had that egyptian architect guy speaking with a laz accent . 
  and laz accent sounds funny to us \u0130stanbullers . 
  also the dubbers were just talented which is something hard to come by . 
  italians know their shit .

  why ? 
  do you hate us so much ? 
  as if colonial france did n't kill anyone . 
  also recognising so called armenian genocide did n't help at all . 
  the only way to solve this problem is forcing secular turks to have more babies, 
  even though if we were the most democratic country in the world . 
  i really do n't think we will ever join eu . 
  why do you think muslim women wear black hijab ? 
  they are the masters of japanese martial arts . 
  they are the best ninjas . 
  i think he is secretly trying make europe more islamic / s, 
  why does swedes hates turks this much ? 
  they actually did and killed 241 people, 
  if the leader of turkeys wife wears hijab 50 % of the women will wear hijab if she walks around naked than 50 % will do the same thing . 
  this is the most significant problem of turkey . 
  people change their lifestyles just to earn more money, 
  yes , we except all of you to learn turkish , eat kebab and watch turkish tv series all day long / s, 
  turkish people chose corrupt money that erdo\u011fan pays some over democracy while erdo\u011fan chose saudis ( actually qataris ) over modernity, 
  i was driving last night back home around 11:30 pm and i called my mother to ask how she is . 
  when i first heard erdo\u011fan 's voice on my phone , my first though was erdo\u011fan is with my mother i should rush home ... 
  plate number of samsun ( 55 ), 
  savages , they even kill children !, 
  look at the poor kid in the middle / s, 
  what if they were turks . 
  we have a higher gdp per capita than ukraine and lower employment but i really ca n't see europeans welcoming us as well after hanging out for a long time in r/europe, 
  sure ? 
  turkeys population will be 98 million by 2100, 
  you will see that in 2019 most of those kurds will vote for erdo\u011fan rather than hdp . 
  kurds are the most conservative bunch of people in turkey thus akp is the most appealing party for them . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_general_election,_november_2015#/media/file%3aturkish_general_election%2c_november_2015_ ( akp ) . png map of akp votes in 2015 general elections south east of turkey is 80 % kurdish and as you can see akp gets votes around 40 % -20 % from every kurdish majority city . 
  you are telling me what happened years ago , they have every right i do . 
  i am on my phone just type general election results for turkey in to google and look at the south east of turkey . 
  okay mate you can keep supporting baby killers . 
  there is no point of explaining anything to you . 
  what should the state do give these terrorist the land our grandfathers fought for . 
  are you kidding with me check the latest election results . 
  kurdish majority areas voted 40 % for akp 55 % for hdp and the rest voted for other parties . 
  i really do n't understand these people . 
  they might hate erdo\u011fan but in retaliation supporting a terrorist organisation which kills civilians , kids , teachers , doctors , police and millitary officers is totally wrong . 
  i wonder what they would do if someone tries to carve a country out of sweden and during the process kills 40.000 swedes, 
  i do n't like erdo\u011fan however probably he is the least anti kurdish turkish president . 
  around 40 % of kurds voted for him in the presidential elections . 
  2 of his ministers are kurds, 
  i do n't like erdo\u011fan however probably he is the least anti kurdish turkish president . 
  around 40 % of kurds voted for him in the presidential elections, 
  if you like partying go to split otherwise i would recommend dubrovnik, 
  why ? 
  what i meant was even the most anti erdo\u011fan newspaper have a simmilar stance against austria, 
  americans and their doughnuts, 
  did n't someone else post the same image with the same title like 1 month ago, 
  h\u00fcrriyet is not a pro- erdo\u011fan newspaper, 
  unless the immigration officer wants to create some problem or have a grudge against your country than you might have a problem . 
  i always get my schengen visa from france and barely visit there except germany i had no problems entering another country with french schengen visa even if it is my first time after i got my visa . 
  as a turk why should n't i defend turkish interests ? 
  to be honest this is not a polical rally , it is a commemoration event, 
  i guess we turks really like crescents since we turks found the red crescent, 
  cause i will pay you 10.000.000 $ to relax - trump, 
  the party leaders specifically asked people who are gon na attend to the rally to only bring turkish flag , picture of ataturk and banners with justice written on them . 
  ( they did n't want any party flags ), 
  there is police protection, 
  which represent 20 million people, 
  nothing bad happened and the walk is over, 
  what europeans do n't understand is no one in turkey gives a fuck about cyprus and greece, 
  erdo\u011fan way less islamic than g\u00fclen . 
  g\u00fclen wants an \u0130ran ilke turkey while erdo\u011fan dreams of a muslim version of russia, 
  i didnt understand what 's the map about but since we are in eu no worries, 
  he ca n't do anything to the main opposition leader unless he wants to start a civil war, 
  he usually greats foreign leaders in english however , when they ask him a question in english , he just smiles and does nothing till his translator comes there to help him, 
  i have visited spain 3 times and most people were only able to speak basic english just like turkey . 
  however , when it comes to other languages like french you guys are way better of than us . 
  ok , i confess we are all retards when it comes to learning foreign languages / s, 
  that hand gesture looks like a vagina . 
  our language is more similar to korean and japanese than any other european language and when you look at those countries , they also have great trouble learning english, 
  yes , turks in europe are mostly from inland east while i am from istanbul which is a costal city, 
  i study in australia ( not austria ) and that 's the case over there too . 
  i guess turks care more about profit than quality . 
  most turkish restaurant abroad does n't actually cook turkish food but just fast food, 
  probably because of the price also , we have dishes called '' zeytinya\u011fl\u0131 '' which most people eat at home which does n't have any meat in it . 
  edit : while meat prices are similar to many european countries , vegetables and fruits are relatively cheaper in turkey unless they are imported stuff like mangos , avocados etc mate your country is soo expensive 2 months ago i was in zurich and i paid like 20 euros for a large big mac meal . 
  in turkey you can buy 4 big mac meals for the same price, 
  meat is expensive and turks consume a lot of fish which is not included in this graph ( fish is cheaper ) . 
  most turkish meals we cook at home does n't have that much meat in it to be honest, 
  the state =\\ = akp . 
  akp is the goverment while the state includes everyone . 
  i know turks who registered their cars in bulgaria since it is 30 % cheaper there . 
  the only thing you have to do is to take the car out of the country every 6 months . 
  you are wrong all of the nukes are still at incirlik airbase and i was just kidding, 
  we are gon na nuke it , that will show it a leasson !, 
  you rescued your self mate it just took 90 more years . 
  live long turkey and azerbaijan, 
  but they did n't have any weapons on board, 
  there was n't any drugs found on the ship, 
  we will probably open warning fire on a greek ship next week than we will be even and everyone will forget about it .

  to be honest , greek ships also always violets turkish waters, 
  even if it was a provocation , the greek costguard opened fire on a civilian ship and jeopardised the safety of the crew . 
  likewise in turkish , we tend to write with 24 hr clock but use the 12 hour one to read .

  [ cgp grey ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsxme8h6iyc ) explains it rather well . 
  well , how did you become king then ? 
  that would be a correct analogy if anarchists ' ultimate goal were the abolishment of smart phones . 
  other brands of phones are a product of capitalism as well , the fact that it 's an iphone does n't change anything . 
  you just misspelled `` the one true king '' . 
   firstly , half of what you have mentioned is less relevant to eastern europe , and the colonialism aspect is completely absent . 
  i agree , but if you 're pushing for european integration and all that , the burden should be shared too , no ? 
  though obviously , what i 've said has nothing to do with countries like serbia , since it 's not in eu . 
   secondly , it would still be a suicidal move , and therefore the crime is irrelevant because the `` punishment '' is inconceivable . 
  i do n't propose taking africans in europe , it 's obviously not feasible in greater numbers . 
  i 'm just against your statement which indicated european living standart has nothing to do with african poverty . 
   thirdly , as is demanded by these deeply-held beliefs of yours , in the name of ottoman imperialism in the balkans that has retarded the region 's development for the sake of turkish enrichment , gib reparations turkish enrichment ? 
  the anatolians suffered under the ottoman rule as much as balkanians did until 19th century . 
  balkans were a colony as much as anatolia was a colony . 
  it was literally the least developed part of the empire , certainly less developed than balkans . 
  and the ruling class did n't see itself as turks until the balkans were lost . 
  actually they used the word as an insult for illiterate poor peasants . 
  if the ottomans were still around , you would be valid , but the republic is a different entity than the ottoman state . 
  the higher living standart in europe is partly due to africa . 
  its ' resources are exploited by the globalist capital economy , most of which are either american or european . 
  not to mention the global warming which , again , is caused by highly industrialized western countries and , ** most importantly ** , these countries ' direct exploitation of the continent through colonialism for 150 years . 
  turks came from central asia . 
  that 's something out of the thick of it , right there . 
   maybe the people are just feeling that way because they 're idiots . 
  yes , suddenly , people thought ; `` hey , why do n't we elect a xenophobic idiot as our leader ? '' . 
  populists like trump only get prevalent because the so called left is out of touch with the average american . 
  they got bogged down in identity politics , offering no economic solution to the stagnating wages , increasing poverty and the housing costs . 
  populist-nationalists like trump thrive in these circumstances , even though they do n't offer any real solution .

  actually , i just found two separate irish words and slapped them together . 
  it means `` gray crow '' in irish . 
  `` in order to ensure the security and continuing stability , the republic will be reorganized into the third french empire , for a safe and secure society . '', 
  it is so in turkish as well ; * kral * . 
  apparently , the word was adopted into turkish from serbian language . 
  yay ! ... 
   certain areas which everybody knows to avoid .

  it 's a made up term which does n't say much . 
  the whole conversation was about konrad adenauer , and this guy just tried to defend konrad adenauer by bringing up the things done by stalin , presumably because the person he was responding to had a russian flair . 
  this is the textbook definition of whataboutism . 
  whataboutism at its worst . 
  how is this even relevant ?

  the colour of the middle column reminds me of the bourbon flag . 
  carpathian sea was such a big project that there could 've been a sea . . on the mountains . 
  ussr was so ambitious that it could even provide its ' subjects with sea . 
  state communism is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural . 
  ussr became so powerful , the only thing it was afraid of was losing its ' power , which eventually , of course , it did . 
  unfortunately , it taught it 's subjects everything they would need to become independent , then they killed it in its weakest moment . 
  it 's ironic . 
  ussr could save its satellite states from collapsing , but not itself . 
   however , even that limited attraction of the city disappeared after the current mayor came to power at 1994 ( yes , 23 years ago ) . 
  to show the gravity of the situation , this is the mayor who claimed that a certain earthquake might 've been man-made . 
  why would it ? 
  there 's no personal grudge between the ruling class and the revolutionaries , it 's not like an ethnic civil war . 
  they just want to confiscate their property and political power . 
  of course , there would be deaths on both sides , but i do n't think a total extermination would take place , no matter which side wins . 
  probably a civil war between the revolutionaries and the military . 
   marx was very clear about the essence of what the `` dictatorship of the proletariat '' would be and it fully entitled violence , on a huge scale , against the `` enemy social classes '' . 
  marxism is absolutely inherently violent and genocidal by definition . 
  `` dictatorship of the proleteriat '' would not seek to exterminate the bourgeouis , they would just seize their private property and political power . 
  revolutionaries would not be any more violent than the ruling class . 
  paris commune is a good example . 
  ** * gay * **, 
  they 'll go with the `` working with our foreign enemies against our country '' theme . 
  when you say corrupt , it usually implies financial corruption . 
  which is what their own ministers were accused of back in the day . 
  the french , praising monarchy ? 
  it must be `` restoration '' time .

  even he ca n't spin it like that . 
  the mp was arrested under the charges of spying , because he revealed that the turkish intelligence had been sending arms to jihadists in syria .

  the french has a `` foothold '' to the southwest as well , i see . 
   the sky is fallin `` human race that we run '' ... 
  just 10 . 
  though they stand only in northern ireland , which has only 18 constituencies .

  99 % of palestinians want self determination , it 's only a minority of turkish kurds that are separatist kurdish nationalists . 
  i hate hamas and armed groups , but if you want to be an apologist for terror groups . 
  i thought you were joking about the first sentence , but it seems you were genuine . 
  it seems necessary to clarify that this is something everyone in turkey agrees on was completely wrong , it was n't done by the people 's decision , the leader of the military coup , kenan evren , took that decision personally to ban it in public . 
   there is still a long list of legitimate discriminatory measures that kurds cite . 
  there really is n't anymore . 
  they have equal rights like any other citizen and they have their cultural rights . 
  that 's what i 'm trying to say . 
  i was talking about the rights in the decades before the pkk conflict started , not 45 years before . 
  dersim started with a rebellion that was put down , and after that civilians were unfairly targetted and expelled . 
  grey wolves with the support of the us government aswell mostly fought against leftists many of which were alevi . 
  what percentage of kosovo albanians do not want to separate from serbia ? 
  plus they have a pretty good historical claim , being a clear majority and as albanians native to the region unlike slavs . 
  no offense , but it seems pretty clear cut that they have no interest in being part of serbia and making up a clear majority for a long time they deserve to make that decision . 
  the case of kurds in turkey is very different . 
  there was an election in november where a ` pro kurdish ' party that officially is n't nationalist , it just wants more cultural rights and self rule got 5 million votes , which took it just over the election threshold of 10 % which limited erdo\u011fan 's influence . 
  the thing is it got past that threshold with the votes of a lot of turkish leftists , perhaps accounting for as much as 1-2 % of the 10 % achieved , and there is 12 million kurmanci kurds and 4 million zazas who mostly consider themselves kurds in turkey . 
  that means that if you disregard the non kurdish leftist voters and the kurds who voted for cultural rights and not particularly separatist reasons , there 's at the very most 4-5 million separatist kurds out of ~ 16 million , but it 's most likely not that much . 
  so not even near the majority of turkish kurds that wants self determination even with a generous estimate . 
  and it 's true what he said , you can confirm it for yourself , what kurdish nationalists call turkish kurdistan has belonged to assyrians and armenians for thousands of years before kurds even came to the south east . 
  their historical homeland is in todays western iran in the zagros mountains , but they immigrated en masse north west wards to today 's turkey after allying with the ottomans due to shared sunni islam against the shia safavids , but they are an iranic people with by far closest cultural ties to other iranians . 
  there was a ( often not enforced ) ban on speaking kurdish in public made by a military coup leader in the 80s that was repealed in 1989 . 
  for the last decade there 's been free kurdish tv channels , kurdish education in schools and universities , all the restrictions have been gone for a while now . 
  pkk has done suicide bombings on civilians , killed random kurdish and turkish civilians , bombed , killed and kidnapped tourists , killed several hundreds of doctors , teachers and engineers sent to the region , how do you even begin to compare that to some restrictions on cultural rights and imprisoning kurdish nationalists , which was the reality for kurds before pkk started armed combat ? 
  tell me how you can begin to compare that . 
  except now , when they want to bomb tourists , most of the time ( though not always ) they switch over to a supposed splinter group called tak when they want to bomb tourists . 
  the turkish state also did bad things during the conflict especially in the 90s , but it does n't come close to this stuff . 
  that was stuff like forcing people out of their villages and into the cities to stop pkk from mobilizing there . 
  it 's bad , no doubt about it , but it does n't come close . 
  well i meant in the 60s and 70s not nowadays , even though that fear has n't completely disappeared in the older generation . 
  you 're right though , it was n't meant as an argument against reunification at all . 
  those so called sporadic bouts of intercommunal fighting were much more one sided against turkish cypriots than you conveniently make it out to be . 
  you 're also forgetting the whole coup attempt by greek fascists . 
  i do n't know what your definition of legal or illegal is but undisputably a legitimate fear for the safety of turkish cypriots . 
  it 's a shame it all has to be related to islam despite both countries being ruled by strict secularism for a long time by now , we could have a nice relationship based on common history , common interests , economical development and tourism ( i was in bosnia last year , it was beautiful ) . 
  we have several million people of bosniak ancestry in turkey even . 
  it 's only natural that we have a good relationship where we help each other out , but i understand you do n't want it if it 's all about islam . 
  probably that wo n't change as long as we have this islamist erdo\u011fan shithead ruling . 
  i guess one positive is that the version of islam practiced by turkey and in extension bosniaks stops saudi arabia from being able to brainwash and radicalize people with wahhabi mosques . 
   catholics for the most part since it was mostly a catholic population at that time i seem to remember reading that bosnia pre-ottomans had its own church that both the catholic and orthodox church viewed as heretical which was one of the big reason why bosniaks were so easily compelled to convert . 
  you 're arguing things i never claimed in any way . 
  as someone with english as your mother language you really ought to have better reading comprehension . 
  compared to belarus , tajikistan , kyrgyzstan , kazakhistan , turkmenistan , uzbekistan it 's nothing out of the norm yes , compared to those it 's not even that bad . 
  that 's not even disputable . 
  yes armenia is better however little that means , i never claimed otherwise . 
  turkey is also better than armenia with erdo\u011fan , hooray ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democracy_index also the notion that you can sense from both the guy i responded to and you is that this should even begin to factor into who is in the wrong and who is in the right with regards to the nagorno-karabakh conflict , and that 's ridiculous . 
  that 's whataboutism . 
  that 's just something you bring up if you ca n't bring up relevant arguments for your side about the conflict itself . 
  aliyev is not an unpopular leader believe it or not , he 's maybe not a putin , but not unpopular , no . 
  your problem with his policies by the way has nothing in the slightest to do with his autocratic ways , it 's just a cheap way to make your side look better . 
  if he was elected democratically none of the issues you have with him would go away . 
  azerbaijan is definitely autocratically ruled but it 's nothing really out of the norm for post soviet countries . 
  apart from the corruption aliyev is hardly an unpopular leader among his people . 
  people in this part of the world tend to not put as much importance into democracy . 
  and armenia is also far from perfect if we 're talking about democracy and freedom . 
  i do n't know if my comment got misconstrued as support for erdo\u011fan , that was n't the point at all , it 's just more logical to assume isis did it seeing their apparent new focus on the turkish military rather than assume a false flag with no evidence of it, 
  most kurds would disagree with being called ` of turkish origin ' , if it was n't so you would be right . 
  a separate state is not even the wish of the majority of turkish kurds . 
  statistics from turkey , yes , i can send it later when i 'm not my phone . 
  kurds have a much lower economic status and worse education on average so it 's should n't be surprising in the least , nor is it disputable in any way , but of course people want to label you a racist for saying it . 
  isis dedicated their latest newspaper release to the turkish military . . 
  but even if that was n't the case , it makes no sense ever to claim anything was ` obviously ' a false flag without evidence . 
  they have n't even said they would enter syria on background of this attack , if it was a false flag they would almost certainly already have entered . 
  yeah , that ` be european ' part of the accession progress is a real pain . 
  definitely what 's holding us back . 
  you pretty much explained the conflict between secular and conservative in turkish society lol . 
  but most secular people would never call turkey a muslim country , rather a secular ( emphasis ) country with a population that is muslim majority . 
  let 's see what russia 's ally iran says to russia supporting pkk , people keep saying this , i 'd love to see it really https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_of_free_life_of_kurdistan, 
  all the ones with - stan are added onto to the name of the primary ethnic group in that country , like macar ( hungarian ) yunan ( greek , ionian ) h\u0131rvat / hrvat ( croat ) . 
  the ones without stan had alternatives similar to the original , like romanya i guess . 
  but the country names are not completely logical/consistent , for example by that logic albania should be arnavutistan instead of with the turkic suffix - luk , and there 's a lot of weird ones like portekiz , as if saying portugal like everyone else would be a problem for turks, 
  the ones that immigrated after the islamic revolution are very different from most iranians , they came from a segment of well educated , not very conservative middle class iranians who eventually mostly turned very secular and pro western in opposition to the newly founded theocracy they came from . 
  iran is still definitely conservative as a whole , and i do n't think you 'll find many even secular people who do n't dislike israel and us foreign policy quite a lot . 
  and i would object a lot to the government being even somewhat progressive in the region , the people compared to afghanistan , pakistan and gulf countries sure , but not the government . 
  after the saudis there 's not really anyone nearby to beat them if we 're talking about crazy islamic policies . 
  public hangings of minors and gays , religious police walking around making sure women wear hijab , raiding underground parties , [ stoning ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stoning#iran ) , amputations , flogging , bad religious freedom for non shia muslims and terrible for followers of non abrahamic religions , the list goes on . 
  and the political freedom is also shit, 
  \u00d6zil does n't speak great turkish either , so if he does n't speak german at a near native level it 's some weird personal problem he has, 
  i was n't aware of that , but it 's obvious that the shah and a similarly pro western iranian government was out of the question at that point , and it imo makes more sense to blame the west for toppling mossadegh and the support of the shah for the rise of khomeini 's iran rather than some potential unlikely to succeed meddling during the revolution . 
  the shah can very easily be called a western puppet , the west had no interest whatsoever in him being toppled , i 'm sorry but the revolution was very popular among the people , there was also a lot of more moderate islamic leftists and many other groups backing it until they got cracked down by khomeini later on . 
   that 's how we got iran . 
  western leaders did n't even bother looking up what chomeini stood for , they just saw that he was very successful at what he did . 
  khomeini lead an islamic revolution against the shah who was a strongly backed by the west and very brutal against his people , which along with the toppling of mossadegh was the reason for the strong anti-american and western sentiment of khomeini . 
  the west did n't back him at all, 
   the `` islamic golden age '' is the period after they conquer the most developped regions on earth - those of the eastern roman empire , and utilize what they find there . 
  that was done by the ottomans when that age was practically over , so this is false . 
  more like have his bodyguards drag the guy from the edge of the bridge to his car and talk to him while on the phone at the same time . 
  such a great guy, 
  the invasion was to prevent that happening and to protect turkish cypriots from attacks by greek cypriots is what he means . 
  the turkish part , ak\u0131nc\u0131 : `` i wish that the new year will bring permanent peace , tranquility and welfare to all cypriots . 
  happy new years '' anastasiades in turkish ( some parts of it were n't fully comprehensible , had to look it up ) : `` i wish that the new year will again permit us greek and turkish cypriots to live in peace in our once again united homeland '' they wished merry christmas in greek im pretty sure, 
  i never said that , of course they are slavs closest to their neighbours , but the same way croats and serbs are not the same , bosniaks are different from croatians and serbs and not only because of religion , read that link , scholars and historians know it better than us , most bosniaks were never orthodox or catholic if you bother to read it . 
  i know they are secular muslims or atheists which is good, 
  why do you open a thread based on your retarded ideas from serbian propaganda ? 
  most bosniaks were not orthodox nor catholic before the ottomans came , so they are n't croatian or serbian muslims , they are simply bosniaks no matter if they are religious or not . 
  that 's interesting , could also be antiochian greek christian ( antakyal\u0131 rum ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antiochian_greek_christians or veery unlikely a maronite https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maronites but yeah probably armenian :d fuck why have i never been to hatay . . 
  the guy was paraphrasing , it has no importance whether he says we must look into it or fix it . 
  you are in serious denial if you understand that quote as anything but our supporters are uneducated idiots who have less reason to like us as they get educated . 
  see this is why people dont take you idiots seriously .

what happens if i am a turkish atheist ? 
  i guess i can just pretend to be a christian . 
  then we 'll see how you guys can make constantinople great again :d, 
  these are all good questions i think, 
   the text reads further , `` ( the turks ) will be destroyed . 
  they will be eradicated because they are a nation that was built without god 's blessing . 
  one third of the turks will go back to where they came from , the depths of turkey . 
  one third will be saved because they will become christians , and the other third will be killed in this war . '' well at least we get to live if we become christians ( ; _ , 
  probably because they know most things about us already, 
  you did n't see the `` why will russia beat turkey '' part . . 
  i am disappointed in you greeks , i thought we were friends now . 
  he is better ; but he is as neo-ottomanist as erdogan if not more and being a neo-ottomanist turk is enough to be qualified as insane in my opinion . 
   arabs ...  good in bed ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
   he is not behind neo-ottomanism read his book , he is even more neo-ottomanist than erdogan . 
  he just recently called macedonia 's capital `` the same as bursa for the turkish people . '', 
  he is as insane as erdogan , just not corrupt . 
  yeah the two sentences were seperate points , i do n't like hillary either . 
  i personally am really pissed at you for not voting bernie . 
  donald trump in my eyes is literally american erdogan : an anti-establishment populist , narcissist , conservative that worships money so be careful with that ... 
  every single neon jungle music video is filled with turkish comments because of one japanese girl , turkish guys love japanese girls . 
  it really triggers me when people blatantly lie and call it journalism . 
  i really do n't know how this is going to work out , we are going to have to watch and see . 
  - protection of private information/data - reformation of laws that deal with war on terror to better protect the rights of minorities - transparency on political party financing , new devices to battle corruption i probably butchered these while translating ; but hopefully you get the idea . 
  i think the bird is named after the country, 
  69 objectives were passed , there are 3 left and today is the last day for them . 
  we ca n't know if it 's a legitimate concern or not . 
  do you know for fact that this deal ca n't create millions of illegal turkish workers in europe ? 
  i do n't , i do n't know how anyone can . 
  unfortunately yes . 
  australians , chinese and japanese all describe poland and turkey similarly . 
  poland opposes china turkey opposes china poland loves japan turkey loves japan why is poland called poland ? 
  why is turkey called turkey ? 
  weird . 
  this is probably a very ignorant thing to ask ; but why was austria-hungary a thing when austrians are ethnic germans that speak german ? 
  hdp ( pro-kurdish party ) mps left the parliament chanting '' [ biji serok apo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kekwmdymesm&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;a ) '' = `` long live apo '' . 
  apo = abdullah ocalan , the imprisoned pkk leader . 
  this is n't an isolated incident by the way , these kinds of fights happen weekly in the parliament now between right-wingers and the hdp . 
  it 's hilarious if you ask me because it perfectly reflects the mental state turkish people are in right now . 
  most of them do , besides the ones in southeast that are not assimilated . 
  by the way , expect maybe a couple million illegal workers europe . 
  most turks here will claim that it wo n't happen ; but it will . 
  smart of them i guess . 
  if i was a politican that wanted to be in power i would too , just maybe a little more subtly so i do n't scare voters away . 
  yup . 
  these magazines existed long before erdogan became pm but they are brave for doing what they are doing . 
  there 's nothing particularly good about being a muslim . 
  islam teaches you that being clean is very important , so muslims are in general clean and that 's cool i guess . 
  we are taught in turkey that being overly religious and connected to islam led to the collapse of our empire ; because we never innovated and did n't contribute to modern society in a lot of meaningful ways . 
  i obviously agree with you that muslims are n't devils like most people here believe they are ; but most muslims are conservative and uneducated and that should change . 
  i was just joking : x, 
  yes and we are brutal savages . 
  thanks , i now understand how the eu accession process works . 
  i do n't think it makes sense for turkey to join anyways . 
  it would be like russia joining the eu . 
  but cyprus joining the eu makes as little sense as turkey joining ... 
  it 's in asia . 
  i actually think when a kurdistan is formed in one way or another the eu will accept them as well just to fuck with us . 
  it will be cyprus # 2 for us . 
  no need to post these news anywhere at this point , southeast turkey is literally a war zone . 
  then the middle east would have been a very different place today . 
  though i think it was almost impossible to keep the ottoman empire together at that point . 
  maybe the empire would 've been broken up anyways ; but there would n't be a state of israel . 
  there are infinite amount of different things that could 've happened if germany would have won ww1 . 
  what a fucked up way to present the article . 
  you know we are currently dealing with 3 million syrians and the kurdish problem ? 
  that makes you disapprove of diffeent language , race and immigration . 
  we are being attacked weekly by either isis or pkk , you ca n't expect a society that is under so much attack to be tolerant . 
  on the homosexuality issue , most people associate that with pedophilia ; but we are not openly criminalizing it or doing anything about it . 
  we got social and cultural issues as turkey is predominantly a conservative country yes ; but you are still better off being a homosexual in turkey compared to in russia . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35194359 there are laws in turkey protecting homosexuals from hate crimes ... and no government , even the ultra conservatives like erdogans government try to change these laws or make life harder for the lgbt community in any way , besides breaking up pride parades with teargas but they break up literally every protest anyways . 
  al-nusra and fsa . 
  unfortunately turkmen and sunni-muslims in the area that fight in turkey 's favor are aligned with al-nusra for the most part . 
  i guess now that they withdrew from syria they need to intervene somewhere else . 
  the world economy is suffering from low growth , 4.2 these days is pretty great . 
   however , european muslims were n't called turks . 
  they were still called by their ethnic groups . 
  they were for the most part ( besides yugoslavia i guess ) in turkey they still are . 
  laz people that live in the black sea region in turkey are the least turkic people ever ; they look like a combination of russians + greeks + jews . 
  they were christians before 17th century when they converted to islam under ottoman rule , since then they are called turkish . 
  muslims in europe were called turks by almost everyone , that 's why during population exchanges muslims were sent to turkey and christians to greece/macedonia . 
  your own map proves it anyways , % 5 central asian turkic ethnicity at most in turkey . 
  this map wo n't really make greeks here mad ; but nationalistic greeks pride themselves at being the opposite of turks . 
   do n't know what they teach you in turkey . 
  in turkey they do n't teach us anything about ethnic backgrounds , our education system tries to convince us that we are all ethnically the same - which is ridiculous considering we are the successors of an empire . 
  dictators that need popular vote are the worst . 
  this map will piss off greeks as much as your comment . 
  most people that live in eastern europe do n't know that their ancestors that converted to islam were called turkish and ottomans that were christians were called other things , mostly greek . 
  armenians look almost identical to turks , even more than greeks . 
  it will not change much , the saudis got erdogan 's back . 
  they will do their best to keep him in power so they can build mosques all around the world together spreading wahhabism . 
  germanic nations are the best in all history , besides that holocaust thing . 
  op literally retook constantinople, 
  i think the comment section here proves the article wrong ... lol . 
  it 's a weird french word : <, 
  he meant `` laicite '' turkey is a laic country ( supposedly ) not secular . 
  that 's what he meant , the seculars in turkey are blowing this way out of proportion . 
  edit : corrected the word, 
  similar thing happened to some of my turkish friends that were visiting poland . 
  they almost got assaulted because they were turkish in a restaurant , the owner did n't do anything about it . 
  i 'll just say czechia and poland are two countries where i would n't admit to being turkish unless i have to .

it is not that simple . 
   the same flag of muhammed well ... 
  it 's the seal of prophet muhammed , not his flag and we never used the same flag . 
  i 've seen so many laden videos on the tv and internet and never heard him talking about that but what does he got anything to do with the isis ? 
  his own group is currently fighting the isis . 
  extremist/takfiri muslims consider anyone who prays at shrines and tombs `` infidels '' , so they definitely would hate ottoman emperors and i do n't really believe they all care about sieges and conquests of ottoman empire . 
  i did a quick `` ctrl + f '' and search the term `` reported '' in the article . 
  there is no official statement on any of their claims . 
  so , we do n't really know if the isis wants to bomb a neutral country , however i would n't be surprised if they wanted . 
  extremist groups , such as the isis , are not famous for making sense . 
  you absolutely have no idea what you are talking about . 
  vienna is not symbolic for muslims , it is for the ottoman empire . 
  the isis fan boys do n't even consider ottoman empire an islamic one . 
  ottoman emperors used to have their own tombs . 
  do you know what the isis is doing with tombs ? 
   it was n't `` their house '' . 
  it was ** literally ** their own house . 
  thousands of palestinians were expelled from their own houses . 
   if the arabs had accepted it instead of spending decades trying to destroy israel , the whole clusterfuck in the middle east could have been avoided . 
  you are not serious ... are you ? 
  would you give away your own house to a group of ultra-religious people because their god tells them it 's their own ? 
  i had to editorialize the title because ahmet davutoglu is not a well-known politician in europe . 
  i hope everyone will actually read the article before commenting on the issue . 
  `` the da\u011fl\u0131ca military guard post had been attacked with rocket-propelled grenades by the pkk for three days , and the turkish military airstrikes came after the last attack that took place on oct. 13 . 
  f-16 and f-4 jets flying from malatya and diyarbak\u0131r bombarded pkk positions in the da\u011fl\u0131ca district . '', 
  sure but your point is a separate issue . 
  there will be always some people who will try to use popular ideas as a tool to promote their own sick ideologies . 
  that means the title is pretty misleading . 
  this is like saying `` condemning israel is anti-semitic '' , which is completely wrong . 
  condeming the isis is not islamophobic at all . 
  [ the british muslim community has issued a fatwa condemning the isis and the uk jihadis ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/isis-terror-threat-leading-british-muslims-issue-fatwa-condemning-terror-group-9702042.html ), 
   if google does n't get everything wrong , apparently , it gets everything wrong . 
  the statement was not made by \u00d6calan . 
  actually selahattin demirtas ( leader of the kurdish party ) told the media that abdullah \u00d6calan is calling for dialogue . 
  ( edit : i believe \u00d6calan does n't give a damn about peace but that 's what their party leader said ) i 'm sorry for not finding any english article on these domestic issues but yeah , the pkk threatened turkey and an attack took place 4 days later . 
   after what is a very obvious false flag attack on one of his own posts the attack took place just four days after a branch of the pkk threatened turkey . 
  http://t24.com.tr/haber/taktan-saldiri-aciklamasi-kobane-yangin-yerine-cevrilmisken-turkiye-metropolleri-rahat-uyumayacak,273328 ( turkish article ) obvious false flag attack indeed . 
  if anyone wants to have some info on the photos used in this article : photo 1 : it 's flag of * tawheed * , even the if ( islamic front ) , a syrian rebel group which fights against the isis , use it . 
  so , it is not really a sign of isis support . 
  photo 2 : it 's the stamp of prophet mohammed . 
  it 's a historical item for all muslims , not only for the isis fanboys . 
  our support of daesh ? 
  we 've bombed deash inside syria way before the coalition forces ; http://english.alarabiya.net/en/news/middle-east/2014/01/30/turkish-army-strikes-isis-convoy-in-syria.html we 've also deported hundreds of potential daesh fighters ; http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/1.615352, 
  you are welcome !, 
  we saved entire civilian population of kobani and left only ** ypg members ** to fight isis members . 
  far-right europeans , like yourself , freak out when entire europe get 3,000 refugees in a month but we 've received tens of thousands of refugees in few weeks !, 
  they attacked an office of k\u00f6y-der , which is a ngo related to h\u00fcda-par . 
  they killed four ngo members who were giving free meat to poor kurdish families in the region after eid al adha . 
  they 've also killed two completely random arab citizens on the same day . 
  they killed four kurdish ngo workers in this attack alone . 
  pkk supporters are gone completely crazy . 
  they started to target even openly anti-isis kurds , just because they do n't support pkk 's ideology . 
  one must also remember that the kurds are not one single political entity . 
  there are many armed kurdish groups with different ideologies and these guys are waiting for a reason to kill each other . 
  yesterday kurdish hezbollah and the pkk clashed in kurdish cities of turkey and 18 people died from both sides . 
  there are also armed islamist-kurdish groups in syria , then in northern iraq you have kdp-puk rivality which led them into a civil war in 1994 . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraqi_kurdish_civil_war all these armed groups will be fighting each other in order to control oil-rich kurdish regions in an independent kurdistan . 
  you should update your info on this issue . 
  this is not a simple turks vs kurds fight . 
  kurdish hezbollah and the pkk clashed all night long yesterday . 
  both sides suffered at least 12 casualties in total . 
  europeans tend to think that kurds are one single political entity but this is far from the reality . 
  the op presents no evidence about pro-isis people 's ethnicity . 
  we ca n't simply assume that they are turkish . 
  i hear them but they speak with a kurdish accent ( ambulans cagirin ) . 
  the video is a total mess , you ca n't even say which side is pro-isis and even your own fucking source does n't mention turks !, 
  he blames turks for the incident but his source says nothing about turks . 
   many others killed by turkish police by shooting at the prosters . 
  source ? 
   kurdish islamist who are pro-isis and the turkish state . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  hudapar is islamist but anti-isis . 
  http://rudaw.net/turkish/kurdistan/100820143 ( the article is in turkish and from a kurdish website ), 
  turks ? 
  the guys in the video were speaking turkish with a heavy kurdish accent . 
  where the hell did you get the info that these are ** pro-isis turks ** ? 
   they all get free , instant citizenship if they come to sweden . 
  citizenship ? 
  really ? 
  or do you mean residence permit ? 
   they 're strengthening sunni iraq specifically to weaken the kurds . 
  what the hell ? 
  turkey supported the regional government in kurdistan against the sectarian government of baghdad in their oil deal . 
  assadists say we support al-nusra . 
  the isis says we support the fsa . 
  the pkk says we support the isis . 
  a bunch of tribal , nationalist and ultra-religious idiots are killing each other and since they can not blame their beloved leaders for any defeat , they blame turkey , the us , israel , etc. 
   do you know the stories behind the people that were attacked ? 
  i honestly did n't know that was a risk . 
  one of them was a guy from tajikistan . 
  he was returning home after morning prayers and got attacked by a group of white ( finnish ? ), 
  men at a railway station . 
  he did n't even know why they attacked and what they were saying while punching him because he was pretty new in finland and could n't speak the language . 
  another one was a guy from iraq . 
  he got attacked by three men . 
  they called him a nigger and accused him of ruining their country . 
  they had a knife and tried to stab him but he managed to run away . 
  finland is a peaceful country , the crime rate is very low and your average finnish jussi would never think of attacking a foreigner but every now and then you can hear stories like these ones . 
  i also would like to tell my story regarding the issue . 
  i would be lying if i say i 've never witnessed racism/xenophobia in europe . 
  i was called a terrorist , a fucking iraqi refugee and even a fucking jew by the locals ( apparently i look too middle-eastern ) but i 've never got physically attacked by anyone and been treated equally in all of my job interviews .

  i would n't be surprised if two turkish ships crash ( by totaly accident ofc ) in the entrance of straits . 
  youtube and twitter are usually banned on political issues . 
  some states requested twitter to delete some contents and they removed it . 
  while twitter ignored turkey 's requests for quite some time but when turkey finally shut it down they now remove any content turkish state requests . 
  and yes i do think its stupid as fuck . 
  instead of banning these sites just work on your public diplomacy in the first place so you wouldnt have a shitty image . 
  in english ; http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/explosion-occurs-near-istanbuls-bayrampasa-metro-station-one-injured.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=91946&amp;newscatid=341, 
  ** more than half ** of turkey did n't want erdogan or akp neither but here we are . 
  oh btw i read the exact same comments here with turkish publicsphere . 
  who comes next ? 
  who can be trusted ? 
  other parties lack canditate etc. 
  correct but i doubt 94 percent of the people take ` abdest ' since mosques are completely empty except fridays . 
  not really . . there is this article which prooves the case written by the some guy from the other side of the earth . 
  its all documanted because an isis commander told him so . 
  oh and lets not forget the senior officals who doesnt want to give their names . 
  turkey is only the 18th largest economy , they need isis oil so badly . 
  that and russia bombs turkmen districts . 
  refugee cities are not planned to be establish on rojava . 
  you are being extremely ignorant and the entire northern syria does not belong to the kurds . 
  do u honestly believe that ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_turkey http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/start.do http://www.kultur.gov.tr/en,36567/tourism-statistics.html http://www.studyinturkey.com/content/sub/mobility_statistic.aspx http://www.turkishculturalfoundation.org/pages.php?id=253, 
  eu should have support or at least let turkey build refugee cities in northern syria instead of supporting ypg to change syria 's demographics and conquer all the way to the mediterian sea so they would n't be the most isolated country ever existed . 
  this way u would n't have any refugee crisis in the first place . 
  if turks kill greek miniority in a civil-war in turkey with the help of russia and meanwhile turkey shoots down a greek plane and then greece changes his engagement rules on greek-turkish border . 
  oh but why stop there ? 
  even after that greece warns turkey for a straight two months . 
  yeah probably they would have every right to shoot it down . 
  no to racism ( except when it comes to the turks because fk them ) . 
  thats actually somewhat true if turks integrated with europeans they would close all of its ties with the middle east . 
  at least for the sake of secularism and liberal democracy . 
  no peace untill russia admits raki is much better drink than vodka . 
  to convert to islam . 
  to cause to conform to islamic law or precepts . 
  which is not happening at all due to fact that people are already muslims and there is no islamic law . 
  turkish republic was established as a secular state . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz-kajhkqmu  official muslim percentage has stayed the same for decades and has simply always been inaccurate . 
  you claim is based on what ? 
  any proof ? 
   your last question is what the article is all about , as it attempt to claim that akp is reforming state education by the principle of islamism . 
  these imam hatips were opened by ataturk and his chp by the way and nothing to do with akp . 
  we overreact on these matters because akp cant be trusted and it would prevent them from going too deep . 
  imam hatips had 500k students during 90s now its 450k . 
  by the way turkish population increased by 50 percent from that time to today . 
  agreed , these peope are no fanatics but pragmatists . 
  no not really . 
  noone ever got jailed for being atheist . 
  there is actually an atheism association approved by the government . 
  google ` ateizm derne\u011fi ' for more information . 
   a political ideology of conquering the public , political sphere for a religious based discourse instead of enlightened based discourse , right ? 
  i forgot to mention that these guys dont promote islam or anything aswell . 
  they just justify akp actions with the claim of ` turkish republic benefited x action ' . 
  if you like to learn more about turkish culture and politics i can explain with a wall of text but every little piece of your post is incorrect . 
   official 99 percent should be roughly the same as the way the religion demographics is automatically registered hasnt changed in turkey and it never was that accurate . 
  wrong . 
  you are missin the point that turkish people had no idea about islam and they still do n't . 
  only 8 percent of turkish population reads quran . 
  turkish people have the wrong idea of ` arabs do n't understand the islam ' and we turkik countries do . 
  so islamization would lead people to abandon islam as it already started ( thanks to the internet ) . 
  turkish politicians are well aware of this fact so they would never force islamization hence why akp made 0 laws based on islam . 
   turkey has been a secular state since 1982 . 
  lol . 
   the word `` islamization '' doesnt always stand for an increase of muslim population . 
  it always does stand for an increase of muslim population since introducing ( or forcing for some cults ) islam to the non-muslims is mandatory . 
   it can also mean `` imposition of islamist political or social system '' as is the case here . 
  when did akp do such a thing ? 
  a single example is more than enough to convince me about akp 's islamization . 
  theocracy has never been a thing in turkish culture . 
  even during ottoman era monarch had the power over all . 
  unlike christians with pope . 
  turkish government tells the imam what to talk and not talk about . 
  if they say something like totally based on quran and islam but the government doesnt approve they are immediately fired . 
  i would also like you to link me the islamic laws made by akp in a total of 13 years . 
  http://i.ensonhaber.com/resimler/diger/rasim_3.jpg these are the top akp supporters ( being paid millions of euros ) and they are all drinking alcohol lol . 
  the guy on the right goes to debates with his whiskey bottles . 
  religious my ass . 
  irrevelant . 
  france and us supplied opposition groups aswell . 
  such a stupid word to use lol . 
  we didnt even know what atheism was back then in 90s . 
  if anything happens about religion in turkey that people abandon islam . 
  presidency of religious affairs claimed that there are 5 million atheists in turkey a year ago or two . 
  as far as i know there are like 30 million muslim population in europe . 
  i 'm not saying there is no correlation in between islam and violance but if all muslims were jihadist lunatics you would see an attack everyday . 
  ca n't believe a comment which implies that ataturk killed innocent armenians gets upvoted on a platfrom which supposed to have an intellectual group of people . 
  considering ataturk had a whole new turkish republic in his mind ( even when he was a young military officer ) and he knew he would n't be able to change the people and their perspectives about secularism and the other western ideals he admired of . 
  he changed the education system in a more proggresive way so the new generation would the real face of this new turkish republic . 
  in other words turkish republic belonged to the children . 
  23 april - the holiday of national sovereignty and children . 
  facepalm . 
  where did u hear that from ? 
  i think its safe to say that people wont try to move arround 3 billion people all over the world just because their lands belonged to the some other nation in the first place . 
  not sure why are being downvoted but thats completely true . 
  lots of historians claims ottomans to be succesor of byzantine . 
  not to metion after nearly 500 years half of the city was still non-muslim . 
  hey thats rude , we stopped being foreign invaders centuries ago . 
  there are reports coming out about isis just surrendered . 
  a shocking footage prooves the claim that a high ranked isis commander just yelled ` not the belgian aircraft carrier ' and dropped his gun and then started to flee . 
  they should go to iran for holidays since turks are islamists according to putin and iranians are progressive and a close ally . 
  good luck finding night clubs and wearing bikinis on the beaches and streets .

  * 50 % is oppressing the other 50 % in every way . 
  * if you are erdo opponent , there 's no guarantee that you wo n't be detained in the morning . 
  * journalists , opposition party leaders and pm 's are jailed . 
  * 100.000 + have been fired or arrested for being `` g\u00fclenist '' . 
  you name it . 
  tyranny of the majority or just a tyranny . 
  nazis are n't responsible but it was a gift from god for nazis to achieve their goals and purge the opposition , just like erdo clowns . 
  i do n't think the democratic system is functional at all . 
  all the opposition parties can do is simply resigning from mp , maybe even close the party because it 's pointless to be in parliament nowadays . 
  the coup was reichstag fire 2.0 . 
  my friend , you are so optimistic if you still talk about things like voters , elections , party etc. 
  after erdo goes full the night of the long knives . 
  chp has never been a smart party since ataturk 's death . 
  arresting mp 's at 02.00 am . 
  this is what coup looks like . 
  after hdp they 'll come for chp mp 's most likely . 
  it 's feels fucking horrible to see all this mess and not being able to do anything . 
  it 's impossible for him to be more popular than he is now and yes even after the coup attempt . 
  because he successfully alienated everyone who do n't vote for him . 
  oh erdo , wish you were always like that . 
  many turks around you are shit then , or ignorant enough to see him as good guy . 
  i suppose you 're talking about diaspora turks so advise them to live 1 year , only 1 year in turkey and let them see what their good guy actually is . 
  the empire was already collapsing in the speed of light before ww1 and that collapse started with this war . 
  i mean , russians were only 10 ~ km away from capturing the capital and it was n't for british , the ottoman empire would 've been gone in as early as 1878 . 
  truly the most important war in the late era of ottoman empire . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  naaaah i prefer calf . 
  now it 's our duty to abolish the second sultanate . 
  every akp opponent is supporting some imaginary terrorist organisation you know . 
  give me a break . 
  welcome to turkey , questioning is forbidden . 
  coup plotters were no better than erdo because they are also islamist and their policy would 've been no different than erdo 's , maybe their foreign policy would be much more sane but the rest would 've been the same . 
  tbh i 'd rather to live under some enlightened despot 's rule than erdo . 
  \\  hdp \\  protecting turkey \\  anytime good fucking joke . 
  hdp and their precedents were always `` fuck turkey , biji kurdistan '' party . 
  oh , at least democracy won . 
  both are ruling their countries for 14-15 years . 
  putin succeed , erdo failed . 
  there 's no way he can successfully brainwash his opponents after all these mess . 
  i posted a guillotine photo . 
  well if anything , the youth are non-religious , generally oppose akp and most importantly , they know how to use internet very well . 
  getting information is n't a problem for them . 
  people just do n't trust media . 
  he can only convince certain amount of people who are also akp voters , not everyone . 
  he knows it , tries to block communication tools and information sources , people find a way to get them . 
  social media is a crucial factor for any ordinary citizen to get information and unlike traditional media , you can browse them even though they 're blocked thanks to dns and vpn . 
  foreign people may find it difficult but there 's no media channels like cnn or whatever gets viewers from every kind of people . 
  our tv channels occured by lots of fox news and nbc news so people watch certain tv channels or just do n't watch tv at all . 
  why did i wrote these things ? 
  because turkey 's future is dark but turkish people is n't brainwashed like russian people . 
  when i see russian comments , most of them are pro-putin , those are the educated ones who can communicate with people in english and have proper internet . 
  if the situation in turkey was something like that , then i would 've fled the country in no time . 
  but it 's not , you can find many erdo opponents on internet and on the streets . 
  his mindtricks do n't work for the other half of the country . 
   maybe fake a scandal with all that media that he controls . 
  happens in every election process . 
  they generally target one party/leader/group to launch a smear campaign like there 's no tomorrow . 
  akp voterbase believes it in speed of light ( to be fair they believe everything akp feeds them ) , the opposition voterbase simply rejects whatever they say and label `` propaganda '' . 
  so no change happens . 
  what would he say or do ? 
  he already created internal ( g\u00fclen ) and external ( pretty much every western country ) threats , he always does dirty tricks against his opponents , nearly every media outlet is , directly or indirectly , akp mouthpiece . 
  he already did whatever he could do , that 's the current situation . 
  the only thing left for him to do is closing the opposition parties , jailing the leaders and cause civil war/revolution . 
   do n't most liberals vote for erdo by the way ? 
  some do , some do n't . 
  europhiles despise erdo after gezi protests , muslim apologist types still like him . 
  their vote is irrelevant because they have no population to be counted as demographic but they 're important on party-level politics . 
   notice that it does n't really matter what one-two million turks would think . 
  try 40 million . 
  and if you think people are apathetic to what 's regularly happening in turkey , you are crazy . 
  i mean , it 's not even possible to see things and say `` alright , whatever '' unless you are rich enough to save yourself when shit hits the fan . 
   i used to be hopeful about them . 
  it 's a shame they never became anything more than another kurdish party . 
  they probably defended pkk excessively and got caught between a rock and a hard place after the ceasefire between gov. 
  and pkk ended erdo knew it well , that 's why he restarted the conflict . 
   why this clusterfuck ? 
  i hope they find a solution and elect a capable leader that can take on erdogan . 
  i explained the clusterfuck . 
  chp is an ideology-based party but anti-akp type ideology-based party , so liberals do n't want kemalists leader , social democrats do n't want liberal leader etc. 
  i am in turkey but yes i 'm indecided on whether the last sentence should stay or not . 
   mhp became controlled opposition after bah\u00e7eli purged all his opponents with the government 's help  hdp decided not to be turkey 's party and turned back to classic kurdish party rhetoric . 
  i doubt they can make it into the parliament in the next election . 
   chp ultimate clusterfuck between party voterbase and party itself . 
  the leader , k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu , is persona non grata for being useless against akp but he also silences his opponents , although not as hard as mhp . 
  still has a chance for leadership to change , many alternative figures are being talked about . 
  add : i forgot to talk about party voterbase . 
  the voterbase occured by numerous demographics , from non-islamist centre-right voters to kemalists from social democrats to liberals ; and all want chp to be more like them , hence there is no `` party view '' anymore , a mp says something pro-kurdish , another says something g\u00fclen-friendly , another one says nationalist things , totally different one talks about liberalism etc. 
  finally everyone agreed that k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu needs to go but everyone is divided on who should replace him . 
  i do n't know what you 're refer to by saying `` the people '' . 
  if you talk about his opponents in turkey , we called it `` whoever wins , we lose '' . 
  both sides were as islamist as the other , it 's not like g\u00fclen-orchestrated coup might ve brought liberty to the country . 
  edit : i thought i should delete my comment on revolution because well , i do n't want to get trouble from the state . 
   erdo ! = nation i wan na hug you right now . 
  comments like this give me cancer because those who do n't vote for him want him to die in a painful death . 
  he 's a putin wannabe who ignores the fact that he has nowhere near the approval rate as high as putin 's , he can not brainwash the people as putin does etc. 
  he does n't favour sharia . 
  he prefers turkey not to be secular but not to be sharia state either . 
  he 's scum of the earth , really . 
  considering they aborted elections of university rectors , and now erdo will appoint them with this decree law , it does n't sound so difficult . 
  he has all the power and he can do everything via edi . .

  [ only this guy . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patrona_halil ), 
  it 's always said that the turks converted to islam peacefully and it was compatible with the tengriism ( a sort of shamanism ) . 
  then we learn about the ottomans and all the `` good '' they did like converting people to islam , taking over anatolia . . 
  in the end they say the ottomans conquered constantinople and were very peaceful , everything was great as soon as the war was over , there was no looting . 
  then they talk about the balkans and north aftrica a bit , where ottomans were peaceful and accepting of others . 
  there is almost no talk of the harem ( ca n't blame them for not talking about masses of young ladies in front of hormonal teenagers ) or the dev\u015firme . 
  they are always shown in a good light until the lale devri , and afterwards it 's like the sultans become the enemies of the public . 
  this is to set up ww1 and the young turk movement and ataturk is emphasized like crazy . 
  months about every little step he took , everywhere he went , where was he at what date . . armenian genocide is obviously not mentioned at all . 
  apparently they were traitors and conspired with the russians against the sultan so they had to be `` taken care of '' . 
  one sentence in the textbook , i think it was . 
  we do n't have much covered after ww2 , so there is nothing about the coups and treatment of kurds either , and this seems to be a big problem for the general public . 
  my history teacher was a little biased though , he wanted the old days with tulips and poetry back again ... edit : also the only non-turkish history we learn about is ancient civilizations of anatolia and a little of china in the 5th century . 
  there is an emphasis on `` terrifying battle-ready turkic/mongolic horse riders with spears !! '' . 
  the cyprus issue is very one-sided also . 
  the textbook says the turks were being massacred so the military stepped in with minimal violence and stay there to protect the north half . 
  [ this ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=1p0q62yfrg_dg36iyjbkdmc_dyxlb5n5c5utwyqxi24g ) is also very creative . 
  istanbul is still governed by ankara . . :(, 
  when a point is closer to one capital than any other , it is inside that capital 's area . 
  for example most of wales is closer to dublin than london , so it is inside dublin 's area . 
  some people think this is 12:30 . 
  they are the worst kind of people . 
  12:00 - 13:00 - midday ( \u00f6\u011fle ) 13:00 - 16:00 - afternoon ( \u00f6\u011fleden sonra ) 16:00 - 20:00 - evening ( ak\u015fam\u00fcst\u00fc ) 20:00 - 22:00 - between evening and night ( ak\u015fam ) 22:00 - 03:00 - night ( gece ) most people call the time between midnight and sunrise `` sabah\u0131n k\u00f6r\u00fc '' , it means the dull time of the morning , but i did n't add it .

  yes , but that 's a language map , i did n't link a language map because the original point was that languages and ethnicities are unrelated . 
  my first map classified people as slavic , indo-european and turkic , which is n't a great way to sort things but it put all turkic people in the same group , as related people . 
  though it also put slavic and indo-european as different things , so i do n't know why . . ^ ^ i ^ ^ think ^ ^ this ^ ^ is ^ ^ turning ^ ^ into ^ ^ a ^ ^ pointless ^ ^ argument ^ ^ and ^ ^ i ^ ^ feel ^ ^ like ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ right ^ ^ but ^ ^ ca n't ^ ^ prove ^ ^ it,

  the disambiguation page 's third link is about ethnicity . 
  and turkic peoples at least are definitely related . 
  europeans are mostly indo-europeans . 
  this includes armenians , iranians , and some people in india . 
  turkey is mostly made of turkic people . 
  of course this is n't all true in reality , you could argue what the actual genetics of turkey and iran are . 
  ( sorry if i made mistakes , i 'm on a phone , there 's more on wikipedia ), 
  that number is n't from the census but from the id cards , i think . 
  for example , it counts most of my friends and me as muslim , even if we are n't , because we were recorded as muslims from birth and it 's very inconvenient to change it . 
  i 'm sure the number is high , but more like 92 % or something . 
  at first , `` lady be quiet '' could be excused if he said susun instead of sus which would be politer because it 's second person plural instead of singular .

  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_gilbumzyw ) is the video , he says at 0:15 : `` han\u0131mefendi sus , bir kad\u0131n olarak sus '' . 
  sus is basically a rude way of saying be quiet , but i would n't actually translate it as shut up . 
  so he is saying , `` lady be quiet ; as a lady , be quiet '' as a better translation i think .

  source ? 
  they meant the treaty of sevres . 
  there was no ottoman empire at that point . 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/treatyofsevres_ ( corrected ) . png, 
  for us , it was obvious a few hours after the attempt . 
  we do n't need to assume , because there is evidence . 
  the people in the military who were known to support g\u00fclen participated in the coup , the rest did n't . 
  how is there data for greek islands but not for the rest of the country ?

  yes , gar is from french , the \u0131 is a suffix . 
  after writing that i did some research ( aka google ) so now i 'm not sure if philosophy was mandatory or not . 
  anyway , yes , a lot of people in the class had n't known much about ancient greece , so we had to learn history and literature too along with the philosophy for it to make sense . 
  that may or may not have been our teacher 's initiative , but to be honest i do n't remember much . 
  on the other hand , we definitely also learn about him in literature , i 'm sure of it , but literature classes are 95 % focused on turkish literature . 
  in any case i 'd say at least 20 % of people would have a general idea of who homer is , though that 's not saying much and i would be an awful source . 
  what ? 
  philosophy lessons were mandatory when i was in high school , i do n't think the number would be that low .

  did n't know turkey got so big and strong that we can literally decide what belgium can allow and ca n't . 
   not really . 
  quite easy actually . 
  you have the conservative kurds - and you have the liberal , open-minded , progressive , and jihadi-grinding kurds . 
  which is what i 'm talking about there are kurdish factions with pretty much every viewpoint and all of them has their own private militants that fought eachother at some time . 
  example you got kurdish hezbollah which is islamist kurds , you got pkk/pyd/pjak which are far-left confederalists , you got puk which are socialists and you got kdp which are conservative nationalists . 
   if you left the kurds out of the turkish elections , you 'd probably get 70-75 % of pro-akp ( erdogan ) turks ( actually similar to how turks in the diaspora voted , so a very reliable estimate ) . 
  the other 20-25 % of turks ( leave 5 % for other , non-kurdish minorities ) voting for all the other parties ( and most of those are also conservative or ultra-nationalist ) . 
  i 'm not sure why did you even wrote this . 
  how is this relevant ? 
   the `` true '' percentage of `` secular '' turks ( if we use chp , ataturk 's party , as indicator ) would be around 15 % i guess . 
  what exactly do you mean by `` secular '' and if you gon na base it on chp the percentage you 're looking for is 25 % which is what they got in the last elections . 
  if you mean secular literally like people who prefer a secular rule of law then your estimate is gravely wrong because akp is pro-secular as well and polls show that around 10 % of the population prefer a religious law over a secular one and i bet half of those do n't even know what sharia is like . 
  if you mean kemalist when you say secular then it is 25 % as i said before . 
   turkey is and has always been an islamist country . 
  the '' secular '' era was forced upon with brute force . 
  erdogan 's turkey is the real turkey . 
  that 's just false and literally r/badhistory bait even when ottoman days turkey was less islamist than countries like suadi arabia which is where we base islamism on . 
  ever heard of suadi rebellions in ottoman empire ? 
  ottoman sultan made their leader to listen to music prior to his execution because he believed that music was haram . 
  anyway even before ataturk 's reforms there were already attempts to secularize the empire and bring equality ( tanzimat era ) which was what people wanted so no he did n't force secularism what he forced was laicism and it was not forced with brute force it was forced without democracy . 
  and ? 
  i still do not see your point one bit . 
  how are the residents are involved did they vote for akp so they would cause this culture week to be banned ? 
  you 're not making any sense at all ... also where did gulen come from ? 
  and your proof is ? 
  i can also speculate and say the culture week was banned because authorities thought it will just be a pkk propaganda fest which will disrupt the peace in the city . 
  the site is already biased pro-kurd yet even the article does not mention anything about turkish minority being involved . 
  it 's you who 're getting desperate to pin this on belgian turks . 
  belgium is more pro-kurd that turk they never disallowed something just because it might upset turks . 
  the pkk tents in the middle of brussels is proof of that . 
  the local authorities probably not allowed the culture week because it 's foreign europe is not known to being kind or care about foreign cultures . 
  and ? 
  i said the residents are not involved not akp ... 
  nowhere in the article it 's pointed out that turkish residents had anything to do with it but sure when it comes to turks truth is irrelevant . 
  kurds are more split than balkans . 
  if you trust all of them you are also trusting the kdp which is on the side of erdogan . 
   `` at the same time , this state [ turkey ] is waging a war against kurdish people , committing crimes against humanity , and suppressing human rights activists , journalists , lawyers , politicians and in fact anyone who criticizes the akp [ justice & development party ] government and its president , '' the institute said in a statement . 
  i thought this was about culture ... 
  wow that 's pretty bad ... 
   when asked if they considered the islamic legal and moral code of sharia to be more important than the french republic 's laws , 29 percent of respondents answered `` yes . '', 
  the way the question was asked explains the number ofc for the religious person the law of god is more important than law of men . 
  retarded poll this does not mean 29 percent of french muslims want sharia to become the rule of law . 
  turkey does not have rotating presidency however pretty much every major party have greek assyrian and armenian mps except mhp . 
  it does n't matter how you refer it as such there are two different governments in the island and no side will give up themselves to the other without getting what they want and both sides want a one sided deal . 
  well that 's what greek cyprus pushing them in to if a deal is not made and trnc is not recognized internationally trnc will forever stuck being dependent on turkey and you can basically call it part of turkey with no hope of change . 
  what is your point ? 
  trnc only recognized by turkey ofc they 're fucking dependent they do everything though turkey ... 
  unless the international community recognizes or a deal is made between two sides it ca n't be helped . 
  well support is a strong word but the invasion itself was not illegal the staying of the army after that was which is why that resolution was passed . 
  lol why the hell not europe has nothing to do with the coup . 
  however european media really showed their true colors in this coup attempt . 
  dude did you even read what he said ? 
   it 's the army staying after the fact that 's a problem . 
  how the hell did you miss this part he even typed it bold ... 
  then what 's the point ? 
  recognize trnc and both sides should live happily separate . 
  your concerns is not unreasonable however it is unrealistic to expect that any of those conditions will change in the future maybe except turkish military leaving . 
  tsk staying is kinda silly since the whole excuse for them to be there is prevent the another ethnic violence . 
  well you are not exactly wrong however the situation is diffrent trnc is not joining turkey and they negotiate for themselves . 
  if they ca n't reach to a middle ground i do n't see the problem with 2 state solution . 
  both sides seems to be better of themselves when you consider that fact after 40 years there is barely any progress with unification . 
  i mean what is your solution ? 
  either both sides agree or they do n't . 
  you ca n't force one side to agree an unfair deal it 'll just lead the history repeating itself ... 
  why not ? 
  got any verse in quran saying women ca n't be imams ? 
  no we 're just too fucking lazy it takes 2 seconds to change you just fill some paper and they remove it . 
  the new ids wo n't have religion bar anyway . 
  it is only accurate if you do n't count all those 96 percent who believe there is a god muslim . 
  you can safely assume that half of this country is basically deist and just cultural muslim judging by how empty the mosques are . 
  it writes islam on mine as well never bothered to change it . 
  it 's going to be removed in the new id . 
  this was long time coming also your fears are unfounded there is no way the ethnic conflict will commence again . 
  as long as trnc agrees we should comply . 
  actually some of us have problem with supporting hamas i really wish we did n't . 
  at least hamas ca n't operate in turkey anymore . 
  turks really know absolutely nothing about hamas-israel conflict ... 
   except pkk usually attacked military targets . 
  does n't mean much when you kill 10 civilians to blow up one police car . 
  i do n't understand this target argument ... one look at the victims of kurdish terrorists will make you convince that there is zero attempt to minimize civilian casualties and i 'm not even counting the attacks that are directly targeted on civilians . 
   mlkp and minor more extreme groups are the ones who carried terroristic attacks . 
  your point is ? 
  did u/youthanasian mention pkk anywhere ? 
  to us it does ' t change much . 
  all of them revere the apo the founder of pkk and all those minor extremist groups were trained by pkk and split or still in contact with them . 
  you do n't see people trying to differentiate shit load of jihadist groups . 
   and if you did give kurds a democratic vote to have the autonomy they wanted for such a long time , you would n't be suffering as much . 
  why would we ? 
  turkey is a republic you ca n't just want something and expect it to happen without at least half of the elected mps approving it . 
  kurds have their own party in the parliament and kurdish politicians has been in the parliament for years just not as a party because of stupid high threshold however they were always there . 
  yet not once i heard a convincing argument on why autonomy is needed . 
  it 's always just threats like your example `` you would n't be suffering as much ''  i do n't support pkk and their ways because i 'm a democratic but turkey has just made things worse seeking war rather than peace . 
  ever heard of peace process ? 
  last 10 years we tried to make peace with terrorists and you know what happened ? 
  they used that time to stock up weapons , explosives and recruit and train militants for new insurgency . 
  now tell me who is seeking war ? 
  man germany really loves erdogan .

  textbook definition of terrorism . 
  greek cypriots were the aggressors and the purposeful instigators of this hate and violence . 
  greek majority island , yeah sure , it was also turkish majority for nearly a hundred years in big parts of the 18th and 19th century according to many european sources at the time . 
  the turkish population went down over time for various factors as quoted in the other comment . 
  but of course if we were to listen to geniuses like you turkish nationalists time travelled to pay i do n't know how many european historians to make it look in turks ' favor . 
  to want independence from britain is very different from aggressively demanding enosis which scared the whole turkish cypriot public deeply . 
  if we could go back in time we would tell both sides to stop the unrealistic nationalism , respect each other , and get independence from britain , and to live with respect side by side , turkish and greek cypriots in one country . 
  that was the only thing that was ever going to work . 
  oh ffs , i was away , how long is this conversation going to go . 
  please stop kidding yourself , the aggressive demand for enosis started by greeks opened up the very real possibility and the fear of ending up like several hundred thousand cretan turkish muslims , who were all either massacred or expelled . 
  so go ahead and blame turkish cypriots for not quite being okay with that and wanting a possibility to protect their communities in the security forces and uphold peace . 
  clearly very evil thing to do . 
  here :  in 1950 , michael mouskos , bishop makarios of kition ( larnaca ) , was elevated to archbishop makarios iii of cyprus . 
  in his inaugural speech , he vowed not to rest until union with `` mother greece '' had been achieved . 
  [ citation needed ] in athens , enosis was a common topic of conversation , and a cypriot native , colonel george grivas , was becoming known for his strong views on the subject . 
  in anticipation of an armed struggle to achieve enosis , grivas visited cyprus in july 1951 . 
  he discussed his ideas with makarios but was disappointed by the archbishop 's contrasting opinion as he proposed a political struggle rather than an armed revolution against the british . 
  from the beginning , and throughout their relationship , grivas resented having to share leadership with the archbishop . 
  makarios , concerned about grivas 's extremism from their very first meeting , preferred to continue diplomatic efforts , particularly efforts to get the united nations involved . 
  the feelings of uneasiness that arose between them never dissipated . 
  in the end , the two became enemies . 
  in the meantime , in august [ papagos government ] 1954 , greece 's un representative formally requested that self-determination for the people of cyprus be included on the agenda of the general assembly 's next session . 
  turkey rejected the idea of the union of cyprus and greece . 
  * turkish cypriot community opposed greek cypriot enosis movement , as under british rule the turkish cypriot minority status and identity were protected . 
  turkish cypriot identification with turkey had grown stronger in response to overt greek nationalism of greek cypriots * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cyprus_dispute and no , turkish cypriot security forces wanting to protect their communities were killed during the campaign that started in 1955 months before the pogrom instigated by menderes together with britain . 
  and you 're twisting what happened completely by judging the perpetrators , the factory workers as if they just woke up and felt like attacking greeks , rather than actually understanding that they were 100 % convinced that the same thing happened against turks in greece , so they did n't do anything that in their mind was anything more than a reaction to what greeks had done against them . 
  actually acknowledge this for the sake of objectivity if you 're going to comment on it at all . 
  and there was no turkish cypriot armed group a second before eoka was targetting turkish cypriots on the basis of being turkish . 
  your heroic freedom fighters , better known as terrorists . 
  they also killed hundreds of civilians . 
  what a proud legacy . 
  tmt was created in 1958 as a reaction , a counter-force against eoka . 
  nothing more . 
  and you want to talk about slaughters in cyprus , you have turkish cypriots beat a million times . 
  the facts speak for themselves , 130 + turkish cypriots slaughtered in two days , over 417 + in the years up to the intervention , ethnic cleansing of tens of thousands of turkish cypriots , hostage taking of over 700 civilians including women and children , threats , shootings , arson , mass graves of turkish cypriot civilians :  103 turkish cypriots villages were attacked . 
  [ 32 ] 700 turkish cypriot hostages , including women and children , were taken from the northern suburbs of nicosia ( into greek-cypriot houses , at omorphita north suburb , which in turn became refugees in their own country ) . 
  nikos sampson driving a digging vehicle himself , led a group of greek cypriot irregulars into the mixed suburb of omorphita after the greek cypriot neighbourhood of the suburb was attacked by the turkish cypriot militia . 
  [ 33 ] greek historian ronaldos katsaunis stated that he was an eye witness to the retaliation murder and communal burial of 32 turkish cypriot civilians in 1963 in famagusta . 
  [ 34 ] [ 35 ] contemporaneous newspapers also reported about the forceful exodus of the turkish cypriots from their homes . 
  according to the times journal issued in 1964 , threats , shootings and attempts of arson are committed against the turkish cypriots to force them out of their homes . 
  [ 36 ] the daily express wrote that `` 25,000 turks have already been forced to leave their homes '' . 
  [ 37 ] the guardian reported a massacre of turks at limassol on 16 february 1964 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cypriot_intercommunal_violence, 
  there were demands for enosis which was very hostile for the reasons i stated , there were killings deliberately targetting turkish cypriots who were in the security forces to purposely instigate hate , violence and chaos which the greek side for the most part does accept . 
  all that before the pogrom a thousand kilometers away by some workers who were told greeks had done the exact same in selanik .

  i did n't say between greeks and turks , it was against the security forces which included turkish cypriots .

  but the demand for enosis many years before is already extremely hostile to turks because it made it possible and created fear that turkish cypriots would end up like several hundred thousand cretan turkish muslims who were either massacred or expelled . 
  nah you 're just denying it because it goes against your argument , every side recognizes they were aiming to do exactly that . 
  again by an autocratic leader who was hung because of it . 
  everyone realizes the greeks were aiming to purposely create violent hatred between turkish cypriots and greeks . 
  armed fighting for enosis was actually happening already in 1953 , several years before the pogrom created by menderes . 
  no they did n't , there was zero of that occuring within a thousand kilometers of cyprus . 
  the first clashes were in 1955 by greeks who purposely instigated provocations with the purpose of creating hatred and chaos . 
  everyone including greeks realize this . 
  greeks purposely started the chaos , hate , violence by killing turkish cypriots in much higher numbers , double as many as was done in return to them purely as a product of the situation they purposely started . 
  they took 700 turkish cypriot women and children hostage . 
  they ethnically cleansed tens of thousands of turkish cypriots . 
  after two decades of all this occuring , greek fascists guilty of this disgusting stuff waged a military coup to force the turkish cypriots they had already been slaughtering for years to enosis . 
  that 's correct . 
  you ca n't even read the page you linked yourself , very impressive honestly . 
  no you killed over 417 + turkish cypriots . 
  and you committed mass ethnic cleansing against tens of thousands of turkish cypriots . 
  and greek cypriots did n't have a hair on their head touched before enosis demanding eoka were killing turkish cypriot policemen in order to purposely spread hate and chaos . 
  and when they did it was at a rate not anywhere near half of the slaughters of turkish cypriots . 
  and mhp have as much to do with neo nazism as israel does . 
  you know nothing whatsoever about them so do n't talk . 
  they talk about normal turkish nationalist stuff , against pkk , they get a ton of votes from people who think akp and chp are too soft on pkk , and want more connections with other turkic countries . 
  that 's 90 % of the reason they get any votes . 
  their leader spoke hard against discrimination against alevis , and calls kurds his brothers and pkk does n't represent them at all ( which is correct but that 's irrelevant here ) . 
  they have never advocated fascism at any point in time , they have respected democracy for 50 years with zero exceptions . 
  everyone knows how golden dawn praises nazi germany . 
  it also praised stalin as a great personality like hitler , so the fanboys of the most disgusting butchers of tens of millions get 9,4 % votes in greece . 
  read it out loud . 
  nine point four percent . 
  500k + votes . 
  again , it 's entirely their fault a reaction all of this happened . 
  what are you actually talking about ? 
  130 turkish cypriots were killed in two days , and on top of that in the years after several times that of additional turkish cypriots were killed . 
  and that turkish cypriot group that was n't fascist unlike your greek enonis fascist coup that triggered the intervention , and neo-nazi golden dawn who got 9,4 % votes ( 500.000 + votes ) 2014 in greece , was non existant before several years after eoka ( heavily supported by greece ) were killing turkish cypriot policemen intentionally to provoke chaos and violence where turkish cypriots would have no chance as the minority but to accept their demand for enosis by fascists . 
  you want to talk about ethnic cleansing ? 
  here you go . 
   103 turkish cypriots villages were attacked . 
  [ 32 ] 700 turkish cypriot hostages , including women and children , were taken from the northern suburbs of nicosia ( into greek-cypriot houses , at omorphita north suburb , which in turn became refugees in their own country ) . 
  nikos sampson driving a digging vehicle himself , led a group of greek cypriot irregulars into the mixed suburb of omorphita after the greek cypriot neighbourhood of the suburb was attacked by the turkish cypriot militia . 
  [ 33 ] greek historian ronaldos katsaunis stated that he was an eye witness to the retaliation murder and communal burial of 32 turkish cypriot civilians in 1963 in famagusta . 
  [ 34 ] [ 35 ] contemporaneous newspapers also reported about the forceful exodus of the turkish cypriots from their homes . 
  according to the times journal issued in 1964 , threats , shootings and attempts of arson are committed against the turkish cypriots to force them out of their homes . 
  [ 36 ] the daily express wrote that `` 25,000 turks have already been forced to leave their homes '' . 
  [ 37 ] the guardian reported a massacre of turks at limassol on 16 february 1964 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cypriot_intercommunal_violence as i said , greeks are 100 % responsible for triggering this intervention . 
  it 's entirely their fault a reaction happened . 
  well obviously after being called out on saying something so illogical . 
  they are rebuttals of your stupid claims and arguments about it being ethnic cleansing to intervene against repeated massacres of turkish cypriots . 
  mhp have nothing to do with fascism or neo nazism . 
  i do n't agree with them but they have respected democratic processes without exception for 50 years and have never advocated anything resembling fascism and autocratic militaristic states , they just talk about nationalist issues , other turkic countries , go to elections and that 's it . 
  okay and what about the other 270 mosques ? 
  you are actually silly enough to think some people who slaughtered over a hundred turkish cypriots would be above destroying holy buildings for turkish cypriots ? 
  do n't tell me you believe something like this . 
  if you intervene to prevent a over a decade long trend of massacres and it escalating into a greek fascist coup , and you do n't intervene a second before that coup , then it 's something that you are 100 % in the right to do with the goal of protecting turkish cypriots , you can call it whatever idiotic thing you want to , everyone with a slight sense of logic knows the purpose . 
  we were desperate to intervene all the way from the 60s to protect them from your disgusting massacres , we did n't wait we were forced to .

  large cities are generally more efficient in other respects too , like public transport and health services . 
  of course metropolises like istanbul , moscow , london , mexico city etc. . . are a bit of an overkill , especially for rich societies which can afford to make larger investments for the same return . 
  and frankly i do n't want istanbul to get any bigger . 
  it has been growing at an average of 200,000 people a year and the infrastructure is stretched to the limit . 
  but i also feel that in a global sense we do n't have too many people . 
  overpopulation is n't a real issue . 
  the earth can support about 40 billion people with our current tech , and it looks like we will top out at about 11 billion . 
  having more people means more genetic diversity which means we wont be easily wiped out by one disease or another . 
  i mea n't individually . 
  greater tokyo and new york are bigger than 20 mil though . 
  in the end both sides look brainwashed by their respective media to each other , which to be honest , is n't too far from the truth . 
  after all there are other more subtle carrots and sticks that can be wielded by power centers than jail terms . 
  i wish more people could just admit that they do n't actually know whats going on . 
   but even if the coupt was organized by gulen/his supporters , there really is n't any doubt about this . 
   is n't erdogan exploiting this situation and arresting all sorts of people that do n't agree with him , not just the gulen supporters ? 
  yes . 
  i can confirm that people that have nothing to do with gulen have been arrested . 
  to be fair , all of the ones i have identified were subsequently also released . 
  again to be fair , no one fired in the aftermath has been returned to their jobs , and certainly many of the fired people had nothing to do with g\u00fclen . 
  the akp has never been weaker . 
  they look incompetent to the public . 
  but western media is actually helping the akp with their narrative . 
  if it it 's akp vs the rest of the world , most turks will chose the akp . 
  i guess it depends on your arbitrary definition . 
  interesting that europe has been expanding eastwards throughout history . 
  there really is n't a definition of the word continent that would separate europe from asia , without creating any other continents or making a special case out of europe . 
  kazakhstan has land in europe , wut ? 
  geography fail . 
  denmark , norway and sweden all have less population than the city i live in . 
  since the languages you speak are pretty much mutually intelligible , and there are n't significant religious differences between you it baffles me why you are n't the same country . 
  if i were dictator of the world , i 'd put you all together in the state of borkistan . 
  it 's either both or neither . 
  neo nazis can be terrorists too , it 's not exclusive to muslims . 
  if it 's a politically motivated rampage then it 's terrorism . 
  emperor was better , padishah is the more accurate local term . 
  all the members of the royal family were called sultans , including the women . 
  trump is not going to win . 
  exactly . 
  this guy has been in our consciousness for ever . 
  it 's not our fault that you do n't follow turkish politics very closely . 
   '' a wet man does not fear rain '' ( i 'm not sure if it translates well to turkish though ) i think that can translate to any language . 
  it would be '' \u0131slak adam ya\u011fmurdan korkmaz '' in turkish and makes perfect sense . 
   probably illegal although some eu support on this issue would be welcomed . 
  however our pm and fm are idiots so . . 
  i honestly do n't blame the greeks for the mess they are in . 
  europe has been too focused with the money owed . 
  but what should have happened is that the people who got you in to the eurozone and hid stuff should have gone to jail , as well as tax fraud investigations . 
  the debt was something the german tax payer could essentially laugh off . 
  yes . 
  it is important not to overreact to rare events . 
  the problem is that you have too many muslims . 
  if you only have a few muslims they are great . 
  did you know the vatican owns a whole city block in istanbul near gezi park ? 
  it must be worth billions . 
  i do n't understand catholics at all , this is not just a religion , it 's a business . 
  i 'm sure there are some economic measures turkey can use . 
  especially given greece ' situation this might be bad . 
  although greece can use this as a bargaining chip with the eu . 
  keep them in greece in exchange for eu funds . 
  please do not confuse being against the coup as being for erdo\u011fan . 
  also they have nuclear weapons . 
  their own nuclear weapons . 
  yeah , i 've hear it referred to as the turkish slavery from bulgarian friends ( i have quite a few that i met in germany , we can still get along despite the indoctrination ) . 
  i think most bulgarians also do n't know that the devshirme system of harvesting christian boys for the army ended in 1648 . 
  so slavery seems like a bit of an overstatement . 
  i think it has to be presented as really bad to justify the expulsions when bulgaria gained it 's independence . 
  they are probably old though . 
  this needs to be understood more . 
  nah , nostalgia has been around for ever . 
  the greeks wrote about it . 
  it has more to do with the innocence of a child than any modern contrivance . 
   probably met ataturk maybe . 
  she was 12 when he died . 
  i read some time back if you buy 300k worth of property in spain you can get citizenship . 
  i expect many rich secular people from turkey will start doing that . 
  yeah . 
  if the chp and mhp had run separate candidates i do n't think we would have erdo\u011fan as president right now . 
  it is n't . 
  the government is ok with it . 
  they even added a day of free public transport and one mp asked akp voters to show their support as well . 
  unless it 's a devious trap where they are willing to kill their own voters too potentially , i think they will do their best to keep isis away . 
  this is a democracy rally not a coup rally . 
  it 's important that secularist show their numbers though . 
  should n't it be priced in, 
  i feel your pain . 
  but please do n't go . 
  if you are in istanbul or close by ; come to the chp meeting on sunday 18.00 in taksim . 
  bring an ataturk flag . 
  remember : mustafa kemal atat\u00dcrk 's address to turkish youth turkish youth , your first duty is to preserve and to defend turkish independence and the turkish republic forever.this is the very foundation of your existence and your future . 
  this foundation is your most precious treasure . 
  in the future , too , there may be malevolent people at home and abroad , who will wish to deprive you of this treasure . 
  if some day you are compelled to defend your independence and your republic , you must not hesitate to weigh the possibilities and circumstances of the situation before doing your duty.these possibilities and circumstances may turn out to be extremely unfavourable . 
  the enemies conspiring against your independence and your republic may have behind them a victory unprecedented in the annals of the world . 
  it may be that , by violence and trickery , all the fortresses of your beloved fatherland may be captured , all its shipyards occupied , all its armies dispersed and every corner of the country invaded . 
  and sadder and graver than all these circumstances , those who hold power within the country may be in error , misguided and may even be traitors . 
  furthermore , they may identify personal interests with the political designs of the invaders . 
  the country may be impoverished , ruined and exhausted . 
  youth of turkey 's future , even in such circumstances it is your duty to save turkish independence and the republic !, 
  you will find the strength you need in your noble blood, 
  unless the ~ ~ king ~ ~ ** queen ** really wants a divorce .

  about 20 + million people living behind/close of hunger threshold in turkey . 
  turkey is going to be serious economic problem of europe . 
  when you think that 80 million + 10 million syrian population here , yeah it will be a huge economical problem . 
  this will also effect turkey 's economics because eu requires serious developments from participants before the joining . 
  ( especially from turkey . ), 
  can we do it ? 
  i do n't think that we can do it next 100 years . 
  if turkey joins eu , there will be a serious migration to european countries from turkey because of unemployment in the country . 
  many people who supports to joining eu idea think that there will be a good job opportunity for them in europe and they will live somewhere like paradise . 
  i guess almost 15 million people ( actually more than that ) will try to emigrate to europe , if turkey ever join to eu . 
  most of these people will be uneducated and non-skilled workers . 
  believe me most of them wo n't even know english but they will go abroad ... well , we faced with syrian refugee problem in recent years . 
  we want them to turn back their countries as soon as possible after the war ends . 
  it is because arab culture is very different with ours and we complain that they are uneducated and non-skilled . . 
  while we are thinking like that it will be double standard if we want turkey to join europe . 
  security is another serious issue ... turkey 's terror problem will never end ( not mentioning about the religious one ) . 
  the terror causing turkey to spend serious amount of cash . 
  that is also important barrier against development of turkey . 
  if i was a eu citizen , i would n't want a country in the union which is fighting against terrorism for years . 
  because terror can also effect my country and other union countries with freedom of movement , politics , etc. 
  terrorists can easily come in and go out from south eastern border of turkey . 
  why except turkey ? 
  i am also against turkey 's joining to eu . 
  however i would like to know reason of that though ... 
  it is about religion or politics or turkish people or cultural ? 
  you can not spell * turkey * without * turkey * . 
  now i have enlightened about an energy issue about the past . 
  you know i was living in thrace , very next to bulgarian border . 
  we were importing energy from bulgaria to thrace in about ... may be 20 years ago ... not sure ... 
  i have heard it 's stopped after some time bulgaria joined eu . 
  i have thought trade politics of bulgaria has changed after they joined union . 
  it seems the situation was quite different . 
   there was no referendum in my county if we want nato/eu i understand your point in this word well . 
  i do n't know about nato but almost 70 percent of turkey does n't also want to join eu . 
  however our politicians do n't give a fuck about that and go on to run after join eu . 
  however i do n't understand why do you feel you are invaded though . 
  joining eu effected your economy or culture ? 
  where is your country ? 
  eu or europe ? 
  if cyprus was n't an eu member , i could agree . 
  berlin has one ... 
  but can not remember its name . 
  i am sure one of german friends can though . 
  oh yeah , they do n't . 
  i just asked a friend . 
  hehe . 
  i have heard italians are using horse dick for swear/insult too . 
  til : according to islam , if a muslim woman marry someone outside of her religion , she is no longer muslim . 
  their whole relation is going to be fornication . 
  i do n't know the reason of that . 
  since muslim men allowed to marry outside their religion . 
  when someone tell me about belarus i just recall my neighbour and his mysterious belarusian love . 
  he was 70 years old retired colonel . 
  retired colonels are famous in turkey with being idle and seeking for adventures . 
  he has met a belarusian girl on internet . 
  he was keep knocking my door while he was talking her on msn messenger since he did n't know english . 
  ( he knew german instead ) so i was talking to girl instead of him . 
  he was keep nudging me and say `` what 's she saying ?!, 
  what 's she saying ?! '' . 
  one day he sent a gold necklace to girl and we did n't hear from girl again . 
  he has even bought tickets for go to minsk . 
  : / things we do for love ... :d, 
  i just understand the last sentence from the whole story . 
  at yarra\u011f\u0131 = horse dick ( aka at kafas\u0131 = horse head ), 
  well , we could n't win world cup but this is celebration after turkey got 3rd position in 2002 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zit3jv7d0, 
  * highfive *, 
  ah , thank you for the info . 
  domzale and koper are nice locations . 
  where are you from , if you do n't mind ? 
  there is no white nationalism . 
  there is not a white as a nation . 
  there is only white racism . 
  white nationalism idea has been came from those who could n't identify themselves with a nation . 
  like americans and australians . 
  i do n't agree the idea though since it does n't make any sense to me . 
  i do n't think refugees are americans concern . 
  because europeans are facing the refugee problem at the moment . 
  this is not a common concern of americans and europeans . 
  otherwise i would agree about that . 
  americans are already accepting a hundred of thousands of asians , arabs , africans their country every year legally . 
  why are you concerning about europe ?!, 
  :d i believe americans should worry about themselves first . 
  [ hrant dink ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assassination_of_hrant_dink ), 
  i go italy very often because of business . 
  we import leathers and export leather products there and i visit there for multiple fairs . 
  i was sad because there is not archaeology in cities where i have interested . 
  especially i love messina , when i go there i feel like i am in turkey . 
  the new is here : https://onedio.com/haber/ciktigina-pisman-ettik-2700-yillik-stel-plastik-firca-ile-araba-yikar-gibi-temizlendi-769577 shortly they damage the artifact with the crane and then they cleared the artifact with plastic broom . 
  i will try find other tragicomic incidents . 
  i know there are many examples of that . 
  yeah i have heard of it about 2-3 days ago i think . 
  the full version of mosaic art ( that you have shown in the picture ) is very nice . 
  thank you very much . 
  thank you very much . 
  thank you very much for the list . 
  was quite informative . 
  we generally find historical artifacts after we crush them hard with cranes in turkey . 
  haha . 
  thank you very much . 
  to be honest i am very confused with universities in uk .

  like turkey , they are too looking for their interests and that is fighting isis while gaining land as much as they can from syria , iraq and possibly turkey . 
  you can call turkish people what you want but you are in no position to say anything, 
  no way the opposition will allow it, 
  afterwards they would ban spaghetti lol . 
  and people would eat that shit up, 
  please do . 
  but you ca n't . 
  eu do n't have the balls to upset turkey whatsoever . 
  do n't worry . 
  i also agree with the most of the greek argumants but i also recognize that world is not perfect and especially international politics is full of compromises . 
  sometimes i fucking hate this subreddit because of the prejudice on turkish users . 
  always jumping to conclusions . 
  amount of hatred/ignorance is really sad, 
   i think they are lightyears away from fulfilling all the requirements and rules of the eu , food safety , production . . of stuff and so on . 
  do you know how many of your shit are made in turkey or by turkish companies ? 
  man ... 
  the amount of ignorant claims here are crazy . 
  almost everyone here are just throwing facts out of their asses, 
  how old are you ? 
   if you go across to the other side it 's like walking back in time 40 years . 
  thanks to you guys ... 
  did you ever think maybe just maybe some of us are from cyprus ? 
  you can continue to believe that and obviously things are different for the cypriot leaders since they are still having these talks . 
  invader does n't have to do shit . 
  they can stay in this position for ever . 
  however it is better for cypriots to comprise as this is the only way they can go back to their homes . 
  world is not black and white as you seem to think so, 
  you have to make compromises . 
  invasion is legitimized as it is since there is another country on the north side of the island . 
  it does n't matter if you do n't recognize it . 
  for the better future of the island , you can not pretend as if there are no people living in the north side . 
  without any compromises there wo n't be any agreement . 
  according to some people who are involved in this progress , there are talks going on regarding the things you mentioned . 
  for military obviously they will have to retreat but settler issue is a little bit complicated . 
  i heard that there is a plan that will involve giving citizenship to the `` skilled '' settlers as well as those who are 2nd or 3rd gen settlers . 
  actually it is expected that , if everything goes well , there will be an agreement in the next 3 years, 
  turkey is not also a whore, 
  i think balkan is much more related to turkey and they are to western europe . 
  hell i think mediterranean countries have quite in common . 
  other than the religion , you would be really suprised how common stuff we share, 
  what do you think ethnicity of the turkish people ? 
  as much as some people in europe like us to have a civil war , it wo n't happen . 
  stop the fucking circlejerk, 
  damn ... 
  lol what, 
  usa . 
  but actually its no one . 
  usa is only our `` ally '' due to similar interests . 
  trump is the american version of erdogan . 
  full of shit , totally incompetent and ignorant . 
  he is a populist leader who does n't know how the world works . 
  i find all the turks who are against erdo yet support trump as dumb asses and hypocrites as well btw . 
  i hate everything erdogan stands for and trump stands for . 
  i am a big supporter of globalization and these people are just going to fuck up the international politics if they get their way . 
  yeah hillary supports the kurds but so does trump . 
  trump is not a predictable person and he is as warmonger as hillary . 
  i am not a blinded nationalist that will support trump just because i want us to suffer . 
  because i know that if us suffers , the whole world will feel its effect . 
  i am a citizen of this world and i stand by my values . 
  i will not support a bigot , racist , ignorant no matter what . 
  yes hillary was corrupt but still better than trump . 
  i hate this year ... 
  actually akp supporters use kemalist as an insult these days, 
  damn , greek media is really determined to create a drama out of thin air . 
  it 's pathetic ... 
  if anything , these speeches are widening the gap between islamist turks and secularists, 
  do n't take it too seriously . 
  he is just showing off for his voter base as usual . 
  this does n't even make the headlines in turkey, 
  this is what i always try to teach people . 
  people in turkey vary so much in terms of appearance , culture or even religion that it is very hard to simplify a typical turkish person . 
  after 4 years of visiting this subreddit , i too have my pressure point . 
  especially you racists greeks have been pushing everything too far . 
  i am sick of getting called a murderer every time there is an international issue . 
  enough is enough, 
  i am not a dumbass that does an average country comparison online to prove my country is best . 
  some overall statistic on my country does not effect me or my surrounding at all although i would have preferred to be better . 
  keep your nationalist ideal as i am sure it will make you successful in your life / s. 
  these people are so brainwashed on their hatred against turks it 's pathetic . 
  i like how they diverted what happened to cyprus to izmir and then to armenian genocide . 
  always the same topics, 
  nice diversion . 
  check out massacres on turkish people in the balkan if you are also looking into it . 
  you and your country have a pahetic history and will be pathetic for a foreseeable future . 
  stop living in a fantasy, 
  why the fuck would turks burn down their own city they just captured ? 
  funny how only christians are the only ones effected . 
  good for propaganda i guess after the failure in anatolia, 
  yeah i am not gon na trust all those countries who have been fighting with turks for decades too . 
  victor writes history right ? 
  not to mention , jewish locals were much more involved than some soldiers sailing by near the city, 
  there are accounts of jewish locals in izmir that tells us otherwise . 
  shame your ancestors werent included into those people, 
  keep telling yourself that, 
  did i say anything about recognition ? 
  it makes sense northern cyprus is leaning towards turkey because they are the only ones that support the local population, 
  in what other country there was literally a civil war going on and then one side decided to do a coup to join a neighboring country without asking the minority . 
  you can rely on international laws all you want but as long as turkish cypriots feels threatened ( and they do ) , they will always try to protect themselves . 
  edit : you guys can downvote me all you want but these issues are always two-sided . 
  just because you do n't like how other side thinks does n't mean you can just ignore it,

  turkey would supply the needed military power for extension of the second pillar , nothing much, 
  whatever ... greece was a bad idea , so was spain and portugal, 
  and there was no plan b, 
  i guess privatization do not favour the masses , so the left and center-left parties ( syriza included ) would oppose such giant private company operating in ports . 
  just ca n't believe how many times the government has changed its discourse on israel, 
  the head of turkish diyanet functions as a `` pawn '' who gives speeches in order to justify head of government 's argument . 
  before a decade , the head of turkish diyanet used to have a secular rhetoric . 
  their position changes according to the ruling party 's ideology , thats all , not a big deal . 
  antibiotic madness led to mad bacterias , indeed . 
  yannis varoufakis was talking about that last week . 
  i 'm sure chinese occupation will create a giant greek opposition . 
  the govt . 
  wont be able to handle it, 
  as a turk , i want this dispute to be vanished forever , and be able to drink with my cypriot friends, 
  most of the time , what tr and gre jets do is `` dogfight '' , nothing serious happening for decades, 
  since a turkish jet was downed by syrian forces two years ago , turkish military announced the new rules ( according to int . 
  law ) which was declaring at least 10 kilometers cross-border as `` no-fly zone '' . 
  the russian jet was shot because tr forces were warning the russian pilot since he violated the no-fly zone and was about to enter tr border as we see in this map : http://img.haberler.com/haber/197/dusurulen-ucakla-ilgili-tsk-dan-aciklama-5-7904197_9977_m.jpg and it was downed when it was passing through that tiny bulge tr land , 
  when i consider that still there are many serbian politicians and soldiers who should be trialed for violating human rights during bosnian civil war , i ca n't believe this negotiations are happening . 
  shut up and push the button for f sake, 
  i joined reddit 3 days ago , thats why, 
  because putin has a photo doing taekwondo ? 
  for three days i 'm trying to attract some attention to this surveillance issue , and at last someone could do some progress, 
  and the true tragedy is , this heading was served in a website called `` hotnews '', 
  having that pm among those macho mps is a rare coincidence . 
  no words to describe 0:07, 
  if we apply a `` democracy and human rights '' test to turkey , the result is gon na be a failure . 
  and yes , erdogan and his crew harmed the society severely , and will do so . 
  but we also should not forget the fact that turkey is under stress for 31 years , this means every government has ever formed faced with the hard conditions of politics under terror threats . 
  is hdp a democratic/civic alternative ? 
  first of all , hdp is a pro-kurdish party which has close ties with pkk , and everyone knows this . 
  so , it is the alternative for some kurdish people in south-eastern region , other than jdp . 
  is this party democratic ? 
  well , i can assure you that if you compare any other political party with jdp , all seem democratic anyway . 
  this is fucked up . 
  by the way , please search more on pkk issue , because the issue is so big to cover in just one reply , and i need to practice for my presentation today . 
  one fact : most majority of heroine passes through turkey in its way towards europe , and pkk has the control of drug smuggling for the last 20 years , and they do it with weapons they acquire from god knows where . 
  you can check interpol and europol datas . 
  i was talking in the context of turkey , of course you are right , the numbers are horrifying in syria & iraq, 
  as a turkish citizen , i want to express my thoughts about contemporary issues we have so far . 
  first of all , i 'm voting against erdogan since i 'm able to vote ( since over 18 years old ) . 
  the last election result was a big shock for me , and almost lost my power to resist against erdogan . 
  i want turkey to join eu , but not in these conditions . 
  `` rule of law '' is lost , cencorship is high , the opposition is being suppressed , our country is under serious terror threats , and we are facing with all kinds of terrorist attacks more than 30 years . 
  i welcome syrian refugees , because i understand their tragedy . 
  they are escaping to turkey and europe , because they were raped , their towns no longer exist , they were threatened to leave their country , and they need help . 
  i am ready to share as much as i can . 
  right now , a civil war is happening in south-eastern turkey , and those little towns are looking just like the syrian towns day-by-day . 
  i 'm terrified by the thought that , my country will be lost because of this contagious-dark-vicious terror wave . 
  and please show some respect to `` others '' and `` people in great danger '' ( especially some of you ) . 
  i am no longer able to think about how to resist erdogan , just thinking about how much can all these go worse . 
  the dispute between tr govt . 
  and pkk ( kurdish-nationalist terror org . ), 
  resulted as 7946 tr soldier deaths , 4828 civillian deaths , and 41902 terrrorist deaths , until now . 
  the bombings of isis resulted as over 150 deaths so far . 
  comparing numbers would be an unmoral thing to do , since all lives are precious . 
  but one also should not treat the two issues as identical conflicts . 
  tr is fighting against pkk for 31 years in a different geography and for different causations ( seperatist actions etc. 
  ) , whereas isis is radical-islamist terror organization against all regional powers in middle east . 
  in turkey , building enourmous-sized mosques became justice and development party 's big political fantasy . 
  also they prefer to build these on strategic places which used to be the most prefered socializing centers for citizens . 
  for example , they are building a mosque on top of a hill called '' \u00c7aml\u0131ca '' where people used to drink rak\u0131 ( turkish national drink ) and enjoy the great view of bosphorus . 
  also they are planning to build another in kad\u0131k\u00f6y right near the docks , planning to block the view again . 
  well , this was the first time that eu commission delayed a progress report on a candidate state . 
  also , the last summit with turkey shows how eu is ready to play it dirty . 
  it has been told that eu will put 500 million by itself , and the remaining 2.5 billion will be collected by member states in voluntary basis . 
  even they give tr 3 billion liras , it is not the permanent solution . 
  holding 3 + million refugees is a challenging task . 
  it appears to me that , just like in the movies , when a guy gets killed , people call some dark men to get rid of the body , this is how it goes . 
  by the way , i saw the picture putin have the black box from the downed russian jet on his table . 
  turkish govt . 
  released the radar route , and us approved , so what putin will do with it ? 
  play some ? 
  wow thanks , i 'll read them . 
  the thing is some of my pro-turkish friends always love jobbik for its turanism , so i thought russians should n't be engaging with them, 
  yeah sounds like a fungus lobbyist trying to bubble up some fungus conspiracy theory, 
  jobbik , the right-wing party from hungary ? 
  just another no-win scenario, 
  in the economic sense , dealing with greece is harder than the refugees . 
  why so serious ? 
  and you think you know everything , do n't you ? 
  go and play with your modern welfare state plz, 
  so the civillians are just unnecessary details ... 
  education is a fundamental right . 
  in south-eastern region of turkey , the government is supplying elementary education for syrian children . 
  public schools are organized accordingly . 
  even , they have arabic language classes . 
  by the way , there are 3 million syrian refugees in turkey . 
  i wonder which european country is being obliged to take more refugees than its population . 
  or , do you mean every non-christian or ethnically non-european people by saying `` foreigners '' ? 
  bcz that would be racist . 
  if you stop concerning for the other parts of the world , the problems are going to hit you . 
  turkey has 3 million syrian refugees , should she get rid of them ? 
  should she send everyone untill she have only native turks ? 
  as a turkish citizen , i dont support erdogan , and know that the journalists who wrote about secret weapon delivery from turkish intelligence department to syria ( location unknown ) are jailed . 
  but , i think that iraqi pm is not a reliable source , since iraqi govt . 
  has always been sounded like pro-russia or pro-us , its easy to blame turkey for anything , as long as they are backed up by the big powers, 
  i think blaming eu for every problem is the way how right-wing parties gain support , and these time periods will be occasional . 
  european citizens have the ability to make the right choice , eventually . 
  well put,

  there cant be a byzantine empire without turkey and greece , 
  yea with the minorities making 0.000001 % of the population . 
  yea with the minorities making 0.000001 % of the population . 
  will eu fell apart before we ever get in ? 
  will eu fell apart before we ever get in ? 
  typical for europeans . 
  they dont want anyone near turks . 
  its not probably . 
  turkic ( central asian ) genes are like 1 % of the whole gene pool of turkish people . 
  we are descendants of the indigenous people of anatolia , caucasus , balkans and middle east . 
  kurds were always a closed society so there is not much gene fusion between us . 
   casual racism from my experience is pretty big in turkey no its not . 
  turkey did not - let me repeat - did not bully cyprus . 
  it was greek cypriots who first started to kill their turkish cypriot brothers . 
  turkey waited for years and years but massacres , murders didnt stop . 
  some time later turkish cypriots formed militias to protect theirselves as a result of greek cypriot aggression . 
  all this time turkish cypriot community was bleeding due to emigrating outside to save their lives and some dieing because of greeks . 
  you should check those : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cypriot_intercommunal_violence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bloody_christmas_ ( 1963 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eoka_b https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akritas_plan but i know what you will say you will typically blatantly like a true westerner deny what i have written and wont even click those sources . 
  in the end turkey will be evil and greeks will be innocent . 
  because how can evil barbarian turks be victim ? 
  how typical for you ... 
  yep . 
  you know nothing . 
  hehe . 
  not really . 
  i am fine with them . 
  the problem is they really are uncivilised and dont pay anything to the government while using its resources . 
  you are correct but there is nothing can be done . 
  newer generations suffer older generation 's deeds whether be good or bad . 
  there are much worser things happening all around the world . 
  i hope the best for them and i believe `` no '' is the best answer for them . 
  hope they show the middle finger to merkel . 
  yaaaaaaaay :d unfortunately land does not directly contributes economy . 
  southeastern part for example eats far more than they give . 
  turkey 's intervention was not somewhat justified it was justified . 
  and it was not because of the cyrus ' constitution because turkish cypriots were actually being murdered by their greek neighbours . 
   it claims the whole island no it doesnt . 
  it claims 91 % of the island . 
  excluding 2 uk bases at the southernmost tip and another at the south of nicosia . 
  and what were they all happy before invasion ? 
  turkish cypriots were being butchered by eoka-b and those people were trying to run away from the island . 
  to britain , austria . 
  when turkey intervened turks at the south left their everything and ran to the north , greeks did the same but turkish community of the island was already bleeding for decades prior to intervention . 
  stop looking only at the one side . 
  are we ? 
  we are bigger than most ( if not all ? 
  ukraine ? ), 
  european countries . 
  thanks . 
  here take this upvote . 
  thanks mate . 
  i like you russians . 
  your culture is a mix of west and east too like us . 
  we should find a club of outcasts . 
  why do we even pursue eu ? 
  they will never accept nor like us . 
  russia is a strong self-sustained power , no way stupid sanctions can make it collapse . 
  have an upvote , 
  lol if what happened to them would happen to us everyone here would be smiling , 
  what happened in cyprus ? 
  well turk land has some pretty diverse climate where some part never sees snow and the other part lives in snow for 8 months :d, 
  yea this is next . 
  i have given up hope on / r/worldnews, 
  i will ask an irrelevant question . 
  does tsipras mean that ellipse fish ? 
  it is . 
  so basically erdogan is the supreme commander of all armies in turkey . 
  however in the past president commanded general ( highest after president in terms of military ) to attack iraq ( basically being a tool of usa at that time ) general refused and said that the army only exists to defend turkey and not to invade another country so he resigned , president didnt command again to the new general which replaced him . 
  anyway such attack wont happen . 
  erdogan is on good terms with barzani . 
  ok do it . 
  eastern turkey is what screws us anyway . 
  just take marmara , aegean and meditarrenean parts of turkey . 
  yea yea i know . 
  if i was eu i probably wouldnt take turkey either . 
  we could have been much better but oh damn those islamists !, 
  now with all those syrian migrants we have even much worser kind of islamists compared to the worst we already had !, 
  oh if only i could be poseidon and seperate turkey from middle east . 
  es ist 500 years of peace and prosperity , 
  small ? 
  not big enough ? 
  absorb turkey !, 
  we have more land than germany and a bit less population !, 
  absorb turkey now !, 
  lmao !, 
  money can be used to create jobs !, 
  tourists ? 
  well done m8, 
  oh please i can give more examples . 
  saudi arabia . 
  we can not disrespect their king or shah or whatever its called because it their culture and yes they had that for faar too long . 
  how can they generate revenue ? 
  how come ? 
  dictatorship is only good if the dictator is a good guy . 
  how dare you ??!, 
  kill him !!!, 
  kill him with fireeeeeee !!!!, 
  the way of ruling can not be one 's culture . 
  then we shouldnt kim jong because its `` n. korea 's culture '', 
  money spent on them could be spent to feed the poor .

  man my cousin on my fathers side has blond hair and blue eyes and my cousin on my moms side has the complexion of an arab , trust me there is so much variation its crazy . 
  italians and greeks both disagreed on how to divide western anatolia , the rest of the allies backed greece . 
  italy saw this as a losing battle and actually decided to help mustafa kemal , training his army and providing him with weapons . 
  it would n't have felt right if the italians did n't switch sides , 
  they know the dangers , the only reason they are taking such a risky trip is because the alternative is worse . 
  turkey 's control over the bosphorus is dictated by the montreux convention . 
  the convention gives turkey some leeway over its allowance of military vessels , but any civilian or merchant ships are not allowed to be blocked unless turkey is at war with the nation the ships are originating from . 
  meaning if turkey applied sanctions on russia it still would n't legally be allowed to block any non-military vessels passing through the straights , if it did then it would be considered an act of war and nato has no obligation to help . 
  whats nice about north america is that there is civic nationalism , meaning that if you believe in canadian or american ideals you are considered a canadian or american . 
  a chinese immigrant can be an american nationalist , and thats why there is no negative - but in fact positive - connotation behind being a patriot or nationalist in north america . 
  europe is ruled by ethnic nationalism , an arab will never really be considered to be a german by the vast majority of germans . 
  it is much , much easier to integrate in canada or america than it is in europe due to this difference in mentality . 
  country | neutral percentage -- | -- switzerland | 100 %, 
  i mean theres also a chance thats your turkish colleagues were n't muslim . 
  every wedding i have gone to has been ` christian ' even if the ones getting married are not , its a part of the culture . 
  sanctions have literary nothing to do with blocking the bosphorus . 
  turkey safer then belgium ? 
  the only reason belgium would n't be safe would be because of turkish immigrants . 
  http://www.vg.no/protokoll/bilder/large/ace25194966e67d727eb8a9074b822cf.jpg first image i get when i googled `` norwegian road '' http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/denmark-odense-danish_national_road_9.jpg first image i get when i googled `` danish road '' . 
  yup , canada is experiencing the same problems , driving in any city is godawful , its like driving on seal 's ( the singer ) cheeks . 
  its better than the alternative disinterest in infrastructure , then you get a bunch of shoddy bridges and tunnels like the us . 
  you mean muslim serbs ? 
  they will be converted back to their forgotten roots and be happy again . 
  edit : take a joke you chernobyl , borscht eating , cabbage head motherfuckers . 
  we can have this argument over and over again but the people living in modern day turkey are the same people that were living their 5000 years ; they just have a new language . 
  this is turkish politics , everything is relative . 
  compared to the military dictators and adnan menderes he could have been much worse . 
  he tried to solve turkeys foreign policy issues , established a much better economy , was far more secular than earlier elected prime ministers , all in all incomparable to erdogan . 
  ozil ? 
  what did he do ? 
  the economy got better and he was mostly secular , what more do you want . 
  edit : ozal my bad, 
  it 's like saying danes and swedes are the same . 
  they are related , and their languages are similar but they are not the same . 
  looks like i 'll need to renew my turkish and georgian passports . 
  hes talking about world war 1 and the independence war that followed . 
  regardless the consensus is that crimean 's wanted to be a part of a russia , and after a year it still seems to be the case . 
  there was a referendum , and even with corruption most experts agreeded that the majority of crimea would be in favour of joining with russia . 
  k so what russia did in crimea is a ok then ? 
  few turks have joined from turkey as well , it 's relative again , but most people joining isis out of turkey are from the southeast and are usually arabic or kurdish . 
  not to say no turks have joined , it 's just a smaller number then you would expect . 
  we also a state appointed relgious system though which keeps salafism at bay . 
  we just need a greek invasion and we 'll get our shit together shortly after . 
  they can . 
  nowadays everybody wan na talk like they got something to say but nothing comes out when they move their lips just a bunch of gibberish and motherfuckers act like they forgot about cyprus, 
  turkish is the official language of an eu member state , which is the bulk of the argument . 
  if russian and catalan are official languages as well then by all means they should be as well . 
  the conflict in turkey was born out of assimilation . 
  your very much allowed to have your opinion , but assimilation for non-immigrant groups ( and yes after 500 years your no longer an immigrant ) to me personally is mistreatment . 
  as i said before , the eu and practically every nation gives us shit for this all time anyways . 
  bulgars , osman , the seljuks , oghuz tribes are all very much a part of turkish identity in the balkans . 
  i never claimed that turkey has any right to those lands , but its also does have cultural connections with it . 
  even ignoring turkic continuity , the ottomans ruling over that land for 5 centuries also gives turkey cultural relevance over the land . 
  you compare it colonies , but what colonies lasted for half a millennium ? 
  very few european groups are their `` original land '' if such a concept even exists . 
  do you treat hungarian minorities in other nations the same , as they are just as foreign to their homeland . 
  or hell look at serbs and kosovo , the entire idea of kosovo being serbian land is based on the myth of the kosovo battle , not because of a historic serbian presence ( and let me know if you want sources on that , i can provide tons ) . 
  in fact there is an entire paper on how the serbian nationality is based on culture significance rather than historic presence , ( i.e. 
  those mountains were in our poems therefore they are important to our nation even if no serbs have ever inhabited that land , its called `` serbian mental space and national identity '' by george w white ) . 
  bosnians use a bosniak identity when that was also a small insignificant tribe that most historians agree has little to do with modern bosnia . 
  or look at greece and the pontics , its a cultural group distinct from greeks ( yet related ) , and yet it was used a pretence to try and capture the black sea coast , it was due to this cultural relevance that was felt . 
  as i said before the ottomans do n't have connections with a modern turkish identity either , ataturk and the nationalists fought the ottomans , and towards the end the ottomans promoted pan-islamism , it was never a `` turkish '' empire , as being turkish as a concept did n't exist until the 20th century . 
  moving on from that , no matter what the history is it does n't give anyone the right to mistreat a nations minorities . 
  just like its awful how whites are treated in various parts of africa ( something i 'm assuming you do n't support ) . 
  these people have literally nothing personally to do with the injustices of the past , but they have every right to express their identity . 
  turkic is more then a linguistic identifier . 
  a turkish identity did n't exist 700 years ago either , it was created but nationalists in the 19th and 20th century . 
  that said turks trace our history back to turkic tribes like osman and the ottomans , alp aslan and the sekjuks , etc. 
  ffs do n't tell me that turks arnt related to turkic groups that 's beyond idiotic . 
  my point is that turkish history ( which very much correlates to turkic history ) is exenstive in the region . 
  who cares what the difference in time is , that culture has been present for hundreds of years , `` but we were here first '' does n't allow for human rights violations . 
  jesus christ the entire eu gives us shit for this with the kurds and then does the exact same . 
  ugh , quebecois are a product of colonialism , imperialism , and genocide , no different ( actually far worse , bulgarians still exist , native americans are in a pathetic situation right now ) then turks in bulgaria , and france is a much a homeland to them as turkey is for bulgarian turks ( both are looked down open in their `` home countries '' ) . 
  also turkic history is pretty extensive , its funny that you mention 681 with the establishment of the first bulgarian empire when that was literally a turkic tribe ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgars ) . 
  i seriously doubt that there are villages were people do n't speak bulgarian , just ones were turkish is the primary language . 
  i do n't see how its an issue for a minority that has lived on a land for half a century to speak their native language . 
  just as the french did in canada or the kurds in turkey . 
  while you may not have implied this being the case , its obvious that theres some hypocrisy in these cases , and they are not treated the same . 
  we were talking about quebec , should they have assimilated as well ? 
  genetically those turks in bulgaria are mostly bulgarian , so ethnicity they are native to the region . 
  their culture has been present in the region for at the very least 500 years but could be even longer ( turkic tribes had existed their since at least 500-600ad the bulgars tribe originally being a turkic tribe as well ) . 
  bulgaria is their homeland by all measures . 
  so did canada for the majority of its existence . 
  while recent incidents have made relations a lot better , turkey and ukraine have actually had pretty healthy relations since the 90s . 
  i think pontic could be considered a separate dialect , and at one point there was a sizeable pontic population on the black sea coast . 
  he 's currently in a domestic abuse trial as well . 
  if i had to guess , we were involved in one way or another . 
  lol what 's up with your hate boner for turkey , literally every time i see you you 're bitching about turkey . 
  makes me proud that some canadian is so wrapped up with our country . 
  anyways if you mean isis then you can provide your copy and pasted barrage of links half which have nothing to do with isis the other half being debunked or fraudulent , but i do n't have the time or energy right now so do n't expect a response . 
  as i said i doubt the russians really care , but legally it would have some pretty big repercussions . 
  yes . 
  the 90s are n't exactly relevant to current political climate , and as the book says it was n't exactly ever proven . 
  fun fact thessaloniki used to be a jewish majority city , then the balkan wars happened , then world war 2 happened . 
  hey man he was almost a soccer player . 
  plus they have a bit more legitimacy being an elected group . 
  erdogan has been clamping down on hamas though as he recently has tried to reestablish relations with israel . 
  hey i actually know this one !, 
  i wrote in a comment early about the siege of fatsa . 
  well anyways it this small blacksea town that elected communist leadership , and the government clamped down hard on it arresting tons of people .

  it does n't really matter if they do or not . 
  those `` guest workers '' will stay for a very long time because japan needs them to keep their workforce occupied , as japanese population and birthrate wo n't increase anytime soon . 
   where are these refugee limitations being lifted you were telling me about ? 
  i originally meant to write immigrants , but fine . 
   it was < 1 % last time i checked . 
  according to reuters , % 15 . 
  and according to research , this will likely increase many refugees still do n't have their asylum applications approved , and majority of them do n't know german . 
   nowhere else is undergoing demographically or culturally transformative levels of immigration in response to subreplacement fertility are you missing ? 
  turkey , pretty much entirety of arabian peninsula bar yemen , most of central asia , pakistan . 
  because it does n't have much to do with wealth . 
  it largely has to do with urbanization and economic prospects . 
  pretty much entirety of europe , sk and japan are heavily urbanized and as such have birthrates . 
  additionally most of those countries no longer see major economic growth , and in quite lot of cases , economic regression or stagnation , and as such birthrates fall lower . 
  as countries like thailand , argentina and so on get more and more urbanized , their birthrate will fall even lower . 
   seriously ? 
   may 2017 : japan rejects more than 99 % of refugee applications  `` accepting only 28 people in 2016 '' https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-25/a-wary-japan-quietly-opens-its-back-door-for-foreign-workers  bet you a million if they do take a non-trivial number of immigrants they 'll be koreans . 
  they have roughly 2 million immigrants , likely to rise , majority of them being chinese and south-east asian . 
  so yeah , give me my million now . 
   if it keeps doubling every decade but the native britons ' birthrate is below replacement then where will we be 2050 ? 
  immigrants have neither the birthrate nor the immigration rate to outnumber britons by then . 
   they were only able to deport a small fraction who lost their asylum cases . 
  and ? 
  still does not change the fact that it 's not a neccessity at the moment , so government does n't really care . 
   western consumerism is spreading like cancer ? 
  who knew ? 
  yeah , it 's not like socialist countries also boast a low birth rate . 
  ussr for example had a below replacement rate . 
  muh western exceoptionalism . 
   you know what they wo n't be doing ? 
  importing people who 'll replace their culture , my point which all your argumentation is avoiding . 
  except a lot of those countries have immigrant populations and net immigration rates similar to european countries . 
  and immigration rate is not high enough to replace europeans anytime soon , and most of sub-replacement rate countries that are not taking refugees will face severe economical problems that are much less likely to affect europe . 
   russia 's tanked because of the fall of the ussr and as far as i know they 're succeeding in increasing it . 
  it largely fall because russia 's death rate was ridicilously high , and their birth-rate is still fairly low . 
   japan values its own people and culture so much it would rather ignore the western naysayers and deal with the effects of an aging population than have immigration . 
  last few years japan has already removed certain limitations for refugees several times . 
  and no , they are not just going to deal with it . 
  according to pm abe , japan 's biggest problem is it 's aging population and country 's number 1 priority is to keep the population above 100m . 
  however projections show that it will likely fall below 100m by 2050 , even with several government programs trying to stop it . 
   china purposefully wanted to reduced its population . 
  and despite lifting one-child restriction several years ago , their birthrate is only barely rising , and it 's way below replacement rate . 
  what i wonder is , will you be able to find excuses for the remaining 120 countries with sub-replacement birth rate ? 
   britain 's muslim population has doubled in a decade . 
  and it 's still below 3 million , only % 4 of the population . 
   look at germany 's population pyramid ; its birthrate is catastrophic . 
  how many million mena men there now ? 
  roughly 4-5 million , depending on whether you count turks or not . 
   ( remember the stories the other year about germany being unable to deport more than a handful at a time ? ) . 
  because it 's not a neccessity at the moment . 
  do you also happen to be a navy seal with 300 confirmed kills ? 
  the big mistake was destabilizing me and maghreb . 
  people , including gaddafi warned that destabilizing mena would result in refugees from those regions flowing freely . 
  good thing i do n't know german then . 
  according to most reports , yes , it 's roughly around that number . 
   they , unlike the australians turning boats back , are robots programmed with a piece of legalese written for post-ww2 europe refugees , not the world 's economic migrants ? 
  too bad europe does not have an entire ocean between it and africa . 
   the western economy is driven by consumerism and population growth , but its culture sinks its own birthrates , mmm , love me some western exceptionalism . 
  pretty much every developing and developed , urbanized coutries face sinking birthrates , from spain , to russia , to iran , to china and to japan . 
  this is not some strange european phenomenon . 
   on the other hand , you have those who have a suicidally foolish confidence in themselves , blind to the evidence . 
  you know the type : `` we can do this '' , `` others have failed at diversity , but we 're exceptional '' , `` we have the means to integrate everyone '' , `` we 'll host an islamic reformation '' . 
  they 've gone from we 'll be the best at conquering the world to we 'll be the best at being conquered by it . 
  or maybe people are not delusional enough to think a continent containing 750 million people and centuries of history will not be completely annihilated because of a few million refugees , especially when both the government and the people have the capacity to kick them out if need be . 
   it doesnt even explain why it 's a suicide . 
  because obviously , some 2 to 3 million brown people will destroy europe and all 750 million people living in it . 
  all hope is lost , repent now . 
  he technically was , however american electoral system is stupid enough that having the most votes does not make you win . 
  because erdo\u011fan in headlines does not get clicks or sell newspaper . 
  meanwhile a stupid typo trump makes is circlejerked into oblivion . 
  turkey is already building a wall on iran border iirc . 
  and the fear is not that they will continue their lives . 
  fear is that they 'll join pkk and starting attacking turkey . 
  unless they get into a war with assad , not all of them will need to stay in syria . 
  many of them , including like turkish citizens will try to enter turkey . 
  while that 's true , the war will end in a year or so . 
  where will all those kurdish fighters go when the war is over ? 
  maybe the gun was in his hand and the guy just was able to grab it ? 
  no one knows . 
  but some sources say that they saw donald trump snorkeling near lesbos . 
  a lot of people do n't want to waste their 20s on torturously looking after a kid that may or may not be a disappointment . 
  a lot of people also dont feel comfortable bringing a kid to a world they do n't feel optimistic about . 
  but governments do n't seem to think so . 
  japan 's one of most important priorities at the moment is keeping population above 100m , which might indicate automation might not be as beneficial as we might think . 
  the problem is that at one point we wo n't have anyone at all . 
  but the problem is that you are going to have to stop population decline at one point , otherwise we will end up with a lot of countries with very minimal population that might virtually not even exists while a massive majority of it 's internal workings are done by machines . 
  he is very conservative about bomb production . 
   viable solution exists . 
  the problem is that we do n't really have one , and unless we go back to days of 0 birth control and de-urbanize , there is not much indicating a solution really exists . 
  automation and ai are a solution to the economy , but not the falling population . 
  and it 's possible that automation itself can make people less likely to want to make babies . 
  a lot of governments are already doing those , and they are helping only slightly . 
  the problem with birthrate goes beyond just incentives . 
  people no longer see having a child or having a family particularly important . 
  the problem with birthrates go beyond just welfare programs . 
  the problem is not just shrinking population , but an increase of dependant population , who will be paid by young people , who will due to that see a decrease in their economic situation , and so on . 
  how do you plan to increase the birthrate then ? 
  and what 's your plan about your second point ? 
  please tell me about your magical economic model that does n't shrink when workforce also shrinks . 
   i am kurdish , i am from dersim , and you are a straight up liar , honor killings are not rampant , making shit up and your grim picture you try to paint of kurdish areas to mislead people and then hypocritically talk about propaganda campaigns . 
  actual statistics disagree with you : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/honor_killing#turkey,

  the 23rd of april commemorates the foundation of the parliament in 1920 , 19th of may commemorates the start of the war of independence in 1919 , 30th of august the final battle in the war in 1922 , and 29th of october the official declaration of the republic in 1923 . 
  each of these is celebrated in schools , as well as in large events in the major cities . 
  in turkey there are n't any special exams for graduating high school , you just need to pass 12th grade as you need to pass the others . 
  however , there is a massive two-stage exam that consists of 6 sessions - 1 in mid-march and 5 in mid-june - that determines whether you can go to university and which ones . 
  students usually spend the entire 12th grade studying for those exams , even neglecting normal school . 
  i once met someone from rural netherlands on the internet . 
  he said the people of amsterdam are `` efficient to the point of rudeness '' . 
  honestly , i do n't see why that 's a bad thing . 
  turkey has a similar system with one nation-wide exam in march , followed by a set of 5 in june , and special schools called * dershane * that most students go to in addition to normal high school , although we usually study for one year . 
  during my time in high school , within 4 years , 7 high school students committed suicide in the nearby metro station . 
  i live in ankara and it 's usually 6-7 liras in the cheap student bars in kizilay . 
  an easy and relatively accurate way of converting celsius to fahrenheit is doubling the celsius value and adding 32 . 
  if you want to be more accurate , multiply by 1,8 instead of 2 . 
  depending on how fancy the bar is and which type of beer you get , a 0,5 l beer costs anywhere between 6-12 liras ( 1,55-3 ,10 eur , 1,70-3 ,40 usd ) . 
  some fancy bars also have an entrance fee of around 25 liras ( 6,40 eur , 7,05 usd ) . 
  it 's treason then . 
  with ... celery ? 
  seriously ? 
  yeah , you would n't have to endure the peanut butter . 
  but the bread is already savory . 
  you can just put less nutella and the bread will balance it out ? 
  turkey . 
  we have meatballs too but no one seems to know . 
  they look like these : [ regular ] ( https://www.gurmerehberi.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/12/inegol-kofte.jpg ) , [ uncooked ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/turkish_%c3%a7i%c4%9f_k%c3%b6fte.jpg/1200px-turkish_%c3%a7i%c4%9f_k%c3%b6fte.jpg ) and [ `` watery '' ] ( http://www.hurrem.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/sulu-kofte-tarifi.jpg ), 
  well , there are two kinds of turkish nationalism : mhp are , as i said , conservative supremacists ; but chp , who are post-revolutionary nationalists , are leftists . 
  before hdp came about , chp was * the * leftist party in parliament . 
  e : btw , hdp did n't weaken chp either . 
  you see , the opposition parties do n't do much in turkey . 
  since akp has parliamentary majority , it can do whatever it wants and the other parties ca n't do anything they want . 
  so really , it does n't matter as long as their vote remains over 10 % . 
  i think it 's just that they 've talked about it more . 
  before the last election , they were the only party that even mentioned lgbt rights , they also talked a lot about environmental issues . 
  they have a lot of women mps and even two co-leaders , one of which is a woman . 
  other parties have also approached similar issues , but focused on them a lot less . 
  for example , all three of the other major parties placed more women in their rosters compared to previous terms , but they were still behind hdp . 
  they managed to snag some of the votes of the people who did n't care much about the kurds , but cared about the environment for example . 
  although these votes were primarily taken from chp , so it did n't do much to weaken akp 's position . 
  in my experience , kurdish independence groups usually have a leftist undertone ( pkk is literally short for kurdistan workers ' party , for example ) . 
  although i do n't think any other group has managed to bring it to the foreground to garner the support of turkish leftists before . 
  yes , most of the people that emigrated to europe were of lower classes and akp dominates the lower class demographic . 
  furthermore , living among so many christians can increase one 's muslim victim complex . 
  i 'm sorry you guys got involved in our mess , good luck with your elections . 
  it is , erdogan and the media are stoking the flames to increase the yes votes in the referendum . 
  it 's feeding their victim complex . 
  akp , or justice and development party is one of the more recent additions to turkish politics but they 've succeeded some other parties , which were largely unsuccessful . 
  to understand their views and their voters , one must examine the political history of the country . 
  turkey was founded on secular ideals but not everyone agreed with these , it was n't much of a people 's revolution . 
  for several decades , the state suppressed islamism , or rather anything it perceived as islamism : for example , for a long while it was illegal to wear a headscarf in any education institution ( including universities ) or in state departments . 
  akp was born out of that decades of victimisation ; when erdogan , who had been arrested for reading a poem that criticized the regime in public , ( and some others ) founded the party , many muslims saw it as a chance at religious freedom . 
  you probably know how it turned out once akp took power . 
  chp , or republican people 's party is one of the oldest parties in the republic , and it is the oldest according to official history ( some sources claim the communist party is older ) . 
  chp was founded by the original mps of the turkish parliament , during the revolution , and it still follows those guiding principles more or less . 
  however , in practice , its rhetoric has shifted towards an anti-akp one . 
  it seems as if the party 's only goal now is replacing akp , they have no clear policy goals . 
  parliamentary sessions often turn into shouting matches between akp and chp mps , and each party opposes proposals by the other on principle , regardless of the contents of the proposals . 
  they used to have a stronger rhetoric , but they lost their spirit when their leader resigned after erdogan revealed a video recording of him having extra-marital sex in a hotel . 
  mhp , or nationalist movement party is one of the lesser known parties abroad . 
  they are pretty much turkic supremacists . 
  while they are vocally muslim , they do n't advocate for islamist policies . 
  their policies are classically conservative , sometimes economically leaning towards socialism . 
  they advocate for raising the minimum wage , they sometimes even talk about basic income . 
  however , the bulk of their rhetoric is about a strong state , with a strong military commanded by a strong leader . 
  their leadership has recently conceded that erdogan might become this strong leader , though their voters are n't entirely convinced . 
  hdp , or peoples ' [ sic ] democratic party is the most recent one among the major parties . 
  it surfaced as the major kurdish party after the previous one , dtp was shut down by order of the supreme court over allegations of supporting terrorism . 
  like previous kurdish parties , it advocates for greater freedom for the kurdish people living in turkey , such as the right to receive education primarily in kurdish ; they are also the furthest-left party in parliament , they frequently take anti-war , pro-lgbt , feminist and environmentalist stances . 
  unfortunately , a lot of people see them as terrorist supporters , referring to their entry into the parliament as a `` pkk infiltration of government '' . 
  do n't quote me on this but i think hdp also has the largest percentage of women mps and is the only party with multiple people as co-leaders . 
  there are numerous other parties , but none of them have any seats in parliament and are n't likely to get any in the near future because in turkey , you need to get at least 10 % of the popular vote to get any seats . 
  we have a trump but it ceased to be amusing long ago . 
  well , that 's not the scientific meaning . 
  fyi , if by take home income you mean income after tax , the official term is disposable income . 
  i 'm pretty sure europe is the canada of europe . 
  it 's not legal but it 's not punishable either . 
  however , if the light is red for you , you cross anyway , and a car hits you , you 'll be solely responsible . 
  on the other hand , if there is n't a light , only a crosswalk , it 's completely legal to cross anytime and cars have to stop if there are people crossing . 
  we have the * t\u00fcrk dil kurumu * ( turkish language institute ) . 
  they are in charge of standardizing , and sometimes simplifying and modernising turkish , as well as publishing and maintaining the official , exhaustive turkish dictionary . 
  it 's alright . 
  its user base is pretty consistent with the turks in european subs and in reddit in general , which is to say it does n't represent the country 's population very well . 
  also , it 's nice to have a place to ask about local things without having to sign up to a weird local website with an unfamiliar design . 
  yeah , i know :(, 
  regional governing bodies similar to municipalities are necessary , i agree . 
  what i meant is that they should derive their power solely from the united earth state , not the other way around . 
  i think the un needs to be restructured so that the authority lies with the general assembly , rather than the security council , and that no country has unilateral veto power . 
  then , i think the un should be granted greater authority over member states and absolute authority over other international organisations like wto and imf . 
  i also think the long term goal of the un should be transforming into a global , unitary government with democratic representation and completely replacing regional governments . 
  i also think a mixed economy should still exist for luxury goods and services . 
  the state should only provide for necessities . 
  not only healthcare , i think the state should provide free public transportation , electricity , drinking water , internet access , 16 years of education , basic housing and basic income for consumables to every citizen . 
  i spend most of my day at [ school ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5tfbth85-u ) when it 's not winter break . 
  ( i do n't take the bus very often but it was the best video i could find of the campus . ), 
  i think the campus is so beautiful that i actually feel proud to be a part of it . 
  most of these look pretty good . 
  you 're probably not going to get any new commenters , since it 's already at 0 points ; but you might be able to salvage a conversation with the people that are already here . 
  maybe you 'd like to rephrase your question , edit the post , in a way that is n't ridiculously vague ? 
  the confusion stems from the difference between classical liberalism and social liberalism . 
  there 's nothing subjective about it . 
  classical liberalism advocates for utmost liberty for the individual , minimal state that only serves to protect life and property of the individual against direct attacks ( theft , murder and war ) , and a market economy free of state intervention . 
  social liberalism says the state has to intervene , especially economically , to preserve individual liberties .

it is maybe crazy because it seems most rational not to kill yourself , and if the world is worthless it is better to kill yourself with lesser pain . 
  i think that for humans social aspects are much more important than the rational ones , although i ca n't tell how , when and why . 
  i used to have the thoughts of sacrificing myself for others , as some of my friends and some writers ( i would quote proust ) had . 
  what if it turns the other way , the people/society you would sacrifice yourself for is actually morally corrupt and you are only someone to exploit for their good . 
  you are someone who is just over-socialized , and it is definitely in bad way . 
  exposing yourself to such world only gives sorrow . 
  i am just trying to make a point that suicides can be a result of social mechanisms of a person that is n't defined/accepted in the modern society , although it mostly relates to my personal experience . 
  i used to look down upon suicidal people too in the past . 
  why crazy ? 
  i know you will say that she commit suicide in public by burning herself , but suicides are closely related to society itself . 
  even one of the first sociological article was about suicide and how much it related . 
  she probably have not come terms with how we live in . 
  suicidal people are n't necessarily crazy . 
  it helps when you come to power after a crisis which only began by the incompetency of the prior leaders . 
  so it is just regular growth of turkey , only that it has just much more stability http://www.tradingeconomics.com/turkey/gdp-per-capita compare years from here akp 's one of the most prominent election slogan was `` stability '', 
  islamic butthurt since ataturk edit : from what i think most of the base of voters has islamic roots and the democracy of majority is a huge compromise from secularity , especially in the rhetoric . 
  with the tendency of becoming a dictator leaders like erdogan and menderes tended to rely on `` ballot '' in which both called `` democracy '' and suppressed those who criticized him in any sense . 
  for significant amount of them secularity was a mistake and ataturk was no more than a dictator who imposed his wills on the people . 
  however they wo n't say it out loud . 
  their authoritarianism can be compared to the russia , as they are a `` majority '' country like turkey which is strictly turkish sunni country . 
  askreddit iama has lots of them, 
  wake up wakeeeeeeee uppp !!!, 
  he is saying if you possess the capability of attacking capital in 5 minutes you might as well turn every country there against them , its absurd you wo n't branded as `` aggressive '' . 
  if you are gon na make an enemy out of russia , you might as well add finland and sweden to nato . 
  why not , they are worse than hitler and literally `` autistic '' . 
  i do n't want to talk about how perverse the usa foreign policy in sa anyway . 
  what usa did to sa is very comparable to what ussr did to hungary . 
  apparently polarizing worked for usa , and they are the winners , so they are `` writers '' , and no one condemns them for the almost starting the world war due to polarizing foreign policies or supporting massacres throughout foreign juntas . 
  edit : i am sorry to say that usa is literally russia . 
  no , it has supported and is continually supporting democracy . 
  if it was n't for usa we all would be slaves to our russian overlords . 
  we have become murderers ( ? ), 
  i like the words like `` western liberalism '' , in all of the sentences . 
  west stinks , etc. 
  implying russian authoritarianism as oppressing the dissidents , the dissidents are in turn labeled like cia agents , as traitors . 
  diminishing russian influence on your country is immediately labeled by transformation to fascism . 
  still even though a person 's power is limited , in no way mhp would limit the fundamental authority of the state in matters such as police force and censorship , they would only limit dictatorship not of their kind . 
  edit : their nationalism is kind of what can be called fascism , even though their voters are n't fascists , only nationalists with a disregard for bureaucratic , way too secular chp and an alienation towards islamist akp . 
  their most renowned leader was alpaslan t\u00fcrke\u015f , most prominent leader of 60 coup who was expelled by a seemingly puppet but popular cemal g\u00fcrsel because of his extremely authoritarian views such as intolerance towards existence of any other political party . 
  i would say , as much as akp saw themselves the only solution towards the problem of secularity on the right wing ( rightfully but that does n't explain the butthurtedness of the akp media in last election ) mhp tries to emulate a turkish problem which is similar to akp in deed . 
  acquire majority since appealing to turkish right is the best way of getting it , and make sure that you hold the system after pseudo democracy , but their egos are way too big to see that they 're are the same with akp thus they will fail , unless mhp succeeds in dismantling hdp , which i think lawfully impossible since akp tried to protect itself from dismantling . 
  they are both authoritarian so it will be especially worse, 
  statistics oversimplify it , just as you do with the `` cultural war '' thing . 
  at best freedom of speech is good . 
  however what i am asking for is some sort of reflection on matters such that a teenager in britain can go to jail because he cursed the british troops in afghan soil . 
  the concept is n't even working justly , while my point about how the notion of `` freedom of speech '' used as cultural superiority in this case is completely ignored . 
  i am against radicalization which extremists on both sides support , i am not fan of muslim community myself , if i hold a side . 
  why am i keeping to hit to the wall when i say this is political problem , but when i try to dispel the supposedly `` pure ideological '' roots of it , my answer is `` he is a politician '' . 
  when i say the problem is politics about immigrants ( and even more ) , you show me a statistic that nowhere solves the problem , on the contrary deepens it . 
  he is using `` freedom of speech '' as an essential western value ( in fact only to be gained in the 20th century ) in which , in this value a cultural superiority is established by insults lacking any kind of sophistication nor rumination . 
   you are not an asset to any community , at least i am not part of any circlejerking . 
  i was under the impression that he was saying that , as he is a notorious anti-immigrant . 
  the problem is n't in anyway either of islam or christianity is superior not islam is a bad religion . 
  the problem is immigrants , religion or `` ideology '' is just a part of the problem of it . 
  so i am talking about the intolerance towards the immigrants , which some of it has racist tendencies in it , or a sort of superiority that wilders is promoting as something that is a result of the struggle for free speech , while in fact its whole purpose is being ignorant/intolerant . 
  they would have won when muslims are much more oppressed in the western world so they would become in the same side with the extremists , as the westerners would hate immigrants more . 
  this is n't about a war of cultural superiority , only a way of political and international relations imposed into this cultural relationship . 
  further this western - islamic tension continues without compromises on both sides the worse it will get . 
  i am not saying this should be censored . 
  i am saying that if europeans politically think they are simply superior and as a result be intolerant of the muslim communities this issue wo n't be resolved . 
  so he is closing borders to an ideology ? 
  they would have less reasons to hate muslims if they did n't exist as immigrants in their own country . 
  which is what this guy 's politics is all about . 
  that does have nothing to do with the pissing of the muslims under the protection of freedom of speech , this is just racist - ignorant rampant and it should not be sympathized with any way . 
  charlie hebdo was n't racist , but this politician is . 
  he is a hypocrite who tries to imply that europeans are better because they would tolerate satirizing of another culture which is not well liked , further deepening radicalization . 
  at the least he would never do this to his own religion . 
  the kurd problem would be severed drastically . 
  aside from that mhp is at best akp wannabe so they would compete each other , and it would be fun to watch, 
  you are mistaken in balkan immigrants attitude towards religion . 
  it is a better explanation that the immigrants were much more symphatetic of the idea of being turks . 
  in contrast , other areas have much more traditional ideas transended to religion through the suppression . 
  as no one will say that they arent turk in today , they will adhere to conservatism in proving they are better even with facing the paradox that the elites of a region are essentially are getting apart from it . 
  good . 
  to be fair they are harvested when they are babies , not when they are scarlett johanssons, 
  * frank herbert ? 
  it is possible to torture terrorists as long as you are a superpower , even though they are protected by human rights originally ? 
  to be fair they dont have a stereotype as bad as arabs . 
  it may be likely that the homeless in the vicinity increased then they heard complaints from other people . 
  [ link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegian_butter_crisis ), 
  its more of a bourgeouis morality than a pure investing on science . 
  i think what happens today, 
  i dont think societies want to advance scientifically . 
  they rather want prosperity . 
  on another note it is weird that science is considered progression but such a conversation on morality is hindered , and eventually decimated by politics due to politics nature . 
  even science as you said is bound by it . 
  yeah , but i am skeptic about what he meant by western societies promoting science . 
  science was valued as how much technological progress and power it would bring , not like there was a pure/genuine interest about science/reason in the society so westerns are superior because of it, 
  i mean that science isnt innocent as we ought to believe as in its progression, 
  they are like 2000 years back in religion though , believing in supersitition or foretelling . 
  and i dont know what you are referencing =(, 
  nah , thats because they hate you for decades and covertly infilrate the bureucratic and judicial system through sects . 
  much later they decide to make military incapable of a coup that would be deemed in order to uphold `` constitutional rights '' which were `` violated '' by the government . 
  then you have a turkey with a president that wants excessive power because they felt they were butthurt when they could n't use clothes . 
  its not because they colonized the world because they valued truth and knew how to use it . 
  that is simply / r/badhistory , they valued power so the truth , the relationship between power and science is very complex and the idea that truth prevailed power hides how the institutions of science were found on and were sympathetic to the power they believed in . 
  science itself maybe is the saviour , but it may not be the science as we and our ancestors have known . 
  consider eugenics for example , or the idea that africans were racially inferior . 
  their roots do not lie in what should be considered science , they lie in the power scientists were sympathetic to , which pointed that they were in fact inferior through dominance . 
  also wwi was the war of rational thoughts/superiorities of nations , and most of the western nations participated were sympathetic to idea of war because of that .

  these lists are prepared by parties , the secret service , the g\u00fclenists etc and include sivil servants , teachers , journalists , businessmen ... 
  many of these lists have been leaked . 
  edit : this http://imgur.com/f0mw1gv is an example of an old list about airport directors , prepared by erdo\u011fan 's party . 
  political orientation , religiosity , closeness to g\u00fclen , their opinion about erdo\u011fan , if he drinks alcohol ... all included in the list , which played a role on who would be appointed as an a\u015frport director in 2013 . 
  no , i tried to show one way they used to infiltrate the state . 
  another way : a g\u00fclenist newspaper blames innocent but anti-g\u00fclenist civil servants for something . 
  they are sent to the court , g\u00fclenist judges put them in jail . 
  now you are free to fill their position with people close to you . 
  they did that in the [ ergenekon trials ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ergenekon_trials ) for example . 
  i understand and i am worried too , because i am sure that many of the people removed have nothing to do with g\u00fclen . 
  they are just people not loyal to erdo\u011fan . 
  you said you dont udnerstand why and i tried to give an explanation . 
  the 23 tv stations whose license was revoked for example , where close to the g\u00fclen movement . 
  example : when there were exams for law graduates to become judges , g\u00fclenists from the exam commitee shared the questions with loyal students . 
  most new judges were g\u00fclenists . 
  this happened in many branches ( police , university entry exams etc ), 
  im not condoning his actions just giving an explanation , please dont downvote . 
  erdo\u011fan blames the [ g\u00fclen movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g\u00fclen_movement ) for the coup . 
  the movement 's main job is education . 
  they control 140 charter schools in the us for example . 
  they own/control thousands of schools , universities and training centres in turkey . 
  their graduates have infiltrated the state mechanism in the last years . 
  this is an attempt to clean the state mechanism from them . 
  he has been doing pro-erdo\u011fan propaganda since the coup attempt . 
  erdo\u011fan shills are trying to discredit the leaks https://np.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/4tn9kr/wikileaks_we_appear_to_have_won_our_24h_cyberwar/d5is1qv https://np.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/4tnci3/release_294548_emails_from_turkeys_ruling/d5iz39h, 
  nah , we 've been doing so since always . 
  my fellow muslim brothers are doing allah 's work already there !, 
  you are correct , but my post above is correct too . 
  g\u00fclen 's role in the ergenekon trials is very basic knowledge for anyone living here . 
  i had other plans but now i will come to norway and make you a muslim , 
  they are literally the same people . 
  general adem huduti for example . 
  the head of the 2 . 
  army , responsible for the southeast . 
  1st of march 2016 : [ adem huduti , the commander who cleaned cizre and \u015e\u0131rnak ] ( http://www.sabah.com.tr/gundem/2016/03/01/iste-cizre-ve-suru-temizleyen-komutan-org-adem-huduti ) 18th of july 2016 : [ commander of the 2 . army adem huduti arrested ] ( http://www.sabah.com.tr/gundem/2016/07/18/2-ordu-komutani-adem-huduti-tutuklandi ) there are tens of generals who murdered kurds and razed kurdish cities , and are now accused of organizing the coup . 
  i tried . 
  i demonstrated , i voted , i observed the elections and guarded the ballot , i did what i could via social media . 
  there is not one opposition . 
  leftists ( kurds and turks ) , secular kemalists , nationalist kemalists and nationalists all hate each other . 
  i dont want to get hurt or land in jail . 
  fuck this country , i will be soon in the eu . 
  dont worry , im a good guy . 
  he was controlling these institutions before as well . 
  and he was an oppressive dictator already , i wonder what will happen now . 
  you wrongly call me an akp voter , this shows that you are not aware of the sociopolitic dynamics in turkey . 
  g\u00fclenists have caused a lot of suffering to the seculars/kemalists . 
  to infiltrate the state they had seculars imprisoned or driven away . 
  and they are one of the largest enemy of the kurds . 
  in cooperation with nationalists , nationalist kemalists and islamists they fought and murdered thousand of kurds . 
  in the cities where the kurds/pkk are dominant , the g\u00fclenists could not and have not founded any schools . 
  my country has been go\u0131ng to shit since many year . 
  i will be out soon . 
  are they g\u00fclenists for sure ? 
  i dont know . 
  but the same people who have been murdering the kurds in these last months are the people who organized ( or just executed ) the coup . 
  you know who came for the kemalists and the kurds ? 
  the g\u00fclenists , they ones who apparently organized the coup . 
  against kemalists : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ergenekon_trials one of the coup organizers was praised by a government mouthpiece just last week for his fight against kurds : https://twitter.com/erdalimrek/status/755037154372452353, 
  we dont know the perpetrators yet . 
  i dont know the guy , but he is secular antierdo\u011fan and probably not on the side of g\u00fclen . 
  i didnt remember his words . 
  he said `` yes , in a unitary state the presidential system can be applied ... there are many examples , like hitler 's germany in the past and many different countries '' . 
  he didnt say `` all i want is same powers as hitler '' , as the title says . 
  sorry i deleted mu reply because i had to go and wouldnt be able to keep answering . 
  there are the turks you talk about , which are roughly half of the population . 
  and then there is [ us ] ( https://www.google.com.tr/search?q=gezi+olaylar%c4%b1&amp;safe=off&amp;prmd=ivn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch ) . 
  we did protest , and we were millions . 
  im not asking for a military intervention . 
  freezing the assets of [ corrupt members ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gezi_park_protests ) of the government responsible for so [ many deaths ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gezi_park_protests ) , freezing the eu accession process and declaring some people personae non gratae would be something . 
  these people have nothing to do with the coup nor were they blamed for it . 
  alevis are one of the perpetual victims and scapegoats for islamists . 
  whenever muslims feel strong enough they will attack them . 
  thats not what he said . 
  he said something like `` the [ parliamentary republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliamentary_republic ) is not inherently good , look at hitler '' sorry for not looking up the source and translating , but it is a very old article and has been debunked before . 
  istanbul is not a secularist stronghold , \u0130zmir is . 
  most of these people were not part of the coup . 
  they will be accused of being members of the [ g\u00fclen movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g\u00fclen_movement ) , once erdo\u011fan 's closest ally but now designated as a terrorist organization by the turkish government . 
  we are concerned , but come on , saddam killed [ hundreds of thousands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-anfal_campaign ) . 
  you will stop being a softy european . 
  islamic terrorism , coups , a national liberation struggle , jihadists , modern feminists , muslim greek and levantine architecture , leftist terrorism , ghettos , gypsy neighborhoods , strong police presence without rule of law ... all you need is to walk 30 minutes in istanbul . 
  ( this post sounded much better in my mind ), 
  his motives were quite obvious to us . 
  in his speeches he said that '' [ democracy is a tool ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdbaunq5b2w ) '' , that '' [ you can not be both secular and muslim ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjc-nuv4wrq ) '' and he was even [ imprisoned for citing an islamist poem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recep_tayyip_erdo\u011fan#imprisonment ) ( first two links in turkish , last one in english ) . 
  when did merkel say that ? 
  i fully agree with the rest of your post , but i need a source on this claim :  pursued / `` adviced '' by european institutions to antagonize akp, 
  kerry does not mention nato membership in his speech, 
  copying from another post : - 7.899 policemen ( 3.021 of them high ranking ) - 30 province governors - 92 vice province-governors - 41 district governors - 2.745 judges and attorneys ( out of 12.000 total ) sources : http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/icisleri-bakanliginda-buyuk-operasyon-8-bin-777-personel-gorevden-uzaklastirildi-40152472 http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/2-bin-745-hakim-ve-savci-icin-gozalti-karari-cikti-40149496 this is a huge purge .

  - the army is generally secular . 
  - before the coup i thought that the army was neutered . 
  i dont know any more . 
  - we dont know yet if the coup was organized by seculars or [ by a religious sect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g\u00fclen_movement ) - the secular citizens are people like you .

  i think it 's a case of butthurt at the result of being denied by eu master race . 
  i remember some negative remarks from europe back in the day , like from sarkozy . 
  turks believe europeans think of turks as barbarians who has no place in europe , so people started to dislike europe as time went by . 
  combined with butthurt , the mindset changed from a push to being europeanized to `` huh , we do n't like you and your cool kids club either ! '', 
  that 's not harsh . 
  that 's how a very big majority of turks feel . 
  i read a poll where only 17 % of the population believe in the ascension process in 2012 . so-called eu ascension process became something of a joke over here , but even that joke got old . 
  eu is simply irrelevant nowadays . 
  in europe people seem to think turkey still has a chance which i find weird . 
  in general , turks distrust pretty much every country , but the west probably tops it . 
  i think people feel cheated or something . 
  i think turkey has no place in eu either . 
  edit : fixed a typo . 
  17 % of the population believe in ascension . 
  83 % does n't consider it realistic . 
  i do n't have time atm but google `` our boys in ankara have done it '' maybe someone else turkish will reply soon it aint a conspiracy theory . 
  its kinda common knowledge over here, 
  well , eu is not an option and never will be , even if we get rid of erdo\u011fan . 
  i think turkey will try to juggle every relationship as far as possible . 
  if turkey wants to join an organization even something like shanghai cooperation organisation ( which russia and china is in ) is a more realistic goal than eu . 
  it sucks , but that 's what we got, 
  there are no independent and vocal generals left . 
  akp replaced them all . 
  there is nothing that can topple him internally at the moment . 
  his only real enemy is fethullah and his cult , which is simply another power-hungry islamist very much like erdo\u011fan . 
  they were allies years back but you know what happens when power-hungry leaders ally . 
   what the hell is he thinking ? 
  he is thinking about the elections in june . 
  anti-west rhetoric and `` turkey stronk !, 
  talks are because of that . 
  he might be thinking europe and us are `` plotting '' against him . 
  well , it was us that installed him so i dunno what 's going on in between . 
  us harboring erdo\u011fan 's arch-enemy fethullah caused a divide or something i guess . 
  funny thing we have a word for it . 
  comes with exposure to subs like / r/worldnews and / r/syriancivilwar . 
  half of the stuff said about turks in the latter are just blatant lies . 
  if you correct them then you are the `` brainwashed turk doing bullshit propaganda '' . 
  if you correct them with sources you are just ignored and downvoted lol . 
  they also have a weird sense of morality . 
  after a while you just laugh that stuff off . 
  we are n't angels ourselves anyway . 
  we 'll give you guys some land and let pkk deal with it . 
  or maybe we 'll give it to kurds so you 'll have two countries to get the genocide recognized in to get land from reparations lol . 
  inb4 `` turkey cant into eu '', 
   it is actually funny for a turk to make that claim against greeks , since my grandfather fought against a nazi ally in italy on the albanian front and all my relatives lived through nazi occupation bravo to you bro . 
  i 'm pretty sure you are a badass and the most racially tolerable guy in the world by genetic proxy . 
  `` all turks are ultra-nationalists '' do you know how hypocritically racist that sounds like ? 
  most greeks i met are really cool guys . 
  but something is wrong with american-greeks . 
  lol he is greek-american . 
  diasporas in usa which has roots in nations that have been historically enemies with turkey are always like that . 
  more nationalistic the person is , more anti-turkish they are . 
  they think all turks are racists and turkey is still being governed by a kemalist party or something . 
  they live in the past . 
  the have almost no connection to their roots except for this obsession with historical rivalries . 
  we are a society that thinks it 's inching towards a 1984 dystopia while running towards a brave new world dystopia . 
  `` fuck erdo\u011fan '' or `` fuck atat\u00fcrk '' depending on the guy you are talking to . 
  typical sensationalist titles . 
  but even that sounds funny . 
  he is gon na fuck up economics soon . 
  that 's the only thing that can get him out of office now . 
  we are inching towards an economical crisis . 
  media is under control of akp . 
  the average akp voter does n't exactly stroll through websites like reddit , guardian , and so on . 
  at most they visit facebook . 
   turkey 's state-run media , he complained last week , `` has aired 553 minutes of erdogan 's speeches , compared to three minutes for me '' . 
  [ this quote is from erdo\u011fan 's rival in the presidential elections ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a3f416ca-0c03-11e4-a096-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3v2l7zojz ) election fraud . 
  [ at every election weird stuff happens . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2qjavy/hamas_we_will_liberate_palestine_jerusalem/cn73mpt ) buying votes , electricity blackouts during the election , and so on . 
  lack of centre-right religious parties . 
  all the conservative religious votes are united under the banner of akp . 
  i check polls from time to time , and i noticed something interesting . 
  so , the poll asks questions along the lines of `` erdo\u011fan did this and do you agree with him ? '', 
  several times let 's say 20-30 % says yes in all of them . 
  then the final question comes `` which party you will vote for ? '', 
  that 's when you get at least 40 % . 
  so it seems like people vote for akp because there is n't any other options . 
  bad opposition parties . 
  the left is divided into tens of different parties that are fighting amongst each other and multiplying for everything . 
  even the main opposition party ( chp ) is always in an infighting state . 
  just a few months ago two mp broke off from chp to form their own parties . 
  the way he talks in rallies . 
  abuse of religious and nationalistic feelings . 
  hitler would drop to his knees in awe if he saw him . 
  there are more but those are the main things that keeps akp in power . 
  hey folks , do you know how to accurately guess if someone supports akp ? 
  you look at whether they call it akp or ak parti . 
  i would laugh more if i was n't living in the country he rules . 
  yeah , that 's the way it is with game companies nowadays . 
  i remember the days when i actually liked electronic arts not only for their games , but the way they are . 
  challenge everything . 
  nowadays i only play paradox games , a few roguelikes , and some old games . 
  if you want an educated view , you are in the wrong place . 
  i ca n't be bothered to write a wall of text , but the short version is : turkey 's official stance says that it definitely did happen , but there was n't any intent of systematic ethnic cleansing . 
  that cunt enver pasha fucked it up and blamed it on a whole race of armenians . 
  most of the murders were committed by turkish and kurdish civilians fueled by revenge after seeing their villages in ruins . 
  most men were away fighting , so it was n't difficult to take care of the turkish and kurdish villages quickly with the factor of surprise . 
  the situation devolved into a civil war until the ottoman empire could pull some soldiers from war to intervene . 
  it went from dealing with russia-backed armenian rebels to anyone who is considered an armenian very quickly . 
  ottoman empire wanted to get rid of this incident as soon as possible and focus on war again .

  the only argument for this fantasy independence i 've heard is `` preserve our culture and freedom '' which does n't strike me as a persuasive point . 
  you 're talking about semantics yet you 're the one desperately clinging to it . 
  it shows . 
  what are you trying to get at ? 
  also i fancy postnationalism so i 'm opposed to that too . 
  seems like these guys want segregation under a different name . 
  no it is not . 
  why do you think it is not racist ? 
   a you  b should  c stop  d typing ... like this , this post was not exactly coherent . 
  what i 'm trying to say is why stop there ? 
  let 's deport ( or kill maybe wink wink ) anyone who does n't have any skills over the age of 21 . 
  with their extended families . 
  i do n't know because i 'm not qualified enough and that 's the point . 
  we both do n't know what the fuck we are on about yet you want to restrict freedom of movement for a whole people with the assumption that they wo n't work . 
  let 's deport lazy assholes , repeat offenders and their extended families too , dare ? 
  uh yeah , we 've got 350 year old all-black villages . 
  nothing happened or happens . 
  that 's the only reason ? 
  birth rates ? 
  something 's off . 
  yup . 
  that 's the only solution . 
  nothing else can be done . 
  just build a bigger fence !, 
  oh and no amount of downvotes will quench your frustration to an opposing viewpoint . 
  so immigration from europe and americas is a-ok ? 
  a good way to think about it is this ; think of a mother who was raped and had her husband killed in front of her while trying to raise kids , these kids grow up in abusive or otherwise abnormal households and the cycle of violence and poverty repeats . 
  now apply this to a whole ( largely arbitrary ) nation . 
  it 's a collective shit fest there . 
  man , you really are committed to not let black people in are you ? 
  i remember in / r/shitconservativessay all posts get '' ... and that 's why the liberals are the real racists . '', 
  added at the end . 
  this sub should have something like that . 
  ... and that 's why we should n't let turkey in the eu . 
  more specifically ; human rights do n't exist for humans that we do n't like, 
  ha , the answer to ethnic cleansing is more ethnic cleansing . 
  the turks are there to stay . 
  deal with it . 
  sadly as much as some people do n't like to admit , these lives are just worth more to them . 
  i personally was n't affected by this incident any more than i was for any other killings that happen all the time around the world . 
  also some of them seem to be important researchers and prominent people in general so that takes a toll on our progress as a whole . 
  i am dissappointed in you kazakhstan and azerbaijan ... 
  wish they protected muslims just as much and did n't you know , cleanse them . 
  yeah , sorry about that mates . 
  we are largely taught the big players like mamluks , russians , brits , hapsburgs , venetians , safavis , romans and such . 
  the balkans were merely a single step in the stair to heaven so to say . 
  owned, 
  or they just hated and marginalized turks so much that this caught on . 
  the french know what 's up . 
  dammit , napoleon should n't have ended the franco-ottoman alliance just for egypt that he failed to get . 
  turkish airline . 
  ha , ca n't say we have something similar for romanians since they are not relevant enough [ . 
  so theoretically could they fake the other side out when they are launching an actual nuke ? 
  putin has lipstick on . 
  who 'll be the king ? 
  i 'm everywhere . 
  why are you here ? 
  the atlantic wo n't even let you through . 
   the only real thing preventing the syrian military from crossing your border . 
  lol if syria attacked us we 'd invade tajikistan , fuck them and leave in a decade . 
  what i said was primarily to the `` damned if we do , damned if we do n't ! '', 
  crowd . 
  i never said there was any correlation with intelligence & economic status and racism . 
  kinda why i said `` you know , things can happen for different reasons . '', 
  what are you trying to tell me ? 
  is it so much to ask us that they should cooperate with whoever they are working with ? 
  `` if you do n't let us do what ever we want , we 'll go home . '', 
  how about you help me only when i absolutely need it and do n't barge in uninvited then complain about hypocrisy kind of thing . 
  i read to about `` in 2001 , dna88 joined stormfront ... '' k , i 'll finish it . 
  for example here ;  shocking and should change the way we think about hate . 
   in the 1930s , arthur f. raper reported a correlation between bad economic conditions and lynchings of blacks . 
  this led many scholars to the intuitive conclusion that people turn to hate because their lives are going poorly . 
   but evidence is increasingly casting doubt on this idea . 
  in 2001 , the political scientists donald p. green , laurence h. mcfalls and jennifer k. smith used more data and found that there was actually no relationship between lynchings and economic hardship . 
  lynchings actually fell during the great depression . 
  he makes it sound like people turn to racism just because of bad living standards which is obviously not true . 
  he focuses on people who are actively participating in hate groups like stormfront , kkk and ~ ~ reddit ~ ~ ^ ^ ^ jk . 
   why do some people feel this way ? 
  if i were to be blunt and dismissive i 'd answer this question with `` because they are fucking idiots , period . '', 
  but i 'll just settle with not doing backseat psychoanalysis . 
  but yeah , it 's inherently going to be flawed if you only look at internet statistics in america . 
  this is for people who go to stormfront though . 
  he should 've kept to his field . 
  but anyways , what kind of white supremacist are we talking about and what did they say that made them wss ? 
  the trailer trash or the `` i do n't hire blacks '' guy ? 
   white supremacists in the usa are n't likely to be more poor or uneducated than the average american . 
  in fact , they were often more educated . 
  lol, 
  you know , things can happen for different reasons . 
  seems somewhat similar ... 
  yeah , colonialism was pretty nice . 
  indeed . 
  most countries are n't forced to act the part though . 
  `` we 're cypriots !!, 
  ! / self determination for cypriots ! '', 
  you can ignore him . 
  notice how he did n't post greek-turkish relations but specifically tayyip 's foreign policy . 
  he has literally been posting nothing but pro-akp posts in / r/turkey for over a year now . 
  every day . 
  dude never seems to sleep .

  meanwhile , the number of unauthorized immigrants from nations other than mexico grew by 325,000 since 2009 , to an estimated 5.3 million in 2014 . 
  populations went up most for unauthorized immigrants from asia and central america , but the number also ticked up for those from sub-saharan africa . 
  increases in the number of unauthorized immigrants from other countries mostly offset the decline in the number from mexico .

  pkk was n't throwing flowers everwhere while taf there . 
  do you remember peace process between turkey and pkk ? 
  pkk promised turkey for leaving from south-east of turkey to north iraq . 
  but pkk did n't keep it 's promise . 
  instead , pkk carried conflicts to cities . 
  deployed weapons , ammunitions during peace process into cities . 
  even captured civilian houses by force , killed jash ( traitor ) kurds , placed ieds under bridges , bulding columns , doors . 
  dug tunnels , burnt buldings . 
  pkk is main reason for destruction of these cities .

  they do n't need turkish armed forces . 
  cutting hand of pro-pkk party in turkey = europe says its persecution of kurds . 
  cutting hand of pro-akp party in netherlands = not persecution , lets cut it . 
  also unlike pkk , akp is not a terrorist organization . 
  democracy please, 
  arrest of terrorist supporters = / = persecuting kurds . 
  support of terrorist supporters = persecuting turkish citizens, 
  which `` terrorist groups ? 
  isis ? 
  2 suicide bombers were ex-pkk member : https://twitter.com/sercannews/status/807974882139054080 [ hdp refused to sign document condemning the attack ] ( https://twitter.com/bilgeoztas/status/807951930517549056 ) https://twitter.com/fgeerdink/status/807847914995380224 https://np.reddit.com/r/terrorist_pkk/comments/4xuf4o/pkkypgkcktakpyd/ the tak who committed suicide bombings in ankara are considered as heroes and glorified by the pyd/ypg in syria . 
  this picture was taken in the syrian town of al-malikiyah . 
  on the flyer we got [ photos of the bombing perpetrators ] ( http://imgur.com/a/t3kyq ) and the pkk founder abdullah \u00f6calan . 
  at the suicide bombing on the busiest bus station of ankara , 30 people came to life and 60 people were seriously injured . 
   i 'm pretty sure it was fake . 
  too many contradictions . 
  contradictions like what ? 
  soldiers, 
  lol . 
  tak claimed responsibility for the attack . 
  coup is not fake but erdogan knew that and turn it to opportunity . 
  good news . 
  supporting terrorism is crime . 
   a police chief accused of grave human rights abuses in the south east and boasting online about kurdish civilians being burned alive in basements was also killed 1 . 
  your sources are pro-pkk . 
  this story is not true and not proven . 
  they were pkk terrrorists , not civilians . 
  turkey wanted them to go outside even sent ambulances but terrorists denied to go outside , resisted . 
  turkish army did n't kill any civilians in south-east of turkey . 
  it 's all black propaganda . 
  calling pkk terrorists as civilians tactic of pkk supporters . 
   davuto\u011flu also said that in sur alone , 11 tons of ammunition piled up by the pkk during the three-year-long peace process ( now collapsed ) with the government have so far been seized . 
  cizre has been a focus of attention recently with its `` ambulance crisis , '' and still no solution has been found to bring medical assistance to people reportedly wounded and stuck in a basement in a pkk-held neighborhood of the town . 
  government officials say it could be a `` trap '' set by the pkk , while the pkk refuses to let the ambulances come closer under military protection and has not transported the wounded to a point which ambulances can reach safely . 
  *  this is because the circle has become tighter and the senior terrorists in this base , where terrorist acts are masterminded to claim hundreds of lives , have been pushed against the wall . 
  they claim that there are not terrorists , but injured civilians in this pkk base and that the hdp 's politicians want ambulances to be deployed around the building to deal with the casualties . 
  however , pkk terrorists in the building are not as moderate as their legal representatives . 
  recently , one of the terrorists who was backed into a corner in the building got through to a television program by phone , saying that their insurgency would continue and they would not `` give in to the ambulances . '', 
  i dont know . 
  he says `` foreign powers '' xd, 
  also `` interest rate lobby '', 
  `` foreign powers wants to destroy us '' `` they want to sabotage our economy '', 
   when 20 % of the population of turkey are kurds you have to be able to find a compromise .

  we do n't . 
  if you were right there would be full-scale civil war . 
  i have kurdish friends . 
  yet we do n't care about pkk-turkey conflicts . 
   but when you do this to a population you know that you 'll get this kind of response . 
  what do you mean ? 
  long time ago bulgarian communist regime oppressed turks even banned turkish language , culture ... but turks did n't attack bulgarian armed forces or bulgarian civilians . 
  even hundred tousands of turkish civilians forced to leave bulgaria yet we did n't attack them again . 
   but many kurds do have a point , what turkey does to kurds okay . 
  you are right . 
  turkey was wrong for banning kurdish language . 
  turkey banned kurdish language because we worried about pkk terrorism . 
  but it was long time ago . 
  can pkk stop now ? 
   according to an official report of the fourth general ispectorate , 13,160 civilians were killed by the turkish army and 11,818 people were taken into exile , depopulating the province . 
  [ 43 ] according to the dersimi , many tribesmen were shot dead after surrendering , and women and children were locked into haysheds which were then set on fire . 
  [ 44 ] according to mcdowall , 40,000 people were killed . 
  [ 1 ] according to kurdish diaspora sources , over 70,000 people were killed . 
  [ 45 ] wikipedia is not a good source , mcdowall worser . 
   fourth general ispectorate so turkish government accepts it 's crime ?

   those are your words , definitely not mine . 
  however mhp does represent the general mind among the turkish population . 
  did you ever been in turkey ? 
   or are you saying that there had been nation wide demonstration agains turkish military 's killing of kurdish civilians ? 
  why would there should be a demonstration for something not happened ? 
  pkk killed civilians beucase they were jash kurds . 
  maybe some people killed by mistakes .

  no , i was replying to ** sanctioning ** us , how about you actually read my comment and its parent before you go off on some rant ? 
  the guy seems to think the e.u can nuke istanbul if we do n't keep the refugees or something . 
   alright i 'll concede the point . 
  if turkish people want to move to europe i 'm super cool with them moving to countries that have somewhat similar cultural background where they would fit in and assimilate into majority culture without any considerable problems . 
  100 % support you guys moving to the balkans if you wish to do so . 
   especially since you got a sphere there and everything . 
  well , i do n't think any turks would move there , especially since its poorer . 
  the only turks moving to europe right now are young liberal turks who are tired of turkey , and this is a very small amount . 
  more people moving the other way , in fact . 
  also , ** we ** do n't have a sphere there , it 's our shared sphere due to byzantine and ottoman empires both having their cores in the southern balkans and anatolia . 
   if you wish to move into other european states that are culturally distinct from your own then i 'd be very picky on who to let in because of same cultural similarity you share with ex-ottoman countries is something that you do not share with norwegians for example . 
  you will stand out and you will stand out hard as a foreigner and as a muslims . 
  it 's double whammy basically so people who are let in need to be vetted in as being the `` right type '' of people . 
  usually well educated , secular and who want to come into these countries to make a better life and leave the past one with majority of their culture behind . 
  right , if you 're vetting people for the right values and high education , you need to do the same for everyone . 
  and most east europeans would probably not be even let in to the country , considering how racist they are . 
  the ones that are n't are fine . 
    i 'm not for kicking anyone . 
  what 's done is done . 
  but i do think that eu got bloated to fast and my eu would most likely be at least 4-6 countries lighter than it is today . 
  was n't even the point i was making . 
  start reading and replying to actual points instead of strawmanning shit . 
  i 'm talking within context of imigration . 
  the whole discussion is in context of imigration because turkey within eu makes as much sense as russia within nato . 
  so from perspective of imigration . 
  imigration . 
  eu was formed to shield against turkey ? 
  i know europe hates us but let 's not get too extreme here . 
  i have no idea what `` imigration '' is , perhaps you meant immigration ? 
  two m 's . 
   from perspective of imigration being a nationalistic venomous shit outside of your borders is a shitter behavior . 
  if you wave the crecent flag , if you talk shit about the country you are currently living in and praise the erdo land while living outside of turkey like in scandinavia you are being a shitter . 
  unless it is in a cultural context for the lol 's , like irish americans in the u.s or something . 
  otherwise , well yeah you 're being shitty , duh . 
   if you are being nationalistic within borders of your own country then you 're not really doing anything out of line , no ? 
  i do n't need to agree with the religious angle or occasional racism but maybe to you being proud of your country and waving the flag of your nation is something to be shunned and rediculed right but to me it 's just healthy nationalism . 
  nationalism is never healthy , do n't confuse it with patriotism . 
  nationalism is about your culture , race and people , it leads to hatred and genocide . 
  patriotism is pride of your country , and everyone in it ( including immigrants ) . 
   i also do n't care how you rate eastern europe since i do n't live there nor care about it beyond occassional argument from position of better knowlage through language and culture . 
  good for you , really . 
   technically russia is part of `` europe '' and i still do n't consider it as european nation . 
  would n't want it part of eu either . 
  would vet people who want to imigrate out of there more rigurously likewise . 
  that 's your problem mate , they are part of europe whether you want it or not . 
  you ca n't just decide they are uneuropean because they occupied your country , lol . 
   yes i 'm liberal minded . 
  in that i do n't consider skin color and ethnic background of a person as really important factors . 
  culture on the other hand , ideology they have and religious upbringing are of paramount importance . 
  i 'm for equality under law within national borders and for almost complete freedom of speech . 
  this is why i 'm so dead set on having imigration being more rigurous . 
  because once you let people in by law you ca n't prevent and should n't prevent them from being complete intollerable pain in the ass or downright subversive elements within society . 
  i view that same society should strive to help people within it who are truly in need or who life has dealt bad cards . 
  i do n't think it should be super strict though , just make sure they are n't racists/bigots or have a problem with people 's religions or beliefs , and they wo n't cause any trouble . 
  also no way you 're liberal . 
  maybe in saudi arabia you would be liberal . 
   sounds about alt right to you ? . 
  sounds right-wing for sure , i do n't know your exact positions , but it could be normal or you could be a bigot . 
  clearly you do n't know much about turkey though , yet you are filled with opinions about us . 
   also the point about blue eyed thing was that i could probably pass for a local while being from elsewhere but i still stand out in mannerism , in thought process and approach to problem solving from a local . 
  someone from even more distinctive cultural background will stand out twice as much . 
  hair color , eye color has nothing to do with it . 
  i can definitely tell when someone is slavic/east european . 
  you seem to be an okay guy , but most east europeans ( especially hungarians ) would n't fit in the west , considering their rampant racism . 
  in fact , russians are better in that regard , even if it 's really bad . 
   in what ways you say . 
  not willing to work while being hired through quotas because it 's a womans job . 
  not willing to do something because they feel like they 're better than a local who slaves at the same job . 
  being culturally exclusive to own little circle of ideologically and religiously similar kind with intent of building a piece of homeland in another populations lands that allow them to stay . 
  how is this applicable to turks ? 
  i mean yeah , the turks in europe are from eastern turkey , which might aswell be the middle east , with less sharia , but on what grounds do you accuse turks of thinking they 're better than germans ? 
  some probably do , but alot more germans think they 're better than us . 
  i do n't think german turks want to form their own country within germany either . 
  where in ee you from btw ? 
  edit : didi n't see a part lol . 
  why not ? 
  because some ( or most , depending on the definition ) muslims are white . 
  sanction us for what exactly ? 
  there is no basis in international law for forcing us to take refugees . 
  we , unlike eu countries , have no legal obligation to take refugees since we didi n't sign anything . 
   its like asking the turks to give anatolia back to greeks , turks = turkified ( byzantine ) anatolians . 
  so that does n't even make sense since anatolia was hellenized but never truly greek . 
  muslims ca n't be genocided !, 
  downvoted and blocked . 
  did you really just use white to refer to non-muslim ? 
  you mean kurds ? 
   turkey is not europe , rip eastern thrace . 
   the problem with that is it places the responsibility solely on europeans , still . 
  which is the mentality we need to break who is placing the responsibility on europeans ? 
  it 's the government that is expected to solve problems in society , not individuals . 
  how the hell is this relevant ? 
  i do n't want to kick out all foreigners but i do n't want them living in my freaking home either . 
  why should they believe there is an added risk of harm to themselves ? 
  is n't it called masis in armenian ? 
   at no point did i state that it 's incompatible . 
  it 's got it 's cultural and religious differences that make it distinctively more different and less compatible with european states . 
  but it 's not incompatible . 
  just meens that there needs to be more vigilance about who gets to come in . 
  again with these `` european states '' . 
  ex-ottoman countries are much closer to turkey culturally than to iceland .

  i do not know . 
  but its pronunciation is good . 
  yes , but people who do not like him call him as tayyip . 
  finally , foreigners call him as tayyip , not erdogan . 
  till negotiations are canceled . 
  no , he does not want . 
  he just uses populism and majority of population does not want to join eu . 
  why does crete have terrorists ? 
  do they want seperation ? 
  east thrace and \u0130zmir ( smyrna ) are most secular part of turkey . 
  nobody can take them . 
  probably they will massacre in courthouse or take hostages . 
  bad fish recipes ?!,

  the chief public prosecutor of the supreme court of appeals initially used `` akp '' , but after an objection from the party , `` akp '' was replaced with `` adalet ve kalk\u0131nma partisi '' ( without abbreviation ) in documents .

  please , do n't drink vodka while navigating a ship .

  i think when merkel said `` yeah sure , we 'll go back to the talks on ascension process and all that bullshit '' she expected the turks to buy it and germans to see through the rhetoric . 
  the complete inverse of that happened lol . 
  no she does n't . 
  we do n't buy that either . 
  but some people selectively accept the bullshit that confirms their bias . 
  oh , completely normal then . 
  everyone spies on everyone . 
  this `` us spies on us !, 
  it 's germany ! '',

  what people should be outraged about is when governments begin to spy on their own people . 
  although this is something every government does on some level too i guess .

  when did european ideals decided to take a hike and people turned into the monsters they used to despise so much ? 
  i 'm 6 ' 2-ish ( that 's 1.87 to everyone here lol ) and i weigh 78 kgs , and i look a bit round on the belly area . 
   the idea that weighing more than 80kg for either a man or a woman is healthy . 
  if you 're 95kg you have to be either a very tall and strong man or you 're simply obese . 
  the idea that fat/large people are `` normal '' and do n't have a very troubling , dangerous health issue is totally alien here . 
  note that there is usually no `` digust '' or fat-shaming or fat-hating , but rather a deep feeling of sincere concern/worry for the health of the fat person . 
  i think this is connected to extreme political correctness thing they got over there . 
  add that to your list too .

  who wants to fight superpowers ' proxy wars ? 
  anyone ? 
  real life does n't work like a strategy video game or a hollywood rebel movie , sadly . 
  well , they do n't like working like a slave and sleeping on streets i think . 
  dunno about iran and china . 
  yurop is one giant utopia to them so they just flock over there . 
  also , surprise surprise , we do n't want any more refugees either . 
  they kill the labor market by working illegally . 
  we got 2.2 millions and that 's enough . 
  turkey and lebanon alone could double the amount of refugees whole eu has . 
  you guys actually get a minority of refugees really . 
  but ca n't even deal with that apparently lol . 
  oh , high and mighty eu riding the moral high horse , oh , when did we get here ? 
  when you are out of your country 's borders , you speak english .

  man , y' all really have a twisted perception of us do n't ya ? 
  we just shoot people in the head . 
  beheading is so 90s . 
  we even have national holidays where the country just turns into a big free-for-all heretic and heathen shooting match . 
  ** edit ** : the deleted comment was saying people are gon na get beheaded because of this or something . 
  people think of us like monsters lmao . 
  i mean it 's been a long while since i behead someone , really . 
  it was last tuesday i think . 
  kinda feels like a d&d universe . 
   i have to walk 1 hour to the centre you found that entertaining as someone completely stranger to the area but when you have to spend hours on public transportation and walking just to get to somewhere , and deal with that neverending traffic , it becomes exhausting . 
  i remember that once it took me 4 hours to get somewhere . 
  i could switch 3 cities in 4 hours in germany . 
   you can find everything and anything for sale on the shelf and its cheap if you haggle . 
  or visit a real shop and its cheap well , it 's not cheap for us . 
  with one euro worth three liras , most foreigners find it very cheap . 
  but it 's very expensive to live in \u0130stanbul with a lira wage . 
  even with only your apartment rent you can end up starving come end of the month . 
   i remember where a knowledgeable imam patiently answered questions by some westerners trying very hard to convert him to atheism ( for over an hour ! ) . 
  was fun to watch , i asked him a few questions too . 
  this is interesting . 
  did they talk in english ? 
  what did they talk about ? 
  why the hell did you go to cizre and diyarbak\u0131r ? 
  be glad that you managed to get away with only getting robbed . 
  \u0130stanbul can be kinda cool but live here for a few years and the magic comes off easily .

  akp upped their vote percentage by 10 in mere months thanks to several bombings and propaganda .

islamic fasting is no food or water from sunrise to sunset , for one month . 
  this year it was 16 hours per day . 
  this sounds very unhealthy , especially the no water part . 
  source : i live in a muslim country . 
  ( modern ? ), 
  catholic ( or was it protestant ) fasting is very simple . 
  you decide not to eat some things ( the example i was told was french fries ) and you keep it during the fasting period . 
  source : a german girl ( greek ? ), 
  orthodox fasting is the best in my opinion . 
  there are various levels with meat being forbidden and you choose if you eat diary products and eggs . 
  strict fasting means no oil too . 
  but some seafood is allowed , like octapus and mushels . 
  there is a 49 day fasting and you also fast two days per week . 
  source : a greek guy, 
  does your wife have a beard ? 
  it was a real coup attempt that failed . 
  they do it all the time . 
  my guess is they didnt know that they were lying , but they really dont care . 
  they decided to vilify g\u00fclenists , discredit all opposition and praise erdo\u011fan with anything , true or not . 
  that was real too . 
  the germans/westerners are jealous of us and/or they hate us . 
  they dont want turkey to advance . 
  many turks seriously believe ( after politicians told them ) that the gezi protests in 2013 were organized by germany/lufthansa/claudia roth because of the third \u0130stanbul airport and/or the third bridge . 
  if you understand our mindset , you can easily explain everything . 
   it 's interesting how low support for israel though . 
  israel is not exactly in europe , i guess that 's the main reason .

  there are no other generals . 
  the turkish army had a total of 358 , more than 157 were discharged . 
  http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/infographics-turkeys-coup-attempt-in-numbers.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=102228&amp;newscatid=341 ( numbers are higher now since more generals were discharge or arrested ) special forces ( sat komandosu ) were decimated , almost all are arrested or fugitive . 
  many aircrafts were bombed ( we dont know how many , but according to descriptions it might be a three digit number ), 
  more than 213 pilots were discharge or arrested . 
  that 's a very odd way to calculate it . 
  more than 157 out of 358 generals were suspended , most of them arrested . 
  that 's 44 % of the generals in the turkish army . 
  you included the conscripts to come to that number , this is kinda misleading . 
  for a visitor , it is as great as it was 5 years ago . 
  i find your comment out-of-place but you dont deserve so many downvotes . 
  accept a virtual brofist . 
  this is true and many of us fail to recognize it . 
  g\u00fclenists were much more educated than the average conservative muslim turk . 
  yes , thats a risk . 
  70000 educated , previously well connected , disenfranchised people are dangerous . 
  i hope that , after cleaning up the state apparatous , he will provide will be some sort of amnesty and try to take the majority of these people with his side . 
  not all of them are putschists , most are just conservative religious members of an islamic cult .

  there was a state of emergency for decades in the kurdish parts of turkey .

  maybe thats why he hesitated , and he only decided so when he saw it was necessairy . 
  funny comment in / r/turkey : did we all become kurds now ? 
  i obviously agree , but state of emergency ( the type declared today ) is not that bad .

  we have three different types of states of emergency . 
  in the one declared now , the police can search you but not your property without warrant . 
  the detention period can become indefinite , but this should be voted by the parliament . 
  im just parotting what lawyers say on tv . 
  these 50000 were not arrests , they were suspensions of public servants . 
  there were a couple thousand detentions and arrests .

  the matheo solution eli5,

  i have to disagree . 
  / r/europe is one of the least hostile subreddits against turkey . 
  what is it 's meaning then ? 
  just admit that you 're wrong already . 
  that 's literally the definition of a democracy , whether you like it or not . 
  definition of democracy : government by the people ; especially : rule of the majority . 
  okay then let me tell you that the things you mentioned have nothing to do with secularism and democracy . 
  what does any of that have to do with secularism/democracy ? 
  makes total sense to stab the person you sleep with , right ? 
  check the sidebar . 
  turkey is part of the european countries . 
  if you 're going to argue against that , talk to the mods , this is n't the place to discuss this , especially under such a tragic thread . 
  no better time to go then . 
  security is at a maximum level right now . 
  secularism * and you 're wrong . 
  the government literally said they suspected isis was behind this . 
  well , you were n't wrong . 
  only recently an isis attack in london was foiled . 
  it was broadcasted on cnn t\u00fcrk and habert\u00fcrk ( and probably others ) . 
  i agree . 
  such attacks are n't / were n't exactly commonplace in turkey . 
  turkey should at least be yellow imo . 
  nothing personal to you , it 's just that in the past few days i saw people not capitalize `` turks '' but capitalize other nationalities such as `` germans '' , thought it was an attempt at insulting . 
  maybe i 'm just looking to get offended though . 
  by the way , my grandparents are from bulgaria , and what they usually say is in line with what you 're saying . 
  obviously there 's a reason why they do n't live in bulgaria anymore , but i feel like our culture is similar in a lot of ways and that probably helps with the turkish people in bulgaria being integrated into society . 
  so for example , you would n't say english but you would say english ? 
  that 's quite interesting . 
  do n't know why people never capitalize the t in turks . 
  did i ever say i do n't recognize it ? 
   what i know about turkey : country full of muslims . 
  contrary to popular believe , turkey has a huge population of non-muslims . 
  there are more than 400 + active churches in turkey and there are millions of no-religion ( atheist , agnostic etc. ), 
  people . 
  http://atheistcensus.com/ turkey has its own beer companies ( efes pilsen , one of the biggest in the region ) and produces some of the best wine in the world . 
  turkey also has an extremely strong alcoholic drink called rak\u0131 ( 60 % + alcohol ) , it is considered to be the national drink by many . 
  but i get why you 'd think that way . 
  it 's easy to be mislead , but now you know better , 
  well ottoman empire = / = turkey , and i refuse to be held guilty for things some uncivilized fuck did a century ago . 
  it was n't exclusively turkish people who instigated such attacks , the times were just terrible and basically all groups in the region had beef with another . 
  yes , terrible things did happen , i recognize all the lives taken during that period and i sincerely wish this would 've been avoided , but i wo n't accept being held accountable for all those hideous crimes , and pretend as if you guys are innocent here , as though your people have n't committed massacres and i wo n't accept that we , turkish people , are being depicted as the devil all the time . 
  i do accept that the ottoman empire has done atrocious things , but i also expect you to accept that your previous empires have done terrible things too . 
   i have never once in my life heard a turk say ` yeah it happened and it was bad ' . 
  well , i 've never seen a greek person accept the genocide against turkish people . 
   i do n't think for a second that a turk in 2016 should feel guilty or ashamed for what happened 100 years ago thank you . 
  that goes for you too . 
   but to deny these things happened and get away with it is madness . 
  i do n't think anyone really denies that people have been killed , people mostly deny it was a genocide , a deliberate ethnic cleansing . 
  to me , it does n't really matter what you call it , it was certainly not the right thing to do but as you are aware we 're not able to change the past . 
  so you think turkish military targets kurdish civilians , aiming to wipe them out ? 
  do you even realize there are 15 million kurds in turkey , most of which are entirely part of turkish society ? 
  i did n't downvote you , but we 're just wondering what made you think turkish people would n't drink wine . 
  it 's not a crime to ask but you should know it 's not pleasant for us to face all these incorrect stereotypes . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims sorry what ? 
  do n't forget the suicide bombers . 
  very peaceful method of dealing with stuff . 
  what are you basing this comment on ? 
   we have our own problems to deal with . 
  we have much bigger problems , and yet we took in 3 million refugees . 
  now good for us , right , but no . 
  we 're sort of obligated to take them and since the rest of the world demonizes turkey as much as they can , refusing refugees would even create more hatred against us . 
  you 're in the lucky situation of whining about a few thousand refugees . 
  honestly , i think 35,000 refugees is the least you can do . 
   and syrians represent like 5 % of the refugees we have . 
  most of them are iraqis on some europe sight-seeing tour , plenty of them have already left because this is n't a wonderland after all . 
  the 5 % is probably a hyperbole , cause otherwise you would be claiming that there are 700,000 refugees in finland . 
  i have no idea how many iraqi refugees there really are , but if it 's indeed a lot then that 's fair enough . 
   add rapes committed by them , constant fighting in the refugee centers , and lots of whining on their part . 
  do n't know about the situation in finland so it 's not my place to talk . 
  though i must add that i 've been to finland several times ( my mother side has finnish ancestors ) and i 've barely seen any immigrants/refugees . 
  but again , i do n't know about the crime statistics so maybe you 're right . 
  according to the un charters , which by the way almost all member nations have signed , every nation that is secure and safe is obligated to take refugees . 
  what harm would a couple thousand refugees do to you ? 
  just asking for your opinion : do you think that 's a lot ? 
  i did n't claim it was 12 . 
  but yeah i do n't get why out of all countries , it 's the finnish who whine the most . 
  in turkey we have 3 million refugees and rarely any of us whine . 
  well , 32,000 is n't really that much at all , in my opinion . 
  that 's like 0.7 % of your population . 
  you have a very small number of refugees , even though it may not be as small as 1050 . 
  well , your article says  finland is unused to mass immigration . 
  it has registered 18,400 asylum seekers this year , compared with 3,600 in all of 2014 . 
  so the large numbers are probably not true ( yet ) . 
  http://i.imgur.com/byv5thn.png i think you 're bullshitting . 
   ( yes , i call them migrants , not refugees ) jesus christ tough guy , take it easy  now we are paying the price remind me how many refugees does finland host again ? 
   since you 're turkish i 'll make a comparison between the two countries . 
  why would you make a comparison between my country and yours ? 
  i never claimed turkey is a strong country . 
   the oecd website says : `` gdp growth is expected to rise to 1.4 % in 2016 and 2017 . 
  the labour market is improving , helping to drive private consumption higher . '', 
  together with a general improvement of the eu 's economy i guess our you statement is absolutely rubbish . 
  my statement is absolutely rubbish ? 
  you 're citing a source that says gdp in italy is going to rise , do you really think that 's somehow proof that italy is performing well economically ? 
  that 's an absolute joke . 
  http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21679251-government-tries-relieve-banks-non-performing-loans-burden-sharing?zid=295&amp;ah=0bca374e65f2354d553956ea65f756e0 read this . 
  your banks and thereby your country has massive debts , and the loans given to banks are underperforming i.e. 
  they 're not making profits . 
  especially this part underlines how bad the situation is : `` the burden of non-performing loans ( npls ) in italy is now immense : they amount to $ 350 billion ( $ 370 billion ) , the equivalent of 21 % of gdp . '', 
  your unemployment rate is quite high ( though admittedly it could be worse ) and income inequality is increasing . 
   again , at this point we 're the 8th biggest economy in the world , meaning that there are more than a hundred countries that are not as strong as we are , which is not bad imo .

  as for other asians , not really that much . 
  there are a few from korea and japan though , not sure why . 
  in a turkey people would be mostly curious . 
  lol , that could easily be turkey , just not any warm coast . 
  in fact , you ca n't really exclude any of those areas except for perhaps taiwan , malaysia and thailand .

  nah , unless we traded izmir and balikesir for west thrace and crete before the exchange . 
  too late for that now . 
  how dare thee suggest that i were to name my firstborn after a lowly mortal name instead of our glorious eternal leader mandated by the heavens !! 1 ?

  i would n't want actual federalism , i do n't it 's needed at all . 
  get on our level, 
  does cyprus count ? 
  hue, 
  turkey is european , so i assume you mean turks in the west ? 
  they are the descendants of really poor farmers , and very very insular , only making friends with other turks etc. 
  but not at all like most muslim immigrants . 
  is he iranian ? 
  if so then he 's very likely identifiably brown . 
  even other europeans get beat up in countries like poland for being `` arab '' . 
  sounds a bit compulsive ? 
  talk to a doctor, 
  once every two days , my showers are really long too . 
  why would you go around making statements like that unless you 're a nut bag trying to stir up trouble ? 
  if r/europe is a place you need to hide your right wing beliefs in , then honestly you 're extra far-right . 
  such as ? 
  lol , iranians are usually browner than both turks , syrians , yugos etc , so you will stick out even more than the typical immigrants . 
  but i do n't think racism is actually that much of a problem in western europe . 
  all of it , except maybe west coast . 
  i like thracian accent . 
  and the best in the world would have to be west country english . 
  uh , maybe not all of it , and it 's too late for that now . 
  we coulda kept the rest of thrace and greece could have kept izmir . 
  yes . 
  i 'm not sure how your statement applies to modern day turkey . 
  time for russian independance in estonia then . 
  yup , that 's the best a country like russia can expect . 
  clusterfuck then romans then clusterfuck then we did then clusterfuck then communism then clusterfuck, 
  turks also have massive foreign ancestry , so seeing people saying that their parents were from bulgaria/caucasus/albania is n't very rare . 
  while i am almost entirely of balkan heritage , it does n't magically make me less turkish . 
  and i do n't see myself as anything other than an anatolian . 
  as for children with a foreign parent , it really depends on which nationality the foreign parent has and whether or not the person in question is `` muslim '' . 
  i do n't have a problem with anyone identifiying as turkish , one drop rule does n't exist here either . 
  did we kill you ? 
  no , it 's just your regular friendly neighbourhood imperialism . 
  i do n't know if the nordics want to fuck/marry you ... 
  but it 's okay , kill your only nato friend . 
  that 's your problem .

  that we 're middle eastern lol, 
  balkans was considered near east before though . 
  more like christian countries became europe and muslim ones `` middle east '' , since there was no better term . 
  wow , i hope there are no turks in italy then . 
  hmm , so iran , cyprus , caucasus and turkey are all called arabia aswell ? 
  i do n't think anybody considers afghanistan or pakistan as part of the middle east outside of america .

  then we would colonize the americas and cause massive inflation in anatolia with aztec and inca gold . 
  at least thats what i always do in eu4 . 
  you 're right , i should have said independent theater or whatever . 
  i guess the point i was trying to make is that you are n't that likely to encounter it at the mall and will have to go a bit out of your way to see a french or italian film and really it 's the same at least in germany and here . 
  kind of missed an opportunity not having it be czechoslovakia . 
  also if the czech republic is looking for a name why not call itself czechoslovakia . 
  not in the sense that they make any claim on slovakia but just like they are the czech part of slovakia . 
  that way i wont be wrong anymore when i forget and say czechoslocakia instead of czech republic or czechia . 
  alternatively , they could rename the country czechoslovenia just to confuse everybody . 
   the average european does actually . 
  i mean look at movies like hot fuzz , mustang and intouchables . 
  i do n't think hot fuzz counts , it 's in english and plenty of americans have seen it . 
  but what makes you think you are average ? 
  if you look at [ last weeks box office receipts in france ] ( http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/france/?yr=2017&amp;wk=31&amp;p=.htm ) you will see that the best selling 7 films are from the anglosphere , the 8th in french and you have to go all the way down to number 16 to get something in spanish . 
  [ the germans ] ( http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/germany/?yr=2017&amp;wk=31&amp;p=.htm ) watched more of their own stuff last weekend , but they did n't watch any non english foreign language films at all . 
  the average european just watches hollywood and some local stuff . 
  america is not different , it 's just that hollywood is the local stuff . 
  of course in big cities like new york , chicago , san fransisco , los angeles , etc. . you will find theaters that only show foreign language films with subtitles . 
  you might also find such theaters in smaller towns that have important universities . 
  but the average working stiff does n't want to spend his hard earned recreational time reading subtitles and missing the action on the screen . 
  this is why the people in the suburbs of paris and the vast majority of germans prefer dubbing . 
  it just is n't as fun and relaxing to read subtitles as it is to watch a film in a language you understand . 
  now since the hollywood is the local stuff in the us , there really is n't much money to be made in the dubbing industry , what exactly would they dub ? 
  it 's mostly just kung fu movies and really popular classic foreign films that get dubbed eventually . 
   also most of them do n't seem to speak a lot of foreign languages . 
  this is more or less true . 
   from an experience point of view : most americans i 've met in my life are not interested in foreign movies . 
  the market for english films is much bigger than for any other european language . 
  this means that if you have the skills required to make a movie , you will make more money if you make it in english . 
  as a result the majority of money and talent ends up in hollywood . 
  the result is that the vast majority of foreign language films viewed by europeans are in fact american . 
  not only that 65 % of all movies watched in europe are american . 
  why would you expect the average american to watch the low budget dramas and comedies that europe produces when the average european does n't ? 
  if an exceptional film is produced by europeans , it is watched by other europeans as well as americans . 
  it does n't happen that often given how fractured the markets are . 
  otherwise people watch films in their own language and american films . 
  saying you watch foreign films is really usually just virtue signaling . 
  most people have watched maybe three or four films that are n't in their native language or english but then they pretend they do it all the time . 
  it 's only a small minority wherever you go who does so regularly . 
   do the us have theaters that shown foreign movies undubbed ? 
  it 's a country of 320 million people that occupies a third of a continent and contains at least half a dozen world class cities . 
  what do you think ? 
  do you honestly think that there is even the slightest chance there are n't foreign language theaters in new york or san fransisco ? 
  well if you make more than $ 35k then you are the 1 % globally by income . 
  you need about $ 800k in net worth to qualify in terms of accumulated wealth . 
  i think half of all western and northern europeans qualify for the first . 
  the second is more difficult though , most people own only their home , their car and not many homes are 700k . 
  savage, 
  this is of course if you are talking about movable type . 
  it 's not at all clear who invented wood block printing , though the chinese are the strongest candidate for this too . 
  but stamps and seals have been around forever . 
  really , i think , it would have been invented anywhere where the literacy rate was high enough to create a sufficient demand for books . 
  from an army with a state to a company with a state , eh ? 
  or just a bit of wood . 
  i thought the queen was german . 
   people joke the biggest kurdish city on earth is istanbul it 's not really a joke . 
  obviously it 's not a kurdish city since they are n't a majority but the city is big and a low ball estimate of 10 % would put them at 1.5 million , which is more than the population of any majority kurdish city . 
  am i even european ? 
  / grabs popcorn , hides in bushes . 
  come on , man . 
  i 've had a rough night and i really hate the eagles . 
  oh yeah , that is true . 
  also often the sycophants will have an area cleared before a dear leader or other high level functionary who actually thinks this sort of shit works shows up . 
   some countries ban satellite devices for this reason yes but this is really hard to enforce . 
  saddam did it , iran still does it , but still the vast majority of people have satellite dishes . 
  it 's a form of prohibition , it does n't work . 
  there are n't enough rooms in prison . 
  it just creates more corruption . 
  currently satellite internet is pretty expensive compared to a land line . 
  if spacex or some other company can bring down launch costs , then we might see increased competition and lower prices . 
  i thought trickle down economics was an american thing . 
   but we also have a flag !, 
  but do you have a four dimensional hyperfleg ? 
  i do n't know how she would have done at the job , but she was an absolute trainwreck of a campaigner . 
  the media hyped her debating skills but she basically just conceded the nafta point . 
  and keeping bill away from the campaign ? 
  why ? 
  he was an excelent campaigner , a lot of people liked him and the ones that did n't were n't going to vote for her anyway . 
  it did n't hurt obama at all when he showed up for him . 
  did she forget that us elections are about exciting the base and getting a better turnout ? 
  it 's almost as if she did n't want to win . 
  at that size it looks a lot like an upside down bosnian flag . 
  now i assume it was a tk tr type mixup . 
  not even just muslims .

  you picked the two most uneuropean things about us . 
   we can be good neighbours , though . 
  you and me do n't decide that , if all europeans were like you we 'd be in war . 
  beside , he told the muslim world . 
  yeah , erdogan is probably not pro-eu . 
  but it 's hard to sell leaving the muslim world for europe if we might get rejected at the door , so there is very little support for the eu in turkey . 
  well , this will be awkward in the future . 
  if you have a hard time understanding , this would be like us openly declaring that the terror attack in belgium was an `` armed struggle '' and not terrorism . 
  i do n't think this is legit though . 
  both is happening . 
  ignorance on both sides . 
  what would be the justification to permaban turkey from the eu ? 
  you 're right . 
  most pkk members are kurds from turkey . 
  you are literally deranged , you will never accept any position other than your own . 
  it 's either me who edited something or erdogan 's propaganda to you . 
  conveniently you ignored * google * also placing turkey as the center of landmasses . 
  jesus you 're humiliating yourself so hard . 
  edit : noticed you called hurriyet `` akp-controlled '' ahahahaahahaahahah , i guess i 'm under akp control too then ? 
  like everyone who tries to break your bubble of illusion . 
  we 're as european as we 're west asian , that will never change . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i didi n't edit shit . 
  [ even google has marked turkey as the geographical center . 
  ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/google-marks-turkeys-corum-as-center-of-the-earth.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=100514&amp;newscatid=341 )  a new calculation made via a global digital surface model by holger isenberg in 2003 adjusted the center and marked \u00c7orum province as the world 's geographical center . 
  try again , without the cognitive dissonance . 
  edit : also nice downvote , helps you recover from the humiliation this exchange has been for you . 
  i thought you meant kebabrepublik nordturkei , but that too . 
  cool stuff . 
  god , you 're a slow one . 
  i 'll quote it for you . 
   in 1973 , andrew j. 
  woods , a physicist with gulf energy & environmental systems in san diego , used a digital global map and calculated the coordinates on a mainframe system as 39 \u00b0 00 \u2032 n 34 \u00b0 00 \u2032 e , in modern turkey , 1,000 km north of giza [ 7 ] [ unreliable source ? ], 
  go to the toilet already , you 're so constipated . 
  constipated comment above . 
  center as in * geographical * center , like i stated above . 
  istanbul is n't a turkish name , but sure . 
   i do n't know why some turkish men are offended when someone use constantinople . 
  more like alt-righters spamming `` constantinople '' as if anyone cares . 
  chomarr is how i pronounce it . 
  our white thrash . 
  so you like the name copenhagen ? 
  how do you feel about english names being used on danish cities ? 
  muslim country = bad at doing stuffs probably his logic . 
  sounds like you ran into a comar . 
  i 'm so sorry . 
  fuck it , let 's just move to space . 
  how is that relevant ? 
  feel betrayed that someone who expected to share your values is actually not a frothing bigot ? 
  omg , all this time we 've been trying to get erdogan the * person * to join the eu ? 
  not our country ? 
  it was named constantinople at the time , 
  turkey actually * is * the geographic center of all the land in the world ( so not including oceans ) . 
  edit : downvoted for a neutral fact ? 
  your english is making my eyes bleed . 
  you 're just changing the goalposts constantly , please stop replying . 
  let it all out people . 
  interesting , you changed what we are talking about as you realized i was right . 
  huh . 
  well , the same thing still stands , if we are n't european , then byzantines are n't european . 
   same can be said about you i 'm not the extremely ignorant one . 
   no displacing happens in the example , just switch in rulling . 
  are you saying turkey is ruled by non-anatolians ? 
  what relevance does this even have ? 
   ethnically yes - they are turks , nationality wise - most likely not , at this point we can speak of a new nation . 
  ethnic group is what we 're discussing . 
   to sum up again - yes turkic people lived in the are of byzantine , no they didi n't , only a very small amount . 
   but there 's no continuation between the byzantine and ottoman/turkey , they are in two separate brackets there is no statewise continuation between turkey and the ottomans , but the ottoman dynasty descended partially from a byzantine ruling dynasty , and part of the sultan 's title was `` ceasar of rome '' . 
  but this is all irrelevant , we are speaking of the ethnic group of the people . 
  source on ancient greeks being lighter skinned than todays greeks ? 
  beside , central asians were n't particularly dark themselves , probably lighter than the average anatolian . 
  you really do n't get things do you ? 
  polish education ...  had kurds gained power and took control over area that is today turkey and created a new state , would you call them turkish ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  what kind of example is this ? 
  your example is an ethnic group * displacing * another . 
  that 's not what happened . 
  i 'll use a more accurate example . 
  imagine if a small group of americans moved into turkey and conquered it , 900 years later all turks spoke english and identified as americans . 
  would you not call the above americanized turks ? 
  tired of saying this , but current populations did not `` arrive '' anywhere . 
  the people of anatolia were turkified by a small invasion force , most turks descend from the same people who lived here during homer 's time . 
  you guys never get a break . 
   you equated different people groups with each other `` people groups '' are bound together by descent  you got extremally wide understanding of `` the same people '' . 
  once hellenized or turkified or whatever else it 's not longer the same people group and why is it no longer the same `` people group '' ? 
  are the french not gallic ? 
   compelete change of law , culture , religion , traditions this is patently false . 
  yes the religion changed but most of the old traditions lived on in an islamified form and were shaped into what we know today as turkish culture . 
  do you actually know ** anything ** about us or are you just pulling shit out of your ass ? 
  regardless , the argument was sparked by you spilling bullshit bile and calling us `` invaders '' while we are literally the same people who have always lived here . 
  you 're going down with the ship !, 
   this is wrong . 
  you confuse nationalities , `` race '' / language group and local groups . 
  i do n't even understand what this sentance means ? 
  what am i confusing ? 
  we are hellenized and then turkified , still the same people for that . 
   turkey/ottoman empire are not successor states of byzantine empire i 'd love to see your statement backed up atleast one argument . 
  therefore turks = ottomans , byzantines , anatolians . 
  you claimed we were invaders while we are actually the natives . 
  how does that not conflict ?

  i didnt notice that , but still stupid comparison in my opinion . 
  greece , calm down . 
  why would anyone assume that people in europe know the flags of american states ? 
  well not everything has to be like in the west . 
  however 30 months seems exessive , but i guess thats akp and akps judges way of trying to show : hey see we respect atat\u00fcrk too . 
  masallah . 
  sorry , we dont have tea from the tap . 
  i will report you to tayyip himself . 
  i mean you 're usually offered tea for free everywhere , like when you 're in a shop buying shoes or after dinner . 
  you paid for cay ? 
  never been a fan of turkish coffee tbh . 
  we do drink black tea mostly . 
   uk : tea 3.5 kg are you even trying ? 
  edit : wait till you see how much bread we consume . 
  so original , remove kebab . 
  we dont need her to win , just to take votes away from erdogan would be sufficient . 
  when i posted this last week it was removed , could have been a karma millionaire now . 
  it 's so repetitive .

  thats easy , all of that should be turkish ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  welcome aboard . 
  i guess if you live in eastern germany its the next best thing , whereas you have a couple of dozen cities to choose from if you 're from lets say nrw . 
  worth mentioning that a lot of people are moving to the big cities in germany and the rural population is declining . 
  it 's real . 
  in cologne . 
  so leipzig is a boomtown ? 
  first time i 'm hearing that . 
  i doubt that they are even close to the levels of rent you have to pay in cologne , d\u00fcsseldorf or stuttgart . 
  at least build something like this : http://www.koeln.de/files/images/urinal_800.zoom.jpg, 
  holy submission history . 
  there are lgbt akp supporter groups too : http://www.gabile.com/resim/haber/2108.jpg, 
  what you said in first post is wrong and insulting . 
  you cant just make a stupid statement like that and expect no one to complain . 
  at least think for a second before you make such a stupid , dumb post . 
  i 'm seriously angry at work right now . 
  u/ontyyy please show me a transgender singer sitting with a conservative politician in eastern european czech republic . 
  you are a moron . 
  you said in countries where the people are muslim they would be thrown from a roof . 
  guess what people are muslim in the countries i counted but they are not living under islamic law . 
  thats how wrong you are and ignorant . 
  its wrong , its ignorant , its stupid . 
  you have probably never been to a single country you just degraded . 
  you should leave the house once for a while or at least get out of your echo chamber . 
  your comment is pretty insulting . 
  who the fuck was thrown down a roof in turkey , bosnia , albania for example ? 
  i cant believe that something stupid like this is upvoted in here . 
  there are plenty of gay muslims in turkey or lebanon etc. 
  is this the same party that tries to remove the pkk from the eus terror list ? 
  thanks . 
  can you link me to it ? 
  why was it `` bombarded '' ? 
  there are more than 3 hours left and yesterdays march had up to 300k people joining it . 
  plenty of time left . 
  how may people have been killed thus far by the police ? 
  you can argue as much as you want about it but its derailing the comment sections every time . 
  gezi was a peaceful protest that turned violent because the police burned tents , pepper sprayed and tear gassed everyone . 
  you might remember the girl in the red dress ? 
  they were reading books to the police when the police decided to pepper spay them . 
  its clear who was at fault for the violence that followed . 
  https://adnanramin.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/istanbul-red1.jpg 7 people have been killed by the police . 
  one kid was hid with a tear gas canister in the end while he was buying bread and died a year later because of his injuries . 
  dont get me fucking started . 
  everyone in turkey uses a vpn , people get used to it . 
  necdet kent , the father of the current coca cola ceo saved a lot of lifes to . 
  he basically gave everyone who could say a full sentence in turkish citizenship . 
  those then turkish jews did not have to wear the jewish star on their clothes and were later evacuated to turkey . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/necdet_kent also not the first time jews from europe have been evacuated to turkey , the ottomans took jewish refugees from spain when they were dipsered and persecuted over [ there ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alhambra_decree ), 
  thought this was worth mentioning since everyone is blaming turkey without knowing any of the details . 
  you might not know him , bad he did some really bad things . 
  it doubt it would make a big difference if someone else was in place of erdogan . 
  the turkish position is clear and i think most of the opposition parties agree with it . 
  who decided that hamburg or any other city was a good place for a g20 meeting ? 
  better to keep it remote . 
  that looks delicious . 
  send some my way . 
  i remember seeing ads on mtv about her house arrest when i was younger . 
   in december 1997 in siirt , erdo\u011fan recited a poem from a work written by ziya g\u00f6kalp , a pan-turkish activist of the early 20th century . 
  [ 43 ] his recitation included verses translated as `` the mosques are our barracks , the domes our helmets , the minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers ... '' [ 29 ] which are not in the original version of the poem . 
  erdo\u011fan said the poem had been approved by the education ministry to be published in textbooks . 
  [ 44 ] under article 312/2 of the turkish penal code his recitation was regarded as an incitement to violence and religious or racial hatred . 
  [ 45 ] he was given a ten-month prison sentence of which he served four months , from 24 march 1999 to 27 july 1999 . 
  [ 7 ] due to his conviction , erdo\u011fan was forced to give up his mayoral position . 
  the conviction also stipulated a political ban , which prevented him from participating in parliamentary elections . 
  [ 46 ] he had appealed for the sentence to be converted to a monetary fine , but it was reduced to 120 days instead . 
  [ 47 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recep_tayyip_erdo%c4%9fan#imprisonment, 
  the poem in question btw :  erdogan was sentenced to a ten-month prison term for reciting a poem during a public address in the province of siirt in 1997 :  `` the minarets are our bayonets the domes our helmets the mosques our barracks and the faithful our soldiers . '', 
   `` one thing that i can not digest , if the skies and the ground were to open against us . 
  if floods and volcanoes were to burst upon us , we are those who are proud with the iman of our ancestors , they never kneeled down to frightening things any day , deeds of glory , deed of anatolia , from malazgirt til canakkale , faith impenetrable to fortresses , our ancestors rushing from one victory to another , this is unity and togetherness . '', 
   poem by ziya g\u00f6kalp [ source ] ( http://www.amara.org/en/videos/shiyp0uvt9ac/info/tayyip-erdogan-poem-that-landed-him-in-jail/ ),

  not like europe put pressure on him before the refugee crisis . 
  i volunteer !, 
  the downvotes are hitting my turkish comrades pretty hard in the comments . 
  many assyrians for example returned to turkey due to the conflicts in iraq and syria as far as i know and have build some really cool churches around mardin . 
  so yes , in a way he was expelling christians from gallipoli .

  people were threatend and killed for suggesting so . 
  turkic people : just passing through the region . 
  no need to pay attention to it .

  amsterdam to copenhagen is a 9 hour drive . 
  that 's like boston to pittsburgh . 
  would you have not considered giving your friend a call if he lived in pittsburgh and you were going to be in boston ? 
  i think it 's not entirely unreasonable , depending on the closeness of the relationship and given that an oceans being crossed , to meet up halfway in hamburg or nyc . 
  [ i 'm a highly desirable private residence in an area of outstanding property values ] ( https://youtu.be/vszghxb4caa?t=1m8s ), 
  i did n't mean why do n't you fill the entire north sea , i meant why not throw rocks into the water until its full instead of walling off an area and pumping the water out . 
  i guess the answer has something to do with where you would get enough rocks and relative expense . 
  though you must have done some amount of it . 
  i was kind of hoping to know what the dutch do with their rubble , wheter the land has actually risen any as buildings are torn down , the rubble burried and new concrete imported . 
  whenever a building gets torn down here , typically the steel will be recycled but the concrete will just get chucked into the sea to make coastal roadways . 
  while the dutch are the most well known for land reclamation , they are hardly the only ones to do it . 
  most of the chinese coastline is artificial , half of mumbai was under water a couple hundred years ago , but the polder method seems to be used mainly by the dutch . 
  everyone else pretty much just throws rocks into the water . 
  incidentally , if you tried to pump out the north sea like in / u/laoba 's post , the water has to go somewhere , so it would n't just be a problem for that ecosystem . 
  i thought you guys were n't in europe anymore, 
  i assume you also have to be constantly running pumps to prevent rain from collecting . 
  since you mentioned the north sea being very shallow , why not fill it in instead ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's how pretty much everybody else does it . 
  was it the hatred of the spanish that caused the hatred of the pope , or the hatred of the pope that caused the hatred of the spanish ? 
  i actually looked it up after making that comment . 
  i do n't think resellers should count and in the [ list i checked ] ( https://clients.txtnation.com/hc/en-us/articles/218714228-all-countries-list-of-mobile-operators-by-country-slow-loading - ) they were separated . 
  5 or even 6 operators were not as rare as i thought , but 3-4 is definitely the norm . 
  according to this list , finland has only 3 primary operators . 
  which sort of proves the point i 'm trying to make : whatever corelation exists between the number of operators in a country and price of service there , it is pretty diminished after you get your third operator . 
  therefore the discrepancies in price must be explained some other way . 
  the competitiveness of a market can not be determined by the number of competitors alone , the legislation in the country regulating competition and the sector as well respective market shares and financial structure of the individual companies are factors that can effect competitiveness of the market . 
  there are probably others that have n't occurred to me . 
  of course this is all based on the data from the link and people in this post have demonstrated that it is n't very reliable . 
  despite shaky data , i do n't expect that my analysis is off by much . 
  there must be diminishing returns for the consumer as more and more competitors enter the market . 
  and the sweet spot is between 3 and 4 . 
  furthermore as the number of competitors grow , at some point the market will become too saturated for any new companies to want to enter it . 
  a large market like india can handle quite a few more competitors than a small one like belgium . 
   we have like three serious providers here i do n't think there are that many countries that have more than 3 operators tbh . 
  more than 4 is probably really rare . 
  so i doubt it 's actually because of the number of countries you have . 
   you refferendum to earthquakes you hold referendums for earthquakes ? 
  i guess it is to be expected , birthplace of democracy and all , but i think that 's taking it a bit far . 
  do you cast your ballots into a volcano ? 
  i ca n't really argue with that . 
  i 've read also that looking for networks can cause a lot of issue , perhaps the phones you have were checking too often for networks , or perhaps the signal was too intermittent and it was disconnecting a lot . 
  i was just surprised . 
  btw if you care about battery life , but do n't care too much about how great your camera is , i would recomend a lenovo p2 or an asus zenfone max . 
  these both have about ~ 5000mah batteries , which is somewhere between double and 50 % more battery than most other phones . 
  i have the p2 and can play gta on it for 10 hours , or use it like a normal person for like 2-3 days before it runs out of juice . 
  realistically , i 'm still charging it every day , but it 's nice not to have to actually worry about saving the battery . 
  it 's heavier than my previous phone , but i 'm very happy with it . 
  shit 's also powerful , which is true of any similarly priced phone you would buy now . 
  it 's amazing to me that you can buy a phone that has basically the same specs as the middle range gaming laptop i bought in 2010 , for a third of the price , in a much smaller form factor and it manages to run much cooler with only passive cooling . 
  really makes you wonder how superior arm architecture is to x64 . 
  people i know that have the zenfone are super happy with it too , hopefully more manufacturers start making phones with extra large batteries , frankly i do n't understand why there are even phones on the market with less than 4ah , having to manage your battery sucks . 
   i never use wi-fi to prevent needless battery drain . 
  umm , generally speaking wifi should require less power than data . 
  it does of course depend , perhaps if your router is shit and the cellphone tower is close and within the line of sight and you get assigned a sufficiently low frequency and your router is set to the highest frequency i can see data consuming less power , but generally speaking it should be the other way around because of the distance the signal is expected to go . 
  the way i see a coat of arms on a flag is like the numbers you put at the end of a username when the one without numbers is taken . 
  well i do n't know about your country , but in the languages i know it 's called the ground floor or the surface floor or the earth floor not zero . 
  so it 's two melons and a banana , not three melons . 
  the ground floor is different , it does n't have to be suspended , it 's the ground . 
  but having a public discussion after a every terror attack causes knee jerk reactions . 
  if someone has a new idea on how to prevent terror they should n't wait till the next attack to express it and the authorities should n't wait until the next attack to listen . 
  conversely if no one has anything new to say , why have the same discussion over and over again ? 
  governments , particularly the intelligence service do need to be vigilant , but expecting private citizens to be vigilant is more likely to empower racists than solve anything . 
  it also increases the terror felt by the public , the very point of these attacks . 
  frankly whenever i hear a politician saying that the public needs to be vigilant , i think they want to scare me into being willing to shell out more for the military and police or go along with more intrusive invasions of my privacy . 
  could it not be argued that treating terror attacks like car accidents disempowers terrorists ? 
  is n't the whole point of committing an act of terror to get people to pay attention to a cause ? 
  perhaps if people did treat them like sad but mundane occurrences they would n't happen as often . 
  what positive result does our current reactions even accomplish ? 
  so do we . 
  that picture looks like merkel is doing an italian impression in front of a mexican flag for some reason . 
  `` hey , enrique , hey , hey , enrique , look i 'm mario draghi : ` spaghetti bolognese ' '' . 
  it 's not really left leaning , i think it 's mostly center right , but european center right . 
  you should see the consulate in [ istanbul ] ( https://www.google.com.tr/search?q=us+consulate+in+istanbul&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjvgma10p_uahvcb5okhu2kc1gq_auicigb&amp;biw=1376&amp;bih=707#imgrc=tcwotfsrxoyspm: ), 
   but rather to give women a platform from which they can train and progress to the point where some of them might be able to join the actual special forces . 
  i am all for women in the military but this is the dumbest place to put them . 
  sure some women might be able to hack it and they should n't be excluded but really there are combat roles where women would actually have an advantage like pilots . 
  if you design a plane around the smaller and lighter pilot you can either armor the plane better , or make it smaller and therefore harder to hit , or put more fuel in it , or pack more ammo on it , or some combination of those . 
  you would have a similar situation in tanks , though the weight savings are pretty irrelevant in that case it 's all about saving a few cubic feet of volume , which can be used to store more ammo or fuel . 
  probably not worth a redesign but it makes sense to put more women in existing tanks because they would be less uncomfortable in them . 
  but special forces or any unit that is expected to travel long distances on foot is where physical strength matters the most . 
  you want these troops to carry as much ammo and equipment as possible . 
  the majority of women will not do as well in these roles as the majority of men . 
  i would also not want the vast majority of women behind a rapid fire gun with a lot of recoil . 
  women wont make the best mg crews . 
  but they will make good snipers . 
  she might occasionally have an advantage by being able to hide in a spot a male sniper would not fit in . 
  i think most of the military establishments in the world are not at all interested in having women in actual combat roles and thus their inclusion is purely as window dressing to appear progressive . 
  if they were serious about integrating women these kinds of things would be discussed instead of this absolutist bullshit dichotomy where women are either never as good as men and that they might be better in any regard is n't even a consideration or they just as good as men in every regard and to say that they might not be as good in certain tasks is taboo . 
  no it means land of hindus . 
  the stan ending is persian . 
  both with turkey and india , the name of the country is older than the name of the bird since they come from south america and were only introduced into europe after colombus . 
  so the bird was named after the country not the other way around . 
  why people were so ignorant back then , i do n't know . 
  we got away pretty lucky . 
   if some kind of economic revolutionary event happens like what ? 
   and the world decides that currency needs to be backed by a commodity again nothing prevents people from using gold and silver certificates as a medium exchange instead of fiat currency . 
  they still exist . 
  you can get them from your bank . 
  people do n't do it because it 's inconvenient as the value of precious metals relative to other commodities is nowhere near as stable as that of fiat currencies . 
  at the end of the day since you can eat neither paper money or silver you are relying on peoples belief that those things have value .

  but why was n't he deported from belgium in the first place ? 
  damn you must be really pissed at something to go on reddit and pathetically insult a random person . 
  it does n't really look like they target civilians . 
  that 's becuase western media does n't show the shit they do . 
  here is a great post that compiled some of the sick stuff pkk did https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3g9kxl/very_disturbing_video_of_kurdish_workers/ctw84eo  kurdish civilians are targeted in suicide bombings so close to an election , and police wo n't allow anyone to render aid ? 
  why people saying `` kurdish civilians '' % 90 of the people in rally were turks it was a anti-war rally not pro-pkk rally . 
   and police wo n't allow anyone to render aid ? 
  sounds suspicious . 
  turkish police known to be pretty bad lately but i did n't heard something like that ambulances arrived as fast as they could after the attack ...  meanwhile , the iraqi kurds came to the aid of the stranded yazidis and provide refuge to arab christians and jews who face persecution from isis . 
  you know peshmarga is basically turkey 's biggest ally in the region and hate pkk right ? 
  they also came though turkey to save the folk that got persecuted by isis . 
   they have also had their basic rights restricted by the turkish government in recent history so did black americans back in the day but hey as you said `` history '' and it 's not that recent . 
  it 's literally more than 50 years ago unless you 're talking about 80s coup government which fucked over everybody . 
  never said i did n't care it 's just that those events are ultimately are n't the reason pkk exists today . 
  pkk founders were inmates of diyarbakir prison and there they got tortured in the most inhumane ways you can think of . 
  ( fyi diyarbakir prison is literally in the world 's 10 worst prisons ) after they were released they were n't able to return to their old lifes anymore because of their hatred to turkish government so they founded a separatist movement . 
  the previous kurdish rebellions were mostly religious and had isis like leaders . 
  they were n't because of kurdish identity they were because of turkey 's secularism and abolishment of caliphate . 
  i did n't give my personal opinion i just gave the stance of the government . 
  i personally believe it was a genocide and we should recognize it so we can actually clear some misinformation about this tragic event also it 's out of topic because it 's not even remotly releted to what we were talking about while i just gave you scenario . 
  i could have given it from any time or place in history and choose black americans . 
   was the turkish language banned ? 
  really dude is that where you stuck at ? 
  after reading all those human right abuses you stuck at banning of using kurdish officially ? 
  * sigh * i think you 're bit confused about the kurdish ban . 
  kurds still talked kurdish with each-other without much problem what was banned where publishing , naming anything in kurdish . 
  like you could n't open a shop in kurdish , have an official kurdish name or publish a kurdish song . 
  talking kurdish was only forbidden in actual government buildings . 
   secondly do n't act like it 's a thing of the past . 
  there are only 1 separate event before the stuff the coup government did and that 's dersim massacre which is horrible and even erdogan apologized for it . 
   nice redirection . 
  is there a movement for an independent black state in the us ? 
  did i say turkey should cede territory to a plausible kurdistan ? 
  do blacks speak a different language than white americans ? 
  are they a nationality ? 
  there is n't . 
  i was giving you a scenario and asking for your opinion about it . 
  never claimed there were such thing . 
  kurdish was banned , the concept of being kurdish was banned that did n't happen to turks . 
  you really do n't know anything about the stuff the coup goverment did if you 're seriously saying that let me give you a bit of perspective . 
   650,000 people were under arrest . 
   1,683,000 people were blacklisted . 
   230,000 people were judged in 210,000 lawsuits . 
   7,000 people were asked for the death penalty . 
   517 persons were sentenced to death . 
   50 of those given the death penalty were executed ( 26 political prisoners , 23 criminal offenders and 1 asala militant ) . 
   the files of 259 people , which had been asked for the death penalty , were sent to the national assembly . 
   71,000 people were judged on account of the articles 141 , 142 and 163 in turkish penal code . 
   98,404 people were judged on charges of being members of a leftist , a rightist , a nationalist , a conservative , etc. 
  organization . 
   388,000 people were not given a passport . 
   30,000 people were dismissed from their firms because they were suspects and therefore inconvenient . 
   14,000 people were removed from citizenship . 
   30,000 people went abroad as a political refugee . 
   300 people died in a suspicious manner . 
   documented that 171 people died by reason of torture . 
   937 films were banned because these were found objectionable . 
   23,677 associations had their activities stopped . 
   3,854 teachers , 120 lecturers and 47 judges were dismissed . 
   400 journalists were asked a total of 4000 years ' imprisonment . 
   journalists were sentenced 3315 years and 6 months ' imprisonment . 
  31 journalists went to jail . 
   300 journalists were attacked . 
   3 journalists were shot dead . 
   300 days in which newspapers were not published . 
   303 cases were opened for 13 major newspapers . 
   39 tonnes of newspapers and magazines were destroyed . 
   299 people lost their lives in prison . 
   144 people died in a suspicious manner . 
   14 people died in a hunger strike . 
   while fleeing , 16 people were shot . 
   95 people were killed in combat . 
   `` natural death report '' for 73 persons was given . 
   the cause of death of 43 people was announced as `` suicide '' . 
  after reading this if you can say that turks were alright under the coup government and it was just minorities that were targeted . 
  i really do n't know what else can i say . 
   which according to the same government totally did n't happen out of topic but that 's not true according to official stance of turkish government it did happen but it was n't an genocide it . 
  they 're seen as generic massacres . 
   i do n't even understand this brand of whataboutism ? 
  what is there to not understand ? 
  you 're saying it 's okay for pkk to do terrorism in turkey because of past oppression and i 'm asking you should black americans start trying to have their own state because of past slavery , segregation , racism etc. . . 
  if you say no then you would be a hypocrite . 
   you 're saying it 's okay because the us supported it lol is that what you understood ? 
  i 'm saying it 's not something we wanted . 
  yet we 're paying the price for it . 
  we did n't want to ban kurdish , we did n't want to torture , hang kurds . 
  the coup government did all of that alongside to nationalists , communists , journalists , politicians and to law abiding citizens . 
  everybody was fucked over . 
  one of my relatives married to a german man and she did n't really had much trouble she 's still learning german and continue living in germany which is how it should be in my opinion . 
  eh true but what he said is n't really wrong at all . 
  pkk is a terrorist organization that literally responsible % 90 of the terrorism in turkey so turkey has all the right to bomb them to oblivion . 
  should black people in us rebel and start shooting up people because of past events ? 
  ffs 80s coup was literally supported by us and oppressed everybody why you act like we voted for oppression of kurds ? 
   turkey could cut off islamic state 's supply lines . 
  we could n't even cut pkk 's supply lines for the last 30 years how come we 're able to do it with isis ? 
  us and turkey agreed to secure the syrian border between turkey and isis at g20 summit so that might help a bit but why do people act like there is a switch that turkey can just turn off and all the isis ' supply lines will be gone . 
  eh i do n't agree with you at all . 
  how would you feel if you were n't able to bring your wife with you to your home just because she did n't know english ? 
  learning a new language takes time and it takes a lot more time than normal when you do n't hear it everyday and you 're an adult . 
  you would basically be separate for years or would stay at your spouse 's country .

  unlike some other countries in the region turkey 's borders is n't drawn by imperialistic western powers . 
  we fought and shed our blood for every inch of it . 
  and it 's one of the atat\u00fcrk 's legacies to us . 
  he gave lots of speeches about indivisibility of our lands so no . 
  i 'm all for minority rights and voted for hdp in the last elections with a naive hope like they will cut their connections to pkk . 
  but unfortunately they did n't . 
  i am very unhappy about how akp handled the `` peace process '' . 
  i personally like the us 's stance against this kind of situation better . 
  a simple `` we do n't negotiate with terrorists '' . 
  most of the victims were n't etchnically kurdish . 
  they were socialists university students from all over turkey . 
  tell that to israeli citizens that will die by iranian funded organizations . 
  seriously if you think iran is different than saudi arabia you are so naive , my friend . 
  they also have freakin sharia law for fucks sake !, 
  iran is a theocracy . 
  like 3/4 days ago they hanged a 14 years old child for being gay ... 
  stop the occupation of cyprus ? 
  i agree . 
  acknowledge armenian genocide ? 
  ok , agree with this too . 
  kurdish self-determination ? 
  well , no . 
  uk is n't in a position to decide other countries ' borders and attack their sovereignty . 
   sorting the cluster fuck on their asia minor borders what do you mean by that ? 
  you do n't even know where asia minor is , do n't you ? 
  i sense a little gallipoli butthurt . 
  * turkish intervention do n't forget it was totaly legal . 
  what is not legal and the real proplem is occupation which happening still . 
  let 's just hope both communities agree on a unification plan soon and this time without guarantor powers . 
  a peaceful cyprus for just cypriots . 
  well , as a 1/4 greek turkish i was feeling pretty bad about recent `` bashing greeks '' circlejerk in r/europe and if it gon na make you guys friends again , im happy being the evil enemy < 3, 
  good , kudos to romanians !, 
  i also do n't want my tax money to spend on religious buildings . 
  i do n't think article nr 5 has anything to do with terrorist attacks . 
  not from a european country but i nominate [ this b * tch ] ( http://www.kaosgl.org/resim/turkandagolu.jpg ) / t\u00fcrkan da\u011fo\u011flu . 
  mp from akp ( erdo\u011fan 's conservative party ) . 
   in 29 may 2013 , a parliamentary research motion regarding the lgbt rights in turkey were proposed and discussed in the parliament of turkey .

  they have some shitty , expensive af sandwiches for hipsters, 
  it is wrong , burgerking  mcdonalds for turkey . 
  jeez , it 's just our weekly foreplay/military training . 
  stop making news about it guys . 
  civilians did n't deserve it . 
  it 's also a shameful thing to describe human lifes as `` collateral damage '' . 
  this is a good example of tasteless satire . 
  he is albanian - just like you - not turkish , my dear `` leftover '' friend . 
  close saudi funded mosques , stop illegal immigration etc. 
  seriously guys come to r/turkey , we have much more relaxed mods when it comes to criticising islamists and refugee policies :d, 
  how many people have to die before it 's too late ? 
  france does have an extremism problem within their muslim community . 
  lets fucking hope left wing parties realize that this time . 
   you are right though , it is abnormally high , but then so is turkey 's . 
  the moment the two shake their dicks and let the pissing contest cease will be a great moment for greece 's creditors . 
  can you please explain how our military spending is `` abnormaly high '' ? 
  did you just forsake eastern thrace ? 
   fucking minarets guys , everything is not a dildo even if you are brave enough . 
  it 's an internet lie . ^ believeme, 
  turkey is turkey . 
  it is n't european or middle eastern . 
  our whole thing is being a bridge between western and eastern cultures . 
   thats the problem you talk about the assad regime and ypg like they are a greater evil when there is no such enemy as barbaric as isis . 
  yeap , isis are bunch of barbaric islamic nutjobs but they are not a serious threat to any modern army . 
  turkey can finish them easily with a proper military operation as long as they are in syria/iraq trying to form a state not in a `` southeastern turkey guerrilla warfare '' . 
  which is what kurdish separatist terrorist organization are doing in past 30 years . 
   whose side is turkey on ? 
  simple question . 
  you do n't need a political article to answer that . 
  turkey is on turkey 's side . 
  like all the countries around the world turkey has its own interests too . 
  surprise , eh ? 
  we support iraqi kurdistan 's president barzani 's political party kdp in kurdish politics against ypg/pkk . 
  we train and arm krg 's peshmergas against isis and also for a possible conflict with other kurdish groups . 
  we support various rebel groups against assad regime and isis . 
  we mostly turn a blind eye to isis fighters crossing syria because they are also fight against assad regime , ypg and some other islamist rebel groups that we do n't like them to have too much power over syria 's future . 
  basically whole war is a win/win situation to us exept refugee problem . 
  europe does this too . 
  how jihadis from europe can fly to countries around syria so easily with intelligence agencies like yours ? 
  because you also want them to go there . 
  it 's better them to die in a syrian desert than a terrorist attack/suicide bomb in europe/turkey . 
  probably not russians but personally i would be damn happy if we can switch syrian refugees with ukranian ones . 
  it 's in our genes to do so . 
  i ca n't help it . ^ / s, 
  and native americans suffered enourmously , just saying,

  client commits a crime . 
  prostitute commits no crime, 
  i 'm not a european but i must say that if your `` defining characteristic '' is being religious ( muslim/christian etc ) then you are n't living in modern age . 
  a healty , progressive society ca n't coexist with some rulebooks from thousands of years ago . 
  i do n't know other countries such as lebanon but our refugee camps definitely not `` places to pitch their tents '' . 
  [ syrian refugees costs us around $ 17 billion . 
  ] ( http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/04/turkey-iraq-syria-cost-of-crisis-16-billion.html# ) [ infact there is a new york times article about how comfy our camps are . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/magazine/how-to-build-a-perfect-refugee-camp.html?_r=0 ), 
   that 's because the turkish islamist crazies are supporting al nusra and the other `` moderates '' ( lol ) of the syrian civil war . 
  us and turkey both support rebels against assad regime . 
  we arm a lot of rebel groups . 
  this is not a secret.there is some `` speculations '' about where this weapons go . 
  i 'm definitely not the happiest man about erdo\u011fan 's syrian civil war policy but i do n't think he armed al nusra .

    when cyprus did get its independence , the resulting arrangement proved unworkable . 
  cypriot turks understandably insisted cyprus should be an independent country with a federal system that would give them a large degree of autonomy while retaining their privileges . 
  cypriot greeks remained seduced by the idea of joining greece . 
  eoka was intimately linked to ultranationalist elements of the greek armed forces . 
  union with greece had always been on the post independence agenda . 
   there were countless cases of score settling against cypriot turks . 
  turkey was naturally alarmed and sought to protect its minority in cyprus while looking for an opportunity to expand its borders . 
    archbishop makarios was maintaining a fragile balance with intrinsically disloyal security forces ( who wanted union ) . 
  but he was maintaining the balance and that kept turkish troops out for the moment . 
    kissinger once called makarios the castro of the mediterranean . 
  his continued rule of cyprus was inimical to the interests of the united states . 
  but there was nobody else who could replace him and still keep the balance . 
  when the greek junta hatched a plan to overthrow makarios with a coup and annex the island , kissinger was delighted . 
  this gave turkey the legal pretext to invade cyprus in order to protect cypriot turks . 
  and so they did . 
  and things settled down a bit on the front lines as frantic diplomacy broke out . 
  the upshot of the diplomacy was an american green light for a second turkish offensive to seize and occupy more land , expell the native greek population and permanently divide the island , like haiti and the dominican republic . 
  this guaranteed a reliable nato ally controlled at least part of the island permanently . 
  although the uk had and still has bases in cyprus , they are not as permanent a solution as a whole population . 
  to that end , turkey began colonizing the occupied territory with indigent turks from anatolia . 
  cypriot turks were n't exactly liberated . 
  they just had a new daddy . 
    at some point this whole occupation of cyprus thing became bad pr for turkey , as evidenced by the us arms embargo on turkey . 
  so they had to call it something else . 
  they made a puppet state and carried on as usual . 
  as time went by , the pinocchio state in northern cyprus started turning into a real thinking creature . 
  turkey and greece have taken a step back since cyprus joined the eu . 
  the enosis/union issue is no longer on the table so turkey has relaxed and given its puppet more leeway . 
  turkey was ( still is ? ), 
  to government of northern cyprus what the ayatollah is to the government of iran , the final decision maker . 
  currently the two sides are trying to negotiate a unification plan in better faith than ever before . 
  you do n't become a regional power without any cards,

  wikipedia is full of false information when it comes to turkey ( or basically any non-western country ) , i would n't pay it much attention . 
  he has a very punchable face . 
  it would look good on a pike as well or at the end of a rope . 
  and turkish elections are so fair and unbiased . 
  no fraud whatsoever . 
  wow , `` nein '' is smaller , that absolves voters of that era of all crime !, 
  we celebrate nevruz as well , probably not at the same extent though . 
  he would have lost the referendum if it was n't for the massive fraud , intimidation and unethical propaganda they did . 
  i consider all elections from now on null and void . 
  changes are not impossible but harder and more painful with dogmatic ideologies . 
  it 's funny to me because it sounds nonsensical to someone familiar with muslim culture . 
  they will be seen as heretics by their fellow muslims , and nothing more . 
  some muslims try to water down their belief when they ca n't face with how barbaric their religion is . 
  here is a fun saying : the dog that barks will not bite . 
  it 's hard to keep track of all the bullshit our politicians say . 
  i doubt europe will do anything too to be honest . 
  it would strengthen erdo\u011fan 's hand to start with . 
  i bet he kinda wants europe to do something that 's why he is provoking them with statements such as this .

  i was gon na write something but i realized i do n't really disagree . 
  i want syrians out of my country for example . 
  nobody is comfortable with sharing their country with foreigners whom they deem as inferior in culture . 
  most turks in reddit are immigrants in europe . 
  europe made a mistake by accepting uneducated hordes of workers with open arms . 
  now they made immigrating so difficult educated turks ca n't move to europe . 
  that 's why you have the worst of our lot . 
   he 's known for burning his victims in waste oil . 
  what can we say ... shakira law does n't allow even waste oil to go to waste . 
  either burn people with it or pour it over your ass so it shines under sunlight when you are wearing a thong . 
  strange , all the rightist leaders we had were bitches of superpowers and our only leftist leader had the guts to tell foreign powers to gtfo and did a military operation that a nationalist leader could only dream of . 
  it 's funny because turks of turkey say similar things to the turks of cyprus , like `` if you wan na get genocided then sure we 'll leave you the fuck alone '' cypriots of both turkish and greek origin want to be left alone and it 's best we let them , but of course this is n't an ideal world so we 'll fight over a nation that does n't even want us . 
  it 's very obvious that you are trying to make an argument about a topic you do n't know anything about . 
  you could n't have used a worse example . 
  read about how armeanians invaded it for armenian minority and also do n't use examples you do n't know shit about if you do n't want to make a fool of yourself . 
  it 's funny that you do n't see the irony . 
  good ol' times when we could loot and destroy and rape with impunity . 
  man , those were the days . 
  i remember those days because i 'm like a thousand year old and can be perfectly held responsible for such things . 
  how to win an argument against a turk : bring up kurds or armenians out of context . 
  well i ca n't say turkey is a reliable friend . 
  things are a bit shaky with nato and further we move away from nato more we will find ourselves on friendly terms with russia . 
  yeah we downed their jet and stuff but we keep being enemies with former friends and friends with former enemies all the time . 
  i 'm sorry if my inferior race offends you . 
  first time somebody said something like that to me non-sarcastically . 
  i 'm not crying there is something in my eye . 
  they already fucked the country up in the 80s by installing a coup government . 
  no need to fuck things up further . 
  if not for the us-backed coup we probably would n't have to deal with this shit . 
  that affected our national identity greatly . 
  the problem is religion , more precisely the fucking uncivilized ideology that is called islam . 
  look at all those muslim countries in the middle east .

  yeah , religion .

  ignorant and uneducated nations ca n't be led by democracy .

  story behind that image ? 
  wow you really opened my mind to what sharia is . 
  i always thought it was a magical place filled with rainbows and butterflies where they hand out free candy for everyone . 
  thank you good sir . 
  turkey can become more european but joining eu will never happen . 
  they still see us a bit too secular for their taste . 
  if turkey declares sharia definitely then . 
  arabs think we are too much european . 
  westerners think we are too much middle eastern . 
  maybe oceania will accept us . 
  people in turkey have been aware that eu was the dangling ascension card in front of turkey to lead us to wherever they want . 
  we realized this like a decade ago . 
  people are fed up and tired of this eu ascension meme anyway . 
  both europeans and turks are aware that hell will freeze over before turkey joins eu , no need for this fake process . 
  there is also a new generation of uber-religious youth too . 
  when i see some weird news on tv , i instinctively think of adana . 
  there was a bomb call once for a suspicious bag and while the bag was sitting there some guy just walked into it and kicked at it . 
  defusing bombs the adana way . 
  we are a nation that checks for gas leakages with a lighter but adana always takes it to the extreme . 
  yes because everything a turk says must be related to armenian genocide in some way or the other . 
  i ca n't breathe in this sub with this flair without someone throwing that in my face . 
  far-rightists around the world hate each other but they are so much alike . 
  then again , confusing hills is a bit less dumber . 
  i 've come to understand that * history * is little more than a collection of facts that people or governments choose to believe/act like they believe because it suits them . 
  it does n't need to relate to reality . 
  if turkish government apologizes for turks moving into anatolia in 10 . century and genociding pontics and whatever , will people on reddit stop complaining about us invading anatolia or telling us to go back to central asia ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  year can be 3000 and westerners will still complain about turks invading anatolia 2000 years ago . 
  earth will be united under one government and we will be a space-faring civilization , and some greek or armenian or pontic or cappadocian or eskimo on planet alpha centauri will be bitter about antolia . 
  this butthurt is eternal . 
  also , scandavians have n't apologized for raiding and settling british coasts , nor did anglo-saxons apologize for attacking britons . 
  same with every other nation . 
  we 'll go back to central asia when americans return to europe or africa or everyone else to mesopotamia or anglo-saxons back to denmark and north germany . 
  why do we get isolated for doing something that everyone else did ? 
  well it 's not that bad . 
  like i said it 's just a generalization that most of turkey would agree with .

  there is no way erdogan does n't have indisputable proof of gulen 's involvement because they used to be allies . 
  i heard literally 85 boxes of evidence is being send to usa . 
  gulen is also seem to be getting desperate . 
  i wonder how much cash he paid to new york times [ to write his own article on their front page ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/26/opinion/fethullah-gulen-i-condemn-all-threats-to-turkeys-democracy.html ), 
  usa 's response the formal extradition request when it 's made will decide the turkey 's relations with usa in years to come . 
  fingers are crossed this is different than just supporting ypg that might one day pose us a threat . 
  usa would literally be playing pakistan after 9/11 if they refuse to give gulen . 
  also turkey had arrest warrant for gulen for years . 
  first back in late 90s when he ran to usa and cia gave him a green card then when erdogan-gulen alliance broke up . 
   we do n't want this http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36973314 to happen with kurds or anyone else here . 
  what kind of retarded argument is that ? 
  if you 're serious foreign minister 's comment is literally on point . 
   akp sheeps smashed some shops and marked possible kurdish and g\u00fclen houses in vienna . 
  this is not turkey . 
  that is why they say this . 
  source ? 
  did something happen to turks in austria that i missed ? 
  why is he randomly saying this ? 
  you could n't when it was airing . 
  poor kid . 
  sadly our police does n't really care much about the syrians . 
  do n't expect to get any protection in turkey as a refugee . 
  if he was a tourist police would have acted differently ... 
  i bet this gang who did these stuff to him knows this and purposefully target syrians . 
  i do not see what 's really wrong with this sentence . 
  did he scream allahu akbar ? 
  as far as i know no ... police is supposed to investigate and find the truth not just give the most possible motive as a fact . 
  mostly but since ypg became the official ground army of the west against isis . 
  the weapons given to them ends up at pkk 's hands as well . 
  some peshmerga soldiers also apparently sell their german made weapons in the black market for shit load of cash . 
  even our refugees are not exactly refugees . 
  [ in eid a good chunk of them went back to syria to visit their relatives ] ( http://www.dailysabah.com/nation/2016/07/01/syrian-refugees-return-to-syria-to-mark-muslim-holiday ) . 
  like wtf ? 
  if your home is safe enough to leave your relatives you 're no refugee . 
  i said the [ same thing ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4vxzf3/greece_urges_eu_to_comes_up_with_plan_b_for/d62xe6q?context=3 ) yesterday and people downvoted me : /, 
  well how about you give those islands to us then we 'll make those islands camps and take the backlash for you ? 
  plan b is throwing greece under the bus i guess and hoping that refugees would eventually go back after they realize that the farthest europe they 'll reach is greece . 
  no way any eu country will accept the increase in migrant quotas once the migrant road reopens since it looks like we 'll ditch the deal . 
   the problem is the submitted evidence is hearsay and speculation gained by torture . 
  it is n't legally admissible or binding in a us court for an extradition hearing . 
  did you see the evidence yourself ? 
  we do n't know what 's submitted yet erdogan and gulen used to be buddies i 'm sure he can tie the coup plotter generals to him . 
   they 'd need a literal recording of gulen giving orders . 
  well we have him giving orders to his followers to infiltrate in to turkey and wait for the `` time '' from 1999 here 's the english translation . 
   you must move in the arteries of the system without anyone noticing your existence until you reach all the power centers . 
  until the conditions are ripe , they [ the followers ] must continue like this . 
  if they do something prematurely , the world will crush our heads , and muslims will suffer everywhere , like in the tragedies in algeria , like in 1982 [ in ] syria , . 
  like in the yearly disasters and tragedies in egypt . 
  the time is not yet right . 
  you must wait for the time when you are complete and conditions are ripe , until we can shoulder the entire world and carry it . 
  you must wait until such time as you have gotten all the state power , until you have brought to your side all the power of the constitutional institutions in turkey . 
  now , i have expressed my feelings and thoughts to you all -- in confidence . 
  trusting your loyalty and secrecy . 
  i know that when you leave here , [ just ] as you discard your empty juice boxes , you must discard the thoughts and the feelings that i expressed here . 
  well now that i wrote this comment i did i little search i found [ this ] ( http://www.city-journal.org/html/who-fethullah-g%c3%bclen-13504.html ) . 
  only article about him that explains everything with from several points of views however it 's outdated still no recent articles about him . 
  claire berlinski seems to know what she 's talking about . 
  here 's [ her insight about the coup ] ( http://www.city-journal.org/html/who-planned-turkeys-coup-14656.html ) . 
  edit : [ another very good article ] ( https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2016-08-02/roots-gulenist-power-turkey?cid=soc-tw-rdr ) but it has a soft paywall . 
  here 's also a [ video source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqrn540zvf0 ) for people who do n't want to read however the video goes a bit tin-foily . 
  i mean you guys think erdogan is bad ? 
  check gulen out ... 
  this is my beef with western media . 
  there are billions of articles about the coup not one explaining people who or what gulen is properly and why most turks are not filling the streets protesting the purges . 
  i mean you can deny his involvement all you want but at least explain who the main suspect is . 
  whether us taking the gulen 's side or not will be decided if they refuse to extradite gulen with the submitted evidence . 
  this is the most ironic article on the guardian i have ever seen . 
  regardless anybody who follows western media like me from outside can see the massive bias in it . 
  eh everybody knows wtf is going on in turkey and with western media 's extremely shitty reporting and articles about it , i would have been surprised if we were n't the least popular . 
  when russia was on the spot we they would have been the least popular as well . 
  also why even ask to norway ? 
  lol ... 
  it is ... 
  turkey is a funny country when you 're no living in it ... 
  still i prefer to be on the front page with news like this instead of more grim stuff . 
  i believe if those happened we would have heard about it by now . 
  things we know however is they 're stripped and made lay on the floor for long hours with their hands tied from the back and they 're made to stare on erdogan 's face . 
  i love how when catholics finally get a pope that understand christianity people start declaring him a false one . 
  same in turkey . 
  fucking hate that shit ... 
   i also find it kind of ironic that turkey baselessly accuses us to `` support gullen '' ( which is blatantly false and ridiculous ) then imitate gullen and act identically in germany starting it 's own parrallele `` turkish network '' and giant `` protests '' in an european country . 
  he accused usa of supporting gulen because they refused to extradite him not the europe he accusing europe of supporting terrorism for harboring pkk terrorists . 
  it 's a separate matter from gulen . 
   he also said turkey had sent germany more than 4,000 files on what he said were wanted terrorists , but the country did nothing . 
  good idea i for one welcome the turkish republic of greece . 
  it would n't even take 50 years to take control of entire greek government and do a referendum to join turkey . 
  since there are more turks in istanbul than entire greek population in greece . 
  seems like nobody here read the article at all . 
  % 90 of the article is about usa not germany . 
  germany has no experience nor the influence over any foreign country 's military to even manage to orchestrate a coup . 
  europe is known for their human rights , economy and high living standards o not from their ruthless intelligence agencies . 
  you would have fucked up even worse than gulen if you tried to orchestrate a coup outside of your own nation . 
  well there 's no chance that they 'll get death penalty . 
  do n't know about torture however . 
  it seems like every arrested coup soldier have some light scars on their faces and their hands really looks like left tied for a long time . 
  seems like they 're giving the soldiers `` turkish punishment '' instead of time in jail they 're getting some punches and humiliations . 
  too bad germany is n't fascist anymore huh ? 
   turkey would be allowed to join . 
  what does he means by that exactly ? 
  does he mean if we join or if we `` allowed '' to join .

  with which peashooter are you planing to do that mr. armchair general ? 
  germany how hard it 's to say is `` we have freedom of speech here fuck of '' to erdogan ? 
  you 're only allowing his ego to grow more which is bad for us ... 
  nobody actually believes that muslims fucks goats or what i said . 
  it 's a joke do n't be so sensitive . 
  jokes supposed to be offensive . 
  well at least we 're not fucking pigs . 
  do n't see the mistake the poem was `` deliberately offensive '' as she described even b\u00f6hmermann himself said it was offensive ... 
  the problem is he should n't be prosecuted for it . 
  not like the courts will side with erdogan . 
  it would create a massive shitstorm . 
  erdogan really wants to make an example of these guys . 
  they just made a petition that called the end of the operations against terrorists . 
  hardly a reason to prosecute anyone ... 
   i see your fuming mostly hot air and little content , you may leave that sort of behaviour if you wish to be taken seriously . 
  i should be the one who 's saying this . 
  all your comments thus far are filled with racist assumptions with no basis . 
  you keep saying `` turks would do that '' turks would do this '' i 'm really grasping here to take your points seriously . 
   it does n't work like that , you wo n't get deported . 
  countries like turkey probably would n't even accept a deportee ( or use it as blackmail ) here 's another racist assumption . 
  show me one example of turkey refusing to take back one of their nationals who are deported from somewhere . 
  you ca n't because it does n't exist turkey monitors their citizens in foreign countries like a helicopter parent . 
  in fact akp is trying to get the european turks to return back to their homeland like japan does . 
   and local authorities do not have the manpower to track every illegal overstayer down , since they live and work illegally they remain below the radar . 
  why do you think they make you buy a return ticket and show it before letting you in to the country genius ? 
  it 's so they can easily detect the people who over stay their welcome . 
  all you need to do is check if they boarded the plane or not if they did n't then you 'll instantly get connected and deported . 
   the visa process is there to check wether that 's a possibility , in which case you will not get a visa . 
  no it 's not even some goat fucker from a remote village can get a visa if they bring all the necessary papers . 
  the problem is it takes way too much time to get it right even if you get accepted at the first try it takes like a month to get your visa . 
  you literally need to be a felon to be completely be denied . 
   and removing the visa regime is asking for illegal immigrants , and we would get illegal immigrants . 
  i say no thank you , we 've enough issues with migration as is . 
  we 've little to gain and more to lose from visa free travel with turkey . 
  almost every single turkish immigrant in europe is legal . 
  the illegal immigration of turks to europe is almost non-existent and will continue that way when the visa-free travel happens . 
  please give me your source about these illegal turkish immigrants . 
  you know i figured you out . 
  you 're not really concerned about illegal immigration you just do n't want turks in europe whether they come for tourism , business or for stay . 
   of course it does , overstaying on visa is the easiest and cheapest way to illegally migrate . 
  and you 'll get deported in instant . 
  one requirement of visa free travel is you need to buy your a return ticket beforehand and also your logic is seriously flawed you can overstay even with a visa . 
  apparently in 2015 900.000 visas were issued to turkish citizens why are they not overstaying to illegally migrate then ? 
   tell that to the millions already here . 
  you invited them and gave citizenship to them yourself they did n't force their way in you ask for foreign workers you get foreign workers but ofc learning history might be a bit too much before having an opinion . 
   and it 's the people , citizens of western europe that will suffer from it . 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about do you ? 
  europe would benefit immensely from visa free travel . 
  it 's almost not worth it to travel to eu because of the ridiculous visa process even getting a simple tourist visa takes unnecessary amount of time an effort . 
  do you hate money or something ? 
  you can just jump to a plane and visit istanbul for few days but us ? 
  i would need to plan stuff months ahead , ready shit load of papers and hope that i would get accepted at first try so my trip plan would not crumble . 
   there 's good reason for that . 
  we would be opening up a new illegal migration route if we led turks travel visa free . 
  you do n't even understand the concept of visa-free travel ... you 're not making migrating to europe any easier by giving us visa free travel and i do n't know where you guys read that bullshit but no millions of turks are not trying to migrate to eu . 
   their middle classes and below are also much less likely to fly over than turks might be . 
  and this is a bad thing why exactly ? 
  people flying over to your nation is a good thing do you dislike turks so much that you do n't even want their money ? 
  what does visa free travel has to do with the government exactly ? 
  you guys trying way too hard to deny everything concerning turkish people that it kinda makes you look like a fool . 
  it 's the people , citizens of turkey that 'll benifit from this not the government . 
  ban erdogan from your nation if you do n't want him coming over he can already do that right now whenever he pleases but we citizens need to pass from a living hell for simple trip to eu . 
  try traveling to country that requires visa from you and you 'll understand how if feels to run all around collecting papers that i do n't even know why they want it and get denied by a bullshit reason which they do n't even tell you so you have to guess and keep trying . 
  dammit erdogan you and bahceli could please die already ... 
  not at all it 's extremely rare in turkey . 
  i thought it was literally non-existent here but someone told me yesterday on reddit that it exists in specific parts of the country to the some extend . 
  i never came across to anybody who refuses to handshake or touch the opposite gender 's hand before . 
  i just called erdogan he 's coming for your ass with his small dick !, 
  we do n't . 
  what ?!, 
  men shaking women 's hands ? 
  ridiculous !, 
  i 'll never understand these student unions in uk ... 
  so what does erdogan intend to do with this . 
  are you gon na arrest these people if they ever come back to turkey ? 
   do n't start sympathizing for the dutch turks yet . 
  most of them voted for erdogan . 
  i highly doubt the ones who 're insulting to him are the people who voted for him . 
   eu citizens do n't have free visa travel in turkey pretty much every single eu nation has visa free travel to turkey . 
   `` let 's stick to the criteria we always apply because only then we will be credible to our own citizens and the turks . '', 
  i 'm sure malaysia and uae totally meets all the requirements since they already have a visa-free travel to the eu . 
   the point now rather is to make clear that visa-free travel for turkish citizens into the eu will not happen any day before mr erdogan leaves office . 
  uhh ... 
  sorry the burst your bubble but it 's already decided that it 'll happen when turkey fulfills all the requirements and resignation of erdogan is n't one of them . 
  man erdogan shut the fuck up when this refugee crises ends we 'll be again discarded as a cheap whore . 
   i do n't think any human , regardless of what they have done , deserves that . 
  no there are plenty of humans who derserve that and this monster is one of them . 
  this sub-human killed 80 kids imagine you 're being one of the parents would you still say the same ? 
  he does n't deserve to interact with another human casually for the rest of his life ... 
  really ? 
   process suspended ? 
  why waste time ? 
  just deny them . 
  they 're kids they can be taught about these things . 
  why did you even take them in if you 're are n't even giving the slightest effort to integrate them ? 
   are you telling this serious ? 
  mamy hardcore muslims i lived my entire life in turkey . 
  surrounded by muslims every shape and never in my life i came across to someone who refuses to handshake with the opposite gender . 
  not even once ... 
  if you even refuse a simple handshake you should probably leave ...

  [ turkey hosted 200,000 refugees ] ( http://english.alarabiya.net/en/news/middle-east/2015/01/26/turkey-opens-biggest-camp-for-kobane-refugees-.html ) ** only ** from kobane siege , 60,000 returned after kobane secured . 
  rest still in turkey . 
  some european countries going nuts over 20,000 refugee ** by 2020 ** , we hosted 200,000 just from one siege of war . 
  so , what im supposed to see here ? 
  edit : numbers, 
   imf , nato , eu , un , germany , australia , france , spain do not . 
  if you wan na list countries , here , [ full list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_naming_dispute#naming_policies_of_foreign_countries_and_organisations ) with a [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/macedonia_naming_dispute.svg ) . 
  red - former yugoslav republic of macedonia green - republic of macedonia blue - unknown gray - no diplomatic relations so majority calls republic of macedonia , if that matters . 
  russia cant prevent nato intervention in syria , maybe iran , but they wouldnt risk it . 
  also , you can always go with `` its against isis ! '', 
  argument , and create * buffer zone * / * safe zone * in isis areas , dont forget that nato is already intervening syria by using isis excuse . 
  also : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_supervision_mission_in_syria / https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/u.s.%e2%80%93russia_peace_proposals_on_syria, 
  okay , if he wants to involve nato , why not just start a * peace keeping mission * ( or * buffer zone/safe area * ) by un ( if un cant , by nato ) for refugees ? 
  currently , all he wants is to push problem out of europe , to turkey . 
  why not aim to stop problem ? 
  do people really think turkey is happy with refugees ? 
  * `` but its closer culture !, 
  '' * yeah you have no idea what youre talking about . 
  [ yes its not ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/plates_tect2_en.svg ) . 
  also , [ cyprus is rightful ~ ~ turkish ~ ~ asian clay ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/europe_asia_transcontinental.png ) but no one argues if cyprus is european or asian . 
  all depends on how do you define a continent . 
  the scientific way ; europe is part of eurasia . 
  historically , ural mountains / caucasus mountains / turkish straits , which still makes cyprus outside of europe . 
  so , is it not arbitary now ? 
  you know , more than 10 million people ( recorded ) lives in turkish europe . 
  thats more than some european countries , and its 1/8 of population . 
  also , i forgot to mention , that turkish europe bigger than some of the europe countries if that matters . 
  `` not arbitary '' yeah sure . 
  i didnt even notice you were mod here , lol . 
  messaged admins , thanks anyway .

  the main difference between bulgaria and greece is , greece has shitton of small to big islands in aegean , which many of them is really close to turkey . 
  migrants arent using land border but sea . 
  and as long as you are in greek territorial waters , and ask for refugee status , they cant touch you ( if they obey eu laws/refugee conventions ) . 
  and if they dont , its really easy to document ( again , really really close to turkey , and frontex patrols ) , which might lead to different consequences compared to bulgaria . 
  but you know that turkey related things are posted here even before this . 
  if you argue agaisnt that ; if you think that this post doesnt fit subreddit , just report it or send a modmail ; no need to start a discussion . 
  okay , i didnt say anything against that ( and same can be applied to this post too , you know , fits the rules ) ; but you seem to obsessed by term `` european '' , so i suggested that sub to you . 
  then continue posting on / r/european , easy , right ? 
  fyi , / r/european is a seperate subreddit ( and you already know that ) . 
  / r/europe has a map on top-right side , and that map includes from cyprus to armenia . 
  `` this is not / r/eu either , why cyprus is included ? '', 
  because , this is / r/europe . 
   third one is the same with the subtitled one . 
  i meant the length of video . 
   you assume an attack based on allegations of a fisherman out of a video that 's shit . 
  so refugees decided to use last chance to swim , since theyre in aegean sea ( best sea ) ? 
  lol actually i found 3 version of video , that was the longest one , i used that . 
  [ third one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=123nt5d174k ) . 
  i rewatched first video , they assume that coast guard popped boat at 0:22 , since they see a refugee in water . 
  boat is behind the ship , off screen . 
  okay , let me try again . 
  you can see ship in 0:46 ( first video ) . 
  this ship is gray ( or light blue , its hard to distinguish ) , [ turkish ships are all white ] ( http://www.sgk.tsk.tr/baskanliklar/harekat/platformlar/platforms.asp ) . 
  turkish ships either has turkish flag or red marking . 
  this ship does not . 
  since its captured with an old phone , its hard to distinguish whats writen on ship . 
  * ' [ helenictic coast guard ] ( http://www.hcg.gr/ ) ' * website  english is broken ( for me ) , i dont know if they have ship list ( i couldnt find it with google translate , at least ) . 
  so , i searched it on google , and closest i could find is [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/hellenic_coast_guard.jpg ) , but i dont know . 
  dont you think a planned propaganda video ( or conspiracy ) would have better phones ( to capture video ) , a copy/clone of greek ships with really clean greek flag ? 
  they could capture ripping apart part too . 
  heres full video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qigigkptmhg he starts capturing after greek coast guard `` pops '' boat . 
  he didnt expect a coast guard ship to attack refuuge ship i guess , why would he randomly capture a video ? 
  you can see refugees dropping to water , do you think they decided to swim to land ? 
  hes swearing to coast guard ship , really , really heavy in turkish . 
  if it was turkish coast guard , they would stop after swearing . 
  oh , it must be some conspiracy or propaganda against greeks , right . 
  [ rt ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/312594-greece-migrants-boat-sinking/ ) [ telegraph ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/11803114/greek-coast-guard-deliberately-sunk-migrant-boat-in-turkish-waters-fishermans-film-alleges.html ), 
  i dont know either , most likely right-wing people here or greeks trying to hide it . 
  but well , whatever . 
  translation ? 
  because , in video i cant see turkish coast guard ( i mean how can i know it without flag or sideview ) . 
  and the photo they shared is directly from [ here ] ( http://www.sgk.tsk.tr/baskanliklar/harekat/en_platforms/platforms/sar33.asp ) ( i thought it was taken after video ) .

  i dont know if / r/europe ever had platform pool or stats , but i do believe pc users with css is majority . 
   to be honest , i do n't think that the default 5 report reasons that reddit gives are really all that useful . 
  you can change them . 
  for example / r/dota2 and / r/globaloffensive has custom report choices . 
  start from here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraqi_kurdish_civil_war and youll find more relevant links in this post . 
   your leadership made a decision to attack the pkk now ( ... ) a shift in the security situation that makes it easier for erdogan to end your democracy . 
  it does n't seem to be beyond him . 
  lets ignore that pkk attacked first ; after announcing ceasefire is over because turkey is building dams and security stations ( lol , yet they cry about isis passing border freely ) . 
  how convinient that they happen to attack right after ( same day ) isis attacks turkey , and trigger turkey to start operations against pkk ( `` hey , isis attacked turkey , lets use this chance to trigger attacks against us ( pkk ) , turkey-senpai notice us ! '' ) . 
  also , how funny that they announce that ceasefire is over ** after ** hdp gets into parliment , while their reasons for ending ceasefire ( announced ones , dams and security stations ) was a thing even before that . 
  they couldnt wait hdp to ask for whatever they want , for some reason . 
  its like erdogan is leading pkk , all they did was help to erdogan . 
  thanks , pkk / s,

  maybe you would know if you read the article ? 
  you sound like a pleasant human being . 
  where did he imply they were gon na pray to mary 's statue ? 
  i swear how can you guys talk about stuff you do n't know jack shit with this confidence ? 
  are you joking ? 
  mary has a massive place in islam . 
  she is literally described as the greatest woman ever lived by quran . 
  damn dude greeks would have very shitty reputation if we drew standards based on you . . 
  i doubt i saw a single decent comment in this sub by you . 
  it is normal to not know shit about something but constantly trying to make comments about it while being ignorant is just pathetic . 
   not ditib alone . 
  teachers are brought into position by the turkish consulate . 
  ditib is helping by sending those imams to schools into religious class . 
  and they somehow teach history in religion class and slander europeans and non-muslims ? 
   we still have a religion class in school . 
  for 1-2 hours a week they learn something about their religion . 
  teachers for this class are brought in place by turkey -  indoctrination of children . 
  lmao dude do you honestly remember anything from your religion class ? 
  be honest i sure do n't we had 1-2 hours a week in turkey as well . 
  kids do not give a shit about religion class no matter what 's told in them you are just pushing agenda by denying reality . 
  plus there is a thing called curriculum are you saying your country is so incompetent they are unable to stop teachers telling how bad germans and christians in literal classes ? 
   that may be true . 
  but did i say that ? 
  you literally claimed they indirectly support terrorism when they did more to prevent it in europe than any other organization do i need to say more ? 
   the thing they do is preaching whatever ankara is telling them . 
  oh really and have you even listened to any of them or is that what the stuff you read claims ? 
  i am not muslim anymore but i have been to ditip mosques when i was in germany and all they read is shit about brotherhood and how you should make-up with people you are angry with or how charity is good , being angry is bad bla bla bla ...  they get their complete preaching text send from ankara . 
  which is the whole point . 
  it prevents imams from preaching their own bullshit instead all mosques read the same script and it 's almost always some story of mohammed being charitable and kind and some shit . 
  it keeps imams in check because ditib will know if they said something else other than what it was given to them . 
   pure turkish propaganda basically . 
  yet you do n't have any examples dude i do n't know what shitty news you are reading but i were you i would stop . 
  like what do you think mosques are ? 
  how can you do `` pure turkish propaganda '' while talking about how muhammad gave a coin to some random dude on the street ? 
  to this day only actual propaganda they did was calling people to vote in the referendum and elections and as i said that should have no affect to you guys . 
   no by separation of the turks in germany from the german population by supporting the formation of subcultures . 
  there is nothing wrong with subcultures humans are diverse beings . 
  just by being muslims they are already a part of a subculture ditib only makes them practice this subculture more easily . 
  integration is about mutual acceptance not forcing everyone to be united under one identity and culture . 
   turks learn german like a foreign language and are teached in entirely separated classes . 
  do they speak german as good as the next guy ? 
  yes . 
  then what is the problem here ? 
  there is nothing more normal than wanting your ethnic language to be your first language . 
   most turks in germany are more pro erdogan then turks in turkey . 
  this is the simple reason . 
  not true . 
  most turks in europe do n't even give a fuck about erdogan . 
  i mean come on dude how hard is to check the numbers ? 
  most german turks who vote for the election in turkey vote for erdogan most do n't even vote because they do n't care which is perfectly reasonable . 
  for example in the last referendum % 46.22 of the german turks voted % 63.07 voted yes . 
  so if we use this as reference . 
  % 29 of german turks are pro-erdogan . 
  not so much now huh ? 
   but a the country 's biggest islamic organisation has said it would not take part in the demonstration which it said amounted to an `` assignment of guilt '' which was in danger of splitting german society . 
  seems like a valid reason . 
  do you see americans or europeans doing marches everytime their operations cause a massive civilian casualties in middle-east ? 
  no ... because it has nothing to do with them it is not their fault they should n't feel guilty simply because of who they are . 
  they do not need to go outside and say `` i do not support this '' why should muslims do it ? 
  the march sounds like those `` white guilt '' marches . 
  plus you need to have a serious lack of awareness to call muslims to demonstrate in ramadan . 
  you expect hungry , thirsty people to demonstrate all day ? 
  btw ditib organized the one of the biggest anti-terrorism rallies in germany calling them terrorist supporters for not endorsing this rally is moronic at best . 
   they are indeed . 
  this group is owned by turkey and used to indoctrinate german turks from school on . 
  lmao what ? 
  ditib has schools now ? 
  just get out of here you start spewing bullshit from the second sentence . 
   they tell turkish children in school how bad and wrong we are . 
  also their very special version of history . 
  again where ? 
  are you implying germany is n't a secular country and their education is taken over by religious organizations ? 
  that 's a rather big insult to germany . 
   up , the imams funded by this organization are preaching the same bullshit . 
  they go as far as saying `` vote erdogan '' . 
  ditib 's imams are the main reason why turkish muslims in europe are not radicalized like arabs . 
  why are terrorist attacks by turkish muslims almost nonexistent compared to arabs despite being the biggest muslim community in europe ? 
  it is thanks to the ditib mosques having strong measurements against radicalism . 
  they might be pro-erdogan and call votes to them but that 's our problem not yours criticize facts not make up bullshit . 
  ditib has nothing to do with terrorism in europe . 
  they are operating for years yet have you ever heard of them ever calling for violence ? 
  or was there ever a scandal in one of their mosques being a radicalization center ? 
  no ...  turkey also supports various terror groups . 
  so yes , indirectly they are terrorist supporters . 
  yet you can not name them are you trying to be taken seriously or not ? 
   and a major factor why integration of some turks into german society goes very slow . 
  how ? 
  by building mosques ? 
  only thing slow here is you my friend . 
  i swear i hate erdogan and especially hate european erdogan supporters but this slander is just plain ridiclous . 
  ditib mosques known to be the best and cleanest ones in europe . 
  if you want to be concerned about something be concerned with suadi mosques that literally call for terrorist attacks on plain sight . 
  if chp did n't vote for that there would be no chp right now . 
  you underestimate how much pkk is hated in this country . 
  there is no faster political suicide than looking like you are siding with pkk . 
  hell chp 's short-lived cooperation with hdp already cost them enough harm . 
  even in the worst case scenario we are not completely lost . 
  erdogan is the guy who ties everything together there is no successor who can claim his cult of personality . 
  he 'll die eventually he is not really young and everything he did will be reversed because his supporters will split just like secular folk are . 
  look at the elections prior to 2002 we had a lot more colorful maps back then .

  the aegean dispute is a thing and people are totally oblivious to it the whole time . 
  3-4 violations is nothing , crossing the owned area in water is very easy and not a big deal , getting right over land is where it gets problematic , the way the russians did . 
  most people are unaware and do n't care . 
  it 's not a big uproar or anything . 
  right , thanks for the explanation man . 
  really ? 
  what happened ? 
  last i checked erdogan loved serbia for some reason and wanted to really invest there and i never got why ... what 's going on ? 
  his face in panel 2 and 3 just crack me up the artist did a great job . 
  this was also very funny and revolves entirely around erdogan and i can really get behind that . 
  erdogan is someone that believes any publicity is good publicity , he also just does not care . 
  it was not an issue though . 
  there is no conflict going on what conflict are you talking about ? 
  also greece invades turkish airspace too but that is completely overlooked by you guys for some reason , always taking one side and ignoring the other . . 
  i 've never ever heard of the italians invading turkish airspace , can you show me some evidence to this ? 
  the cyprus thing was never an issue until cyprus ' admittance into the eu though that 's what i 'm saying . 
  according to what turkey signed , turkey is not violating greece 's airspace because the agreed airspace that turkey signed on was 6 nm and turkey flies above that but under 12 nm which is what greece is now claiming . 
  also italy ? 
  what ? 
  and how are the airspaces even relevant ? 
  cyprus was n't an eu member before though . 
  eksisozluk is turkish reddit pretty much . 
  if they banned balkava and lahmacun the people would turn rabid , that shit is crack cocaine to us and we 're all addicts . 
  there are n't that many people here that use reddit from turkey and all this will do is make the site inaccessible for the few who do use it . 
   i live in new haven , there is no persian community ... but thanks for dismissing my opinion through a string of baseless assumptions . 
  who are the ones thinking persian kebabs are the best if there are no persian communities to have the kebabs from ? 
   i 'm sorry if a turk saying their kebab is the best does n't convince me . 
  you guys have a tendency of putting forth that opinion about everything , and it 's been baseless more often than not . 
  go ahead and have some in turkey then , i guarantee you 'll also be eating your words . 
  the meat in turkey is just delicious and the specialised kebabs of the regions are far superior of that of the persian kebabs . 
  yes i 've had them and no i 'm not being bias , i 've liked some of the other ways our food is produced more than the way we do them like uzbek manti is better than ours and bosnian burek i prefer over ours , but persians ca n't make kebabs better than we can . 
  hello colony :d now be careful and do n't start claiming our food as yours like the rest of our ex-colony does : dd, 
  shawarma is actually also turkish kebab , shawarma is literally a turkish word and is just a synonym to doner . 
  they both mean to spin/to turn . 
  hey at least he was honest and stayed with a turkish name !, 
  our kebabs are actually better than the persian ones . 
  in turkey we have a very long list of types of kebabs and they 're certainly much better . 
  you 've probably only really had persian kebab and have such an opinion cause of all the persian restaurants cause of the large iranian population in usa . 
  i 'm guessing especially in the area you live in . 
  they did but in turkey there is n't too much of a pizza culture though there are similar things to pizzas in turkey that 's why kebab pizzas are n't found that often , it still exists but it 's not widespread . . 
  currently the name of turkey in turkish is t\u00fcrkiye , however i 'd like to drop the greek suffix on the country 's name and use the turkic suffix and rename the country t\u00fcrkeli . 
  that might be because you associate it with the bird . 
  if the country was named anatolia maybe you 'd be calling the bird anatolia . 
  besides the name sounds better in turkish than in english . 
  what an annoying bot, 
  i think the local bird population is fine , i learned a lot about it in primary school but ca n't remember much now but i believe have a lot of birds of many different species and we 're also a transit hub for migration . 
  do n't quote me on this i could be totally wrong , i 'm only trying to remember from many years ago so ... you can search yourself though . 
  i really like that !, 
  for those who do n't know , in turkey we have tons of strays in the street , including stray dogs and they 're both taken care of by the people of the neighbourhood . 
  the municipality also takes the animals , gives them their shots , tags them and then drops them off where they were picked up . 
  personally i really love the system , it makes me sad how in other countries they are impounded and then killed if no one takes them ... 
  let 's not forget the turkish van cat which almost always has [ heterochromia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/turkish_van_cat.jpg ) and also these cats [ love to swim ] ( http://purrfectcatbreeds.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/turkish-van-cat51.jpg ),

  everyone 's aware of the streisand effect here and it is posted multiple times in every thread about erdogan vs the german comedians . 
  actually this is pretty much what german law states is illegal . . 
  most european countries seem to have those laws but we get singled out due to confirmation bias stuff and people seem like they want to talk shit about us . 
  yes but we do , this was posted 50 times in every thread so far , at this point it has been a karma ride to post it . 
  we insult erdogan every day . 
  my grandmother spits at him every time she sees him on tv . 
  ( not actually spitting but an insulting tuh ! ), 
  beautiful !, 
  it makes me feel that nice sort of early morning calm just looking at it ... what is the meaning of torun ? 
  are n't you just heavily bias then if you hate turks and islam so much ? 
  to me there is a difference ... also theres 8k out now , i 'm excited about that !, 
  that 's our business . 
  if you do n't have a 4k screen you 're not going to see what it really is though . 
  we do n't let things like that get us down or else the terrorists win .

   what for ? 
  actually it 's because we really need those islands . 
  i live on the aegean/mediterranean coast and i can see greeks islands from my house . 
  * they are so close yet so far . 
  this actually sounds like what a nationalist government would teach to kids . 
   i dislike late ottoman empire and hate some of their actions especially how they became pious after egypt 's conquest . 
  they could have forged an alliance with golden horde and mamluks since both were ethnically turkic ( mamluks were turk slaves brought to those lands and later rebelled ) i doubt any of them gave a fuck about turkic-ness . 
  babur , timur , safavids , qajars etc were turkic too but here we are . 
  his argument was that rome had already changed religions once ( thus `` byzantium '' being the second rome ) so the third rome would be muslim . 
  bullshit , you were modding / r/european a while back but i think you 're shedding your racism a bit . 
  what a dumbass . 
   fucking up the balkan ... the place was changing hands left and right all the time . 
  ottomans stopped the constant warring . 
  pax ottomana bitches, 
  also europeans were so scared they literally went around the world to avoid the ottomans . 
   darkness literally . 
  but i like being a hairy demon :(, 
  `` the world is their canvas and countries are merely colors on their palette . '', 
  interesting how it 's called `` fall of constantinople '' in the english wiki and `` conquest of \u0130stanbul '' in the turkish wiki . 
  also almost forgot this : allahu ekber, 
  also ultrafrench, 
  clone white people , duh . 
  by the way you fucking coward , stop using throwaways . 
  it 's pathetic that the answer you 're looking for is `` anything but living with non-whites i 'm for . 
  automation ? 
  whites having more sex ? 
  wat do ? '', 
  you need to um , harvest the sweat . 
  that would be really wasteful . 
  i was told police officers are valid targets so these are n't terrorists . 
  not even a spy , we literally have no idea who that guy was . 
  he could even be from tunisia or something for all we know . 
   it is not known where the agent is being held at the moment . 
  it 's straight up fabrication . 
  it 's a kurdish nationalist website and ...  a source asking to be anonymous whoever upvotes this is falling for it . 
  his grandpa was probably a nazi , i would be careful with that . 
  exactly the same with turks but i do n't see the purpose of that song at the end there , seems a little dramatic .

  okay but how was that relevant also, 
  how is this relevant to what i said ? 
  / r/forwardsfromoma, 
  but what do you mean, 
  fucking cyrus is giving in to the semites, 
  bullshit , we only send gypsies and syrians . 
   they actually believe that eritrea will suddenly decide to comply with human rights obligations n only two days . 
  they do n't , that 's the problem . 
  they will always rationalize being `` the bad guys '' because it will shatter their moral superiority and ego if they do n't . 
  a condescending piece of garbage was the best thing they could come up with as an excuse . 
  i mean come on , a nice strong takbir out of that hymn would 've been amazing . 
  mostly the awkward aftermath . 
  awesome !, 
  i hope more is done to drop gender rules in ie languages . 
  get with the times . 
   '' we hope for two good days in eritrea with great conversations . 
  we expect that the eritreans will increasingly comply with human rights . '' i still do n't get why they do n't just drop these pathetic lies and say `` we do n't like you '' and be done with it . 
  contrary to popular belief , black people are n't coming to eat you . 
  he said that one could not be muslim and secularist at the same time because they were polar opposites and that only allah has supreme authority ( rather than the people ) .

  i can not think of any other reasons . 
  only `` alamanc\u0131 's '' i 've interacted with were the german teachers i 've had and i think they diverge from the norm just by graduating from university . 
  first of all , this is about turks who live in europe but still support erdo\u011fan . 
  their situation is different that turks in turkey . 
  for your post ( and turks in turkey , if i understood you correctly ) , of course this is n't the whole thing . 
  economy argument , persucution argument and all others are all part of a huge number of reasons . 
  there are real islamists in turkey who ** do ** want to see women in garbage bags and all that shit . 
  there are akp voters who do n't buy into government bullshit , with their own reasons for voting akp . 
  but in my opinion ( maybe i have too much faith in people ) i think their early economic success is the biggest part of their political success . 
  got ta admit , i think it 's a funny joke . 
  maybe meral ak\u015fener as president ? 
  conservative enough for some akp voters , previously mhp and chp has no one else . 
  they probably choose it because of both it 's meanings . 
  it 's pretty hard to find something in dutch meaning something else in turkish . 
  also i realize i am being harsh when i say  when you make blanket statements to circlejerk about how shit turkey is . 
  everyone does this . 
  / r/turkey is practically a circlejerk subreddit . 
  it 's just , everyone should be a bit better , everyday . 
   when they come back to visit their backwater villiges , they too notice differences . 
  after listening to their grandparents about how there was no electricity back then , they see people with iphones and mobile internet . 
   it 's especially worse with them because they do n't notice the petrol they pay 5tl is actually more expensive than in germany where the purchasing power is 4 times higher .

  the reason i 've spent this much time writing this is n't to show `` how free turkey is . '', 
  there are clear problems .

  the reason i wrote all this is because when you make blanket statements to circlejerk about how shit turkey is , you strenghten the authoritarian hand .

  cumhuriyet is still going though . 
  there is a reason why a single party does n't rule continuously in democracies . 
  they start to fuck up and lose support . 
  erdo\u011fan gained his current support because of large economic growth until 2008 and not getting fucked by '08 crash ( it 's debatable if he is actually responsible for the economic success or was just luck but i 'm neither qualified to talk about that nor have the time to discuss it . ), 
  what i hope is people start to see how things are going to shit with him .

  everybody involved needs to be firm , but reasonable . 
  the opposition here and foreign countries . 
   the amount of media outlets who is not pro erdogan is very low compared to those wo are pro erdogan . 
  the media outlets who are against erdogan do n't exist anymore . 
  as someone who does n't speak turkish , follow turkish media or could n't list 5 turkish media outlets , how are you to make that judgement ? 
  it 's correct that akp propaganda outlets are * far far * more prevalent , but this is n't something i pull out of my ass . 
  i can check atv 's viewership or look at how do\u011fan media reacts to government pressure . 
  that does n't mean media against erdo\u011fan does n't exist anymore . 
  i can make this judgement because i can actually consume turkish media . 
  this is the nuance that gives the argument against erdo\u011fan validity . 
  when you say '' the media outlets who are against erdogan do n't exist anymore . '',

  however it 's nice to see europe has the same amount of retards as our own country . 
  this thread was an eye opener for me . 
  sad to see the liberal western world so willingly eating up such obivious propaganda attempts . 
  can you show me one woman who wears bukinis who would support your assumption ? 
   weird how akp government was all nice and friendly with the cemaat until the latter started exposing their corruption . 
  then suddenly , they 're a terrorist organization . 
  and we are cracking down on extremist islamist organizations who incite violence and hate speech , as opposed to muslim organizations . 
  exactly . 
  so why are you acting like these fuckers being arrested is a bad thing ? 
  you 're so focused on erdogan that you failed to see other evils . 
  before erdogan there was gulenists before him there was nurcus . 
  these people have been pain in the butt for years and finally they 're getting what 's coming for them . 
  what 's wrong with being okay with this ? 
  erdogan crimes is well known to all of us and he will pay for it eventually . 
  however that does n't mean i 'm gon na start agreeing with every crazy who opposes him . 
   if you do n't understand the difference between islamists and muslims , no wonder you support erdogan . 
  i have never in my life supported erdogan did n't vote for him , hate him and his guts and would throw a party if he died tomorrow but i also hate cemaat . 
  gulen and erdogan those fuckers are the biggest threat this country ever faced . 
  their alliennce did too much damage to this nation but now their infighting is  and if we 're going to discus terrorist organizations : i do n't see erdogan cracking down as much on isis . 
  and just when i thought you knew some stuff you return to your ignorant self . 
  for the last few years everyday isis supporters and members are getting arrested . 
  literally one google search will prove it but ofc research and reading is hard for people like you . 
   even worse , he arrested and punished turkish journalists who revealed that turkey send isis arm deliveries in a secret trial . . oh my god how ignorant can you be ? 
  what the flying fuck ? 
  the deliveries were going to syrian rebels not fucking isis can d\u00fcndar never claimed that it was going to isis and locations the trucks were caught was in hatay . 
  google it if you do n't know where that it . 
  it 's kilometers far from turkey-isis border . 
  also you do n't even know that the court sided with can d\u00fcndar and erdem g\u00fcl got no sentence . 
  it 's sad to see that you 're an enemy of reading ... 
  the human race does n't advance fast enough because of the likes of you . 
  you guys talk first read later and spew your ignorance to everywhere . 
   hell , today even germany , turkey 's closest european ally , condoned erdogan for actively supporting islamist terrorist organizations . 
  again you 're spewing your ignorance because you only read the title and not the article . 
  i really feel sad for you because you do n't seem to be someone stupid ... 
  nothing is fucking leaked what the germany interior minister published was common knowledge or outdated that erdogan himself does n't even deny . 
  now let 's see what that report said : it starts with saying that turkey supports muslim brotherhood which is n't recognized as a terrorist organization anywhere except russia and some middle-eastern countries . 
  muslim brotherhood was an islamist party in egypt and it was democratically elected until they were overthrown by a coup . 
  i guess siding with democratically elected government is wrong huh just because they 're islamists ... 
  when does west stops supporting suadi arabia again ? 
  let 's see what else got in this report . 
  hamas ... hamas had a fucking office is turkey it was no secret that turkey supported hamas until turkey and israel made up now . 
  now [ hamas is expelled from turkey ] ( http://eajc.org/page32/news53438.html ) . 
  sad to see germany interior minister is this incompetent that he ca n't even validate his report properly . 
  and lastly the report said we support islamist organizations in syria . 
  well no fucking shit erdogan makes speeches about it all the time how assad is crazy dictator and how opposition is right . 
  everybody knows that the rebels are islamists and we 're not alone in this support . 
  usa and france supports them as well do n't see anybody accusing them of supporting terrorism however ... 
  curious huh ? 
  however there is rumors of a flip because of the recent dealings of erdogan and putin so let 's hope it 's true . 
   please tell me how the fuck an air hostess or a university student are responsible for a coup which only lasted one day ? 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  no university student or air hostess is arrested . 
  also how slow are you ? 
  did you not read that this was a crackdown towards cemaat not just coup plotters ? 
  you do not need to be directly involved with the coup . 
  after the terrorist attacks in europe did those countries just arrested the guys who did the attack ? 
  wow look at france . 
  they are done with all their problems and what 's left is banning a clothing that 's only worn in beaches by a minority in the country . 
  you aware that cemaat is declared a terrorist organization in turkey since 2015 right ? 
  why is west arresting islamists then ? 
  why is islamist mosques are being raided ? 
  is n't that also religious discrimination by your logic ? 
  i never claim only coup plotters were being arrested what i claimed is only cemaat members are being arrested not gulenist supporters or erdogan 's political opponents . 
  huh ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  erdogan did have prior knowledge of it ... that 's why the coup has failed . 
  it was going to happen in 3 am where everybody is sleeping but mit discovered it early so it had to be rushed otherwise they would get arrested in the morning and doing a coup at the most busy hour in turkey is a bad idea unless you ready to massacre the entire population . 
  congratulations france you stopped islamic terorrism . 
  the burkinis were the culprit !, 
  except that you have no idea what the fuck are you talking about . 
  ever heard of zaman ? 
  zaman was the biggest news media in turkey until it was taken over by government for being gulenist . 
  by your logic millions of people should be arrested for subscribing to an known gulenist media . 
  then there is gulenists charter schools . 
  even i went to one . 
  it both gave you normal education and promoted gulenism by giving special islamic lessons they even made you read gulen 's books . 
  millions of people went to these . 
  there is also bank asya the gulen 's bank that mainly used by gulen 's supporters . 
  as you can see there are millions of gulenist supporters in this country . 
  yet only 38k people arrested why ? 
  because we 're arresting the members of cemaat not everybody who supports gulenism . 
  second part of your comment is even worse you 're ignorant about what 's going on and gulen movement that you obliviously claim that arrested judges and academicians are innocent . 
  gulenist judges is pretty fucking well known . 
  they fabricated evidence and convicted our kemalist officers in balyoz and ergenekon trials . 
  gulenist academicians are also known . 
  you seem to not even aware how cemaat operates . 
  cemaat is not some isis like organization . 
  they give actual education to their people so they could infiltrate to critical parts of country and gulenist academicians are crucial for the organization because their goal is to make sure that their fellow gulenist youth is getting good grades . 
  they even stole the answers of general university entrance exam . 
  you do n't know how big cemaat is do you ? 
  yes and now the number is down to 38,000 and only 17,000 them is facing trial . 
  here 's a tip kid reading will save you from future embarrassments like this one . 
   well , gulen and gulenists are erdogan 's major political and ( reputedly ) ideological opponents . 
  no they 're not both have the same ideology which is why they used to be allies against kemalists back in the day . 
  the diffrent is erdogan and his party is elected gulenists on the other hand tried to take over by force . 
   even though there 's barely any evidence gulen was behind the coup there are so many evidence that 85 boxes of evidence is being sent to usa . 
  thousands of testimonies , proves of coup plotters being part of cemaat , confessions ... etc. . . 
  it 's basically confirmed that it was gulenists who orchestrated the coup but i guess what you guys want gulen himself coming and saying he did ... do you guys think he 's an moron or something ? 
   erdogan was quick to blame it on him and his followers , setting off the largest purge the country has ever seen in the most direct and authoritarian way possible quick ? 
  for days we thought it was an kemalist coup just like the one against adnan menderes it took days for it to be confirmed that gulen was behind it .

   when did i do this it was n't you sorry , it was the first person i replied to . 
  but the way you replied to my comment had a condescending tone , as if my intention was to sound smart . 
  i just stated something i think to be true . 
   i come from an island that was 252 under the ottomans fair enough , but the bulk of greece where the majority of greek people lived were under ottoman rule for much longer . 
   intermarriage between christians and muslims was prohibited i 'm not saying you 're wrong , but what 's your source on this ? 
  turkish rulers had a thing for european women , most of which were christians . 
  would n't surprise me if they were hypocrites but it 's the first time i 've heard that christians and muslims could n't marry . 
  also , you seem to imply that christian and muslim populations did n't mix - regardless of the law you mentioned , it is a fact that there was interbreeding between the two populations all over eastern europe . 
  it 's the reason why many of us have such white features . 
   probably stems from the fact that turkshave assimilated slavic peoples that 's true , but it does n't explain why greece has such low percentages . 
   but at no time in history did anyone come and exterminate the people of greece . 
  you 're right , but combine the fact that many greeks migrated to modern greece from anatolia and the fact that turks settled in greece hundreds of years ago , and you 're bound to have a pretty mixed population . 
  i 'm sure there are y-chromosome maps that show which one of us is correct ? 
  maybe we should look into that . 
  i 'm willing to admit that i 'm wrong if that 's what the genes say . 
  i asked for a source that shows more greeks were killed than replaced . 
  it 's not a justification . 
  nobody says it is . 
  it really frustrates me that even when i mention that we suffered also , someone like you has to tell me this does n't justify what we did . 
  i never said it does . 
  but here 's the source of the massacres of turks in the balkans : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims specifically the russo-turkish war killed hundreds of thousands of turks if i recall correctly . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-turkish_war_ ( 1877 % e2 % 80 % 931878 ) my grandparents were persecuted in bulgaria , and escaped with their own means . 
  my grandma tells me stories about it all the time . 
  she used to speak fluent bulgarian , she was just like any bulgarian except she was a muslim . 
  edit : 200,000 turks killed in bulgaria , 1.5 million had to flee . 
  if this is not a genocide or at the very least a massive , brutal massacre , i do n't know what is . 
   trying to change history  appear smart on reddit wtf are you saying . 
  your comment is plain dumb , listing middle-east and balkans as ethnicites . 
  for the most part of history ( past 500 years ) greeks and turks lived together in what is today greece , but also in modern turkey , especially in cities like izmir , istanbul etc. 
  sure if you go to the east of turkey you 'll see greater admixture , but eastern turkey is n't very significant in population size . 
  you 'll be surprised to know that greeks have lower percentages of blue eyes/light hair in their population than turks do ( i 'll post my source if you do n't believe me ) . 
  that stems from the fact that modern greeks are ethnically anatolian to a great extent , just like the turks are . 
  you have to remember that greeks were n't the only inhabitants of modern greece and modern greece is n't the only country greeks inhabited . 
  it 's not laughable to compare this to turkey . 
  many turks have been massacred both in greece and in the balkans . 
  nobody likes talking about them , but they happened . 
  it seems like people here believe turks are incapable of being victims . 
  most of this is population exchange . 
  let 's look at how many turks lived in greece in those days and how many live there now . 
  source ? 
  that 's not how it 's looked at when they look at our history though . 
  how is that funny, 
  the greeks set houses and buildings on fire as they were retreating . 
  they contributed significantly to the destruction of izmir . 
  you just conveniently left that part out , because only the evil turks commit such acts and we 're to blame in every situation . 
  you 're also a mix of many ethnicities , just as much as we are . 
  hurts to even see them side by side, 
  america is acting like a douche to everyone else also . 
  when will people like you realize that hurt feelings do n't matter nearly as much as you think in the real world ? 
  practically all of eu and western nations in general supported and praised erdogan in the early 2000 's while the secular turks were screaming on top of their lungs where this guy would take turkey to . 
  it was n't until much later that the west finally caught on . 
  pretty much haha, 
  so you 're arguing turks are non-european because of their `` asian origins '' , then when i tell you that hungarians also have similar origins , your argument switches to religion and fighting turks . 
  and your sentence about decent people being decent while others are vile , i do n't think even you know what you 're trying to say . 
  what about hungarians ? 
  at the very least , the inhabitants of istanbul are european . 
  they were born or at least live in europe . 
  many of them have ancestries from europe . 
  we 've been secular and liberal for so long , and only in the past 10 years it has been causing us trouble ? 
  we were way ahead of our times in terms of equal rights for women , abortion , homosexuality , secularism , you name it . 
  we do n't need to be in the eu to amount to something . 
  which one of our neighbours poses a threat to us ? 
  with the exception of iran which is pretty much off the table nowadays , each one of our neighbours are significantly weaker than us in terms of military power and size of economy . 
  our neighbours bulgaria and greece are n't islamists , syria has believe it or not a secular constitution and assad has defended secularism for a long time , even iraq was semi-secular not long ago until the american bastards arrived . 
   near future says future actually , point blank . 
  so does mine, 
  fair enough , i 'm just pointing out why his comment makes no sense either way . 
  and how does one join a continent socially/politically ? 
  europe is a diverse continent and you can not attribute any one value to it . 
  oh right , i know how this goes . 
  everything good = european , everything bad = middle eastern . 
  how does one join a continent ? 
  such a dumb and empty comment . 
   erdogan wanting to make masjid attendance mandatory at universities source ? 
  i hope and think you 're not right . 
  beautiful clip . 
  wished it was longer . 
  that 's arguable, 
  that 's not about being fought against , that 's the fact that even today people use symbols of turks ' heads on swords . 
  i asked why they do n't speak up, 
  lots of comments under this thread , which specific one . 
  i do n't expect western europe to defend us . 
  they can stay out of this . 
  if the u.s. was n't poking their nose into everything , we probably would n't have this situation anyway . 
  but the distinction here is the people of western european countries and america and their governments . 
  it does n't surprise me americans want to defend their allies more than western europeans , and that 's nice of them . 
  but the government of the u.s. is just messed up ( just like my own government ) . 
  pulling out soldiers from the middle east is n't that difficult . 
  nobody forced obama to fund terrorist groups like al-nusra either . 
  the problem in syria developed while obama was in the office . 
  he inherited much of the problems but he created much of them . 
  they 're all murderers guilty of many crimes against humanity . 
  the u.s. government is no more innocent to me than any other party in syria . 
  what i ca n't believe is how the whole world lets this happen . 
  at least western european countries have some dignity and decency , why do n't they speak up ? 
  of course he 's responsible . 
  the u.s. government is responsible for much of the mess we see in the middle east today , including syria . 
  i said i was n't gon na respond but i have to call you out on one thing : do not ever compare the situation of the dutch who got kicked out of a foreign land to the turks who were born and raised in the balkans , spoke the local language and were perfectly integrated . 
  my grandparents were among those who got persecuted and chased out of their homeland , all their properties seized and their rights revoked . 
  again , clearly you can not accept the fact that sometimes we , turks can also be victims .

  so are a lot of syrian refugees children . 
  but since mostly grown men can manage to travel that distance to europe majority of them you see are grown men . 
  otherwise refugee camos in turkey and jordan are filled brim with children . 
  litetally everyone that knew shit about libya and syria repeatedly said that if west supported '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' `` moderate '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' rebels , things would get much , much worse . 
  and now both syria and libya are in civil wars . 
  majority of syrian populace are behind assad as under him they wo n't get killed by insane jihadis and will have a modicum of stability . 
  but instead west just supports enslaving psychopathic jihadis and then dares to talk abou how it 's somehow middle eastern peoples ' fault . 
  there are close to 5000 still living in turkey though , especially in istanbul and islands in marmara . 
  greek living outside of greece are called romans in turkish . 
  when turks arrived in anatolia , byzantine greeks called themselves romanoi . 
  the turkish word for greek , which is yunan ( from ionian ) did not refer to greeks until 17th/18th century , and even today , cypriot greeks and greeks living turkey are called rum , which is turkish version of roman . 
  so if you enjoy being calles roman , it 's pretty good . 
  that glorious eastern europe aesthetic . 
  he is also one of the most cited economists in the world . 
  it looks so cheesy . 
  do anyone in balkans get along ? 
  for those who may not be able to access the site for whatever reason : the turkish economy may collapse in a couple of years if politicians do not show the west that the economy is trust-worthy , daron acemo\u011flu , professor at the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) , told the daily h\u00fcrriyet . 
  `` economic growth comes from consumption and consumption is encouraged by loans . 
  this is not sustainable . 
  we have very little time left . 
  the building has not collapsed yet , but it can . 
  there might be a crisis , '' acemo\u011flu said . 
  `` this may occur in the next one or two years , '' he added , indicating that turkey still attracts short-term foreign capital , which allows narrowing the current account deficit . 
  however , this might change when turkey has difficulties to take out loans to pay off its debts , he said . 
  the election of donald trump as the president of the united states is speculated to cause foreign capital to be withdrawn from turkey , and in trump 's presidency , interest rates are expected to increase , and the rise in interest rates would cause foreign capital to be withdrawn from the turkish market , acemo\u011flu warned . 
  `` the positive image on turkey still remains . 
  but they [ foreign capital ] are gradually being withdrawn . 
  this is why the u.s. dollar has gained value [ against the turkish lira ] . 
  if the interest rates rise in the u.s. , which is expected to in trump 's administration , the withdrawal of capital will accelerate . 
  we have to get our act together before this happens , '' he said . 
  `` in the long-term , we have to show the west that our economy is developing . 
  because foreign money comes in by virtue of the reports they give . 
  we are shaping our foreign policy by our domestic politics . 
  this is not good , '' he added . 
  acemo\u011flu added that economic development is highly correlated to press freedom . 
  `` for long-term development , transparency , openness , comprehensiveness and competitiveness are crucial . 
  it is very hard to provide that in places where there is no press freedom . 
  then , the possibility of monopolization , corruption of the judicial system , and the emergence of dictatorship escalates , '' he said . 
  acemo\u011flu is optimistic on social change in turkey . 
  `` the infrastructure and economic modernization are way ahead of where they were in the 1990 's . 
  right now we are more developed and are a more open society . 
  despite the situation of the media and rising authoritarianism , turkey is more open than before . 
  it accesses the outer world via social media . 
  the horizon of the ideas of the turkish people is wider . 
  there are things to be hopeful about for the future , '' he said . 
   `` lost '' he only failed to reach % 50 . 
  otherwise he got the mpst votes . 
   if the economy tanks , his supporters will no longer stand behind him . 
  good luck buddy the economy has been tanking for several years now . 
   and saudi arabia like that will ever happen lol . 
  is n't saxony like alabama of germany ? 
  you can get virtual any law you want into turkish senate . 
  does n't mean it 's supported or it will pass . 
  it 's not just about campaigning though . 
  with majority of electoral base being super populous metropolitan areas , candidates will focus on issues concerning them , instead of also concerning rural populations . 
   you can mail in a bailout or go before or after work . 
  is n't this only in certain states ? 
  lol , it 's not hard to bring a bill into the senate in turkey . 
  important and hard part is getting it to pass . 
   not european among other things mkay . 
   that_guy_313 nvm it 's you again . 
  yeah , i confused nato as eu . 
  oh yeah , i misremebering it as nato , my bad . 
  no , but it would certainly make it easier . 
  additionally 15 highest population metro areas in us equal to % 35 of the us population , and most populous 40 equal to close to half . 
  a similar scenario would also happen with more standart systems . 
  around % 35 of us population live in metropolitan areas , new york metropolitan area alone consist of 25 million people . 
  lown turnout in american elections has more to do with american political system in large being a steaming pile of shit , not just the electoral system . 
  it also has to do with the fact that election day in america is apparently not a holiday . 
  retarded does not mean illegitimate . 
  the entire argument would go anything beyond incessant whining if electoral college was not known beyond a single candidate . 
  also claiming that clinton won if us only decided with popular vote is stupid , since there are a lot of republicans in highly blue and red states that did not vote too . 
  that argument would have a basis if clinton did not knoe about electoral college but trump did . 
  both of them were aware of * nuances * of electoral college , and yet trump won since he was able to better * game * system than clinton could . 
  it might be stupid , however complaining at this point is largely baseless . 
  again , he is not trying to change them now . 
  general turkish public , including akp voters are against accusation of land from middle east , since in general turkish people dislike arabs . 
  also iraqi kurdistan is not a threat to turkey . 
  erdo\u011fan wants to have much more influence on iraqi kurdistan , who largely aligns with him and a preferable alternative to ypg/sdf . 
  he also wants to assist iraqi kurdistan to increase his already large kurdish voterbase , which equals to around half the kurds in turkey , despite west 's ideal vision of `` feminist , vegan , secular , gluten-free '' kurds , majority of kurds do n't want secularism . 
   turkey invaded again and did the massacres that allegedly was trying to prevent . 
  oh yeah , let 's forget the fact that literally the first thing junta did was to siege a turkish population center and kill and rape hundreds of turks . 
  but it 's okay when greeks do it . 
  erdo\u011fan entered syria because he does n't want a kurdish state other than iraqi kurdistan than in it 's borders . 
  that 's why , you know , he only entered when ypg captured manbij . 
  also when turkey entered cyprus the first time , there was a geniune threat of massacre of turks there . 
  you are pretty naive if you think his intervention in syria has anything to do with lausanne . 
  they 'll be reworking it forever since even a good chunk of akp mps are against the bill . 
  he fully prefers laussanne . 
  in fact , he is not serious at all here . 
  he is just saying this to pull the attention away from the fact that turkish economy is about to crash . 
  it did n't pass though . 
  erdo\u011fan of all peoplr withdrew the the bill before it could even be talked in the parliament . 
  something huge is happening already . 
  tl is losing value and crashing like twin towers . 
  in a matter of 2 weeks we went from 18th to 20th economy of the world . 
  majority are expecting an economical crisis/market crash and government has virtually no idea how to combat this . 
  ireland is different than turkey in many ways . 
  turkey wanted to became a member of eu since 70s the same way you may want to become a billionaire . 
  sure , being a billionaire would be very nice , but you are not willing to show the effort to become one .

  the difference is even deeper in groceries , fruits and vegetables , etc. 
  in turkey , those are really really cheap , compared to europe . 
  yes , but again , it 's about money . 
  i love to drink , but as a student , i really ca n't , when i 'm in europe , i ca n't buy as much food as i can in turkey , but i drink like there 's no tomorrow . 
  also , that 's average , i wish we could have a statistic that averages out of the people who drink . 
  if 90 % of the dutch drinks , in turkey , it 'd probably be around 50 % . 
  these are the main problems , but there 's no problem in easiness of access to alcohol . 
  i can buy it anywhere . 
  i could buy it anywhere when i was 16 , and i did n't look older . 
  it 's normally illegal to sell after a certain time , but still , practically i could buy any time . 
  not much about demand , even if only 50 % people that are of age would possibly drink , that 'd be 25 million people . 
  it 's more about taxes . 
  and yes it 's easy to get , nearly every supermarket have it and most of the groceries are actually liquor stores . 
  we would have it cheaper , if there were n't enormous taxes on alcohol . 
  but still , you can find cheapest beer in markets for about 6 liras for 500 ml ( efes pilsen ) , which is about 1.5 euros i think . 
  czech republic was much much better at prices . 
  this article has a very poor translation of erdogan 's words though . 
  sultanahmet has artistic importance and all that but think about , as a royalty , praying in hagia sophia . 
  you 're basically a roman emperor , which ottoman sultans claimed the title of . 
  it 's a political decision , rather than religious . 
  it 's islamist wet dream to turn it into a mosque again . 
  it 's not erdo\u011fan . 
  secular people of turkey knew about and hated the cult of g\u00fclen for much more years than government . 
  g\u00fclen cult was not a secret thing then , for example police academies of turkey was one of the places where % 90 of its students and teachers were gulenists . 
  private schools were openly supporting gulen cemaat . 
  people were n't secret about their support . 
  the only difference was , back then akp government supported them . 
  they were openly complimenting g\u00fclen cemaat , there are videos of every big government person saying good things about g\u00fclen . 
  they came to this place by supporting each other . 
  they infiltrated military , purging kemalists out of the army ( see ergenekon ) . 
  the guy above is not believing erdo\u011fans lies . 
  there are a lot of innocent people purged after the coup , there are a lot of gulenists purged as well . 
  when you accuse turkish people here about believing erdo\u011fans lies , just remember we hate him much more than you do . 
  just to be clear , i do n't support purges . 
  they 're not legitimate because they are done with executive orders and there are lots of innocent people as well . 
  but demise of the gulen cemaat is a good thing , just like demise of akp will be in the future hopefully . 
  are you in tallinn ? 
  i 'm going to go tallinn for erasmus next year . 
  tell me if you want some rak\u0131 or coffee or anything :d, 
  well , kurdish seperatism in 1920s was mainly about religion though . 
  kurdish movements of that time were first wanted sharia law , then kurdish natioonalism . 
  you know that in 1914-1915 , mustafa kemal was in gallipoli , right ? 
  yeah but the young turks became an idiomatic impression in english . 
  they do n't directly take the name from the young turks , they take from the english phrase who took it from jeune turks . 
  if there 's a civil war , new immigrants will mostly be educated secular turks though . 
  just like iranians in revolution . 
  the akp supporters accuse / insult us as being byzantine , crusader . 
  but it depends on the region . 
  for example black sea coast which was pontus , is one of the most religious , conservative places in turkey and there are lots of people who are greek descent there ( they even deny it ) . 
  % 40 in red , 60 in blue . 
  yes but the president has only 2 terms and when he does this , he loses one of his terms . 
  % 60 live in blue . 
  just calculated it . 
  blue ( no ) provinces have 48,276,989 people . 
  which is the 60.5 % of the country . 
  yeah i thought it was an honest error as well . 
  i do n't think there 'd be anyone in r/europe that would do that mistake . 
  i was joking :d, 
  they really look like mhp supporters , many \u00dclk\u00fcc\u00fc girls i 've met has the same style ( clothing , hairs , etc. ) . 
  i do n't know why they are so passionate about this though . 
   other arabs incl the turks and iranians triggered . 
  turkish word musakka is a very different dish than greek moussaka . 
  yours is lasagna like dish while musakka is a casserole . 
  moussaka is much more delicious , there are dishes in turkey that are more similar to it . 
  one of my grandmother is greek , and the other one is central anatolian and i could say , difference between greek and western anatolian or even central anatolian cuisines are not bigger than difference between anatolian and southeastern/eastern dishes . 
  it 's even worse , considering 1876 constitution of ottoman empire was heavily influenced by constitution of belgium . 
  way to go turkey ... 
  his health will not allow that . 
  hopefully . 
  no way to know i guess because state does n't count the divisions of islam officially , so i do n't think there 's an official number , but it 's estimated to be around 12 millions . 
  in the past there was open violence against them by the fascist turks , since alevis are mostly left voters . 
  i think in urban populations it does n't matter that much now , especially in istanbul there 's lots of alevis . 
  some sunni people do n't let their children marry with alevis and vice versa . 
  ( in rural places , people still marry with their fathers/parents ' consents or even perform blind weddings . ), 
  cemevis ( worship places of alevis ) are n't officially recognized by turkish diyanet , which is the main political topic of alevis . 
  most alevis in turkey vote for chp and i believe there should be a lot of alevi mps in the party as well . 
  erdo\u011fan in the past , when talking about k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu , start the sentence by `` as you know he 's an alevi '' like he 's insulting him . 
  sorry i was on mobile . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jxuidkbxg4 ) 's a newer version of that . 
  a kemalist march from the turkish war of independence about \u0130zmir . 
  it 's de facto march of kemalists against erdo\u011fan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jxuidkbxg4, 
  5.8 % of the words in turkish are borrowed from arabic , that is a total of 6467 words . 
  in turkey , there are no vending machines for those products but most places let you buy drinks if you 're older than 14 and do n't look that small . 
  minors drinking or smoking is not something people approve of , but it 's also not a big problem . 
  buying cigarettes are much harder , but generally you can find someone to get to buy one . 
  again , if you look somewhat older than your age , for example when you have a beard , you can buy anything easily . 
  police raids on bars happen especially when the place is shady , they ask for ids if you look young , but they do n't penalize it . 
  migros or carrefour usually . 
  to me , it 's because right-wing extremism uses much more far-reaching , populist ideals that most people in the society can relate and so they are much more dangerous . 
  i mean just thinking about my country for example : right-wing extremism is mostly done in the name of `` political islam '' . 
  left wing extremism has created some terrorist organizations . 
  seeing the country as what it is right now , i can definitely say that islamists harmed the country much more than the left . 
  they made turkey what it is right now . 
  i get it . 
  how do you pronounce tepes by the way ? 
  so as i understood , vlad done bad things too but what he did was for justice and national defence and he has so many good things done , so he is praised as a national hero ? 
  it is not late , i asked it because i was curious , thanks . 
  i loved that poem so thanks for that . 
  i wonder what changed your mind about vlad in that book . 
  i will take a look at it but what exactly ?

  edit : an organization is made in china , the people in the organization start several firms and open bank accounts for them . 
  they make fake bills and go to the banks to turn them into real money . 
  the money goes from the chinese banks to several banks in turkey , most importantly halkbank . 
  the money is withdrawn and taken to the orient bazaar , some of it is turned into gold . 
  they are brought to airports in turkey , joined with gold directly from ghana , back to turkey and from here to dubai where they are turned into money and again gold . 
  from there to tehran , where they are turned into both money and gold . 
  meanwhile in iran , some fake exports from the fake chinese firms are sent to different banks and accounts . 
  `` leaders '' in iran give reza sarrab some money , he exploits and distributes the money , sends it back to turkey . 
  ( i think . ), 
  ** turkey ** * [ a corruption scandal ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25514579 ) : i probably wo n't get all the details . 
  to simplify , there are two powerful groups in the current government , the conservative akp people and the religious g\u00fclen people . 
  the g\u00fclenists have decided to abandon akp and reveal the corruption . 
  a famous construction-sector millionaire , several ministers ' sons and the husband of a celebrity were arrested . 
  the [ scheme ] ( http://cdncms.zaman.com.tr/2013/12/20/harita2-b.jpg ) involved banks , iran , oil money and 87 billion euros , some found hidden in a shoebox . 
  police found money-counting machines in their houses , and such . 
  the chief executive of a major bank was also arrested . 
  of course for the first few days the media tried to downplay it , then a few ministers resigned . 
  one did it live on tv and asked erdo\u011fan also to resign , since he was the main man and everyone apparently had his consent . 
  he also said that erdo\u011fan was pressuring his ministers . 
  then the interior minister resigned , after he sacked many police officers and solicitors . 
  that night , erdo\u011fan renewed his whole cabinet ( including egemen ba\u011f\u0131\u015f . . ) a republic solicitor ( not sure how to translate that ) made a declaration where he said the evidence and the files had been taken from him . 
  also the police refused to obey court orders to arrest more people in a second wave . 
  * someone stabbed a balloon santa . 
  * an earthquake south of antalya , it did n't do much damage except scaring people . 
  * the lira 's exchange rate went down badly , 3 for an euro and 2,10 for a dollar .

  what ??? 
  we study ottomans for a long time , like 60 % of the history lessons are ottomans and the other part is ancient anatolian civilizations and ww1 . 
  or is this sarcasm and am i missing it ? 
  we also study moldova a little with romania , and i do n't remember stephen iii 's name probably because they are all referred to as prince of x , king of y. . . 
  something must have gone wrong in translation ... 
  the general word for citrus fruits is narenciye , so at least we got that right ? 
  well , in turkish it 's called portekiz , how did you miss that ? 
  though i guess the absence of - gal would n't really count, 
  ** turkey ** * in 2004 the pm , the national security council and others met and decided to end the influence of g\u00fclen 's movement . 
  a journalist published these decisions recently in the g\u00fclenist newspaper taraf , and this week the government requested criminal action against the journalist . 
  a newer report from taraf shows that the government has profiled employees of the national intelligence organization by religious sect and monitored their activities .

  ( also , the university exam system changes once every few years . ), 
  it is basically impossible to go to a good/average university without spending at least 2 years in these prep schools . 
  some are controlled by religious groups , some not . 
  due to the disagreement between erdo\u011fan and the g\u00fclen movement , it has been proposed that these prep schools be closed . 
  this is ridiculous , until the schools are better or the exams are fairer they have no right to shut them down.the prep schools are an indirect tool for the argument , it seems , and the students have to bear the inconveniences . 
  with the end of the argument , the prep school thing seems to have also been forgotten or cooled down .

  you just drew them by limiting the rule to two genocides . 
  what about algeria ? 
  native americans ? 
  ottomans in the balkans ? 
  what about evidence for those ? 
  it just seems like `` rules for the sake of rules '' and what do you think `` denying genocide '' means ? 
  a simple `` it did n't happen '' ? 
  not even neo-nazis say that . 
  they just make shitton of excuses . 
  is that allowed ? 
  you ca n't create a rule for every scenario . 
  yeah i get it .

  all media is biased . 
  folks like you are like robots who think they have free will . 
  they got you thinking pkk abandoned terrorist tactics so there is that . 
   has pkk claimed responsibility for this ? 
  terrorist organizations who want to keep a good rep in europe are not known for claiming responsibility for dead children and civilians . 
   is this state-terrorism ? 
  i do n't know . 
  did turkey claim responsibility for it ? 
  the sources are mostly from the west . 
   they have also renounced and abanadoned terrorist tactics in turkey and abroad they have ? 
  that 's what your unbiased media sources are telling you ? 
  why they continue doing them then ?

  oh how peaceful secularist and feminist freedom fighters they are . 
  i love folks like you who think they got everything figured out . 
  well , he 's dead now . 
  that was quick . 
   what i meant to say is that whether an organization is terrorist or freedom fighters depends on context and outcome of its struggle no . 
  people name armed organizations as terrorists or freedom fighters solely based on their ideology , which nationality they are killing , and which nationality the organization is composed of . 
  that 's how it always been . 
  this is turkey . 
  every kind of fuck-up is possible . 
  dhkp-c ( the people who are doing this ) are stupid as much as akp .

   ottomans only gained entry to the balkans thanks to a huge earthquake nice excuse bro . 
  we have low standards . 
  the standards i consider while voting in turkey boils down to `` excluding akp , had the biggest vote percentage in the last elections '', 
   there are far more muslims than buddhists in turkey , and probably as well at that uni  this has become a fight against a certain political agenda and not for a buddhist temple thank you captain obvious . 
   no need to be all anti-islamic ( or as they call it in turkey , atat\u00fcrkc\u00fc ) atat\u00fcrk\u00e7\u00fc does n't mean anti-islamic . 
  but akp ass lickers love to associate atat\u00fcrk with anti-islamism . 
  this what akp supporters think the other governments and coups did . 
  a lot of people vote for akp because they think the opposition will ban islam and kill muslims in the name of glorious secularism or whatever . 
  this guy is probably a turk from germany who has no idea how things work in turkey .

  rightful demands from my buddhist brothers and sisters :  i ca n't practice my religion , the closest buddhist temple is 2000 km away so i ca n't go during lunch breaks . 
  -  i also want a satanic temple . 
  -  for freedom of religion , all temples should be built . 
  for example , when i 'm playing civ 4 i choose free religion and make sure all temples are built and happiness skyrockets . 
  -  if we want our country to be a world leader in terms of science and education , we should build religious buildings across all of our universities . 
  yes , you heard it right .

  library ? 
  buddhist temples are the only solution .

  because your vote is already counted in `` 2 '' .

  [ turkish demonstrator confuses the dutch tea with french .

  edit : http://imgur.com/a/x6v8i nestl\u00e9 , you 're next !, 
  no , but apparently she is emine 's favourite actress . 
   to be honest though , inonu supporting the coup and military made him an easy target for islamists . 
  yes . 
  to be honest it was a very hard decision , i presume . 
  inonu could either stay silent about the junta 's activities or trust menderes and make the junta public . 
  which would presumably followed by a purge of officers in the military and arresting of the opposition . 
  i think it 's hard to trust menderes when there is a [ committee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/committee_of_inquest ) in the parliament whose mission is to control chp 's `` dangerous activities '' . 
  if there was no coup , chp was favorable to win the next elections , but if the `` coup attempt '' was made public , menderes could gain votes because of it . 
  the primary mistake was not preventing the executions of the government officials . 
  he did try to prevent by sending letter to the coup leaders , but if he had defended them publicly , officers would have no chance but listening to him . 
  and he would maybe be remembered as a democrat . 
  same as inonu . 
  successor of ataturk . 
  he was the right hand man of ataturk through the independence war , signed lausanne treaty , lead the nation through ww2 , allowed greater democratization and liberalization after the war . 
  none of his reforms or actions are or have been supported by the people and for a very long time islamist people scapegoated him to criticize kemalists , since they could n't attack atat\u00fcrk publicly . 
  i 'm not saying inonu is the best , i do n't support most of his actions too , but he is not that bad , especially when you look at the late turkish politicians . 
  yes , turkish secularism is directly influenced by the french . 
  almost all intellectual movements in turkey is directly influenced by the french . 
  we call it `` laiklik '' in turkish , from `` la\u00efcit\u00e9 '', 
  it could be that , but it could also be our mental understanding . 
  the person who made this image is most probably ( 99 % ) learned to write right-to-left first . 
  maybe a person whose mother language is arabic would comment on that better though . 
  also rise of political islam in turkey takes it 's roots from us-turkish governmental efforts of countering ultra-nationalism and communism . 
  in my experience , ( my experience is not radical muslims , but regular muslims ) people tend to think of good parts of islam , when they think of islam . 
  so you can ask them if they want to be ruled by islamic law . 
  if they say yes , it does n't mean they would want harsh punishments for non-muslim people , taxes for non-muslims etc. 
  they would n't even think of punishment types like stoning , beheading , etc. 
  they think `` those are the products of their time ( 600s ) and we should n't use the historical applications of the religion word by word , we should update them with contemporary life-style and knowledge '' ( not update the religion , but update the application . ), 
  on the other hand , i think there 's a really fast radicalization of religious people and akp supporters , without even control of akp . 
  using fear and victimization every day , will be very bad for our country someday when all of them are getting out of their hand . 
  i think these borders ( and other limitations comes with sevres ) would only lead to a turanist-fascist government to emerge just like germany and they would be allies of germany in wwii . 
  and then it would be `` liberated '' by soviets and turkey would be a communist/red state like most other eastern european countries . 
  not in normal circumstances . 
  i mean whoever wins this referendum , results will be very close . 
  so you ca n't arrest % 50 of the population . 
  also votes are secret and people are generally respectful of each other 's democratic rights on voting days . 
  there are radical people who are n't but i 'm speaking of general public , without any party affiliation . 
  in some rural areas , disputes between voters happen but that is more common in local elections . 
  it exactly means `` woman that is aged beautifully , got prettier with age '' . 
  so it is n't much different than `` to be aged like wine '' in english . 
  usa was the superpower of the world in 1970s .

  only people serving their sentence can not vote during their imprisonment .

  it tells the details of political discussion inside turkey about ww2 . 
  they were of course scared that nazis will attack turkey , and they were more scared that , if nazis attacked , soviets will `` save '' turkey . 
  from 1941 nazi-turk non-aggression pact to battle of stalingrad , nazi sympathizers in turkey make turkey really close to joining the war on axis side . 
  ( and inonu must also consider the chance of nazis taking down russia , so he can not go full against nazis . ), 
  also it 's strange to see so many nazi sympathizers in ankara during the war . 
  according to deringil , nazis had a great network of spies ( mostly turkish ) in ankara and they were doing propaganda against western powers . 
  these guys were hoping by allying with germans , after russia has been defeated , nazis will give turkey the turan lands . 
  there were parties thrown in ankara after every nazi victory , with fireworks and stuff . 
  cumhuriyet was also a nazi sympathizer back then .

  we probably do n't want to admit that we were really close with germany even though we were allied with britain and france . 
  and this book is a great read all around . 
  edit : i assumed you know turkish , so i linked turkish version of the book , but for everyone interested , here 's a rather expensive [ english version . 
  ] ( https://www.amazon.com/turkish-foreign-policy-during-second/dp/052152329x/ref=asap_bc?ie=utf8 ) highly recommended . 
  read hitler-in\u00f6n\u00fc letters , even they talk about germans and turks fighting together in the last war together and not wanting to be enemies this time . 
  so they talk about it like that too . 
  no but , he 's saying `` seeing fascism in rotterdam is mad '' not `` turks are mad , for seeing fascism in rotterdam '' . 
  there is no need to make a blanket statement , when instead you can focus on the problem . 
   if most of turkish people are ok with this then who we are to complain ?

is it true that i will be shot by a random dude with an m16a4 if i do n't order enough big macs ? 
  `` they are also genociding kurds and the pkk is fighting for their freedom . '', 
  i hate / r/worldnews, 
  thanksgiving much ? 
  there is a similar disagreement about different kurd-related flags here . 
  they are used by terrorist organisations . 
  so if you put one up at your house , are you showing support for the terror groups that kill people , or are you just being part of your nation like any other nationality would with their flag ? 
  i personally think that the flags are okay in both cases . 
  every country has done bad stuff , so if we started to avoid flags we would soon run out of flags . 
  hmmm what do * you * think about being such an asshole to somebody who is trying their best ? 
  do you think it 's worth the hype ?

   i just have a hard time seeing kurdish violence as unjust . 
  i could understand attacking tsk because this is the government that they are fighting . 
  but instead , they build car bombs targeting civilians in ( ironically kurdish-majority ) cities . 
  this is never justified in my opinion . 
  i mean , i hate erdogan even more than they do . 
  but i would never voice this opinion by killing 30 random people who probably do n't even support him . 
  if i went further i might go and attack an akp campaign office , but never random people on the street . 
  during the independence war after ww1 we did n't put too much effort into liberating the rest of the ottoman empire . 
  the rest of the middle east stayed under british and french control and they got their own nations later . 
  now i wish we had all of that oil money . 
  and under secularist policies there would probably be much less conflict there today . 
  every country . 
  so can i just say `` european union '' ? 
  okay turkey is different from the rest of europe in that nobody wants turkish citizenship . 
  i do n't blame them . 
  they have to serve in the military ( ie fight in syria ) in exchange for the right to vote in an election . 
  and it would be bad to be considered a local during the next erdopurge . 
  i think you would get more answers on / r/iwantout . 
  most people there are americans in europe . 
  but from a turkish perspective , the americans living in turkey are great people . 
   how well have you been able to `` fit in '' they will always stick out ( turkish is a hard language to perfect ) , but not in a bad way . 
  nobody would be racist against them , and instead people will be interested in what it 's like living in the us . 
   do you see yourself making a life in the country you reside in what do you mean ? 
  they need to get a well-paying job in order to get a visa . 
   what do you think of the politics of where you live ? 
  the americans and other people from the west are very anti-akp . 
  but it is very rare that they attend protests . 
  the ottoman empire :d if you want a more serious answer : france . 
  first , i am going to say that i 've never done this . 
  i 'm just pointing out how some other people do . 
  -- a lot of turks are pretty nasty in the youtube comments . 
  look at the comments of any popular english-language video involving turkey , greece , cyprus , or armenia ; i guarantee you will find some good stuff if you scroll down far enough . 
  they get into arguments with people from almost all of our neighbours . 
  my favourite is when they write `` k \\* rt '' because they are implying k\u00fcrt ( kurdish ) is a swear word . 
  and then the other side responds by writing `` t \\* rk '' ( t\u00fcrk , or turk/turkish ) . 
  that 's fine . 
  i 'm also worried . 
  but my point is that he is very predictable . 
   unpredictable ** how to predict the turkish president 's next move : ** 1 . 
  what is the situation ? 
  what is the logical solution to the situation in number 1 ? 
  find the opposite of number 2 . 
  this is what reis will do next . 
  see , he is actually very easy to predict . 
   kill turkey or russia . 
  nothing personal , turkey . 
  why turkey ? 
  i want to kill russia , too :(, 
  fuck : greece :d kill : russia marry : azerbaijan, 
  i 've never seen anything like those pictures , but we have our own way . 
  people like to hang flags like [ this ] ( https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/3344c7ad-1312-45d8-869d-80d846fded9a.jpg ) on their balconies and windows . 
  sometimes they get a really big one ( i ca n't find a picture ) that covers some of the windows of the apartments below . 
  if you are in the apartment underneath , it is a really shitty situation to be in because - you ca n't ask the neighbour to remove the flag because he will not . 
  he might even report you to the security services for not wanting this flag . 
  - if you try to get the authorities involved , maybe one day a police officer will come by just to say `` what problem do you have with this flag ? 
  do you hate your country ? 
  stop wasting our time . '', 
  - you ca n't take the flag down yourself because you would be in deep shit if you are caught . 
  i know this from experience :( i was powerless for a month until they forgot about whatever they were celebrating/mourning . 
  we already do that , mostly . 
  in the eu there are large legal trade barriers making it easier to just trade within the union . 
  in turkey it 's much cheaper to just make stuff here .

  kurds are my friend , they are my fellow citizens . 
  however you can not sustain your argument pulling the subject without knowledge of the background of the conflict . 
  pkk is not a peaceful organization . 
  they are terrorists killing civilians and military personnel and rightfully labeled as many international institutions . 
  erdogan was the man behind that truce and the man that broke it . 
  this conflict and many failed truce efforts precede erdogan . 
  pkk is pkk and this conflict is their purpose of life . 
  all truce efforts ends up being broken because they can not cease to exist with their economical and local power gains and be done with it . 
  check your facts . 
  it is founded in 1974 . 
  you do n't have to take my comments seriously as i do n't take yours . 
  edit : please google or research your facts . 
  this conversation is being more and more pointless . 
  i wo n't go on with this if i 'm talking to a solid wall . 
  you are a terrorist sympathiser , just read about the conflict from every kind of source till you get enough knowledge about it 's history . 
  do n't digress the subject . 
  pkk is a terrorist organization and responsible for tens of thousands of murders since 1970 's . 
  this has nothing to do with erdo\u011fan or isis . 
  pkk is a terrorist organization and it 's sympathisers are terrorist sympathisers . 
  because more than 30.000 people have been killed over decades . . 
  most of us do n't give shit about erdogan . 
  hehehe ... 
  is n't it obvious ? 
  either we will go to europe or you . 
  time will tell . 
  not to ridicule you but when people smell gas that reminds some of us , people shouting mein f\u00fchrer with hand gestures . 
  of course this is in no way needs contemplating , but you ca n't hear anybody say it is connected when something happens to any jewish person . 
  however , i think neo-handgesturingpeople transformed their actions to more of finger gesturings while pointing them at people who deserve no hate with each unrelated happening . 
  which is the case , nostradamus . 
  it still is not confirmed until he wants to believe it . 
  do n't bother . 
  however , humidity and temperature creates an ideal environment for bacteria . 
  i get what everyone is saying , but they are only focusing on sterile urine . 
   fluidy body parts like our warm humid genitals neighbouring shit holes . 
  do you even read ? 
  still your fluidy body parts contain incomparable amounts of bacteria that should not be shared with others . 
  also you flush the toilet , touch the door knobs while you are there . 
  in addition , you can wash your hands before as well , if you feel them dirty . 
  he replied to temple of hephaestus link . 
  that 's greek . 
  we were talking about the pantheon in rome not the parthenon in athens  i love that one too . 
  yes they did n't , as pantheon was different 2000 years ago . 
  however , marble covering and fa\u00e7ade organization do not compare with pantheon 's architectural qualities . 
  pyramids are wonders with their construction techniques and organizations . 
  it would be illogical to compare them this way . 
  but it is still debatable which one is more fascinating . 
  [ pantheon 's dome ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/pantheon-panini.jpg ) was the pinnacle of structural engineering at that time , weighing 4,535 tonnes with a 9 meters hole ( oculus ) at it 's most critical point . 
  here is why i think 2000 year old pantheon is more fascinating than 4500 year old pyramids . 
  * pantheon stayed at the top of engineering list of the world for centuries , for it 's architectural qualities , construction techniques and structure . 
  however , pyramids are one of the most basic structural presences ( literally man-made hills ) , while their construction techniques and in-situ engineering are fascinating . 
  it is a wonder in terms of construction and organization , but not for it 's architectural qualities and structure . 
  * there are older and smaller pyramids with uneven shapes . 
  an earlier example is the [ bent pyramid at dahshur ] ( https://nilewavetravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_4262s.jpg ) . 
  this pyramid was started at one angle but about halfway , the angle was changed to a steeper one . 
  this is a major miscalculation led to a catastrophic failure , but that pyramid still succeeded to sustain for nearly 5000 years . 
  * the pantheon however , could never live up to this day with even a minor miscalculation . 
  the existence and geniusity behind of it was a breakthrough at first the day , let enduring 2000 years . 
  it 's engineering qualities , construction techniques are still used today and will be used for many centuries it seems . 
  even computer aided designed contemporary buildings , like sydney opera house , have problems with their age today . 
  * what gives a wonder architectural value is that , we still keep learning from the pantheon . 
  pantheon is a 2000 year old book , which will be teaching people for thousands of years about architecture . 
  while pyramids are more like books strong about egyptian history but weak in engineering , which american documentaries love to speculate ( and shitpost about with dramatic music ) . 
  this is why i think , pantheon is hundreds of times more fascinating than pyramids in terms of architecture . 
  i would n't put pyramids and greek temples in the same category . 
  one is basically stacks of stone , while other has columns , beams , ornaments and most importantly superstructures like domes . 
  do you even follow cyprus or are you just here to make noise ? 
  those questions are self explanatory . 
  it is not about sentimentality i think . 
  a romanian brand targeting it 's country and neighbours . 
  dacia 's target market has not changed with the acquisition by renault . 
  in addition , bigger market share brings convenience and resell value , which adds on continued sales , exceeding sentiment after some point . 
  sounds like a german/turkish centre-back football player written that way . 
  brb ... ... is this enough ? 
  from the cyprus or thread ? 
  [ here is the document in question . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ivgrarr.jpg ) translation :  bah\u00e7elievler provincial directorate of national education   to all public-private school and institution administrations   the complaints to the directorate show that , there are activities not related to the legislation , lessons and social activities , far from our worthy judgments , encouraged and directed by the students for some celebrations , . 
  students might be able to put different perceptions according to their economic situation ; ( such as gifts of christmas , pine ornament , etc. ), 
  under the name of fun , chance game , lottery and new year , which will prevent the classes due to term and year end and will encourage students to different habits and negative behaviors . 
  i would like to declare that there are no activities to be made that could affect them in a different way and that there is no opportunity for an error . 
    emin \u00c7\u0131kr\u0131k\u00e7\u0131  provincial director of national education so , this is not an order specifically for \u0130stanbul erkek lisesi , but all education institutions fall under this provincial director . 
  [ irrelevant to this event : here is a news report about istanbul erkek lisesi students protesting newly appointed pro-akp school director by turning their backs and applauding . 
  i mostly agree on your points , but europe needs to see turkey with it 's deeper layers , not just erdogan and his supporters . 
  most active population in turkey is against erdogan . 
  this is why erdogan is constantly fighting with academics , economists , corporations , artists , journalists etc. 
  education and prosperity is a no-no for him . 
  he is being fed from poor and uneducated population . 
  europe 's condemns , warnings or reports do not even reach there . 
  only erdogans food and clothing coupons reach that frozen twilight zone . 
  religious schools , repressed intellectuals , diminished secularism and democracy just widens the zone . 
  the further europe pushes turkey , the more erdogan settles in the swamp of philistinism . 
  and pkk is happy to play between these dynamics and fasten the anti-erdogan belts . 
   dont come crying when erdogan ** unleashes the syrians ** on you . 
  goode olde democratic vegan feminist freedom fighter racism right here . 
  you are all fucking hypocrites and killers . 
  this comment section alone shows why turks offended and heartbroken against the eu . 
  europe can not have a single moment of unconditional good faith for turkey . 
   you may not agree with a country 's politics ... and even europe condemns such attacks time to time , it becomes a laughing matter among their pkk supporters . 
   it 's funny how every attack on turkish people is `` terrorism '' and how europeans bow their knees , but when nato country turkey killed more than 1000 civilians in less than a year everything is ignored . 
  you just show your imperialistic true colours . 
  terrorism only can be committed against nato , and every nato country committing huge massacres and genocide is ignored .

  in fact most of the time the reality is they feel jealous when they see a local girl with them brownies . 
  did you even read the article , yourself ? 
  because it is . 
  : ddd, 
  : ddd would be awesome if it was antakya . 
  serves well , dick place :p . worked there for 2 years . 
  probably it goes with the official city name hatay . 
  i mean there were always religious turkish nutjobs who prefer islamism over secular turkey and we have been dealing with them since the establishment of the republic but with the erdogan and his neo ottomanism , hearing these kind of ideas is more prevalent and vocal among the population . 
  but regular folk who preaches this bullshit is mostly after some personal benefit who just says what is mainstream power right now . 
  if the narrative is more nationalistic or secular or etc. 
  in the future , you can bet that these people will change their political stance like they are the bastion of these beliefs . 
  sorry for the late reply . 
  i really do not want to translate the lyrics since they are gibberish bullshit . 
  but the main motive is ottoman revival and bringing caliphate back to turkey and also he is talking against the guys who attempted for the coup . 
  for example : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjecu6t_qiu the guy is extremely idiot and ottoman wannabe and of course erdogan sucker . 
  ahahahha please continue , please . 
  did not downvote a single comment of yours . 
  and also a guy who does not know how to read . 
  mate , you made my day . 
  afraid to burst your bubble mate ; you are not michelangelo , da vinci or hack not even orban . 
  all you do is spouting arrogant nonsense on reddit . 
  lmao delusion is real in this guy . 
  replied me with the same answer twice ? 
  proving your kinda europeans extremely boring and again unoriginal . 
  lol . 
  soo , turkish you mean . 
  must sucks being bad at easy math then . 
  do n't believe we are europeans . 
  but you still are not original . 
  extremely original and mind opening find . 
   the problems might not be there yet , but just by looking at the demographics , they will be in a matter of decades . 
  i knew that estonians were smart but did not know that you had fortunetelling skills . 
  does not matter , he stated facts and he even praised intra-eu migration and that it was a right . 
  on the other hand you definitely sound like germany is close to the damnation . 
   you act like the immigrant problems in your country are with intra-eu migrants where did he say that ? 
  anti erdogan people were/are naturally anti fetullah since he was his mentor and way bigger threat to secular turkey . 
  i myself also do not feel bad for the followers of fetullah but it is not deniable that tayyip is going to replace those people with his mindless drones . 
  at the end we are fucked anyway . 
  prime example of why abortion should be legal . 
   because fuck turkey . 
  and as long as france is here , it 's a done deal . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franco-ottoman_alliance ), 
  `` essentially . '', 
  speaking of trump rhetoric ? 
  comparing refugees who are not allowed to work and on benefits essentially and turks who migrate to work is not an honest comparison . 
  do not play the fool here . 
  we got what he meant . 
  of course mate , of course . 
  you know another thing that i do not get ? 
  beating around the bush . 
  very informative . 
   by your logic , turkish people should not be allowed to go to europe ( specially germany ) and ** feed on social benefits . 
  ** now as a proper humanist and progressive person cite your sources that the majority of the turks live on social benefits . 
  complaining ? 
  fine by me , let them pass through . 
  slighlty , since they are probably more crowded than an estonian or finnish pack of guys . 
  i am dumb middle eastern . 
  thanks for correcting . 
  claiming turks are not european , stating armenians are europeans lol . 
  we got it mate , evil muslims slaughtering christians . 
  i 'm impressed !, 
  almost a day and people still comment without reading the article . 
  people get triggered a lot when they see eu and turkey together . 
  : ddd, 
  were . 
  ottoman empire , republic of turkey . 
   islamic republic , christians and jews have always been second-class citizens in turkey . 
  educate yourself . 
  let me correct for you ; akp loyalists vs. gulenists . 
  you are welcome . 
  and those gulenists are dutch ? 
   gulenists-turks is this a thing now ? 
  lol wtf is gulenists vs turks ? 
  ok maybe , maybe not . 
  you have a point tho , so apologies . 
  do not mind my rant . 
  true , yet they probably know also arabic . 
  so safe to sum up them into arabic dialects . 
  you have two less languages , here you go . 
   kurdish , turkish why ? 
   and 1 in turkey/syria for me and further eastern states like afghanistan , pakistan migrants . 
  yeah , no . 
  lol . 
  thanks for the laugh . 
  is this strong beard for you guys ? 
  happy independence day . 
   and yeah , probably that 's why ** bible ** says to judge on actions , not words and there was enough time to check if a party is doing what it has promised . 
  you , my friend made my day today . 
  : ddd, 
   but is still behind western europe . 
  thanks for agreeing . 
  : ddd indeed . 
   can you discuss without hyperbolizing discutant claims ? 
  it 's immature and unfair and i wo n't discuss with someone who 's doing that . 
  comedy gold . 
  : ddd, 
  lol , and your western europe description is on point with being catastrophy and getting worse ? 
  plus i have not suggested that they were richer because of muslim immigration in fact i have not talked about financial status at all . 
  lol, 
  fair enough , after all it matters if you feel happy or not .

  we did it before it was cool . 
  same with ours . 
  that 's why wikipedia is better than any other history book taught in schools . 
  serbia : in the [ battle of ankara ( 1402 ) between ottomans and timurids ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_ankara ) , serbs that were fighting on the losing ottoman side died with honor , while tatars and other turkish beyliks deserted their positions and joined to timur . 
  greece : after the [ siege of tripolitsa ( 1821 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_tripolitsa ) which lead to the greek independence from ottoman , all the jews in the area were killed along the muslims .

  hey this is creative, 
  man i would really like beer right now , and a hug !, 
   what part of anatolia are your roots from ? 
  butt the fuck off ? 
  we lost so many things ( culture , diversity , tolerance ) with the loss of greeks/armenians/jews / syriacs . 
  it will be even worse if we lose kurds . 
  < now i will act like a greek in turkey/ottoman related threads  is this revolution that you ( yes , personally you ) killed 15k turkish civilians ? 
  we call it `` kol b\u00f6re\u011fi '' . 
  roughly translated as `` arm b\u00f6rek '', 
  i think he will die as president . 
  hope it will be early and violent . 
  you should be a proud ` earthling ' . 
  it 's secret kebab plan to reunite balkans, 
  i think it has a different definition in every country . 
  here , everybody is considered white ( there is almost no africans ) . 
  even though we have people with different looks ( mediterranean , middle eastern , slavic , caucasian ( literally ) , asian ) we do n't have classifications like white or brown . 
  you can be called blonde ( sar\u0131\u015f\u0131n ) or yellow ( sar\u0131 ) and tan ( esmer ) or dark ( kara ) . 
  for example ex-prime minister [ b\u00fclent ecevit ] ( http://cdn.listelist.com/listeliststatic/2014/05/bulent-ecevit-13.jpg ) 's nickname was `` kara o\u011flan '' ( the dark boy ), 
  that 's too ... specific . 
  yeah , you dig a lot when you lose big time . 
  word bazaar is originally coming from persian language . 
  i think some of these words are just maybe coming from a common root because many of them are created from verbs that have been around for a very long time . 
  for example : sarma -  sarmak ( to cover ) \u00c7ekmece -  \u00c7ekmek ( to pull ), 
  the main reason is not being muslim . 
  you know they can always turkify the other muslims ( including armenian and georgian muslims ) which they did mostly . 
  these thing happen in turkish prisons . 
  if you are a rapist , or a big shot terrorist like anders here , you might get shished ( yeah that 's what is called :d ) by the mafia in prison . 
  went sweden 2 times did n't dare to eat it . 
  `` pide '' is originally a greek word . 
  lol no europe has nothing to do with it . 
  14 years ago , all the right-wing parties collapsed ( another story ) and erdogan won the elections . 
  he looked liked progressive for a while to gain the support of some naive leftist and liberals . 
  in the mean time he allied with a us-backed islamist organization ( who are enemies of erdogan now ) and did everthing to weaken secular structures of the state ( mostly succeeded ) . 
  now the last few years everybody sees his true intentions . 
  it 's not over yet . 
  this year , his followers will create a new constitution , and many people will vote for it . 
  new constitution will enable the arrest of mp 's . 
  all the progressive/secular mp 's will be arrested or scared , and he will finally rule by the iron fist . 
  unless a coup happens . 
  which happens every 15-20 years . 
  and sometimes with executions . 
  * greeks have solid metal bands * syria has beautiful food * iran has great architecture, 
  we generally have high expectations . 
  erdo\u011fan is very unpopular with people who have more than average education . 
  here you see it a lot , and ca n't see his supporters ' point of view . 
  because they ca n't speak english , 
  there are just suspicions . 
  when we say western turkey it 's agean shores and thraccia ( and we can include some big cities in the west such as eski\u015fehir ) . 
  when you go 100-200 km 's inside you see the change . 
  central anatolia and eastern black sea area are giving the biggest support to akp . 
  it sometimes rises to 80 % . 
  i heard they had this burkas in southern italy too . 
  that seems likely considering babek zencani 's ( who was sentenced death penalty ) case in iran . 
  yeah man , we are like the smallest island in caribbean . 
  that 's what i say when i travel to sweden . 
  i check begginner lessons for every language on duolingo and polish made no sense to me . 
  i do n't think we have any chance of becoming eu member with erdo\u011fan now , and things went really bad really fast . 
  for people like me who opposes erdo\u011fan ( half of the country ) eu is really down on the list . 
  we are on the brink of becoming next ukraine or syria . 
  everyday i am warning my family to not to go crowded places . 
  first thing we must stop the violence , and then get rid of erdo\u011fan . 
  then we can try to join eu . 
  yes . 
  i love the wooden church in helsinki . 
  in our minds secular = left . 
  but , compared to today 's values , turkish republic is established with very racist , secular and western ideas . 
  i think it depends how much support/respect that leader/and party has in society . 
  opposition party chp was founded by atat\u00fcrk who gets tremendous amount of respect even from people who vote for other parties . 
  so kemal k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu is on a safer spot compared to normal people . 
  the people who do n't respect atat\u00fcrk are mostly islamists and maybe nationalist kurds . 
  so , even after 13 years of rule , erdo\u011fan does not dare to talk shit about atat\u00fcrk . 
  i think it 's cool that you get to learn a language that your country have historical/cultural bonds . 
  in my highschool german was taught ( very little though ) after english . 
  i would rather take greek or persian courses . 
  after 50 years we have become honorary member . 
  many people probably think that the only way to learn a language is to enroll into paid courses . 
  also the food . 
  same here for swedish . 
  is n't magyaristan largely steps ? 
  i went in october , it was pretty cool . 
  it was around -1 degrees and there was some sun . 
  you hate mongols , we hate huns , greece hates all . 
  you can actually see that ottoman ( and other turkic beyliks/duchies in anatolia ) is founded by people who were basically running away from mongols . 
  it 's nothing compared bulgaria forgetting its turkic heritage xd, 
  just curious , any neo-pagans there ? 
  i remember reading about a new movement . 
  most iranians are shia and the biggest enemies of isis . 
  there are too many . 
  wikipedia says 12 wars were fought with russia ( ottomans got rekt most of the time ) , 11 fought with persia ( mostly when persia ruled by a turkic dynasty ) , 8 with venice , 8 with poland-lithuania , and considerable numbers with habsburgs and bulgarians . 
  however if you count as eastern romans/greeks vs ottomans/turks . 
  this would be the highest . 
  when you become muslim you get free ` summon explosives ' ability 3 times a day . 
  someone [ posted ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/40lp4y/explosion_in_istanbuls_sultanahmet_injuries/cyv66e8 ) pictures of dead bodies on r/worldnews .

currently no power has been given to the office of presidency . 
  he is simply using his own influance , not the power of the office he holds . 
  the aim of erdo\u011fan is to make a new constitution which would give the presidency more power . 
  however with the curent number of seats he can not do it . 
  he tries desperately to pass that constitution and there are talks of referandum for a new constitution . 
  they pulled a house of cards style war on terror shit just to steal past november elections and it is currently hurting the economy real bad . 
  if they are not willing to further destabilze the country this term will be his last shot at making that constitution happen . 
  but i doubt it . 
  why ? 
  the fact that i see you under every single turkish related post bashing says much about you and this fact alone is an insult in itself , no need for me to say anything more . 
  it proves you are a pathethic human being with no other goal than provoking and bashing turkish people on the internet . 
  and fuck you and whoever fucked with your brain along with tayyip and his daughter . 
  and while i 'm at it fuck the orthodox too because why the fuck would i care about a fucking church ? 
  i do n't even go to mosque !, 
  well the turkish community across balkans would like to rebuild and reopen the mosques in selanik , belgrad , sofia , eflak whatever . 
  the coin has two sides motherfucker . 
  http://www.erolsasmaz.com/?oku=730 that thing was old , useless and a blight on my eyes everytime i drove past it . 
  it was used as army depot after the great war . 
  it was inside the borders of gendarmerie . 
  glad it 's gone . 
  there are more beautiful churches in alsancak which are kept in good shape by their community and the state . 
  you should stop whatever you are trying to accomplish with changing words here . 
  muslim is fine , even if it gets negative attention . 
  nothing is more discriminatory than sugar coating or changing a word so that it attracts less negative attention . 
  4 grand dads !, 
  wow . 
  i never knew soviet people were so sexually open minded . 
  i agree with the post . 
  i do n't agree with the changing of the word from muslim to moslem . 
  i 'm a sucker for old french revolutionary marches . 
  not that i 'm a communist , quite the contrary actually . 
  i just like the aggressiveness and meaning behind the words which seeks to empower the people who are crushed under the weight of a corrupt state . 
  there is a [ special one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7onju77iy ) that i like a lot . 
  mark my words ; when they change that fucking constitution , i will be listening to it while i go `` chercher mon fusil '' . 
  armenian is not a race , it 's an ethnicity . 
  he is simply pointing out that the level of attention this whole insult erdo\u011fan gets and the level of anger it generates is inproportionate compared to cases which occured before concerning insults to other european political figures . 
  how stupid do you have to be to make idiotic claims about something you know so little about ? 
  i am not impressed !, 
  one shitty soviet made bulldozer ? 
  that 's all ?!, 
  they should have called an airstrike on them !, 
  brutally murder all dissenters . 
  the winning side says sorry a cenury or two later . 
  problem solved . 
  see , if you ask that some people might also ask when did the ethnic cleansing of armenians was characterised as genocide and your argument would power their argument because it 's exactly the same situation . 
  hypocrisy will never help you , do n't forget that . 
  what about the circassian genocide ? 
  i 'm not interested in one sided accusations and politicization of massacres . 
  it 's inhumane . 
  i 'm sure after doing all this against turkey eu political elite will be eager to suck russia 's dick for energy ressources . 
  i am turkish . 
  and i am also circassian-bosnian muslim . 
  a word of advice to anyone who bring that shit up : all suffered , without exception . 
  if you pick sides now it 's not going to end up well for you because the crimes you also trying to `` whitewash '' are going to surface . 
  i 'm lost between chicken and kebab . 
  please donate them some combat boots or something . 
  i hate to see them getting shot at and die in sandals . 
  no way \u0130zmir is greece . 
   especially the parts that used to be georgia let us all be content with what we have now and forget about what we [ had ] ( https://taylorrockhill.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/ottoman-empire.jpg ) then . 
  russia has cute girls . 
  iran has cute girls who like to show everything they got once they are here because they ca n't show it back home . 
  georgia has old ladies . 
  cyprus has legal loopholes and casinos and cute girls . 
  iraq and syria has petrol . 
  bulgaria has cute and cheap girls . 
  but above all , there is greece , that i like very much and love for they are culturally and ethnically so similar to us because they are our ex-colony . 
  well , as turkey is not in north america or europe , we do not have the same values and way of life . 
  and unless you expect anatolian tectonic plate to suddenly move about 5000 km and park itself in north sea , i do n't see it becoming any `` western '' than it already is . 
  i mean what is `` way of life '' or what values are you talking about ? 
  are you asking if turks like coffee more than tea or kebab more than bacon ? 
  are you asking about family values ? 
  if we are into freedom and democracy \u2122 or do we lean more towards libert\u00e9 , egalit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 \u00ae ? 
  can you elaborate what you are asking without using some loose and incomprehensible definition please ? 
  if you do so i can give you a precise answer . 
  edit : a word . 
  what 's western ? 
  west of where ? 
  the term itself is so loose that it 's difficult to understand what you are trying to ask . 
  is it a democracy ? 
  not so much when you compare it to france or germany but it 's definitely better if compared to russia . 
  if it 's economy you are referring to then it 's in a much better shape than all balkan and east european countries ( except russia ) but not really better than uk or italy . 
  if you are asking about the military then it is quite ahead of most nations with the exception of countries with very large economies . 
  if you are asking how conservative the population is ; it is a very conservative society especially the rural parts , as much as greece and maybe a little bit more . 
  the reaction of turkish people to events that threatens the country is very similar to that of american population . 
  and lastly if you are asking about how corrupt it is ; it 's much worse than danmark or finnland but better than russia or romania or bulgaria . 
  edit : oh and i forgot to mention ; if you are asking about geography and take japan as your point of start then turkey is most definitely a western country . 
  this was way before putin began to act all stalin in russia . 
  i guess he had to prove that he was riding as good as [ this dude ] ( https://dursadekircan.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/ataturk-at-uzerinde.jpg ) and failed miserably . 
  eu is not a country . 
  and i 'd pay to see the face of a german economist trying to figure out the shitstorm such a mad idea would provoke . 
  who is `` we '' ? 
  estonia ? 
  no fuck that . 
  the horse which nearly gutted him with its hoof should be on t-shirts . 
  [ and multiple angles available to print on a t-shirt ! ], 
  you do n't just shut down an economy of that size without hitting yourself in the leg and in case of turkey it would be more like chopping off a limb . 
  it 's not eu4 and i invite you to understand the severity of economic sanctions . 
  mine . 
  i feel a bit ashamed but i know the answer to that question . 
  f\u00f6\u015fik sverige ... omg those comments on youtube,

yes , it 's that speech . 
  and all your links have accurate translations of parts of his speech . 
  holy shit , the subtitles are absolute garbage . 
  literally no sentence is close to being an accurate translation of what any the mps or the speaker of the parliament say . 
   what the speaker actually says : `` mr enc\u00fc , you are out of time . '', 
   what the subtitle says : `` turkish mp : you signed your own death '' for context , the mp is talking about police and military brutality and how the government does nothing to stop it . 
  at no point does he say anything about armenians or greeks or any of that stolen land nonsense . 
   that said , i really dont think you should give them visa free travel when they have n't implemented the biometric passports , but having experienced eu border controls as a non eu citizen , they are a joke anyway . 
  we 've implemented biometric passports in 2010 and all older passports became invalid as of last year . 
   turkey , however , has become a problem . 
  a really big problem . 
  a week ago friday , turkish soldiers and police surrounded the offices of zaman , the country 's largest and by some measures best newspaper , fired tear gas , broke down the doors and seized control of the paper and its media empire with authorization from courts appointed by president recep tayyip erdogan and his party . 
  by sunday morning , the paper , known for its independent-minded columnists , was publishing the most anodyne form of government propaganda . 
  there 's no question censorship and denial of free speech are one of the biggest problems in turkey . 
  zaman , however , is the mouthpiece of the [ g\u00fclen movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c3%bclen_movement ) , or was i suppose . 
  those independent `` journalists '' were the biggest supporters of the akp regime up until a few years ago when akp and g\u00fclen broke up over distribution of the profits they gained through corruption . 
  this guy does n't know what he 's talking about . 
  you can force the bitrate . 
  press ctrl + shift + alt + s while the movie is playing , select the highest bitrate on the list in the middle , click override . 
  then rewind the video to the start . 
  i am not arguing the use of excessive force by israel , just pointing out the fallacy here . 
  the argument is `` turkish military has the capability to wipe out southeast anatolia , but does n't exercise it . 
  therefore , turkey , unlike israel , does not use terror . '', 
  does n't really make sense when israel has a much smaller area to deal with and the most perfect weapon for the job humanity has developed , no ? 
   unlike certain countries in the area * cough israel cough * turkey actually does n't terrorize people . 
  that 's a self-defeating argument . 
  israel military can just as easily kill every single person in palestine as ours can in southeast anatolia . 
  more easily , since they have nukes . 
   natos 2nd strongest military ca n't defeat the pkk well , this is probably true . 
  guerilla warfare is no joke . 
  it 's also the year galatasaray was founded , lol . 
  i 'll bet it 's better known than any historical event in turkey . 
  inflation/deflation is the rate by which the prices change compared to previous timeframes , whatever the reason for that price change . 
  say that the overall prices of goods in the economy rose by 2 percent , then you have 2 percent inflation . 
  if they fell by 2 percent , you have 2 percent deflation . 
  it does n't cause price changes . 
  saying prices can change without inflation does n't make sense , because inflation * is * the price change . 
  it is measured by putting together a basket of goods meant to be representative of the total economy and tracking the prices of those goods . 
  `` smarmy person '' maybe ? 
  literally , it means `` juvenile louse . '', 
  i have no idea why we use it that way though . 
  who ? 
  it 's pretty simple actually , but i added a link to my post that describes how it 's done on chrome . 
  or block cookies from the economist . 
  and his name is daniel jackson . 
  at least in this comment chain , you have n't said anything like that dude . 
  you ca n't just change your claims like that . 
  but anyway . 
  what `` some turkish people '' think or feel is irrelevant . 
  sure , the moral thing to do is take care of the syrians until they can safely return to their homeland , but a ) we are n't realistically capable of doing that and b ) we are as selfish as the next guy and do n't really want to . 
  it 's not as if the sentiment seems to be any different with the european peoples , otherwise why is there a whole migrant crisis ? 
  diplomacy , from what i 've seen , is a group of assholes trying to exert power on another group of assholes by using whatever leverage they have . 
  that 's the way it 's always been and no one is going to change that unilaterally , the least of all our shitty government . 
  our politicians are playing the same game everyone else is . 
  you can not expect to just offload your border patrol duties on us without giving us anything in return . 
   i know that you 're full on mode turkey center of the world everyone needs us but those refugees are yours and they should be hosted in turkey.in fact i wonder how those new syrian citizens would see the turkish government letting people drown on the mediterranean . 
  i 'm not sure what exactly your argument here is . 
  those refugees are being hosted by turkey . 
  as a matter of fact , we are hosting more refugees than any country on earth . 
  are you seriously accusing us of not doing our part ? 
  and in what way is the turkish government letting people drown on the aegean or mediterranean ? 
  the people who 've died chose , of their own free will and knowing the dangers , to illegally travel to greece with the aid of smugglers . 
  while tragic , turkey bears no culpability in it . 
  pretty sure these numbers are from [ this research ] ( http://www.wingia.com/en/services/end_of_year_survey_2014/regional_country_results/8/46/ ) that someone posted on this sub yesterday . 
  the question they asked is `` if there were a war that involved < country name  , would you be willing to fight for your country ? '', 
  our pm says they 've made the request . 
  us state department says they are still assessing if the documents sent constitute a formal request . 
  https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2016/08/260841.htm#turkey i 'd like to know how this process is supposed to work if anyone here knows about it . 
  * http://www.medyatava.com/tiraj * http://gazetetirajlari.com/ * http://www.medyaradar.com/tirajlar * http://www.canlitv.com/rating/?tur=gazete sabah is the second according to all of these . 
  it 's obviously the illuminati . 
  yours does n't ? 
  no , see my post [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4tt7th/erdo%c4%9fan_declares_state_of_emergency/d5k3asf ) . 
  only certain decrees can be made and these are specified by law . 
  everything else remains the same . 
  are you sure about this ? 
  from what i know , the administration can unilaterally declare a state of emergency , if certain conditions defined in the constitution are met . 
  the parliament only has the authority to extend it once the initial period is over . 
  edit : nevermind , i was wrong . 
  parliament needs to confirm it . 
   do you know if he / the government can dissolve the parliament now ? 
   or introduce new laws without the parliament ? 
  yes , a state of emergency gives the administration and the president ( which , in practice , will just mean the president in this case since no one is likely to object ) the power to introduce decrees that act as law . 
  they are submitted to the parliament for confirmation the next day . 
  i do n't know what happens if the parliament rejects them , but akp has the majority in the parliament anyway . 
  the types of decrees available to the administration are defined in the constitution ( or another legislature , i 'm not sure ) . 
  some of the important ones include : * establish curfews and ban protests/gatherings * conduct body or vehicle searches * ban basically any kind of publication ie . 
  books , papers , magazines , tv , movies , plays etc. 
   can he easily ban political parties ? 
  pretty scary stuff . 
  one of the first thing military did yesterday was take over the state television channel to force them to broadcast their statement . 
  the anchor was pretty clearly shaken up as she made the announcement . 
  part of the statement is that all media channels were `` ordered '' to broadcast that statement . 
  some did as ordered , some did without the sound ( props to them ) . 
  there 's a video on the internet of the assault where a military commander threatens to shoot when the journalists there request to ask questions . 
  in the 1980 coup , 937 films were banned , hundreds of journalists were sentenced to a total of 3300 years in prison , 300 were attacked and 3 were killed , no newspapers were published for a year , 40 tonnes of journals and papers were destroyed , 300 cases were opened for 13 major newspapers . 
  this is just the official report . 
  you are fucking delusional if you think there is anything resembling a media , free or otherwise , under military dictatorship . 
  democracy has never been about electing the most capable or fair leaders . 
  it 's about everyone having a voice in how a country is run . 
  most of the time , that results in populist douchebags in control because people are fucking stupid .

  it is mostly historical genocidal denial/recognition war and qarabag issue between azerbaijan and armenia . 
  wipe out 15 million kurds in turkey ? 
  and since almost half of the kurdish votes for him ? 
  this ultimate goal is simple , shift turkey to a more conservative society . 
  because this is his ideology . 
  he is a conservative . 
  he is a political islamist . 
  he wants to shift the country to this lane , to the islamist lane . 
  and since he has a wind behind him , he wants to solidify his position by using this wind . 
  and also almost like every politician , he wants to keep his power and his wealth . 
  he does n't want to be trialed because of his crimes and corruptions . 
  and also because of his ego . 
  he is not much cultured man , neither a emphatic one . 
  he just cares about his own ego and position . 
  erdogan is a really evil politician , one of the worst thing that happened to turkey in our history , but invations and genocides and massacres ? 
  let 's read the book correct . . 
  s-s-s-scandinavian ? 
  i am a bit scared now . 
  are you drunk ? 
  history has been lived , and future await to be lived , and what is the best way to live it rather than by sense of humour ? 
  i guess it was like this ; ** ring ring ** ** ring ring ** - sweden , can you answer the phone , i have to separate this plastic botttles and plastic bags for recycle . 
  if it is finland drunk calling , say him yes he is scandinavian for fucks sake . 
  well said . 
  geographicly , turkey have a small chunk of land ( something like 5 % maybe ) on continental europe , and have a population of almost 15 % lives on european soil ( mostly european part of istanbul , but something like 2 million on the other cities of thrace ) . 
  and culturally turkey is not that much europe of course ( and european culture is kinda a vogue discription too but to simplyfy think of france sweden spain germany poland and bulgaria melted in a pod ) . 
  the weird part is turkey neither that much middle east when you consider culturally . 
  beside sharing a common base religion , middle east is not much representing turkey either . 
  also the islamic behaviors is kinda different in turkey than middle east countries and i am not even counting the alawis and philosophical teology that rooted in anatolian land that doesnt have anything similar to middle eastern islam but that is a really deep and different topic . 
  simply turkey do not much share with me countries either . 
  that creates a dilemma . 
  turkey obviously is not european and not obviously for lots of peole but not middle eastern too . 
  and in the modern world no country has luxury to be a lone star eaither . 
  you this way or other way be a part of a larger group . 
  in the history , old turkish empire had a essential role in europe , its actions shaped europe and europes actions shaped the empire . 
  we can still track affect on balkans and modern turkey still have effect of balkans on it ( i am myself a quarter albanian for example ) . 
  and civilizations goals of young turkish republic also adds to this effects . 
  founder fathers and ataturk had chosen the path the western countries one have chose instead of eastern traditional way if development ( yes east of europe is not all stone age ) . 
  but cultures always have a moment of inertia . 
  you can not transform easily ( and also turkey never have to transform to be counted as a european country , turkish culture is unique and precious as any culture ) . 
  as i said this efforts ripped turkey from middle east further more . 
  turkey do not share same language with middle eastern countries , doesnt share the same nationalistic values , and progress path . 
  if turkey is not part of europe , than it is lonely . 
  because eventhough some europeans see us in this land as invaders , well the history is not that simple . 
  actually we were always here . 
  most of us always lived in this land , just under different jackets . 
  assimilation it is , and before post french revolution era , nationalistic ideas was not that strong . 
  we are decendants of greek , armenian , indiginous people of asia minor , slavics and countles more and also of course those migrated from the steppes if central asia too who is converted to another religion for lots of reasons ( obeying the authority , desire of having power , just because , slain , taxes , etc ) opps i had written so much . 
  well , for short geographically , turkey is a little in europe , mostly in asia . 
  culturally a little european , less than that middle eastern , basicly turkish . 
  if turkey must be considered somewhere in the geography of cultures , more logical to say european . 
  turkey is like a really weird and strange part of europe in my book, 
  no it is not . 
  europe is europe ( almost for sure ) . 
  almost certainly lower than russia . 
  i would bet for % 20 . 
  edit : i just saw the below survey . . that is something , 
  oh good , they have n't done the survey in turkey . 
  shame is averted this time ... yea , boo russia !, 
  trigger deactivated !, 
  nice move , 
  they can not hear us , there is not enough oxygen to sound travel through : /, 
  in case of taxation , u.s. 
  citizenship and resident alien ( e.g. 
  greencard holders ) are subjected to same practice . 
  so grencard holders pay taxes to usa eventough the reside and work abroad too . 
  already , in many cases greencard holder is almost a real usa citizen without right to vote and right to u.s. passport . 
  well , she is a she right now . 
  the weird part is she kept her male name after her surgery . 
  bulent is a pretty masculine name . 
  it was a little trauma when i was little and mom explained me why is she is like this . 
  https://youtu.be/rgxe83lxgjg you totally deserved this , buddy . 
  she is always on this dinners erdogan holds on his palace or somewhere annually with the artists and fames . 
  ( by saying `` artists '' do n't expect intellectual ones , only the pop culture and ass licking ones ) she really loves erdogan , seriously . 
  if autopsy of kurt indicates that he died due to tetanus , than it is a possibility . 
  suspicious indeed . 
  yea everyone knows that 72m muslims live in a 10 million country already . 
  gosh it is so hard to make ironic jokes nowadays without using '' / s '' . 
  we host almost same amount of muslims as sweden does so ... wait !, 
  since noone mentioned yet , for baguette 's sake ; `` neither holy nor roman nor empire '' btw , he was charles v , or carlos quinto , or as known in turkey , \u015earlken . 
  since tatars are driven away ? 
  but once you have this sweet extra missionary strenght and culture conversion cost reduction , it is so easy to convert those land and it pays its price . 
  safi trade node is important for sevilla . 
  merkel is doing really good for germany imo . 
  however i really like the system of the usa . 
  do your term for at most 8 years and than go on your way . 
  `` a 80 million pop country can find a replacement for you so you are not unique '' i probably think like this because of our current glorious leader ( first of his name , ruler of comars , god bless him ) is on power for 15 years now . 
  but still , it is a good system in my opinion . 
  alright , here we go . 
  thank you posts to greece and all the other things you would expect on this sub . 
  however here is the thing that must of you do not want to hear ; nisanyan is a very well educated and well serviced intellectual . 
  he created one of the best turkish ethimologic dictionary . 
  however he is a weird guy . 
  and as you all thought here , he is not sentenced to 17 years prison for being a opposition to government . 
  he is not even a real opposition and he is not even sentenced to exactly 17 years of prison . 
  the guy had a illegal construction . 
  before it , he literally throw his own shit to his wife . 
  he treated her wife couple occasions . 
  his illegal actions are cumulated . 
  and he is sentenced to prison . 
  and the total amount he needed to serve was only 3 years 2 months of this 17 years than he would be freed under promising that he wo n't commit another crime again .

  [ tell that to hdp ] ( http://i.cdn.ensonhaber.com/resimler/diger/g_2951.jpg ) chp has a zaza chairman and erdo\u011fan himself is georgian , with kurd and arab ministers in the cabinet . 
  people who do n't know the background of the conflict and cultural/political nuances in turkey call it ethnic because it 's easy when ethnicity is a pretty small part of the whole thing . 
  a fairly common mistake . 
  cultural differences created the conflict and political differences fed it . 
  actual race was n't an issue even in the beginning since \u00d6calan is half turkish in his mother 's side . 
   mhp does represent the general mind among the turkish population . 
  that 's why they get about 10 % of the vote . 
   nation wide demonstration agains turkish military 's killing of kurdish civilians ? 
  there were in big cities . 
  i was there in istanbul . 
  not everyone who does n't like the regime can take the streets in turkey , police fucks you up . 
  they were still crowded though . 
  i 'm yet to see a kurdish protest against pkk killing civilians but i wo n't hold kurds responsible because i actually know about the reality of the area and how hard and dangerous it is to protest something , unlike you . 
   do n't come telling me your country has any morality . 
  it is based on racism & supremacy . 
  insulting a country by calling them racist is , funnily enough , pretty close to the exact definition of racism . 
  it 's not even just the bias . 
  she 's completely clueless about the history and current political situation of turkey and the middle east . 
  she tried to write a piece about secularism in turkey and it was hilarious . 
  she did n't even know the dates she tried to refer to let alone the social condition and political nuances . 
  she compensates her ignorance with outrageous comments like that to gain publicity . 
  they are called secular in the west , and are secular compared to other similar organizations in the region but secularism is certainly not one of their concrete positions . 
  here 's hdp 's [ islamic conference ] ( http://t24.com.tr/haber/demokratik-islam-konferansinin-ana-temasi-islam-ve-baris-olacak,320185 ) and [ memorial for sheikh said ] ( http://anfmobile.com/kurdistan/seyh-sait-ve-arkadaslari-anildi ) , leader of the islamist uprising of 1925 . 
  they do n't claim to be marxists . 
  thanks man . 
  we 'll be safe when the papa terrorist calling himself the president gets toppled . 
  isis is the prime suspect as turkey just launched an offensive in al bab against them . 
  pkk also has the operational capacity for that . 
  a syrian rebel faction could 've done it like nusra in suru\u00e7 , they use bombs to `` negotiate '' and give messages to their allies too or remainder of g\u00fclenists from the coup is also a possibility , but the last two are a bit weak possibilities since it 's not easy to cause an explosion that big in the center of istanbul . 
  nevertheless , it is possible . 
  as a bonus , there is always the possibility of an akp false flag operation , they are clearly not above that . 
  people are discussing four different organizations that might 've done this . 
  erdo\u011fan before the elections : `` elect akp or there will be instability '' . 
  wow , i wonder what an unstable turkey would be like , considering the `` stable '' one has four different terrorist organizations that can blow you up anytime . 
  first of all the difference between my argument and the holocaust denier arguments is that in no way do i think that the armenian atrocities are the cause or the legitimization of the genocide , neither do i deny the catastrophe that happened in 1915 . 
  the stuff you wrote is basically why i agree that 1915 was a genocide . 
  you seem to think that calling it a genocide in a political context is somehow lighter than the scientific context , which i disagree with . 
  in a purely scientific discussion , the fact that the massacres were n't directly commanded by the higher authorities and the ottoman government did n't have any control on it s eastern provinces comes up . 
  i think that this discussion only belongs in the academy , and the political reality is forcing mass deportation without enough food , supplies and among extremely hostile kurdish clans without protection and with mostly racist officers in charge of the organization is n't that different from outright killing people in a political scale . 
  if the ottoman authorities had the intent of wiping armenians out is purely academical , because even if they did n't they knew the reality of that geography and what would happen to the armenians there . 
  some people ( not only turks btw . ), 
  think that these factors make the 1915 events ineligible to call genocide . 
  i disagree but they do have a right to defend that point because they do n't deny that armenians were massacred like holocaust deniers deny that jews were . 
  `` nah nothing happened to armenians '' is disgusting , `` i do n't think what happened could be classified as a genocide '' is discussable . 
  again , i would say that it was clearly a genocide , bu it is discussable . 
  there were pre-genocide atrocities by armenians too in the russian occupied kars and erzurum provinces . 
  armenians , afraid of losing their majority to kurds turks and azerbaijanians and the ottoman state , ruled by the racist turanist coup started to fight . 
  armenians allied with russia , which was a hostile power to the ottomans . 
  the ottoman state won that fight with russia weakened by pre revolution crisis , and ended it with a genocide . 
  i 'm not equating the two , one was disorganized militias and the other was a somewhat organized sovereign state . 
  but armenian militias did n't start the massacres only after 1915 , that 's just false . 
  there was tension in the region before that starting with the russian occupation on caucasus and armenians tried to capitulate on that the same way everyone did in the early 20th century : kill anyone that is n't you . 
  we 're not the worst yaaay . 
  we 're still pretty shitty though . 
  1 ) armenian community is n't innocent , their militias were involved in civilian massacres . 
  2 ) armenian people did n't deserve what happened to them . 
  they ca n't be blamed for their own genocide no matter what some of them did . 
  those two statements do n't contradict each other . 
  also , there are historical facts and there are political interpretations of those . 
  armenians have committed massacres . 
  that 's a fact . 
  armenian people were subjects to ethnic cleansing . 
  that 's also a fact . 
  nobody is denying that . 
  i do call the 1915 events a genocide , at least in a political context . 
  in a purely scientific context that would be a longer discussion . 
  some people on this thread do n't call it a genocide . 
  nobody is denying what happened to the armenians though . 
  acknowledging the fact that armenian militias did burn down villages and kill civilians is n't genocide denier rhetoric , it 's a well documented fact . 
  denying that wo n't accomplish anything . 
  there is a shitload of documents on both turkish , armenian and russian archives proving it . 
  it also did n't help that allies have already made plans of partitioning the ottoman empire before the ottomans even joined the war . 
  russians published [ the documents ] ( http://www.kitapyurdu.com/kitap/carlik-belgelerinde-anadolunun-paylasilmasi/32153.html&amp;manufacturer_id=15600 ) proving that after the revolution ( one of the main reasons for turkish-soviet alliance was that ) . 
  it turned out that it was n't really paranoia on the ottoman part . 
  the russian controlled kars and erzurum provinces had overwhelmingly turkish populations btw. , so it still was defence of the homeland . 
  it was n't civilian armenians ' fault , nobody is blaming them . 
  also , nobody deserves that kind of treatment , no matter the crime . 
  collective punishment is a disgusting thing . 
  this does n't mean armenians were completely innocent though . 
  mentioning well documented atrocities against turkish and kurdish civilians by armenian militias together with the russian army is n't historical revisionism or genocide denial . 
  denied those never happened is actually historical revisionism . 
  a mixture of ancient anatolians , slavs from the balkans and ruthenia , greeks , armenians , iranians , arabs and other middle easterns , levantine latins , iberians and jews that came from granada , africans that came after the n. africa conquests , with a pinch of old middle asian turkic genes . 
  so the real question here is what race * are n't * the turks . 
  i do n't know about your friends ' personal experiences but i think not liking a community is n't the same as hating it 's every single member . 
  i 'm a turkish atheist so i probably had way worse experiences than europeans regarding muslims . 
  i do n't like their community and i wo n't like almost anything that comes from their social and political ideas as a group . 
  i also know enough muslims to know that every individual has different values not always conforming to their society . 
  if i did n't notice that i 'd miss out on meeting a lot of great people . 
  also , islamism is a political position , not a spiritual . 
  hating an islamist community is the same as hating a conservative , socialist or liberal community . 
  nothing to do with race or religion . 
  political position is a choice and should be criticized without the `` do n't insult my religion '' card . 
  a person 's spiritual views are his/her own business but if you politicize and create an ideology of your religion , i 'll criticize or even insult it the same way people have been doing to each others ideologies for hundreds of years . 
  i learned to not care about downvotes that much . 
  that 's reddit , what can you do . 
  should 've wrote bulgarians . 
  the word is still `` bulgar '' in turkish so i got it mixed up . 
  it means neighbour . 
  when used in a political context it always means greece . 
  wow .

  i do n't have much clue about mosques and muslims in europe but i 'm curious about one thing . 
  why dont u guys form a religious affairs thing like turkey does . 
  appoint your imams who graduated from respected theological faculties and keep them in check . 
  make their speechs ready or just approve/disaproove their speechs . 
  and if they talk about extreme stuff just fire them and replace with someone else . 
  in that case it wouldnt be so catastrophic to attack istanbul . 
  not sure if serious . 
  ** turkey ** * ** turkey gives france authorization to use turkish airspace in anti-isil operations ** the turkish government has granted france permission to use its airspace in the fight against islamic state of iraq and the levant ( isil ) , diplomatic sources have told h\u00fcrriyet daily news . 
  `` france asked us for authorization to use our airspace in the context of the fight against deash [ isil ] in syria . 
  this authorization was given on condition that the general principles outlined for the coalition countries are followed , '' the source said . 
  france is to `` intensify syria operations '' after the nov. 13 paris attacks , said french president fran\u00e7ois hollande , while police raided the homes of suspected islamist militants across france overnight , arresting 23 people , after french aircraft began intensifying bombing isil targets in the caliphate 's capital , raqqa , on nov. 15 . 
  meanwhile , german defense minister ursula von der leyen will visit turkey on dec. 3 to conduct talks with her counterpart , \u0130smet y\u0131lmaz . 
  although no official decision has been taken yet , german and turkish officials have been working on finalizing a memorandum of understanding on the basis of germany 's proposals , diplomatic sources told the h\u00fcrriyet daily news . 
  germany wants to send six tornado reconnaissance jets , refueling aircraft to \u0130ncirlik airbase in southern turkey , a frigate to protect a french aircraft carrier in the mediterranean sea , and up to 1,200 military personnel to the region for one year , in response to a french appeal after the terrorist attacks in paris that killed 130 people .

  `` when a party-member presidential system is on the table , then it would be a different version of france 's system . 
  that would bring a different strength too , '' erdo\u011fan told reporters onboard a plane returning to turkey from qatar on dec. 3 . 
  responding to a question on the possibility of a system where the president was elected from the ranks of a political party , he said this could be a solution if no other amendment can be achieved . 
  erdo\u011fan also said the country 's `` dual-headed system '' of rule has to be removed , referring to the powers currently held by the president and the prime minister who were both elected to their positions by the public . 
  `` we must remove this duality . 
  otherwise , regardless of how much you like each other or how long you have worked together in the past , there may be problems , '' he said . 
  he also said that any amendment to the system should be voted on in a referendum . 
  recalling that the recently elected government 's announced program included transforming the parliamentary system into a presidential one , erdo\u011fan said the government did not have the power to realize that transition without the support of opposition parties . 
  `` this can be done with the support of other parties in the parliament or through an amendment of the constitution in a referendum . 
  a constitutional amendment can be made in this respect , but it would have to be voted on in a referendum , '' he said . 
  according to the current constitution , if a constitutional amendment is passed with over 330 votes in the 550-seat parliament , a referendum is necessary to approve the change . 
  http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/erdogan-urges-debate-on-french-like-presidential-system.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=92066&amp;newscatid=338 * ** jurists criticize charges over ` insulting ' president , say matter is ` political ' ** https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/gollum.png the growing number of court cases opened against individuals in turkey on charges of `` insulting '' the president has prompted several professional chambers of jurists to hold a workshop on the issue , during which they asserted the issue was a `` political '' one which needed to be fought against through political methods . 
  the workshop , titled `` the crime of insulting the president 's contradiction with the constitution and proposals for a solution , '' was hosted by the ankara bar association on dec. 4 . 
  many academics hold the conviction that article 299 of the turkish penal code ( tsk ) which covers `` insulting the president '' breaches both the european convention on human rights ( echr ) and rulings by the european court of human rights ( ecthr ) , according to hakan canduran , the president of the ankara bar association . 
  serious violations of human rights have been experienced because judicial bodies do not favor freedom of expression while making their decisions on issues related to this article , canduran said . 
  `` a person who defames the president of the [ turkish ] republic shall be imprisoned for a term of one to four years and the penalty to be imposed shall be increased by one-sixth if the offence is committed publicly and by one-third if it is committed by way of press and media , '' states article 299 . 
  since former prime minister recep tayyip erdo\u011fan 's election as president in august 2014 , the number of prosecutions for insulting the head of state has risen and largely targeted artists and journalists , as well as schoolchildren . 
  problems surrounding `` the crime of insulting the president '' are not merely legal , murat arslan , the president of the judges and prosecutors union ( yarsav ) , said . 
  `` we have to see this also as a political problem notwithstanding that it is a legal problem . 
  that 's why we need to raise a political struggle , '' arslan said . 
  mustafa karada\u011f , the president of the union of judges , also echoed arslan 's view . 
  `` the matter is political . 
  politically , ` the crime of insulting the president ' should disappear , '' karada\u011f said . 
  `` they want to silence all of our voices by saying ` insulting the president ; ' it 's all about it , '' he said .

  one soldier was seen in footage of the boat passing holding a ground-to-air missile , drawing an angry reaction from turkish foreign minister mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu . 
  the soldier held the missile on his shoulder in the shooting position during the passing of russia 's `` caesar kunikov '' warship . 
  `` this is provocation , this is a harassing passage , '' \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu told reporters on dec. 6 in his hometown antalya . 
  `` the russian warplanes ' violation of our airspace and the passing of the russian warships through the bosphorus are two very different things , '' he added , referring to the montreux convention regarding the regime of the bosphorus and dardanelles straits . 
  `` the passages should be made in accordance with the international agreements , whether it is a russian ship or of another nationality , the rules have long been determined , '' \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said . 
  he added that the `` necessary answer will be given in situations deemed to be a threat .

  the deal regarding the base was signed between kurdistan regional government ( krg ) president massoud barzani and turkish foreign minister feridun sinirlio\u011flu , during the latter 's visit to northern iraq on nov. 4 . 
  at least 150 turkish soldiers , accompanied by 20-25 tanks , were deployed to the area by land late on dec. 4 , anadolu agency reported . 
  turkish army sources told anadolu agency on dec. 5 that they had been training fighters across four provinces in northern iraq to fight isil . 
  according to the military , the peshmerga forces have been trained for fighting with homemade explosives , heavy machine guns , mortars , artillery and also received first-aid training . 
  more than 2,500 peshmerga , including high-ranking officers , have attended the turkish training , the military added . 
   well , he 'd be hard pressed to shoot it to europe from there . 
  its about 500 meters to 3.5 km . 
   if he shot it towards istanbul he 'd be pretty fucking stupid though , cause aa weapons are n't known to be very effective when shooting surface to surface . 
  which is why i said ** accidently ** and it does n't matter how effective your weapon is . 
  u would still be attacking the largest populated city with the 5th highest gdp in europe . 
  ca n't imagine what would happen if he accidently fired it to the most populated city in europe . 
  i can easliy say that noone in turkey takes this guy serious . 
  even avarage akp voter facepalms when he talks . 
  now , now , bombing syria does n't make you terorist . 
  it makes you normal like the rest of us . 
  do n't bomb the western countries and we are okay . 
  air defence ( surface to air missile system ) projects were started arround 2007 or something . 
  i think we needed them once the syrian civil war started and therefore had to buy chinese stuff but i think they changed their mind . 
  probably prototypes are good enough to mass product , tho i could be very wrong about the last one . 
  by the request of kurdistan regional governent . 
  really ? 
  tom saved hobbits from wights which was sent by witchking to barrow-downs during arnor-era and he changed the fate of middle earth for 2 reasons : 1 . ), 
  obviously saved ring . 
  gave merry the daggers which was enchanted with the power to harm the witch-king of angmar himself by a weaponsmith of arthedain and it indeed did help kill the sauron 's right hand witch king . 
  doesnt justify to kill 2 million innocent people . 
  or glorfindel . 
  senior offical confrimed to the journalist from the exact opposite side of the earth . 
  yea sometimes transformers and sometimes dinosaurs . 
  u never know whats gon na happen in the next day in ankara . 
   the oil is bought through turkey from syria , and it 's sold to black market traders who function throughout the levant nothing new , pkk smuggles stuff into turkey for 30 years . 
   the majority of them have traveled through turkey . 
  this was never denied since all of them disguise themselves as refugees and refugees are not in custody , they are always free to get back to their country . 
  % 0.0006 of them happens to be isis member . 
   middle eastern allies , including saudi arabia and qatar , direct weapons to moderate syrian rebel forces . 
  this was never denied aswell . 
  turkish government supplies turkmens openly and may be fsa aswell . 
  they are n't unsung heroes tho . 
  in fact they are one of the few british people in history i ever heard of . 
  gollum actualy saved the middle earth . 
  that no-good halfling changed his mind and did n't destroy the ring at the end . 
  if it was n't for gollum middle earth could n't be saved and nazguls would catch frodo at the end therefore let sauron destroy the middle earth . 
  this doctor guy actualy complimented him by implying erdogan is the savior of middle east . 
  in other words its leaving people to die under crazy dictators and jihadists groups because your economy would be damaged and its not even really a big strike . 
  if a country like turkey can look after 3 million refugees , richer eu countries than turkey easly could do the same . 
   financially , it 's a burden we do n't need . 
  thats so harsh . . just wow . . they are people not a burden . 
  i hope u never have to go trough this process after a pointless civil war but a little bit empathy would n't hurt . 
  i was doing a research about greek public diplomacy and many articles claim that greece changed its policy towards turks in the late 90s . 
  it is n't correct ? 
  do politicians in greece still see turks as enemies ? 
   better save the fuel turkey u2 \u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 . 
  lots of people got the wrong idea of turks and greeks are still enemies . 
  greece already has a huge airforce and s300 systems anyway . 
  they do n't care as much as avarage redditor cares .

   i 'm a decent looking female good for you . 
   and here we have a lot of muslim palestinians . 
  i have been catcalled , cled names etc. 
  okay , why are you telling me this ? 
   i usually flip them off and tell them to fuck off , but not all women are like me i 'm just imagining an absolute redneck of a woman who thinks so highly of herself right now . 
  good fucking job for standing up , why are you telling me this ? 
  i really do n't care . 
  do n't you think i 'd mention it if any of my close female relatives were harassed ? 
  also , is harassment limited to sexual harassment ? 
  i 've been harassed by street thugs more than i can count , because they are thugs and because they wanted my money . 
  how does that explain why i 'm not harassed ? 
  edit : i 'm not even muslim . 
  turkey will live a second first world war my ass . 
  what a load of nonsense . 
  and isis will disagree with most everything i say too . 
  what 's your point exactly ? 
  of course not . 
  you 're talking as if i 'm saying turkey has the right to claim soil in greece or bulgaria or whatever land belonged to the ottoman empire in the past . 
  it 's ridiculous that we have to ask for permission to rule over our own soil . 
  turkish empire has lost most of its lands in the balkans and middle east - fair and square . 
  but south east turkey belongs and has belonged to turkish nations for centuries ( today too ) , it 's not like kurds have the right to claim those lands as if those lands belonged to them for centuries . 
   britain is the successor of the british empire but that does n't give it the right to occupy india the ottoman empire did n't colonize the lands that we know today as turkey . 
  india never belonged to the british empire , it was merely a colony . 
   it would be ridiculous for the mongols to demand all of asia because of genghis khan . 
  yeah , exactly , and turkey is n't demanding anything ? 
  what 's your point ? 
   they have the same national rights as the turks do . 
  they do indeed . 
   if you do n't allow them those rights , turkey will live a second first world war so good luck with that . 
  what is this even supposed to mean ? 
  turkey by its constitution has its borders defined and every single citizen of turkey by law has to abide the constitution . 
  no one citizen is above the other , this has nothing to do with granting anyone any rights . 
  turkey is the successor of the ottoman empire , which ruled those lands for centuries . 
  how do they have the right to govern `` themselves '' ? 
  as if south-east turkey is n't being governed by turkey ? 
  what gives the kurds the right of autonomy there ? 
  thank you for empathizing . 
  i find that too many people get caught up in the wind of nationalism and political hatred that they fail to see the people who died are just that . 
  people . 
  ordinary people like you and me . 
  it really sucks , and i do n't see the situation getting any better , all i hope is that erdo\u011fan loses enough support until the next elections and another party is voted into power . 
  but next elections are in a good 3-4 years , and by then it might just be too late . 
  how is this related ? 
  kurds were n't majority in most of the area until a few decades ago . 
  what right do they have to hold a referendum ? 
  the soil belongs to turkey . 
  it has for centuries . 
  probably less , cause is n't 5 % the number of people in the netherlands who originate from muslim-majority countries ? 
  very likely that a good portion of these people have abandoned their faith too . 
   we also do kill innocent kurds as much as `` we '' kill innocent turks . 
  it 's not like there is discrimination of any sort when it comes to these , nobody is deliberately targeted . 
  could be pkk or any related kurdish militant group , or it could be isis . 
   long term outlook \u0130zmir is known for being the most ` european ' and liberal city in turkey . 
  the progressiveness of \u0130zmir seems to slowly fade away as people with radically different mentalities came here . 
   tensions most people here used to be in favor of helping refugees , but now that there are a lot of them , racism is on the rise for sure . 
  people want them gone , i just want a better solution to be found . 
   rising crime rates on the news recently it said sexual assaults in turkey saw a 30 % increase or something in the past year . 
  i have no specific data for \u0130zmir but theft etc. 
  does happen way more often , according to my uncle who is ex-head of police department in \u0130zmir . 
   unemployment i really do n't know . 
  unemployment in turkey was already high but i 'm not sure how much the refugees affected this . 
   downward pressure on wages well , since syrian refugees are fine with working for lower wages , i reckon there is a downward pressure . 
  but i have no statistics to back up my claim . 
   citizenship i read that about syrian refugees gave birth to 300,000 ~ infants in turkey since the beginning of the refugee crisis . 
  i think these infants will be eligible for turkish citizenship as turkey has similar citizenship laws with the us . 
  their parents probably wo n't get citizenship though , not for a decade or so anyway according to the normal regulations . 
  as if eu countries are housing majority of the refugees , let alone all war refugees in the world . 
  they do n't integrate . 
  i can only speak for refugees in \u0130zmir but it looks like they have no life pretty much . 
  many of them sleep on the streets , all lumped up together . 
  most of the kids do n't go to school either . 
  one thing that happened is they pretty much took over a cafe/bar street in \u0130zmir and now instead of turkish music , arabic songs took over . 
  that 's exactly what you did , to be fair . 
  \\  swedish sounds weird \\  speaks finnish himself my great grandma is finnish and it 's by far the weirdest language i 've heard . 
  sounds like complete gibberish , as if you guys are making up sounds on the spot that have no actual meaning . 
  g\u00f6te giren \u015femsiye a\u00e7\u0131lmaz translation : the umbrella which has entered the butt ( as in , arsehole ) wo n't open meaning/when it 's used : what happened has happened , there 's no going back/fixing it anymore . 
  you 're not backing up your claims . 
  you made a statement . 
  that 's all . 
  no backing up whatsoever . 
  all you said was :  turkey literally extinguished the romano greek culture and i cant believe you would honestly think middle eastern culture has more to do with rome than the west , which wven outside romes borders has modelled itself on the classics while turkey at best tolerated it . 
  that 's a claim . 
  so where is the evidence ? 
  anything to back this up ? 
  but you 're not backing your claims , unlike the historian . 
  i 'm more than happy to hear any counter-claims you have , with supported evidence of course . 
  also , the fact that you downvoted me is telling . 
  so you claim to know more than a historian specialized in this matter ? 
  alright , i 'm sure your prejudice is not clouding your judgment . 
  that 's rich , coming from someone with the name `` tiamat666 '', 
   the only people who want turkey to be considered `` european '' and to join the eu are a handful of rich turkish kids who either live in wealthy areas in istanbul or not in the country at all . 
  clearly you 've never been to turkey , never visited cities like \u0130zmir , edirne , antalya , tekirda\u011f . 
  these cities are more liberal and western than some other balkan cities you can count . 
  not only rich kids in turkey are the way you described it . 
   the general population of turkey , see themselves as turks , different than europeans , middle easterners , and unique . 
  got any source on this ? 
   most turks also do n't want to join the eu maybe now that is the case , maybe because the eu has screwed us over pretty much ? 
  a decade ago everyone was dying to join the eu . 
  now everyone 's simply butthurt , but let me tell you , if there was a general vote whether to join eu or not , the general vote would absolutely be yes . 
  turks want to be part of eu , they just can not admit to it .

  they do n't bomb abortion centers like the republicans in the usa . 
  tldr : they do n't practice islam , they just value it . 
  i did n't downvote you . 
  i rarely use that button anyway . 
  as for your question ; we do n't want to be in charge anyway . 
  it can be nato troops , it can be un troops , it does n't matter at all . 
  saa claims to be fighting with isis . 
  why would n't they be happy for syrians to have a safe zone and let coalition wipe isis out of northern syria ? 
  i thought you were serious :d . 
  that 's syria . 
  i 'm talking about killing/capturing isis members in iraq and turkey . 
  you probably know why turkey ca n't attack syria with ground troops . 
  and no allied forces are willing to send ground troops so why should only turkish soliders die for the future of arabs , kurds and europeans ? 
  this is how that vehicle in the video works . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co31z8ankuw thats why they are so confident . 
   they both signed a ceasefire treaty that was in effect at this time . 
  yes ? 
  this video is from the same timeline and the laws were different back then hence why i used ` were ' in my first post . 
  i think u misunderstood the video . 
  those 2 dark skinned people are isis militants . 
  the ones who arrive with armed vehicle and heavy guns are turkish soliders . 
  soliders were not allowed to shoot at terrorists in turkey unless they fire at you first . 
  in 2013 , 397 anti-terror operations against pkk was denied by the governor out of 400 requests . 
  especially if the hostile units are out of your territory you need the parliament approval for operations . 
  as you can see turkish soliders arrive the border heavly armed to warn the hostile units to move away from the border . 
  they were simply not allowed to shoot them . 
  turkey is in anti-isis coalition and killed/captured more isis members than whole european countries combined ( including russia ) . 
  turkey supports isis perspective comes from the fight with pkk . 
  a terror group which carried thousands times more attacks than isis . 
  not sure why you 're being downvoted . 
  turkey was more liberal and democratic than the majority of the eu members in 1800s-2013 . 
  turkey is forced to find a new path or at least an alternative to europe . 
  it is only natural for the government to change their perspective . 
  what is turkey supposed to say to middle eastern countries ? 
  be secular ? 
  well erdogan actually tried that in egypt and called atheist devil western puppet by everyone in the me/na region . 
  now that he find out that it does n't work that way on that region he started to act like as if he is anti-western . 
  only by the words tho there has been no action at all . 
  it has been 3 years with millions of refugees and we still did n't get any help from eu ( yes we still did n't get a single euro or any serious moral support ) . 
  it was n't trending . 
  lots of people in turkey already say fuck islam or religion after these events all the time . 
  i remember that even a mayor or governor said ` im not muslim if this is islam ' after getting angry at akp . 
  that 's why there is no european superpower anymore . 
  we should have just build nukes and bomb our soil with it . 
  jokes aside this has got ta be the dumbest correlation ever . 
  because that 's the way it is . 
  allied forces are just testing their super weapon called ` weather storm ' , nothing to see here . 
  its not treding . 
  there are like 100ish tweets by 30 accounts . 
  half of them are fake/troll accounts and the other half is condemning the hashtag . 
  100 tweet out of half million about the terror attack does n't mean racism is on the rise . 
  damn , it seems like you were right . 
  all that 30 people with half of them being troll accounts and the other is half is outraging about the hashtag but you got ta realize that there are nearly 40 million active social media users in turkey . 
  downvoted for not following obama . 
  i swear to god if i do n't become celebrity or super rich in this country i will have serious self-confidence problems . 
  i wonder where do you get this ? 
  can you screenshot that hashtag ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_jx5ulgoc4 turkish airlines doing a great job with their videos . 
  you can check their youtube page for more . 
  eh i 'm not that rich anyway . 
  how bad could it be ? 
  does n't matter , every country is unique . 
  usa apologised for ill treatment of native americans but never admitted the genocide . 
  just like erdogan apologised for deporting and killing armenians but never used the term genocide . 
  assuming this guy comes up with ` have a blood test ' , i 'm saying that genetically he does n't look turkish at all . 
  we have interacted with mongons , persians , slavs , armenians , greeks , jews , arabs , kurds , caucasians and many others . 
  so this blood test bullshit makes no sense at all assuming he is from north east / black sea region where turkified pontus greeks and georgians live . 
  he does n't have a huge nose like pontus greek so he probably has georgian ancestors ( genetically speaking ) . 
  our population is ethnically very mixed and the turkic genetics are long gone after the collapse of sipahi system . 
  i 'm assuming the idea here is to protect ` passive gays ' from sexual assaults . 
  that 's why openly active gays still have to serve . 
  the military is insanely strict and you ca n't question the laws or high ranked officers therefore in practice tsk embarrasses itself . 
  same applies to women soliders . 
  they are thinking about conscripting women but turkish population and the army is so big it ca n't be aranged so women can only be commanders . 
  i do n't think tsk is sexist or gay hater since we had everyone involved in our independence war . 
  or you could gib eu to us and we 'd patrol it for you . 
  disclaimer : we take no responsibility for sinking chinese vessels . 
  it would be their fault . 
  hat law from 1925 . every single state officer must wear fedora hats when performing their duty lol . 
  noone gives a fuck about it or ever gets punished for it but it 's still there . 
  do n't get too comfortable tho , everyone thought ` insulting president ' was an ancient law too and see what happened after erdogan . 
   women civilian personnel have been assigned to the headquarters staff , technical fields , and social services without sexual discrimination . 
  women officers serve in all branches except armor , infantry , and submarines . 
  this does n't apply to turkish armed forces . 
  female turkish officers serve in all branches . 
  mehmet ( male name ) or merve ( female name ) my love , i will do you for the good of turkey . 
  kurds are the reason why we have erdogan in the first place . 
  even in the last election a kurdish party got into the parliament for the first time and even in that election erdogan had half of the kurdish votes . 
   last time i watched the kurds have woman in their armed forces so do we . 
  there are currently 90 women colonels ( the highest rank an officer can go unless they became kurmay earlier ) . 
  in fact we may have a female general in 2045 . 
   do n't enforce hijabs and woman can become anything a man can . 
  how do you think turkish women live ? 
   to me a they look like they are part of the few people that already arrived in the 21 . century in turkey . 
  feel free to have a trip over there and see for yourself . 
  in our culture everyone can call themselves turk if they want to but if someone like erdogan ( who does n't even have a turkish look ) calls other people ` you are n't turk ' it is only natural for people to call erdogan ` look at yourself first ' . 
  so what the u/w4hammer says is a typical response in turkey in these kind of situations . 
  probably yes . 
  i heard the same shit from muslims all the time . 
  the constitution of the republic of turkey article 81 .

  because doctors , engineers , programmers etc. 
  all that moved for those countries meanwhile european countries took illiterate villagers from central anatolia en masse . 
  no country in europe ( maybe except scandinavian ones ) will be favoured by secular turks because of akp supporting diaspora ( aka same people they want to flee from ) . 
  they want english-speaking countries like usa , canada ( the most favourite country by far ) , australia . 
  i 'll speak for myself , i feel i have to flee because the country 's future is dark as hell , because staying here and waiting islamists to attack me is not logical option . 
  so in case of migration , i do n't want any erdo\u011fan supporter brain dead people in the country i 'll move to . 
  i 'll flee my country because of these fucking cunts and the * masterpiece * they 've created . 
  an islamic organisation which founded in 60 's to seize the control of the government . 
  they used every possible way to gain support , money , occupation etc. 
  they praised the junta in '97 and '80 so the junta took care of other islamic organisations ( i.e. 
  rival organisations ) and let g\u00fclen 's alone . 
  before 2002 elections , they started to leak into police academia and became buddy buddy with tayyip . 
  after tayyip became prime minister with clear majority in the parliament , their leaking into the institutions became rocket high . 
  first the police academia fell into their hands , then they leaked judiciary . 
  everything was happening under tayyip 's approval by the way . 
  then akp and g\u00fclen decided to weaken the army then start ergenekon & balyoz trials . 
  ergenekon was for secular civilians who publicly oppose islamism and akp . 
  balyoz was for kemalist generals . 
  they 've succeed , turkish armed forces has been weakened so they tried to leak into it as well but unlike the others , the army was tough nut because it 's independent from the government , has their own system , schools etc. 
  so they put a mask on their faces ( metaphorically ) , act like they 're one of them , drink alcohol etc. 
  but the rest of them already knew what they really are according to my friend who are close to the military . 
  anyway , after 2013 summer ; g\u00fclen thought that he 's so powerful that he can even beat tayyip . 
  it 's not clear why they are seperated though . 
  some say g\u00fclen wanted 150 mp from tayyip , some say g\u00fclen wanted intelligence service from him , some say something . 
  you know the rest after this point . 
  let 's come to this coup attempt . 
  the generals who have been arrested by g\u00fclen 's prosecutor have sided with democracy and denounced coup . 
  poor junta though . 
  they thought kemalist generals and soldiers would side with them and would get rid of tayyip . 
  they also thought secular anti-tayyip crowd would side with them . 
  they did n't thought how much kemalist soldiers , anti-tayyip folk hate g\u00fclen for what he has done before . 
  people are supporting erdo\u011fan because they voted for him . 
  the majority voted for him . 
  i hate him to guts but let 's be honest here , he 's democratically elected president of the country . 
  personally i wo n't go out and demonstrate my support for erdo\u011fan because of obvious reasons but that does n't mean i support military coup . 
  nothing can be solved via military coup . 
  erdo\u011fan is a piece of shit , but he 'll be gone once the opposition get their shit together and put strong candidates who know the public . 
  turkey is not russia , erdo\u011fan has no public support like putin has . 
  relax . 
  all those reasons are why kemalist soldiers and generals did n't participated in the coup and the anti-tayyip folk did n't go out and showed their support for the coup as many outsiders expected . 
  why should i pray when especially this attack was motivated from a religion ? 
  french secularism is the only way to combat islamism and its terrorism , not praying . 
  not praying at all . 
   more than 100 journalists have been dismissed or have resigned from poland 's public broadcaster this year , a measure of the major changes underway there . 
  some journalists say that anyone perceived as critical of the law and justice party is now under threat . 
  shortly after the party took office , it changed laws giving poland 's finance ministry the direct power to appoint the head of the broadcaster . 
  the new head is jacek kurski , a member of the law and justice party and a former member of european parliament . 
  hmmm ... why does it sound soooo similar to me ? 
  interesting . 
  interesting because an average child whose parents are doctors and engineers hardly become a religious person unless their parents integrate their own child into both culture or swiss culture . 
  living in minority-majority ( let 's not call it ghetto ) neighbourhoods are also effective to make those children to be undecided on everything ( see : kreuzberg ) . 
  also if their parents are secularists , why do their child/ren want to go to mosque ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  i have n't needed to go to mosque in my entire life lol . 
  countries where turkish diaspora present do n't have the residency laws like switzerland , plus they had open border policy and getting citizenship via marriage was a thing , plus switzerland is serious about swiss culture and way of life . 
  then their parents born elsewhere and not integrated to the swiss society . 
  unless switzerland had open-border policy in 50 's - 70 's , my points still stands . 
  well i 'm sure they 'll deport many of them in the moment they do something against the law or swiss culture . 
  i hope they 'll stay as tourists , seeing news about boys who reject to shake their teachers ' hand and girls who reject to swim with boys are depressing already . 
  the problem is not implementing fines up to 8k sterlin for wearing burka . 
  the problem is what the hell those burka-wearing people do in switzerland ? 
  considering switzerland only accept highly-skilled migrants from eastern countries ** and ** considering the near-impossibility of being highly-skilled and wearing burka , how did those people manage to move to switzerland ? 
  we have non-qur ` an coastline from eastern thrace to aegean and mediterranean if it counts . 
  he has an islamic agenda . 
  sometimes he uses nationalist rhetoric to achieve this agenda that 's all . 
  any person who values muslim arab more than non-muslim turk is anything but nationalist . 
  then do n't give them money . 
  build factories , schools , hospitals , infrastructure by your own in their country . 
  cheaper and more effective . 
  that 's what turkish government do in somalia . 
  it 's all depend on conservative kurdish votes . 
  conservative kurds are very pro-turkey and dislike anything about kurdish seperatism . 
  nowadays hdp seem successfully took the bait and use the same rhetoric with pkk . 
  perfect reason to lose votes . 
  what akp gain by granting syrian citizenship is votes . 
  they want to guarantee their position in elections with them . 
  that was the main reason why tayyip let them in en masse . 
  3 fucking million syrians whom we do n't know anything about . 
  i do n't even talk about the rise of crime , suicide bombings and all that shit that came with them . 
  yet tayyip gives them citizenship because getting votes and high approval rate is the only thing he cares . 
  this is a disastrous move that creates a long-term problem among the society and fuels nationalist parties . 
  but accepting or refusing to accept the genocide is n't rely on academia . 
  governments which recognise the genocide do this for either please the armenian population in their country ( i.e. 
  getting votes ) or sending a message to turkey . 
  governments which refuse to recognise the genocide do this for not to damage the relations or maybe strengthen the relations with turkey . 
  so either side do n't accept or refuse to accept the genocide just because of history . 
  that 's my point . 
  wanting historians to let decide history does n't mean you fall for propaganda . 
  the incidents should named `` genocide '' by historians , not parliaments or governments . 
  otherwise it 'll become a political tool to use for or against something . 
  politicians will say whatever to increase their approval rate , historians not . 
   when you have a powerful state sponsored denial efforts penetrating governments and even academia , if you do nothing about it , ** history will be rewritten . 
  ** you overestimated turkey i see . 
  turkey has n't and wo n't have the power to rewrite history in the forseenable future . 
  thank you so much to those who show solidarity with turkish people !, 
  minister of justice bekir bozda\u011f said 10 people died . . 
  witnesses say there were 2 blast , blasting 2 bombs is isis 's modus operandi . 
  might be tak but this is too big to be done for a group like tak . 
  my apartment building is near e-5 ( main highway ) and i see many ambulances heading to the airport . 
  i hope nobody dies from it . .

  seems like pis decided to be catholic akp/erdo \u011fan . 
  the whole region needs to be ruled by a leader like nasser . 
  he came to power democratically , he has to go democratically . 
  every option other than democratic elections means civil war . 
  redhack has sure burnt so many asses . 
  i do n't see that warning ... yet . 
  because their support from countryside ( both monetary and public ) has been reduced due to successful army operation against them , plus important amount of tribes ( yes i know it 's 2016 but they still have that feudal system over there ) support turkish government/state/army against pkk . 
  rumours that they 're in serious crisis and risk everything to win something from this conflict so we should be ready for anything comes from them . 
  at least foreigners do know about them and do n't believe that they 're just secular democratic freedom fighters \u2122 propaganda . 
   i do n't understand it either but at the same time i do n't understand why the turkish people who vote for the opposition are not against erdogan 's foreign policy decisions . 
  which evidences do you have to back your claim ? 
  because akp foreign policy has been bashed by the opposition very badly , especially the syrian one . 
  % 65 + of people disapproves the government 's syrian policy . 
  the foreign policy with western countries has been critising by the main opposition chp for years . 
  eu-turkey relations , refugee deal , syrian policy , russian jet incident ( erdo 's approval rate got tanked after that for a while ) are first to come into mind . 
  opposition are passive due to its leaders ' lack of ability but claiming people are not opposing his foreign policy is blatant lie . 
  putin has gigantic public support , erdo has 40 % public support at most . 
  united russia gets the most votes because people support them , akp gets the most votes because there 's no centre-right alternative party ; akp absorbed them all . 
  after the coup , the opposition has been weakened yes but so did akp . 
  akp has shit tons of g\u00fclenists within the party and presidential palace due to alliance with them until 2013 . 
  rumours that there 's 80 g\u00fclenist mp 's in akp seats who are able to fall the government via resign because akp now has 313 mp 's and you have to get at least 276 votes to govern alone . 
  i do n't know why people on r/europe and especially on r/worldnews love to talk like he 's muslim brotherhood-tier islamist , his entire voterbase is islamist , he has % 95 public approval , there 's no opposition besides secular democratic kurdish fighters \u2122 , he 's one step behind to turn this country into iran 2.0 etc. 
  i always get angry to see comments like `` rip secular turkey '' when he does or says some stupid thing like the whole nation supports his action . 
  he 's just a populist conservative figure like in rest of the world . 
  how 's the public feelings about this ? 
  will this stir an outrage and/or protests ? 
  edited , thanks . 
  * the police found the id card of harun aslan , alongside with a fake female id card named in the name of `` mahide ata\u015f . '', 
  the police are investigating the possible 3rd terrorist among them . 
  * their goal was to attack the commemoration of [ ankara attack in october 2015 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_ankara_bombings ) , the police claim . 
  * they used 200 kg of ammonium nitrate . 
  * they placed a turkish flag on car to hide themselves from security forces . 
  * the information on them came from diyarbak\u0131r . 
  these are the first infos about the incident . 
  [ source ( in turkish ) ] ( http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ankarada-teror-operasyonu-40242909 ) edit : amount of explosive material . 
  now you know what turkish internet users feel about . 
  you just can not make a conversation without answering stereotypes and shitty memes whether the issue is about turkey or not . 
  also being have to deal with people who blames every brit on sight for brexit is similarly what we 're facing for like 3-4 years . 
  there must be a law which prohibits construction of skyscrapers in and near the old city centre . 
  \u015ei\u015fli district is more than enough for them to build those skyscrapers . 
  city skyline must remain as it is . 
  g\u00fclen and his worshippers are everything but scapegoat . 
  scapegoat means being blamed for something you did n't do . 
  purging every secularist in the state institutions one way or another and filling the positions with their fellows are not actually mean they 're scapegoat . 
  people need to understand ergenekon & sledgehammer trials a.k.a. 
  witch hunt before commenting on g\u00fclen . 
  erdo v g\u00fclen fight is human edition of alien vs predator . 
  probably it will because there 's no job for them in turkey and they fear of being jailed . 
  they will try their chance in elsewhere that 's for sure . 
  i 'm not certain . 
  i hate the government and they use `` g\u00fclenist '' label to fire everyone they do n't like , except secularists because they fear of mass protests . 
  actual g\u00fclenists , academics for peace , alleged pkk supporters a.k.a. 
  leftist but some leftists got their jobs back after complaining . 
  lots of people have been fired for being g\u00fclenist while they are n't , meanwhile , for example , one of the coup plotters brother is an akp mp and still nothing happened to him . 
  i do n't feel sorry for them because they are the reason of removal of secularists in state institutions from 2007 to 2013 . 
  they could 've been purged by a chp government as well , media rhetoric favours them just because they 're the biggest enemy of erdo ; does n't mean they 're good people . 
  about working elsewhere , i think they can work in western europe in condition of guaranteed personal security ; and yes they can can claim asylum for being political refugee because they are openly being persecuted for believing an ideology and it 's dangerous to live here for them . 
  turkey has no unemployed welfare policy , it has on paper but not in reality . 
  aaand no they can not find a job in turkey because they fired for being g\u00fclenist , they may try their luck elsewhere . 
  our governments are sure similar . 
   playing the bigger problems card . 
  hmm , why does it sound so similar to me ? 
   the fact that he gets elected ankara mayor and that many turks believe in what he says , is the sad part . 
  more like rig the elections like there 's no tomorrow by stopping the counting , making interior ministry raid the electoral council then '' '' `` win '' '' '' . 
  i mean , just look at what happened in [ 2014 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ankara_mayoral_election,_2014 ) . 
  melih g\u00f6k\u00e7ek is what happens when erdo + that philippines president combined . 
  money is irrelevant in turkish politics . 
  how many liras akp had before 2002 elections ? 
  or welfare party ? 
  i do n't belong to any political party , if chp can not make their voters party members then it 's their problem , not mine . 
  and the most importantly the delegate selections for party congress is shady as fuck in chp and no , those primaries are for mp 's ; not for leaders . 
  even in those primaries , some mp 's places are guaranteed due to quotas . 
  that 's why you have mehmet bekaro\u011flu in the parliament but not melda onur . 
  chp is corrupt as fuck and will never ever be an alternative to govern turkish republic as long as their whole system stays as it is . 
  yes , i said that basically . 
  in elections , our candidates are : * erdo ( 's puppet ) * useless old fart who has no ability to govern and whom even his party voterbase despise , lost 7 elections , refuses the step back , `` wins '' party congress everytime . 
  * another old fart who ca n't even control himself , helps akp in every chance , refused to form coalition with chp after june 7th elections because he does n't want hdp 's vote of confidence , trying to purge his opponents within the party , lost 11 elections , refuses to step back . 
  * pkk supporter terrorist . 
  it 's not like erdo is putin-tier liked , it 's because opposition is damned . 
  what about ottospeak ? 
  that violent stalin type coup can not take over the government without spain-esque civil war because the state institutions and the most importantly , the military is mixed . 
  what ideology the junta believe plays the key role in that scenerio . 
  i do n't think what will happen though . 
  anti erdo people are daunted and want to move somewhere instead of staying here , pro erdo people act like they are landlords lol , opposition parties have been ruled by useless old farts , tayyip does whatever he wants with his magic wand that 's state of emergency . 
  let 's fill the state institutions with regime friendly ones meanwhile your disapproval rate is higher than approval rate and those who do n't vote for you hate you to the guts . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  tayyip always shits out of his mouth . 
  no need to worry . 
  he probably wanted to attack the republic 's founders , not greece . 
  i hope european statesmen are not completely insane to trust an extremely fragile coalition for building a migrant city . 
  [ which one ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/libyan_civil_war.svg ), 
   libyan government  government welp , that 's the problem . 
  it 's all up to opposition parties at this point . 
  if they continue the status quo within their party , this guy will rule the country until he dies . 
  erdo is unfavourable , opposition figures are even more unfavourable . 
  also on being more autocratic . . 
  unless you are totally insane and want to watch the world burn , you would n't take all the power to yourself in a country where your approval rate is max % 40 ~, 
  i think you are pessimistic and it 's not your fault . 
  if you follow turkey news from western msm , you 'd think that erdo has % 90 public support , just one step behind of being khomeini , opposition is a tiny minority , every erdo supporter is political islamist who also hates secularism and votes for erdo just because islamism , secularism is abolished etc.

   indeed , elsewhere in this thread i have said i 'm not trying to argue equivalence , and the turkish government is fully legitimate in employing the army in kurdish areas to fight pkk . 
  do you expect me to read to your post history so i can develop a good idea of your stance ? 
  and it was you who tried to justify the death of civilians , saying :  can you point to a single civil war or rebellion that did n't involve civilian deaths ? 
  can you point to a single war that did n't involve civilian deaths ? 
  so let me ask you this : do you think ypg is justified in assisting/arming pkk who has and probably will continue targeting civilians ? 
  when did i express support for the killing of civilians ? 
  quote me . 
  i literally said you can not justify civilian killings . 
  you 're basically saying 9/11 is justified because the u.s. has killed civilians before . 
  is it too difficult of a concept for you to understand sometimes both sides can be in the wrong ? 
  you surely would n't be expressing support for pkk if you lost someone you loved to their attacks . 
  deliberately targeting civilians is different from civilian casualties . 
  do n't try to justify terrorism . 
  freedom fighters who murder civilians ? 
  exactly , in which case you should question why russia is not under the blue flag . 
  whether you think turkey is european or not is entirely irrelevant when turkey is a member of coe which uses the same exact flag . 
  i 'm not trying to convince you that turkey is european . 
  you asked why turkey is under the blue flag and i answered . 
  go question why turkey is a member of the coe or whatever , but at this point you 're just blindly arguing when the links you provided answered your own question . 
   i do n't see how i shut down my argument . 
  your argument is that turkey should n't be covered under that blue flag . 
   it does n't change the fact that the flag is meant to symbolize europe well , the flag was first adopted by the council of europe , which turkey is a part of , and is in fact a prominent member . 
  as such , it makes perfect sense that turkey is represented under that blue flag . 
  not in every case , but in many cases such as this one . 
  i 've never said anything about russia . 
  you should instead question why russia is n't on the map rather than why turkey is . 
  the link you sent yourself proved you wrong . 
  russia is already in the council of europe , by the way . 
  council of europe is exclusively european , in that only countries that are at least partially in europe can be members . 
  cyprus is an exception ( also with the eu . ), 
  and apparently , the flag in the image has been adopted by the council of europe first , so you kind of shot down your own argument . 
  as i said before , turkey has been a member of coe for decades and turkish is one of the 5 official languages of coe . 
  [ check  ( http://imgur.com/i0ake8u.jpg ) adopted by council of europe in 1955 . 
  well that flag is n't the flag of europe , it 's the flag of eu . 
  turkey is in the https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_europe and turkish is one of the 5 official languages of the council of europe . 
  this information is just as relevant as the european economic area . 
  why is serbia switzerland and norway under the blue flag ? 
  no worries . 
  yeah , he 's quite the cunt . 
  sadly most turkish people are n't aware that he is in bed with isis ( at least was ) . 
  they 've come to accept whatever he does as perfect and they ca n't even think he would be capable of doing such an hurrendous thing . 
  what makes you say we support isis ? 
  i do n't know a single turkish person who does so . 
  we do n't know if the munich mall shooter was a muslim . 
  he was a breivik sympathizers and took pride in being german , that 's what we do know . 
  he just tried to explain why he would have a machete near himself . 
  way to be a dick . 
  is this really the time ? 
  bu bayanlar travesti mi ? 
  are you suggesting france could deport millions of muslims ? 
  and ending religious freedom is not going to stop people from practicing their religion . 
  stalin tried this , many more have tried it . 
  it will only make the followers more radical . 
  i 'm saying this as someone who acknowledges the evil religion has produced . 
  my condolences , wish it was in my power to help . 
  we do n't hate you but sarkozy had dissed us numerous times , some of us are upset . 
  personally i like france a lot though , paris is probably the city i 've visited the most in europe ( other than istanbul ) . 
  i guess that makes sense , you guys just have a bad rep for it . 
  not fair but it 's how it goes haha , we also have our share of such unfair stereotypes . 
  yeah but a much larger percentage of your population is made up of gypsies , according to your own sources . 
  there are more irish-descent people in mew york than in dublin , for example , but that does n't say much when new york has nearly 20x the population of dublin . 
  edit : i read the articles of the cited sources . 
  none of them say turkey has 4-5 million gypsies . 
  the first sourve explicitly mentions romania has a much bigger gypsy problem than turkey . 
  most turks i know ( including myself , but for genuine reasons ) like poles . 
  seems i 'm wrong . 
  thanks for clarifying . 
  the quote is ironic though considering kurds are just as responsible of the genocide as turks , if not more . 
  does n't mean it 's not not allowed by law to call it a genocide though . 
  but i agree it 's a childish move . 
  for which country ? 
  you mean europe as a whole ? 
  i really doubt it can be anywhere near 8.4 . 
  we need sources . 
  you mean your submission ? 
  i read the article , it does n't say that . 
  not really , i mean i 'm sure there 's more historians that think it 's a genocide but there 's a lot of historians who think otherwise . 
  not saying you 're wrong , but i ca n't find any source that agrees with you . 
  it is not forbidden to call the armenian genocide a genocide in turkey . 
  there 's a difference between government officials addressing the issue personally and the parliament as a whole . 
  individually they may call it whatever they want , i just think it 's wrong for the parliament to make that decision as a whole . 
  also , downvoting me because you disagree with me is not cool . 
  not proper reddit etiquette . 
  what do you think is going to be accomplished by the parliament calling it a genocide ? 
  should n't we leave it to historians to decide ? 
  any such decision made by the parliament will not be objective and will be politically motivated . 
  what exactly would calling it a genocide accomplish ? 
  just like it being illegal to deny the holocaust having happened being a stupid law , so would this be . 
  if i think the holocaust never happened , i should be free to say so . 
  if i think the armenian genocide is in fact not a genocide , that 's also my opinion and the government should n't be telling me to think otherwise , regardless of whether i 'm completely in the wrong or not . 
  what makes you say that ? 
  yeah ? 
  https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/16/germany-prosecuting-satirist-mocks-freedom-speech moreover , it is illegal to deny that the holocaust was a genocide . 
  so much for freedom of speech . 
  75 push-ups in one go or are there breaks in between ? 
  because 75 is a lot , even with training . 
  yeah does n't really take much skill to blow yourself up . 
  there really are n't that many women in pkk anyway , it 's mostly pr as someone else has pointed out . 
  any sources for this ? 
  the east makes up less than a quarter of the population though .

  there are countless small turkish villages along that route that were burnt away , that scene of the movie could be taking place in any of them . 
  i now found the new one you mentioned . 
  i believe it is this one : http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/app/conversion/pdf/?library=echr&amp;id=003-5199806-6438950&amp;filename=grand%20chamber%20judgment%20perincek%20v.%20switzerland%20.pdf i guess the relevant part is :  while in cases concerning statements in relation to the holocaust , the court had -- for historical and contextual reasons -- invariably presumed that they could be seen as a form of incitement to racial hatred , it did not consider that the same could be done in this case . 
  the context did not require automatically to presume that mr perin\u00e7ek 's statements relating to the 1915 events promoted a racist and antidemocratic agenda , and there was not enough evidence that this had been the case . 
  the swiss courts had referred to the fact that he was a self-professed follower of talaat pasha , who was historically the initiator of the massacres of 1915 . 
  however , the swiss courts had not elaborated on this point , and there was no evidence that mr perin\u00e7ek 's membership in the so-called talaat pasha committee had been driven by a wish to vilify the armenians . 
   in the court 's opinion , mr perin\u00e7ek 's statements , read as a whole and taken in their immediate and wider context , could not be seen as a call for hatred , violence or intolerance towards the armenians . 
  it followed that his statements , which concerned a matter of public interest , were entitled to heightened protection under article 10 , and that the swiss authorities had only had a limited room for manoeuvre ( `` margin of appreciation '' ) to interfere with them . 
  it basically says the same thing as the second quoted paragraph in my previous comment . 
  holocaust denial itself is seen as a form of incitement to racial hatred , so it can be criminalized , but there is no such equivalence in the armenian case . 
  it says calls for hatred , violence or intolerance towards the armenians can be penalized , which is reasonable ; many european countries have such hate speech laws . 
  indeed , such a correlation , as in the case of holocaust denial and antisemitism , would not make sense in this case , certainly not in turkey . 
  one of the most pro-armenian academics i know , bask\u0131n oran , refuses to label it as genocide , for example , whereas far right anti-armenian groups would n't have a problem recognizing it as such ( [ and they would be proud of it ] ( http://armenianweekly.com/2015/02/23/celebrating-genocide/ ) ) . 
  if any thing , the correlation is more likely to be the opposite . 
  but they refrained from statements that could be interpreted as comments on the veracity of the genocide label , which i believe was one the things the armenian side wanted in this case . 
   the court thus doubted that there could be a general consensus as to events such as those in issue here , given that historical research was by definition open to discussion and a matter of debate , without necessarily giving rise to final conclusions or to the assertion of objective and absolute truths . 
   in this connection , the court clearly distinguished the present case from those concerning the negation of the crimes of the holocaust . 
  in those cases , the applicants had denied the historical facts even though they were sometimes very concrete , such as the existence of the gas chambers . 
  they had denied the crimes perpetrated by the nazi regime for which there had been a clear legal basis . 
  lastly , the acts that they had called into question had been found by an international court to be clearly established . 
  http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/webservices/content/pdf/003-4613832-5581451 i do think that holocaust denial should not be subject to criminal investigation , but in any case equating the two is blatantly wrong , as the court agrees . 
  ( see bernard lewis 's explanation , for example : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg70uwesfu4 ) this decision of the court upholds the criminalization of the denial of holocaust ( and possibly rwandan genocide ) , but not this one . 
  you 're right , it would depend on how the question is framed . 
  but my observation is , there is a tendency in the us to treat the constitution as a holy scripture , and the constitution very explicitly bans `` cruel and unusual punishment '' . 
  there is some debate as to whether it is acceptable to waterboard people for interrogation , but i think very few would support waterboarding as a punishment . 
  it is not even discussed , because , constitution . 
  as you say , some are ok with unofficial forms of torture as punishment . 
  but if you ask people `` should courts give waterboarding sentences '' or `` should courts give beating sentences '' etc , my guess is the answer would be a strong no , even though there is sizable support for courts giving death sentences . 
  but i have n't seen any polls about those , it 's just my observation . 
  they certainly coexist in europe . 
  there are a lot of people who would support reinstituting death penalty , but they would likely be categorically against torture if you talked to them , which is weird to me , i would have expected the opposite . 
  somehow we all agreed in the sentence `` torture is bad '' , but not so for death penalty . 
  even in the us , supporters of death penalty would be against torture as a punishment , even though there is some support for torturing for interrogation . 
  exactly . 
  i do n't get how the universal condemnation of torture coexists with the controversiality of death penalty . 
  death penalty is on all accords worse idea than torture ( as a punishment ) . 
  while it would be terrible if it turned out that the convict whom we have been torturing was innocent , it is still not as bad as having already killed him . 
  and if you are looking at it from a deterrence/retribution point of view , i think being tortured for life is much more deterrent/retributive than death penalty . 
  you 'd think we would have already scrapped death penalty from the books and debating about whether to abolish torture as a punishment ; i am surprised that we have it the other way around . 
  ( i am not defending torture as a punishment in case it 's not clear , i am saying death penalty is even more irrational . ), 
  akp pretty much consolidated the conservatives , islamists and center-right voters , those groups do n't have a major alternative other than akp . 
  currently , it is two groups , nationalists , and conservative kurds that may or may not vote for akp and decide the election 's fate . 
  nationalists mainly vote akp or mhp , and conservative kurds mainly vote akp or hdp . 
  ( leftist and nationalist kurds vote for hdp anyway , it is the conservative kurds that swing between hdp and akp . ), 
  if akp manages to get votes from either group they may be able to get majority in the parliament and form a government by themselves . 
  at the moment it looks more like they are after the nationalist vote , so the nationalists will be the `` swing vote '' , not kurds . 
  i do n't know any . 
  the concept does n't make much sense for most of europe , actually , because unlike the us , europe mostly uses proportional representation . 
  usually we do n't even call it `` winning a province '' , because it does n't matter , it is only useful for coloring the map . 
  and in elections , the colors usually remain the same , but the proportions determine the outcome . 
  or if the percentages were close , the color sometimes changes in the election , but it does n't make a difference in terms of the number of mps . 
  not to mention , it makes even less sense when you do n't have a two-party system . 
  a party may come the first , but two other parties with similar views might have actually `` won '' the province and got most mps there in total . 
  so i 'd say the concept is mostly an american one , and we do n't have an ohio . 
  but if you are wondering which province 's election results correlate most with overall results , my guess would be istanbul , simply because one fifths of the country 's population lives there and its population consists of people immigrated from every province , so it 's quite statistically representative of the country . 
  if you are not popular in istanbul , you probably are not popular country-wide either . 
  i was about to be enraged , and surprised why i did n't see it in turkish media , so i checked the turkish sources and that 's not what he said at all . 
  [ source in turkish ] ( http://www.trthaber.com/haber/gundem/bakan-erogludan-ankaradaki-patlama-sonrasi-aciklama-208278.html ) [ video ] ( http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/siyaset/385157/akp_li_eroglu_ndan_ankara_daki_patlama_icin_skandal_aciklama.html ) he is n't calling the demonstration as terrorist , he is calling the terrorist attack as terrorist . 
  and he is referring the terrorists as provocateurs , who are trying to disrupt peace before the elections . 
  the only part that could be called scandalous is , he is implying that the attack is made so that akp will lose votes and others ( probably hdp ) will gain votes . 
  so he is implying pkk may have conducted the attack to benefit hdp . 
  he should n't be saying that without proof , it 's horrible , but he did n't say the things in the title . 
  and to give background , bug\u00fcn is a g\u00fclenist newspaper , who used to be fervently pro-akp , and now vehemently anti-akp since g\u00fclen and erdogan had their disagreement . 
  this is not the first time i saw them deliberately mistranslate things . 
  they have my sympathy for finally turning anti-akp , but it is not alright to mislead people to push their agenda . 
  in that case , ` fight ' is the wrong translation . 
  in turkish sava\u015f quite literally means war . 
  let alone things like poverty or drugs , you would n't even say `` war on terror '' in turkish using the word ` sava\u015f ' ( i.e. 
  `` ter\u00f6r ile sava\u015f '' ) , because that word only implies armed conflict between two countries . 
  you would say `` ter\u00f6r ile m\u00fccadele '' - `` the fight against terror '' . 
  ` sava\u015f ' is usually for real war . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/08/us-myanmar-violence-specialreport-idusbre9370ap20130408 you 'd think so , but that does n't appear to be the case at least with buddhism in myanmar . 
  we were europe 's arch-nemesis for centuries . 
  um , no it was n't . 
  turkey was just one of the major players in europe . 
  it formed alliances with some and fought wars with others . 
  sure , it attempted to conquer rest of europe and at times most other european powers united against that . 
  they also united when france tried to do that . 
  they also united against russia . 
  same with germany , etc. 
  if anything , trying to conquer rest of europe was the most european thing turkey ever did , many other european nations also tried and failed . 
  i know where you are coming from , it 's how they teach history in turkey , always this `` us against the whole world '' thinking . 
  enough with it already . 
  i do n't know which europe is it we are the arch-nemesis of , but turkey was sometimes allied and sometimes enemy with uk , sometimes allied and sometimes enemy with france , sometimes allied and sometimes enemy with germany , and mostly enemy with russia . 
  that was exactly what the deleted comment said . 
  did you not read my reply or are you not content with parts of it ? 
  to repeat , the initial post express hopes for a chp-hdp coalition . 
  to which i said that is not possible in short term , but akp-chp is a possibility , even though i would prefer initial post 's suggestion ( chp-hdp ) over that . 
  to repeat , i would prefer chp-mhp coalition over akp-chp or any akp coalition as well . 
  and to repeat , these are just long term speculations , in the short term , there will be either an akp-chp or akp-mhp coalition , or akp single party government , among which i find akp-chp most preferable . 
  sure , if chp gets enough seats in the parliament . 
  but as i said above , there is no way chp + hdp will reach that number in the short term , and chp doing that alone is even more impossible . 
  yeah . 
  it is interesting to think what would happen . 
  turkey would become [ blue on this map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:same_sex_marriage_map_europe_detailed.svg ) when a lot of eu members are still red . 
  * `` but i thought turkey was going islamist !, 
  '' * that 's impossible when akp is in government of course ; the most they would do is agreeing to extend the discrimination law to lgbt as part of a coalition compromise . 
  ( interestingly akp itself proposed such a bill in 2010 , and they later scrapped that part in the parliament . ), 
  what i said was i would prefer chp-hdp coalition to akp-chp . 
  ( he suggested chp-hdp , i said it is impossible in the short term but akp-chp is a real possibility , and while they are both more positive alternatives , i definitely prefer the former . ),

  i 've never heard of these groups lmao must be quite minor . 
  syrian turkmen are not terrorist groups though . 
  do you have proof of the rest of your claims ? 
  syrian turkmen are not terrorists . 
  he 's a pretentious retard ignore him . 
  we 're currently taking care of millions of people and we have been for years now and we have multiple times more than the entirety of europe combined and despite this we are still seen as monsters . 
  does n't seem fair to me when you guys go nuts when you get a few thousand . 
  you know very well that that happened due to people stripping and eating each other out, 
  i actually gave you a very uninterested reply because i thought you did n't want to know . 
  if you do want to know i cna give you a bit more detail of the symbol and who used them and how it ended up where it is today !, 
   turkey is n't politically european , only chp is a european party , hdp is a kurdish party , mhp a party with a central asia and caucasus perspective and akp is a party with the middle east and the muslim world in mind . 
  what does politically european mean to you ? 
   culturally is something hard to define but i consider that a nation like israel is more culturally european . 
  uh how so ? 
   you 're right , when western armenia was owned by armenians it would have been considered europe , but then the genocide happened.the fact is that now it 's controlled by a non european nation . 
  but we are a european nation , in any case they 're even less european than us . 
  it is n't an islamic symbol , the crescent and the star are very old turkic symbols used for millennias, 
  i think it 's more to do with the fact that we put the crescent and star on everything to show ownership of the turks and people just started to assume it was a religious symbol , i 've always found this very bothersome personally ... 
  obviously , but it 's shocking and weird how we have such an image to foreigners , we are just left baffled , why on earth do people think the stuff even listed in op 's post , we just do n't get it . 
   sand boys we do n't have any sand besides at our nice and warm beaches . 
   you are n't geographically european , neither culturally nor politically , that 's not true . 
  turkey is politically and culturally european , as for geographically there would be no question if it was european lands if it was owned by lets say greeks . 
  turkey 's also in the council of europe, 
  same with the turkish population . 
  why do bulgarians smoke so much ? 
  we are our own people ... 
  we really do n't it 's just a few some people bought to make money from tourists, 
  nothing big , just settled in somewhere real nice by the sea side . 
  the old owners were a bit rowdy but we pacified them pretty quickly . 
  hey that 's similar to mine !, 
  mine is 1453, 
   i 'd rather be irrelevant than ** apart ** of turkey . 
  we 'll come back and take your lands again soon buddy , do n't worry . 
   i do n't understand this . 
  brother i know the feeling, 
  well we do n't have camels but people come to turkey and want to see camels so in touristic places you 'll see 1-2 camels in the whole town because these people buy these to make bank from tourists who visit . 
  in turkish now deve guresi ( camel wrestling ) means two people on each others shoulders trying to push two other people on each other 's shoulders off lol :d, 
  no no i was n't mad but there really is a strangely distorted view of our country , i do n't think we have any proper soft power to project ourselves in a proper light and everyone goes by assumptions through proximity ... 
  thank you for your kind words though i appreciate it , 
  what the fuck kind of image do you guys have of us ? 
  have you been to turkey ? 
  putin and erdo\u011fan are similar but i 'm sure you hate erdo\u011fan for the same reasons you love putin right ? 
  they 're both toxic and cancer and need to be removed . 
  i do n't get why they think foreigners work by a hive mind . 
  you said it so you 're muslim now . 
  oh it 's great when created with the right method with the right cup and the right leaves . 
  be sure it 's not a knock off . 
  we like it strong . 
  we call it rabbits blood . 
  having real tea must have shocked you . 
  in case you did n't know you guys call it that cause of the cyprus issue just like how americans started calling french fries freedom fries when they got mad at the frenchies . 
  it 's as strong as we want it because we 're not using tea bags , instead we have a [ kettle ] ( http://www.turkishcookbook.com/images/prep/turkcayi_prep_1.jpg ) with the top part filled with tea leaves and water and the bottom with just water and the top part heats up with the steam of the bottom one and then you pour into a cup and adjust how strong you want it . 
  lol , but really it 's as strong as we want it because we 're not using tea bags , instead we have a [ kettle ] ( http://www.turkishcookbook.com/images/prep/turkcayi_prep_1.jpg ) with the top part filled with tea leaves and water and the bottom with just water and the top part heats up with the steam of the bottom one and then you pour into a cup and adjust how strong you want it . 
  we mainly have uht milk . 
  that 's cause you guys are n't drinking uht milk . 
  that shit is gross . 
  why am i a turkish nationalist ? 
  this has nothing to do with nationalism , you made a cringe worthy nonsensical post . 
  they were doing that to us too but you do n't see us bitching and moaning about it , we have our burdens and we have to take care of these unfortunate people . 
  obviously there 's going to be shitty ones among them but to disregard them as a whole is inhumane and such a horrible thing . 
  what makes them more trustworthy than turkey ? 
  we 've been using billions of dollars on refugees already and we need the extra support . 
  people treat these human lives as if they 're nothing and i find that really shocking , what 's wrong with people ? 
  damn , i did n't know greek girls had such stone cold hearts . 
  nice sense of humanity you have there . 
  i 'm ok with the churches for example being called their proper names i guess as a historical continuation but i believe things should be called what they are in that language than your own , the other way around i find odd/unnecessary and frankly stupid ... 
  i do n't know enough about kos to explain its name but as you know istan also means the land of , so it might have to do with that . 
  most name changes were really to suit the turkish tongue that 's why . 
  the `` i '' is added to the start because in turkish two consonants ca n't really be side by side and this why the first letter of the `` to the city '' in greek thing does n't make sense . 
  like sparta becomes isparta because people ca n't say sparta ( the other alternative would be siparta ) . 
  you get what i mean ? 
  what language are we speaking ? 
  does that matter ? 
  the official name of the city now is istanbul . 
  istanbul is not constantinople , it is not konstantiniyye , it is not asitane , it is not byzantium , it is not tsargrad . 
  it 's stupid to call it anything but what its name is . 
  constantinople was a really tiny speck in comparison to what istanbul is now , it ca n't even really be compared . 
  i like to call the city by the name they had during its period . 
  constantinople pre-ottomans , konstantiniyye post-ottomans , istanbul post 1923 . 
  we do n't like that either , we call it by what it was and we call the land anatolia . 
  it 's okay when it says `` now modern day turkey '' or something that 's fine . 
   istanbul is a greek phrase , just turcified . 
  this is a myth , it 's stupidly accepted by people though . 
  that 's stupid though why not call something by its name ? 
  but it ** is ** eastern turkey . 
  this comment is so stupid i ca n't believe anyone would even write such a thing . 
  i do n't think you caught my sarcasm ... 
  i hope we get to give them our refugees and just be done with it already . 
   the turkish army never kills in the single digits . 
  they do though , but you are n't really following anything are you ? 
  muvaffakiyetsizle\u015ftiricile\u015ftiriveremeyebileceklerimizdenmi\u015fsinizcesine ** translation : **  `` as though you happen to have been from among those whom we will not be able to easily/quickly make a maker of unsuccessful ones '' obviously it 's a word we use all the time , it 's so common . 
  yep . 
  it does n't . 
  fuck you wrote a lot . 
   when you have a confrontation with somebody and he somehow `` loses '' , your chances are pretty good that some minutes later the rest of the male family members will come for you , no matter if you were in the right . 
  what ? 
  are you saying they bring a gang of their friend to fight ? 
  that does n't happen in turkey , if a fight breaks out it 's a one on one and even so i 've rarely ever seen a fight , just the 1-2 a school year . 
  i 've never seen a gang up fight in my life but it does n't seem like much to complain about . 
   or this obsession about the `` honour '' of mothers .

b a n t e r a n t e r, 
  they are totally different regarding their politics in western and eastern turkey . 
  they obviously target different audiences , so in western turkey they come up with progressive ideas ( such as pro lgbt eg . 
  ) , which is great and earns them votes from progressive citizens . 
  in eastern turkey they go by separatist-nationalist anti-turkish rhetorics . 
  their target audience there are kurdish nationalists . 
  to earn their votes over there they say stiff like ` we will build a statue of \u00d6calan ' , ` the pkk would only need to spit to make the turkish army drown ' . 
  demirta\u015f also attended several times families of terrorist who killed soldiers and civilians and issued his support for them . 
  hdp knows that western turkey is not interested in their separatist-terrorist bullshit , and they clearly know that in eastern turkey they would be told to fuck off if they came up with their pro-lgbt topics . 
  and hdp officials attended her funeral . 
  pricks . 
  saw a man saying that voting yes will help turkey to become stronger and better , and not turn into another middle east country like syria or iraq . 
  funnily , assad and saddam have been presidents who had ultimate powers which dictator tayyip wants as well . 
  the beauty in having ultimate powers is that you wo n't be prosecuted and you wo n't be challenged . 
  so you can continue with your corruption without any issues . 
  the current constitution was created after the 1980 coup . 
  but you 're right with your first point . 
  many akp supporters do n't know what they 're voting for and they do n't care . 
  as long as they 're doing what their leader wants them to do , they do n't need to know what they 're doing . 
  shakira law coming to europe amirite ? 
  america supported bin laden and the taliban . 
  america supported the coup in 1980 in turkey which led to the downfall of socialism in turkey and paved the way for islamists . 
  america destabilised the middle east by toppling saddam which eventually led to region-wide crises . 
  america supported and armed syrian rebels which would lead to a civil war over there , to the complete destruction of syria , the formation of isis , thousands of deaths and mass emigration into turkey and western europe . 
  america still supports saudi arabia , the ones which fund global jihadism . 
  and this is only about this certain region . 
  conquered by whom and how ? 
  do n't be silly . 
  there is definitely a problem but european countries will not be conquered by islamist . 
  it all started when the yanks started supporting and funding islamist to counter leftists . 
  now , due to the age of information radicals are more likely to get affected by the call for jihad . 
  i 'm becoming desensitised if i 'm brutally honest . 
  but every time , it 's just so shocking to see dead people who were just minding their business . 
  not gon na lie , these kind of videos will only help tayyip more and more and it 's full of generalisations . 
  it 's not even funny , but typical german/austrian humour . 
  religion = mental illness confirmed . 
  the irish alphabet , i 'm not quite familiar with it , is very different . 
  maybe if read it would sound quite similar . 
  for example ` tiocfaidh ar la ' is a phrase i 'm similar with , and the first word is pronounced something like choocky ( short oo though ) . 
  it seems like different languages can have the same words but with different meanings attached . 
  my dad 's an atheist , my mum 's a cultural muslim ( did n't pray more than ten times in the last five years ) , so it 's fine , but i was raised as muslim , was never really religious , but at some point due to depression and the search for the meaning of life i tried to seek comfort in religion and read the quran in a language i understand for the first time , became an atheist within 48 hours . 
  long story short , if you are an atheist and are rather surrounded by secular people ( muslim or irreligious ) , it does n't matter among your circle but you might break one 's heart if he/she feels his/her religious feelings to be attacked . 
  however the older folks would not like to hear what i have to say . 
  but there 's a reason i say it freely anonymously , but would never do so outside or on facebook eg . 
  how do you expect me to remain neutral when this ideology is the biggest threat to our democracy ? 
  islam in itself is political and therefore it 's not just a religion . 
  he said that he does n't want people to idolise statues . 
  yet he would see nothing wrong in walking around and praying towards a cube in mekka , muslims are hypocrites regarding this . 
  they are doing shirk on a daily basis but lack the understanding of questioning . 
  what a sad piece of shit this person is . 
  islam is cancer . 
  a kurdish iraqi to be exact . 
  whatever , my point is that you can blame surely your educational system . 
  but if after fourteen years you fail to say your age in that language which you should consider to be your first language , then you have to blame yourself as well . 
  well , it 's obvious that , again , people find it more convenient to speak english than irish , that 's sad . 
  sad if people can not give a fuck about their own language . 
  the ` well we were oppressed by the english ' excuse does n't count when the youths reject irish because it is n't as convenient as english . 
  look what israel has done with hebrew, 
  in ottoman turkish the city was also called be\u00e7 . 
  bruv , god works in mysterious ways . 
  also you 're a filthy kuffar and need to convert to islam if you want god to take you seriously . 
  alternatively , you can convert to tengriism and pray to tengri .

  you said  you have to be in the eu to use the euro as a national currency .

  that 's not true , monaco is not in the eu as well . 
  having bilateral agreements do not mean that one country is part of that supranational organisation , your comments are ignorant . 
  and also to chad . 
  th\u0131s \u0131s what happens when a bunch of uneducated almond mustached \u2122 goatfuckers rule your country . 
  so turks should , but kurds should n't . 
  alright . 
  why should thracian turks from \u0130ske\u00e7e live under greek law ? 
  the world would be better without racism . 
  and i hope that you 're going to get excluded from discussions on this platform with your racist agenda . 
  that 's not an answer to my question . 
  go somewhere else with that turcophobic shit you 're on . 
  turkey would never have been eu member anyway , it sucks for turkish cypriots , but greek cyprus can not become part of nato for example . 
  so greeks made it worse for cypriots altogether, 
  why should turks live under greek rule ? 
  that 's not how self-determination works . 
  there is also the erenk\u00f6y resistance , when greek cypriots attacked an enclave of turkish cypriots for days until turkish jets intervened . 
  barbarians !, 
  the last one ruling the country who had balls . 
  he said fuck you to american embargos and threats , and did what was right for turkish people . 
  we need a leftist leader for our country , the wankers of akp are just busy pocketing as much as they can . 
  they did the same in crimea . 
  the local population , the crimean tatars , were killed or deported to central asia , and became replaced by ethnic russians . 
  more than half a century later , the russians invaded crimea because of ` muh oppressed local russians ' . 
  they should not have been there in the first place .

  tengri \u0131s great . 
  tengriism \u0131s the old g\u00f6kt\u00fcrk religion based on tengri , the sky god , the name tengri has been adopted in modern anatolian turkish as ` tanr\u0131 ' which means ` god ' .

  you can call my mother a cunt , but do n't call me arab , reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  you have to keep in mind that turkey has 8 times the population of hungary , so things happen on a larger scale . 
  however the methods are similar and that 's what counts . 
  only a few years ago we were there where hungary is now , and look at us now . 
  the same could happen with hungary . 
  same for turkey .

  hypocrisy of erdogan . 
  any evidence about your claim ? 
  nope . 
  erdogan is all talk . 
  ataturk 's vision is democratic . 
  m. kemal atat\u00fcrk laid the foundations of a truly modern turkey , a democratic , republican and independent state based on national sovereignty . 
  although these ideas originated from him and were paramount in the foundation of the new state they remain today an integral part of the republican government of our country . 
  the foundation stone , or perhaps even the very soul of atat\u00fcrk 's spiritual and intellectual philosophy , was the thought of universal peace and although the biggest part of his life was taken up by war to defend his country , he always considered it a crime . 
  `` authority , without any condition and reservation , belongs to the nation . '' -- mustafa kemal atat\u00fcrk `` my people are going to learn the principles of democracy the dictates of truth and the teachings of science . 
  superstition must go . 
  let them worship as they will , every man can follow his own conscience provided it does not interfere with sane reason or bid him act against the liberty of his fellow men . '' -- mustafa kemal atat\u00fcrk https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mustafa_kemal_atat%c3%bcrk#establishment_of_the_republic_of_turkey http://www.atam.gov.tr/dergi/sayi-19/ataturk-populism-and-democracy, 
   that 's your problem . 
  i do n't care about the turkish referendum . 
  then europeans must stop whining about democracy in turkey . 
  okay . 
  lies hurts too . 
  you are not funny . 
  pkk is a terrorist organization and a national threat for all turkish people . 
  + kurds are not massacred by turks . 
  yes , it 's a choice . 
  there wo n't be civil war . 
  get out and talk with some \u00e7omars . 
  majority of them wo n't support civil war . 
  you know that they ca n't attack people randomly . 
  even majority of \u00e7omars wo n't accept civil war . 
  you are exaggerating . 
   is this looks like passive to you ? 
  yes . 
   there are so much more \u00e7omars than us and government forces will be against us too , yes , but seculars do n't give up without a fight .

  there will be a lot of dead . 
  well , i wo n't fight . 
  you can fight alone then . 
   yes , they mostly are . 
  those events can be easily another discussion tho , what i really pointed was mara\u015f , \u00c7orum , sivas and other massacres , ones they killed and burned alive their own citizens just because they think they are not religious enough . 
  it 's because agression of armenian gangs etc. 
  there wo n't be civil war in turkey . 
  you 're exaggerating . 
  have you ever talked to people around you ? 
  kemalists , secularists ... are very passive people . 
  you are on propaganda mission . 
  you are racist . 
  i accept crimes of turkey as well . 
  but i wo n't accept lies and biased informations .

  i have been to europe many times , and i do n't agree with ` europe is extremely racist ' statement . 
  maybe it is the amount of hate i see in my country , but still , it is an exaggeration . 
  no cyprus ? 
  turkey would be uk/russsia/france / greece if it was included . 
  well , anatolian culture has n't changed much in last 1000 years . 
  only language and religion . 
  have n't been in so many european countries ( mostly been around baltic sea ) but , i can say budapest-hungary . 
  old grand buildings from glorious times , meaty soups and salamis , people with very mixed genetics , people on the street who want to trick tourists , lots of beggars , ottoman tombs and hamams . . yep sounds like istanbul . 
  everybody is `` temel '' there . 
   the people of the eastern black sea region are also known for their  wit and sense of humour ; in fact many jokes in turkey are told about  the natives of the black sea region karadeniz f\u0131kralar\u0131 ( black sea  jokes ) . 
  the character temel , a universal buffon figure found in many  cultures , forms an important part of the turkish oral tradition . 
  i think there is also a general distaste for turkey governments in northern cyprus . 
  2004 european cup , the picture of charisteas scoring the header would look very cool :p, 
  dude . . 
  it 's the olive oil . 
  alevis are under shia sect of islam and they have been massacred by sunni ottomans/turks/kurds periodically in anatolia since 16th century . 
  ottoman sultan selim i massacred thousands of alevis , and erdogan praises selim a lot in his speeches and actions ( wants to give the name `` yavuz sultan selim '' to the 3rd bridge of istanbul ) , and as a reaction to the islamist sunnis , alevis living in the cities have a high tendency to become secularists or atheists . 
  1 - football ( it 's huge , people kill each other for that shit ) 2 - basketball ( became more popular after 90 's ) 3 - volleyball ( women 's seem to be more popular ), 
  at least 40 % of the country would cheer if he dies painfully . 
  if this guy would have seen walking alone anywhere in western ( thracian , aegean , mediterranean ) or alevi ( dersim , alevi vilages in anatolia ) areas in turkey he would be killed violently by the mob of ` ordinary ' people . 
  that 's why he walks with an army of bodyguards . 
  i heard he is a relative of varg vikernes ' family . 
  anti-islam middle asia descendant turk . 
  ( i 'd go pagan too , if i would believe in magic ), 
  because everyone you talked with can speak a foreign language . 
  actually it is the opposite . 
   undemocratic ( counting the journalists in prison ) yes , very much  islamic state not there yet . 
  not while we are still living in this country . 
  although things are very undemocratic , there is nothing on the constitution that makes turkey an islamic state . 
  many people are islamic , people from the government are islamic but the state is not . 
  turkey would be the largest but not would be the most powerful country in eu . 
  there is germany , france and g.britain . 
  european countries really should have some anti-islamic laws , like we used to have . 
  i think chp is secular nationalist , and mhp is muslim nationalist . 
  people in izmir are liberal in their lifestyles , not in their political views . 
  most people are very nationalist . 
  chp is the most popular secular option , but this time they tried to get some `` conservative '' votes with dickmeleddin . 
  ihsanoglu is just an islamist without `` corruption '' . 
  for me , being him corruption-free does not change anything . 
  i would never vote for such a person . 
  instead i voted for kurdish party , even though i am coming from a very turkish background , and have very less sympathy to their movements . 
  i just voted for them because there was two islamist guys and a kurdish ( zaza ) guy who tells he wants to close the religious institution ( diyanet ) which got more than 2 billion dollars budget from the state for 2014 . 
  edit : spelling . 
  it was good against islamists but it was very bad for kurds . 
  because all the generals in army were also very very nationalist . 
  i think r/europe has a tendency to call `` kebab '' everyone under 40th latitude . 
  a good way to destroy lives . 
  lol, 
  no i do n't know . 
  please tell me . 
  why ? 
  what should i call it ? 
  east thrachia is not in europistan ? 
  dat feeling when turkey is not included :(, 
  i do n't know for jews , but here it became more of a cultural thing . 
  even being very secular , a turkish woman might want her partner to get circumcised , just because she thinks circumcision is the `` natural way '' or other one is gross . 
  it is same with eating pork , many people drinks alcohol but nearly none of them eat pork , because it 's `` unhealty '' and `` not clean '' . 
  why do we need them to teach religion at school ? 
  should n't it be family 's responsibility ? 
  see , what kind of idiots we deal with in this country ? 
  i always thought that macarena was from south america . 
  if you are refering to greeks and armenians in anatolia . 
  they were not immigrants , they were original inhabitants of anatolia . 
  yeah , they all seemed fantastic but plane was 2.5 times cheaper . 
  fly to berlin from istanbul , fly to copenhagen from berlin , go to malm\u00f6 from copenhagen ( with bus i suppose ) , go to stockholm from malm\u00f6 with train , then fly back to istanbul . 
  just to give some info : sunni is classical islam , like they have in egypt or palestine ( although there is a lot of turkish pov ) . 
  alevi is a weird mixture of shia and old turkic paganism . 
  `` lulz '', 
  to steal honest european people 's jobs .

  yeah , it 's probably in our genes . 
  here in turkey we call our fat bellies `` turkish muscle '', 
  this is almost a fact , and the fact here is hateful , not his speech . 
  never !,

  if there are muslims somewhere ; even by the smallest power they have , they will try to make their way and try to force other people to it .

  i bet it 's muslims, 
  i really lost my all hope about the votes in last election . 
  akp only does it to save their screwed up reputation in international politics . 
  akp has the smilar ideologies with genociders : clearing non-muslims from turkey . 
  edit : reputation `` in international politics '', 
  whenever this subject comes up i feel very sad and very furious . 
  i am very sad for what happened ( also to anatolian greeks and assyrians ) and get even more sad when i imagine how much culture we 'd have if did n't lose these people . 
  i feel very furious because , i feel very guilty about something i did n't do and would never do .

  that hardcore kemalist `` kafatas\u00e7\u0131 '' ( skuller ? ), 
  mentality mostly died out . 
  it 's true mhp is n't all that secular . 
  they are still less religious than akp . 
  this is just giving a message to muslims that they are not wanted . 
  most of them do n't feel murdery when they see drawings like this . 
  they just feel like how a european would feel if they saw an anti-lgtb march or nazi march or something . 
  they feel that they are not wanted . 
  this is n't going to help them integrate . 
  it even radicalizes the moderates . 
  drawing muhammed to make a joke is something , drawing him to provoke muslims is another . 
  nobody does shit like this to `` celebrate '' free speech . 
  it 's childish . 
  this is my opinion as an atheist who grew up among muslims . 
  islam may be fucked up , but the west is n't helping . 
  people are already angry . 
  fucking their prophet with dildos or invading their lands is n't going to fix anything . 
  it 's good that some westerners see this , at least . 
  people are milking this nicely . 
  killing civilians does n't seem like self-defense . 
  i can find the page where pkk brags in their own newspaper about killing the relatives of a village ranger . 
  or you can read serxwebun yourself and actually research the history of the group you are talking about . 
  all that `` for the people '' ( aka for us ) and `` liberating enemy resources '' ( aka stealing weapons ) communist jargon will make your head go numb after a while though . 
  in short , bi siktir git . 
  greek side rejected the annan plan and i do n't think it 's going to resurface again anytime soon . 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  i always get around the internet blocks so i literally have no idea about internet censorship lol . 
  gaining access to all blocked websites at once takes like one minute . 
  even erdo\u011fan once said `` i can enter youtube , and so can you . '', 
  racism in turkey focuses more on identity rather than that weirdo stuff . 
  that 's a really small faction . 
  turkey ca n't afford to attack an ally at any hypothetical scenario whatever the gains may be . 
  we see greece as a friendly country and any military action would n't exactly make the people happy . 
  especially when we got syria and to mess with . 
  also , interior instability . 
  do n't trust wikipedia when it comes to turkey . 
  half of it is bullshit . 
  they say hdp is a green party i mean what the flying fuck . 
  not that i like mhp or anything . 
  i 'd say they are `` normal '' right . 
  although this left-right thing does n't really work for categorizing turkish parties . 
  right and left is an obsolete concept . 
  bah\u00e7eli can be stupid and idealist sometimes but at least he cleared the violent nationalist thugs from the streets . 
  at least everything can be blamed on akp and mhp when inevitably they fuck it up . 
  they 'll take the fall and chp and hdp will have room to grow . 
  if they did that , they would lose every speck of kurdish votes they have now . 
  akp is in a tight situation , so they might just do that . 
  but giving the corrupted ministers a fair and just trial is something akp will never accept . 
  touching those snowflakes would bring down a fucking avalanche . 
  akp-mhp coalition will lead to akp losing votes to mhp , and mhp voting votes to chp . 
  at least they would lose power . 
  one side of me wants them to take power so they can take the fall when everything comes down . 
  but dude , beer :(, 
  pretty accurate but imho ,  chp/mhp/hdp hate each other ( nearly ) as much as they hate akp chp and mhp does n't hate each other that much . 
  some mhp voters dislike chp for being welcoming towards hdp and some chp voters now dislike mhp for going fuck-all towards coalition possibilities . 
  not chp and hdp either . 
  mhp does n't hate akp too . 
  mhp frequently gave their support to akp . 
   mhp voter base hates akp and erdogan not really . 
  there are a lot of similarities with mhp and akp voter base . 
  mhp would rather ally with akp than be in a coalition that has hdp 's support in any way . 
  sure , they would lose some voters , but most people will be happy with mhp not giving hdp any ground . 
   nope , theyve never supported terrorism [ kek ] ( http://pkkningercekyuzu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hdpnin-7-haziran-2015-se%c3%a7imlerinde-kullanmas%c4%b1-gereken-as%c4%b1l-reklam-filmi-9.jpg ) and its ' [ top ] ( http://store.donanimhaber.com/0b/05/d8/0b05d86f7e011513d7bbaa34333b28f9.jpg ), 
  does it matter why the congolese were targeted ? 
  if we were the ones that caused the death of 10 million congolese , i 'm sure people would remember it as a genocide . 
  well , it was the armenian `` group '' that was rebelling and trying to secure a state out of ottoman empire by collaborating with russia . 
  of course armenians were going to be targeted . 
  belgium targeted the congolese as a group why is n't that called a genocide ? 
   edit : found a map . 
  not genociding armenians might have led to a large loss of territory in the east , land that is now firmly part of turkey . 
  yes , but now kurds live there and they stake a claim to that area . 
   there was no genocide . 
   the reason millions of congolese were killed was not because of their ethnic or religious background , nor was it the result of an official or unofficial campaign to eliminate their group ; rather , the measures that led to all those deaths had profit as their sole goal and oppressed the local populations to achieve it , using very violent , inhumane measures . 
  and ottoman empire killed armenians during deportation . 
  ottoman empire killed armenians while killing revolters . 
  armenians living in the west were untouched . 
  yet the world accepts this as a genocide . 
  a deliberate act to exterminate a particular race . 
  why the one in congo is n't accepted as a genocide ? 
  10 million people died . 
   it was not a genocide . 
  a genocide is the killing people with the intention of removing their ethnicity from a certain area . 
   they were n't killed because they were congolese that sounds exactly like turkish denialists . 
  armenians living in the west were untouched but ours is still called a genocide . 
  yours sounds like a genocide to me too , in that sense . 
  never hurts to repeat it every once in a while to keep people happy . 
  i know how people go `` turkey is not european '' in any thread about turkey , but bravo to you sir for starting this discussion in a thread like this . 
  but i do n't think we are european too , to be honest . 
  our plot seems to be proceeding well . 
  soon , everyone will embrace kebab !, 
  ca n't believe you got downvoted for this joke lol, 
   fucking minarets [ hehehe ] ( https://i.imgur.com/p0x669g.jpg ) that kid drawing space rockets sounds really cute btw . 
  why would they fear us ? 
  why would we attack our allies ? 
   does this mean that you do n't care about people suffering anywhere else than your immediate vicinity ? 
  no , i do n't think so . 
  it only means that news outlets will present news that are of interest to their average reader . 
  so , the news showing turkey in a bad light holds more interest to an average western reader ? 
  because it 's not like turkey never makes headlines in western media , unless they did something bad . 
  we all heard all about how evil turkey is barring refugees from entering their lands , but what about this news article ?

  also ban pets , people get bit by them . 
  do n't forget putting pillows instead of asphalt so people do n't get hurt when they fall !!, 
  scratch that , just ban anyone going outside , also ban ovens and gas heating !, 
  ! 11 think of the children !!, 
  yes , many turks temporarily migrate to countries in eastern europe to study because it 's just as good as turkish universities but much cheaper in every way . 
  we hate everyone, 
  hmm , i 'm pretty sure anatolia is originally anatolian , like we are . 
  meem , meme sounds like boobs in turkish . 
  err , i would n't call that a case of `` remaining in power '' . 
  nah , people would look at you weird though . 
  do stay away from booze in public places though , that 's just dumb . 
  i do n't think the refugee crisis has ruined our reputation . 
  other stuff ( you know what i mean ) has kind of made us look alot worse . 
  bleh , no way . 
  cars are awful to sit in for more than 20 minutes . 
  turkey , azerbaijan , greece , russia , germany , france , spain , italy , britain , sweden . 
  i feel '' `` pride '' '' if you could call it that over the history of the anatolian people and how we basically headed two of the most powerful empires in history for like 1500 years . 
  as for buildings , i didi n't build it so ... 
  last sultan was mehmed vi , he was exiled and died in italy . 
  no one cares about him . 
   except for population . 
  i was about ready to find you irl , but you corrected yourself !, 
  people are kind of racist in the way that they basically have this view of blacks as being socially inferior , i.e everybody treats them badly and they 're disliked in western society . 
  alot of jokes are towards that extent . 
  but i would n't say most people are necessarily negative towards black people though , especially people who 've seen roots where the slave was a muslim . 
  netherlands is the most different european country . 
  it 's just very disturbing how they are okay with so euthanasia for people with mental disease . 
  that would never fly here . 
  also their chill attitude to stuff is basically the opposite of turkey . 
  as for non-european , probably something like bhutan . 
  only similarity is mountains . 
  i mean you guys already have troops in korea and afghanistan ? 
  i do n't know too much about american politics but trump probably wants to look like he 's not a russian toady . 
  finland does n't actually exist , but that 's not really a conspiracy it 's just called a conspiracy by the fishing industry . 
  no , i do n't really think that way . 
  let us in sempai please save us, 
  why ? 
  why not ? 
  fairly standard beauty-wise . 
  but most people tend to go for foreign looking women since they are much easier than turks , lol . 
  i have no idea what she was up to tbh , she 'd look attractive without the beard . 
  do n't really care too much , unless they come in huge numbers like the arabs have recently . 
  there are a shitton of foreigners living in istanbul that do n't really conform , and that 's just fine by us . 
  most of the foreigners coming here are very fond of turkish culture however , so that 's another reason why they might not be as annoying as some immigrants in the west are . 
  it 's probably the most powerful malicious organization there has ever been , so he 's technically correct . 
  nazis or stalin didi n't own ( or have the potential to own ) that big of a share of the worlds power and gdp . 
  motherland, 
  agreed , people are being russophobic as usual . 
  just move along . 
  topkek , i misread the title . 
  cyprus edit : i fucking thought it was `` non-european country '' , fuck me . 
  insult both ataturk and islam regularly , we love some bantz . 
  also if you 're in istanbul make sure to constantly remind people you hope the people are shot in the back of the head by neo-crusaders at some point in the future . 
   plenty of far more hated leaders have remained in power . 
  such as ? 
  its pretty hard to rule when 50 % hate you , even harder if you take away democratic means to take you down . 
  most regular turks on reddit use r/europe and r/askeurope too , if you were n't aware . 
  honestly , even after so many years of total control over what is fed to our people , and playing literally every card there is , including finally attacking our allies . 
  even after all of this , he had to cheat to win . 
  i doubt he will last long . 
  so really , it could have been worse . 
  i feel fine , just slept badly last night . 
  not due to ww2 atleast . 
  edit : of course the whole holocaust thing is seen negatively , but no one really cares about that since it was so long ago . 
  i do n't care really , unless they drop it on civilians . 
  just big and the harem stuff, 
  most asian country in europe, 
  it was topkapi , just due to how ridiculous it was . 
  jeez what, 
  they kinda take liberalism to the extreme , with people being able to request assisted suicide for mental suffering and so on . 
  makes me shudder honestly . 
  scandinavia is pretty different too , but the other two are n't as distant as the former ones . 
  i feel bad for the poor syrians that ended up in slovenia , genuinly seems like a nasty place for them . 
  from what i 've seen , the nationalist right wing is sort of outnumbered pretty hard . 
  so do n't worry until you get to our level of polarisation . 
  unstable politics, 
  i ate eggs tomatoes sucuk and feta on dark bread, 
  nah , might visit but roadtrip just sounds horrible . 
  we 're not used to sitting in a car all day like some americans might be . 
  it 's called the european union . 
  i do n't see any problem in changing it 's name and including other continents though , but that would have to be far in the future . 
  that 's like saying that the ottomans were exclusively european because the asian territories were peripheral compared to rumelia . 
  or that byzantium were exclusively asian because the balkans bit was peripheral compared to anatolia . 
  russia is obviously european though . 
  well , not africa but the middle east . 
  that line didi n't exist until fairly recently anyway . 
  it was just islam vs christianity , and later varying degrees of `` oriental '' . 
  well , yours was a bit more recent . 
  i do n't see any french still salty about the occupation of paris , unlike serbs who are salty about basically their whole history . 
  nah , that 's not because we hate eachother . 
  it 's not fair to give ottoman heritage exclusively to turks , greeks were a huge part of it too and the coffee can accurately be called both greek and turkish coffee . 
  turkey and greece is mostly fine tbh . 
  we do n't have any specific rivalry but rather just a massive amount of salt ( like all ex-ottoman states ) combined with sevres syndrome and national narcissism . 
  yeah maybe a bit . 
  usually among ultra-nationalists . 
  lol , have you been to east/south east europe at all ? 
  if you look at usernames , most of the people in the islam related threads are not the same as the normal users . 
  t_d and other americans pour into those threads , often disguised with european flairs , or just downvoting anything going against the circlejerk . 
  benelux, 
   general opinion of americans,

i do n't know if it still stands but that link only describes the current building and tells that `` it got disused after 1922 as there no orthodox community left . 
  it managed to survive until today because it was included into military area . '', 
   the only groups who have maintained some sort of ethnic identity differen to that of mainstream turkish are those groups that had become muslim before the ottomans ( kurds , circassians , tatars etc ) . 
  what is really odd is that some of them actually preserved their identity ( with various degrees ) yet still considers themselves turks . 
  as an example , a friend of mine is from a georgian muhacir ( refugee ) family . 
  he call himself georgian , considers his muslim identity above anything but he and his whole family are also hardcore supporters of mhp ( nationalist party ) . 
  here , i had found it in the past ;  when the island was occupied by greek navy [ in 1912 ] , greek soldiers were sent to villages and stationed themselves in the public squares . 
  some of us children ran to see what these greek soldiers , these hellenes , looked like . 
  `` what are you looking at ? '', 
  one of them asked . 
  `` at hellenes , '' we replied . 
  `` are you not hellenes yourselves ? '' he retorted . 
  `` no , we are romans '' . ^ [ source ] ( https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=iws0lh57nvwc&amp;lpg=pp1&amp;pg=pa42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ), 
  they were mostly turkified . 
  ottoman [ millet system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/millet_ ( ottoman_empire \\ ) ) meant that people were inside clearly defined groups based on religious affiliation . 
  adopting islam required change of whole lifestyle and leaving your community and joining another . 
  when a large community changed religion ( like albanians ) then preserving identity was easier but when it happened gradually , only choice was assimilation to larger one ( turks ) . 
  adding to this turkish ethnicity is quite adaptable and diverse thus it 's easier to be accepted by turks than greeks whom were quite exclusive . 
  also considering turkish lang . 
  ( either turks or palace educated people who got turkified ) dominated government bureaucracy , you can see how desireable it 's to adapt turkish and join the state apparatus . 
  as far as i know there were no big migration of greeks ( or anyone really ) until after ww1 . 
  how is it jewish ? 
  just because jews also use same name does n't mean anything . 
  kaplan literally means tiger in turkish . 
  and it 's a common surname . 
  is n't that how you have been acting all the time ? 
  how many years has it been since you have been dangling that eu membership carrot ? 
  how many of your demands we had to bear ? 
  just reject us already so that we can stop wasting time . 
  good idea but i would be even happier if we started using `` devlet-i aliyye '' officially . 
  wow , this is just absurd . 
  why in the hell would they release an isis suspect ? 
  but which interpretation does that support ? 
  how can you tell it supports `` literal '' interpretation and not orthodox one ? 
  especially since `` literal '' interpretation is quite recent movement . 
  and from what i understand that part says quran being the book ( for muslims ) without any doubt . 
  ~ ~ you have to give more context to this verse as it does n't really support your assertion . ~ ~ this [ link ] ( http://islamawakened.com/quran/2/2/ ) shows that it does n't say anything like you meant . 
  merely it being `` without doubt guidance for muslims '' . 
  it does n't even need 5 mins of googling ... 
  how does that give any support for `` literal interpretation '' ? 
  it merely says quran is guidance for muslims . 
  as a native i suggest visiting in september . 
  sea is a lot better since it is warm and heat is just right for visiting historical places . 
  though , visiting aspendos for opera festival is also great . 
  turkey , but it is more like reverse nodding . 
  edit : interestingly we make normal nod for yes , so it must be even harder for foreigners to differentiate . 
  well , it is kind of complicated but gist of it is that we are all turks , we speak `` language of turks '' ( turkish ) but we are all talking in different dialects . 
  i do n't tell my dialect name when it is not needed but i actually speak `` istanbul turkish '' ( with antalya accent ) . 
  an azerbaijani is also a turk and speaks `` azerbaijani turkish '' as you can see there is no one that speaks just `` turkish '' . 
  there is no logical parent group and we are all subgroups . 
  we get to use it mostly because we rarely interact with other turks and we are the biggest group among turks . 
  nationalism fucks this up so it is a lot more complicated in reality . 
  well , sorry for not meeting your expectations , i guess ? 
  seriously , i do n't like any gender segregation because i do n't think it is useful and prone to very big problems . 
  but i do n't think it is something illogical . 
  men and women are not exactly same physically . 
  there seems to be enough physical differences that makes it justifiable for holding sports separately . 
  and men ca n't be pregnant as far as i know and this also changes things . 
  there is also the idea that changing status quo is not worth it unless there are clear advantages . 
  it seems a lot easier than defending religion or politicians and people do those all the time . 
  why not ? 
  please explain and i can play devil 's advocate on this . 
  i think i can defend that position quite well . 
  sadly i am busy right now but feel free to start and i will try to answer with a good argument . 
  you are moving the goalposts and trying to fill the blank with a stereotype . 
  all these things you said are different things with different level of support from both erdogan and turkish people in general . 
  we can talk about them as well but first i shall ask again ;  so , why would she ask her husband about this ? 
  both the article the op posted and the article you used did n't imply whether she should ask her husband ( or anyone else ) about her opinions . 
  you take you preconceptions and act as if they support it . 
  maybe they do but then you did n't give any source showing that . 
  and i explained that when muslims say they do n't support equality , they can also mean something else than what european people understand . 
  we are not you , we have a different culture and mentality . 
  and you have to take into account who said this , where they said it , and whom did they say this . 
  else you take it out of context and risk slandering people . 
  you take things you heard about muslims then fit them into a stereotype and act as if erdogans also support it . 
  how do you know it is `` actually oppression '' ? 
  i know people ( including women ) that support similar things and they are quite sincere about their thoughts . 
  you do n't have to support it but it is not `` sick '' and it has logical consistency . 
   also who is to decide which rights are proper for men and which rights are proper for women . 
  who is to judge this ? 
  * same ones that decided it before . 
  for turkey it is turkish people , not you or anyone else . 
  did europeans ask us when they were doing their laws ? 
  no they did it themselves according to their own culture and situation . 
  now they are trying to force their values unto us . 
  act as if we are monsters for being who we are . 
   as far as mr & misses erdogan ... it looks like an oxymoron one to say that not all `` roles '' are proper for women ( actually says stay home with the kids ) and the other one to call women to take more `` roles '' in society . 
  one of them is a hypocrite it seems . 
  i do n't see him asking to ban women from taking different roles . 
  where did you read this ? 
  not on the articles of op and you posted . 
  his own daughter and wife are very active on social projects , so he clearly does n't mean only `` stay home with the kids '' . 
  wanting different roles for men and women or putting what he called `` motherhood '' does n't necessarily mean women have to stay home . 
   so if i may ask you ... how can you not see that ? 
  i see many wrong things supported by erdogan but i do n't read into his `` intents '' because that is fallacy . 
  you can claim things are going become like that but then talk about those , not this or that individual . 
  many muslims see men and women as unequal but nuance here is they do n't mean that as men should have more rights . 
  they see both men and women as having different rights and duties . 
  as in equal amount of rights but not same rights . 
  they do n't ask for women being slaves , only different rights for both of them .

  if this gulen prick had succeeded , we would not have that . 
  and turkey has a strong secular , western-like ( i hate this expression but whatever ) , democratic and republican population . 
  thats why erdogan will never be successful about his full dictatorship dream . 
  he couldnt , he wont . 
  he only satisfy his disguasting ego , he makes a fortune , he makes his surrounding millionairs if not billionaires . 
  but thats all . 
  we are the guarantee of modern turkish republic . 
  he wont be able to ruin these ideas in our heart . 
  so if erdogan is -1000 , this gulen guy is -100000 . 
  thats why we are standing against him as a whole country . 
  i am an opposition supporter ( chp-leftist secular party ) , for like 30 years we were saying '' this gulen prick is so dangerous , he wants to demolish secular republic and establish a shithole like iran w ; th homeyni '' gulen is opposition to only the modern values and human rights of turkish republic . 
  noone is sacking opposition . 
  erdogan is suppressing us ? 
  yea he does because he is a prick . 
  does erdogan make us silent ? 
  yea he has plenty of media and paper and companies that doesnt let us express our thoughts much . 
  still turkey has a strong democratic background that how much erdogan rapes it , we still are represented . 
  we still have a voice . 
  and erdogan is elected democratically so it means he may be gone democratically too , and one day he will go and turkish republic will still survive . 
  but this gulen cunt is a total threat . 
  he is against democracy . 
  any kind of coup is against democracy . 
  and there is no way to get rid them off and set up the democracy again after them . 
  yea we hate erdogan , we hate his dictotorial shit , still he is an elected president . 
  he came with democracy and he will go with democracy . 
  gulen is only opposition to my beautiful , this way or that way secular , this way or that way free country . 
  gulen was never into politics but still did all of his things underground . 
  like a venom in your veins . 
  he worked for 40 years for his plans over turkey . 
  dont get me wrong , this situation is not enough for me , i want more freedom , i want more human rights , i want more voice , i want to live my life in a more free , more democratic and more rich turkey , and this will happen without erdogan , when erdogan is gone it will be better . 
  but as being a passionate supporter of the biggest opposition party of turkey , i dont fucking want that gulen prick . 
  he is poison . 
  edit : and do you know why gulen couldnt succeed the coup attempt ? 
  because when he started the flame he thought the kemalist secular soldiers will join to his attempt also because of our hatred towards erdogan . 
  but kemalist soldiers didnt support the coup . 
  they gave this gulen prick the middle finger . 
  because yea we hate erdogan but we love our country . 
  and little david is made resignated of pm , by erdogan after his fail over syria and russia politics and honeymoon with eu . 
  and there is already a whisper around that david is actually pro-gulenist and that is why he has been made resigned by erdogan . 
  so for russian payment , both orderer and doer of plane shoot-down is punished . 
  true , then geography does not mean much . 
  that is all i am saying . 
  there are lots of reasons to not take turkey to eu and there are a few reasons to take it in . 
  but geography is not any of them . 
  it is silly to consider geography as a reason to not let turkey into eu . 
  ( besides border with syria and iraq and isis and iran and andandand ) but you got my point . 
  if nowadays turkish soil was a part of the greece and only greeks were living in turkey soil , greece still would be an eu member . 
  so , geography is not important . 
  no , turkey is neither culturally nor ideologically part of europe . 
  everyone knows that . 
  i did n't already say anything against it . 
  all i do not get is , why would it be a problem for a country to be in asia ( especially so close to europe one ) as long as you have the values of europe ? 
  if it is a problem , why cyprus and malta are members ? 
  clear ? 
  beside all you counted are true , why would you care if turkey is mostly in asia geographically ? 
  it does n't mean anything . 
  cyprus is in asia geographically . 
  malta is in africa geographically . 
  israel is in asia totally but still more european than turkey and would be a eu member so easily i guess . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_migrant_crisis#migration i could n't understand your point unfortunately . 
  on the link above , you can see how many illegal immigrants europe had in 2014 and how many of them is turkish immigrants ( turkish passport holders , turkish citizens ) . 
  well you ca n't see because evenif we assume there is illegal immigration from turkey to europe it is less than 7000 people obviously . 
  and guess what , europe is about to visa-free albania soon , who gave almost 9000 illegal immigrants in 2014 . 
  well if you are talking about german turks , french turks , dutch turks etc , they are not illegal , they are rightful citizens of those countries . 
  they have been called by very itself of those countries to create a working force . 
  and if it is the case that turks will flow to europe after visa-free travel , well they would do it while all these poor syrians are doing , looks like it is not that hard to pass to greece from western anatolia . 
  and apperantly these starving turks did n't do it . 
  man , what you say is really weird . 
  not the part that germany has bad experience with turkish `` guest '' workers . 
  it is obvious that turkish germans are problematic and could n't managed well regard of assimilation . 
  that is not my point . 
  the point is when germany desperately needed to workforce , they called turkish workers . 
  noone said that they will be `` guests '' or anything . 
  they went there to make money . 
  while they do make money they established a life there , they had kids and friends and a new life . 
  after a worker works for 20 years for that country how can you say him that he is a guest and should go home now . 
  why ? 
  because i fixed my shit with your help and it is my country already so i dont need you anymore . 
  if that was case , than germany should not give them citizenship at the first place . 
  uae does that , i work there , and doesnt matter if i work there for 50 years or my kids born there neither me nor my kids will have uae citizenship and will leave country at a point . 
  germany didnt do that . 
  so it is not fair to call them `` guest '' workers . 
  they went there to be a part of german country . 
  if you ask my honest opinion ; germany should have never get turks as workforce . 
  idk why they did . 
  it was a wrong choise since europe is pretty racist and inviting that much muslim wont help to this old fashioned europe tradition . 
  german turks are not like turks neither germans . 
  they are like living in a limbo . 
  well , your country ( ies ) your rules . 
  i just wanted to make a point about why the current visa regime does n't make much sense or the scares . 
  those you want , tend to get in anyway of course by waiting on visa line and paying some more money ( when i said 100 dollar i guess euro zone people thinks that is 80 euro , not much money . . 
  it makes almost 300 liras in turkey , a quarter of minimum wage ) . 
  as i said , your countries your rules . 
  it is not that hard to get a shengen or british visa as you may think for a normal turkish citizen . 
  it is not like your embassies are rejecting majority that wants visa . 
  what they ask is your paycheck info for 3 months , and a little money on bank account to show that you can buy a ticket back to your country . 
  for example me , got polish shengen , was working in a construction company for 3 months as civil engineer , earn around 800 dollars . 
  had a saving in bank around 400 dollars . 
  bought my ticket and booked my hostel - which i canceleld later - and got the visa . 
  they had gave me before too .

  the point is that you can accurately describe a historical event with a current term . 
  so argument should be whether slaughter and sack of carthage by romans can be described as a genocide or not , instead of whether it 's correct to use term genocide to historical events before it became a term . 
  a descriptive term can not be `` anachronistic '' for being used retroactively . 
   well this is weird i personally remember some turkish scholars who denied any massacres happened fringe and irrelevant , official position is that armenians died but there was no intent of genocide and genocide as a term is newer than the events . 
  i am not defending that position by the way , i gave it as an example why it 's stupid to use that argument , you are not supposed to argue against it , if that was n't clear . 
  genocide is a term newer than armenian genocide . 
  turkish state often uses this argument , saying you can not call extermination of armenians a genocide because it was n't a legal term back then . 
  did you think armenian genocide denial was denial of exterminations ? 
  it 's not , it 's denial of genocidal intent and legal binding of term genocide . 
   let me guess , you 're one of those people that think columbus was an unconditionally evil , mass murdering genocidal maniac . 
  there are contemporary spaniards who thought as such and even after colombus . 
  among which there was charles v who was disgusted by the treatment of natives by the spaniards there and directly communicated with hernan cortes to tone it down and treat them as they would any subject of castile . 
  i think his point is that you can understand the social standard of history and thus judge it within context while also classifying it with modern terms . 
  to me it sounded exactly like what he was doing , he was trying to avoid selective judgement of historical groups from same time period , e.g vandals were terrible for sacking rome but romans were totally cool for sacking carthage . 
  it 's okay there are still those who remember carthage . 
  the city who was more prosperous and more populated than rome at the time of their rivalry . 
  it must be subtle in its luxuriousness , simple but well decorated and elegant . 
  that 's a lot of money just from jewellery . 
  trying to cheat taxes with death . 
  well istanbul has a population density of 2523 pop/km \u00b2 . 
  depends if you count it as europe or not , however . 
  it was mainly the spanish silver and gold that inflated ottoman treasure , suddenly there was a huge bubble and corrupt very quickly followed . 
  portuguese trade routes definitely did n't help but would n't be enough by itself if the impact was n't so sudden . 
  they did fine for almost a century after the portuguese were in india after all . 
  dutch were on friendly terms with ottomans , due necessity and they had no problem trading with them . 
  this viewpoint of ottoman and austria-hungarian collapse being `` inevitable '' due their multi-ethnic background is largely discredited by academia in recent times . 
  it 's mainly a post-ww1 assessment of why they were suddenly no more and is incredibly deterministic . 
  both of them were going through turbulent times and perhaps it could get worse but collapse was n't inevitable , in fact i 'd say very unlikely . 
  austria-hungary and ottomans were reforming and with no end in sight to the attempts . 
  akp and g\u00fclenists are both religious and use religion to further their goals . 
  we have `` siyah '' which means the colour black and `` kara '' which means dark . 
  zenci is from persian word meaning black . 
  some say that politically correct referral is siyahi but that 's so ridiculous because both of them mean black just from different roots . 
  i personally would n't refer to anyone by colour of their skin in interpersonal dialogue but if a general term `` zenci '' is pejorative so should be `` siyahi '' . 
  i feel like some english speakers directly translated `` zenci '' as `` negro '' thus decided it is offensive but i have never heard of it being used in a dehumanising way like `` negro '' has a history in americas . 
  of course if a black person would find it pejorative i would n't use it , it makes no difference for me and i am happy use the word they prefer , it just sounds a bit unnecessary adaptation of different standards to me . 
  well i suppose that 's a problem with western media itself . 
  because the region of middle-east has a long history which can portray a lot of different expressions . 
  currently however , i understand that you meant a backwards islamic country by your implication , i was n't challenging that , my question one was a rhetorical one meaning it could portray more . 
  what does it portray ? 
  they ca n't be hanged legally , even if capital punishment was to be passed today , they would have to change a law in constitution regarding criminal charges not being applicable to people who were prosecuted before the penalty was defined . 
  changing that law in constitution would also defeat one of the biggest arguments turkey has against armenian genocide , that is the events in ww1 took place before genocide was defined as a particular war crime by international community and can not be applied to situation of armenians . 
   just a comment . 
  middle east is a term coined after the armenian genocide . 
  no one knows how the world and labels would have been like had there been an important christian country in the region . 
  what ? 
  middle-east was coined before ww1 . 
   adil , a striking eight-year-old boy with dark skin and green eyes , had the second name `` zenci '' , a pejorative turkish word for `` black '' , roughly equivalent to `` negro '' . 
  i had no idea `` zenci '' is pejorative . 
  a bit ignorant perhaps , same as calling all europeans `` franks '' as ottomans formerly did , sure but pejorative ? 
  also there is a lot of ignorance bordering discrimination about africans as a whole , i have heard some ridiculous things said about africans , not with malice but with a unfounded confidence . 
  northern cyprus should be annexed by southern , no rotating presidency and only recognition of turkish speaking cypriots as a minority . 
  turkey should have never invaded or intervened with cyprus and it was only done as a point of populist politics by the politicians of the day to show that they still had power projection . 
  their location and navy is still of importance to nato . 
  they used to spend over 2 % during cold war era but i suppose currently they would n't be doubling their military spending , which is currently at 1 % . 
  sweden used to have a very prestigious military , especially air-force during cold war and could afford to stay neutral , nowadays they are n't what they used to be and a nato membership might be profitable to them . 
  you have a lot of faith in corporations . 
  i like the article , made me try to imagine my own in-group and out-group . 
  is gender your trigger word ? 
  even the caliphates such as abbasids and ottomans had their own laws separate from sharia . 
  sure , islam demands more interference with state than christianity but it did n't happen overnight with christianity either . 
  there were a lot of modernisation attempts in islamic world , primarily in egypt , tunisia and ottoman state . 
  that 's true but smoking increases the chances a lot that you 'll die of heart attack or cardiac arrest in your 50s . 
  most smokers die from heart attack or cardiac arrest . 
  sweden : `` i am became death , destroyer of germans . '', 
  it 's by development and other factors but it 's a central state . 
  there are some separatist sentiments in north but nothing as serious as catalan and it used to be just bunch of random kingdoms before napoleon took it and created the italian states . 
  why did it came to be spanish equals castilian ? 
  before spain was known as `` spain '' it was known as kingdoms of spain , it was always seen as a union between kingdoms . 
  i wonder if a similar thing would be happening in france today if not for louis xiv 's centralisation policies which were later solidified by the revolution . 
  i am not debating your opinion i am merely curious why the viewpoint is like this . 
   so why did n't end up like a more centralised country like france ? 
  probably because spaniards fought against joseph 's rule . 
  if french did n't alienate the spanish and joseph ruled in spain they would likely end up centralised like it happened in italy . 
  i do n't understand why catalans do n't consider themselves to be spanish , probably franco 's fault . 
   the collapse of the ottoman empire . 
  it was stagnant for 300 years , it is only a surprise that it did n't collapse with murad iv . 
   the renunciation of all non-turkish territory that was part of the ottoman empire and their cession to the allied administration . 
  so like any of the losing sides of ww1 , including germany and austria-hungary , yet you would n't make the same argument for them because you are operating on ideology not interest in history . 
   a `` secular republic '' to their image , easier to control by ... 
  they did n't want a secular republic , uk and france both wanted ottomans to stay as a dysfunctional caliphate because that 's easier to control , that 's literally what they signed in treaty of sevres . 
  the treaty of sevres was invalidated , so they did n't get what they want , which would be a turkish state in the vein of syria or iraq but even more divided . 
   imposing their banks to dictate the turkish economy as well as full access to its market . 
  what 's your argument here ? 
  what are you even arguing at this point aside that ottoman empire was weak in 19th century which is very well known , yet trying to suggest it should have stayed the way it is , for some reason . 
   before 1830 , there was a state religion in istanbul , islam and the ottoman empire had its way to administrate its territories , by terror and slavery mostly , it had its own way to govern and had its way to manage its economy and so on . 
  that 's forgetting the fact when ottoman empire was first found it worked on completely different principles . 
  it was n't until selim the grim that ottoman empire took its place as the caliphate and foremost power of islamic world . 
  in fact even after him suleiman tried to build an empire that worked in rule of law and meritocracy . 
  that 's why they did n't depend on sharia only but wrote their own laws . 
  not to mention greeks , armenians and jews often held high positions in bureaucracy and trade . 
  istanbul was more cosmopolitan and varied both in terms of culture and authority back in ottoman empire than it is now , which is largely homogeneous . 
  you also already started with an entirely false premise that ottoman empire was always static on how it ruled and whats its principles are , they changed a lot from war to war and sultan to sultan . 
  the suggestion that it should have stuck to old ways despite it not working anymore and why they became as vulnerable as they were even though once they were thought to be impossible to remove is also because they failed to adapt to changes and thought themselves better , a suggestion you are giving now , 300 years later after they already made that mistake and collapsed for it . 
  also ottomans did n't try to administrate with terror but balancing local governance with loyalty to state by appointing state loyal people to administration from governed areas . 
  the `` terror '' happened because they got corrupt and incapable . 
   one hundread years later all that was gone , the ottoman way or we could say the turkish way was gone , the european way took over most of it . 
  the `` ottoman way '' being what here , exactly ? 
  an outdated model of empire that belonged better to middle-ages ? 
  would you say the same about french state ?

  i dunno , ask me about the armenian genocide or something , that would annoy a turk more than the name , though i doubt you know about it . 
  without getting into oppression olympics i 'll say that armenia was the aggressor in this war and twice as many azeris were displaced . 
  so maybe azerbaijan is the one who needs protection here . 
  xaxa , was one big city until filthy westerners divided and conquered !, 
  except i 'm an atheist and trying to get away from those muslims you hate so much . 
  ~ ~ jesus ~ ~ i mean mohammad you are stupid !, 
  still attacking my country and not me , going for a low blow that failed to hit i see . 
  `` the only turkey ah know iz the one ah eat on thanksgivin ' i ai n't knowin no other turkey !, 
  fun fact : that bird was imported from ( to central europe ) turkey/turcia/t \u00fcrkiye / land of turks so the name stuck with brits . 
  most languages have other names for the bird , pretty funny ones too i might add . 
  this escalated rather quickly ... yeah , our military dick is n't as big as yours we ca n't kill more people than you what do we do ? 
  oh confused racist gun nut , i knew you had a power problem the moment i saw you trying to keep your weapons while trying to get away from those filthy coloureds as far as possible . 
  i 'd talk shit about good ol' murrica back , but i do n't want to get on a list y' know . 
  you know your toxic and painfully ironic opinions were shown to be absolutely wrong and utterly embarrassing and now you 'll attack me personally or my country , because you lack the knowledge to argue . 
  which i do n't give a shit either way because i think this country * went downhill * anyway . 
  ( but seriously , i 'm considering moving out like you but my reasons actually make sense so have at you ! ), 
  you went full / r/murica , or rather the people they are parodying . 
  just leave before you embarrass yourself even more . 
  and to top it off you are monolingual because you 'd never learn the filthy language that is spanish , or any other language because the only language ah need is american !, 
  i get what you are saying , but do you * really * think the us government could n't pay literally everyone in usa a livable wage ? 
  come on gun nut , inflate your country 's ability 's * now * !, 
  well good thing you do n't have to because the us is the wealthiest nation on the god damn planet . 
  seriously , when the us really wants to do something they do it . 
  you 're telling me your problems are caused by the shoeless poor fuck that manages to try to make a better life for himself/herself by risking her life ? 
  get a fuckin grip will you ( \u256f \u00b0 \u25a1 \u00b0 \uff09 \u256f \u253b \u2501 \u253b nah that was way over the top dramatization , but you get the idea . 
  god bless america . 
   we have a huge welfare state  ** we have a huge welfare state ** hahahahahahahahha welfare state said the american !, 
  welfare state too huge said the american !, 
  here 's a ridiculous proposition : stop spending so much in your military . 
  you are aware that you are in / r/europe and even underdeveloped countries laugh at the us for the lack of exactly this ? 
   your statements reek of ignorant stereotypes i commonly see from europeans that know little about certain regions here . 
  sure , you bear no ignorant stereotypes and you are the source of common sense , common sense flings out of you as if you are a common sense fountain . 
  also calling a turk a european might rustle some jimmies around here , careful . 
  i see americans still have a long way of solving race issues ... you really think immigrants are the problem and not horribly inefficient management and corruption ? 
  you sound like the guy who tried to create his own all white town and defend it with guns . 
  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; well um , you should immediately go to russia then , you 'd fit right in . 
  guns ( or really any weapon ) , xenophobia , nationalism , racism , what 's not to like ? 
  trying hardest at what ? 
  going downhill ? 
  nah , chill and eat some burgers you 're all going to be just fine . 
  mate , you have n't seen `` going downhill '' have you ? 
  ah well , keeping your standards high in these kind of things is good . 
  i think russia/albania/serbia etc might be excellent countries for gun lovers but they are probably worse than the us in everything else . 
  but really , us is fine . 
  you have some stupid politicians but those guys are pretty harmless weasels . 
  it already is . 
  oops , i should have added `` in times of war '' * so yes , if there 's mass hysteria or any kind of military related job something close to that is going to happen . 
  although it can be argued this is the case regardless with drafts . 
  guys , it 's both . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  you assume that you will not force your beliefs on other people , but patriotism requires you to submit your body and your mind to the ruling authority , what you think of `` my country '' is definitely different than what i think which is probably why we ca n't agree on loving this piece of fenced off land . 
  why do you fixate on your country ? 
  why not your religion/ideology/race ; _ ; / location/class/etc etc. . . 
  i 'm genuinely asking why you like to hang on your national identity instead of anything else . 
  what is it about countries that makes you want to quite literally give yourself to the ruling authority ? 
  if you are already going to criticize your country ( which i do n't buy , patriotism by definition means you have a bias towards your own country ) then what use is it ? 
   if it did , it would almost certainly be to stop the spread of boko haram , rather than to go to war with the government this straight up does n't make sense . 
  that does n't threaten the canadian mainland and if you are thinking about an american style post 9/11 hysteria , that 's so improbable it 's best to ignore it . 
  you might say `` but you actually think canada would declare war on nigeria ? '', 
  i gave that as an example , think of the us or russia if you will . 
  by the way if you did n't know , when you are in the military no one gives a shit what you think , you are a literal tool for the high ups to use . 
  so your `` stop x i disagree with !, 
  thing is a myth . 
  simply put , dangerous and simplistic way of thinking . 
  is joke comrade , and it 's `` ruble '' . 
  thing is , it 's very hard to draw the line at where nationalism/patriotism stops ( the same damn thing ) . 
  let 's say if canada declared war on nigeria would you join the war and go to that country ? 
  ( usa vs afghanistan/iraq/vietnam is a nice example ) and if yes for what reason ? 
  to spread how nicer your country is ? 
  probably not . 
  but most people seem to support western countries unconditionally and that 's dangerous . 
  i 've seen comments like `` ah well , war is hell . 
  hope we can rehabilitate these guys ! '', 
  on abu ghraib photos while if that were to be reversed ( hell , i 've seen people calling for the death of iraqis who lynched a blackwater mercenary after they opened fire on civilians and left or some such ) it would have been let 's get those towelheads !, 
   not much of what you have says make any sense wat, 
  the reason for those coups were proxy wars between the us and the soviets , the secular thing is a mask for that . 
  oh i know akp will , there are local elections though & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  uniting muslims kind of sounds like a pretty religious government to me mate , make up your mind . 
   yeah , i know erdogan has $ 1 billion of stolen cash in his house , but i do n't give a fuck . 
  there are no good alternatives to the akp . 
  you are a part of the problem ... 
  i disagree with this , i am an atheist and your thinking that `` turkey is a success '' is the result of an engineered middle class . 
  you might say `` but it was worse !, 
  '' , people are taking insane debts to buy what they want and that might crumble and we 'll be worse than greece . 
  [ source , there are much more if you want to research . 
  ] ( http://www.albawaba.com/business/erdogan-turkey-economy-564476 ) erdo\u011fan is very corrupt and if you still support him i do n't know what to say . 
  besides , i 'm probably taking the bait here but you say you are secular yet talk about uniting muslims ?? 
  i do n't care what you say , you just make yourself look like an idiot . 
  your attitude is the problem , not your opinion . 
  this comment seems familiar ... 
  well , he did get out of a very bloody war that ended a literally 600 years old world empire , saw his friends and people die , all the while getting tag teamed by great powers . 
  he kind of had to get things in line . 
  erdo\u011fan is basically `` oops how do i close thing '', 
  seems like a troll . 
  i get what you mean and here 's the thing ; ** it does n't matter . 
  ** but it seems to matter to a lot of people , which is n't nice . 
   ethnicity is a social construct , not a concrete biological reality . 
  i agree with this but many people do n't and that 's sad . 
  however , `` biological realities '' do n't make any kind of classification ok which was what i was talking about earlier . 
   edit : also `` thank you for your service '' is a wonderful thing to say to civil servants/military professionals .

  occupation is unlawful but turkey had a right to intervene . 
  edit : people who downvote me please go read the events that lead up to turkey 's invasion . 
  turks did n't wake up one day and went `` oh it 's a good day to invade cyprus '' as people here seem to think . 
  imo cyprus should be reunited but there probably will be ethnic conflicts if that happens , even people here see turks as colonists who have no right to be there . 
  even russia ca n't help it . 
  no need to make `` we thought brexit and trump was impossible too '' no you thought it was impossible . 
  le pen has a * much * lower chance of happening . 
  turkey elected a kurdish leader once . 
  it can happen again . 
  after erdo\u011fan is dead possibly lol . 
  it 's not the majority of turks but yeah even 49 % is too high even when you add the orwellian government propaganda we have , arrest + firing + oppression of people who campaign against akp and election fraud . 
  akp has like 30 % base support who will never change their votes , they are like football team supporters , they 'll vote for akp no matter what . 
  their brains are so washed it 's a wonder that they do n't go catatonic . 
  the shit they believe in is like a fantasy world . 
  occasionally i watch akit ( government propaganda channel ) it 's like watching a fictional world . 
  they got % 40 but they did the elections again , in the same year . 
  if akp loses an election they 'll just redo it again until they get more votes lol . 
  chp actually won ankara in the earlier local elections but akp took it anyway . 
  until election fraud problem is fixed in turkey , do n't have much expectations from turkish election results . 
  nowadays they are arresting people who are campaigning for the referendum . 
  some people are fired from their jobs because they declared they 'll be voting no . 
  i 'm sure fraud will happen also . 
  in an environment like this i find it funny that people here treat turkey like an democratic country . 
  it 's a democratic country when it 's time to hate turks , it 's an authoritarian country when it 's time to hate turkey . 
  oh whatever i hate my own countrymen too lol . 
  but yeah 49 % voting for akp is too high considering the shit they do , even with government propaganda , oppression against the opposition , election fraud , shitty election laws like 10 % election threshold , etc. 
  so i ca n't argue with that either way . 
  nowadays they are calling the referendum opposition terrorists, 
  lol m8 shitty edgelords are butthurt ikr, 
  of course he is . 
  all turks are 100 % pure altaic blood none of that disgusting outsider blood has entered our gene . 
  my dick simply refuses to enter foreigner vaginas . 
  that would make them go crazy lol . 
  the clusterfuck is real though . 
  we should marry off erdo\u011fan 's son and daughter to either armenian , kurdish or greek rulers for non-aggression pacts . 
  better take care of % 100 decadence first though . 
  call it by its ' proper name , yo\u011furt . 
  there are more than two parties in turkey you know . 
  every turk has a different opinion about this . 
  not even turks agree on it . 
  we are a mix of europe and middle east . 
  middle easterners complain that we are ultra-secularist westerner-wannabes , europeans see us as muslims . 
  i do n't think we 'll ever be part of one . 
  and we do n't have anything to do with central asia anymore . 
  btw you should take a look at [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sultanate_of_women ) if you are interested about this stuff . 
  this is a topic neo-ottomanists in turkey wo n't admit to lol . 
  let 's hope he did n't do anything funny to the pizza . 
  lol almost everyone there is like `` now you understand how we have been treated like for years ! '', 
  as a turk that was my thought too while i was reading that whinepost . 
  maybe we should try being nicer to each other and not being judgemental at the sight of flairs . 
  because everyone feels vilified . 
  it 's really annoying when someone blames me for something my country did or is doing . 
  the op seemed like a guy with an agenda . 
  you can pick these guys apart easily from the way they talk . 
  they are usually more subtle than this though . 
  one thread of misinformation and you are pissed off ? 
  try being a turk on / r/europe . 
  misinformation is common in reddit , just ignore and move on . 
  yeah it sucks but it happens all the time to everyone . 
  you get called a fascist . 
  i get called genocidal . 
  or not worthy of living in \u0130stanbul . 
  or some other bullshit . 
  ( though mods are quick to handle such comments ) . 
   ` ottamans loved gay sex ' [ no kidding ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-masbk0depbw/vxkbsrejw3i/aaaaaaaafou/7iebjg87c5chji0m_ha6ckrjvugxkh_ngclcb/s1600/oglanlarin-grup%2bseksi.jpg ), 
  / r/isturkeysafe /, 
  strangely tame this time . 
  i was expecting at least one `` it 's safe except that we behead foreigners for fun so watch yourself '' that one is always a classic . 
  to be honest it 's not as good as it used to be . 
  statistically you still literally have a higher chance of dying in traffic or something , but i dunno . 
  if i tell you to go for it and then you experience something like that , i 'd feel like shit . 
  you do n't even have to try when it comes to pkk and kurds . 
  it 's so simple to trigger them by using this topic it 's basically cheating . 
  it 's true , but the government 's standing is more complex than that . 
  it would make half the population think better of you and other half want to throw you off a cliff . 
  if that 's happening in europe , it 's filled with erdo\u011fan 's fanatics so you are more likely to run into an akp idiot there . 
  i prefer to call \u0130stanbul by its ' true name , miklagard , anyone who calls it by any other name are edgy shitlords who are trying to get other people triggered . 
  `` soccer '' i can not think of a derpier name than that . 
  it 's football . 
  futbol . 
  turks call it futbol too . 
  actually the d\u00f6ner i ate in germany was much better than the d\u00f6ner i 'm eating in turkey . 
  they just have this awesome sauce man . 
  and they do n't cheap out on the amount of meat they put . 
  meat is expensive in turkey . 
  i call this `` europeans misunderstand us !! 1 ! '', 
  annoyance we have * the midnight express effect . 
  *  most of them are wrong or really stupid . 
  that 's why it 's annoying lol . 
   it 's annoying to see a bunch of stupid posts at the bottom of every thread . 
  better than seeing them on top . 
  and by nature stupid posts are supposed to be at the bottom . 
  if they are at top then it 's time to leave that sub . 
  yeah it annoys the crap outta me too but you know if someone does n't make a comment like that , the thread just feels missing lol . 
  ask him why he does n't wear fez like normal turks do . 
  desert does n't mean lack of forests lol . 
  ooh boy if that keeps up we 'll be living in a city full of gray concrete . 
  we might as well fill the bosporus with concrete . 
  it 's the guys running this country are allergic to green spaces . 
  food debates annoy everyone in the balkans lol .

  i tried to enlist eastern powers but they did n't want suicide with me . 
  ( imho this is literally ~ ~ nation ruining ~ ~ * fucking up another player 's game . 
  it is also very rude . ), 
  at this point i did n't really have much choice . 
  i could just give up and choose another nation but , meh , that 's pathetic . 
  so i did what i only could , i tried to make it as hard for my enemies as possible . 
  in the last game i was qara and timurid rebels fucked up my army very badly during the game . 
  so i wanted to do something like that . 
  i also did n't want to give them lands they want . 
  after few trials in sp , i realized scutage prevent your vassals from being annexed in a war . 
  thats why i released bulgaria . 
  so that hungary and poland would n't be able to gain anything . 
  i wanted to release epirus and give it balkans to prevent ere but i realized the force limit penalty for having vassals too late . 
  i also planned to fuck up my nation and generate rebels when war started . 
  but it seems ottomans are too stable for that shit . 
  the reason i attacked the knights was to finish one of them before the coalition started . 
  in the first startup which failed , the knights actually had allies so i could n't attack him . 
  but after restart , it seems they forgot to ally the knights . 
  his only ally was byzantium and i wondered if the byzantium player might join the war by mistake . 
  it would have been great so i tried it . 
  then the game crashed and the knights player did n't join . 
  since i did n't really need the land , i just white peaced . 
  but after learning , the player joined in the next break . 
  fucking knights , they were always sneaky ... 
  if i had enough time to test it before the game , i am sure i could do it . 
  if we have priority for veterans in the next game , i will do it 10 times better . 
  imho given smart strategy , ottomans can actually take so many enemies with them . 
  it might not win , but it can turn it into pyrrhic victory . 
  ( if lithuanian , bohemian and byzantium armies were to be destroyed . 
  it would be a good lesson . ), 
  i also made mistakes . 
  for example , i expected them to move quickly against me but they actually waited until the truce ended . 
  i could have taken advantage of this and declared war first . 
  stability hit is actually exactly what you want when you need to generate rebels . 
  i could have devastated byzantium and quickly moved to one of the others and make sure their army is destroyed . 
  it could also fuck up their coordination . 
  just like how it happened when one of them fucked up and attacked against me across straits . 
  edit : by the way it was actually fun . 
  like playing zombie survival in eu4 : / edit2 : * did n't realize `` nation ruining '' was a specific term . 
  [ this is ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jtljl_bdos ) the one right ? 
  have n't seen it before it seems quite interesting . 
  a look at istanbul from the other side .

  a while ago , i discovered an amazing documentary called [ balkan sesleri ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plhiebjpguailmbgezkxf2y-kmzn2ds6we ) ( sounds of balkans ) . 
  it is about sufi music of balkans . 
  it is like an insider look at sufi orders . 
  especially ones in bosnia and kosovo . 
  it 's in mostly in turkish but since it 's about music , it does n't matter that much . 
  they even made 2 albums from those songs . 
  ( [ 1st ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plhiebjpguaikuqcz_obx23vzknqmlxsir ) & [ 2nd ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plhiebjpguailaqihzkghntpg6nrt81rpa ) ) they are pretty good on their own but watching it being performed is something else . 
   he 's a senior advisor lol , no . 
  he is a bootlicker . 
  every few months he says something outrageous like this and everyone goes crazy . 
  this is how he earns his place . 
  by being an attention whore . 
  once upon a time he was a critic of erdo\u011fan but did an u turn in like a day . 
  since then , everytime he opens his mouth , reaction is `` wtf ?! '', 
  no idea why but akp has dozens of these people . 
  all of them are crazy . 
  i think they are there to create alternate reality by making everyone else seem rational . 
   as long as erdogan does n't publicly rebuke him he never does . 
  only time he even come close to such a thing was just before referendum when mhp leader threatened to pull his support ( indirectly ) . 
  even then , he only said something like `` listen to the things i say , not anyone elses ''  secular turks in so much fucking denial it 's hilarious . 
  maybe you 'll tell us that the kemalist faction will storm to power in the next election ? 
  ... why passive aggressive ? 
  oh , come on . 
  yeah , he is an adviser to erdo\u011fan along with few dozen other bootlickers but that 's the extent of his importance . 
  this is the same guy who thinks people are trying to kill erdo\u011fan with telekinesis . 
  this is already embarrassing enough . 
  do n't give him even more spotlight . 
  dude , i literally wrote mere 2 comments . 
  what stubbornness ? 
  whether it is a weak claim or not is not my problem . 
  any country would pursue them if the advantage gained was worth it . 
  cool . 
  except we are not claiming anything over the frontiers or islands where our sovereignty is recognized . 
  we simply say that this treaty recognized our sovereignty on those islands by not giving them to either italians or greeks . 
  otherwise what is the point of listing all those islands and giving them to one or the other . 
  for example , i remember not seeing these islands being mentioned : koyun ( inusa ) antipsara hur\u015fit ( fymena ) fornoz ( furni ) anyway , regardless of the how strong it is , this is the claim and we continue pursuing them . 
  edit : i hope the translations were right . 
  edit2 : yes , i saw the 15th article and we recognize your sovereignty over those islands . 
  not really , that part affirms turkish sovereignty inside 3 miles . 
  thats all . 
  \u0130\u015fbu antla\u015fmada ayk\u0131r\u0131 bir h\u00fck\u00fcm bulunmad\u0131k\u00e7a , asya k\u0131y\u0131s\u0131ndan \u00fc\u00e7 milden az uzakl\u0131kta bulunan adalar , t\u00fcrk egemenli\u011fi alt\u0131nda kalacakt\u0131r . '' it specifies some islands and says that except for the ones under italians and unless there is any , all islands under 3 miles will be left under turkish sovereignty unless specified otherwise . 
  it certainly does n't mean turkey losing islands across 3 miles . 
  it does n't say greece getting all islands after 3 miles . 
  not all islands are named in that agreement . 
   nagorno-karabakh made peaceful democratic steps towards independence before it was attacked by azerbaijan , and defended itself . 
  then there was a ceasefire agreed by both sides . 
  it was and is part of azerbaijan . 
  they do n't have right to decide by themselves . 
   i will take random turkish nationalist internet warriors seriously i fail to see why my nationality is important . 
  yes , i am turkish but what i said has nothing to do with it  if they apply the same principles to north cyprus , kosovo , bosnia , croatia , slovenia etc. 
  i apply the same principles for everyone .

looks like it 's straight out of mirror 's edge . 
  no one in turkey actually cares about joining eu besides akp , get over it . 
  i 'm actually not familiar with that . 
  i 'll look into it . 
  bill gates amounts of money , since i 'd have to pay every single person within a few kilometers not to lynch me . 
  ** edit : ** by the way to be clear , i idolize ataturk myself . 
  he truly was a badass motherfucker that understood what it meant to be a leader and just * how things worked * . 
  well , we did give it a cool name . 
  kebab is cool . 
  also there are very , very different kinds of kebabs . 
  the one you 're thinking of is sis kebab . 
  not only did you talk about the armenian genocide in public but you actually talked about ataturk in the same conversation ? 
  wow , you guys were actually lucky to have got away without too much trouble . 
  anyway , i do n't think ataturk had * anything * to do with that . 
  actually , he could n't , he was a medium/high ranking military officer that i believe did n't have enough pull to affect those kind of decisions . 
  while the over idolization of ataturk among turkish people is sort of unhealthy , he was undeniably one of the most effective , charismatic and progressive leaders the world has ever seen . 
  and i 'm not saying that because i 'm turkish . 
  edit : changed to be clearer . 
  i agree that there is n't aggression between the two sides in cyprus right now . 
  but with trnc 's lack of international recognition , turkey ca n't really perform a total withdrawal . 
  well , with the current state of international recognition ( or lack thereof ) trnc has i do n't think it would be as simple as that . 
  though it is a good point . 
  i kind of regret that i stepped down to his level , i apologize for the name calling and the pointless insulting . 
  i do have an actual informative post in that pile of posts though . 
  i 'll copy and paste that here in hopes of a more civil discussion . 
  `` let me chime in here , since most people obviously have no clue why the northern cyprus issue exists in the first place . 
  according to london and zurich agreements ( 1959 ) , cyprus was to be a partnership of turkish and greek cypriot communities . 
  the eventual turkish intervention was because of the violation of these agreements by greek cypriots attempting to unite the island with greece and deny the turkish cypriots political equality . 
  there was 11 years of bloodshed committed by the greek cypriots on the island , and over a hundred turkish cypriot villages burnt and destroyed . 
  even nicos sampson , then leader of cyprus said in an interview from greek newspaper eleftherotipia , `` had turkey not intervened i not only would have declared enosis ( unification with greece ) but i would have annihilated the turks in cyprus . '' '', 
  most people ( and by that i mean almost every other turk i know ) deny the armenian genocide because , `` well , they killed a lot of turks too , and it was during a war . '', 
  both of those statements are true mind you , but that does n't make it fair to kill ( even if indirectly by forcefully migrating them ) a whole bunch of people . 
  it 's a big taboo in turkey . 
  i 'd , if i 'm lucky , get some very mean looks and bad words if i said armenian genocide was n't bullshit in public , in case of bad luck , there would be some fists swinging around . 
  not to say this is people 's fault , for they 're taught as such in history lessons in school . 
  ** edit : ** for why the country as a whole denies it , i do n't know . 
  i mean ottoman empire did it , not turkey . 
  we do n't have something to lose , it 'd only give some closure to the relatives of the victims . 
  though i 'd also like armenians to actually admit having killed quite a lot of turks at that time too . 
  you were n't talking about today , and if you were , it made no sense . 
  there is no `` protecting a minority with violence '' going on . 
  i honestly do n't know what you mean by that if you 're talking about today . 
  how is an actual quote propaganda ? 
  also you assume that anyone but some of the akp crowd gives two shits about joining your already faltering eu . 
  i 'll just stop replying to your comments which are obviously trollish in nature . 
  have fun deluding yourself . 
  yep , showing your obvious ignorance about this topic you try so hard to argue about . 
  you very obviously have no idea why the intervention even occurred in the first place , you may want to read up on it . 
  you can actually start by reading my comment explaining it in this thread . 
  we do n't want `` you '' to do anything , and chp has a lot of support * because * of the rightful intervention of cyprus . 
  i do n't even know why i keep responding to you . 
  i usually do n't feed obvious trolls . 
  let me chime in here , since most people obviously have no clue why the northern cyprus issue exists in the first place . 
  according to london and zurich agreements ( 1959 ) , cyprus was to be a partnership of turkish and greek cypriot communities . 
  the eventual turkish intervention was because of the violation of these agreements by greek cypriots attempting to unite the island with greece and deny the turkish cypriots political equality .

  even nicos sampson , then leader of cyprus said in an interview from greek newspaper eleftherotipia , `` had turkey not intervened i not only would have declared enosis ( unification with greece ) but i would have annihilated the turks in cyprus . '', 
  so i 'd urge you to rethink the statements you 've made in your comment . 
  ** edit : ** i 'd also like to present my opinion about this issue : i 'm not only against withdrawal from northern cyprus , i 'd not vote or support any politician or political party supporting that idea . 
  ** edit 2 : ** getting downvoted for posting the truth and an actual quote ? 
  why , good job guys . 
  i 'd never guess people as ignorant as you could manage getting on the internet let alone post a semi-coherent comment . 
  well , damn me . 
  says some random dude from gibraltar of all places . 
  sure matey . 
  to `` you '' europeans ? 
  this guy ... 
  yea , that 's never going to happen . 
  considering majority of his people in and near turkey resort to terrorism in order to `` defend their rights '' , i 'm not terribly sorry about his `` abuse '' . 
  other countries mentioned are not the recipient of monthly , if not more often , terrorist attacks . 
  there is no question that pkk is a terrorist organization , and their support amongst almost all kurds in turkey leaves much to be desired when it comes to peace negotiations . 
  at the moment with everything going on in western turkey ( mostly ) ; my friends in eastern turkey fear for their lives , as the police there have been moved west and some people ( namely kurds ) have started publicly supporting pkk . 
  i 'm not happy to label people as terrorists based on their race , but that is what they rally behind themselves . 
  obviously not all turkish kurds are terrorists or terrorist supporters , but they really are in the minority .

  just to spread the info , duolingo is preparing an irish course and it 's 85 % done . 
   famous ? 
  less known ? 
  he is a completely unknown figure to most turks . 
   do u mean he wont win ? 
  imo he does n't stand a chance against the akp . 
  some kemalist members of the main opposition party have already started to question his candidacy . 
  he is conservative but more moderate than erdogan and he is n't famous at all .

  you forgot the part where we will force christians to eat kebab on christmas . 
  you clueless liberals !, 
   that 's called `` getting people not to integrate themselves '' around here . 
  learning german as the first language is the number one thing germans demand from immigrants so that they can integrate themselves . 
  to directly oppose that demand is directly opposing turkish integration in german society . 
  i read the quotes , i dont ' agree with all of them but i still think this is not exactly calling people not to integrate themselves into german society but anyways , thanks for the links and the translation !, 
  no , unfortunately i do n't . 
  can you copy-paste the part where he said `` should n't try to ** integrate ** themselves into german society . '' ? 
  i 'm not saying you are lying but i just do n't see that part in deutsche welle 's website .

  http://www.dw.de/asimilasyona-hay%c4%b1r/a-17660423 according to deutsche welle 's turkish website , erdogan said that the turks should keep their religion , language and culture alive but they also should learn german language very well and integrate into german society without assimilating .

  we call them `` simit '' in turkey . 
  here is the wiki article for you : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simit, 
  this reminds me our traditional simit-sellers in turkey . 
  please do n't get me wrong , i 'm not blaming you for what your country did some 100 years ago but it was the british empire that left arabian peninsula to the wahhabis . 
  that 's a fact . 
  reading the article i made a connection between the headline and the part where it says `` crimea was , is , and will be ukrainian soil '' but on a second thought , i think you are right . 
  he basically states that he will not recognize the invasion but there is no mention of retaking crimea . 
  they do n't `` enter '' anywhere . 
  isis is the biggest player in extremism since they stole all their fanbase from the aq . 
  they are simply ex-aq sympathizers who got more excited with the idea of a state . 
  of course the presence of isis is worrying not only in europe but anywhere else in the world . 
  they are as worrying as the golden dawn supporters who go around and stab people to death , or armed neo-nazis who blow up pipe-bombs at turkish markets and gun down turkish immigrants . 
  all those radicals are a minority in their own communities but yeah , they are still worrying and that 's why the authorities must monitor their activities closely . 
  thank you for not standing behind your false claims anymore . 
  this is reddit , you know . 
  we do n't have to turn everything into a dick waving contest . 
  oh come on . 
  why do you guys always do this ? 
  you had a claim and i asked for a source . 
  now you are just playing with the words and not providing any source . 
  yeah , they called him a frenchman because he is a french citizen but they also stated that he allegedly had ties with some islamists in syria and his motivation was anti-semitism . 
  source ? 
  also , that depends on your definition of `` extremist '' . 
  if a muslim goes overseas and kills civilians , everyone would call him an extremist but when a non-muslim goes overseas and kills civilians , everyone calls him a veteran . 
  if anyone is looking for a proof that the number of extremists in the european muslim community is incredibly low , here go you , you have got one . 
  they organize a protest in one of the biggest cities of belgium and how many supporters they have got ? 
  approx . 
  however this does n't mean we should ignore them . 
  the european authorities must keep an eye on those idiots and promote other muslim organizations which fight their extremist ideas . 
  there are hundreds of mosques all around europe and they organize `` open door days '' for non-muslims , they invite non-muslims to their `` iftar dinners '' in ramadan , they focus especially on young people , so that they do n't get involved with `` gangsta '' or extremist groups etc. 
  they are the most effective `` tool '' the european have got against the extremists . 
  you see . 
  you have exactly the same mentality as the people you 're complaining about . 
   it may surprise you but radical islamic political groups are usually classified on the far right ~ ~ here . ~ ~ ** everywhere . 
  ** ftfy, 
   many people seem to defend massive muslim immigration to europe from mena . 
  nobody supports `` massive muslim immigration '' . 
  just because someone opposed your idea of shooting at refugees does n't mean they support massive muslim immigration . 
  wow . 
  i spent my entire education life in the mediterranean sea region and religion classes were always seen as `` easy credit source '' where almost everyone got full points ( 5 ) and teacher never got deep in the religion . 
  you are welcome . 
  most alevis consider themselves muslims but there is a tiny alevi minority who claims that alevism does n't belong to islam and is a separate religion . 
  addition : turkish religious education focuses on sunni islam and that is one of the main reasons why some alevis dislike it . 
  ** turkey ** yes . 
  1 hour per week . 
  it was super easy . 
  we had to memorize few very short parts from the quran , learn basic islamic rules such as how to clean ourselves before praying and how to pray . 
  i remember we also had information about other religions in our book but i do n't remember ever studying them in the classroom . 
  you do n't have to attend those classes if our parents write an official letter to the school administration but probably 99.99 % of students attend them . 
  i remember reading news about an alevi family who excluded their kids from those classes . 
  number 2 , because turkey is not ready to give up northern cyprus ( for the record , i am all for a united cyprus ) number 3 , because our population is just too big for the eu . 
  number 4 , because turkish people lost their interest in the eu . 
  as i 've said couple times here on / r/europe , the turks do not talk about the eu anymore , our accession process to the eu is considered a joke among turkish people . 
  if armenia really joins the eurasian union , we can stop talking about the potential membership of turkey and azerbaijan because that would never happen . 
  putin and his partners would choose azerbaijan and turkey over armenia . 
  joining the glorious and stronk eurasian union !, 
  well , the annexation of the northern cyprus was just a joke but the turks are very aware of the reality that we will never be a member of the eu and the third biggest party ( the nationalist mhp ) still consider the central asian countries as `` our turkish brothers '' , so i believe that the decision of joining the eurasian union would face very little criticism in turkey . 
  i also would like to hear other turkish redditors ' ideas . 
  do you guys think anyone , except the chp ( the second biggest party ) , would oppose this decision ? 
  since the dear leader erdo\u011fan has gone completely insane after the betrayal of g\u00fclen 's cemaat ( their biggest ally ) i expect him to annex northern cyprus and join this union instead of the eu .

  i 've noticed that since most kurdish political activists in europe are communist , europeans tend to think that the kurds are more or less a politically homogenous group but that 's far from reality . 
  there are some kurds sympathetic to armenians but that really depends because the kurds are extremely polarized by their religious and ideological backgrounds and have fought each other in most parts of the historical region of kurdistan . 
  e.g kurdish hizbullah vs the pkk in 90 's turkey and talabani vs. barzani in 90 's iraq .

  this makes no sense . 
  the other day i posted a bit of news ( a video ) about a man in istanbul crying allahu akbar and trying to burn down a church . 
  it got delisted by a moderator who writes everything in french and english , saying that it 's random local news . 
  i said that in that case charlie hebdo was random local news too . 
  i guess charlie hebdo was random local news too, 
  some of the background chatter : the woman in the beginning : `` is it in your religion to burn the house of the lord ? 
  that is the house of the lord . '', 
  `` these people have gotten out of control . '', 
  `` where are the cops ? '', 
  `` put it ( fire ) out , call the cops '', 
  i have no qualms with the statistics they have provided . 
  when the results are out not even they will be able to keep the truth curtained - but i 'm just surprised to see them there . 
  like i said , they are like the pravda of akp and / r/europe does n't sound like it 's very fond of our islamists . 
  by the way , thank you for the megathread . 
  it 's really well done . 
  why is the link at the very top yeni safak ? 
  they are basically a government newspaper right now . 
  if it was the 80 's would you take pravda at their word ? 
  i hope the same . 
  their spokesperson today acknowledged that votes which carried them over the 10 % threshold were `` lent '' to them , and they said that they will try their hardest to keep those votes . 
  both sides have erdogan as a common enemy , i think it will help creating some rapport between the kurds and the turks . 
  i disagree . 
  akp 's greatest strength has always been their illusion of invincibility - that illusion is dispelled today . 
  to be honest , turkish people who did n't like erdogan were always a huge majority - but i 'm just so insanely happy to see us deliver that killing blow to akp . 
  mate , i stopped being civil when they soaked the streets with the blood of the innocent . 
  but for the thread 's sake i 'll keep it to myself :p, 
  this might be our last election . 
  wish us luck . 
  ever hear of this bloke named snowden ?

  hahahaha, 
  for the time being , it 's not going anywhere . 
  it 's going to crash and burn after the elections , though . 
  mark my words . 
  if the opposition wins , they are going to win sound economists to handle the monetary business . 
  the opposition is not going to win . 
  under erdo\u011fan the future of turkey will become increasingly more volatile and a `` bad investment '' . 
  if you are still missing the elephant in the room , i 'll make it easier to you . 
  we are sending the fucking guns to the people doing the beheading , not their victims . 
  / r/turkey is a nationalistic circlejerk where `` no true scotsman '' is the king . 
  if this colossal clusterfuck was n't by erdo\u011fan , and say , caused by some figure whom mainstream secularists hold dear , the post would be crucified in a matter of minutes . 
  you 'd know that , seeing how you 're a moderator there . 
  erdo\u011fan is fair game but armenian genocide is not . 
  so i 'm going to pass up on that , out of principle . 
  he 's got people saying that his lackey 's prime ministership was gifted by divine will . 
  probably not 1979 levels , but definitely morsi levels of fuckery is afoot . 
  i was referring to 1979 of iran - not the 1979 of turkey . 
  it has always been that bad . 
  turkey 's economic boom was all about foreign investment - which were due to a liberal fa\u00e7ade . 
  now the masks are off , and the money is gone . 
  turkey has used * none * of that money for production tools either , so long term economy is a bust . 
  shit will hit the fan for the people who want to live like free human beings . 
  the lucky ones will leave the country somehow , the unluckies will try to swim in shit , hoping they do n't get too much in their mouths , living lives of quiet desperation . 
  a la 1979 all over again . 
  sorry , do you call ammunition humanitarian aid ? 
  if they were sending the turkmens proper aid they 'd be broadcasting it live 24/7 to get those suhweeet right wing votes . 
  if those trucks were meant for aid the mortar rounds would n't be hidden under drugs . 
  it 's obvious where the trucks were headed and you know it . 
  also , state secrets ? 
  taxpayer money is spent on funneling arms to isis or anf or whateverthefuck and the public does n't get to know about it ? 
  fuck state secrets .

  not necessarily , but it persecuted the ones who did n't convert after its expansion .

  thats what ypg is trying to achieve in syria . 
  that 's very much true for pro-government newspapers but the opposition is n't too bad i think . 
  hurriyet for example is better than most european media channels . 
  i have no clue but as far as i know she graduated from a turkish college . 
  i ca n't remember when it was or who she was argueing with but a complete whore from central anatolia was argueing with that romanian girl with lots of spelling errors ( actually anatolian accent ) so she said i did n't even know a single turkish word when i first came to this country while you were born and raised here and still ca n't spell it or something like that . 
  at this moment my nationalist mom started to support that romanian girl even tho she was n't actually turk but culturally more turkish than the other ones . 
   she did n't said it when they were arguing ? 
  she said it but in another episode :d . you made me realize i actually watched this thing , fml . 
  i have n't watched it back then but i think those two girls who make fun of the brown girl were hitting on a guy but the guy rejected them and said he is interested with that brown girl . 
  he is some sort of macho/though guy but he told that girl ` i 'm like lion to everyone but a cat against you ' which is a fucking retarded thing to say ( no getting lost in translation it is stupid in turkish aswell ) so those two made fun of her with that quote and probably jelaous aswell so they started to make fun of everything about her . 
  including the way she dresses so they dressed like her to mockery . 
   and what they said until she ( edit : the blonde girl ) said she did n't knew a single word . . etc ? 
  i 'm pretty sure she moved to turkey few years ago , not during the reality show . 
   we have kanald ( in romanian ) here too and two shows like the one you put here . 
  i 'd apologize on behalf of turkey to spread this shit but i think they like it . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oejundouc_g the blonde girl ( romanian ) said she did n't even know a single turkish word when she first came to the country and yes she does speak better than half of the others in the room . 
  disclaimer : do n't watch it for more than 5 minutes . 
  it is insanely stupid and addictive . 
  he claims that christians are n't equal to muslims but he does n't mention what rights do christians lack in turkey . 
   the halki seminary for greek orthodox theological education was closed in 1971 - and despite certain promises , it has n't been reopened . 
  because they refused to join the ministry of national education . 
  turkish state controls any schools even if they are religious schools . 
  this is not a discrimination and a good way to control the religion . 
  i mean you do n't ever see a turkish imam calls to murder atheists or infidels or other hundreds of fucked up shit coming from islam because they are simply not allowed to talk ( even if its in the quran itself ) about the topics other than the speech given by government . 
  you ca n't tell that people are muslim or christian when you see them in the church . 
  muslims do n't pray differently in churches . 
  the namaz is a different rituel and you do n't do namaz ( or w/e its called in english ) in a church . 
  turkey is by far the best ally kurdistan regional government ever had . 
  they are nearly a puppet state for turkey because of the huge investments by turkish companies and stuff . 
  they even embargoed rojova to not harm the relations with turkey . 
  ypg is syrian branch of pkk . 
  they are brother/sister organization under the kck umbrella . 
  nevertheless ypg leader was invited to the turkey and promised to get aided in syria if they part ways with pkk . 
  idk around 200-300k or something . 
  majority of them are living in the western part of the country with secular neighborhoods so most of them does n't even practice at all even tho there are hundreds of active churches . 
  in fact i 'm pretty sure there are more muslims in churches than christians in turkey . 
  eh , you ca n't expect turkish fm to say thanks germany for recognizing armenian genocide . 
  he is like ` let me look like i defend turkish interest but we 're cool as long as you do n't put me in this kind of situations again ' . 
   one of them talk better than me in both our local languages its the same case with romanians in turkey and note that every other eastern european who was n't born in turkey always use r agresively . 
  i mean they sound like rrren geyigi , instead of ren geyigi ( reindeer ) . 
  i just heard this guy speaking on the radio ( acutally news break ) when i was driving back home . 
  he said it depends on the attitude or behavior ( ca n't remember the exact word ) of germany . 
  i 'm like 100 percent sure he did n't request german parliament to change the desicion . 
  i thought my point was clear that as ` allies ' we should n't support the terror groups which carry terror attack on innocent civilians . 
  i 'm not supporting isis but you are supporting pkk . 
  would you like it if the turks here supported isis ? 
  i hope this time you understand since this is the most clear way i can explain in a foreign language . 
  right because we were best alllies with ypg . 
  armed groups carry terror attacks from syrian soil . 
  i thought ` we ' were allies . 
  your comment is equal to me saying after coalition strikes on isis ; ` why does europe have the right to intervene in syria and start killing our allies ? ', 
  it is n't that important . 
  russia does n't even build that much naval power to match turkey on the black sea . 
  majority of their fleet is in other regions . 
  i 'd say they do n't want to lose turkish market or even the country itself after they already put sanctions on russia . 
  that news confirmed to be fake along with attacking alevi neighborhoods . 
  i thought we were talking about turkey . 
  if we are looking for past the worst crimes of humanity belongs the nations that live in the european continent . 
  i 'm pretty sure u can find articles about how wasp are mistreated in the usa aswell . 
  this is just plain bullshit . 
  christians live a priviliged life in western part of the country . 
  source : my ass . 
  such as ? 
   nothing would happen . 
   how many terrorist attacks have been carried out by christians in turkey though ? 
  i ca n't even imagine the reaction if this happened in turkey to a christian person . 
  i think he does n't want to deal with elitist scumfuck bastards to have a nice weekend in the northern cyprus since we still need visa for eu countries . 
  he could pull a putin or something tho . 
  put a complete clown to the main opposition and control it and then say see we have a democracy . 
  that 's good but i hope the northern forests do n't get raped . 
  we are bitching about it for the last 2-3 years . 
  in fact erdogan even told usa , you are either with pkk or turkey . 
  not sure why this post gets downvoted . 
  the modern equipments are n't in the south eastern part because there is simply no armed group or country to be able to invade turkey there ( blow the highways and there will be simply no way for tanks to go through the mountains ) . 
  the opposition always did but you do n't hear anything from us in the western media . 
  he probably thinks turkey is like russia where lgbt propoganda is illegal . 
  whatever , it 's all global conspiracy to hold turkey back . 
  1v1 us irl . 
  apachi selim sends his regards . 
  do n't be ridicilious % 4000 is enough . 
  gib back . 
   so ... whom would replace erdogan ? 
  or you can learn how to punch someone in the face . 
  i would n't be surpised , since the government taxes the shit out everything . 
  they take arround 200k $ tax from a 100k $ priced car so you pay 300k $ in total . 
  istanbul is the only western city akp invests on actually . 
  rest of the western cities are chp majority . 
  meanwhile there are only 41 electric cars on the list out of 300.000 in the biggest turkish online shopping platform . 
   from my experience it is sooo much worse among turks and arabs . 
  could you please provide your experiences in detail ? 
  i 've some openly lgbt friends and people ( including devout muslims ) are too afraid to offend them . 
  if a random person dies , the chances of the news channels reporting it is like 5-10 percent but if a lgbt person gets murdered/raped eveyrone lose their shit about how turkey is the worst country for lgbt community and stuff . 
  now i do understand that why the publicsphare is presenting this news like that . . to get more awareness , that 's cool and understandable but it kind of pisses me off when some random person from a different country comes up with the same shit . 
  it creates awareness for the inside but ruins the image for the outside . 
  and yes , i do study pr btw . 
   i do now know what news is seen as false from a turkish point of view . 
  eh , pretty much all of them including this sexual abuse laws . 
  yeah tell him or her . . suck on that sweden !, 
  denying the capital punishment also prooves that turkey does n't want to break relations with the eu . 
  from an outsiders perspective , yes .

  kurds are very good at pr so they continued the pr they built in syria . 
  they successfully posed themselves as the most important opposition to erdo . 
  main opposition was too too late for pr stuff so at least % 25 of people remained in shadow and isolated . 
  that 's why i 'm glad that opposition started to play the game but they are too late for this . 
  anyway , better late than never . 
  k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu finally realised how to get attention of foreign media . 
  only if he started to do this years before . . 
  without us , pkk seperatists became `` the opposition '' in the eyes of western media . 
  also the article is perfect , i 'm glad our voices are heard now . 
   aksener poses a unique threat to erdogan because her brand of politics draws from a similar pool of pro-business , religious , and nationalist voters as the president . 
  she is unapologetically conservative , and has been called the turkish answer to french far-right leader marine le pen . 
  she is hawkish toward kurdish separatists . 
  she says she would allow turkey 's three million syrian refugees to remain in the country , but she has unspecified `` concerns '' about their presence . 
  still , she insists she can attract support from across the political spectrum , including kurds , noting her frequent campaign visits to the kurdish-majority southeast . 
  she also rejects any comparison between her style of politics and the racism of the european far right . 
  `` we do n't do politics based on race or ethnicity , '' she says . 
  `` our definition of the nation is based on shared memories , share ties , and shared joys . 
  that paragraph is problematic . 
  first of all le pen and ak\u015fener can not be compared . 
  le pen was a reaction to neo-liberal policies ( namely immigration and so on ) in france . 
  ak\u015fener is a reaction to erdo 's unbearable dictatorship and islamisation policy . 
  those two are different . 
  the rise of far-right in europe is reaction to neo-liberal & progressive movements and politics . 
  we have never witnessed neither neo-liberalism nor progressive movement for 15 consecutive years . 
  in fact we 're living in far-right hellhole for 5 years . 
  second , the author considers all kurds ( 18 million people ) have the same ideology and same goal , they do n't have . 
  they are really divided into ideologies which radical islamism and seperatism are the most common . 
  in western turkish urban cities like istanbul , ankara , \u0130zmir etc you have kurds supporting lots of ideologies . 
  by the way , it looks like the author tried to connect fighting pkk with being far-right . 
  she 's a nationalist , for sure she is hawkish on pkk . 
  rar-right : fucking muslims unzip our archives . 
  look at [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/koftibey/status/884188473292357632 ) flood then . 
  i do n't bother to explain . 
  political change can not happen overnight , political change is like avalanche . 
  rallies like this contribute this raw to become bigger and bigger . 
   all people outside hear about is only the secularism vs islamism struggle and little more . 
  progressivism would fit better . 
  secularism vs islamism struggle is new whereas progressivism vs conservativism or reactionary is 200 years old struggle . 
   but who in your view are the progressives of turkey ? 
  i consider someone or some group who want and try our nation to be adapted into 21st century 's norms and values `` progressive '' , and i consider someone or some group who rejects 21st century 's norms and values and idolise islamic values or turkish values from 2000 years ago `` conservative '' . 
  the area is 270.000 msq ( 140.000 msq general rally area with 130.000 msq entertainment area added ) the rest depends on how many people were there per metresquare . 
  police calculated it with 6 per msq , we calculated it with 8 . 
  hmmm ... we have n't achieved such progress . 
  during that period , turkey was ( and still is ) dealing with ideological struggles between conservatives and progressives so we could n't moved much for years . 
  that does n't mean it will continue forever . 
  eh well you should look at turkish history from tanzimat era to 2002 . 
  i can not summarise it . . 
  it was turkish anti-erdo\u011fan rally basically . 
  for article : [ here ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/09/world/europe/turkey-march-for-justice-istanbul.html?action=click&amp;contentcollection=world&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentplacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront ), 
  first , look at [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/xfysb ) . 
  now tell me , which name could fit better than `` justice '' when even mp 's of opposition parties are in jail ? 
  [ source ] ( https://turkeypurge.com ), 
  i 'm afraid you can not get it because all state institutions are politicised . 
  istanbul governorate announced that there were [ 175.000 people ] ( https://twitter.com/tc_istanbul/status/884176032554778624 ) in the area . 
  yes , they wrote this thing on ipad then took ss of it . 
  one may not believe organisators ' claims but one must not believe state 's claims . 
  you are right . 
  plus , russia and europe has never had good relations to begin with . 
  both were always rival/enemy to each other . 
  also when you add baltic & poland pressure to eu against russia , there 's no reason not to be openly against russia . 
  but turkey is different . 
  since tanzimat era , ottoman & turkey turned its face to europe , relations improved , culture integrated etc. 
  15 years of islamist rule can not destroy 200 years of westernisation . 
  idk ; since nobody trusts government statements and there was a consensus on near/at least 2 million people ( including kati piri 's tweet which is very important ) in the area , i wrote at least 2 million . 
  then ft got it wrong because that area is as large as 171 football field . 
  basic thinking : 171x100x50 = 855.000 kmsq . 
  if you add 2.5 people per kilometresquare , the number is 2.137.500 . 
  that 's why i said at least 2 million . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( http://www.sabah.com.tr/yasam/2013/04/21/maltepede-171-futbol-sahasi-kadar-miting-alani ) pro-government website said the rally area is equal to 171 football fields . 
   how come i can find no article about this ? 
  it 's not my fault if you can not use google  and from which ass did you pull out 2 million ? 
  simple . 
  there were lots of reports and tweets from mp 's that there are 2 + million people in the area , then police informed chp mps ' that [ there are 1.6 million people in the area ] ( https://twitter.com/tgmcelebi/status/884070699073253376 ) , then i saw kati piri 's [ tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/katipiri/status/884062076662157317 ) . 
  after all that , i said `` at least '' 2 million because there were people outside the area tried to entry when this photo taken . 
  okay ? 
   and wheres the comments in this post ? 
  ohhh , baby 's first reddit experience . 
   and why do you only post sub-news about turkey ? 
  because i live in this country and i 'm interested in this country . 
  okay ? 
   the `` justice march '' was praised by kati piri , the rapporteur for turkey at the european parliament , who described as `` historic '' the july 9 rally `` attended by nearly 2 million people who stand up for justice . '' [ source ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/july-9-marks-a-new-step-a-rebirth-main-opposition-leader-kilicdaroglu-says-at-justice-rally.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=115302&amp;newscatid=339 ), 
  eh ; considering some aktrolls on twitter claim there were 80.000 people in the rally , i 'd not be surprised . 
  even the police said 1.6 million people attended . 
  even the police . 
  imagine how many people attended . 
  too optimistic . 
  they would rather non-erdo-worshippers as the reason for sanctions and economic failure than drop erdo . 
  tbh it 's useless to talk about them since they are in minority and akp steal votes to get % 51 as we witnessed in referendum , local elections and so on . 
  i think people are not used to hear or see something about anti-erdo\u011fan folk . 
  i doubt most of people even think such folk exists ... 
  so when they see a photo like that , their reaction would be pessimistic ( like saying `` good , but that wo n't change anything . 
  erdo will be dictator for life '' etc. ), 
  because the perception about our country which created by both media and the government made foreign people to feel so . 
  seriously it 's just a 1 ( one ) person being dumb , not worth to have a debate on . 
  also we have lots of dumb people who squeeze orange to protest netherlands so i do n't think we 're in position to judge other people . 
  well it seems orban descended to the level of erdo so quick . 
   ataturk expelled most of the christian population in turkey to syria ( excluding the population exchange with greece ) . 
  i do n't know anything about turkish history : the post,

   multiculturalism is a naive and dangerous concept !, 
  when you say this , you 're kind of being a racist bigot . 
  maybe you 've heard it so much you just ignore it now instead of looking into why you might be called that and prevent it by either realizing your position or start using political lingo . 
  maybe it 's because americans see physical differences more than ethno-cultural ones . 
  i mean sure , some euros do n't like non-white people as well but still , i remember an american soldier going `` why are these white people killing each other ? '', 
  during the bosnian genocide . 
  next time do n't make such condescending and confident statements if you do n't know much . 
  the point is , this armenian thing is n't the only bad thing we 've done but many people seem to cite this as the sole thing we are responsible for . 
  we got rid of any failed rebels and successful rebels got rid of us , da uhrmenian jenosid seems to be especially stressed for some odd reason , it 's not just you . 
  most likely because armenians take every chance to mention it unlike greeks who most likely are not obsessed with something that happened a century ago because they 've got something else going for them . 
  why not subsidize that then ? 
  cheap and subsidisation for living in the middle of nowhere ? 
  oh alright they are completely ok then . 
  nope , it got way more heat after the french revolution . 
  you only mention the armenian `` genocide '' because it has the most pr going for it . 
  we got rid of all ( failed ) revolting peoples ( otherwise they got rid of us ) but why only armenians ? 
  because it 's the highest death count ? 
  by the way , are you armenian ? 
  who are you ?

   race is a classification system used to categorize humans into large and distinct populations or groups by anatomical , cultural , ethnic , genetic , geographical , historical , linguistic , religious , and/or social affiliation it 's meaning has changed significantly over time and it will continue to change . 
  race has no exact standard definition by the way , race can be literally anything you desire .

  that was completely uncalled for . 
   when they invaded anatolia , the turks did n't really change the genetic makeup of it , and just changed the language and culture of the area . 
  they 're mostly ethnically identical to greeks ( but do n't tell them that ) . 
  this is indeed true , i investigated my family history and found out that my father 's mother 's family were y\u00f6r\u00fcks from khorasan , they were turkmens who crossed the caspian sea a few centuries ago ( thus mixing with the persians ) and my mother 's father was most likely a tatar or circassian . 
  the rest were natives of anatolia . 
  they had to go a really long way to reach anatolia and unless they brought more central asians , their genetic makeup would inevitably change significantly . 
  most people are still the original population way back from the hittites though . 
  race has literally no standardised definition , feel free to use it for anything . 
  you 've been disagreed with , see you in hell filthy heathen .

  referandum.he is trying to create an enemy to gain votes . 
   occupying foreign soil can hardly be called protecting your country . 
  the balkans did n't belong to the ottomans anymore than india belonged to the british . 
  balkan armies came close to istanbul and it was a defensive war to protect where many ottoman civilians lived . 
   who says its their country ? 
  ask any armenian about his country . 
  misak-\u0131 milli ( national oath ) which was accepted by turkish parliment as the borders ( excludingnfee areas all of those areas were under ottoman rule before the empire collapsed ) . 
   that 's part of every war . 
  and?does that make it good ? 
   they killed as many as they could , liked or find necessary . 
  hitler also did n't kill `` every single jew '' . 
  yea they supported them as in many cases they worked with them as paramilitary troops . 
  it does n't have to be all muslims , a few are enough to make the christians distrustful . 
  what?hitler literally killed or forced every jew to leave and the number of jews in europe is nothing compared to pre-1933 numbers . 
  ottomans tried to assimilate christans and a huge part of the country was christian during their peak.they gave converts many opportunities to make christians muslim faster.if they really murdered every single christian there would have been far less christians in balkans and ottomans would have collapsed sooner . 
   it 's not most of them , it 's around 50-50 . 
  them being natives makes no difference , if anything a traitor is worse than an invader . 
  again the same `` traitor '' logic.jews , armenians and caucasian muslims were also `` traitors '' in the eyes of some people.i know this was what those people thought but they were blinded by nationalism and idea of revenge . 
   not `` every single german '' fought for the german army . 
  still it makes no difference , they inevitably all payed the price . 
  well , actually not all since there are 800k turks in the balkans still . 
  as i said i know these things happen but the main part is they are bad . 
   apparently those who drove them out did n't think so . 
  i also do n't think it is particularly doable . 
  it 's important to note that many of them left on their own by following the defeated ottoman army not wanting to live under christian rule . 
  it was doable but considering the fact that most of those revolts were nationalist based it was very hard . 
  many of them left because of fear not because they wanted to leave their homes . 
   any ethnic conflict is the direct result of the ottoman conquest and colonization . 
  as such any blame lies with the turks . 
  ethnic cleansing is actually quite normal in cases of demographic imbalances following an invasion . 
  the byzantines for example when they found out the goths could not be assimilated and had taken important positions within the military , simply slaughtered them and drove their remains into central anatolia . 
  i know this things happen during wars but this is wrong.i think we should be able to accept it and move on . 
   assuming that the christians would prove to be so merciful and forgiving which i highly doubt , this is not realistic in the long run . 
  a country like bulgaria with 1.5 million turks living as slaves would ultimately be lead to civil chaos and probably an turkish invasion to `` save '' the muslims ala cyprus . 
  the more realistic answer would be similar to hatay ( where a huge part of the population was arab ) . arabs assimilated or interigated into the society.despite beign near syria and most arabs beign alewite ( which plays a very important role in syrian state ) they see themselves as turkish and prefer turkey over syria and it is far from perfect.similar things could have been done in balkans . 
   i understand them , what i support is irrelevant when they 're gon na happen anyway . 
  i also understand them too but we should point out the bad things about these things . 
  in europe maybe but in the world it is jordan or lebnon ( for per capita and for the number it is turkey ) . 
  because rojova ( which is officaly democratic federal system of northern syria ) says `` we are syrian and we will stay as part of syria '' ( also a huge part of their population is n't kurdish ) . 
  edit : typo, 
   are turkish people really this blind ? 
  no most are n't that is why most people do n't support him but he controlls a huge part of media and shit like this ( campaign in europe thing ) gives him a boost in his campaign.you can get votes by creating and using a foreign threat ( like refugees for european right wing ) but the most important thing is erdo\u011fan is a huge populist.he changes his stances and manages to hide it from his voters thanks to his media support . 
   why should n't they be allowed to conceal their casualty ratio ? 
  because it is disrespectful and will create more problems in the future.hiding your casualties is basically lying to your own people and preventing them from getting information they need to know . 
   and how do we know media is not misleading us ? 
  this is a good point.we are n't sure so let 's just do n't blame russia for now . 
   so where did those 300k muslims , that fought in the first balkan war under the turkish banner and who were willing to murder their neighbours for the sultan to rule over them , come from ? 
  where did the muslims that fought the greek army and armenian army in anatolia come from ? 
  who did the muslim civilians of istanbul who massacred the greek population in 1821 come from ? 
  let 's be honest here shall we ? 
  from all over the country ( and not only muslims ) also they did n't wanted to kill their neighbors for sultans rule but tried to protect their country like nearly in every single war . 
  the army that fought against greeks and armenians in anatolia were mostly local people.they were grouped into an army and fought against the people to take back their country but this does n't make massacres against greek and armenian civilians right ( similar to what happened to muslims in balkan wars ) . 
  another important part is revenge mentality is a bad thing.in this case you are n't saying `` well we know those things happened but the reason was this '' but you are basically saying `` they were enemies so they killed them '' . 
   but were more than happy to let other muslims do their killing for them which makes them no different . 
  do you really think ottomans killed every single christians they saw and all muslims in the area supported ? 
   they supported the ottomans who had enslaved the christians and stolen their lands which again makes them no different . 
  considering the fact that most of them were local people it is different . 
   that 's not true . 
  they overwhelming majority supported the ottomans , not the bulgarian , greek or serb revolunaries . 
  the allegiance of turkish speaking muslims in the balkans and europe is first and foremost towards a foreign country , turkey . 
  one can also point to the cypriot case . 
  the muslims did n't and do n't want to live under greece and greek rule ( enosis ) even though a self rule or taksim could only exist through ethnic cleansing . 
  they preferred an ethnic cleansing of their neighbours than what the perceived as foreign rule . 
  first of all `` they did n't really care about those stuff '' is n't they never gave a f.ck but you are acting like every single one of them were soldiers who fought to their last blood.those people were locals.giving them a chance to stay and interigating them to society would have been a lot more benefitial for those countries . 
   how would democracy in let 's say bulgaria would have functioned when a significant part of the population would be more likely to serve hostile turkish rather than bulgarian interests ? 
  part of the population would have been turkish or muslim but there would have been a way for them to stay in the country.the logic you are using is the logic generaly used by people who support ethnic cleansing.it is n't about it beign benefitial ( it was benefitial for bulgaria and balkans in the short term ) but it beign wrong.defending the massacres against people while acting like they were foreigners is n't a good thing to do . 
   let 's get over with this then : muslims who supported the interests of their christian neighbours should not have been harmed under any condition ottomans mostly forced christians to pay taxes and many times governers were local muslims.similar thing could have been done instead of killing and forcing people to leave . 
   those whose supported hostile interests should naturally be left at the mercy of the victors as is the case with any fifth column anywhere else . 
  on the other hand the murder of innocents , either as retribution to a previous offence or simply as war crimes , is to be expected in any war no matter the moraliy of the act itself . 
  the morality is important because the words you use make it look like you support those things . 
   i was referring to the christian retaliation after the failed invasion of the ottomans in vienna . 
  acts like these exist in every war , it 's not `` muslim persecution '' anymore than the countless ottoman invasions are `` christian persecution '' . 
  thanks i was asking about it.considering the fact that most ex-ottoman christians call it christian persecution than it is ok the other way . 
  i agree with some of your points but do n't agree with your mentality . 
  sorry i did n't see your message until now ( that is why it took me so long to reply )  justify what ? 
  both groups killed each other according to what they wanted . 
  the muslims wanted the balkans occupied by the sultan 's troops and the continuation of the 5 hundred ottoman rule and the rebellious christian did n't . 
  it 's obvious that a change of the status quo would not have come without innocents getting killed so in the end it depends on how moral you view the ottoman rule vs the cause of the christians . 
  you are overly simplifying it.a lot of muslims did n't care about political rule that much and did n't kill anyone ( like a lot of christians ) . you are acting like every single muslim murdered christians and took their lands and fought for ottomans until their last blood while most of them were local people who converted to islam and did n't really care about those stuff.most of them would have stayed in their lands if they were n't forced out or did n't face persecution.it is n't about ottoman or christian rule but how civilians were treated saying `` it is not presecution if you invade someone 's lands and they kick your ass '' ( which is what you said ) is wrong.you are demonizing those people and justifying the bad things that happened to them . 
   what do you mean by `` this is the second time sharing this '' ? 
  a guy who had a similar name to yours also shared that link in a similar conversation a mounth ago and i replied to him.i thought you were that guy so my bad sorry :( ( this is actually why i deleted that part ) . 
   in your comment you referred to some of the massacres ( and a genocide ) but did n't mention the one i linked to which is somewhat relevant to what the parent comment was addressing and your reply . 
  the things i wrote were only about adana massacre which is the massacre in the link you shared . 
  - this happened a day after the 31 march incident started ( which happened during 12,13-27april 1909 . radical islamist in the army rebelled with the help of sultan.ottoman army marched to capital and crushed the rebellioun , brought back order and replaced the sultan ) while country was in chaos . 
  - people who were resposible were punished after the 31 march incident was dealt with ( even nationalist like halid edip ad\u0131var denonced and apologised for it as soon it happened ) . 
   yeaaaa i am not sure about that . 
  the young turks while being liberalish where behind brutal massacres of christian populations ( not to mention the armenian genocide ) . 
  young turks was a coalition that had many groups.their goal was to overthrow sultan and they did it.they also established a parliment.massacres you are talking about were done under three pasha rule ( which were also the part of the young turks movement but they took control after the 1913 coup ) . 
   i am pretty sure non-turkish locals remembers them as murderers . 
  non-turkish people also got into the parliment after 1908 revolution and i explained the difference between the groups in the first part of the reply . 
   i believe there was an effort during the late stages of the empire to create a commonwealth in the same way the anglosaxons did with their empire . 
  it would give more freedoms to bulgarians , greeks etc. 
  but turkish nationalism was starting to be a thing and some years later the nationalists formed their government in ankara . 
  the rest is history there were movement like that which gave more freedom to all ethnic people in the country .1908 revolution was about it ( it gave a lot of rights to other ethnic groups and tried to create an ottoman identity ) and it started it in balkans with huge support from local people.it worked very good for few years but empire was falling and defeats in wars really slowed it down and the 1913 coup ruined it ( 3 pashas took control with that coup ) . 
  so do you think this justifys it ? 
   it 's not persecution if you invade someone 's lands and they kick your ass . 
  ( are you only talking about the great turkish war part ? ), 
  most of those people ( espc in balkans ) were local people who converted to islam.calling this kicking someones ass is wrong.civilians were murdered and kicked out of their homes . 
   why are all muslims regarded as turks in this map ?

  i agreed with your post until this part .

  how do you even teach biology without evolution ? 
  i do n't care if you refuse the evolution theory you just ca n't remove it from biology class . 
  turkish people 's understanding of evolution is already not above `` humans came from monkeys '' anyway . 
  let it be taught people who do n't want to believe can continue doing that . 
  the other change is unimportant because nobody even cares about the religion class . 
  in high school we just studied math and shit while our teacher answered questions about religion from students it was essentially free-study class and back in elementary school all we did was memorizing some verses from quran . 
  highly doubt anything will change because kids do n't give a fuck about religion while they have classes like math and physics . 
  i am confused if problem is the immigrants spy on immigrants not your own citizens ... 
  i did n't know suspicion was enough to act in france . 
  i guess libert\u00e9 , \u00e9galit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 is just for show . 
  razing mosques without sufficient proof of this brainwashing is a good and fast way to make your muslim population hate you and sympathize more with extremists . 
  lol nationality checks out . 
  to be fair the teacher who made kids do that was fired . 
  lol we are lucky if we do n't get death penalty until she grows up . 
  not really seems very accurate . 
  half of the country loves akp goverment the rest hate it . 
  i swear in this sub i get the impression that you guys want us in the eu because my god i never seen anyone this obsessed with whether turkey will enter the eu or not outside of r/europe . 
  it does n't matter what the article about if turkey is in it the comment section will be filled with discussions about whether turkey will be eu member or not . 
  the talks have been frozen . 
  let it go !, 
  i do not understand what 's so hard to get . 
  turkey is not attempting to join eu for last 10 years . 
  erdogan is just acting like he does so he can use the reactions from eu to fuel his anti-western agenda . 
  turkey will be officially stop being a democracy . 
  not that we 're that democratic currently but it was in reversible state . 
  if the bill passes it 'll take a quite a long time to reverse the damage it 's gon na cause . 
  because this bill will remove the separation of powers from the constitution and give it all to presidency and good luck electing a president who will be like ataturk and give up his power for the better of the nation later on . 
  then you do n't agree with him dum-dum . 
  his main argument was this was a phenomenon that comes with being an empire . 
  not gon na lie i seriously did not expect you to be this illiterate and ignorant before commenting . 
  you could have answered my questions instead of typing those middle-school level insults but i guess you ca n't when you have no answer . 
  his argument was not `` ottoman empire enslaved and destroyed cultures hence why balkans have intense ethnic conflict '' . 
  did you ditch the english class or something ? 
  or maybe you did n't even read his comment . 
  then again i do n't expect someone like you who do n't even know some basic history to read anything . 
  lol and here i expected some logical argument . 
  my mistake for taking you seriously . 
  thank you for not wasting my time and telling if fair and square that you are ignorant and was talking out of your ass . 
  if anybody lost his identity under ottoman empire you should be able to give at least an single example if you ca n't then you have no case . 
  then pray tell which balkan culture is gone and which people lost their identity under ottoman empire ? 
  like do you not see the contradiction of your own argument ? 
  if ottoman empire did any of that balkan wars would n't even have happened . 
  since when people without identity start nationalist wars ? 
  well that makes sense thank you for explanation . 
  then elaborate instead of making useless comments like this . 
  yet you ca n't even explain it . 
  china is not kind to minorities though and india is extremely divided and racism is quite common from what i read . 
  lol ? 
  how the hell ottoman empire has anything to do with ethnic conflict in balkans ? 
  did i really do that ? 
  i explained why they will never beat akp . 
  in a european country they would be great parties . 
  chp would at least ... hdp and mhp sucks . 
  well i would n't say our opposition is bad they are just too passive because they think they are in norway or something . 
  current chp leader made the party too liberal and progressive for turkey that it only appeals to '' [ white turks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_turks_and_black_turks ) '' now . 
  hence no hope of ever winning . 
  this is some next level butthurt holy shit . 
  are you insane ? 
  empowering the majority and removing privileged status from a minority is n't genocide . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  what privilege ? 
  turks were hunted down village by village and put in to mass graves thousands of turks had to ran away from their homes to keep their lives if that 's not genocide attempt i do n't know what it is . 
  ever heard of bloody christmas ? 
  even children [ [ nsfw ] ( http://img.webme.com/pic/g/gizliilimler/sayfa_24_1.gif ) ] were not spared . 
  now i said this i bet someone gon na do the king of whataboutism and mention armenian genocide . 
  anyway here 's some basic links . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bloody_christmas_ ( 1963 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maratha,_santalaris_and_aloda_massacre  there is no justification you can make for violations of the geneva conventions and treating greek cypriots how israel treats palestinians . 
  then why are you justifying actions of greek cypriots ? 
  last time i checked massacring villages and burning down people 's homes and mosques were violations of geneva conventions . 
   it absolutely has to do with it , and your comment is a perfect example of why . 
  turkey and turks often seem to feel as if they 've some sort of god-given entitlement to everything that greeks have . 
  yeah sure whatever you say do n't try to hide your ignorance with random generalizations . 
  cyprus , turkey and uk signed the treaty of guarantee which forbid any of those 3 nations attempting to annex cyprus and cyprus from forming political or economic union . 
  greece and greek cypriots broke this agreement and gave us right to invade . 
  in other words you reap what you sow . 
  acting victim wo n't change the facts . 
  you like to mention your family 's sad past but you refuse the acknowledge the fate of turkish cypriots . 
  do a bit empathy ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_guarantee_ ( 1960 ), 
  none of these would have happened if greek cypriots did n't try to genocide turkish minority in the island . 
  they are the ones who gave turkey the right to invade by both harming the minorities and breaking the treaty of guarantee . 
  by the way cyprus invasion has no relevance to whatever you 're talking about with those 600 years long abuse . 
  i swear do you guys have mental age of a 2 year old ? 
  like i understand ignorance is paramount in r/europe but come on even parrots do n't say the same stupid thing this much . 
  please explain how erdogan the guy who did everything that eu is against wants to join the eu ? 
  he obviously does n't get that in to your thick skull . 
  turkey . 
  not . 
  serious . 
  about . 
  joining . 
  for . 
  the . 
  last . 
  years .

  good luck in your mission though . 
  gtfo racist, 
  can you point me to one post of a turkish redditor that claims that all kurds are pkk ? 
  and yes all pkk members are terrorists , i think we can agree on that . 
  the turkish sub is largely filled with secularists and nationalists . 
  wtf , dont listen to this guy . 
  he 's on a mission . 
   maybe if turkey started caring about the armenian genocide nvm , lets keep it the way it is . 
  there are a lot of turks from abroad in the sub with no so good turkish skills . 
  it was discussed a few times before but it was agreed that the sub would be bilingual . 
  oh , i dont speak for the government . 
  they should save that money and build schools with it instead of wasting it on lobbying efforts that will lead to nothing . 
  we dont care and you know it too . 
  its nothing that bothers us really except for some turks online who like to battle armenians and greeks once a year . 
  fair enough . 
  but dont expect turks to trust anything coming out of the archives/historians of greece/armenia then too . 
  it goes both ways . 
   the ** only ** thing they do is denying genocides , thats what the institute is all about denying genocides . 
  thank you for your clarification . 
  sorry but while that thread is a bit cringy , i dont see any sign of brigading . 
  and i also dont see how this is relevant to r/europe or how a sub of 14.000 can manipulate a sub of 1.4 million with an anti turkish bias . 
  i 've been around long enough to know that positive news about turkey dont make it past the new page in here , worldnews or somewhere else . 
  because the only thing they do is denying genocides , thats what the institute is all about denying genocides . 
  thank you for your clarification . 
  thought it said atat\u00fcrk from the thumbnail , needless to say i 'm disappointed . 
  honestly , the small countries that joined lately , which major nato country is willing to fight a war for them ? 
  let 's go eat some souvlaki , i 'll tell you my plans for greece later . 
  ella re . 
  you take that back now or i will call you nazi . 
  d\u00f6ners of europe . 
  sumak seasoned onion . . hnnngg, 
  if you get your baklava in the same place you eat your d\u00f6ner sandwich , you 're probably only getting supermarket quality baklava , not the good one . 
  you should go to a turkish bakery once, 
  in that case i shall name myself ioannis . 
  if you turkey turns into a sharia shit hole i will take greek citizenship and call myself patros . 
  you 're wrong and you also have no idea about turkey or erdo\u011fan . 
  probably just reading headlines and the news on reddit . 
  that would rustle a lot of jimmies . 
  a lot of hippocrisy on r/europe . 
  compare this to cyprus or crimea . 
  `` the ukrainians refused to hand over peacefully , how is that our fault ? '', 
  - russia , on the annexiation of crimea, 
  ibrahim tatlises begs to differ . 
  yeah , but the referendum is over so expect softer tones now and diplomatic kamikaze around 2019 again . 
  same . 
  explain turkey and really please . 
  what does it refer to ? 
  only this leader is sitting in jail , for being the leader and founder of the pkk . 
  how would you react if that group was wearing patches of bagdadi , but not called isis but somehow in the same organization as them ? 
  not most but many . 
  but still a referendum stands no chance . 
  dont need the turkish government to tell me that a group that is building statues of a convicted terrorist leader , wearing patches of his face , alligned and part of the same organization as the pkk is crooked . 
  sweden is full of pkk supporters . 
  norway it is ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  you had a secular , stable and democratic turkey ( at least better than the turkey we have today ) in the past . 
  the turkish opposition in germany is not organized . 
  there is no single group or something . 
  its also not funded and state supported like uetd . 
  they mail everyone who 's a turk with akp letters in favor of the referendum , offer free bus rides to polling stations . 
  not really any relevance . 
  this is more about educated/uneducated , rural/city population . 
  stop trying to make this happen . 
  i live in germany man , there are more comars here than in turkey . 
  also usa seems like a bad choice coming from europe and especially germany ( sorry ) . 
  i live in comar country , amk . 
  i need to move somewhere else once i have finished my degree . 
  this , it was not exactly a fair and equal campaign . 
  please eu take save the feminist kurds and take them to europe . 
  yes , you might as well add tabriz in iran or half a dozen more central asiatic cities . 
  it would probably not even make the top 30 . 
  are you sure ? 
  there are ca . 
  250.000-300 .000 turks in berlin and according to official data that would make it the 23 . biggest turkish city . 
  parents : mercedes e-klasse me : 2007 renault clio, 
  freedom  money for me, 
  one of our problems is that the opposition is weak , the leader of the main opposition party which is the republican chp is a joke . 
  there is no dynamic in the party more or less the same old fucks imo . 
  the chp is secular and the reforms that led to our booming economy , not directly but kemal dervis was brought in when shit hit the fan . 
  the akp did a lot good and is still doing okay when it comes to economy , but they also had the of being in the right place at the right time . 
  when it comes to religious/social issues the chp changed its not as tough on religion as it used to be . 
  secularism would be maintained no matter what , the chp changed and sees that there is nothing wrong with letting headscarf wearing people into universities for example but on the other hand there is no reason for religious classes in schools . 
  the chp would reset a few reforms the akp did that were not of a secular nature . 
  the akp is already washing away the secular nature of my country , the borders between the state and religion have been away slowly but clearly fading away in the last decade . 
  but some things will never change and they know that , they tried to abolish abortions and backpedaled . 
  they banned the celebrations yesterday in ankara and nevertheless the people celebrated stormed police barricades . 
  millions of people were on the streets yesterday , even more saw policemen kicking and tear gassing people for celebrating the foundation of the republic . 
  erdogan called the thousands of people on the streets of ankara terrorists , can you believe that ? 
  i somehow wish that an economic crisis will hit turkey , because i believe that uneducated dumbfucks will vote anything as long as they have more money in the pocket at the end of the day . 
  but who knows , maybe yesterday was the day that opened the eyes of even the last idiot . 
  then on the other hand there is no real alternative , because all opposition parties suck . 
  no , its not that simple . 
  they banned the republic day celebrations and pepper sprayed innocent among them the politicians of the main opposition party . 
  needless to say that we celebrated nevertheless . 
  do n't know about them , but a lot of former soviet countries are , the only secular muslim countries are either of turkic origin or former soviet countries . 
  syria was secular too btw . 
  i 'd say that azerbaijan is the most secular muslim country . 
  anyway secularism has been watered down in turkey , its not like its used to be . 
  judges , generals , all important positions have been replaced by pro-akp people . 
  no thats not true . 
  eu-citizens are allowed to have multiple citizenships .

ahahaha lol, 
  you seriously have been trying to prove that i hate french !, 
  wow !, 
  just wow !, 
  i have n't write anything about ` french ' . 
  ' ... s\u0131z ' means without in turkish . 
  it 's a general rule for all words . 
  you should n't blurring people 's mind . 
  i have n't met anyone french in turkey . 
  how can i have negative experiences about their visits ? 
  if it was french , i would just say it 's french . 
  we are on internet . 
  why would i be scared ? 
  i just do n't want to break hearts the people i like . 
  i deleted comments because i regret my words . 
  not because it was french . 
  you misunderstood it and now you spreading it to others ... you do n't even speak turkish , you are from austria . 
  lol, 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i have n't seen any french in turkey yet . 
  you only visit historical places i guess , because you have your own beaches . 
  so french option was out already . 
  nah , it 's probaby invented thousands of years ago in fertile crescent before we turks arrived . 
  well i do n't think turks invented it that 's the difference . 
  we exchanged many words throughout history i guess . 
  hungarian sounds so beautiful . 
  there are hungarian words in the beginning of [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzyzpanbf6g ) and my hairs rise when i listen, 
  stating that yogurt is n't derived from the turkish language means that turks have invented it too . 
  that smell in bathroom after eating it ... loool, 
  stating that yogurt derived from turkish language does n't mean turks invented it either . 
  can you show me which part did i mention about inventing anything ? 
  i have never eaten that sh.t !, 
  past\u0131rma is so expensive though , it 's hard to eat . 
  seems like you have many friends from turkish minority , no more reveal our primitive traditions, 
  raw garlic with yogurt is perfect !, 
  but you should n't go out next two days lol, 
  owner of chobani said : `` i moved from turkey because i 'm a kurd . '', 
  so he may even call his yoghurt `` cambodian yoghurt '' but not `` turkish yoghurt '' . 
  they want to sell it before we capture . 
  etymology of yogurt :  the word is derived from turkish : yo\u011furt , and is usually related to the verb yo\u011furmak , `` to knead '' , or `` to be curdled or coagulated ; to thicken '' . 
  ohh yeah , tasty sour turkish [ yogurt ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bhhtqsealhc/?tagged=yo%c4%9furt ), 
  his height is disputed . 
  currently world 's tallest man alive ** measured ** by guinness world records is [ sultan k\u00f6sen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sultan_k%c3%b6sen ) from turkey with his ** 2.51 ** m height . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtdtrfhv_cu ) , he is in london with world 's shortest man . 
  261 m with antenna . 
  without antenna sapphire is 236 m. 
  i think i 'm misinformed previously . 
  a news source says that the bridge is currently free but after july 11 , it will cost $ 21 for motorcycles , ** $ 30 ** for cars , $ 62 for biggest trucks . 
  it 's ** one way ** and the price ** is n't included ** price of highway . 
  however since highway is n't complated there is no good information about it . 
  yes , there is a bay on marmara sea . 
  this bridge decreased 80 km road to 3 km . 
  the new highway will connect three major cities after complated ( istanbul - bursa - izmir ) reducing 8 hours road to 3.5 hours . 
  the price is astronomical though , $ 35 + 8 % purchase tax . 
  lol i ca n't write long messages really and somehow i needed to response so ... 
  it 's so nice , history is history . 
  we all should be friends . 
   a prostitution like relationship . 
  no offence but it 's easy to understand why you think like this from your flair . 
  those africans should pray 10 times to their holy trees for the conquerors who has been bringing civilisation . 
  btw you should be thankful to england too . 
  yes , initally planned as with time many nations developed special relationship both as governments and as people . 
  it 's similar to forming of nations . 
  so why do we deny that ? 
  if you take denmark . 
  do you really think that danish government does policies based on solely its interests toward sweden ? 
  i mean same level with vietnam ? 
  all the democratic organizations run by individuals who is elected by people who have very solid and probably wrong idea for visa policy of their country . 
  ( that 's why we have indirect democracy ) so even if the government can satisfy , convince its public with something disputed ( in brexit case we saw how a government failed ) the individuals who rule country are n't perfectly rational . 
  they have very much emotional decisions and they wo n't even deny it . 
  also forget about conspiracy theories that international aid ** just ** for benefit . 
  i agree that there are many people who just seek for their interest but it 's not strong as nations before . 
  before even regionalism was very strong . 
  some prime ministers in turkey enlarged their hometowns ' borders . 
  i mean it 's even crazy to think something like this now . 
  as you know , there are many phases in history . 
  nation concept on people 's mind is relatively new . 
  so i think this phrase is totally wrong for the times before 1700 when people identify themselves with their kingdom and religion . 
  i do n't know how exactly nation concept developed , however we may say nationalism gradually increased until ww2 and then decreased dramatically . 
  in addition people dreamed a world all people share and developed international organizations for the first time . 
  so i think this phrase is outdated . 
  because it ignores : * both friendship and enmity of nations * flowing of hundreds of billion dollars aid money to undeveloped world every year * a big population who define themselves as world citizen on their upper-identity . 
  * organizations such as eu , nato which softly force nations to move on common base . 
  it also assumes that humans act rational rather than emotional . 
  you can find many researchs about how we fail to detect our emotional actions while we purchase , invest on a stock . 
  so i can easily assume that many nations and their governments do politics based on their ` left brain ' . 
  so this phrase may be close to true for world wars times when nationalism high rocketed . 
  but for now it 's outdated and wrong . 
  this is so wrong in many ways in today 's world . 
  what 's your business with istanbul aka byzantium aka constantinople ? 
  end this theater !, 
  we will never be member of eu . 
  we have to accept it and focus on a state 's first duty : protecting lifes of its citizens !, 
  no more soft power shit , environmental issues , street animals bla bla we want war !, 
  and just now !, 
  i think it 's time to remove turkey from / r/europe and add to / r/middleeasternshithole, 
  no need to be sorry , there is no hope for future of turkey . 
  we 'll get used to it eventually . 
  istanbul is literally baghdad 2.0 now . 
  how do you even know about euro 2016 ?

  buying greece would probably be easier though . 
  here you go , a 100 dollar bill ... now gim me the 99 dollar change . 
   yeah ... no . 
  we have plenty of religious people in europe too . 
  the problem starts when you try to enforce your views on others . 
  you do n't need to enforce your views on others . 
  you start getting weird looks as soon as people think you are a muslim . 
  and plenty of religious people ? 
  you mean christians ? 
   look , i do n't want to insult you but that 's definitely inferiority complex . 
  well it stops people from treating me weird . 
  unless you are an armenian . 
  in that case awkward moments galore . 
  i know what inferiority complex looks like dude . 
  i could tell you a story if i had time . 
  i wish they just built a big ass wall on the border of middle east and vowed to never intervene really . 
  i mean [ your least extreme person ] ( http://i.imgur.com/c2qgih.jpg ) can be unreliable and [ fuck things up further ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/covert_united_states_foreign_regime_change_actions ) sometimes . 
  atat\u00fcrk 's mistake was being too lenient with islamists and trying to go democratic too fast . 
  should have hanged them all and continued the dictatorship for a while . 
  democracy with uneducated fools only means idiots get to pick who rules the country . 
  i laughed my ass off when i learned akp won . 
  i do n't know why . 
  he did n't do anything !, 
  that 's why he sucks !, 
  turkish history of politics has never seen such a passive politician ever . 
  you can name it `` republic of turks suck and greeks rule '' if it gets us outta this mess . 
  converting to orthodoxy ... well i kept up the appearance of being a muslim for years while subtly insulting all religions . 
  i 'll only have to act like an orthodox now . 
   switch to byzantine idea group i 'm pretty sure turkish idea group actually gives us negative effects as we unlock them so i do n't mind . 
   primary culture is greek or pontic greek get ready to spend some bird mana dudes . 
  i have a better idea . 
  [ nope the fuck out ] ( http://media.altersozluk.com/entries/1015/10151/543a9aff39535.jpg ) maybe we can saw north cyprus off and glue it to hatay as one final `` fuck you '' to eu , for old times ' sake . 
  he was always an extreme islamist . 
  he was a puppet of the west so you guys turned a blind eye to it . 
  akp has always been like this . 
  now they are powerful , they are less subtle about it . 
  abdullah g\u00fcl , one of the founding members of akp , said that republic has ran its ' course and he also said that they want to change this secular system . 
  he said those in 1995 . 
  never heard of it ? 
  not surprised . 
  there are rumors of fraud . 
  [ a guy here shows evidence of votes being higher than the amount of voters ] ( http://onedio.com/haber/bir-twitter-kullanicisindan-gelen-artan-oy-sayisi-tespiti-kafa-karistirdi-616582 ) also fuat avni ( a whistleblower spy-like dude who has a tendency to know things before they happen ) is also saying some fraud went down . 
  to be honest i do n't think fraud had that big of an effect but anyway . 
  [ i wrote about my take here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3qz4c7/turkey_heads_to_polls_tomorrow_info_thread/cwkn9c1?context=3 ), 
  but we love azerbaijanis and south koreans . 
  yeah they sure love you if you have like a tattoo on your forehead which says `` atheist freedom-loving normal dude '' or something similar . 
  otherwise they treat you like a typical brown trash . 
  i always try to point out that i 'm an atheist when people give me that look when i say i 'm turkish . 
  plenty of people hate turks regardless but that cools down the islam-hating folks . 
  takes a while to get around prejudices no matter what . 
  tbh i would hate turks if i was them too . 
  turks in europe are the worst kind of turks . 
  turkey deserves a lot worse with this election outcome . 
  not to mention our bloody history . 
  only thing that troubles me is they do n't allow turks into some clubs in germany lol . 
  you really think the mentality that did mad\u0131mak massacre would fight for secularism under threat of sharia ? 
  yeah it 's not about religion , but religion is the catalyst . 
  it will go to shit either way . 
   how would kurdish akp voters feel about a turkish invasion of rojava ? 
  to be honest people really do n't care that much about whatever goes on beyond the borders . 
  the split is big enough for them to kill each other over it . 
  h\u00dcdapar and hdp member clash sometimes . 
  h\u00dcdapar is basically kurdish hizbollah . 
  most kurds are very conservative and religious . 
  hdp leadership is secular and more to the left but their voters and outer-ring members are n't . 
  hell , a member of hdp once said they favor sharia law . 
  the only reason kurds were voting for hdp was because hdp was a kurdish party ( nationalism ) . 
  this is why hdp and akp share a voterbase . 
  akp is n't a kurdish party but they are n't nationalist at all when it comes to turkish nationalism . 
  so kurds are okay with it . 
  akp is islamist which is a big pull for kurds . 
  oh you were ` murica the world police . 
  thought you were germoney for a second . 
  yeah , you ca n't even imagine how insulting it is to talk about eu membership to a turk . 
  there are rumors of fraud . 
  apparently there are more votes than the number of voters in some provinces, 
  right wing voters are more organized and have higher attendance in elections worldwide . 
  akp sometimes pays people to vote for them , gives them bags of coal , pasta , etc , and sends buses to their houses to take them to ballots . 
  this means uneducated and poor are more likely to go through the trouble of voting . 
  dude at this point i want both hdp and mhp to stay below 10 % . 
  they both done incredibly stupid shit and they fucking deserve it . 
  i want akp to get like 90 % . 
  i 'm feeling like a masochist . 
  i want akp to have full power over turkey and i want them to take the blame when things go to shit . 
  drop a nuke on us or something i do n't care . 
  1.5 % from sp . 
  sp is basically akp but even more extremist . 
  they probably decided to vote akp when they saw akp having trouble with the last election . 
  those are people who are fed up with mhp being incredibly passive . 
  hdp lost 3 % . 
  i think those are the religious and conservative kurds . 
  chp pretty much remained the same and since a chp voter would never vote for akp , it 's irrelevant . 
  1.5 +5 +3 = 9.5 % also a big thank you goes to pkk for breaking the ceasefire and giving akp the opportunity get nationalist votes . 
  they are more worthless than mosquitoes i kill without a thought . 
  seriously nobody except non-turks care about turkey 's eu ascension and it 's getting annoying seeing europeans pull the eu card at everything . 
  ca n't use that as a stick with a carrot at the end of it anymore . 
  many anti-akp turks also dislike the west . 
  then next time you lose a war , form civilian resistance groups and fight an independence war rather than just backing down like a bunch of pussies . 
  oh man , i forgot about saudis . 
  those guys completely eclipse us in the `` going bananas in the name of your imaginary friend '' thing .

  okay , now you 're just being schizophrenic . 
  are you threatening me or something ? 
  why would i die ? 
  if the west moves in to take out erdogan they will most certainly not give power to another erdogan . 
  50 % of the country is modern liberal and western , moreso than bulgaria has ever been . 
  it 's not just another iraq . 
  what did you find uncivilized in my comments ? 
  uh , yes there is still a turkish people in that case . 
  their descandants do n't just stop existing , they are just relabeled as another thing . 
  this has happened a billion times in anatolia , first the greeks hellenized us , then turkic tribes turkified and islamized us . 
  we are still here . 
  edit : just so you know , i 've checked your comment history ( sorry ) and i know what you are . 
  do n't expect me to reply if you go full retard . 
  these are not insults , they 're just fairly neutral facts . 
  no one has ever cared what you guys think , sadly . 
   we 've been with russia for years mate . 
  still have good relations , tons of their tourists around . 
  yeah , i 'm sure putin will use lube when he 's fucking your country next time . 
   and west is giving you that treatment more and more each day . 
  keep it going and lets see who is going to get steamrolled . 
  we 'll get steamrolled and dragged to the european side and we 'll rebuild and be relevant , unlike bulgaria , who does * nothing * . 
  which ? 
  i hope he didi n't tell turks to kill westerners . 
  kek , you can keep pretending it has no meaning . 
  most of reddit knows exactly what it means . 
  okay , i 'll start hating on every phillipine i see then . 
  chinese too . 
  oh , anyone from north korea aswell . 
  how about syrians ? 
  let 's go all the way through with it shall we ? 
  what are these processes that ca n't be reverted later ? 
  muscles ? 
  this the other guy is just taking out of his ass, 
  young men are n't married . 
  indeed , but the greeks do n't deserve that . 
  i think our very existance is enough mental punishment for those cunts . 
  you pretend somehow that it matters what you feel about these huge geopolitical decisions . 
  bulgarians have never mattered . 
  you are the ones who will sink into oblivion as soon as the tides change and the west no longer feels to protect you from russia or other closer maniacs . 
  maybe he did , explain the killing part . 
  nope , just saying you east europeans are n't relevant to the discussion , as always . 
  of course , if you want to be under russian occupation again which clearly catapulted your mentalities back to the iron age , then sure , you do n't need us . 
  what they mean with `` europe '' is `` western europe '', 
  explain, 
  my dad works at playstation ur banned have fun, 
  okay added you , i 'm xxxopticzzsepirothxxx i 'm a member of optic ur fucked bro my dad works at xbox ill get u banned, 
  yeah , that 's what i mean . 
  black clothing + running people over seems very isis, 
  neither please, 
  why would puberty make them suffer ? 
  for these kinds of life changing decisions you need to be fully mature and aware, 
  now you know how i feel when i see muricans from bumfuckville hoping that constantinople returns to christian hands . 
  i saw him trolling earlier, 
  small if false, 
  yeah i 'm slightly uncomfortable with that , was n't even aware you could change genders before 18, 
  1v1 rust intervention only, 
  ah , young men , famously not in need of food and water . 
  you really know nothing of this country, 
   i still really have no idea what alt-right is , the term 's definition seems to change on the daily . 
  so i 'm going to go on a limb here and say i am not alt-right . 
  huh , another who denies the meaning of alt-right . 
  i 'm sure you are a very reasonable level headed person though . 
   i would like to remove kebab oh, 
  okay then , i do n't think this is matter of opinion really but okay . 
  not familiar with that expression . 
  well , that would imply being atheist makes you non-western . 
  what i mean by catholicism is non-colonial catholic heritage , i.e protestant and atheist nations are included . 
  not sure what the map is supposed to prove , but dayum , el salvador . 
  meh , it 's fine . 
  being fat makes your arteries clog up , not eating cheese . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:ottoman_architecture https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:buildings_and_structures_of_the_ottoman_empire a shitton of stuff , in fact i do n't remember any other noteworthy arcitecture existing in balkan states except greece and turkey . 
  jeez , i touched a nerve there . 
   there 's nothing more ridiculous than someone laughing on his own ignorance and missconseptions . 
  or a furious greek trying to be western . 
   the `` west '' is a term to discribe a certain civilization : the greco-roman one . 
  the term might have been used later but it always refered to exactly that . 
  currently looking it up , and * ancient greece * is described like ancient israel , a contributor . 
  modern greece is byzantine . 
   christianity became part of the western identity later . 
  catholicism that is . 
  and no it 's pretty much the core definition of western civilization . 
   it 's not even necessary to be part of the west , as many heathen ( were ) or atheist nations belong to the west . 
  not a necessity maybe , but it 's hard to be `` western '' if you lack the core of it . 
   it 's not surprizing that you have this misconception about what is western because it is a cultural thing to which you dont belong . 
  i do n't think you need to belong to a certain thing to understand it , beside , you 're not part of it either . 
   just look at the state of modern turkey . 
  after a century of securalism the country goes full speed to become something like pakistan . 
  a theocratic state . 
  all the western values failed cause they were foreign to your culture . 
  yet you think you know what `` west '' is lol . 
  this is n't about turkey to begin with . 
  and as i said , i do n't have to be western to know what western is , i can just look it up . 
   it is not a geographical term ( australia is a western society ) and certainly not a religious one . 
  surely islam would never appeal the west as it has many elements that contradict our civilization . 
  it 's applied to people of a certain descent and culture aswell , like australia , who are mostly british . 
  islam by definition is non-western , so yes . 
   do yourself a favor and try to educate yourself a bit : oookay . 
   historian es creasy , in 1851 , included marathon in his account of the 15 decisive battles of world history , and more famously , in 1846 , john stuart mill declared in his essay on early grecian history and legend : `` the true ancestors of the european nations are not those from whose blood they are sprung , but those from whom they derive the richest portion of their inheritance . 
  the battle of marathon , even as an event in british history , is more important than battle of hastings . 
  if the issue of that day had been different , the britons and the s might still have been wandering in the woods . '' so a random quote changes reality now ?

  holy shit who is that, 
  are those votes popular & jury combined or jury only ? 
  random voting , random voting everywhere, 
  wish there was turkey too . 
  i think ukraine will win the popular vote but russia will win the overall ( popular + jury ), 
  oddschecker going crazy for russia . 
  he meant that skilled people who want to migrate to usa can speak english properly . 
  so in case of migration , language wo n't be problem for them . 
   do you think its because those migrants are sometimes underinformed on the issue , or because they are so highly educated/skilled that they dont have to care ? 
  those people think 2 things : 1 . 
  how good i 'll be paid ? 
  ( since we 're talking about engineers , doctors etc ) 2 . 
  how free i 'll be ? 
  why do n't they migrate to austria ? 
  because ; 1 . 
  it 's not as `` catchy '' as canada for example . 
  the most cancerous turkish diaspora in the world lives there . 
  conservative , pro-tayyip , every stereotype new migrants escape from . 
  mostly usa , also australia , canada are highly chosen . 
  countries like germany , netherlands , france are highly unlikely migration destinations because of * cough * diaspora * cough *, 
  shit mustafa akyol says . 
  i 'd understand if a western journalist wrote it but you live in turkey , you 're supposed to know things better than them yet you have the same knowledge level with them . 
  erdo\u011fan was n't even liberal to begin with , he had been called like that because he was useful tool for usa back then . 
  he was islamist as fuck during 90 's , he got arrested for provoking the people , then acquitted , then use it for agitation , then finally he came to power in 2002 . 
  he never approach to `` common sense '' , he had `` you are either with us or with others '' mentality that alienated a good amount of people since his election . 
  he said so many things that anger his secular opponents ( i wo n't write them , you can google it , there are tons of them ) and caused [ republic protests ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_protests ) , he got really really angry about it and started his own nuremberg trials ( [ ergenekon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ergenekon_trials ) and [ balyoz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sledgehammer_\\ ( coup_plan \\ ) ) ) on known secularists and army . 
  they were the days if you are known , secular and oppose akp , you have 98 % chance to get arrested for being a member of `` ergenekon '' . 
  last damage was destroying the jurisdiction via [ 2010 constitutional referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_constitutional_referendum,_2010 ) . 
  they did successfully hide what they were actually wanting and used `` we 're removing the remnants of '80 coup '' rhetoric . 
  after eliminating the jurisdiction , nothing left to be afraid for tayyip . 
  you know the rest of the story . 
  those are what things were before 2011 , in other words , those were what happened in turkey while tayyip represented as superman in western media . 
  eu membership is not a single-issue voting concern . 
  in other words , nobody would vote for any candidate just for being pro-eu . 
  being conservative or being la\u00efc is one of the main issues to vote for here , eu membership is on second plan . 
  in addition to that , people generally do n't care about eu anymore ( i know i 'm the millionth person who say that but still ) , conservative people do n't want for obvious reasons , secular/la \u00efc / pro-western/whatever you call people do n't give it priority . 
  \\  natural let 's call it historical obsession . 
  \\  using the name constantinople and trebizond unironically . 
  you 're right . 
  however , an average mehmet still ca n't afford a turkish passport . 
  threshold has to be decreased to decent percentage like 3 % , but thankfully , we do n't have first past the post system although akp wanted to put it into force a few years ago . 
  i can not imagine what would the political environment be in turkey if we had fptp and 10 % threshold . 
  i do n't get why he insist on visa-free travel anyway . 
  if he wanted us to go abroad , he would n't made turkish passport to be [ the most expensive one ] ( https://www.statista.com/chart/4031/the-worlds-most-expensive-passports/ ) . 
  10 % threshold put into effect by the junta to block pro-kurdish and islamists parties entering the parliament . 
  it 's still in force because parties in parliament love it more than anything . 
  it helps to create monopolies , if it was 5 % then there would be lots of small parties in the parliament and those big parties would lose their advantage . 
  [ 2002 elections ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_general_election,_2002 ) was bloodshed and akp got % 66 of seats with % 34 vote because of the threshold . 
  i do n't think he cares about eu parliament either . 
   i 'm wondering what will happen in the next months in turkey . 
  we also do n't know , [ chp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republican_people%27s_party_\\ ( turkey \\ ) ) keep acting like they live in norway or switzerland . 
  opposition within [ mhp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalist_movement_party ) getting stronger and probably they overthrow [ devlet bah\u00e7eli ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/devlet_bah\u00e7eli ) in the upcoming convention . 
  he and his incompetence are the main reason of akp votes . 
  if [ meral ak\u015fener ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meral_ak\u015fener ) become the leader of mhp , many things may change , maybe not . 
  other than that , they keep oppressing the people and disperse any rally from the beginning . 
  akp do n't want another gezi protests , that 's for sure . 
   what will davutoglu do now ? 
  probably nothing , he 'll be fade away like abdullah g\u00fcl at worst . 
   is a split inside the akp possible ? 
  that 's a wild card , i believe that there 's silent opposition within akp that may show up , it depends on progress . 
   i think that erdogan is trying to gain consensus among his voters , but he is also pissing off a lot of people inside his country . 
  not every akp voter is mindless tayyip drones . 
  he also piss off a lot of his voters , mainly non-islamist centre-right supporters who voted for [ anap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/motherland_party_\\ ( turkey \\ ) ) and [ dyp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_party_\\ ( turkey , _ current \\ ) ) back then . 
  they still vote for akp because there 's no centre-right alternative besides akp , akp succesfully eliminated or assimilated other centre-right parties . 
  who knows what the future holds ? 
  [ relevant . 
   is the parliament really going to give him pass ? 
  what parliament ? 
  does he look like someone who cares about parliament ? 
  so i 'm 22 cm taller than average , hmm ... 
  it 's not about russian media nor russian state . 
  chechens are the main supporters of islamic terrorism hence islamic state . 
  you can find chechens in any islamic terror organisation . 
  they have probably the most islamic terrorists per population . 
   hdp is a pro-minority political party in turkey . 
  generally left-wing , the party places a strong emphasis on participatory democracy , feminism , minority rights , and egalitarianism . 
  it is an associate member of the party of european socialists ( pes ) and consultative member of the socialist international . 
  hdp want to be like that in order to avoid to be looked like single issue party . 
  their raison d'\u00eatre is autonomy for south-eastern turkey . 
  yes , they show themselves as a progressive party in the western turkey and actually half of their mp 's are women as far as i know but i do n't think they 're neither founded nor continue as a progressive party . 
  why i think that ? 
  because otherwise they would 've said a word or two on feudalism in the eastern turkey . 
  yet they 're pandering landlords to get votes , let alone speak against the feudalism and plan to abolish it . 
  they commemmorate sheikh said 's death , who rebelled against newly-founded secular republic in order to establish a sharia state for both turks and kurds . 
  not exactly a progressive move , is n't it ? 
  i do n't care what they advocate to , i 'm not a nationalist . 
  if their only goal is for autonomy in south-eastern turkey so let them speak . 
  they got elected by the population so it 's their right to be in the parliament and speak what they want . 
  i just do n't want them to show themselves as a progressive party because they are n't . 
  neither their voterbase not they are not progressive . 
  sexy non-headscarved ypg chicks fighting against isis do n't make majority of kurds progressive . 
  72 virgins . 
  at least there is an actual opposition party to erdo and sizable population is against him in turkey . 
  russia on the other hand , well , there is n't any . 
  exact the same is happening in turkey . 
  now british people know what kind of people we 're dealing with for 15 years . 
  in the east ? 
  cheap country eurovision 2017 host i see ukrainian tourists regularly . 
  the nation is divided between pro-eu and pro-russia camps . 
  their women are gorgeous .

  britain now dominates a thoroughly stagnated atlantic europe . 
  the most controversial section of the treaty is the article providing that only america will have access to militarize space , while other countries will only be able to have commercial activity . '', 
  assad too buys oil from isis , just sayin, 
  u got a problem ? 
  imagine if erdogan arms the ukrainians , chechens , dagestanis etc. 
  that would also be cool . 
  does russia even have any major trading partners left ? 
  entire europe is sanctioning them , along with the us . 
  it 's only a matter of time that russia goes bankrupt . 
  and being involved in so many conflicts ( ukraine , syria ) is n't really helping their economy . 
  damn , the russians are butthurt . 
  poor poor putin, 
  sure buddy, 
  how exactly is all this relevant to this thread ? 
   you are coming from a country committed genocide in armenia stopped reading your comment after your first sentence . 
  turkey 's version of godwin 's law, 
  russia today went full retard after we shot their jet down . 
  some of the articles they published were seriously laughable . 
  quality journalism right there, 
  i think you may have reading comprehension problems, 
  you have no fucking idea what you are talking about, 
  assad used chemical weapons on his own people . 
  assad is not any better than isis . 
  russia will still keep denying though . 
  remember how they lied that there were no russian soldiers in crimea and ukraine . 
  or how they denied the downing of mh17, 
  ukraine , you have our full support . 
  it was n't the first time though . 
  a few weeks ago turkey complained to the un that russia was violating it 's airspace and that they will do something about it if it continues . 
  russia still continued doing it , and turkey responded this time . 
  and now the russians are whining, 
  `` that will show em ! '', 
  it was just a factory accident ... 
   were n't most of those kurdish protesters ? 
  no , most of them were leftist turks . 
  leftist kurds also died , but most of them were turks . 
   turkey bombs kurds in syria that fight isis turkey never bombed the kurds in syria . 
  turkey bombs pkk positions in ** northern iraq ** . 
  turkey wants assad and the ypg/pkk gone . 
  isis fights against assad and ypg/pkk . 
  so , turkey tolerates isis . 
  for us , it 's basically terrorists killing terrorists . 
  but saying `` turkey supports isis '' is wrong . 
  if they supported isis , why would they bomb and arrest them ? 
  turkey arrested more isis terrorists than any other country . 
  isis also committed the ankara and suruc bombings , which killed about 200 turkish citizens . 
  if turkey really supported isis , why would isis commit those attacks ? 
  isis also said they want to conquer istanbul , along with other european cities . 
  a war between turkey & russia would cause a world war . 
  use your fucking brain before you spew such bullshit, 
  when istanbul burns , moscow burns too . 
  you have no fucking idea what you are talking about, 
  just like mh17 !, 
  armenia has a military ? 
  greece does the same thing ... 
  it 's not even a big deal, 
  you mean mh17, 
   when did russia shoot turkish jet ? 
  they shoot down civilian airliners tho * cough * ^ ^ ^ mh17 * cough *, 
  me too . 
  sometimes , when i 'm in the metro , i wonder what would happen if i suddenly screamed `` allahu akbar ! '', 
  while riding the metro . 
  lol , i 'd probably get beaten up, 
  classic isis supporting turkey ^ ^ / s first they warned france twice about the paris attackers , and now this . 
  it will be da bomb, 
  ** hahahahahahaha **, 
  lmfao indeed my scottish friend so funny im dying right now wow i cant even u such a funny scott, 
   the un predicts sweden to be a third world country in 15 years lmfao, 
  lol , i asked myself this too pretty often . 
  hmmmm dead people , makes me feel warm and fuzzy . 
  nah , dont u know , ataturk was a zionist atheist jew working for the american & european imperialists . 
  some people ( islamists ) seriously believe this , i 'm not joking . 
  a better source would be nice . 
  that 's not even true . 
  funny , when a t\u00fcrke knows more about merkel 's policy than a german living in germany . 
  there even have been wars over it, 
  lol , your article does n't even say that, 
  bulgarian 's are just turks who got christianized  yogurt is definitely a turkish ( central asian ) invention . 
  i read autism and was confused for a few seconds lol, 
  same for me with raki . 
  as a teenager , i nearly died once because of too much raki . 
  since then , i ca n't drink it without puking . 
  alone the smell makes me nauseous . 
  i love vodka tho . 
  but beer is still the best, 
  i laughed too , and then i cried . 
  and then i nearly got a panic attack , i kid you not . 
  they are islamists . 
  i dont know . 
  maybe if we were n't such a backwarded and retarded nation , some would like us ?? 
  even i , as a turk , fucking hate most of my own people . 
  i seriously would n't mind if 50 % of our population just got eradicated, 
  bahceli is one of the most pathetic politicians of turkey , along with erdogan . 
  fuck this country, 
  yea , because afghanistan is so safe and peaceful . 
  greece or georgia edit : oh shit , totally forgot azerbaijan lol . 
  azerbaijan number one neighbour, 
   yes geopolitics do in fact care about emotions . 
  not really . 
  if you really think so , you have no idea .

[ diplomatic immunity ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0coihdwlz4 ), 
  stupid one uppers . 
  everybody knows belgian beer is best beer . 
  probably they meant to draw inse belgium but it did n't fit . 
  or the artist was stupid and believed the term `` french fries '' from american english . 
  ah the good old latin phrase inversion . 
  parent meant industrial energy consumption . 
  probably multiple orders of magnitude bigger than what you can burn with vehicles . 
  turkish people know romania as one of the typical poor ex-communist countries . 
  there were a few famous romanian football players back in time . 
  there is a significant `` native '' gypsy population in turkey , so we are well aware of the distinction . 
  the politically correct term for a gypsy is `` roman '' while the term romainan is `` romen '' . 
  also there is a stereotype ( that i find disgusting ) is that eastern european girls are easy/sluts . 
  we do n't need that . 
  we can ask moderators to take action against such accusations . 
  [ h\u00fclooo ] ( http://youtu.be/b3ulsnqugao?t=15s ), 
  6m caliber would be bigger than [ these guns ] ( http://images.dakkadakka.com/gallery/2009/3/27/24764_md-apocalypse,%20titan,%20warhammer%2040,000,%20warlord.jpg ), 
  and * only * 800mm caliber . 
  afaik they not directly involved . 
  but hurriyet is owned by do\u011fan media group , which is a collection of different companies . 
  they quit serving akp propaganda anout 2 years ago , and i do n't know the exact reason . 
  here is my guess : quite a few turkish companies belong to g\u00fclen followers , and you can not simply avoid all of them and stay in the business world . 
  when the akp - g\u00fclen allicance started to crack a few years ago , they had to choose sides . 
  they are simply following money . 
  however , since akp is really heavy on propaganda and blatant lies , just serving news against them happens to be more on the side of the truth at the moment . 
  yes , zaman is directly owned by them , and their main propaganda channel . 
  i do n't know any realiable channels in turkish , save for english . 
  i suggest you to skim over multiple sources from different channels : hurriyetdailynews today 's zaman http://www.turkishpress.com/ are the 3 of them i can find . 
  yes , fethullan g\u00fclen is leading a `` religious charity '' movement sinde 1980s . 
  the turkish and european editions are certainly different . 
  the immigranst in europe have a lower level of education overall , and they cater to that market . 
  turkey edition used to be pro-erdo\u011fan a few years ago but then their business interests started to collide . 
  although i am more or less happy with their current stance , the reason behind is strictly business . 
  their political stance changes with the winds , however currently they are the most serious of the popular bunch . 
  that is awesome . 
  in my home country isps file criminal complaints . 
  belgium , luxembourg , switzerland : does not compute . 
  more or less the same in turkey . 
  single sex ones are long established , good schools . 
  on the other hand , most of these high quality schools quit being single sex in the last decade . 
  most of them were also boarding schools , so they had to do some dorm arrengements . 
  on the other hand , now there are some ideas to make regular schools single sex for the sake of it . 
  ah sad . 
  this reminds me , single sex schools are rare in turkey but our beloved ( ! ), 
  pm wants to convert a lot of existing schools to single-sex . 
  just some bloke who lived in several parts of eastern and western europe . 
  i have n't lived in czech , just went for visiting , but knew some cz people . 
  still i developed an affinity for you people . 
  i love the czech . 
  yeah , lived in nl for a while , your beer sucks . 
  happier on just the other side of the border . 
  i love you cz . 
  you are awesome . 
  but the order of the colours say belgium not deutschland . 
  more people should do that . 
  calling the police , i mean . 
  it is ironic that , few days ago police was ordered to withdraw from the square , and the whole `` mob '' sat there peacefully ; playing music , reading , and cleaning the streets . 
  violence restarted when the police came back . 
  off topic : i was in sarajevo and bjelasnica in 2005 and 2013 . 
  i love the people and the food . 
  the shitty part is , he sees he shot someone , and his first reaction is to run away . 
  it seems like an accident to me as well , but he should have never reached to his gun in the first place , he was not in mortal danger . 
  he is not fit for the responsibility of carrying a firearm . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0das16bs6jy if that does n't work , search for `` ethem sar\u0131s\u00fcl\u00fck '' . 
  you will see there are a lot of copies on youtube but most of them are taken down . 
  apparently someone has been busy online . 
  what gave you that impression ? 
  this should be the standard way of resolving conflicts . 
   it 's obvious that assad has no authority over the country anymore i wonder why . 
  i also wonder why local people run from rebel controlled areas to assad 's territory when they have the chance . 
  no , vpn providers and applications are blocked via `` antivirus solution '' of the company . 
  but i have my cell phone with data , which is not bad . 
  also i uploaded stuff to google play music , which is not blocked . 
  the fremen are used to traveling in harsh desert conditions . 
  i work for a german company , and all our internet connection is proxied through the company hq in germany . 
  that 's why i ca n't use youtube for music at work . 
  i know there are better alternatives but this is the way i used to casually enjoy it when i 'm choosing at a workstation and shit sucks . 
  duck you gema . 
  i do n't even live in germany and still have to suffer through your asshatery . 
   turkey   euromonies l\u00f6l, 
  you clearly mean realistic . 
  ah an opinion that acknowledges both sides of the conflict are shitty ? 
  get out of reddit !, 
  we need more kurds can not do wrong posts . 
  that is bullshit . 
  three women spotted naked in cihangir , the police intervened pretty much everywhere . 
  also why use water cannons on naked people ? 
  a few days ago there was a home brewing site shared in / r/turkey i think iyibira.com . 
  with it , there was a site selling home brewing materials but i can not remember that one . 
  still , wine and raki are easier to make . 
  edit : sihirlimalt.com, 
  good . 
  alcohol is fucking expensive in turkey . 
  making own `` bogma raki '' is the way to go . 
   but after 1984 happened suser here . 
  which event are referring to ? 
  handover to kanzuk ? 
  vodka bottle . 
  have n't got the memo ? 
  isis is literally the only thing standing between us and world peace !,

  repeat this enough times for world domination . 
  the british channel will be hard though . 
  are we allowed to use catapults ? 
  some islamist `` historians '' claim that atat\u00fcrk was never even in gallipoli ( despite mountains of evidence ) . 
  it gets really weird one maniac even claimed that the battle of gallipoli was won because allah sent wild animals from the gallipoli forests to eat the brits . 
  the best part is there was n't even forests there back then , the forestation was done artificially in the 40s . 
  islamists do n't have a great relationship with facts . 
  if they were capable of separating actual history and bs conspiracy they would n't be islamists in the first place . 
  islamists have a twisted conspiracy based understanding of wwi history involving atat\u00fcrk being a british agent ( gallipoli was part of the plan i guess ) and trying to make turkey lose as much land as possible and later `` christianizing '' ( they mean secularizing ) the land that was left to us . 
  he 's not mad enough to actually claim greek territory . 
  that 's a domestic politics move , he 's trying to hurt atat\u00fcrk 's legitimacy by attacking lausanne . 
  makes sense . 
  there are far less licensed women chess players than men . 
  women 's tournaments are a form of positive discrimination to get more women to win awards and get women interested in chess . 
  it 's not like sports though , there is n't total segregation . 
  men ca n't compete in women 's tournaments but women can , and do compete in general tournaments . 
  there indeed are women considered top players of their time , but their numbers in top tiers are proportional to their percentage in general chess players . 
  fa\u00e7a is also the slang word for face in turkish . 
  wonder what 's the origin . 
  also `` fa\u00e7a atmak '' is slang for cutting yourself with a knife/razor etc. 
  last elections , trustable pollsters who usually find something close to truth were completely off with about 10-15 % mistake . 
  erdo\u011fan supporting polling companies who lie before every election showing akp 5-10 % higher for public perception were off too , akp got even 5 % higher than they `` polled '' . 
  easiest thing to think is fraud , but people all over the country got reports from over 90 % of the ballot boxes , they did cheat like always but it was n't over 2-3 % . 
  how do you explain that ? 
  it 's more than that . 
  people just lie in the polls . 
  do n't ask me why , they just do . 
  in turkey we constantly have over 80 % participation in elections , and polls are still always wrong . 
  is there any incident other than that egyptian guy ? 
  by `` expelling greeks '' i guess you 're referring to the population exchange v. greece and turkey . 
  it was mutual . 
  treaty of sevres was signed by ottomans before the independence war , it never even entered into force because the turkish people did n't accept it . 
  what actually set the terms of the end of the ottomans and foundation of the republic was treaty of lausanne , sevres would keep ottoman monarchy alive . 
  sevres was signed in 1920 btw , but you think it somehow affected something that happened in 1915 . 
  i understand that you want to join the circlejerk , everyone needs to feel loved and accepted but please read a little about the stuff you 're trying to write . 
  not protesters , jihadists . 
  they are n't that many of them either despite free buses , erdo\u011fan 's call , constant harassment with text messages and almost fanatical media support . 
  this is what these jihadist bastards did to pro-coup soldiers on bosphorus bridge . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elnaoy3a-ky ( nsfl ) these are conscripted soldiers who probably do n't even know wtf is going on . 
  they did n't fire upon people and they surrendered to police , leaving their weapons . 
  those `` protesters '' = isis . 
  no difference at all . 
  almost no one supports the coup on the secularist side but that does n't mean we have to support erdo\u011fan either . 
  being elected ( with a shit ton of fraud , but that 's another story ) does n't make erdo\u011fan 's rule democratic . 
  one non-democratic power fights with another , the sane thing here to do is to say fuck you to both of them , which is what secular people are doing . 
  islamist dictatorship is fighting with people who want a military dictatorship . 
  both sides are assholes , we do n't have to pick one . 
  this is valid , of course , if there really was a coup attempt . 
  there are signs pointing at an erdo\u011fan plot , considering how organized he was especially for the aftermath . 
  it 's still too early and blurry to tell for sure , but there are some strong arguments for this theory . 
  turkey has seen plenty of coups , both succesful and unsuccesful . 
  none of them seemed anything like this one . 
  yeah . 
  erdo\u011fan seems like as bad as it gets but the country has seen a few coups . 
  they always happen when everyone says `` yeah well it ca n't be worse '' and it 's always worse . 
  like thousands tortured and killed worse . 
  i 've been fighting erdo\u011fan regime since i was a teenager in high school and want him gone more than anyone , but not like that . 
  i hope the reports are false or we 're pretty fucked over here . 
  yeah i know my country is ruled by an islamist dictator . 
  i know how badly things are going for us , trust me . 
  and it 's still illegal here to do shit like that . 
  that was the point . 
  uk has done her fair share strenghtening islamists in the me too , btw . 
  does n't justify shit erdo\u011fan did on of course , but turkey is pretty far from being the only country with blood on her hands . 
  nah , italians never go to war without allies . 
  fighting alone makes it harder to switch sides . 
  in 2002 and 2008 this aggressive and stubborn playstyle worked . 
  it does n't have to work every time , but it is the character of the turkish team and players that are called to the national team have to play that way . 
  i do n't give a fuck we were eliminated , croatia and spain are both amazing teams . 
  the problem is everyone in the team were ok with those results . 
  in the czechia match even when we were leading 2-0 in the 80th minute they were doing everything they could to turn this around against almost impossible odds . 
  this is how turkish fans want their team to play , winning or losing is secondary . 
  in the spain match the spanish team got the lead it the 34 . minute and our team was like `` ok guys we lost lets start packing '' . 
  losing to spain is understandable , losing without fighting is not . 
  an event that big in the world we live in , it is almost certain that someone somewhere tried to turn it into a bloodbath . 
  the fact that no terror attacks happened in a giant organization spanning multiple cities like this means the french authorities did an amazing job . 
  also the compulsory hooligan fighting was sorted out quickly without much damage . 
  the tournament was a bit boring . 
  i do n't think attacking football and goals are the only things that make football beautiful . 
  i do enjoy watching solid , organized defensive teams too but where international football is going is far beyond that . 
  higher stakes made everyone play incredibly cowardly , especially after group stages . 
  watching two teams mutually park the bus is definitely not fun to watch . 
  watching my country play like absolute shit was also was n't that fun . 
  we were probably the most soulless team in the whole tournament . 
  fuckers played like someone forced them to get on the field . 
  it 's the fucking european tournament , if you 're incapable of at least enjoying playing there just fuck off and let players that actually want to play take your place . 
  i would be much happier if we joined the tournament with a full team of inexperienced youngsters and lost every match compared to those band of idiots who forgot to pack their soul coming to france . 
  on the plus side , iceland was great and not only because everyone likes an underdog . 
  their solid physical counterattack strategy introduced some much needed variation to the slow possession game almost everyone plays nowadays . 
  portugal finally winning something was also nice . 
  if they deserved to win this one is arguable ( if anyone deserved to win this one is arguable ) but they deserved to win something for the last few decades now . 
  also , though few in number , almost every single goal was amazing . 
  so thanks france , congrats portugal , and everyone needs to get their shit together for the world cup . 
  the whole situation seems like a compilation of legal loopholes and stretches used by islamists to prevent members of their community from leaving them and integrating to me . 
  it 's uk citizens ' business how to handle that , but i sure as hell do n't want anything like that in my country . 
  thanks for the info . 
  i hope you guys sort it out , this community within community with conflicting ideals shit can quickly become dangerous . 
  i was referring to that specific case in the video as an example . 
  the part i 'm talking about is a woman wanting a divorce because her husband rapes and beats her . 
  the `` judges '' advise her to get back together with the maniac .

  we are dealing with pkk for decades while no other country offered us their help . 
  and when it 's isis next-door the whole international community forms a coalition to fight them . 
  west has never thought about our safety and they never will . 
  that 's why we must fight our own battles . 
  we will fight pkk no matter what anyone else says . 
  we did enough to placate them . 
  we should have spoken out the moment they invaded iraq . 
  what about your other claims ? 
  like the lie you spread about turkey attacking first ? 
  got nothing to further your propaganda and lies ? 
  or are you really that stupid to believe that turkey broke the ceasefire ? 
  it 's an extremely easy thing to follow . 
  why does everyone claim to know everything about this conflict otherwise ? 
  it seems people know all about kurd-bombing trigger-happy turkey and secular , feminist , pro-lgbt kurds who are fighting to protect the american way ? 
  also , / r/syriancivilwar is a sub where every member does nothing but parrot their own propaganda . 
  do n't believe anything you read from there . 
  then why everyone claims we are bombing those us supports , trains and arms ? 
  it would n't be the first us-sponsored coup in turkey . 
  your friends in stalinist dictatorship of armenia ca n't play with our toys so tell them so !, 
  here is a tip to keep in mind while reading news . 
  when western media says `` turkey is bombing kurds '' they do n't mean ypg or all kurds together , they mean pkk . 
  but it sounds meaner when you say turkey is bombing a whole nation . 
  that 's how they put the spin they want to give . 
  exactly . 
  we did n't declare war on a country . 
  we fought terrorists that attacked our people . 
  we do n't need an excuse to do that nor permission from any other country . 
  did us need an excuse to attack al-qaeda ? 
  did us give a fuck what others said when they invaded iraq ? 
  if we were as bad as them , we would be using this as an excuse to invade syria . 
  others added enough to last you a lifetime . 
  there was n't anyone being a dick about it so here i am . 
   turkey should n't attack that faction without even discussing or telling the us . 
  also , it was pkk who broke the ceasefire by killing two cops in their sleep , not turkey . 
  so do n't blame us when we retaliate . 
  pkk should have focused on isil rather than rekindling their conflict with turkey , but of course we will get the blame when we do n't stand there gladly accepting headshots and bombings . 
  they know they got the support of westerners so they can get away with this shit easily . 
  pkk declared the ceasefire null and void and killed two cops in their sleep conveniently after isis made its ' first attack on turkey . 
  here , i added something . 
  it would take hours to bring you completely up to speed since you seem know nothing anyway . 
  you are too ignorant and misinformed to have a right to form opinions and and also you have no right to deplete our valuable oxygen on earth as well by existing . 
  you need to cease all your brain activities immediately . 
  this whole comment tree reminds me of grade school . 
   when you have a perfectly fine country already ? 
  not sure if serious ... 
  they can come here and fight for their lands then , because majority of the kurds here do n't . 
   those numbers are not people who died but people who were displaced after the azerbaijani dictatorship 's decision to attack karabakh when it exercised it 's internationally legally recognized right to self-determination . 
  same thing . 
  avoid sourcing dailysabah . 
  it 's a puppet of erdo\u011fan . 
  not that this article is wrong or anything . 
   700k azerbaijanis  400k armenian i guess azerbaijanis are supposed to have the sympathetic point of view here , since they died more than they killed . 
  that 's how it always works right ? 
   pkk and kurds ? 
  it 's pkk . 
  not kurds . 
  this is n't a whole nation we are fighting and turkish army has kurds in it too . 
  kurds also does n't have something like an agreement where they gather from time to time and say `` okay , us kurds will be doing this in turkey , this in syria , this in iraq '' . 
  they tend to differ amongst each other for some mysterious reason . 
  i 'm really tired of people talking about pkk like it 's what every kurd is in turkey . 
  do n't buy everything your media tells you . 
  talking about kurds like all of them are pkk members is exactly the attitude you would expect from a turkish ultra-nationalist . 
  maybe pkk should n't have rekindled their conflict with turkey by declaring the ceasefire null and void and killed two cops when they could have just focused on isil . 
  by the way saying `` pkk and kurds '' instead of just pkk ( which is actually what 's going on ) does n't make it sound like a just , freedom-fighting war . 
  they mostly speak german while visiting turkey . 
  did n't hear them speaking turkish much enough to see for myself . 
  that stuff happens a lot in southeastern turkey , which happens to be the region most german turks/kurds come from . 
  fuck your midwife . 
  funny thing is us turks from turkey complain about turks from germany being way too conservative . 
  hey !, 
  we will only stab you in the back when you turn your back to us . 
  ^ ^ 1453 ^ ^ best ^ ^ day ^ ^ of ^ ^ my ^ ^ life, 
  he was that people would call a `` benevolent dictator '' he tried to democratize the country at first . 
  but leading a revolution and the transition from monarchy to republic ca n't be done easily when you need to go through the bureaucracy of democracy . 
  also you ca n't deal with monarchists , pro-khalifa people ( people who wanted caliphate back ) and other reactionaries that way either . 
  atat\u00fcrk was offered the caliphate by some of his supporters but turned the title down . 
  from monarchy to one-party democracy was still good enough and paved the way for better . 
  i 've been to rome . 
  the moment when i crossed at red light with a big group of pedestrians all together made me feel at home . 
  europeans do this weird thing where they paint white lines on roads and cars stop if a pedestrian is crossing across those lines . 
  lost my shit when i saw it action in germany . 
  i mean we have those white lines too but i thought they were decorative or something . 
  it 's not easy to shift a blame like that to pkk without us finding it out . 
  i think it was dhkp-c , but we 'll see . 
  pkk would n't risk any fights with anyone else right now and isis would pick targets that would hurt turkey only if they attacked turkey . 
  this guy gets it . 
  us sponsoring a coup in turkey is the reason why we deal with jackasses like erdo\u011fan right now . 
  it 's unfortunate simple us consulate workers who had nothing to do with this died , but people in this region die for shit like this all the time . 
  and you 'll hear neckbeards saying `` we should give this region to this group , that region to this group , press the independence claims of this group , and kill this group '' like it 's nothing while innocent people from all sides die for this like it 's a paradox grand strategy game . 
  they ca n't show half the countries on a map that their government sponsored a coup in . 
  dhkp-c might be feeling funny again too . 
  you 'll know what fear is when you hop off that taxi . 
  dhkp-c most likely . 
  they use female militants and suicide bombers a lot . 
  they also hate us . 
  of course aircrafts will be hitting targets . 
  we are at war with pkk . 
  all lives matter . 
   i think what turkey does now is not exactly a defensive policy . 
  yeah , damn cops not allowing people to walk around with rpgs .

just do n't forget to say `` no homo tho '' at the end . 
  you 're right , i should 've expressed myself differently . 
  i admit that i 'm a bit emotional when it 's about terrorist groups in turkey , because we ( civilians ) have suffered a lot by terrorism ( not only pkk but in general ), 
  `` pkk hurt us more than isis did . '', 
  is a fact . 
  `` bringing myself to compare '' sounds more subjective , because the guy above me sounded like that . 
  ca n't answer it , sorry . 
  it 's a very controversial subject , and i believe i do n't have enough knowledge for now . 
  i do n't think turkey is guilty when pkk is bombing and killing civilians in middle east and big cities such as istanbul and ankara . 
  it 's just not between army of turkey and guerilla ( pkk ) . 
  there is no need to compare terrorist organisations . 
  turkey has been dealing with pkk for long years , iirc at least thirty . 
  at this point i ca n't bring myself to compare . 
  pkk hurt us more than isis did . 
  many turks that do n't support erdogan know pkk is a terrorist organisation . 
  he reminds me of `` jester '' from town of salem . 
  please do n't insult kebabs . 
  kebab is awesome , erdo\u011fan is not . 
   they also have a romanticised version of turkey in their heads precisely because they have never lived there . 
  they go there for like a month in the summer as a kid each year and they think that 's what it 's like to live there . 
  that 's 100 % right , i know many german-turks and they adore turkey/istanbul , they always talk about how much they missed istanbul , but they 've never lived in the country for more than 4 weeks ( holiday ) . 
  and most of european-turks support erdo\u011fan and believe that turkey is strong thanks to him . 
  do they think turkey has the same standards as germany/nl ? 
  probably . 
  yet they never think of moving out of europe . 
  ofc we tried , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gezi_park_protests they do n't listen . 
  they 're brainwashed . 
  yes , i 'm not even exaggerating it . 
  a considerable amount of voters think like that . 
  unfortunately , yes . 
  erdo\u011fan supporters think usa and europe are scared of turkey 's might . 
  some of them vote for him out of fear . 
  istanbul 's population is almost 15m tho, 
  i would always take roman/byzantine empire over ottoman anyway, 
  i 'm okay with civ references here . 
  awesome game . 
  there are overly sensitive people in the world ( especially when it 's about skin colour ) so i assume they thought you 're one of them, 
  it 's like rednecks of america, 
  at this point i 'm not even surprised anymore . 
   why are you turks and arabs in europe when you do not respect country you live in . 
  money , better healthcare/education , civilized people . 
  even though they always think turkey is better than germany/nl . 
  turks in europe are bigoted , two-faced and narrow minded people . 
  i believe many ottoman leaders would feel ashamed of erdo\u011fan . 
  unlike erdo\u011fan and his ministers , some ottoman leaders were educated and open-minded in their respective eras . 
  ( note : not a fan of ottoman empire here ), 
  there will be a referendum in april , we 're going to decide if we want to give more power to erdo\u011fan to become a `` stronger country '' , or not ( a man should n't hold too much power ) . 
  akp wanted to have a rally in nl/germany because there are a lot of european-turks living there , and they have right to vote . 
  netherlands did n't want that , at least not in their public areas . 
  now erdo\u011fan is playing the victim and says `` europe is fascist !, 
  they hate us !, 
  they 're jealous/afraid of our power !!!! '', 
  my mind went ????? 
  at the headline . 
  cringefest indeed, 
   his plan b is probably terror attacks and showing himself as the beacon of stability , but people see through that too . 
  this have n't happened in major cities since they announced referendum , latest one was in be\u015fikta\u015f . 
  but i 'm scared too . 
  i 'm going to vote #no , but what if erdo\u011fan starts bombing our cities again ? 
  mods , please ban this guy . 
   redditor for 37 minutes lol, 
  i thought the same thing . 
  remember when k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu said he wo n't oppose referendum ? 
  how he believes in democracy , our people and their free will ? 
  otherwise erdo\u011fan would say `` oh opposition ( chp ) is against democratic ways !, 
  they 're scared of referendum !, 
  i thought they were thinking of willem van oranje but do those people even know who that is ? 
  i agree with you . 
  i also do n't want turkish citizens living in other countries in their whole lives having right to vote . 
  some european turks have never lived there , but they can vote ? 
  as a turk , i ca n't stand having turks in my team either , i feel you . 
  i often hid my nationality and just speak english instead . 
  i had no idea that kilicdaroglu supported cavusoglu . 
  what the actual fuck , seriously . 
  well , eurovision is n't a normal song contest, 
  ballads vs freak shows not that i complain, 
  my favourites were moldova , montenegro , greece , azerbaijan and portugal today . 
  sad that montenegro could n't make it :(, 
  australia still thinks eurovision is a song contest . 
  but it is n't, 
  portugal was so sweet , reminded me of disney, 
  never voted for akp in my life . 
  so it means i have no right to criticise them ? 
  / u/prigby 's post was about ataturk 's reforms and what he did for republic of turkey , not armenian genocide . 
  idk why mods are n't doing something about this . 
  it 's becoming pretty boring . 
  i 'll take a look at it in detail tomorrow . 
  huh ? 
  that 's entirely a different issue , it involves criminal law . 
  on these shows you 're on screen by your consent , and willing to meet your future spouses and marry them by your consent again . 
  i shared the same thought first , but then i realised that erdogan can ban any kind of show he wants ( he already did in past ) just because it 's `` immoral '' , `` against traditional & religious values '' etc. 
  i do n't like this kind of shows , but this is wrong . 
  he 'll continue banning anything he does n't like seeing on tvs . 
  i heard this is false , but it 's too late here atm and i 'm going to look for sources tomorrow . 
  it 's annoying when greeks randomly attack you on the internet even if it 's irrelevant to the topic . 
  this is like an irish attacking every british they see on this sub . 
  if the thread is about turkey-greece history then it 's ok . edit : i do n't have anything against greek people . 
  i like their culture , history and people . 
  however ive never had a friendly or neutral conversation between a greek on the internet , because of their behaviour . 
  try zenmate and hola unblocker,

  we are eurosceptic . 
  he let them enter state and supported unconditionally . 
  it was his fault . 
  also erdogan did some other good things . 
  he improved health care , housing ( toki is although corrupt successful institution ) , infrastructure , national arms industry etc. 
  obviously they do in syria . 
   they are 80 % of the sovjet though [ far from it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j0eroln.jpg ), 
  there are rumours erdogan wants to change strategy in syria and cooperate with russia and iran . 
  you are comparing apples and oranges . 
  just read two countries constitutions and see the difference . 
  even most progressive politicians are full blown islamists in iran while islamist parties are literally illegal here . 
  erdogan is our putin , not khomeini . 
  iranians are religious freaks . 
  iran is isolated because it is hostile towards israel , us 's 51st state . 
  erdogan is pragmatic . 
  he may be an authoritarian asshole but he is n't stupid . 
  i know . 
  i was just saying we have another option , although inferior one . 
  this may change in few decades but western alliance is better option than china/russia alliance for now . 
   however , this still leaves erdogan 's pro-islamist/jihadist foreign policy . 
  turkey 's foreign policy is imperialist , not islamist . 
  turkey is seeking influence in mena and does n't care who brings it . 
   since russia is a far stronger/more important power . 
  and now you are overestimating russia . 
  russia is n't soviets . 
  no but we have options . 
  nato is n't a must . 
  how ? 
  sink their boats , shoot them on border ? 
  they are civilian asylum seekers , women , children , not some invading foreign army . 
  you ca n't stop them . 
  that 's why you are sucking turkey 's dick . 
   i doubt how well turkey would find itself without the west . 
  you are underestimating turkey 's geopolitical importance . 
  eastern alliance will welcome turkey with open arms . 
  what will you do ? 
  block eu membership negotiations ? 
  you already do that . 
  sanction turkey ? 
  for what reason , because you do n't want asylum seekers who are coming from war-torn country . 
  less military cooperation ? 
  that 's what us is for . 
  turkey does that since forever and it [ works ] ( http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/interactive/2014/09/world/isis-explained/media/jihadi02.jpg ) . 
  turkey is n't blackmailing eu . 
  eu wants to bribe turkey and erdogan is ok with that . 
  the problem is that eu is cheap and untrustworthy as always . 
  trust the one who lives in turkey . 
  how highly of you !, 
  you let those untermensch use their civil rights . 
  what is your next generous gift to them ? 
  not genociding them . 
   we in germany , however , do consistently ban demonstrations that are known beforehand to escalate into violence . 
  we do that here too and eu keeps lecturing us about democracy , human rights because of that . 
  talk about hypocrisy !, 
  it was turkey 's fault . 
  fighting a proxy war with russia in syria is a mistake . 
  we are overplaying our hand . 
  also turkey should maintain good relations with eastern alliance . 
  we may end up leaving western one if it goes like this . 
  comparing turkey to afghanistan and malaysia is ridiculous . 
  turkey has very different history , political environment , internal dynamics and most importantly different [ approach to religion ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/gsi2-chp1-3.png ) . 
  and you europeans are biggest ignorant retards . 
  you do n't know shit about turkey and still think you know everything . 
  worse than americans , at least they know they are ignorant . 
  turkey is a secular country . 
  islamism is n't an issue in turkey . 
  only around 10 % of population wants islamic regime here . 
  you can find more fascist extremists in any european country . 
  just look at this sub . 
  btw i am not even muslim let alone islamist . 
  i do n't care what you xenophobic fucks want . 
  i meant it is n't not big deal to get schengen visa for turks . 
  it is easy to get visa unless you are unemployed or something . 
  eu countries , especially touristic ones , rarely reject visa application of turks . 
  turkey can decide who is guilty or not by itself but turkey and us will form a commision for deportation of gulen and we will present evidence we have to that commision . 
  some military officers committed suicide because of them . 
  eye for an eye !, 
  i hope they do . 
  letting them go europe is only way to get rid of syrians . 
  syrian civil war will not end soon . 
  that stupid visa-free deal is n't that important . 
  schengen visa is pretty easy to get . 
  i do n't understand why it is big deal . 
  you never call them german even when they call themselves german . 
  you know this is true . 
  freedom of assembly , freedom of expression . 
  they can show support whoever they want . 
  even `` democrat '' europeans do n't seem to get that 's a basic right in a liberal democracy . 
  `` civil liberties are for us , not for those muslims . '', 
  mass deportation of a religious group is ethnic cleansing , crime against humanity according to un . 
  you europeans never change . 
  staying at home is free . 
  they can stay at home since sweden is such a great country . 
  all that sophisticated cuisine , good weather , rich history , warm ( definitely not arrogant and racist ) people !, 
  believe or not despite it 's problems turkey is pretty good country to live in if you have some money . 
  i do n't see anybody going vacation to nordic countries but turkey gets 40 million tourists every year . 
  they are there for money , money . 
  for the same reason you suck russia 's dick . 
  eu will give you shitest deal possible to make bad example out of you . 
  otherwise more countries will try to leave eu .

  actually it 's just the opposite . 
  that religious part is responsible for taking everyone who hop the border in the name of `` muslim brotherhood . '', 
   war does not seem to be ending in 5-10 years at least , which means a generation at least . 
  point still stands . 
  most of actors ( i mean countries , not proxies in syria ) in this war want to end it asap to prevent more refugee influx . 
   this does not matters on the personal level . 
  this does matter , that 's why there 's difference between a refugee and immigrant . 
  one is `` came '' here , other is `` fled '' . 
   why not ? 
  what you think new generation raised in turkey or ones that settled in turkey would want ? 
  the point is sending them back before * generations * . 
  otherwise it will be too late . 
   even the turks in cyprus do n't want to leave even they 're not wealthy . 
  because they 're voluntarily have been sent there to ** turkify ** , they did n't escape from some violence in turkey . 
   and still , turkey is a better choice than syria . 
  it is . 
  but nobody can live in a place where people oppose him . 
   well , not actually ; it 's going to be the same with the turkish guest workers in germany with or without the akp . 
  they 're a large minority even know and it 's going to be impossible to deport them after 5-6 years against their wills . 
  what you 're going to do if 3-4 million people who settled down for more than 5 or maybe 8-10 years do n't want to leave ? 
  or their hundreds of thousand children who will born and/or raised in turkey ? 
  turkish guest workers wanted to stay in germany and resisted for it . 
  syrian refugees do n't want to stay in turkey . 
  turks do n't want them eather . 
  many of syrians want to go to europe and some of them want to go back to their country . 
  you 're comparing apples and grapes . 
  things you are saying that mainly based on ruling party . 
  if you think that akp will stay forever , your statements are true . 
  but they wo n't . 
  no , it 's impossible to keep them here when war is over . 
  especially when you consider the public opposition . 
  except we have a chance to send them back when war is over , european countries do n't have . 
  getting visa is cancerous , that 's why . 
  why did you write exactly what i wrote ? 
  poll : http://www.edam.org.tr/en/file?id=1152 people in general do n't like them and want to send them back to their countries . 
  most of them live on streets , try to make money via begging . 
  they do n't want to stay in refugee camps and even if they want , there 's no capacity for all of them . 
  the second reason is they work illegally and decrease the wage so employers are in favour of syrian workers instead of turkish . 
  why would someone wants turkish workers who will get min 1000tl while syrian workers who work for ** any ** cost ? 
  third reason is culture . 
  the westerners love to think that if you border some country and share the same religion , you 're automatically share the same culture . 
  it 's wrong as hell . 
  this is middle east where you can find lots of opposite cultures within a country . 
  firstly the perception of islam is very different in countries . 
  you ca n't compare turkish , azeri etc. 
  islam to syrian one . 
  regardless who they are , poor or wealthy , they seem backwards in many turks point of view . 
   visa relaxation for turks that would be enough for me and many turks . 
  pre-info : our old apartment was build 35 years ago and not seem resistant to possible big earthquake . 
  it was one of reasons why we moved to a new flat . 
  our new appartment built in mid-2014 , has lots of columns and ( according to district municipality ) its location is safe . 
   are there education and preparation programmes in place to keep the damage small ? 
  there is n't . 
  people just aware of the risk but they do n't know what they should do during earthquake and where they should go after it . 
  i think most of people unconsciously go to coastal areas of the city to feel safe as they did in 1999 . 
  addition : i forgot that there 's a gentrification programme going on . 
  they simply evacuate a neighbourhood , demolish all that buildings in it and build new ones . 
  what residents get depends on how valuable their old flats are . 
  for example if you have 4 +1 200m2 flat , you get a flat that either has equal features or coequal features . 
  i mean they give you 2 2 +1 flats instead of 4 +1 . 
  the main point of gentrification is the resistance to possible big earthquake . 
   are you insured ? 
  yes , we are . 
  earthquake insurance is compulsory in turkey and you have to renew it every year . 
  i 'm afraid of earthquakes and seems like it 's the biggest taboo among istanbulites . 
  nobody dare to talk about possible big earthquake ( 7.0 + richter ) which predicted to happen in 30 years . 
  people even ca n't dare to talk about 1999 earthquake because of all that tragedy . 
  r/turkey have lots of , tons of , shittons of nationalists . 
  you can easily be accused of being pkk supporter or something and that accusation get lots of upvotes . 
   i 'm guessing most of these are named after either the 2nd prez of turkey ( 1st after ataturk ) or the battles . 
  actually both . 
  actually i do n't know and never thought why we give mainly flower names to our streets . 
  considering the only flower that islam cares/mentions about is rose , it 's most likely a cultural thing . 
  i think flower names are the easiest to give . 
  there wo n't be any controversy about them and hell , how can someone dislike flowers ? 
  so what if i do n't want people who beg in the streets , disturb and rob locals , commit crime ? 
  what if i just want to learn how many of these `` refugees '' are really refugees ? 
  ** top 10 ** * atat\u00fcrk : 3.618 * republic : 3.008 * conqueror ( mehmed ii ) : 1.403 * rose : 1.331 * school : 1.212 * clove : 1.211 * tulips : 1.200 * violet : 1.197 * \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc : 1.089 * liberty : 1.075 [ source ] ( http://www.nvi.gov.tr/files/file/istatistikler/uavt/pdf/csbm%20\u0130s\u0130mler\u0130.pdf ), 
  sorry but nothing can be peaceful in middle east . 
  turkey 's government does n't play a two-faced role because there 's no such thing as turkish government since june 7th . 
  because following turkish politics in its language is entertaining . 
  hillary is pro war and actually wants to boots on ground to overthrow assad government . 
  basically she wants to add iraq war 2.0 on whole that mess in syria that 's called civil war . 
  not to mention all things she has done during arab spring . 
  that does n't mean trump is angel , i just do n't want hillary . 
  i hope hillary wo n't be elected . 
  the middle east does n't need another bush . 
  majority of the nation from every political views have some disgust towards western countries . 
  especially towards britain because of historical reasons , current middle east problems and generally we like to live in past . 
  erdo knows it , use it as a political tool when religion card is not that effective . 
  not saying this is good or bad , i just said what it is . 
  erdo would 've declared sharia which he would be supreme leader if 75 % backed him . 
  so pkk and isis claimed responsibility of the same bombing , wow . 
  a journey from illiberal democracy to tyranny of the majority i 'd say . 
  turkey has always been a regional power . 
  the question is how this power going to be used . 
  he wo n't attack chp before he makes mhp voterbase split up ( hence they are below the threshold ) and hdp got closed . 
  eliminating small threats first and the big one later basically . 
  but i agree that attacking chp means automatically civil war . 
  the founding party of the republic which is secular stronghold and got 1/4 of votes we 're talking about here .

  gender segregation and banning of alcohol is high on his list of things to do . 
  well i hope such a day comes soon so we can put this terrible event behind us . 
  well to be fair there are a total of 3 turks in this thread . 
  well it 's 4 now . 
  in any case i am not denying it . 
  however this whole topic is * never * discussed in turkey . 
  people really are in denial by default . 
  i can never really properly discuss it with anyone without nationalism being shoved in my face . 
  i am sorry that armenians had to go through this event . 
  wars are always devastating and there were a lot of village raiding and general disturbance by the armenian `` gangs '' . 
  but nothing excuses a genocide . 
  it seems like turkey will never accept this due to it 's pride and other political reasons . 
  it 's kind of an unsolvable problem . 
  constitutional court once denied his request for banning youtube and twitter . 
  he literally said that he will do it anyways on live tv during a rally and people cheered for him . 
  ( and he did ban them for the duration of the last elections propaganda ) he sees himself above the law . 
  his deputy also said on live tv that they were in fact not having equal propaganda compared to other parties . 
  because he was the prime minister of course he would have more posters , commercials and coverage . 
  ( funded by tax payers of course ), 
  they are not voting with their experience or logic , they are voting with their religion . 
  it 's inevitable i am afraid . 
  his intentions are very clear . 
  he is going to improve the powers of his position significantly . 
  with half the country following him blindly there is no hope at sight . 
  there are many women voting for him as well as well as many young people . 
  when the majority of the country approves of his actions no one can challenge those actions even if they are clearly wrong , against democracy and secularism . 
  two ideals that helped form and improve this country after a devastating war . 
  it 's heartbreaking to witness these events :(, 
  [ turkey ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6lqkyf0.jpg ) it 's a mall called sapphire . 
  238 meters tall . 
  unfortunately no . 
  he has many young followers as well as old ones . 
  i personally can not comprehend the state of mind that their young supporters have . 
  i myself am 19 years old and i find it ridiculous that they banned twitter and youtube right before the election because `` they were spreading lies '' . 
  lies that includes a voice recording between the pm and his son regarding a stack of cash that needs to be hidden . 
  apparently there are young people that consider this okay . 
  nation wise education definitely needs improvement . 
  but uneducated people are basically akp 's source of power . 
  they present themselves as the guardians of religion . 
  everyone else are `` others '' . 
  frankly the pm shows many traits of a fascist dictator . 
  sadly he can be considered charismatic as a politician and is capable of giving strong speeches . 
  even when he clearly cherry picks his arguments and straight up twist the truth , nobody cares . 
  he is a strong `` world leader '' among his followers eyes and people accept anything he says . 
  every election many regions that akp might lose , faces troubles with electricity going out , votes going missing or turning up in dumpsters , revotes in locations which end up changing positively for them . 
  propaganda is funded from government funds ( funds that are created by tax payers to improve the country ) and they distribute things like coal electronic devices in exchange of promises of votes . 
  whenever there is a akp rally subway stations and taxis work for free to the meeting location . 
  spot on observation . 
  turk here and i am watching as the country slowly goes to shit as the governing party and the pm uses religion to gather votes and just build a monarchy for themselves under the disguise of democracy . 
  the pm is almost guarenteed to be elected president in the very soon to happen elections and he has been improving the powers of the title of president for years now . 
  what proper chance this country has , of becoming a part of eu and the western society is about to diminish because of the ambitions of an arrogant man . 
  such a shame , especially after the hard work people put into this country in 20th century . 
  i think chp supporters are a mixture of nationalists and leftists . 
  there is also kemalism in there too . 
  i did n't want to say nationalists because it could be misunderstood as mhp supporters . 
  you are right in that they have n't had sole power for a while now but they were obviously part of coalitions . 
  i 've never said anything close to erdogan being innocent and yet you went onto list his illegal and manipulative activities . 
  do you think erdogan brainwashed his millions of supporters ? 
  those people support erdogan without a second thought because they felt oppressed by the elitists and leftists . 
  erdogan has the power he has today because leftist parties of turkey have failed to relate to the very large conservative uneducated part of turkey . 
  i 'm coming from a family that is a huge chp supporter , i 've only voted for chp in my life , i will only vote for chp for the foreseeable future but it is naive to think that they are perfect . 
  all i am trying to achieve is constructive criticism for the elitist and leftist side of turkey . 
  i found the article mostly accurate . 
  it has the very important quality , that is not perceiving everything as black and white . 
  a stance i try to take on every political discussion . 
  a stance i find people at / r/turkey seems to have lost due to recent events . 
  as of this moment there is literally nowhere to discuss turkish politics without blaming everything on erdogan , pkk , hdp or a combination of the three . 
  i 've lost faith for open minded genuine discussion some time ago . 
  all there is left is to observe and worry about the future of the country ... 
   show the middle finger to eu lol . 
  i think you are still living in 16th century mate . 
  what was the standard used for other years in the graph though ? 
  maybe you can reach 800k by keeping the conditions very broad but would it be a fare comparison with previous years at that point ? 
  seems like 800k projection is a bit exaggerated . 
  is n't the number for 2015 a projection ? 
  what is the number until august i wonder ? 
  but it 'd be naive to assume everything is going as intended and this certainly seems like an issue . 
  well after a certain amount of time ct 's and t 's switches side right ? 
  immigration at work , i tell you !, 
  i do consider myself european . 
  culturally i feel like a mix of both worlds but i 'm not a religious person . 
  i 'd love us to join eu but i do n't see it happening anytime soon . 
  i like european values like the importance given to science and importance given to social care . 
  i think cyprus invasion was initially justified but it no longer is . 
  north cypriots seem to no longer want turkey involved but if and when turkey does leave they will have some big issues regarding their economy . 
  i visited there this summer and cyprus looks like any other eu nation but northern cyprus looked underdeveloped in comparison . 
  i dislike erdogan heavily , he was the worst thing to happen to turkey in a long time . 
  but similar events would have happened without him , just with someone else in charge . 
  it 's more about the underdeveloped and uneducated part of the nation more so than erdogan himself . 
  it would take some progressive policies to fix these issues which will never happen under parties supported by the same uneducated side that would benefit the most from it . 
  i do n't see a kurdistan that includes lands from turkey . 
  they do n't have the military or political power to enforce it and even most kurds living in the claimed lands of kurdistan seems to be more than happy to stay in turkey . 
  a lot of western taxes pay for expenses at the east . 
  additionally i do believe armenian genocide happened to a degree but i think it is extremely exaggerated in it 's claims how it was planned and went down . 
  it 's been subjected to 100 years of single sided narrative and is probably in a unsolvable state at this point . 
  turkey would never admit to the version currently being presented by the armenian side and armenian side wo n't back down neither . 
  so in my opinion the issue is unsolvable . 
   a sort of revenge against the kurdish political party entering the turkish parliament making his own political party lose it 's majority . 
  this part is mostly true . 
  i would n't call it revenge but it is certainly a strategy for erdogan .

  erdo\u011fan ca n't open the ` faili me\u00e7hul ' cases , he would be buried under them . 
  people collect results and compare them to the board of elections . 
  turkey 's left wing is very conscious about elections . 
  the way to do it without making it obvious as fuck was to let unstamped votes be used in the ballots and later declare them valid because people watching the elections would n't account for those , adding frauded ballots to the box with them ( this was possible since the votes in question were unstamped anyway ) . 
  also they did a lot of shady shit in kurdish cities in which citizens were n't allowed to watch voting areas because terror etc. 
  they managed to turn 2-3 % to their side with fraud and that was enough in a referandum that narrow . 
  edit : yeah sure downvote bots are indeed very useful when you do n't have anything to say you poor \u00e7omars . 
  people sentimentally attack ottoman history because it 's the historical boogeyman of the west , so sometimes you have to explain that they were just a regular multiethnic empire that was different , but not objectively better or worse than its european contemporaries . 
  that 's not defending it . 
  turkey is not the continuation of the ottomans , but the last nation state to gain her independence from the empire like other balkan and middle eastern nations . 
  overwhelming majority of secular turks are proud to be citizens of the nation that has destroyed the old and long rotten empire and have no nostalgia for it . 
  they can usually look at its history more objectively than the average european though . 
  not even gon na explain how democracy is supposed to work because you 're completely wrong and what you understand as `` democracy '' is elected majority dictatorship , the thing is that erdo\u011fan `` won '' by voter fraud as documented by lots of respectable local and international researchers . 
  the other half is completely free to live as they like . 
  their demands are that the other opposing half comply to their lifestyle too . 
  that 's not a valid demand in any democracy , no matter how many people want it . 
  not as much as hdp as their mps are still out , but lots of pro chp journalists intellectuals etc. 
  are in jail . 
  nah , just different cliques . 
  nothing `` modern '' about their doctrine . 
  they pretend to be tolerant multiculturalists now that they have lost their power , but so did erdo\u011fan before he took power . 
  the threat is that they hold lots of high positions in the state organization . 
  akp does n't have enough competent cadres to employ as generals , judges , bureucrats etc. 
  so they allied gulen . 
  the cultish structure of the gulenist movement lets them train their initiates however they want . 
  he 's an islamist so do n't bother . 
  he 'd much rather go to hell than a library . 
  he supported erdo\u011fan in turkey for years so yeah , he 's a piece of shit . 
  just that though , not a mastermind puppeteer . 
  the area is n't a part of israel either . 
  uk was in on it too and i do n't remember germany defending libyan or syrian sovereignity either . 
  when the french , germans and brits fuck up whole europe suffers . 
  that 's not a modern thing , it has always been like that . 
  moderate alcohol consumption is n't really unhealthy . 
  alcoholism is . 
  eating meat is healthy but eating 5 steaks a day will fuck you up in some way too . 
  what fucks people up is n't alcohol but addiction in general . 
  people bring up the madman theory often nowadays , i think it 's important to remember that it failed for nixon . 
  no anatolian community was ever racially pure anyway . 
  before they were turkified by ottomans , they were hellenized native anatolians ( hittites , phrygians etc. ), 
  both the romans , eastern romans and ottomans were large multicultural empires with lots of in-empire migration . 
  being a racist in this geography is pretty dumb . 
  nobody knows what the hell they are and most will never know since their ancestors started interacting with foreign cultures before they could even write . 
  yeah he cares so much about our soldiers ' lives he wants to send them to syria and qatar , you know , for vacation and stuff . 
  spare me the bs . 
  this cheap propaganda trick by this lying stealing murdering bastard should be ridiculed . 
  this is inspired by ottoman architecture which is a refinement of byzantine and other levantine styles with a bit of seleucid turkic influence . 
  arabian architecture is pretty different regarding mosques . 
  communists have never been backwards regarding gender roles where i live . 
  not right now . 
  they support different terrorists . 
  britain wanted to leave it to the ottomans actually , after securing enough bases in the bosphorus of course . 
  britain was actually the only major power to keep fighting to some degree , supplying the greeks and not letting the turkish army enter the bosphorus region . 
  the french left after the first signs of resistance while italians feeling betrayed by the treaty left without firing a single shot . 
  they even left their weapons behind for the militias as a fuck you to the british . 
  after bleeding so much for their own countries europeans did n't really want to fight another war for middle eastern colonies . 
  make byzantion pagan again !, 
  the point is that legality does n't matter , it was legitimate . 
  the disputed part was about the majority in the city center of smyrna only , which had the biggest greek population in anatolia . 
  the territory given to greece in sevres as a whole was pretty clearly turkish overall . 
  greece never denied this either . 
  by that logic every single war of independence is illegal . 
  greek war of independence was illegal too , ottoman empire was the legal owner of greece . 
  when locals do n't want to be ruled by a certain administration , it matters very little who it legally belongs to , usually . 
  turkish army liberated the aegean coast of anatolia which had a clear turkish majority ( as stated in wilson report ) . 
  this was n't an offensive war by any sense of the word , the greek army was the invading army in anatolia taking advantage of a war they did n't even join . 
  but the point is that it was n't necessary to win the war . 
  it was textbook terror bombing , punishment extracted on civilians . 
  there was no strategic importance of leveling the entire city . 
  the british fought bravely in wwii and i have a huge amount of respect for your nation for that , but even just wars have war crimes . 
  dresden was one . 
  i do n't think an apology is needed but britain needs to accept that it was wrong and should n't be repeated under any circumstance again . 
  `` brits are guilty '' \u2260 `` brits are as guilty as the nazis '', 
  it 's a pretty big day for the turkish left because of the mayday massacre in 77 . 
  depending on the political conjuncture , left wing parties and unions either try to go to taksim and clash with the police ( taksim has historical importance for the left because of 77 and cobtemporary importance because of gezi . 
  akp banned it for protests ) or hold a big demonstration somewhere else . 
  this year it was in bak\u0131rk\u00f6y . 
  it was pretty big , about 50.000 if i had to guess . 
  some small parties also tried to go to taksim . 
  did n't end well . 
  i do n't exactly go out of my way to mess with him . 
  he stopped funding shit in turkey anyway , the organizations he founded are now funded by qatar and saudis mostly . 
  he 's just an asshole who had a part in ruining my country ( and not as small as you think , open society foundation literally rained money to turkey in 2000 's ) and i think i 'm allowed to hate him for that . 
  i do n't really care about alt right , they are a classic european reactionary group this time with internet . 
  yeah they are morons , but just because they hate somebody does n't mean that person is a saint . 
  no , islamists did . 
  they just helped . 
  as i said , i do n't think soros is an evil mastermind behind everything that 's bad in the world like alt right . 
  he 's just an asshole who created , funded and supported various pro-islamist pro-akp ngo 's in the `` anti authoritarian '' disguise . 
  they kept ignoring all the dictatorial shit erdo\u011fan did and blamed everything on kemalists . 
  now that they do n't need to mask their intentions they closed the ngo 's and joined akp directly . 
  the ones who actually believed the democratic islamism bs refused to do so , and most of those are either in jail or exile . 
  such is the irony of `` democratic '' dictatorships . 
  the difference is that `` communist state '' by itself is an oxymoron . 
  a capitalist state can exist , and they do exist . 
  communist society is supposed to be completely classless ( socialist state is n't btw. , it just should be aspiring to be classless ) and that also invalidates the state organization in marxist understanding , so also stateless . 
  a communist world as envisioned in marxist theory would n't hav a state organization in the way we have it today . 
  states can be socialist , aspiring to a communist world but can not be communist . 
  no country ever claimed to be a communist state to my knowledge , if they did they were following another communist theory not by marx . 
  i 'm as left wing as they come and i hate the bastard with a passion .

  `` they called me ` the cassandra ''' said mr. giannitsis of the headlines during his unpopular push for reforming the pension system . 
  cassandra , in the greek myth , was a clairvoyant doomed to always be right , but never believed . 
  she went crazy . 
  if it was put to the european tax payers greece would n't have many sympathizers . 
  until the first guy arranges a mugging . 
  it 's not going to stop them . 
  good to see they finally released euclid from [ shawshank ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article9706513.ece/binary/original/the-shawshank-redemption.jpg ), 
  hey now . 
   the dutch prime minister , mark rutte , warned athens that if it does not accept the creditors ' reform demands `` it is over '' . 
  `` did greeks really think that if they voted no , we would come and ask : ` how else would you like it ? ''' he said same question i was asking myself . 
  schaeuble is stroking it as we speak, 
  no guts no glory . 
  did i really have to put '' / s '' at the end ? 
   what 's the motive ? 
  just like how the turkish opposition gives credit to the akp for the economic developments / s. 
  greek politicians and the platforms on which they were elected seem to be aliens placed clandestinely in greece without the knowledge of the people . 
  greece is beating both of you . 
  life itself is a bazaar . 
  turkey took in 2 million syrian refugees . 
  during the kobani crisis turkey took in 200,000 kurds . 
  that shows the percentage e.g. 
  if the armenian population of armenia is 95 % with a total of 3 million what 's the percentage of armenian diaspora in the rest of the world with a total of 11 million and which total is greater ? 
  those statistics would highlight armenia as red and the rest of the world as a very light pink . 
  need to see the face, 
  think of this scenario . 
  south east of turkey is turned into a kurdistan however the majority of the kurds live in the western and central part of turkey and have not moved to the new kurdistan . 
  20 years down the line , these kurds just like the previous kurds say they want an autonomous region where kurds are a majority in istanbul or in central turkey and if turkey does n't grant these autonomous regions or `` cantons '' then they will start terrorism again against turkey and this time they have an independent kurdistan which will back them up with money and weapons . 
  why would turks accept this ? 
  if kurds want a separate homeland it 's a one time deal , separation and no more dealing with kurdish terrorism and independence demands and this way everyone will be happy . 
  [ austerity has n't hit the greek hanky panky underwear market yet ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tj4to7i.png ), 
  they wo n't go . 
  even the kurds who say they support the pkk would refuse to live under their control . 
  they want turkey to be split with a kurdistan in the south east and watch it from a distance while they kick it in istanbul . 
  if you guys pay attention many of the kurds actually have turkish names , speak fluent turkish and do n't speak kurdish at all . 
  the pkk supporting mayor of the biggest kurdish majority city in turkey ( diyarbakir ) admitted his kids do n't speak kurdish to him , only turkish . 
  also let me add that many ministers , many mps from all parties , many singers , actors , businessmen are kurdish . 
  there 's no discrimination . 
  it 's a really odd situation . 
  turks have had enough though , many would welcome a separation if it would mean the end of terrorism and end of seeing terrorist supporters in the parliament ( the other day they refused to sing the national anthem at the swearing in ceremony ) . 
  many isis members are kurdish themselves . 
  they say that now because they ca n't afford to go fully independent as they lack the resources . 
  `` autonomy '' just means `` i 'm biding my time until i get my shit together '' . 
  the problem is the majority of the kurds now live in the western part of turkey and not the traditional south east . 
  the only way the secession would work would be to have all the kurds move to the south east and then give them the south east to create their own country , this idea would be supported by a lot of turks . 
   half a month ago a man screaming allahu akbar in istanbul tried to burn down a church . 
  i submitted it to / r/europe [ 1 ] and it was delisted by everyone 's favourite francophone as `` random local news '' . 
  the mods were right . 
  he was a mental health patient who burnt the door of a church . 
  it 's great , let the people decide and own the responsibility . 
  if the venetians were n't actually bombing the parthenon no gunpowder would be lit now would it .

  two years you say, 
  [ `` why ca n't greeks live like romanians ? 
  why do they need so much money ? 
  realization is slowly creeping in . 
  it might already be too late though . 
  application itself was an advancement of the science . 
  it was n't an extension of a proven technology . 
  if a country now develops a combustion engine it 's not an advancement of the science since we know all about it , it 's just an engineering and manufacturing challenge but if a country develops a warp drive that would be advancement of the science itself . 
  so the manhattan project did n't contribute to the science you say . 
  innovation can be a nice little side benefit . 
  [ it 's pretty accurate at its core ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u08xlaz.png ), 
  and humble too . 
  hey every dollar counts . 
  bingo , that worked . 
  thanks . 
  yeah why is mine missing the left arm ? 
  i copied your one and it 's still missing it . 
  turkish economy grew for 22 consecutive quarters . 
  we privatized a lot to pay off the imf debt so that we would n't pay more interest on it . 
  you guys do n't want to privatize either and europeans wo n't give us any free money so no deal sorry . 
  then you 'll ask us to pay your debts . 
  with all these news pieces i think europe is preparing the ground work for this \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af after greece defaults . 
   yeah , because i 'm sure the pkk lined up all those 40,000 people and put a bullet in each and every one of them . 
  the turkish army in its 30 years of counter-insurgency never once killed a single human being . 
  yeah because the al qaeda lined up all its victims and put a bullet in each and every one of them . 
  the us army in its 70 year middle east meddling never once killed a single human being . 
   thanks for taking war refugees from a city that was less than a kilometre from your border , i guess ? 
  nice sarcasm while europe cries about every north african immigrant that washes up on its shores from across the pond . 
   do n't get me wrong , the refugee efforts of the neighbouring countries in syria are admirable . 
  oh this makes it up for the sarcasm . 
   it 's not like i 'm advocating europe not help people while shitting on turkey for not helping people enough . 
  well pardon me because all i saw was shitting on turkey , show me the part where you 've been advocating europe to help again ? 
  you 're shitting on turkey with this thread you posted , show me your other posts where you 're advocating for direct european involvement ? 
  let 's see how balanced you 've been . 
   ypg 's success in fighting in syria , due to its affiliation with the pkk , is in the long term a bad thing ( as far as turkish authorities are concerned ) . 
  best outcome for turkish authorities then is isis and kurds to wear eachother down . 
  exactly . 
  why should turks try to help the pkk ? 
  do you guys realize that the pkk is responsible for 40,000 deaths in turkey ? 
  it seems like it 's a bit of a joke for you guys . 
  it 's like asking the us to help al qaeda because `` isis is worse than them '' . 
  they 're both terrorists . 
  by the way turkey took in 200,000 kurdish civilians from kobane to save them from the conflict not including the 2 million syrian civilians it took in . 
  where 's the god damn appreciation ? 
  `` no turks you go and get killed fighting the isis barbarians and we 'll watch you from home . '', 
  if europeans are really that worried they can take the 2 million syrians off turkey 's hands since they 're not offering any sufficient humanitarian aid either or even send soldiers to fight the isis douche bags . 
  they can easily arrange to have european troops deployed to iraq and syria . 
  1 trillion dollar one or the 2 trillion dollar one ? 
  i did n't see this coming .

  second , we should really declare an official acceptance of armenian genocide . 
  not only because it indeed happened , but also stop irrelevant countries using it as a political leverage to us . 
  i mean what cyprus has to do with that at all . 
  implying people wants any other place, 
  he wants this down too . 
  he s an uncultured bafoon , i highly doubt if he even knows who barbara streisand is, 
  well as we all know german humour is a serious business , . 
  just how france and germany is now , we could be old enemies turned buddies, 
  go on . . 
  gib back , pls, 
  i m agree with the universality of justice and right of trial , if we do not create a standing ground we do n't have a chance of differentiating innocent from guilty . 
  oh you know , ones terrorist others freedom fighter until the freedom fighter bites back in the ass then its total annihilation . . / s, 
  [ maybe or maybe not ] ( http://i01.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/261/668/378/378668261_352.jpg ), 
   ca n't they just let the internet mock the man relentlessly so you re ok with mob justice instead of actual justice system provided by laws to seek equality ? 
  they took our jobs now they decide what is free or not . 
  make america great again ... / s sometimes i have hard time differentiating comical shows and reality when isee topics like this . 
  it s not only a shitty tent , it was kinda last straw for us , belgium and france refused extradition of active pkk members , who had active roles in shootings bombings and so on in turkey , for years and let pkk establish base of operations in their soil and sold weapons to them . 
  it could be so to use as leverage against turkey or in any other cause , but we turks are quite bitter when its about pkk , not kurds . 
  and this justifies belgium 's support for terrorism by letting pkk members in their country by ... how ? 
  what ... thats a first, 
  what armenian genocide has to do with this now . 
  stop whatabatism our topic is kurds and pkk terrorist i could brought up belgium 's war crimes in africa too if you wan na play that game . 
  anyway we all accept our faulty policy against kurds 15-20 years ago which led the establishment of pkk , but the discrimination policy has changed for 15 years and kurds in turkey literrally has every equal right from having their own tv broadcast to role in parliment . 
  they just happened to kill several thousand of innocent turkish civilians during years but oh turkish lives does n't matter anyway , after all pkk is a feminist , progressive , peace loving , anti bieber , democratic organisation . 
  just like isis, 
  maybe everything would be better if you guys could learn how to differentiate pkk terrorists from all kurds, 
  if we are going to banter with 4chan style , maybe you should flush the freaking toilet sometimes before someone puts its turd onto your freaking kitchen mate, 
  maybe we should start caring about them . 
  is n't it a lazy excuse to forget and live on, 
  see this is the problem . 
  dividing terrorism victims as `` we '' and `` them '' , exactly what would terrorists want . 
   `` turkey is somewhere exotic , somewhere we holiday , but not somewhere we need to understand or lavish with our sympathy . '', 
  do n't you guys think if we are against terrorism we should stop cherry picking which ones to condemn and be united against all terrorism , without bias without anger we should stand united not divided , leaving others alone just because different culture and religion . 
  id like to point out how / r/europe 's changed colors too.two terrorist attacks happened in turkey recently and we did n't saw this much of compassion from our western friends . 
  maybe people would feel much more connected and united worldwide against terrorism if western society could stop cherry picking which attacks to condemn and which attacks to ignore . 
  if you re going to change the flag of subreddit then do it by every attack do not pick the ones you wish so . 
  if you re against terrorism be it so you re fighting with every terrorist organizations , not the ones who hurt you , if you re going to be compassionate to the victims do not pick only ones you are in common , be compassionate to every terrorism victims . 
  and then maybe we can stand united against terrorism in a better world . 
  a humouristic picture of a middle finger , related to the recently attacked countries culture . 
  well done now we can go and forget like we always did because we saved the illusion of strong will, 
  i am deeply sorry to see others suffer the same pain with us in istanbul couple of days ago , and i want to say that you re not alone as much as you are with us . 
  terrorism shall not win . 
  * slow applause *, 
  fear us :d, 
  im sorry it was not my intention to personally insult him just pointing the part that he s having an agenda, 
  piss off, 
  here take a biscuit, 
  this is fucking outrageous , now do we have to accept every criminal human garbage that noone wants while europe can cherry pick the well educated well behaving ones in return ? 
  fuck that , this is fucking bullshit . 
  it 's a treason to accept such a deal, 
  oh hey there our lovely racist mascot good to see you in another turkish related topic, 
  we all sit and watch the fall of those european values my friend , and the rise of extreme right wing .

  is your hostility coming from me being just turkish ? 
  when i said source i was referring to an international unbiased news agency . 
  ca n't take that site much serious im afraid . 
  could you give me the source of current active war crimes please ? 
  asking the real questions, 
   uncomfortably close they were in the shop across the street, 
  mom had one . 
  those bastards never shut up for a second . .

  wait a min , they say what ? 
  unacceptable !, 
  but i 'm a cat person :(, 
  id say greece because culturally we are almost same , at least western parts of turkey sharing the same habits with greeks in way of living . 
  loud , proud and family oriented, 
  well we are truly sorry about missing kardashians though . 
  unlawful turkish intervention in syria ? 
  the whole cluster fuck started with agreeing on building a usa based qatar-turkey pipeline to weaken dependency on russian gas , then this whole civil war happened out of no where . 
  if you have some brain you can connect the dots my friend . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/is-the-fight-over-a-gas-pipeline-fuelling-the-worlds-bloodiest-conflict/news-story/74efcba9554c10bd35e280b63a9afb74 ) even the bloody aussies have a better understanding on this conflict than you could ever have . 
  western powers are actively destabilizing middle east since 1900s for energy sources do you have anything to say about that too ? 
  says who . 
  til turkey is guilty for every problem out there, 
  also visa requirements for turlish citizens were so outrageous that it became literally an insult to us , things like asking a bank account having a lot of money not touched for 3 months , legal papers of our family members current income , our current income , our education status and so on , they act like we are some possible criminal trying to smuggle ourselves into an eu country . 
  its been a topic for many years that how unfair the visa process they throw to us , tis had to be changed and im glad we can use current refugee crisis in our interest, 
  it 's easy to ignore others problems while you 're sitting within the comfort of your home , until the same problem bites you back in the ass . 
  for excample this whole refugee crisis . 
  am dissapointed . 
  he probably said `` k\u00f6pr\u00fcn\u00fcn \u00fcst\u00fcnden ge\u00e7mek '' which can be roughly translated as `` to go over the bridge '' in this case when you replace the bridge with her name ( is emine ) which d be `` emine ` nin \u00fcst\u00fcnden ge\u00e7mek '' , or `` go over the emine '' meaning is a slang to `` fuck someone in a very disrespectful manner '' mostly rapish .

  after `` being warned for months to do not cross our borders '' shooting down the russian plane was a `` result '' , i am more intrigued to find out how did you manage to stay this ignorant , i mean this explained like thousands of times on reddit and not on this subreddit only . 
  alright we get it , you hate turks to the point of being bloodthirsty racist , but you need a hobby mate you are in every turkish related article , spreading hate speech, 
  you re provoking me by not peacefully surrendering . . !, 
  of course it ll be a job of some group no one ever heard of before .

  one of the most reputable turkish news agency reports that f-16s are in the zone , and 4 turkish tanks were involved in clash .

  night gathers and now my watch begins ... 
  that does n't sound right to me but i ca n't say i know much about greek politics . 
  some mps from syriza will be enough , because the opposition will vote it through . 
  looking forward to your input on this . 
  photos are reverse selfies now . 
  i admire your patience . 
  almost too intuitive . 
   creditors refuse their proposals for political reasons what are these reasons ? 
  are you talking about the potential snowball effect , reaction of countries like portugal , spain , italy ... etc ? 
  i agree with them about the debt restructuring but the whole evil creditors narrative needs to stop . 
  both parties handle this the way they think is right . 
  their interests and motives are different but syriza have been putting it like there has been a conspiracy against greece and they are being victimized . 
  what i do n't understand is how do they feel entitled to a debt structure . 
  it might be the best thing to do but that does n't mean you have a right to it . 
  [ service fee : 3 billion euros . 
  really my comment was about greece 's tax problem through undeclared revenue . 
  i do n't think i can convince you to `` trust '' the banks . 
  i do n't have your answers . 
  you should use whatever you think is right to use . 
  my point was that cards adress the problem . 
  we had that problem , but everyone uses credit/debit cards now . 
  nodody carries cash with them , so they have to give reciepts . 
  oh , now i see what i did there too . 
  1 percent of the 1 percent . 
  0.01 percent . 
  this new greek government 's ways are very unorthodox . 
  hope it turns out well . 
  though i think they need to drop the evil creditors narrative . 
  it helps no one . 
   as of tomorrow , with this very generous ` no ' that the greek people have given us - ignoring the fear created with closed banks and by the media - we will try to co-operate with our partners and we will invite them one by one to see if we can find some common ground . 
  and we will try to be positive . 
  - varoufakis so this was all a negotiation tactic ? 
  https://twitter.com/bbcrosatkins/status/617777123319791616 i do n't claim to know that this result is better or worse for greece .

  i do n't understand . 
  am i breaking the law if i take a picture of mona lisa or eiffel tower ? 
  i agree with everything you said except that these count as an excuse for not voting . 
  please vote . 
  this is like watching the office 's scott 's tods episode . 
  so much cringe . 
  if that 's how democracy should work , i think they should give people a little more time than a week for a decision that will shape their next fifty years . 
  i do n't see how this referandum will be benefitial to the process but good luck , neighbours . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees  migrants/refugees i am really tired of pointing out the differences . 
  okay , i will stop doing that . 
  1 - i get your point , it will depend . 
  i wrongly assumed we all agreed accepting refugees is a decent thing to do . 
  2 - i did n't say what you should do . 
  i commented on prime minister 's remarks . 
  countries generally do n't decide to accept refugees based on their responsibility on the matter . 
  prime minister 's comment was about refugees . 
  i agree economic immigration is a different thing . 
  i do n't see how this is forcing . 
  eu 's stance on the issue has been crystal clear . 
  no one was forced to join the union . 
  i do n't think anybody would disagree with you on that one . 
  of course ending the war would be a much better resolution to the problem . 
   the problem is that taking refugees is all that is really being proposed . 
  this is not true though , everyone has been disscusing how to react and whether to take action or not about syria for years now . 
  problem is they still do n't have a clue how to solve this . 
  we do . 
  is this something british redditors would give conservative government credit for ? 
  i just thought terrorism and fearmongering is interchangible in the context varoufakis used it . 
  i guess it does have an effect on the perception . 
  what am i missing ? 
  how does this changes things massively ? 
  you accept refugees because it 's a decent thing to do . 
  not because you feel guilty or because it 's a punishment or something . 
  this may be a little bit off topic but , what are the arguments for referandum being the right choice in this matter ? 
  was n't the recent general election primarily about this anyway ? 
  i did n't like what happened . 
  i wanted to read about greece . 
  i do n't think tsipras is qualified to be the prime minister of a country which is going through a major crisis .

  that would break the stereotype of german humour .

  i do n't think they authorize marches on istiklal anyway .

   the above videos and knowing how muslims from 3rd countries react when they see western women dressed the way they dress as opposed to the way they dress in the middle east . 
   are sexual crime rates high in syria ? 
   yes . 
   i think as a turkish muslim you 're just sensitive to criticism of people from your religion but i do n't really care about you and am more concerned with the safety of children than being politically correct . 
  it is clear from the links you 've posted about syria , the problem is a product of the war .

  had you actually cared about it , you would have spoken about hundreds of greek historical sites that are actually in danger unlike hagia sophia . 
  but no , not even 1/1000th care is given to them . 
  and that is exactly my point about you people being hypocrites . 
  we are honest about what we are , we will continue to be so . 
   honestly it 's pointless to debate with someone that sees the hagia sophia as a spoil of war and as a `` trophy '' of conquering another civilization 's city . 
  you have zero respect for the building , for you it 's only something to fuel your warmongery . 
  `` look what we took from you !, 
  it 's ours now and it 's a mosque !, 
  suck it ! '', 
  it fully shows what i meant about the kind of message you 'd be sending out . 
  it 's sad really . 
  yes , i am completely open about it . 
  we will continue to remind those who claim what is ours , that they will never have them . 
  i actually respect many greeks because they are wary of us for correct reasons , unlike other europeans who do so because of racism . 
  --------- tbh we can continue this back and forth forever . 
  result will be this ; if you want to be respected , first deserve it by actions . 
  you can start by giving us an equal `` goodwill '' action instead of demands and shit . 
  considering the `` size and importance '' of hagia sophia , you should start with restoring at least a hundred ottoman sites ( mosques , shrines , tombs , etc. 
  you know `` random '' , `` irrelevant '' , etc. 
  should be easy . 
  then we can talk about respect . 
  so am i understanding it correctly that `` keeping '' it a mosque as its owner decided 600 years ago is being disrespectful ? 
  i fail to understand how keeping/making it a mosque causes a disrespect `` history and culture '' . 
  especially considering it was not a museum in our `` history and culture '' . 
  i guess it is only important when it comes to how it was in european history and culture . 
  place of hagia sophia in our history is as a trophy , the greatest of trophies . 
  it is the symbol of our ownership of istanbul , our victory against romans and making their achievements ours ( both for past ones and for others continued to be made under ottoman empire ) . 
  making it a museum ** is disrespecting our history , and our people that earned us hagia sophia with their blood ** '' as for blowing it up , destroying such a great building for no reason would be being stupid but it would still be in our rights . 
  but i would rather see it destroyed than to see it under hands of others . 
  it will be ours until the end of history . 
   but people would criticize you for it not cause it hurts christians but cause you 'd be a fucking mongrel to do that . 
  also no , they did and continue to watch and do nothing as our heritage in balkans get destroyed . 
  i have never heard of europeans complaining of ottoman heritage being left to disrepair or were made into something it was not meant to . 
  your country destroyed much more than what we destroyed of greek history . 
  we continue to , as our resources allows , restore ancient greek and roman sites . 
  whole turkey is still full of them . 
  yet where is the mosques in greece ? 
  so we get shit because we did n't destroy it beforehand and actually preserved it ? 
   turning the museum into a mosque just to prove a point send the entirely wrong message than what you think it does , but sure , go ahead . 
  what kind of message it would send , then ? 
  it really is funny how unrelated european organizations somehow coincidentally always focus on hagia sophia . 
  did you ever hear them complain about the state of ottoman and turkic heritage ? 
  are n't they also of `` historical and cultural '' value ? 
  but no , it is always about hagia sophia and no , it does n't have to do with being christians or etc. 
  caring about `` history and culture '' , my ass ... you people are such hypocrites . 
  maybe they are reacting to that ? 
   would be a shame if they again cover up the byzantine artwork , or god forbid destroy it . 
  i fail to see why people assume it will be removed and why it ca n't be covered with curtains . 
  there is no need to harm them and they would only need to be covered during prayers . 
  we had such technology 1000 years ago and i am sure we can do it easily right now . 
  i also fail to see why we should care for feelings of orthodox christians . 
  it is ours to do as we wish . 
  and of course , it is symbolic . 
  foreigners acting as if they have any right to what is ours is an insult . 
  and the fact that we continue to endure this , is fucking humiliating . 
  even if i thought it would be better to stay as museum ( as an act of goodwill ) , i would change my decision just to give middle finger to insolent whiners . 
   can become a mosque if the owner ( which i guess it 's the turk state ) decides to do so . 
  actually the state does n't have the ownership of hagia sophia . 
  it is still owned by the waqf ( fund ) created mehmet ii the conqueror . 
  he put hagia sophia under his private ownership after the conquest instead of the state ownership . 
  state barely have any right to manage hagia sophia and its estates and can only do so because all wakfs were put under collective management . 
  technically all those wakfs are still required to keep to the will of the person that created the wakf . 
  and afaik it specifically states hagia sophia is to be used as a mosque . 
  in addition , the order from the council of ministers which decided change to museum is also suspect . 
  the signature wrote `` k.atat\u00fcrk '' but was signed before mustafa kemal 's got the atat\u00fcrk surname legally . 
  ( something like that . 
  [ here is a discussion about it if you know turkish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvr9q_bbssk ) . 
  warning : it is long ) so hagia sophia is still legally a mosque but people are `` illegally '' prevented from prayers . 
  though it being used as a museum is not actually exclusive of it being used as a mosque . 
  to add to this no one other than turks has any right to speak against our decision . 
  orthodox christians could have some justification to ask for a goodwill but they lost it after what they have done to mosques/masjids/tekkes / shrines/tombs on the lands they gained from us . 
  catholics lost it after they looted ( literally everything , they even took parts of walls thinking it would heal them . 
  wtf ?! ), 
  and made prostitute sing on inside it . 
   i do n't care if you have orgies well , it would n't be the first time ... 
   am also sorry why are you sorry ? 
  did you do anything wrong ? 
  considering how so few turks joined such organizations from turkey and how so many people in proportion joined from european muslims ( except turks ) , it is already obvious that problem lies with the failure of their governments . 
  now they are attacking the only thing keeping salafism from spreading among turks . 
  yet none of them are offering any alternative . 
  few years later they will complain about `` turkish terrorism '' as if they had no hand in it . 
  which is exactly the same thing that created these monsters of salafi jihadists . 
  west meddling in middle east without taking responsibility . 
  solution to all these actually lies in the hands of us and europeans . 
  but they will never do what is necessary simply because alternative does n't benefit them as much . 
   ethnicity of the ruler does not determine that . 
  of course it does . 
  it is not the only thing that determines it but is an important part . 
  what determines being a turkish state is how much of the state apparatus was created and led by turks . 
  also how much turkic influence the state had . 
  many turkic ruled states from ottomans to safavids to mughals had quite a lot common with how they came to power and how their state apparatus worked . 
  population itself is not the main determinator . 
  indeed , it is not the citizens that create the state but the ones in power . 
  citizens merely participate . 
  fyi the first turkic state in middle east was tulunids . 
  afaik they literally minted coins calling their state turk . 
  ( i remember it mentioned by the prince abbas hilmi who , by the way , is of egyptian dynasty.whom are also turkic :p )  i mean we are not discussing his theological views here . 
  and i did n't say anything about theology . 
  founding ideology of safavid empire was based on safaviyya tariqah and also shia sect . 
  shah ismail who was a turk was the person solely responsible for decision to adopt shiism .

  you can do better.but we never forget massacre in northern cyprus . 
  i hate that turkeys membership is using election promise.same as brexit . . it increasing decomposition and racizim . 
  just stfu brainless shit . 
  i never voted for erdogan.but noone is unfair all events.even erdogan may be right.just all the people need to be crossbench . 
  im sorry for my bad words . 
  i get angry instant to meaningless admonition . 
  i did n't say ` kurds are terrorist ' . if you checked my posted links you can see 2 years old boy cant be a member turkish state organisations ... 
   violence against kurds not kurds , just terrorist  human rights violations it is majority ( me too ) problems not just kurds  oppression just lol.being kurds are more advantage than being turks in turkey.they dont pay any tax or bills , using leakage current and taking grant-in-aid . i think kurds oppress turks.they are trouble for west turkey . 
   ethnic cleansing anothor bullshit.firstly check this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halabja_chemical_attack and guess who saved kurds ? 
  or do you have any info for your claim ? 
  turkey doe n't support al-qaeda . probably you mean al-nusra . al nusra supported by west ( especially usa ) too.hostile to assad should be created .

  just focus to protect your shitty land.russians will visit soon . 
  you already did . 
  edit : -7 ? 
  why so much hate ? 
  am i wrong ?

  i agree . . 
   kick out of nato , ban trading with eu , massive border controls , visa refusal to anyone who wants to come here with a turkish pass you passed holocoust 80 million . 
  turks live ok centuries without europe.no big deal . 
  what a brainless shit . 
  yes sir . 
   you almost got to join almost ? 
  really :d  give back northern cyprus , the greeks may throw you a blanket now you 're out in the cold . 
  oh it is more funny, 
   we should break out the big diplomatic guns just yet . 
  lol.nice threatening trying , but you are already doing this . 
  good shot.i do not understant purpose.who want for membership with what aim ? 
   cancelling the eu talks would send a strong message of displeasure oh sweet baby, 
  its so exhausting.reading the post is worse.just let it everyone to his own way . . 
  yeah it is better . 
  what are you ? 
  child or moron ? 
  just lol . 
  % 68 of turks dont support . 
  same as to usa . 
  and you try to learn morality to us.just lol, 
  % 100 agree . 
  it will be amazing for two sides . 
  amazing explanation !, 
  congratulations bro.g\u00fclen sect is like illumunati.he wants to be like ali hamaney in turkey . 
  i search these food in internet.no more commend cause greeks get me wrong . 
  if you check aegean sea you gon na see realy problem.some greeks island is far away to turkey 1-2 km . . so cant we fishing or etc in aegean ? 
  stop crying man . 
  gyros is fake greek food.its origin is d\u00f6ner . 
   technically at war are we in war ? 
  city datas gon na be more useful.our east border fuck our score . . 
   communist/anarchis i do not think that communist or anarchist could kill 30.000 people ( even babies ) and harm $ 550 billion ... 
   he and turkish are innocent - eu , us and everyone else are the enemies . 
  i have never seen positive commend about turks in reddit or west media.just see insult , humiliation , contempt , threatening , enjoy to turks problem etc. . just look on this topics comment about turks : i do not judge oneone.just no need for hypocrisy . 
  you already did since 1980 . 
  location and religion can not change.so both sides spends time anf energie for nothing since 1960 . 
  firstly ` dumd ' informs your iq and mindset.what is the point of humiliation to people ? 
  after that im absolutely agree with you for other parts.your politicians should talk this subjects and both sides should finish this theater.its just waste of time since 1960 . 
  nice brain.total populate 74.93 m and all turks are not muslim.ascertain correct , after you can write what you want.just dont bullshit . 
  how can you call someone ` muslim ' even no talking and no meeting ? 
  how can you understand that im nervous according to one question ? 
  any tricks ? 
  illumine us pls . 
   1999 : membership application is accepted 17 years.what is relationship gezi and negotiation ? 
  its just excuse . 
   possibility of turkey joining its always 0 . both sides spend their energie and time for nothing . 
   the eu are already on the path to grant major visa concessions even its never gon na happen.even in 2222 . dont worry . 
  why are you always trying to throw shit to turkey?all days , all comments?all subs ? 
  why you hate turks so much ? 
  1-do you think all fucking kurds are seculer ? 
  do you know altan tan ? , h\u00fcda-par ? , kurdistan islamic union ? , kurdistan islamic group ? , kurdistan islamic movement ? 
  2 - ` mhp is definitely not secular ' . definitely ? 
  how can you call this judgment ? 
  any source ? 
  3-i disslike akp and their voters but you can not say that all akp voters are islamist.it is can be true for majority not all . 
  4-dont forget % 50 kurds votes for erdo\u011fan .

  is n't it wrong resists someone 's desire for a better tomorrow for the actions of someone else ? 
  in my opinion those things are unacceptable . 
  yes , you are right . 
  i can see why poles would be afraid . 
  however there are a lot more variables in the radicalisation in the other eu countries . 
  do you think that if the things were explained adequately poles would change their minds ? 
  ( a genuine question , not sarcasm or mocking ), 
  on the other news , the sky is blue . 
  i was n't talking about poles . 
  i was talking the people in this sub . 
  very often they get offended when they are called islamophobic or racists , but then they turn to say stuff like this . 
  i can see why poles have that kind of opinion . 
  however , with enough care and help of the media , that opinion can be turned around very quickly , ca n't it ? 
  just show that muslim refugees are people who want to live a better life . 
  i think poles could relate to that . 
  ohh , and if i call you islamophobic for your reactions to this , you yell at me . 
  ohh . 
  the immigrants are coming . 
  they will hang out with people with similar cultures , the same way everyone acts . 
  they will want to have their families with them . 
  ohh people dream of a better future . 
  how dare they !, 
  ohh the days we used to mock the americans for stuff like this . 
  how much i miss you !, 
  my point exactly . 
  talking about how secularism brought equality is a bit pointless . 
  while i can make argue that for ukraine , i am not so sure about syria , mostly because i do n't have the data . 
  do n't also forget that fear of a famine is as strong as if not stronger than a famine . 
  did n't treaty of lisbon replace the old treaty of european constitution ? 
  look at the effects of the mini-ice age in the 17th century . 
  there are historian who have argued that the most of the wars and revolution at the time was caused by it . 
  it might be that change in climate might one of the factors in the wars and instability . 
  a-rabs come to europe , take our jobs , what do they give in return ? 
  heat . 
  / * on an unrelated note , i wonder if you would be able to link the recent heat and the increased immigrations . 
  it would be the first time climate change has caused immigration * /, 
  ohh come on . 
  ca n't make fun of the racists for once ? 
  there would be people who would argue that europe does some pretty undemocratic things and that secularism did n't create a perfectly equal society . 
  it , too , replaced one hierarchy with another a few years ago , the dutch and thee french had the constitution shoved down their throats even though referendums showed that the people were against it . 
  europe is mostly ruled by a political and economic elite , ai n't it ? 
  3 hours and no ` turkey = evil ' comments ? 
  weird . 
  yes , when we call them racist idiots , they start whining about political correctness . 
  it is mixed really . 
  turkish attitude to europe is a bit similar to the british one . 
  you tend to hear brits say ` going to europe ' . 
  we are part of europe but a bit apart . 
  a few years ago there were talks happening and a lot of improvements made . 
  while most turks feel that turkey would benefit greatly from the ascension , however most turks feel that eu has been a bit insincere towards us . 
  while most of the criticism was aimed at erdogan the same way tsipras is , however similar to now there was a lot of hostility aimed at the turkish people . 
  hell , it had become a meme over at / r/turkey . 
  around the april more intensely . 
  sometimes you have the dutch and germans ` complaining ' , too . 
   it might also be worth doing some sort of calculations as to the total value of their work . 
  you mean the part of the gdp they help produce ? 
  [ according to this ] ( http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/briefing-paper/1.5 ) , they are the 10 % of uk 's gdp while making up the 8 % of population . 
  exactly . 
  hell , immigrants can provide competition and an incentive to improve . 
  it would be better to represent the work quality of non-eu immigrants who can actually work , right ? 
  satire , really . 
  there are some fellows over here who say these type of things with a straight face . 
  i parody their own words , so they might realize what they are saying . 
  especially when you bother them . 
  how did you form an opinion on something that you do n't know ? 
  now , that is huge fault of the media . 
  government , when making a decision of this calibre should make sure that the media is properly informing the people . 
  dammit , europe needs some reforms . 
  it is fun . 
  yes , it is . 
  and undemocratic . 
  is n't democracy in the eu constitution ? 
  so the dutch and french governments acted undemocratically . 
  it was against the will of the people . 
  if the big wigs thought it would be beneficial to the people , they should have explained and discussed with the people . 
  is n't the western civilization based on reason ? 
  people have been telling me that since i was a kid . 
  so how come the governments do n't reason with their people ? 
  yes . 
  evil germans ? 
  the word ` evil ' there is unnecessary . 
  german implies evil . 
  and evil eu ? 
  i thought e stood for ` evil ' . 
  evil union , was it not ? 
  evil evil union ? 
  but if athens reforms as the creditors want which the country 's population has said clearly in a democratic manner that they are against it , would n't that make the athens an undemocratic government ? 
   `` my work here is done '' if the greeks could get work done , they would n't be in this mess . 
  that is partly why i made fun of it ( the other part is because i like mocking assholes ) . 
  and sometimes we should laugh at our state that we should cry at . 
  tell that to germany / s, 
  well , are they creating anything new ? 
  nope , just playing the same old songs over and over from 2200 years ago . 
  / s edit : you are aware that / s means sarcasm , right ? 
  maybe those greeks should have spend more time working than playing songs from 2200 years ago . 
  the article is in turkish . 
  i have tried to give a rough translation of the article . 
  turks of / r/europe help me improve it . 
   matters pertaining to peace and security of our citizens were discussed in detail . 
  possible threats and measures taken and to be taken for the country 's security were assessed in precision .

  mongolian actually has more loanwords from turkic than vice versa . 
  we will never '' '' '' `` unite '' '' '' '' with gavurs . 
  bulgar ( ian ) s are actually confused turks . 
  true story, 
  do n't know about that , my dudes descended from y\u00f6r\u00fcks and sufis . 
  plus everybody partially descended from people who were forced to `` change culture '' . 
  tell me about it . 
  you 're a serb , i 'm a serb , he 's a serb , everybody is a serb !, 
  they are the biggest guys around , it 's all relative . 
  putin also lost half his hair . 
  i think he 's compensating for his lack of hair . 
  dat engrish in the title tho, 
  that 's indo-european languages for ya . 
  because they think respectable women should n't present their bodies to the public . 
  nudity and the like was probably associated with prostitution . 
  seems like russians take their pro wrestling seriously, 
  truly a top analysis by a top mind . 
  why stop there ? 
  attack them and tell them to accept your values or die ? 
  tell me about it . 
  resistance is futile . 
  yeah i 'm not getting into a history argument because some offended spaniard is trying to be passive aggressive . 
  not falling for it this time . 
  but yeah , not impressed . 
  well that 's better , you beat half naked people with obsidian spears . 
  do n't be so mad for preveza , bro !, 
  shit happens . 
  we seem to have lost thrace , hmm . 
  wow you killed and enslaved people with the help of apocalypse diseases much impress, 
  realistically , greece since i can literally see their islands from my house and could probably swim/hop on a boat to there . 
  ideally , somewhere * very * comfortable considering i just went through hell . 
   also should n't turkey be bursting full with it ? 
  na , we do n't care . 
  `` oh look , another x thousand year old artefact/place , cool . 
  back to something else '' . 
   i mean seriously , ~ ~ if you 're a young , blonde , caucasian woman , you ~ ~ do not go camping in some remote part of pakistan . 
  fixed . 
  avoid remote places in general , they naturally tend to be pretty lawless . 
  i 've heard/experienced that taliban/al-qaeda tends to go easy on turks . 
  do n't want em to start being hostile to us too . 
  take what kurds/pkk say with a truckload of salt . 
  thank you , this will last for a few months . 
  should n't have reported on who rescued them , i hear they tend to trust us more than they trust westerners or arabs . 
  what is their point with this ? 
   p.s. 
  : wow , a german making fun ~ ~ of other people 's accents . ~ ~, 
  nobody in this subreddit has heard of zaalouk or bessara and baklava is controversial , you might know this . 
  the moroccan kebab site does n't include the history of it and wants me to go to the european version of the site , fuck that . 
  bottom line : do n't be an america , man !, 
  which ones ? 
  all of these are turkish . 
  this is n't a joke , how would it work ? 
  what is it then ? 
  \\ - adolf hitler, 
  probably because it 's not balkan . 
  false , it 's filled with meat/potato/vegetables etc. 
  take that back blz, 
  most of them are downvoted , indicating their opinion is unpopular . 
  get this 4chan shit out, 
   it 's because the self-hating/loathing seems to be a typical european thing trust me , it 's not . 
  everybody says this . 
   so you are one of those people ? 
  dat alienation, 
  same ! ^ ^ ^ ^ 1000 ^ ^ ^ ^ years ^ ^ ^ ^ ago, 
  druuums . . 
  yes , we get it . 
  scandinavia looks like a penis . 
  we have a guy who literally does nothing but post pro-akp/tayyip stuff for years in / r/turkey too . 
  got ta love shills . 
  we kiss when greeting too , some who think that 's too sensual for them just use headbutts ( tilt the head and touch foreheads on each side once or twice ) . 
  no offense but no one cares . 
  / r/european [ is pretty good for that sort of stuff , they have free discussions and respect every opinion . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lrz2r.gif ) also got ta love having a `` quality discussion '' with people who agree with you . 
  that 's the thing , why are they whining about it if it was the norm then ? 
  it 's just one giant whirlwind of cognitive dissonance . 
  generally the easiest way to visualize these is to switch the sides and see how they react . 
  i 've heard of ukraine supplying crimea and south cyprus supplying the north in similar situations and figured something of that sort was the case here , i 'm *** shocked *** that he was dishonest . 
  also they call us cruel but worship a guy who literally bragged about torturing women & children to death . 
   big scary serbia ha , do n't flatter yourself . 
  also afaik the reason they still get those utilities from serbia is because otherwise serbia would basically be giving up it 's `` claim '' and admit that they no longer control the place . 
  but yeah , i can understand your frustration . 
  * the west has been fighting perceived terrorism everywhere , on stage , on tv , in literature , not to mention iraq and afghanistan , but when actual terrorists show up it 's `` welcome , phreedom phighters and oil providers '' . 
  * * and i 'm not sure you could host a meeting of holocaust-denying , bin ladin-admiring islam supremacists in netherlands , some of these guys are wanted in parts of europe . 
   there 's no ideological split with iran or saudi arabia ha, 
  mmm yes , hydrogen cyanide goes really well with my slav lungs . 
   the pax americana is drawing to an end and in one or two decades time not really , america is by faaar the most powerful and wealthiest nation on earth . 
  we have * at least * 50 years till they fizzle out ( and that 's if something extraordinary happens ) i 'd say . 
  china is rising fast but they still have literally hundreds of millions of people in poverty . 
  besides , there is no ideological split like there was with soviets . 
  so none , who thinks the french flag is racist ? 
  source ? 
  go ramble on / r/european . 
  but of course . 
  race relations are complex [ but here 's an excellent explanation . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1plkvj/risky_question_why_is_black_face_as_part_of_a/cd3kxjh ) you might notice it talks about america but it applies to colonial european nations too . 
  it 's depressing that many people here think it 's something vague to joke about that happened in the past but it affects millions of people to this day and it 's serious , just keep that in mind . 
  sorry to ruin your fun everybody !, 
  404 : context not found, 
  invalid statement, 
  haha slavery lol,

  smokers cost less on healthcare because they die earlier and they most often die from heart attack not cancer . 
  people that grow old are the ones that cost the healthcare most . 
  also cigarettes are heavily taxed , smokers are probably on that regard paying back more to healthcare than they cost . 
  if you do n't believe it , you can check the statistics online . 
  nothing wrong with loving your country . 
  however i find that nationalism makes people delusional and disingenuous about faults of their country and excessively confrontational about other 's . 
  it is important to remember people are individuals first . 
  love this piece , it is so great to see it played it like that . 
   are you implying that a majority of the refugees are '' doctors and professors '' ? 
  he was obviously being sarcastic . 
  none taken . 
  i just do n't think turkish is a bad sounding language though , it is a fairly monotone language with no guttural sounds . 
  neutral about it . 
  i think he was liberal in his own retarded way . 
  if we remember accepting a syrian person as swedish in sweden is considered liberal . 
  that 's a really low blow . 
  napoleon losing most of his army coming back from russia has had even a bigger impact in my opinion or even peninsular war . 
  however yeah , the importance of waterloo is overblown . 
  especially because it is presented as a glorious victory over the enemy of free peoples of middle-earth . 
   more generalist babble what are you even talking about , i specifically talked about your arguments and are you so stupid to not be able to understand the general arguments i gave were because you use general statements to contrast an exception ? 
  you are the one for the last several posts making generalizations and reductive comments without addressing literally any of my points . 
   translation : i have no historic arguments that are relevant in the context i literally wrote an essay above which were all historical context . 
   i will not concede my point regardless because i 'm religiously invested in it that would require me being a muslim , which i am not and i never was , i am talking as a person who dislikes people who takes sides in history because of current political events . 
  you are the one religious invested in , because it is important to you that ottomans were muslims , as opposed to others who have might have done exceptionally brutal , because that is relevant today to your interests . 
   so i 'll accuse you of being a bigot instead . 
  in this conversation you have been the one accusing me of various things , while talking in buzzwords and not assessing my points individually like i have done to yours . 
  you just have done with religion for example . 
  i did not accuse you of being a bigot , for all i care you might be the most open-minded person in the world , i accused you of using history to draw parallels for your current political beliefs , which you are doing . 
   standard regressive ideology at work standard regressive left meme, 
  because you pulled the conversation that way ? 
  i responded to your assumptions and your factual errors , talked about people because that is the required context and ideas as well , since i talked about janissary system as a general . 
  you have made a claim that ottomans were exceptionally brutal and bloody , which i disagreed , as a rule of logic i gave you general examples and specific examples to contrast to show that they were n't . 
  i told you that if you knew the history better you could make that argument on an individual basis instead . 
  i gave you examples of exceptional brutality and bloodiness , from ottoman side as well which you could use to make an actual argument . 
  i responded to your factual errors of janissary system and i said janissary system in particular is n't even worst part of ottomans . 
  on top of this i never denied ottomans were brutal or bloody but you argued as if i made that claim , which i did n't . 
  your entire argument was that i am romanticizing which is an entirely baseless claim since i dislike them and i ca n't be romanticizing if i am actively talking about their negative sides without talking about a single positive side , do you even know what romanticizing is ? 
  aside from using it as a buzzword against states you dislike ? 
  at the end of the ordeal all you do is act smug and pretend i cherry picked when i individually responded to your claims and more . 
  you would n't be convinced without the opposition considering ottoman actions in a vacuum with a completely black & white mentality while ignoring rest of the world , which you ca n't ignore when your claim is with a comparative term and not an absolute one . 
  so let 's end the conversation here because this is n't about history , it is about current politics and you only use history as justification . 
  dutch sounds like someone trying to speak english , german and french simultaneously while choking on their drink . 
   generalised platitudes again with zero specifics . 
  when someone makes a comment suggesting a specific case was exceptional , you provide a general statement to argue that it was n't specifically exceptional , because you are arguing exception versus general . 
  if you try to disprove an exceptional case with another exceptional case , that does n't make it less exceptional and instead is whataboutism , you prefer that as an argument ? 
  i would guess so actually , i am certain you would enjoy a pissing contest about who did what horrible things historically . 
  so , yes , my comment was general statement because i am not interested in making arguments about more brutal or bloody cases , i just gave couple examples above of exceptionally brutal and bloody occurrences , in hopes of giving you the hint of what exceptional cases of history are . 
  if you want more i can give , such as julius ceaser 's treatment of gauls , mongolian treatment of the chinese and assyrians in general , leopold 's congo for occupation instead of war . 
   this is common to those that romanticise ottoman empire and islamic civilization . 
  creating a strawman to argue against without taking into consideration anything i have said . 
  i do n't romanticize either , if anything i dislike ottomans , yet you see anything less than your own negative opinion of them as romanticizing , placing your own subjective standards as an objective measurement , which would n't bother me if you had more knowledge in the area . 
  i am not ignoring their wrongdoings or shortcomings thus i am not romanticizing them , i do n't even like them , you are the one focusing here specifically on one civilization while ignoring others , as an argument of alleged exceptional actions . 
  who is romanticizing whom when your selective conscience is targeting what you consider to be the other while ignoring what you consider the in-group ? 
  better yet i think what you are doing is a bitter `` revenge '' for certain european leftists about white guilt because of slavery or perhaps idolizing islamic caliphates during their peak , so you are not arguing about your own wrong statement about exception but rather as a general rule to prove that `` others were worse ! '' . 
  which is whataboutism . 
   they were codified within civil law , and said children were then used as shock troops for further conquest as they grew a bit . 
  yes , devshirme or otherwise known as blood tax was a systemic draft and enrolled kids into a specific education that made them either administrators or soldiers . 
  in that it is forced slavery . 
  you ca n't think of any other examples of forced draft , levies or serfdom , really ? 
  it is not similar to atlantic slave trade for example , because devshirmes while technically slaves in that they were forced to service , were paid and could hold positions of power way greater than the average citizen . 
  not to say one is better or not , since ottomans themselves were also involved in slave trade , like all of the empires powerful enough at the time until abolishment of it . 
  also janissaries were definitely not shock troops . 
  shock troops of ottoman army were the cavalry , not elite infantry . 
  janissaries were support troops and were often in reserve , they also served as the sultan 's personal royal guard and were sent around the different parts of empire that did n't have spahis to bring local order . 
  you are completely and absolutely wrong and have no idea what you are talking about if you think janissaries were shock troops when they were elite soldiers used generally to clean up enemy army . 
  you also do n't know more than half of the ottoman army was actually cavalry and janissaries were not a main body . 
   codification of this barbarism in law over centuries is what allowed ottoman conquest to be as powerful as it was , and as exceptionally brutal as it was . 
  yes , national draft made powerful armies , that 's why stronger empires switched to a draft system instead of relying on mercenaries and levies , making organized and professional armies . 
  which janissaries and tercios are considered to be first in modern era . 
  what i have given was a side comment however , not related to discussion at hand about an exceptional case . 
   and eventually it broke down largely because said stolen children started to turn against them as they overextended . 
  the `` stolen '' children only turned against sultans because sultans wanted to abolish the system . 
  young osman dissatisfied with performance of janissaries wanted abolish them for a national army but they did n't want their rights revoked , which at the time grow to such degree they were basically political and military elite above most of the society . 
  other times where they revolted were times that ottomans wanted to modernize the army , since janissaries were exceptionally traditionalist . 
  a lot of the mistreatment of locals were done by the janissaries , by the way , some of the most brutal governors and events were all devshirme children . 
  there is even a case where sultan helped serbians against janissaries , because they were an uncontrollable , terrible bunch . 
  an obvious mistake to rely on zealous and extremely traditionalist soldiers for local security . 
  in comparison to janissaries , timarli spahis , the drafted cavalry and close equivalent of knights of europe , has way less mistreatment . 
  a focus on janissary system in specific without taking into consideration anything else , ignoring rest of the world shows both a lack of knowledge and a deliberate ideological aim . 
  obviously not interested in actual rational discussion or objective consideration but pushing an agenda and using specific events in history to justify it . 
   this romanticised version of ottoman invasion and islamic world in general is getting tiresome . 
  i am not romanticizing anything , you are . 
  i said they were brutal and bloody but not exceptionally so , you are the one assuming that everyone else were n't somehow brutal and bloody , i am guessing especially europeans ? 
  this just shows that you have romanticized view of history but selectively so . 
   they were the key players in properly industrialized slavery , and the key players in institutionalizing systemic slave raiding , systemic child theft and forced conversions . 
  yes , they have done all of this and i am not defending them , yet to say that these were exceptional ? 
  because they were n't , you know about all the atrocities ottomans committed and are against them because they are the other and did these in europe , while turning blind eye to everything else in rest of the world , because they are outside of your realm of conscience . 
  besides `` child theft '' and forced conversions were the vast minority of the conversions but that 's irrelevant . 
   because there 's a limit to what you can do in a single war . 
  yes , indeed and there is much to do during an occupation , that 's why ottoman conquest was n't exceptionally brutal . 
  there have been cases of horrible treatment of natives by soldiers and mercenaries during occupation but those are not exceptional either . 
   ottomans on the other hand were brutal over hundreds of years , and not because individual ruler was particularly bad , but because the system in the state was aimed to produce that level of brutality . 
  you see , if you had an actual knowledge about ottoman history , you could make a very good argument here about individually exceptionally bloody and brutal leaders , such as murad iv but you do n't know those and you can not make that argument because your argument is n't based on knowledge but ideology . 
  if you also knew ottoman history you would also know that there was n't any institutionalized consensus about treatment of ottoman subjects amongst the sultans and they had all very different ideas , some better some worse , yet you do n't know enough to properly discuss that topic either to present arguments . 
  i am sorry but people are too emotionally invested with current geopolitical events , politics and too bitter with their politicians due the situation with muslim immigrants to rationally discuss history regarding a muslim empire , especially considering how much propaganda about said empire exists in both turkish resources and balkan ones . 
  you do not argue from a historical point of view , you are just looking to justify your opinions on a greater , historical basis . 
  fyi : i am not a fan of ottomans at all , they are n't even remotely close to being one my favourite historical nations , they are not even my preferred muslim state in history . 
  do n't make me defend them by being wrong , because i do n't care about them . 
   ottoman invasion was exceptionally bloody and brutal . 
  it was n't in ottoman interest to be bloody or brutal because that would completely alienate their population , when they did that later on , 18th century and onwards soon enough all parts of empire broke apart .

  but europe is our door neighbour , so learning from europe is more logical . 
  we need a friendly europe toward us , and we must be friendly towards europe . 
  noone wants a troublesome neighbour . 
  some shitheads forget how greeks helped us in our 1999 istanbul earthquake . 
  if you be good to your neighbour they be good to you as well . 
  we have to have full cooperation with europe , socially , socio-economically , we are already in nato . 
  turks has to go to europe , see what is right and what is wrong there and have to adopt it to our own country . 
  i believe in that . 
  i am an atheist , my wife-to-be is polish . 
  i do not live a different lifestyle than a lets say portugese or serbian or british or swedish . 
  but not all my countrymen are same . 
  if someone asks me , i would respond i am asian . 
  i hope we get our shit together . 
  i believe we will someday , probably not close future but someday . 
  societies evolve , change . 
  thank you for good wishes . 
  edit ; i am not living a relative european lifestyle because i am an atheist or my fiancee is polish . 
  i live because i have rised like this . 
  there are countless people in turkey that lives how an ordinary european lives eventhough they are muslim . 
  i want to make this comment of mine clear, 
  true ; ( 0f course not 100 % , duh ) - we are over nationalistic and irrationally thinking '' everyone is hating us and enemy to us '' . 
  - we are mostly uneducated , even we are educated it does not improve our daily life . 
  like traffic culture or mutual tolerance . 
  - we are no europeans . 
  - we do our business more socially rather than following rules . 
  well , we actually hate rules , and poor education feed this instinct further more . 
  - our food is good . 
  false ( of course not 100 % , as if it is possible ) - not everyone supports erdogan or any ideology he represents . 
  - not everyone lives like a middle eastern . 
  actually not everyone in me is living in a stereotypical me life but it is more obvious in turkey . 
  - we are no middle east . 
  - we are no arabs . 
  even there is a sad racism towards arabics in turkey . 
  - most of the rules that you can think about an arabic-islamist country ( woman vote , outdoor alcohol consumption , illegalization of lgbt , illegalization of other faith 's practise , sharia etc. ), 
  - we were not used to this isis style bombings and terror acts until very recent . 
  ( beside there were always other ways of threat of terrorist act but they mostly was not intersectiong with everday peoples lifes ) - kebab is way more various than the version europeans eat . 
  it is just one kind . 
  and we do not eat kebab everyday . 
  there are better food than kebab . 
  kebab is just '' meh '' . 
  - it is not desert starting just right after you pass greek or bulgarian border . 
  i am not sure even if we have a proper desert area , probably not . 
  you are right i guess , we are pretty messy when we have picnic outdoors . 
  but we had n't had much time to collect the litter when that sobieski pal came and told us `` go home , you are drunk , go go go '' . 
  joke aside , it is magnificant how even terrible incidents can create something good . 
  i hope one day visit vienna for its coffee houses . 
  whattt ? 
  we just came to '' visit '' you and you looted our coffee beans ?? 
  how rude ... 
  it is clear now why we had huge headaches after '' visit of vienna '' for so long ... you looted our coffee beansss . 
  in my family they are conservatives and more pro-state . 
  my balkan side family were almost all farmers or farmer descendants . 
  so that may be the reason of their conservatism . 
  the old generation is pretty uneducated . 
  however i forgot to add the balkan immigrants are known by their drinking habit . 
  they drink much . 
  in immigrant neighbourhood where i live it is so common to see mosque and a pub next to each other . 
  my grandma is kosovar . 
  so ; albanians in turkey are known by their temper and stubbornness . 
  oh boy , you got ta meet my father . 
  we say `` albanians tie their shoelaces loose so someone can trip on them hence they can have a delicious fight '' . 
  also it is said '' marry an albanian girl but never think about marry an albanian guy '' . 
  albanian girls makes the best foods and best pastries . 
  guys are , well i told above you got ta meet my father . 
  since one part of my family is balkan immigrants we have so many bosniaks in my family circle too , since they tend to marry inbetween the society ( however this is not a case nowadays , they are so blended in ) . 
  bosniaks are beautiful people . 
  their borek is wonderful . 
  they like to keep their society closer . 
  most of them forget their language as the last generations that immigrated passed away . 
  albanians too ( my grandma was born in turkey , she was understanding albanian very well , but speaking little and they didnt teach to my father albanian which is sad ) . 
  both albanians and bosniaks in turkey either have some conservative or some very secular portions . 
  for example in my broad family bosniaks and albanians are pretty pro erdogan eventhough my dad is an atheist . 
  and tatars are wonderful people . 
  i have studied university in a tatar city in turkey ( crimean tatars ) . 
  they are very nice people . 
  very hardworking and very clever guys . 
  it is for sure , turkish republic owe so much to his once immigrant citizens . 
  note : my grandma 's father and mother had come turkey during balkan wars . 
  well , actually sometimes polish sound me some like japanese . 
  naprawd\u0119 . . especially when i first started to learn it . 
  especially when you say `` nie ma za co '' . . is n't is so japanese ? 
  first examples comes to my mind in that case are ; ile pan ma lat ? 
  co za debil . 
  when you do not use typical polish \u015b rz \u0107 etc sound it kinda sounds like japanese . 
  however i am losing this sense as i am learning more and more and it starts to sound me more similar . 
  edit : as i think when the word ends with a - u it is more visible . 
  like ide do domu , kto idzie do mojego domu ... 
  because it breaks the balance . 
  membership of turkey means more representation for turkey on european parliament and less for germany and france who are the brain of eu . 
  in case of brexit , yea maybe turkey would fill that blank without disturbing the power much , but the reality is turkey is more americanist . 
  i sincerely believe in a eu as a third power in the world . 
  unfortunately , in this realistic world we need powers , it balances the shit in the world . 
  i want eu to be a third body next to usa and russia . 
  that is why i am a little happy about brexit . 
  if turkey wears off american puppy costume and works for the benefit of europe , that it would be lovely for eu , and they would gain a good front and source for their sphere of influence , but it is not like this . 
  btw having good relationships with usa and being a puppy of it different things . 
  second thing is economy . 
  since turkey is below the average of eu in economic terms , it will get subsidies like bulgaria , romania and poland do . 
  but turkey is bigger than this countries . 
  turkey will give less than it takes until he catches the eu standarts .

  as a society that comes from the tradition of sultans and caliphs , we have a tendency to connect an ideology with a person . 
  even if erdogan 's ideology means refusing to create a `` personality cult '' the erdogan supporters are going to remember him forever by hanging pictures of him everywhere and even creating erdogan statues . 
  unlike what you think most erdogan supporters are not social liberals . 
  it will happen only when he dies . 
  and then there will be 3 types of people in our country , people that worship ataturk - people that worship erdogan and people that worship abdullah ocalan . 
  i am talking about the `` united people '' thing . 
  if you are a moderate then you are willing to assimilate . 
  the turks in europe do n't assimilate and live in their own worlds as they do n't want to be integrated with the country they live in ; because they think that will make them lose their religious values and culture . 
  the reason they will stay united is n't because it 's a turkish culture to stand united , it 's because they live in the 1950s . 
  european turks did n't progress the same way turkish turks did . 
  `` not talking about more extreme forms of patriotism or nationalism ( which , admit it or not , turks tend to suffer from ) but a moderate , healthy dose of them . '', 
  i think your history shows that that does n't work with you . 
  about your point on turks , that 's probably very true for turks in europe . 
  in my experience turks that live in turkey are more moderate than turks in europe . 
  it 's a cultural thing though , i do n't know this but do men in scotland walk around in kilts in public places ? 
  not with the intention of fucking someone over ; but with the intention of being a strong country . 
  our land is what unites us , outside of that there really is n't one typical turk . 
  the first one is true . 
  and like i said , i ca n't tell you why i enjoy the first one . 
  you can list 100 negative things about it ; but there is a reason i secretly enjoy it people ... 
  why do you have to turn this into a rant and an argument ? 
  i know we are x , i am telling you that we are x and you still say `` you are x you are x '' . 
  yes we murdered your christian brothers , yet to this day you still cause so much suffering for the muslim world and you can somehow still talk about the armenian genocide . 
  it 's ironic really . 
  shit happened , we are not genocidal racist maniacs that regularly masacre people . 
  there are still around 100.000 armenians living in turkey ( some of my friends ) and they are not getting murdered or suffering discrimination at all eventhough turkey in general hates them . 
  we saw what happened to the jews that live on your land that did n't even do half of what the armenians did during the ottoman war . 
  please keep your hatred out of topics like this . 
  none of this will change my views , it 's a deeply rooted feeling my friend . 
  i do n't like stereotypes that are untrue :d the part about moustache is generally true , nobody wears a fez though . 
  i enjoy the stereotypes about turks that we are invaders and fascists . 
  i secretly enjoy it when eastern europeans complain about the `` turkish occupation . '', 
  i do n't know why really , just being honest . 
  yes , to their own countries not to turkey . 
  i do n't want more islamist akp voters . 
  `` and of course i know they 're illegal economic immigrants , this is why they should be kicked back to their countries . '', 
  too bad they destroy their ids . 
  good luck finding out where they came from . 
  i am talking cheap labor, 
  you want them to seek asylum in their own country . . 
  i do n't know how that makes sense . 
  besides they do n't need to seek asylum anyways , they are economic migrants . 
  is that huge ass country turkey ? 
  if it is why is turkey `` their '' country again ? 
  we do have an obligation to take them back now . 
  erdogan 's party passed the bill to take the refugees back in the parliament . 
  just waiting on that no fly zone . 
  ca n't the refugees be used as a workforce to help the greek economy ? 
  they are scared of a revolt or something ; but i do n't think economic migrants care about revolting and % 80 of these migrants are that . 
  not the case for every muslim country . 
  reis . . lol, 
  if the current events did n't teach the west anything i do n't know what will . 
  you ca n't try to bring `` democracy and peace '' in a region like middle east and expect it to happen without causing tidal waves of shit across the world . 
  this is the middle east , not europe . 
  proper democracy and equality takes blood here , a lot of it . 
  i do n't think the `` my daily life in russia '' post was a shitpost tbh . 
  it made me feel good about living in turkey which does n't happen easily . 
  your post does n't make me feel good . 
  i want free coffee :(, 
  it 's very disrespectful anyways . 
  sounds to me like they decided not to invite greece because they decided to screw greece over anyways lol . 
  yes . 
  turkish opposition parties talk about this a lot , it 's a known info inside turkey that the akp government aided and sent weapons to jihadists inside syria , possibly isis . 
  the reason so many turks stand up for their country online despite that is because a lot more countries supported those jihadists before us . 
  keeping track of the refugees is probably an important thing to do for the benefits of your country 's citizens though . 
  turkish generals have very , racist but true observations on the arab militaries dating back to the ottoman empire . 
  arabs are known to be bad at fighting wars . 
  i love it, 
  he is the leader of the main opposition party . 
  he has immunity and if erdogan put him in prison for this , he would make the opposition look like heroes . 
  and it 's completely ok for us to hold all the refugees ; because reasons . 
  none of us are , he is slowly turning turkey into a shithole . 
  but in the end turkey is much more than just erdogan . 
  yes only one article . 
  not half of your leaders and dozens of articles every week . 
  we watch the eu leaders and pm candidates ' videos on why we should never be allowed into the eu you know and they are usually pretty honest about it , no mention of `` dictatorship '' or `` erdogan '' at all . . just general racism and discrimination . 
  god the western world disgusts me sometimes , kick turkey out of nato because of erdogan ? 
  that makes sense . 
  why did we even ruin our relationship with russia and china i 'll never know . 
  yes democracy is not big outside of the western world ; but i 'd rather have non democratic allies ; then turkophobic `` allies '' that use one guy to constantly shit on my country . 
  no you are not , recent events have shown me that nato does n't really unite member countries, 
  tbh erdogan doesnt really like ataturk ; but he has to act like he does because a good portion of his voters do, 
  we do have military videos , they are just not ads . 
  that 's the turkish version of iraq . 
  they want `` ileri demokrasi '' in turkey , meaning a democracy that is not limited to elections . 
  they are the only political party that has good relations with the pro-kurdish party . 
  they work together on a lot of issues in the parliament . 
  they are the party that brought secularism to the country and want civil liberties to be as wide as possible , they support things like gay marriage as an example . 
  i ca n't really go into further detail as my english wo n't allow it ; but simply put the chp is like the european side of turkey . 
  no , people wo n't vote for the chp no matter what . 
  it 's not a possibility after the 1980s coup , where the military called the chp a political party `` without religion '' . 
  what place on the internet is n't a fuck turkey club ? 
  guys . . 
  i need a hug . 
  one thing i know is that the pkk/pyd force their ideology on their people . 
  i do n't know much more than that . 
  because they are poorer in general . 
  turks do n't like to invest in the kurdish areas as there is constant instability there . 
  the pkk likes to keep people poor to be able to recruit easier . 
  unfortunately i agree with this .

  turkey fought isis , removed isis and all that you 're saying is speculation . 
  pulling out or delivering those guys . 
  there was also the offer of visiting them at another base in konya . 
  but i mean if turkey does not prove that those guys are guilty or not sufficiently i respect their decision . 
  but i do n't know why they thought that they could talk erdo\u011fan out of it , it was a waste of time . 
  i hope so , but being in nato does not mean that you cant have different opinions ( especially in non-nato missions , because it was not a nato mission up until the nato summit a few weeks ago ) . 
  you 're saying hostile , but ( as a turk i can tell ) its just his rhetorics aimed at domestic consumption . 
  how erdogan deals with germany or why is another story , because erdogan is erdogan . 
  i dont agree with it , but from his pov germany is keeping criminals/coup plotters and he wants them . 
  this guy is still acting like people do in the environment he grew up , if only you knew turkish and knew how he treats turkish opposition . 
  fighting isis was no nato mission up until a few weeks ago , so you argument is not really valid . 
  when nato went into war with serbia/yugoslavia greece decided not to , i dont recall anyone asking them to leave . 
  nato is afterall a defence alliance for the worst case scenarios , countries can have different views and if fighting isis means supporting apoists , well than thats against turkish interest . 
  and unlike germany turkey has been on the ground against isis , so spare me your commitment to fighting isis bs . 
   your entire post history is filled with turkey as much as mine is , i do n't see your point and i just returned home . 
  duh , i 'm turkish . 
  however i dont know whats motivating you . 
  democracy was directed at hungary , but you mean to tell me that hungary is irrelevant so let them be pro russian but when turkey does its not ? 
  cooperating with russia is vital for turkey in times of war at long stretches of its border . 
  if it suits turkish interests we might as well work with the iranians , you dont how to deal with any of it , neither are you offering any helping ( like military or taking in refugees ) . 
  working with russia is bringing stability step by step back to syria and less and less refugees for turkey . 
  where is the issue with that ? 
  we know how those alliances worked out in the past when poland was attacked . 
  i dont wish war on poland but you act like your superior or something . 
  so from an turkish pov what does it gain by having it there in first place if they support a terrorist organisation ( ypg ) fighting another ( isis ) ? 
  nothing , just lots of head ache and dead people in the future . 
  but from my pov that could have been dealt with before the german operaton even started . 
  but thats how erdogan politics work , everything and anything will be used when bargaining . 
  thats not really an accurate description of turkish-german cooperation . 
  both countries cooperated more than just `` strategic allies '' historically and economically in the past and present . 
  sure relations are probably at a low point , but germany dropping turkey ? 
  your entire post history is filled with turkey , armenia , greece and kurds . 
  you seem kinda obsessed , go get some fresh air . 
  i 'm not discussing shit with you , you probably expected so - because i 'm a turk . 
  so america and hungary for example are doing just fine democracy wise and russia wise ? 
  you are aware the americans cooperate with the russians in syria as does turkey and not mentioning the trump-russia connection or orban 's russian views . 
  when it comes to turkey its : kick turkey out of nato . 
  you are biased as fuck . 
  oh come on , save your comments for someone who cares about what you say and does not know you or your comment history . 
  but still you 're not the cradle of western civilization . 
  we 've been in nato for way longer than you were , were part of it when it actually mattered and approved your membership , always remember that xoxo, 
  we 're talking allies and nato . 
  not turkish domestic politics . 
  how the hell do you even keep finding my posts, 
  like poland is the holy grail of western civilization , you have a president that is erdogan-esque . 
  those `` some '' kurds are allied with the pkk , they are even part of the same organisation kck . 
  the krg ( barzanis party ) is hostile to the ypg as is turkey and enforcing an embargo to its territory . 
  kurds are not a monolithic group as some in the west want to believe . 
  got ta give france props for staying us free . 
  i was thinking of incirlik in turkey tbh . 
  just because the americans are allowed to use a base , that still does not make it an american base . 
  humongous what ? 
  he 's everywhere , wtf . 
  no , keep those nazis . 
  no dutch has been beaten thus far , the incident was largely exaggerated by the media in the netherlands and turkey be cause of the elections in both countries . 
  you know that 's probably not true and those orange stabbers have a very short memory anyway . 
  the only thing people from the tourism sector care about is money , nothing politics . 
  the second sentence is directed at your first comment . 
  i prefer not calling it that way , but yes way to many armenians have been killed in those dark days . 
  edit : but i dont really mean the first part . 
  was in tallinn around 10 years ago , great city , great people . 
  you hate us , cuz u anus / s. 
  in the same spirit : its a shame you 're independent for once . 
  must be someone from the turkish minority , right ? 
  did you just invent time traveling ? 
  my point was rather that turkey did shitty things and people mention it all the time , but forget the shitty things their people did . 
  especially here in this sub . 
  if france and germany can be buddies today , why not turks , greeks and the balkans . 
  instead we 're still stuck in the past . 
  i know many people still hold a grudge against arabs , but many ( mostly the religious people ) say that they were tricked and are still our `` bros '' . 
  animosity towards iran is a shia/sunni thing mostly and people being scared that iranian sharia might be exported to turkey . 
  i 'm not saying we 're better but i will call out bs when i see it and i 've seen a lot in here today . 
  i dont know to be honest , at least not for the people from the population exchange . 
  but i mean its 100 years ago , lets let history be history . 
  you can claim it , if it 's inactive . 
  but still no quote hombre ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  quote one . 
  open that sub to , might get a giggle out of it once in awhile . 
  some remarkable quoting skills you have right there . 
  totally not out of context and very accurate too . 
  i wouldnt mind a greek - western turkish federation if shit goes down . 
  i think its the same , but technically it was renamed way before it was named istanbul . 
  but from what i gathered most of the population called it constantinople . 
  show me something anti-kurdish i have said . 
  so did spain have a civil war with eta and the british with ira ? 
  because that is largely ignored unlike the suffering of the greeks or anybody else involved . 
  that 's why . 
  and i like to mention it here and there when people act like saints in here when they have some dirty laundry too . 
  my family for example was from i believe rhodes and has never been compensated for the property that was lost . 
   you came , you opressed people and you filled us with settlers who opressed us as well , what did you expect to happen after we achieved our independence ? 
  so are you better , worse or the same as the ottomans ? 
  all these flavours and you choose to be salty . 
  the moment greece takes over any part of turkey it will become majority turkish . 
  that would be anschluss from the inside . 
  its official name has been konstaniniyye since 1453 . 
  i was making fun out of your stupid comment , but you 're to dense to get that . 
  unlike you , we turks take pride in our different origins . 
  we have tons of people from the balkans that were displaced by force by the same people that whine and complain to this day . 
  but guess what we moved on and we 're developing cant say the same about the majority of the balkans or heck greece without all the scammed eu money . 
  i see you try to use the same argument again and again .

  pkk has no reason to keep terrorising . 
  no shit ?!, 
  they didnt receive any aid however erdogan didnt stop them either . 
  his policy was dont touch , dont die . 
  your country wont have a terrorist organization now but if you had you 'd know how it hurts to have one . 
  if turkey really did collaborated with isis it was top officials of mit ( intelligence agency of turkey ) not your random police officer and you have no right to kill a guy . 
  they are just looking for reasons to kill as seen by when they called cops for a traffic accident and then killed one of them and heavily wounded the other one . 
  it is unbelievable how you guys can whitewash pkk 's actions . 
  i dont want to but i sometimes hope one day pkk hits you hard too . 
  maybe only that way you can realise they are not peace angels . 
  you know that pkk is a terrorist group right ? 
  who killed 2 police officers in their home and another one with a fake call and kidnapped an ambulance and its staff in it ? 
  but all you say is ... turkey ... despicable ? 
  we will deploy our immigrants first . 
  yours can wait , your country can handle . 
   were accused of working with isis with no f ****** proof !, 
  skilled people make their way into better eu countries where we ( poor balkan countries in general ) get stuck with beggars , thiefs and rapists ... 
  yea but in 1916 ottomans were not controlling that much of caucaus . 
  i mean thats wow !, 
  just look at it !, 
  a very interesting map for turkey . 
  a slight lost on eastern thrace and a strip of aegean coast but controlling whole middle east and caucaus, 
  religion masking hate and greed and not actually the source of it ? 
  hahahaha !, 
  i really dont understand this . 
  i just heard a year ago that a church `` opened for business '' in kadikoy , istanbul . 
  i am sure churches increased in number throughout history of turkey . 
  maybe not news were built but the olds were restorated but still churches increased in number . 
  unfortunately there is not high non muslim population to maintain them . 
  for example a synagogue in istanbul has one worshipper who opens and closes the building i do want turkey to give more importance to religion except islam . 
  old ? 
  so what ? 
  many things in istanbul is old . 
  it is an old city you know . 
  an old church would be more favorable and worthful than a new one . 
  yea . 
  wish i had the power to swipe away religion . 
  nope at a bar that would be around 4 $, 
  you are either an idiot who is misleaded or someone who knows the deal but simply plays with it so it fits the anti-turkish narrative . 
  either way i wont argue with you . 
  since you wont change your opinion . 
  you are either an idiot who is misleaded or someone who knows the deal but simply plays with it so it fits the anti-turkish narrative . 
  either way i wont argue with you . 
  since you wont change your opinion . 
  there is no law that forbids such thing . 
  there are many churches in istanbul . 
  if romanian church was necessary it would be constructed . 
  though i agree this said mosque is completely useless . 
  omg wish there was turkey in the list . 
  it would be funny to see reds everywhere ... 
  the answer for turkey is like 2-2 .5 $ for a 50cl bottle . 
  hats ? 
  yea a country born from ashes . 
  at least better than what sevres would impose on us . 
  i wonder what would happen if we had completely lost our independence war . 
  i was thinking for the latter since division of poland was in an instant . 
  it didnt take time to `` burn '', 
  people trying to grab whatever they can from a burning house . 
  yea !, 
  wtf / r/europe ? 
  those countries are not certainly in the glorious europe !, 
  surprised ? 
  i thought / r/europe puts us in africa !, 
  greek genocide is controversial . 
  it includes great fire of smyrna but that fire was done by greeks whose priests were preaching it was gods will . 
  even though erdogan controlled pretty much everything even his power was not enough to completely dominate the highest court on turkey ( court of constitution ) because of some pesky democratic laws we have . 
  thats why he was calling for a new constitution to assert total dominance but he needed 400 out of 550 mps in the grand assembly but he even failed to make the majority in the recent elections by taking only 258 mps . 
  doom is coming for erdogan . 
  he will be judged by the only court he hasnt infiltrated yet in the end no matter what . 
  whats hot potato ? 
  and erdogan 's party lost hahah . 
  he should stay quiet . 
  wait . 
  we arent the worst in balkans ? 
  yea . 
  because turkey = north korea, 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  lol . 
  and how this would be horrible ? 
  what would a golden dawn government do ? 
  eu will become a federation once turkey joins it . 
  yea . 
  what i was thinking . 
  turkish stream has potential . 
  how did the turkish stream came to a dead end ? 
  he didnt `` kill '' minorities . 
  he did start turkification of the area . 
  this was a must . 
  a country like turkey full with lots of different ethnicities in time when faschism was on rise . 
  you can get mad at him for turkifying the area i dont care . 
  but if he hadnt . 
  then all those minorities would be rising up and fragile ( at that time ) turkey would be drawn into a civil war which would only make great powers happy . 
  lmao . 
  `` his nationalities '' he was nothing before gallipoli campaign . 
  had no power to do anything . 
  yet people find something to shit on him . 
  there were literally no armenians left when he came to power . 
  he had called the armenian genocide a shameful act . 
  in a very fragile country like early turkey he aimed to build a nation state so yea he did oppress minorities but it was nothing compared to what 80 coup d etat did to minorities . 
  so let me repeat he had no power to stop any massacre .

  you mean hordes ? 
  they are white or christian . 
  it 's just a version of the name different abrahamic religions use for some odd reason . 
  yeah , alexander is the christian name for \u0130skender i think . 
  like abraham/ibrahim , moses/musa , michael/mikhail , david/davud and so on . 
  eh , i just do n't like the real this that attitude . 
  yeah , some people are stupid and we are frustrated , we should still keep it calm as much as we can . 
   real turks lolwut i notice your comments are gradually getting more rude and classless , not cool man . 
  i really do n't , elaborate . 
   same problem there except not really noticable because french people are assholes unless they want your money . 
  oh man , you love your stereotypes do n't you ? 
  yeah , what is white ? 
  caucasian is a term invented by a racist german pseudoscientist and is sadly used by americans . 
   in his earlier racial typology , meiners put forth that caucasians had the `` whitest , most blooming and most delicate skin '' . 
  europeans with darker skin he considered `` dirty whites '' , admixed with mongolian . 
  such views were typical of early scientific attempts at racial classification ,, 
  have you ever traveled in and outside of the country ? 
  i presume you have . 
  alright , you live in a shitty place , that does n't make all turks identical to those who live in that place , you should know that as a good and civilised white person , no ? 
  we get horrible dutch people here too , does n't mean every dutch person is a 24/7 drunkard who vomits in the middle of the street everyday and yells obscenities at 03:00 . 
  but yeah , we really did send our uneducated population there after ww2 . 
  what does white person mean anyway ? 
  i was genuinely asking if you experienced trauma by a turkish person . 
  i 've heard this multiple times even in / r/offmychest titled `` i hate turkish people because my stepdad is turkish and does n't visit me often '' , the replies ? 
  `` oh honey i understand totally normal ! '' . 
  but i digress , this also happens with black people in the us and such , someone gets their relative raped and suffers from some sort of delusion . 
  anything of that sort going on with you ? 
  i 'm trying to be as polite as possible mind you , most people do not tolerate this stuff and it is hate speech and i would like to scalp you in real life . 
  elaborate & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
   yeah , pretty much . 
  i never said europeans were the good guys . 
  but if we were bad we were the best at being bad . 
  alright , why you whining about ottomans treating christians badly then ? 
  remember we did n't discriminate by something unchangeable like nationality until the 19th century which was disastrous for everyone in the region . 
  we discriminated by religion which if people did n't have their pride stuck so far up their ass they would 've simply converted . 
   romans are romanticized because there 's a reason for them to be . 
  a society vastly superior to anyone who lived in their time , a society of harsh justice , discipline and precision . 
  a people who basically shaped the world into what it is today , together with the greeks . 
  that 's ... that 's kinda fascist . 
   ottoman military bands are thought to be the oldest variety of military marching band in the world , dating from the 13th century . 
   11th century book div\u00e2nu l\u00fcgati ` t-t\u00fcrk mentions prototype of mehtaran , turkish military band tradition . 
  bands were formed by soldiers . 
  17th century traveler evliya \u00c7elebi noted that the ottoman empire had 40 guilds of musicians in 1670 's istanbul . 
  ottoman military bands influenced european equivalents -  the europeans and arabs obtained firearms in the 14th century the turks , iranians , and indians all had firearms no later than the 15th century , in each case directly or indirectly from the europeans . 
  -  basically if you 've done anything good for us it 's by screwing us over . 
  like you know you bully a kid at school for being fat and eventually he loses weight . 
  you 're still a douche . 
  and his prosperity helped him go further because he had to deal with the douche . 
  dat victim complex  you mean by torturing and murdering all the romans of the eastern roman empire so they had to flee to italy and inspire the renaissance ? 
  i said indirectly for a reason mate . 
   just no . 
  it was actually europeans who made cannons for you thanks to which you took constantinopole . 
  like how you enslaved natives of americas and black people and had them do your shit for you and fuck the rest of the world gradually ? 
  i do n't even know why i 'm arguing with this guy : i, 
  * only the master race . 
   istanbul was the greek word for `` the city '' which is what the greeks called constantinople . 
  the city in greek is sthn poli which the turks thought was the actual name of the city , fun fact of the day !, 
   true but istanbul was officially the name after the republic because `` they wanted to distance themselves from the ottoman empire '' . 
  konstantiniyye was used before that i reckon . 
  like how alexandria was not changed ( it 's \u0130skenderiye in turkish ) . 
  lol colonialism rome also assimilated and massacred their way into success , but they are ridiculously romanticized ( ha ) so it 's ok . by the way we ( indirectly ) helped kick off the renaissance and the discovery of the new world , modern musical instruments , firearms and such have been introduced to europe with turkish assistance . 
  it 's unhelpful to say `` we 'd have gotten them anyway and skullfucked the rest of the world side ways hehe '' but we really do n't know what turn history would take without us , so shut it . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ % 100 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ correct ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ know, 
  this is good , we are trying to get rid of the peasant population . 
  we 've been successful so far * rubs hands * . 
  do n't bother with / u/divideetimpera8 , he literally has no idea what he 's talking about . 
  he has a very simplistic view of the world . 
  he said that `` turks have an oriental culture '' then changed it to `` turks have a middle eastern culture '' then said western is just another way to say european . 
  called me a shitty person and a dumbass ( dae appropriate name lelelexdxdxd ??? ), 
  plus he thinks europe is an actual continent . 
  i 'd say we 're neither western nor eastern or whatever , we 've got our own thing going on like most countries , which is why it 's not accurate to say it 's this or that . 
  damn , that is some strong hate . 
  trauma from a turk or something ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ that 's ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ joke . 
  * the gdp though ... *, 
  profiting off delusional people * dude has a media empire along with the countless juicy contracts for his spineless `` friends '' and family and is literally seen as the caliph by some idiots . 
  awesome . 
  i think we need to leave cyprus as soon as possible provided cyprus is not a greek-orthodox state ( i think it should be secular and for all peoples but i think the cypriots ' got this covered ) . 
  these kinds of things will only distance us . 
  although we did need to intervene in the military lunacy & attempted attacks at minorities in the difficult and recent times of the cold war , we did n't know when to stop . 
  we should 've just made sure that everything was fine and dandy and collaborated with the west . 
   ~ ~ human ~ ~ peasant life is cheap in turkey . 
  ha , you impoverished your lands while enriching mine !, 
  so we went from 972 years to 982 , shit . 
  i agree with the first comment , the second one 's a sarcastic/joke . 
  turkish nationals ? 
  you mean turks ? 
  we certainly do feel like we are treated unfairly . 
  you can say `` nah , you are idiots just pay pls '' or you might try to understand why we feel that way . 
  i think the former is what most europeans will consider first . 
  so where does this end ? 
  when will they stop pushing us around ? 
  pay this !, 
  pay reparations that !, 
  oh you even remotely disagree ? 
  fuck right off then !, 
  we are only ordered to pay because we ca n't enforce our interests , most western nations stepped in deeper shit . 
  this is a great way to ruin reunification efforts i 'll give them that . 
  i agree with that but be careful about categorizing things like that . 
  we also have our regions that are reasonable and crazy ( from our point of view of course ) .

  lies . 
  this is our national pastime . 
  plus , why are blonde people not a race ? 
  blondoids ? 
  or people with curly hair ? 
  so ridiculous . 
  have you read that ? 
  it only says it 's a `` possibility '' . 
  even israel 's alleged ethno-bomb was deemed a hoax . 
  haha , suckers . 
  everyone knows you 're supposed to discriminate against romas . 
  does this have any relation to `` mongol '' ? 
  except this guy giggles like a little bitch while idi amin has a jolly belly laugh . 
  alright , here 's a really unpopular opinion ; there are a lot of unnecessary european countries . 
  for example austria should be absorbed by germany , belarus by russia , sweden-norway-denmark should be combined into a single country ( i do n't believe there is ethnic hatred between them to the point of violent conflict ) and such . 
  hey , stray dogs are pretty cool . 
  they make the place more tolerable here . 
  you can say black . 
  `` hi , / r/whiterights123 here , and please pay attention to our deranged ramblings ! '', 
  why is it something to be thankful for though ? 
  i have n't seen contractors get thanked , ever . 
  not really surprising , casual homophobia is pretty common around the world . 
  we hate them for their freedoms . 
  they think `` it 's a nice thing to say '' . 
  why they do n't say it to literally any other profession is beyond me . 
  `` thank you for taking my order ! '', 
  thank you !!!, 
  nope , none of that . 
  about time , let 's dust off our imperialism engines and rock . 
  i think he means dismantling israel 's government . 
  i would n't mind if that whole area was simply called `` the holy land '' with a secular/abrahamic constitution that is neither jewish or arab . 
  we could cut some tension here and there . 
  that way everyone will get to stay and are free to go in or out . 
  eehhh , he 's just some confused ultra-nationalist . 
  been there , done that . 
  he just ** loathes ** muslims because he sees them as the antithesis of his in-group . 
  i guarantee you he 's insecure inside . 
  interesting that he 's so egoistical though , he called me a savage eastern barbarian ( yup ) but when his original account , neutralgreek was banned he said it was the fault of everyone else , not that he was an insufferable cunt . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ internet ^ ^ ^ ^ psychoanalyst ^ ^ ^ ^ out, 
  it 's really just whatever fits your argument at the time . 
  dude was abused by his parents , got plastic surgery , used steroids and played cod `` to train '' . 
  what a fucking joke of a man . 
  so much for being an \u00fcbermensch . 
  his messiah complex would be interesting if he did n't murder dozens though . 
  no no , they wanted white people freed . 
  did n't matter what nationality they were . 
  i was just giving an another example for him but i guess mine hit a nerve . 
  i understand the irony but not europe . 
  it means vaguely being slav-ish-y . 
  why would it be demeaning/racist/funny though ? 
  it 's probably some soviet sympathizer , do n't the west have these guys everywhere ? 
  likewise , friend . 
  civilized and savage are both ** heavily ** linked to 19th century racism so to say . 
  it 's naive to think this was anything different . 
  ] ( http://www.docstoc.com/docs/8303274/the-israel-projects-2009-global-language-dictionary ), 
  also bizarre how europeans demanded the ottoman empire that it free all white slaves and make it illegal to enslave white people . 
  blacks were fair game . 
  i do n't get the photo ... 
  i am always impressed with my pathetic life when i manage to piss someone off to that degree . 
  [ especially posting this , i had many people raging after watching this . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=pfsvcqbybgy#t=68 ), 
  if you think this is only about gaza you 're not seeing the whole picture at best and willfully misinterpreting at worst . 
  it 's clearly implied . 
  but then we go to even worse areas , how violent/sexual does it have to be to be illegal ? 
  where is the line ? 
  but it 's supposedly on a public bus so it might . 
  what i 'm saying is violence or sexuality etc does n't offend me and i assume a lot of people as well but they are banned either way . 
  it 'll be the rejected if it offends certain people , got it . 
  so people can put literally anything they want there as long as they have the money ? 
  the american way . 
  that hotel probably had irish terrorists in it . 
  it 's ok . 
  i do n't know , hate speech ? 
  you think everything would be dandy if people saw `` help the oppressed , not the dirty lying jews !, 
  seemed like they were just being childish to me . 
  hard not to be when you have mother west spoonfeeding you everything i guess . 
  i do n't even know how that horseshit got approved or nobody got sued over it . 
  it is largely agreed that it is `` because of western tradition '' . 
  have you watched the entire thing ? 
  she literally went there and saw how they were living . 
  now it 's not seeing it but living with them . 
  if she had roma neighbors you would switch to `` i 'm talking about the real roma !, 
  she was lucky ! '', 
  also i do n't get this , we 've got 500,000 roma and we 've had absolutely no problems with them , ever . 
  this is exclusively a european problem . 
  maybe , just maybe not everything is their fault . 
  reminds me of the `` help the civilized man , not the savage ! '', 
  propaganda in america . 
  also nearly a million iraqi deaths . 
  no moment of silence or a nice sad looking snoo logo for those guys . 
  i do n't , we disagree . 
  you went from being skeptical of their racism to saying it 's fine . 
  something 's off . 
   i think anti-nationalism is inherently bad because it is inherently predicated on morality from intellectuals and not from the people . 
  really ? 
  what makes postnationalism itself any of that ? 
  are you saying `` the people '' ca n't be postnationalists ? 
  anyways , i do n't even know why i 'm arguing you 2 weeks after i made the op . 
  address the entire post . 
  because their concept of ethnicity is their skin colour and they most likely want to get away from blacks that they do n't like much let 's say .

yes , i have been there too and gjikorester ? 
  they both were very beautiful . 
  should n't ... 
  almost 68 percent ( 9 percent do n't have an idea ) of population do n't want to join eu but our politicians are still running after eu . 
  erdogan is using eu politics for increasing xenophobia in the country and getting more supporters with that . 
  ( that was what he has done against holland and germany before elections recently ) turkey is located europe . 
  ( or somewhere like that . 
  i am not even sure where is that anymore . 
  so many rumours . 
  some people tell it 's in asia . 
  some tell it 's in mena , some tell it 's in europe , some tell it 's in middle east , some tells it 's just a bridge ... 
  but we are not european and we wo n't be ... 
  neither we will be an arab country . 
  there is a serious culture difference between european countries and turkey . 
  if eu accepts turkey to union , there will be a serious immigration from turkey to europe and that will change demographics of countries . 
  many of us do n't want syrians in turkey with similar reasons . 
  vlore was quite nice place and i also like kruje much . 
  there are many nice cities like that . 
  i did n't like tirana much though . 
  i do n't know why tourism has n't developed in albania . 
  there is a great potential of the country . 
  the problem is 68 percent of turkey population ( 9 percent has no idea ) do n't already want to join eu ( and stop negotiations with eu ) with 2016 statistics . 
  erdogan 's men do n't know what they want really . 
  edit : actually they do ... 
  they use eu membership issues for their xenophobic politics . 
  some albanians, 
  you need an umbrella . 
  pfft . 
  what 's your purpose with love them all ? 
  we owe them ... 
  if they were n't exist , we could n't be here ... or somewhere else . 
  yeah ... 
  written with fu ` lan prosody . 
  that makes sense now . 
  generally we do n't change arabic words that comes into turkish or only small changes . 
  however still turkish got it from french though . 
  this is the official webpage of turkish language association : http://www.tdk.gov.tr/index.php?option=com_gts&amp;kelime=ma%c4%9eaza, 
  a small clarification . 
  somehow i sensed that there is an opinion that turkish loanword in persian too much . 
  that 's wrong . 
  persian is only about 0,05 % in turkish . 
  arabic is 3 % and french is 3 % . 
  there is 500 greek words in turkish . 
  1 word from albanian . 
  30 words from slavic languages . 
  i believe there should be some romanian words but can not recall atm . 
  yeah , do n't poke the snake . 
  meydan is also originally arabic . 
  actually magaza or magasin or magatzem is in 100 % french origin and we got it from french language . 
  most of other countries too . 
  magaza is already is not a word which suits to arabic . 
  huge differences between east and west . 
  unfortunately turkish business men and politicians always invested western side of the country . 
  even before pkk terror has started . 
  actually this was one of reasons of the terror . 
  additionally people did n't want to work in east . 
  people couldnt find doctors in hospitals , there were no teachers at schools . 
  there were no water at some locations for years . 
  so the east regions remained undeveloped , uneducated and unhealthy . 
  we never want to admit it ourselves but we left them to face their own destiny without helping them . 
  now some people from west humiliate easteners ( most of them kurdish ppl ) with being uneducated and savage . 
  australia ? 
  i wanted but could n't . 
  i have been in perth . 
  then i understood i am not a type of person who can live in abroad . 
  i had many friends in melbourne with turkish and irish origin . 
  if i could move there may be things would be different . 
  in my opinion if you are skilled , australia was the best place i have seen for a foreigner though . 
  ( opportunities , jobs , freedom , lifestyle , social and friendly people ) they made me sing a song which i can not recall now . 
  lol . 
  i am , you are , we are australian ? 
  i have been in europe for only business . 
  agreed, 
  yes , they ( and the location ) is very famous in turkey and a good place for vacation . 
  hehe . 
  baklava then !, 
  you know i was kidding :d, 
  hehe . 
  thank you bunch  i already feel the same , 
  i already do n't like him and i thought it is not even worth to mention about him though . 
  they are not too much . 
  they have just a village in turkey . 
  yes i found a small information , i am still looking for it though . 
  according to turkish resource that i have found : kars ( a city in turkey ) has been captured by russian forces in those years . 
  a little estonian group have been forced to migrate to kars from prussia by russian forces and they have created a village for themselves there . 
  now it is called karaca\u00f6ren . 
  it seems i have met all people in the ethnic list of turkey but only one . 
  that group has surprised me . 
  i did n't even know they even exist in turkey : estonians . 
  yes ... no :p, 
  pfft . 
  i recommend you to try australia or nz nowadays instead of europe . 
  turkish : https://eksisozluk.com/ https://www.uludagsozluk.com/, 
  norway & sweden `` fjord & ice hotel tour '', 
  i do n't think turkey will ever have similar culture & economic values with europeans . 
  i am thinking good of both sides ( eu & turkey ) about that . 
  turkey is a large country which still pays back what ottomans have done in collapse age . 
  turkey 's industrialization is better than most of eu countries but it 's limited with some parts of turkey . 
  if you have seen differences between eastern and western parts of turkey , you could understand what i mean . 
  i believe a eu country 's rate of development should be similar for each part of the country .

  it 's gon na end well ( ! ), 
  - composition-wise : russia ( if it counts in europe ) - lyrics-wise : turkey ( if it counts in europe ), 
  meat is expensive in turkey ( always has been ) . 
  people just buy whatever is the cheapest regardless of its country of origin . 
   mr. kramarz said that it often costs 3,000 euros , wow , that 's scandinavian level of rip off, 
  stanhope is the most depressing and dark humoured comedian i know of ... i absolutely love his stand-up shows . 
   `` hh '' and `` wi '' drivers are scary , but i think thats because europcar and avis register all their cars under these respectively . 
  i dont know wi drivers but hh ones were quite aggressive . 
  and here i am sitting and thinking how much jet fuel was burnt . 
  shit is expensive . 
  but disused i presume . 
  well , unless you talk to royalty , 
  in turkish it 's same as german : sen ( du ) -- polite --  siz ( sie ) imperatives can also be `` softened '' : - yap ( do ) - yapin ( please do ) - yapiniz ( my dear sweet pie with cherry on top could you please do if it is not such a bother for you ) we also use a lot of honorifics . 
  i wish we dropped 'em all and just be like the danes where everyone use their name regardless of their position . 
  but oh no no no , we have to keep the redundancy . 
  just because . 
  traditionally/historically wolf ( gray wolf to be more specific ) is the animal of turks . 
  it 's tied to many myths and legends . 
  i think it 's because it 's a pack animal that symbolizes unity and hierarchy . 
  but today if i had to pick an animal that represents turkey it would be sheep ( or penguin to a lesser extent ) . 
  they 're also cute , 
  i 've heard that in germany when people see a car from a different region holding up the traffic or other mildly annoying stuff , they get patient because they know it ai n't from around there . 
  there are 81 of them in turkey and you usually know the codes of big cities and neighbouring provinces . 
  also many dads know them by heart , 
  he also [ ** really ** ] ( https://www.itusozluk.com/image/ahmet-davutoglu-nun-kahvalti-sofrasi_522074.jpg ) likes his breakfast . 
  motherfucker eats as much as the annual agricultural products of zimbabwe . 
  anywhere east of ankara . 
  yeah sure . 
  i mean whatever floats your ~ ~ boat ~ ~ welfare :p, 
  then maybe the government will decrease your world infamous car taxes, 
   my own view of christania is mixed . 
  i 'm generally in favor of having a vibrant alternative community in the heart of the capital , but the way current resident are so exclusive about who gets to live there is disturbing . 
  essentially , the only way to get to live in christiania is either through birth or willingness to sleep with old hippies . 
  that 's only so much `` anarchy '' for one  also i do n't think anyone is lining up to live there . 
  regardless , what i wonder is : do pushers pay tax ? 
  who else are they gon na sell to ? 
  of course they sell it to those `` abuser '' countries . 
  they do the actual killing and in actual need of weapons . 
  that 's what weapons are for ... to kill . 
  if those human rights abusers could manufacture their own believe me they would . 
  sometimes reporters seem to have barnacle for brain . 
  it 's sad to hear that some people here believe that turkey should or does indeed follow a turanist ( pan-turkic ) union ideology . 
  this is delusional and ended with a catastrophe when that retard * enver pa\u015fa * who pushed ottoman empire into ww1 . 
  after fucking up he still continued on his delusions of grandeur and was finally mowed down by a gatling gun in turkestan autonomous soviet republic . 
  today , those turkic republics are russian satellites and ** all ** of them are extremely corrupt and oppressive . 
  so , puh-lease !, 
  oh also , in those republics the locals really do n't like turkey turks . 
  thanks to all the swindling turkish businessmen went there after the collapse of ussr . 
  i 've been to kazakstan , azerbaijan and turkmenistan . 
  go see for yourselves . 
  you 'll kiss the ground when you come back to turkey , let alone a fantasy union . 
  whether the europeans or us like it or not we are bound together . 
  germany is our # 1 export partner , 95 % of our trade with eu is industrial ( and this was back in 2009 ) , we have many relatives , friends and loved ones that live within eu . 
  just because eu membership is not a reality for turkey that does n't mean there are no other alternatives for cooperation . 
  there can be some minor steps made to ease the relation . 
  okay , do n't give turks free travel but at least make getting visas easier and free of charge for researchers , students and tourists etc. 
  that are obvious will not stay there and `` take your jobs away '' . 
  try to include us in your nice schemes like no roaming charges . 
  stuff like these ( of course not with the current tayyip regime . 
  we have plunged in all human rights , democracy , freedom of press , censorship etc. 
  statistics since that fucktard came to power ), 
  and i do n't see eu ever wanting to neighbor syria , iraq , armenia , georgia , iran and giving turks the # 2 majority in the european parliament anytime soon even if by some cosmic chance turkey got to the contemporaneous level of western europe . 
  turkey 's goal of full eu membership is delusional . 
  they should make a * good * privileged partnership deal . 
  not a shitty deal like the customs union that was made in 1996 . 
  one has to applaud the persistence of turkey ( but jeer at the incompetency of not fulfilling acquis chapters ) . 
  has been a candidate since 1959 . that 's 55 years and counting .

  i read this theory in several places but i do n't know how true it is ( probably is n't ) : profits from gog.com helps them keep afloat . 
  so they do n't much care about the common denominator thus they do n't dumb down their games .

  i wonder what `` cd '' in cd projekt stands for .

  horrible to make much sense out of it . 
  does this include the driver school cost ?

  good ol' outhouse, 
  roaming need not be expensive . 
  when you are in another country you still use the [ local operator ] ( http://i.imgur.com/atswdyv.jpg ) , i.e the voice signal ( same for data i assume ) goes thru the local network . 
  so far it has been expensive because of the deals your provider needs to make with gazillion of companies in every country . 
  if those contracts can be simplified within eu there is no reason to get fucked with exorbitant prices . 
  and it 's gon na happen , 
  whats wrong with eu ?

  yeah , good luck just disregarding the fact that many politicians are heavily lobbied by large tax ~ ~ evading ~ ~ avoiding corporations for a moment here ... there are giant corps like kpmg , deloitte , pwc etc. 
  who run this scheme and also countries like cyprus , malta , ireland , luxembourg etc. 
  depend on this whole tax haven deal . 
  yeah , you can see that i am not that optimistic .

  evren is already undead ^ brainnnsssss,

   b ) shopping in northern germany only if you live in jylland .

  i mean if not wanting to murder them counts as a pro-lgbt sure he is but he would never bring same-sex marriage or protective rights to them . 
  look i am against death penalty but could europe stop using the eu accession card ? 
  we are not getting in regardless whether we have death penalty or not . 
   `` freedom for ocalan '' , referring to abdullah ocalan , the jailed leader of the militant kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) , with many waving flags featuring ocalan 's face . 
  i though apo 's face was banned in germany was that fake news ? 
  it is also stupid to call this an `` protest against erdogan '' when they are asking for the release of a terrorist leader . 
  this is just an obvious generic pkk rally hidden in guise of being against erdogan 's authoritarianism ... 
  they are taking advantage of current anti-erdogan stance europe has to push their agenda . 
  but the biggest group of people is furthest away from the stop . 
  man this is bizarre . 
  where does even bus stop ? 
  well just checked and you are right . 
  they still have legal problems though . 
  g\u00fclen not being behind it does not mean it is not gulenists who did it also calling gulenists a `` civil organisation '' is enough to not take someone seriously imo . 
  they are basically scientology on steroids and germany banned scientology but gulenists are fine for some reason ? 
   `` leader of the free world '' could we stop that . 
  i did n't realize we were talking about decent people here . 
  do n't see erdogan saying people to attack anyone as well . 
  the goal it to make your opponent use violence not you . 
  it is basic right-wing populist stuff . 
  i swear those tv dating shows are awful . 
  the fact that they are so popular really makes me cringe . 
  none actually . 
  satirists have it a lot better than journalists however they still get sued time to time . 
  they get hit time to time mainly for insulting religion but just pay a fine and continue doing it . 
  they are careful about not making comics that 'll land them in jail . 
  they used to get in by entering as independent candidates . 
  independents does not need to pass a threshold so as long as they won somewhere in the country they 'll get in to parliment . 
  kurds roughly make of % 15 of the county so they barely managed to squeeze in with % 10,7 of the votes in the last elections . 
  it was the first time kurds managed to enter the parliament as a party . 
  erdogan was right all along . 
  actually that 's because of the ridiclous threshold we got here which is % 10 for parties . 
  ldp would still get some votes if people believed that their votes will not go to waste . 
  he probably does n't want the lose the support of turkish goverment . 
  when your voters consists of people who support erdogan it is not a good idea to publicly condemn his statements . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_constitutional_referendum,_2017#opinion_polls sadly just after he started that dispute with netherlands polls started favoring him again ... 
  eh not really he is the guy who started peace process not too long ago % 90 kurds in turkey was voting for him . 
  he only dropped it because hdp came along and stole his kurdish voters . 
  erdogan is not a nationalist he is an islamist he does n't mind giving kurds what they wants . 
  you are correct ofc but we know moralism only goes so far otherwise western countries would n't keep dealing with suadi arabia . 
  assad being a ruthless dictator certainly makes harder for eu to back them but they would if sdf did n't exist to fight isis . 
  another atrocity from nazi dutch . 
  as a warrior of justice president erdogan will stop these fiends . 
  here 's my [ reasoning ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5zcte0/turkey_vows_to_mobilize_islamic_world_against/dex8hw0/ ) . 
  there are 2 major parties in iraqi kurdistan . 
  puk and kdp . 
  kdp is the party that 's currently in power however in 1994 there was civil war between the two parties and pkk decided to back puk which lead to turkey intervening and siding with kdp . 
  because of this kdp is thankful to turkey and ally of us while being against pkk . 
  because of their stance to pkk . 
  basically pkk is a kurdish separatist terrorist organization from turkey . 
  they aided to syrian kurds agaist their fight with isis and basically allies with each other which is very bad for turkey because this means pkk can build camps in syrian kurdistan and conduct attacks on turkey without the fear of prosecution so turkey attacks syrian kurds to force them to abandon pkk while iraqi kurdistan 's current goverment is anti-pkk and even aids turkey 's fight against pkk . 
  no turkey is attacking syrian kurds . 
  iraqi kurdistan is quite close to turkey . 
  i swear i am answering this question for 3 . time . 
  i believe he should be prosecuted but putting him to jail would be pointless . 
  you are correct however it is kdp that holds the most power so in the end we can basically say turkey is an ally of iraqi kurdistan otherwise turkey also has several opposition parties that essentially make up half of the parliament that are not friend of say suadi arabia . 
  btw gorran is not exactly anti-turkey they are mix of both puk and kdp . 
  hard to predict but based on the [ current situation ] ( http://syriancivilwarmap.com/ ) syrian goverment will most likely get back all the parts of syria that 's currently occupied by isis . 
  kurds will keep most of the yellow area they however might leave some part to syrian goverment . 
  the rebels can not advance anymore however i highly doubt they 'll lose idlib . 
  the rebel pockets will most likely closed though by negotiations inexcheange of their safe passage to idlib . 
  and lastly the turkish occupied area will most likely stay under occupation for quite sime time . 
  they never would . 
  assad is too close to russia to get any support from eu . 
  i think he stopped caring about public image long ago as long as he can secure his place as dictator in turkey he 'll be fine . 
  no barzani and erdogan are literally best bros. . kurds are not united . 
  iraqi kurdistan is ally of turkey . 
  syrian kurdistan is not . 
  i mean by facebook standards just including the n word in your comment will get your post deleted regardless of context . 
  i experienced it first hand so saying i hate jews would certainly get your post removed if is reported . 
  no turkey is attacking [ ypg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/people's_protection_units ) . 
  iraqi kurdistan goverment is close allies of akp . 
  [ peshmarga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peshmerga ) is army of iraqi kurds not syrian kurds turkey is not fighting them . 
  well it is unlikely for rebels to win however it is also unlikely for syrian goverment to be able to take remaining rebel strongholds like idlib . 
  syria will most likely split in to three . 
  referendum is coming the polls show `` no '' is winning . 
  erdogan is desperate he is trying to provoke europe so they would make public statements supportive of no voters which then he 'll use it as propaganda by saying `` europeans does n't want the referendum pass because they do n't want a strong turkey ! '' . 
  and it is already working we started getting articles from western media about referendum very heavily favoring no vote that was basically nonexistent 2 days ago despite the referendum date being declared months ago . 
  anyway erdogan always makes up with countries he starts dispute with someway like he did with russia and isreal i suspect he thinks he can to do it with dutch as well . 
  currently suadi arabia , iraqi kurdistan , qatar , palastine , kuwait , pakistan and lebanon . 
  syria might become one too if rebels win the civil war . 
  basically every middle-eastern country that 's not iran 's allies plus egypt . 
  if you think it is only erdogan supporters who hate pkk terrorists you are severely mistaken or very uninformed . 
  well at least this one is more logical than calling the dutch nazis . 
  i think erdogan just found out about google . 
  it was hard to take nazi comments seriously but dutch will certainly will be offended this time . 
  yes but they still exist as he just listed . 
  dude people are whining about us all the time not sure what you are talking about and french president is not like erdogan . 
  if they ever elect a maniac like us they would be all around news too . 
  because they do . 
  you guys overestimate erdogan 's power . 
  he is doing the referandum to get power without using loopholes all the time in the first place . 
  if he did not care about the result he would n't lose his shit over polls favoring no and would n't have made up a stupid dispute with dutch . 
  while elections in turkey are not fair since erdogan has control over media and prevents the opposition from campaigning as much as possible the elections itself are real . 
  if it indeed turns out to be no his hands will be basically tied and it 'll give the confidence the opposition parties desperately needs . 
  please nazis have [ types ] ( https://i.redd.it/e8lm5jocm8ly.jpg ) . 
  with this simple retarded logic . 
  `` pkk , europe etc wants the referendum to not pass so if it passes it must be good for us ! '', 
  this is what happens when politics turn from trying to improve your nation to showing the opposition who 's boss . 
  i would n't worry much knowing erdogan this stupid crises will end in a few days .
