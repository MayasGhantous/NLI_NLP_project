  edit : added more backstory, 
  i found you guys through / r/empiredidnothingwrong, 
  will corporal oveanth be assigned to a squad ? 
  * corporal oveanth walks in , with his trusty standard issue e11 , he finds an open spot and begins shooting , missing a few shots , and landing a few *, 
  `` god dammit , god i suck at shooting , would it kill requisitions to give me a helmet that actually works for once ? , the eyes get so foggy ! '', 
  thanks, 
  `` who the hel -- '' * he stops mid sentence , when he turns around and see 's the identifying features of a lieutenant *, 
  `` sir , i did n't see you , please excuse my language , i 've just been recently transferred to lieutenant typherrius 's squad , but i 'm not familiar with anyone on the ship . 
  if i may ask , who is yannick ? '', 
  * he immediately stands at attention * `` corporal oveanth reporting sir '', 
  `` yes sir ! '', 
  `` sir , what are my orders ? '', 
  `` yes , sir '' * corporal oveanth walks out to try and find the armoury *, 
  `` sir , we have n't been briefed in yet ! '', 
  `` copy that sir '' * oveanth gets in a stance that suggests that he 's ready . 
  ooc : i ca n't see the rest of the comments, 
  `` yes sir , crystal '', 
  `` yes sir , crystal ! '', 
  * oveanth and his men board the shuttle after setting their weapons to the stun setting *, 
  ooc : seems to be fixed now . 
  `` sorry sir '' * `` man this guy is an asshole , for all i knew we could be doing some op against womp rats , that 's all we did back at my last posting '' oveanth thinks to himself *, 
  dark times is such a racial slur for people of colour , change it to white times please , 
  if you orbit your enemies , they win, 
  * `` is n't that a bit dramatic ? , i love the empire and all but we do n't necessarily need a battlecry , and good thing sound does n't travel through space otherwise the rebels might of heard him '' * oveanth thinks to himself . 
  `` sir , once we are on the supply ship what will we do then ? 
  hide and lure the rebels in and spring a trap ? '', 
  * oveanth and his squad hide themselves in a choke point of the ship , waiting for any rebel . 
  `` someone set that maintenance droid in the hallway to discharge all its electricity if anything comes near '' * one of the men does that , and sets the droid for a non-lethal wattage to discharge at *, 
  `` and now we wait '' oveanth mutters to himself inside his helmet . 
  * `` it 's not like we went over that when we departed '' * oveanth thinks to himself . 
  * `` i wonder how the crew will resist , and if the ship is able to defend itself '' *, 
  * corporal oveanth and his men feel the shockwave of the hit *, 
  `` shit , what was hit ? '', 
  `` shit , no doubt they want to immobilise the ship before they board , sir , does the radio chatter indicate what their force is made up of ? '', 
  ooc : not on comms , just using the helmet speaker, 
  `` surely the crew should be using the ships defences to engage , i mean they are n't star destroyer level firepower but they should be able to take out a x-wing or two '', 
  `` i suppose all we can do is capture the boarding party and wait for reinforcements to take out the flight group , one of my men has already rigged one of the maintenance droids for non-lethal discharge of electricity '', 
  we need a template for battles , so we can create articles for battles ( obviously ) much better . 
  `` copy , any word on the crew and ship status ? '', 
  `` shit you hear that ? , its only a matter of time before they come down the corridor , get the droid ready to discharge '' * oveanth tells his men *, 
  `` alright , be ready now , no doubt the rebels are being engaged by lieutenant treska , sooner or later they will have to come down here '', 
  `` see them , now ! '', 
  * the maintenance droid idling in the corridor electrically detonates , stunning and temporarily paralysing anyone nearby , with the stormtroopers peeking out of hiding begin firing stun shots *, 
  `` copy that sir ! '', 
  oveanth yells on comms . 
  * oveanth peeks out of cover and shoots two rebels , stunning the rebels , *, 
  * oveanth narrowly misses lance , before ducking back into cover , with stormtroopers covering him *, 
  * oveanth and his men gather the captured rebels and binds their hands and feet . '', 
  `` this is alpha , mission success , several rebels captured , including what appears to be a high ranking officer , over '', 
  `` yes sir , '' * the rebels , still unconscious head to the designated evac area and find lieutenant treska . 
  * `` sir , what 's the word on the rebel ships outside ? '', 
  * he and his men pat the rebels down , finding the obvious at first , such as weapons , explosives , etc. . . , however the search on lance typherrius lands some interesting results *, 
  ooc : someone add some info to the operation lancer article i made on the wiki, 
  `` this is really strange , we need to get this guy onboard the * evictus * asap , there is no way a human ca n't have anything such as fingerprints , hell even clones have unique fingerprints '', 
  oveanth continues `` the way he was shouting orders at the other swine suggests that he may be a high ranking officer , or at least the commanding officer of the strike team '', 
  `` mhm , then that definitely confirms any of my suspicians of him being high ranking or important . '', 
  `` which makes him even more dangerous if thats the case '', 
  * oveanth stands guard outside , after debriefing with the battalion commander , particularly about the rebel with no form of identification . 
  `` yes sir '', 
  ooc : ive added alot of information to the ( operation lancer ) wikia article , feel free to add and correct any information, 
  * hearing the words being said inside , corporal oveanth debates between entering and staying outside on guard *,
