  * hearing the screams , oveanth definitely decides he is not going in *, 
  ( over comms ) `` sir i 'm hearing shouting in there , and not from or at the detainee , do you require my assistance ? '', 
  `` if you say so sir , over '', 
  ( not on comms ) `` what the fuck is going on in there ? '', 
  * the door opens right next to oveanth , and he turns around and see 's the officers stepping outside *, 
  `` sir ! '', 
  * oveanth just stands there awkwardly , not really shocked at the new revelations since he does n't know lieutenant typherrius that personally , he coughs to let them know of his presence *, 
   whittlins walks up calmly . 
   `` corporal . 
  i heard an interrogation is taking place . 
  is this true ? '', 
  `` yes sir , however ive been given strict orders to not let anyone inside , if you need to then your going to have to talk to the officers having their discussion over there '', 
  `` yes sir , i hope this does n't get me skinned by the battalion commander though '' * oveanth opens the door *, 
  my guy is probably just gon na sleep through the celebration whenever possible , so if shit does hit the fan , its gon na be a real wake up call, 
  im a corporal , so do i have a spot in the chain of command ? 
  `` hi , you dont mind if i sit here ? , im new to this ship so i only know 3-4 people and only in the professional capacity . '', 
  ooc : careful mate , treason does n't go lightly . 
  hail the emperor , glory to the empire, 
  for the empire, 
  * oveanth sits down and places his helmet on the desk , and begins eating a meal with some blue milk *, 
  `` so , how long have you guys been on * the evictus * ? 
  `` far out , what kind of stuff do you usually do around this ship ? , and what people should i know about ? '', 
  `` i already know my co 's and an isb agent , but that 's it '', 
  `` thank you sir , onto another question , what is the history of the evictus ? , the only thing i know about it is its role in the system , and operation lancer which i was apart of '', 
  `` oh and anyone i should stay away from ? '', 
  `` let 's see how badly i get beaten up '', 
  oveanth steps into the ring , against a soldier that appears to have a average build , after engaging in pre fight pleasentry they get into position . 
  ( to the droid ) `` ehm , right '', 
  ( to blackjack ) `` i can already see why you do n't like it '', 
  oveanth wakes up , and starts walking around , only to see everything has gone to hell , he turns to the nearest person `` oi , what the fuck happened here ? '', 
  `` ehm , right sorry , it wo n't happen again '' oveanth says as he continues walking down the corridoors of the * evictus * , and stares at the dead body 's , having a few flashbacks to kashyyyk , which he brushes off and try 's to find lieutenant treska, 
  oveanth walks to the hangar , in all his equipment . 
  [ message from corporal oveanth ] : sir , i was apart of the team that was responsible for the capture of lance , but because of this the rebels chose to strike on our holiday so i feel partly responsible for this , and would be willing to join this task force . 
  [ ooc : damn terrorists ], 
  `` sir , reporting for training . '', 
  oveanth stars shooting at targets , and turns to the lieutenant for tips on how to improve it . 
  oveanth does what he is told , and after a few tries he notices some improvement, 
  oveanth tries the dlt-19 , and has noticed an improvement in long range accuracy and damage , but notes that the weapon will not be too effective in close quarters due to its size . 
  as he hits targets he imagines them as one of those rebel `` sibling fuckers '', 
  `` my most recent experience was back during * operation lancer * , however my posting back on kashyyyk , before i came here obviously , demanded close quarters experience , and it certainly saved my life during the * life day massacre * '', 
  ooc : life day massacre isnt a canon or legend event , however its apart of my characters backstory soo deal with it . 
  oveanth tries the dh-18 , however his inexperience with pistols inhibits him greatly . 
  `` sir , i prefer a short blaster rifle , it allows me freedom of movement whilst packing some power '', 
  oveanth walks in , sees the temporary commander and thinks to himself , * `` has the empire really loosened the physical requirements that much ? 
  '' * , but goes on his way to eat ,, 
  oveanth hears this this in the mess hall , `` maybe the droid is too obsessed with efficiency , if someone gives it complete control over everything then it might deem us humans as expendable or inefficient '', 
  corporal oveanth , making his way out of the mess hall , being reminded about the life day massacre due to the damaged condition of the ship . 
  `` not really sir , we are still reeling in from the attack , we have to get some payback on those cousin fuckers . 
  anyways have you heard about the droid kicking a lot of personnel off the ship , can it do that ? '', 
  `` yeah , but what if it decides to use the ships turbolasers on us as we get deployed ? , nah im just fucking around , but if the droid starts considering us as * inefficient * i swear i will ... '', 
  `` ahhh k. what do you think our next op will be ? 
  a retaliatory strike on the rebels ? '', 
  oveanth bumps into treska as he passes by the offices to get to the mess hall for dinner . 
  `` sorry sir , i did n't see you there . '', 
  as he sits down he takes the moment to asses krendol . 
  * `` fat so therefore most likely lacks the physical requirements for combat , even if it 's not her intended role . 
  and rumors of her being engaged to the captain is concerning , isnt that against regs or something ? 
  * oh shit , i 've been staring at one of my superiors * . 
  oveanth suddenly finds the table really interesting . 
  `` would n't speaking to us and computing responses take up some of your resources , therefore draining efficiency ? '', 
  let it be known that oveanth does n't know much about droids except for detonating them . 
  `` well good day sir '', 
  oveanth see 's that his unit has been called , and heads to the hangars for briefing . 
  `` wow that 's a lot of zeros . 
  alright , onto another topic , if organic are so expendable , then what about force users ? '', 
  `` no but let 's say we have a friendly force user onboard , would you consider them expendable ? '', 
  `` so assuming we have a powerful enough force user , despite being organic for the most part , they can be considered not expendable ? '', 
  oveanth quickly puts the droid on a list of things to bow down to for when the droid overlord rises . 
  `` well i suppose i 've taken enough of your run time , have a efficient orbital cycle . '', 
  ooc : like `` have a good day '' but for the efficiency obsessed droid . 
  `` eh , well anyways since i no longer have any queries it 's time to get back to business , i believe im wanted for briefing right about now . '', 
  `` sir , what 's the environment of area going to be like ? , and what resistance can we expect ? '', 
  `` il tell my men to set for stun , for the most part anyways . '', 
  oveanth loads up in the shuttle , taking breaths inside his helmet . 
  oveanth takes an incognito peek and notices a smirk on her face , before going back to picking at his food . 
  * `` oh yeah i forgot , most officers are pricks '' *, 
  oveanth immidietly gets his squad prepped , and starts going over plans for the assault on the decimated rebel base . 
  `` good thing this helmet blocks out odours , otherwise i would shoot myself just so i do n't have to smell this . '', 
  oveanth turns to the major . 
  `` the tie fighters should of levelled the place , all we are looking for are stragglers now are n't we ? '', 
  * `` oh shit the major is going to beat me for this once we get back on the evictus '' *, 
  `` i meant no disrespect sir . 
  while you two discuss things il have my men set up fortifications just in case another attack happens . '', 
  `` sir , no doubt that even with the bombers we must expect some form of resistance , even if their is likely to be none , once we move through the base close quarters combat is very likely to happen , and due to the ruinous nature of the area we are fighting in we have to be careful for flaming or sharp debris , or ammunition such as slugs or stockpiled ordnance . '', 
  `` and if the rebels were capable of attacks like this on this base , without getting noticed or tracked then what 's the bet they have tunnel systems . '', 
  `` alright sir if you say so , but jungle areas are a bit of expertise where i 'm concerned , and no doubt the small scale insurgency tactics back on kashyyyk will be employed here . '', 
  `` should they survive i 'll add '', 
  oveanth waits for the orders to depart the base . 
  oveanth takes a deep breath and calms down . 
  `` yes sir ! '', 
  `` yes sir '', 
  oveanth turns to the squad `` get prepped to move out in 5 '', 
  ooc ; i 'm gon na go to bed soon , it 's 12:40 am where i live , so i 'm gon na have to make this quick . 
  ( in person to the major ) `` sir , me and the sergeant can take the strike team . '', 
  the strike team starts heading up north . 
  ( over comms to the captain ) `` sir , have we got any info about the tunnel system , perhaps we could use that to infiltrate '', 
  ooc : in heading to bed , night . 
  `` uh , yeah i 'm doing fine , just still trying to make my way around the ship . 
  what about you sir ? '', 
  `` we 'll have good day sir , but i 'm hungry and most be off '',
