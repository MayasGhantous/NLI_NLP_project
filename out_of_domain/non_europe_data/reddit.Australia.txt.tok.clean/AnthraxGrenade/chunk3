  `` what the fuck happened to you sir ? '', 
  `` that 's bullshit , the droid is too damn obsessed with efficiency , it 's already deported men and women from the ship , and my discussion with it proves it believes us all to be expendable . 
  what they 've done to you is unacceptable '', 
  `` yeah , only a few days on this ship and i 'm already seeing some shady stuff going on , things are going to get tougher , guess it 's a matter of who it 's going to get tougher for . 
  that droid needs to be disabled or have its power contained . '', 
  `` surely the captain would be concerned with the crews wellbeing more then what a damm droid wants , why did n't anyone wipe it 's memory banks so it could n't form a personality ? '', 
  `` what are you going to do from here on out sir ? '', 
  `` do n't go to courascant then , the nightlife their may be lively, 
  and vibrant , but even under empire control the casino 's are still corrupt ,, 
  and you can expect your money to be wasted their . 
  may i suggest naboo , it 's a nice planet , not too many casino 's but i imagine them to be quite good based on the reviews i 've seen . '', 
  `` somewhere you ca n't be found eh , well i have n't seen most of the galaxy yet , so i ca n't help you there in that regard , but i would just like to say that in my short time of knowing you , your a great person , and goodbye . 
  oh and kick the droid in the balls on the way out . '', 
  `` you too sir '', 
  oveanth hears the announcement . 
  `` i 'm a new transfer so do i count as a recruit ? 
  better head down to the hangar for whatever they need me for . 
  `` am i late ma'am ? '', 
  `` yes ma'am '', 
  oveanth , admittedly intimidated but otherwise bored , throws a fake enthusiastic `` yes sir '', 
  ooc : oh shit wrong person , fixed, 
  whilst oveanth was cheering with the crew , on the inside it was a different case . 
  * `` what a fucking load of bullcrap , i thought i got away from this type of crap after kashyyyk , man retirement is starting to sound a lot better , also i need to find my commanding officers . 
  oveanth walks into the lieutenants office, 
  `` sir , i 'm here now , il get straight to the point . 
  i believe something very shady is going on , whether it is some struggle for power or something worse i do n't know . 
  but recent events are certainly proving that something is up . '', 
  `` the recent speech from the isb agent that mention two * traitors * and instilled fear in a lot of crew members , the droid removing all the crew members and replacing them . 
  but what stands out the most is blackjacks arrest , i managed to speak with him whilst he was in captivity and he mentioned that he attempted to shut down the droid because he believed it was a danger , and he believed the captain was on his side , but the captain chose the droid . '', 
  oveanth takes a second to catch his breath, 
  `` whilst he did attempt to damage imperial property , the droid has the biggest capacity to become a danger to the crew , especially with its obsession with efficiency coming into play , and my discussion with it earlier proves that the droid considers us all expendable and would in my opinion gladly throw us away if it improves efficiency by .1 '', 
  by the end of the speech oveanth is panting . 
  `` also on a side note , have you seen lieutenant treska ? '', 
  `` yes sir , thank you sir , but seriously where is lieutenant treska ? '', 
  `` well anyways sir , thank you for your time , il take my leave now . '', 
  `` thank you sir . '', 
  oveanth leaves the room . 
  ooc : what the fuck am i reading ? 
  oveanth , despite his drunken state , hears the serious tone of a person nearby and is able to make out a few words , he looks to his right and sees an officer holding up a comm link . 
  seeing this he immidietly books it into the opposite direction . 
  `` you wont catch me you rebel cousin fuckers '' he says with a massive slurring in his voice , muffled a bit by the helmets speakers . 
  oveanth in his drunken state , vomits in his helmet as he proceeds to trip over a wrench left lying around in engineering . 
  oveanth passes out , vomit starting to leak out the helmet , however damage has been done , the person who gave him alcohol has a broken leg , and a mess was made in the air ducts . 
  ooc : screw you . 
  itt : troll tries to tell us that the definition of genocide is wrong . 
  bruce jones , a bomber pilot in the raaf , dead set on bombing the shit out of the axis . 
  corporal oveanth , recovering from the intense hangover and punishment from yesterdays shenanigans . 
  please no, 
  i want 100 % of the earnings due to a possible mention of my name , which is used in my likeness . 
  `` eh , just * oveanth holds his head for a second * dealing with the conse ... quences . 
  `` some ... very ... dumb shit '', 
  `` no shit , guys said they had the strongest stuff in the outer rim '', 
  `` true , i may have also bloodied up the person that gave it to me , i ca n't remember his face and nobody reported into medical so they do n't know who the blood on my shin guard belongs to . '', 
  `` i do n't know , a day perhaps ? . 
  the guy from what i remember pissed me off so i probably , and that 's a big probably , kneed him in the head . 
  anyways you look new here , transfer recently , you 're not the only one , i only got here a few months ago . '', 
  `` good luck . 
  you 'll have to contend with the isb and their * loyalty squads * , sent by their high command , i do n't know if they represent the empire 's interests but it pays to investigate . '', 
  ooc : use '' not ' for speaking, 
  not ooc : `` when were you transferred , and what branch are you from if your here to get rid of the ` unloyal ' people ? '', 
  `` on the * evictus * based off of some story 's , we 'll need you a lot . 
  just be careful around the isb guys , i had to stand guard outside of one of their ` interrogation ' sessions with some rebel we captured in operation lancer '', 
  `` if they smell something odd about you , they will get in your way . 
  just a friendly warning . 
  other then that the * evictus * is the hive of scum only juust better then tatooine . '', 
  `` ehh il just stay out everyones way . 
  anyways good meeting you , if you ever need to find me , i 'll be crying in the maintenance ducts every 5th orbital cycle . '', 
  ooc : should of let blackjack do his thing . 
  oveanth puts his helmet on and comes out from a vent . 
  coincidently near stonewall . 
  `` whats this talk of a prisoner escaping ? '', 
  * advertisement in courascant * `` get these exciting audio books , for only 50 credits + tax you can listen to these awe inspiring speeches that will be sure to arouse your patriotism, 
  and its great for kids too , have your son listen to these and he 'll want to be a crew member of the * evictus * . 
  get it today . 
  `` ahhh k , well il be back inside the ventilation shaft if you need me . '', 
  ooc : why does stonewall consider the current leadership bad ? , they did depose of ravatar . 
  ooc : would n't it make sense to simply request isb high command to have their officers start turning power back to the crew ? 
  also slightly unrelated but ooc : if you need to find oveanth just check the air ducts . 
  it 's only in select very small section , and it 's not like i 'm throwing space mcdonald 's into the maintenance shafts everywhere . 
  oh well , oveanth will have fun in his hideout for the time being , by this point he uses the air ducts and shafts for traval almost exclusively , and spends most his time in it . 
  i still have n't been added to the stormtrooper chain of command . 
  pretty sure i was in thrayces unit . 
   i will put you in a squad under 2nd lieutenant thrayce typherrius, 
  besides my character has worked with his unit almost exclusively . 
  incoming, 
  because parents sex :d, 
  motel room toilet, 
  all g, 
  not like i was n't doing that before though . 
  icon : steam, 
  text : built it myself whooo, 
  * slow clapping *, 
  * oveanth knocks on typherrius 's door , hearing a `` come in '' he opens the door and steps inside *, 
  `` sir , thank you for considering my request , i would like to have a holiday within the system , as i have n't used my holiday hours yet , i thought now that things are relatively calm i may as well use it now . '', 
  `` yes please , so is their anything in particular about this you would like to discuss sir ? '', 
  `` only a night sir , the shit must of come from some outer-rim world like tatooine or something , not much damage was done sir , only some vomit in my helmet and some banter from engineers . '', 
  `` i 've already done my punishment for it '' * ovenath adds quickly *, 
  `` oh their is ? '', 
  by having his mom do it for them . 
  `` thank you for the news sir .
