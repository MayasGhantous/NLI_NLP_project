  moving onto another topic , unrelated to the previous . 
  when 's the next time we can expect to go on a operation ? '', 
  ooc : im heading to bed , il rp tomorrow . 
  `` uhm , copy that sir , moving into other matters , do you have any idea when command of the ship is going to be transferred back to the crew ? '', 
  `` alright , good enough for me . 
  should i postpone any vacation untill whatever operation we are waiting for is over ? '', 
  `` understood sir , alert me when i need to get me squad prepped , il take my leave now sir . '', 
  december this year, 
  its true ... all of it . 
  the stupidity of the rebels only works for the empires gain . 
  let it happen . 
  keyword : almost, 
  this is merely intelligence gathering and stupidity on behalf of the traitors . 
  '' ( stormtrooper roar ) '', 
  what was that part at the end though . 
  did the protagonist of this rebel propaganda see the light and join the empire ? 
  i 'm sure the good work of the isb will be able to fix her mental state from the degeneracy of whatever seditious place she grew up in . 
  you do make an excellent point . 
  as soon as she is arrested she will be prosecuted swiftly , and harshly . 
  nah mate , you got ta look at ramos , * oveanth points to the pod racer that has a pod that can barely hold together , for some reason has a single wheel , is very rusty , with oil seeping out the back *, 
  you got ta be a retard to not realise he will win . 
  what 's up with this aquilaris event ? 
  and how did it affect pod racing , i 've only been starting to watch it recently . 
  `` get comfy mate , i 've got food prepared . '', 
  * he looks at her with a smirk *, 
  `` yea but he has the nc-1964 dual engines on his pod , somewhat old but it beats the stuff the other racers have . '', 
  [ in the race ], 
  several tuskan raiders start ambushing the pod racers . 
  `` i doubt she has the right power capacity and skills to manage all the power output to all of those engines , it 's simply an impossible task for any organic to focus on all those engines and other systems at the same time , and what 's to say it wo n't just blow up ? '', 
  `` suppose so , i 'm putting 12 creds on a tuskan raider shooting the engine and it blowing up '', 
  `` that 's a unique way of putting it '' * `` did n't the roster mention a fire-slug as in command of courage , oh god i 'm going to die '' oveanth thinks to himself *, 
  `` have n't you seen the threat tuskan raiders present at boonta-eve , hell they are a official race hazard . 
  ooh someone just got hit by one '' * oveanth excitedly exclaims *, 
  `` i 'm sure the rock formations and eventual sabotage done by competitors will change your tone '', 
  `` want some rancor legs ? '', 
  `` what about the chasms , the sandstorms , or the eventual load of gun fire ? 
  what other coarses have those ? 
  menaan is the most boring coarse , all it is is just water . '', 
  `` why do n't they set up a course on that endor planet , add those little ewoks as a race hazard and your all set '', 
  `` yeah but then your left with the actually competent pilots , part of the magic of pod racing are the dumbasses that blow up in the middle of a race . '', 
  `` but do n't you just love the look of disappointment and impending doom of those that ca n't even leave the finish line ? , and what about having a low g course ? '', 
  `` nah , what about those high altitude urban courses , it 's a real test of bravery up there , and you often see pilots struggle to stay in their racer , plus all the buildings and incoming traffic make it much more high intensity . '', 
  * oveanth , in the ventilation looks through a grate to see the imposing figure of fire-slug and quickly crawls away *, 
  good thing my character practically lives in their . 
  grand admiral thrawn is so amazing is n't he , capable of changing his race and his genetics for the glory of the empire , a figure all imperial kids want to be when they grow up . 
  the holofilm division will have a field day . 
  only they can bring the message of the grand admiral to the uneducated outer rim planets . 
  so that they may see that if you serve with the imperial navy you serve with someone as great and loyal as him . 
  what 's the difference between a lamborghini and a dead baby . 
  i have n't cum on a lamborghini yet . 
  `` the tuskan raiders are good shots even with their old gaffi sticks . 
  but i suppose good aim comes from being in a culture such as theirs '', 
  `` what about the ruins of taris ? , great urban slash jungle environment to race in . 
  only one podracing match was done their and that was over 60 years ago . 
  you can find footage of it on the holo-net . '', 
  `` i know what it 's like to fight close quarters with a wookie . 
  * he points to the scar on his face * . 
  this is a reminder of it nearly ripping my face off . '', 
  `` that 's assuming another one hasnt already attempted to rip off your arm '', 
  `` wish we had you guys on kashyyyk , i used to be assigned their until the life day massacre , it was a massacre on both the garrison and the wookies . '', 
  `` was that back when the wookies completely rebelled against the republic when it was reformed ? '', 
  `` try and manage one of the slave deportation camp , the fuckers try to tunnel out and it 's hard as fuck to find the tunnels because the tree density blocks scanners . '', 
  `` yeah , but when the wookies all team up on a skeleton garrison , your kinda fucked . 
  ohh and gungans , i remember that one gungan senator from the holo-screens when i was a kid , it gave me nightmares . '', 
  * although disturbed by his inclination for violence , he does n't show it . 
  * `` you mean it just licks stuff ? 
  and these were the creatures that supposedly held off the trade feds ? '', 
  `` of course pod racing is still a thing , have you been living in a krytt dragon cave ? '', 
  `` i 'm pretty sure the 501st got rid of a lot of city 's back when naboo peacefully rejoined the empire '', 
  * this time oveanth is visibly leaning back , he thinks to himself `` shit better change the topic '' * `` so since when was a incinerator a member of the isb loyalty squads ? '', 
  * `` fucking hell nix , your a dumbass , he 's gon na kill you '' * he once again thinks . 
  `` oi nah nothing 's wrong , just the sudden ... outburst just had me caught off guard . 
  ohh and another pod racer goes down , absolutely amazing kill on behalf of the tuskan , shot it 's damn engines out . '', 
  `` i do n't know , i heard something about a aquilaris or something like that , that members of this ship participated in but i do n't know the specifics . '', 
  `` that 's nice , back to wookies , they were perhaps the first and only time i 've truly relished a kill . '', 
  `` what region was that in ? , i was stationed in the most remote corner of the damned world . 
  over there we had to deal with small scale rebellions but we could n't kill because the empire wanted their labour . 
  well we shot that to hell once the life day massacre started . '', 
  `` some random op where they do n't tell you shit and you have to figure out what to do on the fly ? '', 
  ooc : it 's midnight so i 'm heading to bed . 
  `` ahhh , that seems unusual , have you attempted to get them to fix it or contact someone who can ? '', 
  `` well goodluck with that , appears the race had ended , if you need me il be in the air ducts for no discernible reason . '', 
  ooc : what do you mean ? 
  `` nah , i just prefer the vents over the other places , it 's sort of become my kind of thing , * he whispers the next part : * besides i do n't trust that droid . '', 
  `` uh ... yes sir . '', 
  goodbye fps, 
  the human eye can not see more then 2 colours . 
  why do n't you accept that not everyone on this website speaks american english . 
  nah i did n't see that , sorry . 
  i got poor eyesight so i could n't exactly see that . 
  good afternoon mr trump . 
  my birth, 
  ooc : traitor, 
  thanks guys . 
  * `` eh , its her again , never did get her name , did n't think a officer played gambling games '' *, 
  oveanth walks over, 
  `` sup , good game i assume ? '', 
  * `` an alien on a world with high imperial activity trying to drown his sorrows ? 
  cant say i blame him '' *, 
  `` how much have you won ?
