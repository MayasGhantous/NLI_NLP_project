  enough to buy a second evictus ? '', 
  oveanth nods , before taking a second to scan the crowd before him , only to see some aliens and a human whispering before moving away into the crowd . 
  * `` now why would they feel the to whisper , seems fishy * '', 
  `` il be right back , gon na get a drink '', 
  ooc : do i need someone else to roleplay the suspicious people ? , end ooc, 
  oveanth manages to follow the group , down a alleyway , only to find them making several turns , no doubt to shake him off their tail . 
  after following this group for a while he gives up and goes back to the canteen , ordering 2 drinks at the bar and heading back to the table . 
  `` i got some drinks , not enough to ruin any logical thought but still good enough . '', 
  ooc : / u/lizardcomander, 
  after following this group for a while he gives up and goes back to the canteen , ordering 2 drinks at the bar and heading back to the table . 
  `` i got some drinks , not enough to ruin any logical thought but still good enough . '', 
  ooc : / u/lizardcomander, 
  oveanth comes out of some random hatch in the ceiling . 
  `` what problems are you having that demand you drink them away ? '', 
  `` i 'm not putting all of them in , got ta bet on the pod racers too '', 
  * oveanth sits down . 
  `` whoah , okay then , il just take my leave now '', 
  * oveanth nervously backs away into another random hatch , but this time in the wall , a few seconds later screams that sound suspiciously like `` help im in the garbage compacter '' `` fuuuck wrong hatch '' and `` ahhh snake monsters fuck '' can be heard . 
  `` what 's his specs ? 
  and what course are they on ? '', 
  `` an arc ? 
  you 'd think they would all be dismantled after the war , guess he must of got it from some battle everyone 's forgot about , guess i know where i 'm putting my credits in '', 
  * oveanth takes a sip of his drink *, 
  `` i agree , however one significant disadvantage is they they can present a higher profile , especially with those wings , the tie 's profile is small and can go incredibly fast , although it lacks the surviveabiility of the arc 's '', 
  `` which is why i mentioned surviveabiility , however the empires combat philosophy is quantity over quality . 
  and due to the fact that the tie is somewhat reliable and very cheap , it 's no wonder we use it now rather then the 170 's '', 
  `` what about the rebel scums x-wings ? , those things look like they are based on the 170 's , or at least look like they use similar hardware . '', 
  `` mhm , it is a amazing fighter , however im concerned where the rebels could of gotten the people to design such a fighter , or the parts and blueprints for it , or what materials they 've had to acquire '', 
  `` must of missed that part of the memo , but how could an entire corporation disappear , no one goes into the unexplored systems and the isb should of been doing background checks on them , or were they too busy ousting each other or something ? '', 
  `` ahh ok , on the topic of ships , * a human at the table screams out in rage at his loss * , what about the venator class ships , that ship can deploy all manner of ships quickly and because of the smaller profile of the bridge boasts better protection for command staff '', 
  * oveanth sighs in disappointment * `` there goes half my creds . 
  anyways in my opinion the venators look alot better then the imp class star destroyers , why does n't the empire use paint in their designs to help differentiate legions ? 
  shame a lot of them were left to drift in space '', 
  `` sure we have some still in service but venators were discontinued and a lot were in fact abandoned at the end of the clone wars , and sure the impstars are massive and intimidating , but in my opinion the venators just look better '', 
  ooc : look at this random corporal who thinks hes an expert, 
  ooc : im going off the legends part of the wiki, 
  `` after the end of the clone wars , many republic venators were abandoned and left to drift in space.this led to even more fringe groups obtaining venators , as well as several imperial moffs , who used them in their private defense fleets , and for their various militias . '', 
  `` well alright then if you say so , * oveanth hands over a credit chit * and you 've beat me , suppose im done here , il be at my apartment drinking myself to oblivion '', 
  * oveanth , only in the hanger bay temporarily notices the new arrival . 
  `` great , probably another robot that considers us as wastes of space '' he thinks to himself . 
  `` i should probably try and find out about it though . 
  `` oi droid , whats your purpose here ? '', 
  ooc : not the most polite of introductions, 
  `` reproduction and to serve the empire , you ? '', 
  `` what job is that ? '', 
  `` i 'm unfamiliar with your model . '', 
  sure , count me in . 
  remember to message / u/dronnac for access to the team sub . 
  if he doesnt give it to you when you comment . 
  `` explain your average tasks '', 
  * oveanth lets loose , immidietly rushing to get off the ship , whilst renting out an apartment through his mini-computer . 
  i need someone to roleplay the dealer . 
  `` i need certain goods that i 've heard you 'll be able to provide , for the right price of course , and i 'm nobody important , trust me . '', 
  `` armour , for personal protection . 
  it 's illegal for ordinary civilians to have armour and i just need some to put in a safe house for a long time . 
  i should have enough credits . '', 
  `` let 's go for something a little bit more exotic . '', 
  `` whatever you have available , i do n't want something that will suck out all my creds , but i want it to be stronger then your typical armour . '', 
  `` wow , phrik ? , that would go extremely well , how about durasteel chest plates with a small phrik layering , and phrik gauntlets . ? '', 
  `` plenty , i can contract a shipping company to take it to my, 
  safe house , so i do n't have to be here for when it 's supplied . '', 
  * `` fuck , that 's gon na take my savings , fuck it . 
  everything 's provided by the empire for now anyways , and i have enough left over to contract that shipping company , il always just make it back eventually '' *, 
  `` alright then , * oveanth hands over a credit chit * `` make sure that the nevrox shipping company gets this , they 'll know where to send it to . '', 
  `` just a tip , i hear nevrox is one of the many black suns fronts , they wo n't appreciate cargo not arriving '', 
  `` good doing business with you sir . '', 
  `` nix , that 's all i 'm telling you . '', 
  ooc : nix oveanth is my full name, 
  `` no , i 'm done here . 
  good day sir . '', 
  ooc : alright this sequence is done now . 
  `` well excuuuusssee me for not knowing what the fuck your model is , if the average person cant recognise it then you must be pretty shit '', 
  ooc : this is what i imagine the [ armour ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/deathbattlefanon/images/6/60/locus_true.png/revision/latest?cb=20150903093044 ) [ looks ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uy3kaql.png ) like, 
  locus from red vs blue, 
  ooc : [ thread that i purchased it in ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/swdarktimes/comments/4f7259/looking_for_gear/ ), 
  ooc : my eyes , they burn . 
  ooc : this is in my apartment on sanbra , unless your knocking on my door i have no idea why your here . 
  * `` fucking poof , like all other droids , hope it and istau have a bitch fight and it gets ejected . 
  besides my careers been mostly successful so fuck him . 
  ooc : he 's not using it , its kept at a safehouse on his homeworld . 
  for when he ever does leave the empire . 
  super expensive and the gauntlets are made out of phrix ( mod approved ) which allows it to resist lightsabers and shit . 
  ooc : besides i dont think their are phrix-durasteel combination armour set in the sw universe so you got ta put shit in . 
  you guys do realise that the radical feminist is a joke account right ? 
  whooo , the recognition is amazing . 
  that `` meanwhile , on the armijians ' western front tank ... . '' sounds so typical of us, 
  ooc : whatd i miss ? 
  ooc : channel your inner palpatine , do it . 
  turn him to the dark side and do a rebel order 66 . 
  * oveanth knocks on the door * `` hello , anyone in he ... oh its you sir . '', 
  * corporal oveanth was just wandering the hanger bay , wondering what the commotion is *, 
  ooc : / u/rebelspy99, 
  as if thats not foreboding . 
  there are plenty of civs for each team . 
  if 2 teams are both going for one civ , they should have a backup civ in mind . 
  and have the mods do a paper scissors rock type thing and decide who gets it . 
  but that 's my opinion . 
  `` your immediate superior . 
  it has recently come to my attention that you are the new addition to alpha-b in courage company , correct ? '', 
  `` then your definitely in my squad , pleasure to meet you , * oveanth extends his hands for a handshake * , i 'm corporal oveanth .
